I guarantee if Gordon Ramsey wasn't on the cover no one would be here. I would not come back. $21.00 for a burger that is just ok not worth it.",

My coworker had the lobster mac and cheese, which while decadent and creamy, wasn't really that much of a standout.  Take it or leave it.

    "text": "There are a lot of things to love about Vegas (how could you not love Vegas?!), but one of the biggest reasons is how there's bound to be something for everyone.  Gambling, drinking, shopping, shows, good looking girls (and guys I suppose...), eating...the list goes on!  So on a Saturday afternoon, with the girls ditching us to spend the afternoon shopping at the Forum, the rest of us decided to have a boys afternoon out with snacks and beer.  Sure, it might not be something unique to Vegas, but it is when it's Gordon Ramsay's cooking!  Or perhaps, his most recent Hell's Kitchen winner, Ja'nel Witt? (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#IX8KiLMIq2gdLA1YLH9qzA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>)  -- DUCK CONFIT POUTINE - Hand-Cut French Fries, Duck Gravy, and Duck Confit...$13/$12** (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#bK8tscNQn2pNWV4mGvk5gQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>) It may not have been the most authentic poutine (no cheese curds), but it was really good.  Though the fires could have been crispier, the cheese and duck formed this gooey deliciousness and the gravy added a ton of flavor.  -- PUB \"SPOTS\" - Three Mini House Blend Pub Burgers, Wood-Grilled, Pub Burger Sauce, Welsh Cheddar Cheese 15/14** (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#PaRgkpXefjqsJPBb5StThA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>) Based strictly on taste, it was pretty solid.  The patty had a nice char and the blend of meat was terrific.  We forgot to add the smoked applewood bacon, but it wasn't necessary.  That said, I wouldn't get this again simply because of price - essentially $5 per half dollar sized slider and the bacon would have been $3.00 more overall.  **NOTE: Menu prices are slightly cheaper if you have a Total Rewards player's card.  Despite the hefty price tag on the Pub Spots (pricey even for Vegas), I'd certainly come back to try an actual entree and to get another order of the Poutine.  And who knows, maybe I'll see Gordon Ramsay there...yelling about something.",

I got the scallops with a side of grilled asparagus.  The scallops were buttery and they melted in your mouth.  The sweet corn spread that was on the plate gave them the best compliment.   There was nothing small about the food either.  The asparagus was the same size as full sized thing of mascara.  The scallops were half dollar sized. My fiance got the salmon and it was juicy and the skin was nice and crisp. Our friend got the fish and chips.  He said that they were good.  He gave them a 7 out of 10.  My fiance's dad got the Hell's Kitchen burger and he couldn't point out anything wrong with it.  I have to say, I will be back to Vegas, even if it is just to stop long enough for this food.",

The fish n' chips were cooked perfectly!! The fish flakey and tender inside and batter crispy on the outside. The execution was so good it seemed as if they were independently cooked. Only qualm is that it was under seasoned.  The lamb burger was pleasant. You can taste the slight distinctiveness of the lamb without it being overwhelming. The burger was also flawlessly cooked to a MedRare. Although the burger was cooked perfectly, the portion of condiments inside (goat cheese and slaw) could have been been bigger because the burger was also slightly dry due to an over toasted bun. Good food all around with the exception of a couple of misses.",

We are local to Las Vegas, so it was fun to visit the strip for dinner.  We had 6:30 reservations but arrived at around 6 and was taken to our table without a wait.  The table and chairs were very comfortable and the big screens located throughout the restaurant provided for a fun, pub-style atmosphere.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and made our experience enjoyable.   I had the fish and chips, my wife had the shephard's pie, my son the lamb burger and my daughter the butter curry.  All dishes were very tasty and met our expectations.  I paired by fish and chips with an Innus & Gunn beer which hit the spot.  We all shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert - also tasty.  The only thing that was a disappointment was the fact that they discontinued the Total Rewards discount and they have nothing in place for locals (as many other restaurants in tourist areas do).  Nonetheless, I was expecting to pay Gordon Ramsey prices, so it was not a shock.  The food was good, service great and overall experience was fantastic.  Definitely a once-in-a-while only type of experience for us given the cost, but worthwhile!",

The buns were toasty and delicious. They definitely didn't short us on meat.   Wings - Spicy and sweet. My fiance thought they were really spicy but I thought they had the perfect amount of kick. I usually don't like blue cheese but the blue cheese dipping sauce it came with were a perfect match for the wings!   Brussel Sprouts - Nicely caramelized.  Tender with a crunch.

While my girlfriend and I have been sitting for 10 minutes reviewing the menu, in comes Roger. Speed talking through his introduction, then proceeds to YANK the menu out of my girlfriends hands, flips it over and says \"Drink menu is here, I'll be back in 5 minutes when you decide\" and hurries off...   Meanwhile we decided on what to eat and drink about 9 minutes earlier.   He comes back after being away for 10 minutes. We both oder our drinks. Then he tries to rush off again. We say, \"Wait, we're ready to order our food, also\". He looks inconvenienced about this...   Girlfriend orders the braised short ribs. No issues there.  I order the 10oz Prime Flat Iron.   Roger proceeded to chime in: \"If you want a steak, stay away from that one. It's poor quality and a bad cut of meat. You should really oder the 14oz Ribeye\" -- this is $6 more...   Obviously if I wanted a ribeye I'd order a ribeye....  Anyway, I saw right through his up-sell, and kept my order.  As expected, the steak was fantastic.   When he comes to clear we say no dessert, thanks. He says \"you're no fun\", in a non-jovial tone, and walks off. We request the bill. Get ignored for a good 10 minutes -- meanwhile the place is barely 1/4 capacity...  I expected more from a Ramsay restaurant. Quality of food (which was A+) and server experience go hand in hand.  Would definitely not return here... I was very disappointed.  We saved up for this meal and booked it weeks in advance and were really looking forward to the experience as a whole. We're Gordon Ramsay fans, and this was our one 'nice' dinner out together. Our expectations were certainly not met.",

    "text": "Took a little longer than we'd like to have our waiter come back so we could ask for a box and dessert. They did come back to check on us once and to be fair we may have just ate fast.   The restaurant is clean and everyone was so friendly. We'd been here two years ago and I was honestly disappointed. I had a burger that was at least $20 and lacked flavor so I sighed when my husband wanted to come try it again today. Luckily there has been some significant changes made because the only sigh today was one of nothing but satisfaction.   I tried the Shepherds Pie and found it came with a tiny salad and a pretzel stick. The plating was beautiful. The pie itself was phenomenal and super filling. As someone that hates to waste money, I'd spend $25 bucks again any day for a pie from here. My husband got the Banger & Mash which I saw on the menu and didn't think it would be something I'd care too much for. I took a spoonful off his plate though and serious self control was needed to not take another (even though he kept picking at my pie). It's fancy enough to make you feel cool and sophisticated but not so fancy that you (me) feel out of place showing up in converse and jeans. We got a free dessert! The sticky toffee pudding which was BLISS and a piece of art with ice cream served in a small chocolate bowl. I highly recommend.",

The braised beef stew was horrible. There were three tiny pieces of beef all smaller than a nickel!  For $30!  It was mostly gravy with a side hard piece if pretzel bread.   The last comment was on the smell of their hallway. It's that musty/moldy mop water smell. Come on, for what we paid for lunch, everything should have been a lot better.   This place is all hype, don't bother.",

The food was actually better than we expected. I ordered the braised short rib as entree and lobster roll which was shared with my friend. The short rib was tender and flavorful, not to mention their mashed potato. The lobster roll is a must try too if you are a seafood lover but don't want too much before enjoying your entree. As for service, our waiter is Rodney and he is very nice. We had a group of 6 and he was very patient with each of us when ordering. He also frequently refilled our water. Definitely worth a try here",

The selection of this restaurant is mainly based on convenience, as we usually stay at Caesar's. This review is also limited with regard to food, as we normally get a hamburger and a salad. Service has been excellent, as all three times the servers were friendly, pleasant, and very accommodating. The hamburger is cooked as ordered, Caesar salad fine (dressing a little bland) and the French fries are particularly enjoyable. Prices are on the high side (1 burger, 1 caesars salad, 2 coffees - about $50, incl tax) but about what is expected for Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.",

I was super excited to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and my expectations were met by this lovely dinner. You should try this place!  Starters: Crispy Calamari, Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls. The calamari was perfectly cooked and such a nice portion, perfect crisp coating, with a great twist with the pickled peppers, highly recommend getting this to start. The main lobster and shrimp rolls were good, but something I could have skipped. The bread roll was really buttery, too buttery and that's coming from someone that loves butter on bread. The filling was tasty, good ratio of filling to bread, just wish it wasn't overly buttered.  Mains: Fish & Chips, Braised Short Rib, Grilled Bacon Burger, Grilled Lamb Burger, Prime Flat Iron. Best Fish & Chips ever! Super crisp thin coating, perfectly cooked and seasoned fish on the inside. The Braised Short Rib was delicious, fell apart beautifully. The Grilled Bacon Burger was alright, better than your average burger but there are better menu options (but the fries were so good). Grilled Lamb Burger I didn't try, but my mom really enjoyed. Prime Flat Iron, such a perfectly seasoned steak, and with the peppercorn brandy sauce it was truly an experience.   Sides: Lobster Mac n Cheese. As if we didn't order enough food, had to try the lobster mac n cheese. It was a massive portion, but unfortunately it didn't have enough salt. Nice creamy texture with generous amounts of lobster, just wish it was seasoned more.",

Not only did he make some good recommendations but he also suggested the sticky toffee pudding for us to share in celebration of our anniversary trip. If you are ever in Vegas and in Caesars Palace Forum shops, go to the Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill for some great food.

Firstly hubby  and friends ordered the fish and chips I had the butternut squash soup.  Within in four minutes of ordering our food even before out drinks showed up out comes our food.  So hear we go  you can't call garden peas bashed with a spoon mushy peas anyone who knows anything about British food knows mushy peas have to go through a process to be entitled to that name.  The food tasted reheated which it had to be unless they have the fastest deep fat fryer known to man.  Chips were soggy French fries and I won't even try to describe the tasteless mushy Cod (peas mushy fish not is a good way to go.  Soup was ok just ok but for $13 I was expecting some flavour.  Thought I would mention to the manager how disappointed we were and not Yelp.  He was so not bothered and I was very diplomatic he said he would look into and just walked back to the front desk.  Come on people show you at least care and Gordon if you are going to put your name to something please at least check they are doing your name some favours I am a huge fan but not of this place.  We sat at 8.15 and were out of there by 8.50 these guys make MacDonalds look slow.  Give it a miss folks.",

I read many of the less than stellar reviews and decided they were likely posted when they first opened and that by now they have the kinks worked out. This was a horrible experience riddled with questionable food and terrible service. When you pay $27 for fish and chips you want it to be the best or very close to it. The batter on the fish was way to heavy and thick. The fries were limp. They'd been sitting in a warmer way too long. They were almost soggy. My daughter could even eat her burger. I thought it was funny they didn't even ask about the burger when 3/4 of it is left our her plate when we finally got our bill. I also didn't get the chilled water and no ice in the glass thing. I asked if we could get ice and they brought me ice, not the rest of the table. Then every time we needed a refill we had to ask for it. Gordon Ramsey, maybe you could sign this place up for Kitchen Nightmares. Then you could go in a fix it.",

    "text": "My husband and I celebrated my birthday at the Pub and Grill today. We didn't have reservations and did not have to wait for a table ( we arrived about  12pm) . Our water glasses were filled right after we were seated and our waiter came in less than five minutes to show us the drink menu on the I Pad. Joe ( our waiter) suggested a beer for my husband who is not a beer drinker and he made an excellent choice. I had a Salted Caramel apple martini which was delicious. The drinks came promptly. Joe then came back and took our order remembering I was talking about having the fish and chips. The food came sooner than I expected. My husbands mussels and clams were done to perfection! My order of fish and chips was soooo good I ate everything! I even would have enjoyed a bigger portion of the mushy peas. Our table was bussed promptly and Joe asked if we wanted the Sticky toffe pudding for dessert......ummm YES! I even got a candle to blow out!   Overall I would recommend trying this place out. Our waiter was attentive and made great suggestions...I am not a drinker by any means and I am usually too full to finish my dinner let alone have dessert....everything about our lunch was a wonderful experience! Chef would be pleased!",

I can't speak for any of the other food.   The burger is really good!  Perfectly seasoned, moist and the smokieness of the smoked apple bacon was perfect.  Fries are amazing too.  Thick, fresh cut, and potatoey.  If you want a good burger, this is the place.  Service is excellent too.  My wife and I shared the burger and the waiter kindly had it split up for us.  He was honest up front and told us it was big enough to share.  Give it a try for lunch if you are there.",

One piece was so salty, couldn't eat. I have had better food at a fast food joint, and paid ALOT less. It's obvious Ramsay cares only about the money he makes. If this restaurant had to rely on repeat business, it would be closed in a year. Only bright spot was sticky toffee desert.",

It's also very loud once you do get seated, having a conversation is nearly impossible.  Add to that the fact that I was sitting at a small table for two in an arm chair that belongs next to a fireplace putting the table at approximately the height of my armpits, it made for an uncomfortable dining experience logistically speaking.  Once I resigned myself to the fact that I could not fit in a booster seat and who has phone books to sit on anymore,  the food was really quite good.  I ordered the salmon which was cooked to perfection and my husband ordered the burger which was also very good.  The real star, however, was dessert.  We shared the pumpkin bread caramel layered thing (I cannot remember what it was called) and savored every last morsel.  Just don't order the cucumber vodka drink - it's not even worth remembering what it's called.  The Ramsay something-or-other.  That was $15 I'll never get back.",

    "text": "Oh, I do adore an authentic British pub and grill! Sadly, it would appear that rather than pay homage to all things British, Gordon Ramsay has chosen for his new pub at Caesars Las Vegas to be decidedly, well, \"Vegas.\" There are some delightful menu items that you would find in a typical pub, however, the decor is a confusing mix of casino tackiness and partially abandoned distillery. Much of the restaurant is open to the casino and the rest is a hodgepodge of randomly selected items any Anglophile would order from Amazon. The only part of the restaurant that harkened toward anything truly 'pub-like\" was the bar. Ray-Ray, the bartender on staff, was a hoot and I'd probably go back just to chat with him again. (We left him a tip double the cost of our meal partly because of his compassionate care of an elderly couple we assume must be regulars). Much of the wait staff is also typical Vegas, so you may or may not be concerned about strange bosoms falling out as they deliver your meal. We really only wanted a light nosh and a cocktail, so thought sticking with appetizers and salads was the best way to sample the fare. I must admit that I broke a cardinal rule in straying from \"typical\" pub fare and ordered the lobster roll, simply because I am desperate to have at least one great one each year. (For any who've read any of my reviews on Tripadvisor, you'll note I made the same mistake at Hilton Head Island in March, 2015.) I should have listened to my husband! He ordered the Wedge Salad and he truly enjoyed the Shropshire bleu cheese paired with the bacon vinaigrette, I ordered a Maine Lobster roll on lemon poppy seed brioche. (I know!) I was so anticipating that first, delightful bite of buttery richness from the roll that looked as if it was lovingly slathered and grilled face down, anticipating it would complement the rich, slightly sweet creaminess of the lobster salad. And then, the music died. As I deconstructed the roll, I noticed that the butter was probably brushed across the top, then the bread was slid through a pizza oven so that only the bare top was toasted. The rest was a fairly dry, barely lemon or poppy seed flavored brioche. Disappointed again. I'd like to say that maybe they were having an off day since it was shortly before Las Vegas' annual Bon Appetite event that was being held at Caesars, but would have to make plans to visit again when we return in June. This time, I'll try the Frog in a hole or the Bangers and Mash. With so many other places to try on the Strip, a restaurant can't just be okay; it has to rock your socks off. We travel to Las Vegas multiple times a year, and consider ourselves to be \"foodies,\" and will normally give a place two bites of the apple so to speak. If we are disappointed again; we won't be back.",

    "text": "We went there for lunch, figured it would be nice to eat in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, even if it's a cheaper one (well, not really, let's say cheap for Vegas...). So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so.   So we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade.   Mr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Quebec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there.",

    "text": "We were thrilled to WIN a dinner at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We watch his shows and thought dinner would be amazing. The first two items we ordered were \"86ed\". We said that was too bad since we really wanted to have them and the waiter replied that it was \"good\" since they were busy that night.  Good for him, bad for us,  but it didn't occur to him to think that way.  My husband ordered rack of lamb, and since the apps we wanted were not available he asked about the portion size and was told it was \" three bones\". When  the dish came with two, he asked the waiter about it and the waiter said he would check with the kitchen, then came back and told us he was misinformed  and the serving  went by weight. However, he agreed that it looked like a double cut chop, not a rack of lamb for $38. The meat was chewy,had no sauce, & needed seasoning. My  scallops, a dish Ramsay routinely dumps in the trash on his show, were nicely browned but served in a tasteless broth that made them a soggy mess. Although our waiter became more apologetic when the table next to us also complained about their lamb, and brought us a complimentary dessert, it was a really disappointing meal. Like the woman at the table next to us said, \" This restaurant is a Kitchen Nightmare and needs fixing.\"",

We were greeted by our nice waitress Stacy. The manager Joe came to our table with glasses of champagne.

He even gave my kids limited edition Gordon Ramsay Uncharted National Geographic magazines. He always came by our table to make sure everything was perfect. As expected we absolutely LOVED the Beef Wellington, divers scallops, fish & chips, and the burger.  Everything was cooked perfectly! Joe went above and beyond our expectations by even serving our food to the table and explaining each dish. He even had cool Gordon Ramsay stories to share with us.

Kid friendly- our eleven year old was the one who pushed to dine here. We were all pretty happy- lamb and pork shanks, fish and chips and chocolate pudding for dessert. Simple and truly delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive but not in our face and that takes skill. We plan to be back but we're going to try all the Ramsay spots in Vegas at the request of our son.",

After reading mixed reviews of the place my expectations weren't very high. But, I walked away impressed with several of the dishes. Crispy calamari was mixed with pickled peppers and dill, their Hellfire chicken wings had a decent amount of heat but wasn't overpowering, and the kettle chip nachos were a great rendition topped with corned beef, short rib, and covered in an English cheddar cheese sauce.  Entrees didn't disappoint either. The fish in the Yorkshire ale batter fish and chips were tender and flaky with a crispy, light exterior that provided a nice contrast. My favorite dish of the night was the grilled lamb burger. An excellent burger cooked to medium as ordered with bold flavors from the curry onions, goat cheese and feta spread that topped it.",

They came out cold and hard which is a shame because they are one of my favorite items.  I did not complain because everything else was great. I am sure if I had, they would have fixed it. The truffle fries were absolutely delicious and the house burger was good.  The sticky toffee pudding was yummy too. The best part of my visit though was the bartenders! They were super friendly, very attentive and fun.  Actually the entire staff that I interacted with was friendly. I watched them deal with a very rude customer  and they handled it like pros!

We went there mainly because of the Gordon Ramsey name (and because Hell's kitchen was booked up) and gosh were we disappointed! I suspect Gordon Ramsey has never tasted anything there, or else he would have taken his name off immediately! The fish and chips we ordered were dry, greasy, and overcooked. The fries were slightly more edible than the fish. And the side of split peas mush? I had to spit it out immediately to avoid extensive retching. The prime rib would have been passable for a $20 dish, but for a $55 dish, I would have expected much more than a meh. All in all, this was the worst dinner we had during our three-day weekend in Vegas. And can Gordon please visit this place? I would like to see the chef's apron taken away.",

The shaved vegetable salad had 4 shavings of carrot and snow peas and too little arugula.  The truffle  fries were extremely salty, very small portion and the oil was all on a few fries at the bottom. This restaurant did not provide taste or value.",

Kegs are used in lieu of wall separations and the table we were seated at was really \"homey\" This was my first Ramsey experience so I was anxious to see if his establishments could hold up to the cartoon scrutiny he puts the contestants through on his over wrought Hell's Kitchen show. Are his restaurants held to the same standard? I would have to say GRP&G is up to snuff. The menu is interesting but smallish even for a lunch but it certainly does not lack variety. Chicken pot pie and a beef pot pie are available as well as the expected Shepard's pie. .We saw several burgers being served and they were huge! Nice touch adding beer suggestions with each dish. I did not partake but thought the beer pairing idea was genius. We choose to start with a Scotch Egg that was delightful but the chipotle and mustard sauce took took it to another level, We also tried the shrimp cocktail that was ....a shrimp cocktail...Not bad,  just not special. I tried the braised beef rib and it was very <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgood.It&s=4f4646068521a9a1395ad36bb7940401f4066c3b464f8a56dfc270f83958c8cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">good.It</a> was served over a risotto (and no...I heard no screaming coming from the kitchen) that was nice. Desert however went to a new level of decadence.  A brownie, topped with cheesecake, topped with Rocky Road ice cream, covered in chocolate and to add to the party a magnificent caramel sauce on the side. No fellow Yelpers, this is not Gordon Ramsey light! Service was ...interesting. Good, fast, ..really spot on with the timing ....but...well..leave it to say our server was ....interesting. I've seen a few trash reviews here complaining about 12 dollar fish and chips? Come on ...it's a celebrity chef venue inside Caesar's Palace!  Were you looking for a Denny's? All in all a pretty nice experience and I would try dinner next time. ...If you do get the same sever we got ...and you will know if you do ...Let me know if the word interesting applies!",

I watched his show so I was in fact curious to try. when I arrived the one hostess told another to take me there but she was doing her own thing with her bag facing her back toward me and then another guy came so the first hostess asked him to take me to table. He was not really greeting me and I kinda just follow him. Then he seemed lost and didn't know which number is located where. He showed me to a wrong table and asked if I know how they looked. Fortunately for him, I knew I was supposed to meet all Koreans so I could locate my own table. When they brought appetizers, they didn't bring extra spoons or forks so I had to use my personal fork to get food from the plate which was supposed to be shared with others. And then the main dish was not really more than average. Most dishes were too salty. He shouldn't expand fast and big if he can't find right management to control the quality. What a shame. I will never go back. Over priced. Dreadful food. Bad and unprofessional service. Food is too salty or too sweet.",

We decided to get a snack and ordered the crispy bait (some name like that).  The small fish were perfectly fried and had a crispy, light breading.  We changed from the standard lemon aioli to the curry aioli served with a separate menu item and really enjoyed that with the fish.  Maybe they could make an aioli choice with these standard on the menu.  Bar service was perfect and we appreciated bartender Rains work.  We will definitely stop in again next time we are in Vegas!",

We had a great time with Adam who guided us through an awesome dining experience. If you go to the bar ask for Adam. However there is one problem virtually all the bar tenders are named Adam. But no worries it seems they are all above average. Ok now the important part the food. It having Ramsey's name carries high expectations. I am happy to say they were meet. I need to particularly point out the Shepherd's Pie. This is something I would normally avoid because of my stepfather's failed attempts. His was the worst thing I ever ate. Gordon's was the best thing I have ever had.  I will be back again and again. Finally a famous chief opens a very approachable place and blows away expectations. Good Job!!!",

    "text": "Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. We were in town for my husband's birthday and wanted to try something fun and unique. Ambience was crowded and noisy, not what we were hoping for but understandable due to location (open walls inside Caesar's palace) and the pub theme. Service was friendly and prompt. We ordered chicken kale and bacon pot pie and the kettle nachos. The nachos were delicious. Thick, crispy potato chips with an English cheddar cheese sauce, braised beef and sweet peppers. They're were surprisingly filling, but there were only peppers and meat on the top, not layered it's the chips. Since we got them during happy hour, the price was reasonable for what we received, but we would have felt robbed if we'd paid full price. The pot pie was under seasoned, and there was no salt or pepper at the table. The waitress came to ask if we wanted any halfway through the meal. The bacon pieces in it were fatty and limp, the crust was soggy, and there were maybe 5 pieces of kale in the whole thing. Portion was small by American standards, which was what I expected and would have been fine except that it didn't come with any sides. Odd for a dinner entree, and really ridiculous for the $24 price. To cap it off, I informed the waitress that we were celebrating my husbands birthday at the start of the meal, and other than a \"oh happy birthday!\" nothing was done. Maybe it's just the restaurant policy, but really, would it break the bank to bring out a scoop of ice cream or something? Overall the meal and experience were a huge let down.",

Usually we have gone to Gordon Ramsay Pub for happy hour to enjoy the excellent beer selection (Mike makes a very good Black and Tan) and the happy hour menu (the Pigs in a Blanket and Truffle Fries are fantastic).  On our last visit we decided to have dinner and it didn't disappoint. The meal was absolutely great. The Beef Wellington was classic Ramsay and as good as any we have had at any of his restaurants. The lobster Mac and cheese was perfect, better than we have had anywhere in Las Vegas. But the star of the night was the Seared Diver Scallops.  Absolutely incredible. Not small scallop portions but large perfectly cooked sea scallops with an incredible corn puree. It immediately became one of my wife's favorites of any restaurant in Las Vegas, and an excellent value. The entire staff and management are professional,  and go above and beyond to insure a great experience. Add a great wine selection and first class service from our server Mike, and you have the recipe for a fantastic evening. We will continue to go to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas but Gordon Ramsay Pub is now a must for Dinner on each trip.",

We started with a gargantuan 35 ounce mug of Guinness that was fresh from the draft - smooth and complex flavors without being bitter. Guinness in bottles is a pale reflection of the draft version.  The entrees were just flat out excellent - the shepherd's pie was comfort food perfection. The lamb shank was wonderful, slow cooked till tender with peas in a sumptuous sauce. The lamb flavor is smooth and clean without the off putting smell or strong taste that some people associate with lamb.   The dessert was a warm toffee pudding a la mode. I've had toffee pudding in England, Scotland, and Ireland and this was one of the best. Subtle and spicy with a sweet (but not overly sweet) buttery taste. By the way the toffee pudding was free courtesy of checking in, and not toned down or cut in half as many restaurants grudgingly provide check in perks. Service was outstanding our server, Carl, frequently checked and anticipated our needs in a friendly and knowledgeable manner.",

He offered great drinks, apps, and our main course! Get the lobster rolls, don't think about it just order them. Also the flat iron steak was cooked to perfection! We also have the fish and chips and the white cheddar Mac, both solid choices as well. We topped it off with dessert and loved it! If you are looking for a Ramsey restaurant come here! The only thing that could have made this better is if Gordon himself was here!",

My nephew and his wife loved the Mac and cheese with lobster. We all truly enjoyed the lobster rolls as they were very tasty.   This place is very trendy and it made for a perfect spot for us to talk the afternoon away. We loved our servers and it was very sweet for him to interact with Mom in Spanish.   So why 3 stars? I've been watching Gordon sell his restaurants on tv and on YouTube for years. I think I expected the burgers to be beyond delicious. I don't eat regularly at fine restaurants, but, I know a $5.00 burger when I eat one. The truffle fries were delicious and worth the visit.   The next time we visit, and we will, I will try some English dishes instead and I know I won't be as critical as I am today. Gordon is a great chef, but, a $20.00 burger should taste superior in my opinion.   When you go, because it's a great place visually, try the lobster rolls. They offer a great selection of beers and Mom loved their take on a very tasty margarita.",

Our server, Tim, was very attentive and super friendly.   We started out with the corned beef poutine and it was great. The corned beef was shredded out and was in good supply.   We had the steak and ale pie and braised short rib along with a side of their mac and cheese. The portions were the perfect size. Too bad there was no rom for dessert because the sticky toffee pudding sounded great. It's a little pricey but I expect that in Vegas. We just call it the casino tax. :)",

The restraunt was easy enough to find, you do have to walk through the casino a bit if you come through the front lobby area, but it is close to the forum tower, if you are staying at this hotel.  I had made a reservation on open table, so it was not difficult to get in at the time. My only hiccup- is that I showed up a bit early, and was told rather rudely by the hostess to come back later. Just a tip: a smile goes a long way. Whatever, people have bad days, and I am not going to let hers get to me. All the other hostesses I interacted with after this interaction were find and pleasant.   Once we were seated, we were given our menus and shown the special by our waiter, taylor (I believe). He was fantastic. A+ for him.  We ordered an glass of wine, an appetizer, two mains,  and a side to start. The appetizer was taking quite a bit of time to come out, and shockingly our waiter brought us a half order of wings while we were waiting. Great Service! Also- those wings are magic. I would order those.   Shortly after our appetizer arrived. I had ordered the poutine. It was great. the cheese curds were gooey and stringy, and the meat was fall apart good. I would order this as a main.   For our mains we ordered the short rib and the fish and chips. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese as a side. All of them were amazing. I was so impressed (minus the mashed peas served with the fish and chips, but that is not the restaurant's fault- I just though they were nasty).  I also ordered the toffee bread pudding to go that you get here for your first yelp check in, and it was MAGICAL. I ate it back in our room and it was so good I didn't even offer any to my other half. :)  I was a little worried coming in here, because the reviews are not all that great, but I thought the experience and decor was great, the food was great, and our waiter was great. Overall, I would come back here, and recommend it!",

My team and my client were having a great time there and definitely thought the restaurant was a place to go back to the future.   But then it was all ruined because of one thing, the customer service of our waitress.  We had finished eating and were actually waiting for a couple of people to join us for drinks and more desert.  When our waitress, Stacy, came up to us and ask us to move to bar because there was \"a private party waiting.\"  We politely got up and left the restaurant, where there was no line waiting outside.    I had already spent over $300 in your restaurant.  Because we were kicked out we had to go spend the additional $500 at a competitor.  I have never been kicked out of a restaurant for waiting for other people to join us, especially after spending $300.  Let's just say I won't be back to your location or recommend it to anyone.  You have a lot of work to do with customer service there.",

    "text": "I am consistently impressed by how amazing Gordon Ramsay's restaurants are. Not just the food, but the amount of attention to detail is mindblowing. No wonder his rise to fame is partly based on yelling at people to get their shit together. It's a gift that must be shared with the less fortunate.  While pricier than other pubs, this is Gordon Ramsay's pub and it's apparently the only one styled in such a blatantly English manner. For a Vegas restaurant, it's on par with a decent dinner place at $20-$30 for entrees. But I doubt you'll find any other restaurant that makes you feel so darn British and serves up such tasty meat pies.  While we missed the glorious $5 truffle fries happy hour special, we came around dinner time and were treated to a short wait and excellent service.  Speaking of the servers, I learned that the uniforms were specially designed by some fashion designer, which is so extra. I love it. You know what else is lovably extra? The corgis and pugs printed on the chairs.   We were seated next to a giant, glaring portrait of Gordon Ramsay. As we ate our food, his face stared down as if to say, \"Go on, I dare you to say you don't enjoy my food\". But we couldn't. Everything was great. The difference it makes to use lamb meat in the shepherd's pie is amazing. So tender and flavourful. And I don't even particularly like lamb or shepherd's pie. The chicken, bacon, and kale pie was a deliciously complete meal, all encompassed in flaky pie crust.   While the food didn't make me collapse in sheer bliss like Hell's Kitchen, those were still some damn good pies. And they were so filling, I couldn't even eat the cute bread stick that came along on the wooden serving boards. And if all that wasn't interesting enough, the bill came with an iPod attached for feedback. So extra. So English. Truly smashing experience.  (44/100) - 2018",

We also got the Belgian margaritas and the lobster macaroni and cheese (A-MAZ-ING). Rodney was our server and he was really on top of everything. Plus had a great attitude!! Food came out quick.   We ate at Burgr the night before (Monday) as it is our usual go-to spot, fantastic as always.   My boyfriend (recently turned fiance) is turning 35 so this was a great start to his bday week!

    "text": "I will review this place in the order in which we experienced it:  First we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude. She asked us what our last name was, in which my fiance replied: \"I will just tell you my first name, because my last name is very long, and hard to pronounce.\" So he told her his first name, and she preceded to still ask for his last name. My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her, to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a \"Well, it's a 45 minute wait.\" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling, and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her.   After that, we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar, but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot, and it is a wise idea to do that here,because the portions are large.   I thought that the food was presented beautifully, and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo, loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME), and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy.   While we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves, we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly, doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh, they should take a break.   I would come here again, and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses. Ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot, and that those ladies up front gave us, and from what I'm reading most people, a bad taste in their mouth.",

There is a food court in Caesars that has what you would find at most mall food courts with a higher price.  Seeing as I had done pretty well during my stay I decided instead to try something more substantial. SO I selected the Pub and Grill.   I was more than pleased with my selection. Being a big fan of a the traditional Reuben Sandwich I jumped at the bartenders recommendation of the Dubliner. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=L6eTYEfU4s3hE-3XWe7mEA#jT7C1Zt9bL1IOQBYg6bN9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>  They basically chop the well seasoned corned beef into small bite sized cubes and layer them with the sauerkraut and the cheese inside an awesome toasty bread bowl. HOLY CRAP, it was delicious. It was paired with a delicious thousand island dressing and some \"Chips\" that were out of this world.   I will admit that by Vegas Haute Cuisine standards this lunch was fairly pedestrian but it gets a five from me for creativity, taste, preparation, and out standing service. A special shout out to Bartender/ server Ray Ray, Dude your recommendation rocked.",

I came here in the off season (early December) for lunch and we were promptly seated at some high tops. Our server was very attentive and the menu offered typical British pub food that I'm familiar with.   I ordered the onion soup which was wonderful, not overly salty or oily and full of flavor. A great soup for the cold weather. My husband had ordered a lamb burger with goat cheese and it was fantastic! Absolutely delicious! My other lunch guest ordered mussels but wasn't pleased with them since they were cooked in a type broth that I couldn't identify but he wasn't familiar with (I liked it). I would definitely return but probably avoid the dinner hour based on the lackluster reviews.",

    "text": "Maybe we ordered the right things. Maybe people are too harsh because it's Gordon Ramsey's restaurant so they hold it to an unobtainable level. Who knows??  Our server was very friendly and was able to get everything out in an hour on a Friday night. We let him know we had a show to catch and he put a rush on everything. Was very friendly as well.   Apps we had the mini lobster rolls and the truffle chips. Lobster was very good. Chips were a waste of money. I'm sure my wife got them since a friend of hers got truffle popcorn at Hearthstone last week and they were awesome.   I had read enough reviews to make me nervous of some items so I ordered a burger, my wife ordered the lamb burger and my buddy had salmon. The burger was excellent. My wife said her lamb burger was great. And, every bite was gone from my friends salmon so pretty sure he was happy.   For dessert we had to try it. We ordered the \"spotted dick\", jokes and all. It was excellent. Described by the waiter as similar to bread pudding but steamed. It came out, and was a warm sugary bread pudding in a liquor cream sauce with ice cream. It was surprisingly good.   All in all a very good meal. Good food, good service. Any complaints on price hasn't eaten on the strip. It was in line with anywhere else on the strip. At $80 a foot in rent and 10-25% of sales to boot going to landlord, what do you expect?",

My wife is pregnant and when ordering a lemonade he actually chuckled. Entrees arrived and the server was no where to be found to see if we had what we needed. Turns out my steak wasn't delivered with a steak knife so I asked the guy who I'd seen make 4 rounds and figured was the manager, even though he never actually talked to any of the tables, for a knife since I couldn't seem to find my actual server. 5 minutes later I had what I needed to eat my meal. No doubt that the lack of service starts at the top.   Like I said, food was ok, but way overshadowed by the lack of service. I would figure that a Ramsey restaurant would pride themselves on that front but i figure Gordon is too busy with TV shows and opening a plethora of joints while his stock is worth anything. Great corn soup with crab, smashed fingerlings are awesome, just wish the staff wasn't disaffected like their attire.",

I ordered a soup to start then has the fish and chips, the fish was not bad , but may be I am just used to crispy fries \"chips\" that I really did not like the soggy taste of the chips. For a main course I decided to get the t-bone lamb, why not right?!  Well I got it done medium, as I remember Gordon Ramsey going off one time on Hell's Kitchen about it being better, for him may be. Medium done must mean something different in The UK then it does here as it was not really eatable in my opinion. The meat was really raw in the centre, I could not eat it!   I really expected so mush more, I thought I would be wowed, I that it was going to be an over the top dinning experience. May be its m fault I came here expecting fire works and I got sparkles at best. The chef my be a celebrity but the food is defiantly not! Gordon Ramsey's restaurant is really not different than any other, I'm going to eat at the Buffet in my hotel tonight - it's really all the same!",

The next serving was delicious, just wish it was a bit bigger. The wife ordered the fish and chips. It was excellent. A lot of fish and the chips were good just needed a few more seconds in the grill.  Our waitress was very courteous and apologetic about my dinner dish.

They send you a text when your table is ready which was better than having to sit around and wait or carry a pager, so we were able to play some slots while we waited.  The atmosphere is a little different, you feel more like you are in someone's house for dinner rather than a restaurant, it's a little odd, but it works. Something I have noticed in Gordon Ramsay's restaurants is that the servers all seem a little, under dressed, but our server was attentive and knew all about the menu.  We tried the pretzel bread that came before the meal and the cheese sauce it came with was great. A nice blend of cheese and spice, it really worked. We ordered the Shepard's pie and the mac and cheese which was not on the dinner menu, but if you ask for it, you can have it. Both dishes were delicious! My husband said it was the best Shepard's pie he ever had and the mac and cheese was amazing! It was creamy and had many levels of flavor, definitely the most complex mac and cheese that I had ever eaten. Also, don't be fooled by what appear to be small portion sizes, they are actually quite filling.  For dessert we had to try the much talked about sticky toffee pudding and it did not disappoint. The cake was warm and soft, paired perfectly with creamy ice cream and caramel. It was enough to share for two people.  The service overall wasn't quick, but it wasn't bad either. The couple behind us were waiting for their food when we got there and still didn't have it when we were done. I don't know what they ordered, but they seemed to be waiting a long time for it. Overall I would definitely come back to try more of the menu, it was a nice experience.",

Decided to splurge on the rib eyes because I figured we could not go wrong with watching all his cooking shows, plus it was her birthday weekend. At 45 bucks a piece it was one of the worst rib eyes I have ever had. The outside rim of this thin steak was cooked decent, but the middle was inedible, not only because it was over cooked, but there was so much gristle i ended up spitting most of it out. My daughter got one of the burgers which was good and we discovered the best tasting root beer we have ever had. Very disappointed as we were very pleased with his other place burgr on the strip.",

If I was basing my review solely on these factors, I would give it 4 and a half stars.  The food was good, not great, but very good.  I had the English Ale Onion Soup, which I liked, but thought it lacked.  The onions were gorgeous, the cheddar crustinis were good, but the broth didn't have it.  My main was the filet platter.  The steak was nice, the pork belly was a bit boring and the shrimp were not hot enough.  My friends had similar complaints and compliments.

My friends got the fish & chips, which was apparently pretty delicious!  My experience foodwise was meh, but others enjoyed. Give it a shot.",

    "text": "Delicious food and a great ambiance at this iconic chef's restaurant inside of The Mirage hotel and casino. The seating and decor transport you to a tucked away London bistro. The staff is very friendly and the service is phenomenally fast!  We came in on a Saturday night and were seated within about 5 minutes of arrival. Our server, Stacy, was a doll and did a fantastic job of making us feel right at home. While we loved how amazingly comfortable our seats were, they were a little low to the ground relative to our table, which made dining slightly awkward (but not overly problematic).   For our first course, we chose from their impressive selection of draft beers and appetizers. I went with a pint of the delicious Scottish Ale by Innis and Gunn. It was very tasty with a dark golden color, light body, crisp mouthfeel and subtle whisky/vanilla notes. We also ordered Chef Ramsay's special kettle chip nachos, which were incredible and lasted maybe 5 minutes. The crispy potato chips were generously dressed with a cheesy mornay-like sauce, peppers, green onion and lots of tender beef. Absolutely superb!  For our entrees, we tried the fish n chips and shepherd's pie, both of which were excellent. The cod was fresh and flaky and the batter was perfectly light and crispy, yet firm enough to hold up to the thick cut of fish. My only critique is that it was somewhat lacking salt. The chips were perfect as was the housemade tartar.   The Shepherd's pie was also fabulous, with mounds of fluffy mashed potatoes elegantly piped atop a generous helping of savory lamb stew. It was packed full of flavor!  Finally, for dessert, we used the Yelp check-in coupon and tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was just superb. The flavor profile was so complex with the delicious flavor imparted by the dates really shining through. The salted caramel ice cream that crowned the dish made the flavor even more sophisticated and incredibly addicting!  Overall, this is a great place to stop in for a nice, slightly upscale, yet comfortable dining experience. A must-see for any Gordon Ramsay fan.",

The beef Wellington was about a size of a tennis ball and was the same price as Hell's Kitchen. Not to mention the inside looked completely raw and the outside looked well done. We overlooked the entree and looked forward to dessert, but the sticky toffee pudding was soggy. It pretty much just melted with the ice cream. The service is also quite slow. We waited for at least 30-40min for our app and entree and another 20min for the dessert.",

However, it was too salty for my liking. I ordered my burger medium. It was literally a hit and miss. Half of the patty was medium and half was well done (seemingly split down the middle). The half that was medium was juicy and the half that was well done was dry. We also checked in on yelp and got a free sticky toffee pudding. It was delicious and the best item I tried. It's a big dessert that should be shared with another person. Food wise I would give this place 2.5 stars. However, the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the service. Michelle, our waitress, was so accommodating and very nice. It was  busy last night but each time we stopped her for a question or request, she responded with a big smile and had such a lovely demeanor. Props to Michelle for making the experience at this establishment a better one when the food couldn't.",

    "text": "My first experience with Gordon Ramsay's cooking was in one of his restaurants in London called the Narrow and was fortunate enough to have tried a really spectaculr Dover sole dish.   As years go by, Gordon Ramsay seemed to have really made a name for himself. His public persona  might appear pretty harsh but one has gotta admit that he is truly one of best chefs in the world and one of the savvyist restauranteurs. His \"direct-in-your-face\", \"tell-it-like-it-is\" zero sugarcoating demoneanor  can make some cringe but also makes him a showbiz personality.  Our small party decided to go to GR's Pub & Grill at the the Caesars Palace and we ordered the following:  - Shepherd's pie made with stewed lamb with root vegetables topped with a cheddar mashed potatoes. Very aromatic and herbaceous. This was a good tasting pie. - Pan-roasted airline chicken which is beer brined on a bed of white beans with some kale and carrots. The chicken had a nice, crispy skin and seemed very moist and tender.  - Grilled bacon burger - Burger was juicy and well-received. - Grilled lamb burger - Meeh from the person who had it said that it wasn't anything special. - Pub chopped salad sans chicken - This was ordered by someone who wasn't very hungry. - Truffle chips - Everyone loved these truffle fries. - Hellfire wings - Chile beer glazed and quite flavorful with a kick. - Crispy calamari - okay. - GR's Sticky toffee pudding - THIS IS SOOO GOOD! Absolutely decadent, unctuous and delicious. I was already full but couldn't stop eating this. I would just return for the sticky toffee pudding!  All in all, we had a good meal and a great time! Trying to get a reservation an be easily done through Open Table.  My next stop would be GR's Hell's Kitchen but getting a reservation on short notice is always tricky.",

We did not make reservations for dinner on Saturday, so I was worried about the wait. However, I was told it would be a 15 minute wait and was told that I would get a text message once our table was ready. To my surprise, I got notified in exactly 15 minutes and got seated right away.   Our server was awesome. I don't recall her name, but she was so sweet and kind. She made our experience here worthwhile.   My husband and I were starving and were looking forward to our dinner. We were both very pleased with the food.   *Calamari was crispy and flavorful. It came with two sauces. My favorite was the cocktail sauce.   *Lobster roll was amazing!! The bread was so buttery and perfectly toasted. This is the perfect dish to share. It comes in two small pieces, which was the perfect appetizer.   *Chopped salad was fresh and light. I loved the dressing. It did not feel heavy nor unhealthy. It included tons of chicken/salami and other fresh veggies. I'd definitely get this again.   *Buttered Chicken Curry was what my husband got. He's a huge fan of Indian food, and it definitely did not disappoint. There was a good spicy kick to the curry, and it was served with rice and naan.   *Sticky Toffee Pudding was SOOO amazing. It's FREE with a yelp check-in and SO worth the calories. My husband is not a big dessert guy, and he could not stop eating it. The bread was warm and not too sweet. The ice cream was the perfect complement to the bread.",

I saw this place on the way to & from the Forum Shops so we made a reservation. This place does not look like an English Pub more like a microbrewery with tables & booths scattered about in a couple of rooms. We were seated at an intimate table for two with comfy wing back chairs. Once seated, I felt like an 8 year old as the table was a bit high or was it the chair was a bit low?  Service was very good & the food came out hot & in a timely manner. We started off with the lobster rolls. Toasted mini-loaves of brioche stuffed with lobster. While very good, the lobster was not swimming in mayo I found this a bit on the bland side. I was smart enough not to eat much as I ordered the cheeseburger. The burger was really, really tasty. Super fresh bread, crisp veggies on a slab of premium beef. Cooked medium this baby was a winner. The fries were very crispy & went well with the garlic mayo that was served on the side. The burger is huge so I didn't eat it all, H was kind enough to finish it off for me.  Being Vegas, you will spend a pretty penny here but it's worth it.",

It isn't a super quiet place, as it is in the casino and a pub, but it's not too loud either. We also really enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality place to eat on the strip.",

We got the nachos (great deal during happy hour) Which were really good and loads of meat. Would definitely get again.   Got a mini slider (my gf said it was a good size for her as she could eat other things!)   Also got a Hell's Kitchen burger and this was GREAT. Has a little kick to it and the beef is tender and juicy. Comes with an option of upgrading to truffle fries with a bunch of sauces you can dip em in.   Another tip if it's your first time be sure to check in and you get a free desert which was so good!",

First, the only appetizer they were out of was the pot pie sampler - our server only told us that when I attempted to order it.  Oops - it would have been nice to be told that before getting my heart set on it.    We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, which came with french fries. and the lobster roll.  The highlight of the meal were the fries, very crispy and served with a ketchup/horseradish condiment.  The sandwich was dry and not very flavorful.  The lobster roll had more roll than I would have hoped for and more mayo than needed.    The service was merely adequate - our server took the order, delivered the order and then brought the check.  Hmmm... as a local, you kinda expect at least a check-in by your server to find out if you need anything else.    I guess Mr. Ramsay figures that tourists will eat at his restaurant because of his fame and then, who cares.",

Eclectically designed in pub fashion, its vibe and energy is right on point to what you'd imagine for a celebrity chef's venue. However, the menu choices and cooking execution is no where near what'd you imagine.   Let's be real: it's a pub. And the menu greatly reflects that. I think I just hoped for a better culinary experience than traditional burgers and fries or a turkey pesto on wheat.   I will say that it was extremely nice that they seated a group of 5 right away without a reservation, considering that's often a rarity on the Strip. But our food took over an hour and a half to come out, and our server seemed really flustered that we asked him to split the bill.   I'll give Ramsey the benefit of the doubt; I'm certain he's an amazing chef. I just wish that he'd put some TLC into his restaurants. That's all.",

The Crispin cider is good for anyone that doesn't drink beer, like me. The food was fine but the thing that was a shame was our server. He wasn't bad, but he wasn't that good either. He was fine, but he seemed a bit robotic. He didn't have much of a personality and would give very short answers. He checked on us and made sure we were ok, so I guess that's what is really important. Don't need to come back on my own, but if my friends want to come back, I wouldn't refuse.",

Ordered their wedge style salad and a BLT. The salad was awful and I sent it back. You could tell right away that this salad was pre-made and had been sitting around way past it's sell-by date. Lettuce was wilted and rubbery. Ugh. Told the waitress that it was not acceptable and she took it away. Here comes the manager to apologize and to ensure that it will not happen on my next visit and he would remove it from the bill. Fine. Now onto the BLT. This sandwich had a maple flavored bacon that just overpowered the sandwich. It was not good at all. The only thing I enjoyed was the cold pint of Heineken that I had with my meal.  Here comes the bill and guess what. The salad was still there. I flagged down the waitress who was surprised that it was on it. How about checking it before you hand it to me?  I have seen Kitchen Nightmares where Gordon Ramsay shreds every dish he tastes as awful. Hey Gordon, why don't you check out your namesake restaurant and see what you think of it.  Will not return. Vegas has much better places than this money grab.  Cheers to all",

    "text": "Having watched a lot of Kitchen Nightmare shows that Gordon Ramsay host, he always talks about standards of the food served at restaurants. My wife and I ordered the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish and Chips, Chicken Lollipops, and the English Ale Onion Soup. The names were very creative, but unfortunately, the food was not all that great. The fish for the fish and chips were NOT hot and flaky like you'd expect on a fresh battered fish. It came off like frozen fish. The fries were not quite as crunchy as you'd expect. It was slightly soggy and the standards just were not there. Definitely not what you would expect when paying for a $28 fish and chip basket. The onion soup was just another french onion soup in the guise of great marketing. As for the chicken lollipops, they tasted like frozen wings that were not fried crispy and the wing sauce was super salty. I had to drown the wings' saltiness with a good helping of the bleu cheese sauce and the peeled veggies next to it.   The decor was a mixed bag. There was nothing all that special about the decor. They had stacked beer kegs and chairs with his dogs on them. I would've expected a little more wood to make it look a little more authentic pub and modernize the furnishings.  At the end of our dinner service, our tab came out to about $110, and we gave the server a $100 VISA gift card and a $20 bill and explained to him to only charge a $100 and take the rest, The guy clearly understood what I told him, and came back saying he tried charging $100 and then $90 but it declined. LIES! I checked my balance on the card when I got back to my hotel room later, and he had charged $120 the first time, and then $115 just to make me use another form of payment. I gave him my regular credit card, but that was just poor service, and didn't appreciate the lying from the server.  All in all, dinner service from the food to the service was subpar. I was really disappointed going into what I thought would be an enjoyable experience. Even if the experience was not the best, I wouldn't give a star on here, but the subpar food, and the server being dishonest just killed it for me at the end of it all. Look through the rest of the reviews for this place. The reviews speak for themselves as to the disappointment from many diners. I can't in good conscience recommend this place, and I can't believe that Gordon Ramsay would appreciate what's going on at this restaurant with his branding on it.",

We squeezed in at the bar and had the lamb burger and a beer. It was all perfectly fine, but there wasn't anything special about it. Plus, I had a far superior lamb burger the next day at Ri-Ra in Mandalay Place. And it came with sweet potato tots!  Gordon Ramsay was packed with conventioneers and as a result, the service was a little slow and it took the food a while to come out. Plus the outfits the servers wear are a little ridiculous. So if you can deal with the crowds, GR's is OK enough. But it sure makes you miss Bradley Ogden, which used to occupy this space.",

This is the second Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been to, the other one was in London and wasn't the best experience.  The atmosphere at this pub was nice... lots of TVs and the room was huge.  We sat in the bar area and had to wait quite awhile for service and our food.  I also found what the waitresses were wearing to be a bit much... but to each their own.  As far as the food goes, I tried the pretzels, pub nachos, sliders, and sticky toffee pudding.  The pretzels were amazing, especially the cheese sauce they were served with.  I only wish this has been a bigger portion.  The nachos were good... loved the kettle chips and sauce, but there were WAY too many jalapenos - jeez does anyone like them that much?  The sliders were standard... way over cooked.  As others have said the sticky toffee pudding is delicious... this is a MUST have at this restaurant.  All in all, I would go back and try some different things.  They do have some happy hour specials, which is nice... especially in Vegas.",

All bored and chatting it up. We asked for a place next to the bar TVs however they seated us towards the back of the bar next to one TV. That was mildly frustrating as the place was dead for a labor day weekend at lunch rush. I'm guessing people are intimidated by the prices but we had cash to blow.  When the waitress addressed us she apologized for the wait as it was 10 minutes into being seated, she said she was the only server and someone called in. This was sad Bc there was 5-6 hostesses and a manager in a suit watching this whole ordeal and not doing anything about it. I wanted him to approach us and ask about the experience but he skipped our table.   Long story summed up, the craft cocktail (Mr Tokyo or something) was like a pink lemonade with egg white froth, not good but the waitress didn't explain what it entailed.. My friend loved the blt. Other friend loved the lamb burger. The fish and chips was the biggest let down. $30 bucks for HUGE chunks of cod.. They state how awesome the batter KS but with peices so large you miss out.   Long story short, I'd rather fly to England for $1,000 bucks, take a 40 pound cab ride to Mildenhall Village and eat at the dog track than to recommend anyone eating here.   I'm a Vegas local and I only write reviews if I love or hate a place. The two stars is Bc I like the mushy peas",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas for a pool tournament we had to make the trek over to check out Gordon Ramsey's pub. Being a big fan of Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef we decided to do lunch.  We started with the calamari appetizer. We then ordered three different entrees. One of us got the lamb burger with blue cheese, sauteed onions and fries, another got the fish and chips and I did the beef burger with smoked applewood bacon. Even though we were full we had to try a dessert so we shared the snicker doodle dessert. All of the food was great. The server MJ was very helpful making suggestions. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. It is a must do if you're in Vegas you won't be disappointed.",

I was a little sad to find out Hell's Kitchen winner Janel didn't actually end up being the chef...and maybe that explained why I wasn't super blown away...  I do admit I did a bad job ordering...I went against my gut and ordered an open-faced ham and cheese sandwich...which was really too heavy for my mood at the time. I barely touched it and regretted my order; I was originally torn about ordering one of the three salads they had on the menu and I realize it would have probably been the better decision.  Everyone I was with seemed to have ordered better than I did...I got to try the French Onion Soup which was amazing (really hit the spot) as well as the Shepherd's Pie which was good too (just heavy).   So I guess my conclusion is their menu didn't seem very \"light\"  so if you're in a light mood it may not give you the best options...but I probably would give the place another try and order better next time!",

They were prepared to perfection. There were so many I didn't need a salad or appetizer. The Beef pot pie that my wife had was tender and delicious not mention the richness and savory flavor of the gravy.  We had such a great experience with food and the service that we decided to go back on Wednesday before we went to the Celine Dion concert. The second time was better than the first. Our waiter, Michael, was the epitome of service. Totally engaging but not obtrusive. We did a repeat of the scallops and a grilled Ribeye. Again both were prepared to perfection.  Michael picked out a dessert that was awesome. We highly recommend you go there should you be staying at Cesar's Palace or any place while on the strip, we will be back!",

There wasn't anything super special about the burgers and they served them on a cutting board which made them awkward to eat. The fries were seasoned but there again nothing wow.

    "text": "Don't even think about eating here without a reservation! Although Gordon Ramsay has several restaurants in Las Vegas, they're all super packed as everyone anticipates to dine at the hyped up establishment of Hell's Kitchen's superstar.  Located inside the Caesar's Palace casino, you may be tempted to put some bills into those slot machines while waiting for your table. Thankfully, our wait (with reservation) wasn't too long and we were seated near the kitchen that had a huge painting of Gordon's menacing face.   I'm sure if Gordon was there in person, the employees would have provided better service. Our waiter did not appear too happy about doing separate bills, even though we advised prior to ordering our meals. He said the best he can do is separate our table of 11 into four separate bills, so we gotta partner up with someone..   I have no complaints about the food, but it wasn't so amazing I would go back and try other items. I ordered the pork belly - the serving size looks small but because of how fatty the meat was, the dish was actually very filling. We weren't allowed to substitute the sides - but if I could, I would have gotten the mac and cheese, which according to my coworkers are amazing.   The ambience was a little like a jazz bar, except that it was extremely loud - you'd be shouting all night long. So would I come back? Probably not.   My tummy deserves better than an A-OK when in sin city.",

Our server never showed up again and we were given a new server after being left without one for a good 30-45 minutes. Our new server also was never seen until we asked for the bill. We were never offered refills on our drinks but luckily the bus girl kept refilling our water.  As far as the food goes it was also just OK. If it had come out in a timely matter I probably would have enjoyed it more. We had three burgers (two of the bacon and one hell's kichen) and the fourth person had the sliders and wings. The wings were actually pretty good and the burgers were cooked to our specifications, however our buns were soaked through with grease and everything was luke warm.

The nachos were INSANE: fresh, homemmade potato chips slathered in the most flavorful beer-based cheese sauce I've ever nommed. When I die, I don't want to be embalmed. I just want to be covered in that cheese and put in the ground. Also: in Vegas, you cannot beat the value of this happy hour with a stick.  Shout out to our waiter, Dave. Dave provided the best, most attentive and polite service ever. He had excellent recommendations on food and drink AND he was kind enough to offer some tourist-y suggestions to me and my man. Not only did he stand at our table and tell us about a bunch of cool things to see downtown, but he even grabbed a piece of paper from the bar and wrote down a ton of stuff for us.

He told us that he hoped we would enjoy our time here and that they had a \"little surprise for us\". Well of course we wondered what that could be as we became intrigued.....so we stayed on.   The restaurant had a surprise visitor, none other than Mr. Gordon Ramsay himself!!! He was there for the restaurants 3rd anniversary and surprised all his guests with free dessert. Spotted Dick, Sticky Toffee and Creme Brule shake, all of the above were orgasmic, especially the Spotted Dick.   It was a complete joy meeting this brilliant chef and not to mention a handsome one too! Thank you Mr. Ramsay for the surprise visit. My friends and I were impressed as to how friendly and polite you were with everyone. You were not hurried in the least and took your time with the guests. And by the way, we want to know what cologne were you wearing?? it was divine We look forward to another visit.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay is an interesting sort of celebrity chef on TV. On Hells kitchen he's rude and curse yelling and swearing while people make mistakes. It's not really my favourite show as I don't subscribe to that form of people treatment.   Had a fantastic group dinner on the evening I visited.  Everything here has a fine British pub touch. It's charming, different!  This is the third time I've eaten here. We had ordered some appetizers calamari and the devilled eggs. Both were above average.  For my main course I had selected the Scottish salmon which I had eaten two years ago. It came with a crispy skin and was succulent and served with some potatoes and greens on top. Really it was a very high quality meal. As a side we had some lobster Mac and cheese which was very tasty and brussell sprouts (nicely done). For dessert we ordered the trifle and also the sticky toffee pudding. I had a small serving of each and it was tasty and nice in presentation.   We ate in the private room in the back. Service was very good and of no issue.  My only interesting semi-negative is I had ordered a Sam Adams on tap and it tasted nothing like a Sam. I should have ordered an Innis and Gunn.   I've seen some negative complaints on Yelp. Sure it's expensive, maybe you had bad or rude service.  Many restaurants on the strip and in hotels are pricey. Complain all you want, we enjoyed a great meal with old friends and new!",

It tasted more like chicken curry than butter chicken, but still good.  4) Fish and chips - nice hot and cripsy chips and the fish was flaky and light. Overall good and I really loved the mushy peas and you can taste the mint. 5) Sticky toffee pudding - must have must have must have. the best part! the warm caramel over the ice cream made the cake taste even better.",

These were really amazing! We then ordered dessert... Mum's apple tarts and The sticky toffee pudding. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing! Unfortunately we had that second. The puff pastry on moms apple tart was more like a pancake. Not only that, it was Raw inside! Extremely disappointing. I expected much more from a Chef's restaurant who does kitchen nightmares. This one is definitely a nightmare! Better to just leave that one off the menu all together! Our waitress left a bit to be desired also. We sat for over ten minutes after we were finished while she stood at the waiters station and chatted with, at first, another waitress for over five minutes. Then with a waiter without paying attention to any of their customers. Finally, when someone came to remove our plates did she finally take notice and came to bring our check. I don't mind slow service when it's busy, understandable, but chatting and not paying attention to customers seemed rude and made us feel ignored.",

I like Gordon's shows,  I like shepherds pie, but Gordon' shephard's pie  was far too rich.  The potatoes were  thick and sticky, filled with butter to the point where it was overwhelming.  The sticky gooey potatoes were like wall pasty  gluttonous mess. The stew portion was very rich very condensed, but fine enough.  As a meal it failed, there was nothing to offset the sticky congealing potatoes and stew.  I felt like I was eating a stick of butter seasoned with potatoes.  In short in an effort to make a stand out shephards pie, Gordon and his crew have grossly over done it.  Gordon, go back to the UK tour some pubs and try some pie,  there are plenty them serving much better fare.  Sure some nasty pubs serve your idea  of shephards pie, but many serve pies that don't leave you feeling like you just ate a pound of butter.",

    "text": "First off, the husband and I are Vegas locals, so we have come to expect a certain \"service level\" when we head out on the town for a show or even dinner.  This Saturday night we decided to try the new Ramsay place, being we are both long time fans, and we were dying for some good ol pub food.  First off, when we approached the place, they said it was a 25 minute wait (which for Saturday night at Caesar's, not much of an issue)-although there WERE so many hostesses up front it didn't really give off the idea that they were too busy, even though some tables were full.  We walked around waiting for our table, and once we were notified we were ready, we returned to the front.  The gaggle of hostesses tried to take our names again, then finally realized we'd already waited our turn.  One stepped forward to walk us to our table, and as we asked twice to be sat a lower table in front, she continued to ignore us and tried to put us at some high up table in the back.  We asked AGAIN to sit at a different table, and the response was a little \"hee hee, I didn't even see that one!!\" (She walked right by it!) Finally, we sit.  And sit.  Annnnnnnd sit.  After a good 20 minutes someone came by with water in a bottle, explained they were our server's \"assistant\" and the server would be \"right back\" to take our order.  Yeah...Ok....I guess not!  We continued to sit by ourselves and drink our plain water, with STILL no sign of our server-FINALLY FINALLY a manager saw us sitting there with nothing, and asked if we'd been helped, or if there was anything he could bring us.  We were, of course, about two items short of memorizing the ENTIRE menu at this point (quiz me, I dare you!), so we placed our drink AND food order with the manager.  He wisked off, all apologies, and was back in a flash with our drinks, which he thoughtfully comped for us (which was nice, they were $15 each!).  STILL don't know who our server is, and very shortly we had someone ELSE (a THIRD different person, mind you) deliver our food, which once it was ordered came out QUICKLY. (Which makes it even MORE aggravating!) The two pies we ordered were tasty, I got the Steak N' Ale Pie, and my husband had the Shepard's Pie; however we were BOTH left wanting some veggies in the pies with the huge amount of meats (totally backwards, I know, but that WAS the case!)  The price point for the pies was a little steep, at $24 each.  At this point, we'd been there about an hour, and FINALLY we meet our server-he came over (WITH NO SIGN OF AN APOLOGY or ANYTHING), never introduced himself, and asked if we wanted desert.  We decided to order the Brownie Cheesecake-which don't be fooled, it's NOT a Brownie Cheesecake, it's a piece of Brownie, a piece of Cheesecake and some ice cream-was tasty, BUT BUT....JUST WAIT-- Since we'd been at this experience for a VERY long time, we wanted a smoke-we waited to see our waiter again, and told him we would be RIGHT BACK and we were NOT FINISHED....went out in front of the restaurant, and proceeded to endure SEVERAL dirty looks from the server while we each had only 1/2 a cigarette.  We decided we better go back in, and the server had COMPLETELY cleaned off our table; desert, forks, spoons, MY drink (which was still pretty full, it didn't taste very good)...even the crumbs from our pies were washed away.  Needless to say, MOST ESPECIALLY due to the price point, this has GOT TO BE the WORST EXAMPLE OF SERVICE we have ever endured, and I DOUBT we will return.  To Gordon Ramsay: I'm sure if you REALLY knew how much in profits you were missing out on due to managers comping alcohol and food because of SLOW TERRIBLE SERVICE, you would quickly do a \"Kitchen Nightmares\" episode on your own place-and there would be plates and knives galore thrown and broken all over the spot.  We were VERY DISAPPOINTED to be sure.  The only reason for the stars at all is the food we received was good.",

I ordered a COKE and got a flat Pepsi.  Where is the Gordon Ramsay standard?  Really wanted to slam my plate on the floor and say F&$# it!  At least the food wasn't RAW!

Hands down the best I've ever had including England, and that is seriously saying something. I don't know what kind of voodoo they used to to make that breading but it was light and crispy and shattered like glass when you cut it.   As for service, impeccable. Our water was filled so smoothly my husband commented that he hadn't even noticed it happening. It was like a well practiced production where everything appears and disappears seamlessly.  You will spend $100. It isn't fancy food it is straightforward and done really well. If you are looking for something fancy then it isn't the right place. If you appreciate food done right then here is your place.",

    "text": "I saw this place while exploring the casino and realized that it just opened earlier this month. I decided to take my sister here for a belated Christmas gift (she, like many others, is a Gordan Ramsey fan and aspires to also cook amazing food one day). Luckily, there was no need to physically stand in line - we placed our name on the waitlist and roamed around until the estimated time that that gave us to return, by which they had our table ready.  After we sat down, we had to wait several minutes before the server came to us, but the staff and food more than made up for it. Our waitress, Elyse, was very sociable when she arrived, chatting with us for a while before taking our order. Because of our time constraint, my sister decided to settle for dessert only. We were debating between the sticky toffee pudding and potted triple chocolate trifle (both $9-10) and Elyse highly recommended the sticky toffee pudding, so we decided to go with that. Not disappointed with the overall selection at all!  Sticky Toffee Pudding: The combination of toffee \"pudding\" (it's actually a cake in Britain) with toffee syrup (wasn't too sweet, which balances out the cake), and vanilla bean ice cream (made fresh daily and gives a nice balance between hot and cold) is heavenly!  Overall: Con: Not getting the waiter right away when we sat down Pro: Not needing to physically wait in line, friendly staff, quality dessert  Will come here next time (over buffets) to try the rest of the menu!",

Yes--I realize he is not there personally making every order--but I was hoping for much more--particularly at this price point. As I mentioned--I went for the fish and chips, anticipating authenticity and flavor. Unfortunately, the fish was very bland, and had a very strong, oily taste that I could not quite figure out. I've eaten my share of fried foods--and know what overused oil tastes like--but this was something different. The chips were also less than impressive, and the portion was rather small. All in all--very disappointing. The other two diners in my party felt the same way about the caesar salad and club sandwich, respectively. This is the type of place that you walk into with ultra-high expectations--so when you are let down, it is even more frustrating.",

My wife and her friend ordered Scotch Eggs and Deviled Eggs which were better than my app.   We were only half way through the appetizer when our main course arrived. Myself and my wife's friend had ordered the Fish & Chips. Her chips were cold so got sent back, the waiter was laughing at us as we complained. I ate about half of mine before I could eat no more as it was very greasy. This got sent back also which got taken off the bill which is the least I would expect.   The only good things about the meal was the beer and the Mushy Peas. So overall Mr Ramsay, if this was supposed to be British Fish & Chips, your chef failed.",

The service, on the other hand, is exceptional!! My server was very gracious (sorry to say I cannot remember her name!) and the manager came twice to check up on me throughout the night.

So, going in to the restaurant, I had mammoth expectations of the quality of Ramsay's restaurants after watching his shows.   What I received far exceeded my expectations.  **it is very pricey, but trust me, you get what you pay for here. A burger is like 21-25...but very very worth it.***  A+ on the service: The waiter (sorry, I forgot his name) was very attentive, funny, and friendly!! Also, my water never went under halfway full, which I loved since I was parched. The manager was very on top of things, too, constantly flowing through the aisles, just keeping watch.  A++ on the App: For an app, my Dad and I split the White Bean Hummus...now I've had delicious hummus before, but this, let me tell you, was eyeballs rolling into the back of my head amazing. It was absolutely sensational...a must if you go here!   A+ on the burger and fries: I got the Grilled Beef Burger. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. It looked smaller and I was like okay I can totally finish this burger...no biggie. But, by the last bite, I was ready to explode. It was melt in your mouth and juicy and perfect. After the burger, I could barely eat my fries and left a lot of those sadly....THOSE were amazing.   Overall, this truly is a 5/5 restaurant.",

    "text": "After checking-in at Caesars, the GF's family and I was hungry for some lunch. We were all in the mood for some simple pub fare so after stepping off the elevators, we went straight to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill.  It seems to be the perfect venue for sports fans as there were a myriad of TVs around the surrounding bar and dining room, with plenty of soccer (excuse me, \"football\") fans watching what seemed to be a fairly important match. Color me clueless because I can't watch a sport that doesn't count down to the end of a match or doesn't always end with a winner. But on to the food!  Warm Salty Pretzels [$8 / $7 Total Rewards] Innis & Gunn Beer-Cheddar sauce, English granary mustard   Make sure you get a Total Rewards card from Caesars because you get a dollar knocked off most menu items. We started off with the pretzels, which came warm and salty indeed. But fair warning, you only get three! The accompanying beer-cheddar sauce was nicely sharp with depth from the beer. The English granary mustard was great, with a sinus-clearing horseradish kick that was highly reminiscent of my favorite Holman's.   Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich [$18 / $17 Total Rewards] Dark caraway rye, Gruyere cheese, sauerkraut, pickled onion and cucumber dressing  The corned beef brisket sandwich featured great rye, with a nice heft of corned beef brisket that was balanced by the tangy sauerkraut and pickled onion and cucumber dressing within. The Guyere imparted a nice nuttiness that melded the flavors together nicely.  Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips [$30 / $29 Total Rewards]  Cod, fresh dill tartar sauce, minted mushy peas, lemon  The fish and chips featured moist and flaky cod without its skin (luckily for the GF). The batter was crisp and light. The thick steak fried were not crisp, but came with more of a roasted texture. The minted mushy peas were light on mint and were a bit watery.  Grilled Lamb Burger [$21 / $20 Total Rewards] 8 oz, caramelized onions, goat cheese-feta spread, rosemary brioche bun  I went with the stellar lamb burger, which was cooked to a nice medium and housed within a perfectly proportioned brioche bun. The grassiness of the lamb was accented by the goat-cheese and feta spread, with the caramelized onions adding a nice richness to each bite.   So if you're looking to indulge in proper gastropub fare while watching a game with some friends, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill will set you right.",

He gave us a discount initially but because the food and service was of such bad quality he assured us we would not be charged for the lunch. The next day there was a charge on my card which returned my money back to my account. I was Happy at least they are considerate about their customers  but no they charged me back the same amount week later and when chase disputed my charge they denied they had allowed a refund... What a bunch of D!%ks  And isn't Gordon Ramsey British ??? I guess fish and chips is their only Specialty......How can you fuck that up so royally ???? I think all that shouting on his shows has messed up the recipe for his Lamb Burger and the Pathetic dish which he assumes is Butter chicken (My Dog could cook better than that )  I rather eat on a Taco Stand in Vegas than come back here again ....

While all the restaurants at Cesars Palace were fully booked as expected (even the food court line was up the wall), we were seated within 10 minutes at this restaurant. They were also extremely busy yet they were able to accommodate a family of 6 at the peak of their dinner time which was 7:30 pm. We were never rushed, server was very knowledgable of the menu and specials, our water was refilled constantly, and when they made a mistake with the way one of the burgers were cooked, they replaced it within minutes. They even gave complimentary truffle fries.   Now for the calamari, it is by far the best I have ever had! And I've had a ton in my lifetime.  It was so tender and fried to perfection! Great portions too. I would come back over and over just to have it. We could've had a lousy take out or room service for our New Year's Eve dinner but Gordon Ramsay staff turned it all around. Keep up the good work!!!",

Knew the menu, shared interesting factoids about our beer and appetizer choices, and the food was served fairly quickly (the restaurant is huge). We had the Toad in the Hole (appetizer), Shepherd's Pie, and Bangers and Mash. All of it was delicious. The Dijon mustard/horeradish combo were tasty with the appetizer, the Shepherd's Pie was the perfect comfort food, and you'll want to mainline the onion gravy on the B&M. We also had the Butterscotch Madeleine for dessert. It's perfect for two and was delicious.    All in all, we had a great time and will definitely be making an effort to visit the other Ramsay restaurants in Vegas.",

The lamb shanks is absolutely the best we've ever had!  The salad dressing was so different and so good. The brussel sprouts was fantastic!  For dessert, highly recommend the English sticky toffee pudding!  Most restaurants dont make their desserts. . they buy the typical cheesecakes, brownies,  etc...but here... they actually make their own!!  Service was excellent.",

Everyone around us was in OOOHS and AHHS over the sheer perfection of their drink.  I had a moment (maybe a buzzed one) where I thought \"Wow.... mixed drinks are an art\".  I like it.    And since I didn't want to eat a full meal, I decided to splurge on a few appetizers to share.   Deviled eggs (with bacon), pretzel, and olives. All fantastic - particularly the eggs; they got a little creative with them (but nothing too far out there!).    Will be back!",

My friend and I went during happy hour, so we got a couple bucks off of our drinks (Angry Orchard & Goodbye Blue Sky cocktail) and got a $7 app (mini corn dogs). Be prepared for how strong the cocktails are! Super worth trying one though! Anyways, we got mini corn dogs, oven roasted Scottish salmon, lobster Mac and cheese, and the pesto chicken sandwich with kettle chips. I don't have one bad thing to say about this place.

The only great part was the fish and chips, without the chips. The chips were soft, and taste frozen. We expected it to taste like blow your mind kind of chips, like how you would see them made in his show. Nope, the chips were just soggy fries. The fish was great thought. They used fresh fish and it was a good size, enough to share between you and a child. The batter was nice and crispy and not oily at all. We also had the lobster roll, which was also pretty good, but we've had better elsewhere. The cost was expensive, even if she shared an entree with shared appetizer. Would we come here again? Probably not. Would we go to Hell's Kitchen? Hell yeh!",

The beef is soft but with a little crispy edge, very well grilled. It comes with French fries, ketchup and garlic creamy sauce on the side. I think the tasty level of the burger is around the same as holy chuck. So if u love holy chuck (like me!) you will love this place too. My friend's chicken breast is also very tender, not over cooked at all. Overall if only considering the taste I will give them 4 star. Why I give 5 star then? Their service is great! My friend thinks her salad has a little bit too much sauce which makes it taste a little too salty. The server insisted on change a new one for us even though we said it is ok. So the server gave us a new salad with all request my friend wanted. And then the floor manager came short afterwards to apologize for our \"unpleasant\" experience and offer to provide us a makeup desert (although we refused since we were reeeeeeeally full!).   Overall, it's a great restaurant to try. We had a good time here!",

Once we got our check, we took notice that the amount charged for each item (Calamari, Salmon, and Chicken lollipops) were higher than what was stated on the menu. Because, we already received a discount with our comps we decided not to complain about the issue. However, I was informed by  my friend that another guest had experiences the same problem in which she read on Yelp.  Food - it was actually above mediocre for bar food! I especially liked the French Onion! The decor was trendy and meshed well together, all the way down to the silverware. Kudos to the interior designer and restaurant consultant that created the vision and theme. Even the music, Depeche Mode and The Clash, was on point!   Service - Disappointing. Server is on his phone in clear sight of guests. The table behind us actually had to get up and tap a server on the shoulder to get assistance. The server, in turns, mocks the guest to another co-worker a few minutes later. Although, the server and server assistant were cordial to us and even doing their touch backs, professionalism lacked. Hostess did do the initial verbal greet and eye contact but lacked personality.",

A blackberry vodka concoction which was very tasty! The kettle chip nachos combined so many basic flavors in an awesome way!! No getting to the bottom of the plate and all the toppings were gone.  Then the French Onion Soup was the best I have ever had and I love french onion soup and have tried it everywhere! The salmon was moist and cooked to perfection and the lemon mash potatoes complemented the fish. The sticky toffee pudding was so good we wanted lick the plate...in fact I did lick the Carmel container.  Outstanding experience all the way around!",

The french fries were old, the steak and ale pie pastry was also old and had obviously been either standing for a few hours before it was served to my wife. Sausage and mash - mash was really dry and hard. The scotch eggs appetizer was pathetic. The only savior for the experience was our server who was excellent, otherwise it would be a two star rating. I hope someone from Gordon Ramsey's staff reads this and takes some action, but I'm sorry to say I wouldn't take the risk of going to this particular restaurant again. I'm sure If Gordon ate what we did tonight, he would be ashamed.",

I expected the cost to be on the high end based on it was a GR restaurant, but the portion sizes were relatively small for their costs. We basically felt like we needed to order dessert just to fill our bellies.  I wasn't crazy disappointed, but I suppose I expected more from a Gordon Ramsay branded establishment. My friend whom I went with had been to his other new spot BURGR and enjoyed it, and I've been to the other one STEAK and enjoyed that, so I guess I had higher expectations for this one as well.",

I was glad we made reservations on Opentable along the way. We were seated right away in the back of the restaurant where it was more quiet. Our waiter's name was Adam and he was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the deviled eggs, corn soup, baby greens salad, and the ham and cheese sandwich, all of which I would highly recommend. Everything was very fresh looking and tasting as well as perfectly prepared. I am really looking forward to returning here for another casual but delicious meal. My only complaint is they marked us as a no show on Opentable, but hopefully this will be resolved on their end, as we have already taken it up with Opentable.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at this Ramsay restaurant on June 3rd for lunch.  The hostess and wait staff were excellent.  However, if the food was on a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 5 or 6 at best.  I understand that Gordon Ramsay is not back in the kitchen personally and I understand none of his top Chefs are back there as well.  But I was shocked that he would put his name on the mediocre food that is served there.   I ordered the Onion Soup and my wife ordered the Duck Confit Poutine for our lunch starters.  The Onion soup was good, it had a different after taste but it was a good soup.  My wife was not fond of the flavor of the soup.  Her Duck Confit Poutine was tasteless and was a slightly warm glob of a mess and again it was really tasteless.    For our main dish I had the Traditional Sheppard's Pie and she had the Pub \"Spots\" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.)  My Sheppard's pie was ok, not great but not horrible, I was shocked that it came out of a Gordon Ramsay kitchen.  It was bland and a bit greasy, it tasted like pot roast  that was served in my elementary school which I was not a fan of.   I have had much better Sheppard's Pie at Walt Disney World's EPCOT.   My wife's the Pub \"Spots\" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.) were ordered Med Rare and came out over well done.  The overcooked burgers were taken off the bill, not by our request but by the server who agreed that they were not cooked properly and were way over cooked.   The wait staff again was excellent and I tipped her approx 30 percent because she and the rest of the staff were excellent.     I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan and really enjoy reading his cookbooks and his television shows.  However, after the let down at Gordon Ramsay Steak and now at the Pub.    I just don't think I can spend our money on a product that is supposed to be top quality in all aspects and falls short, but you never know what the future brings..  I may go back..",

The table next to us was having similar problems! Oh yeah and they were out of scotch eggs! Not what you would expect from chef Gordon Ramsay.

    "text": "Family trip to Vegas, quite a few Ramsey fans amongst us.  Total of 8 diners off of the grill menu.  We made a reservation and our table was ready for us.  Service - Solid.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable.  The staff was attentive to our needs with regard to keeping water full and table clear.  My only complaint would be the drink menu.  I can dig conserving paper and flashy electronics, but passing a couple iPads around to place drink orders was a bit of a hassle.  Ambiance - I liked it.  I wouldn't call it a traditional pub, but the feel is there.  The noise level is moderate, with an eclectic mix of British rock/pop on the playlist.  The uniforms fit with the theme.  I work with beer for a living and I am without a doubt overly anal retentive with regards to it.  So, a wall made of kegs in a British themed pub didn't sit right with me.  Casks would have been much more appropriate.  Speaking of casks . . .  Beverages - Admittedly, we were all looking at beer, it's a pub after all.  For everyday beer selection, I'd give it a big thumbs up.  Lots of imported and expected domestic draft options, and a more craft friendly bottle selection.  I got a Union Jack, brother got a Sculpin, mom got a SNPA.  Their's was fresh, mine wasn't.  Que Sera, at least the options were there.  I would say this is more disappointing after visiting BURGR this afternoon and being offered a much more impressive beer list.  Lastly, it is a Pub, how is there nothing on cask?  If you are an avid beer advocate temper your expectations.  Food - Not one of the 8 off us left disappointed or hungry.  Between the 8 of us we tried the Pork and Lamb Rillettes appetizer, Lamb T-bone, Shepard's Pie, Brick Pressed Cornish Hen, Clams and Mussels, Pork Belly and sides of Brusselspouts and Fingerling Potatoes.  Bread and starters: The bread, holy geez the bread.  A selection of pretzel breads and a beer roll served with Devonshire butter and a Welsh cheddar spread with horseradish.  I can't believe they don't charge for this, it is easily one of the best things that was put on our table.  The Rillettes were excellent as well.  I favored the pork over the duck, which admittedly was a bit bland for duck.  It comes with a fabulous horseradish infused mustard, crispy acidic house made pickles of carrot and radish.  Mains - I am going to jump right to it.  Everything was at least good, but the Shepard's Pie is absolutely astounding and I would say the best thing we had on the table.  The pork belly, which I ordered was very good, crispy and fatty just as it should be.  It has a pea puree with it that is hardly noticeable and tiny chippolini(sp?) onions for sweetness.  All together great dish I wouldn't hesitate to order again.  I did not try a clam, but the mussels were great.  They were massive and came swimming in a delicious broth and a few heels of bread to drag through it.  The hen we a little dry but, my goodness, was the skin crispy.  The lamb was well prepared, perfectly cooked.  It is topped with Stilton, which I find to be a relatively medium flavored blue cheese, but in this situation it surprisingly dominated the lamb.  It was good to be sure, but could be better.  Sides:  The brusselsprouts were outstanding, simply prepared with bacon and apples.  Cooked perfectly, flavorful and a great compliment to the fatty pork.  The potatoes were potatoes.  They are tough to screw up and were not here.  Overall - For the 8 of us it came to just under $50/person, but I'd say that is a comfortable number for the experience we had. I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",

We were seated in these tall backed seats that seemed in natural and difficult to sit on while eating.  The seats are meant more for watching tv with your feet up.  I'm a big boy and 6'2\", my son is an average 10 yo boy. Between us and everyone else in between we couldn't find it comfortable.  It took a while for someone to tend to us.  All the waiters were walking fast back n forth like chickens without heads.  And we're trying to figure out which one was our waiter.  When he finally showed up we ordered.  We didn't see him again until he brought our food.  Meanwhile our drinks took forever to be refilled.  When the food came out we all thought it was mediocre. Burger, chicken dish, salad andI can't even remember what I got cause it probably wasn't much to remember.  Between the uncomfortable seating arrangement, non enthusiastic waiter and barely  edible food this is the last time I go there and has now made me question Gordon Ramsay as a chef.  Seeing his shows, how strict and tough he is, I couldn't believe this guy owned this establishment.  He would flip if he experienced what we experienced.  I expected a lot more, and when you put your name behind something, you better make sure they represent you accurately.",

The drinks tasted good but I didn't feel like there was enough alcohol in them for the price they charged. My main problem with this restaurant is the speed of service. When you're in Vegas, you don't want to be wasting time waiting for a server to come take your order or bring your food. You want to be in and out and on the way to the tables, clubs, shows, or whatever else you're planning on doing. We were seated quickly but then had to wait nearly 15 minutes before our waitress came to the table. After she finally made an appearance, service speed improved but when it came time to pay, we had to wait again. After giving her my credit card, it took her nearly 15 minutes to bring it back. The restaurant wasn't that busy and it seemed to be fairly standard as other tables had to wait for their server to arrive as well.   Other than the speed of service, the food was delicious and the atmosphere fun and lively. I would definitely return, just wished the service was faster.",

Service is good too. We ended up getting the beef burger with bacon and it was fantastic. A little small to split but good none the less. Very juicy, great bread and thick pieces of bacon. We were very pleased. The fries were delicious too. On another occasion, we stopped in for another beer and the pretzel. Having been to Germany, our pretzel standards are high and this pretzel was average. There are three \"sticks\" instead of one large one. The accompanying mustard is good; beer cheese is ok. I'm not certain we'd order it again. We did end up ordering the nachos that time after seeing another patron's order. They were pretty good! Made of (homemade?) potato chips instead of tortilla chips, the meat was good and the cheese was better than most other (fake cheese) nachos we've ordered. We'd probably get these again.",

For apps we had Pretzel Sticks and Onion Rings.  My ten year old, who doesn't eat onions, tried an onion ring and gave a thumbs up.  The pretzel sticks were soft on the inside with a dark, chewy exterior.  Delicious! Our main courses were the Fish and Chips, Hell's Kitchen Ghost Pepper Burger and a Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The light crispy batter on the fish was out of this world.  Chips were seasoned wedge-ish shapes, crispy outside and soft inside, yum.  I had the Ghost Pepper burger and was delightfully pleased with the heat level, knowing it wouldn't be crazy hot for the masses and hopeful it would have a nice bite.  The after-burn was perfect.  Chicken Pesto was delicious as well. Dessert we had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding at the suggestion of the waiter, knowing full well they push certain dishes but he didn't steer us wrong with the appetizers.  OMG!!!  When we got back to our room I immediately began searching for recipes (still haven't tried it though).  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is to DIE for, I have no more words.  Just thinking about makes my mouth water.  Ok. Our waiter was great, staff makes the experience.  He took our order with no notes and we all received exactly what we ordered.  I was in the mood for a cocktail and asked for his recommendation and he brought me a drink with blackberry and something else.  I don't remember, but it was super tasty.  Not too sweet with whatever alcohol in the background. If we lived closer I would definitely go back and tell all my friends about it (I'll do that anyway).  Two thumbs WAY up!",

We had the clams for an appetizer and they were the best clams I had ever eaten.  I had the fish and chips.  The fish was awesome, the chips just so-so.  My wife had the chicken pot pie and somehow it was very good.  I would have never thought chicken pot pie could  have been so tasty!  My son had the bangers and mash and he is a foodie and loved his entree!  My wife's friend had the rib and loved it also.  The sticky toffee pudding was insanely great!  Best dessert ever!!!  Service was good.",

    "text": "I loved this restaurant the first time I went in 2013 and was excited to return. The last two visits have been such a huge disappointment that I will not be coming back.  The first time I visited the menu was much more expansive, they had iPads with endless craft beer and wine selections and the food was delicious. When I came back a year later the iPads were gone, the menu items were different and there were less of them.  The food was greasy, bland, and spectacularly over priced for the quality. On my latest visit in July 2015 I ordered the short ribs, which turned out to be only one piece and boneless. Not what I expected, but at least it will taste good, right? Well actually, it didn't taste like anything at all. The meat was tender but had no flavor or sauce to help support it. The barley risotto had zero salt and was reminiscent of plain oatmeal. For a $40 plate I expected much more.  I gave my review two stars because the pretzels and cheese sauce were good enough, my glass of wine came in a small carafe so it felt like a generous amount for the price and the service was ok. Not enough positives to come back again, too bad.",

    "text": "Request a booth on the right with a TV.  The warm pretzel bread with cheese sauce was amazing. We ordered Sheppard's Pie and Flank Steak and shared. The Flank steak was one of the top steaks ever ordered in a restaurant, so tender and perfect. Loved the cocktails. The Sheppard's Pie looked smaller than it was - very filling, even for two, if you get another plate too.  It's shredded beef and was so tender. We couldn't finish it all.  The onion soup was great - a little sweeter and less salty than the french version.  My husband wanted to add salt, but there's none of that on the table. Without reservations, we'd have waited a while. It's only steps away from the concert venue, Elton John, so perfect place for dinner if you plan to see that show. The service was good - four or five hostesses to greet you - which one do I choose. The bartender was swamped, so took a while for drinks.  The manager came by several times and walked the restaurant a lot.  The guy who dropped off our food asked if we would be sharing and offered to bring sharing plates.  I loved the initiative of that. We never had to wait for plates to be cleared - they were picked up right away.  Definitely allow 2 hours for your dining experience.  It's not a fast-food restaurant.  This is a place to come and savor your meal, the company, and the ambiance.  Nothing is rushed, which I loved.  The table was never crowded and plates weren't coming out on top of each other.  The entire staff was pleasant and enjoyable - contrary to the punk get-up.    I read the reviews prior to coming and almost went somewhere else.  Geez, you guys are hard to please.  I LOVED my experience!  it was pricey, but the special occassion warranted the splurge.  And it's Vegas.  You expect that there.  Glad I decided to take a risk and find out for myself.  I hope others can take these reviews with a grain of salt too.  My only regret was that we were too full for dessert.   Oh, also regret not ordering the deviled eggs at the bar while we waited for our reservation.  Certain menu items in the bar are not available at the table.   Will definitely go back!  Suggestion:  If you plan to have a full dinner, make reservations and request a booth or a high table.  A lot of the tables are low, better for drinks and appetizers, but not a meal.  And also request the back of the restaurant.  I also didn't like the fishbowl effect of the front of the restaurant.  Once you're well inside the restaurant, you feel more cozy and intimate.",

We had a very unusual experience and the entire staff came together to help us out.   It was our last night and we wanted to ensure that we dined at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants before returning home. We are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay.  We had just selected our food and drinks when my husband had a sudden nosebleed and had to leave to go to the washroom.  The drinks came.... I placed our order........the food came.......I tried to eat  my chopped pub salad (which was delicious).....and my husband still wasn't back.  Our server VERY discretely asked if everything was ok and when I explained the situation he offered to go check on him.  He alerted his Supervisor who also discreetly offered assistance.  After 45 minutes, when the medical situation was under control we thanked our server and as we were getting ready to leave the Manager also came by to ensure that everything was under control before we left.  The restaurant was very busy but the Manager spent considerable time to make us feel comfortable and valued.    Everyone in this establishment went above and beyond during a very busy time.  Gordon Ramsay should be very proud of his staff (in addition to his great food)!!!!!  We will definitely return when we are in Vegas next year.",

Mini burgers were dry and cold. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good, but not great. I told the waitress of my burger complaint and she did not seem interested.   Apparently the standard that Chef Ramsey has on his television shows are not the same in his restaurants. It seems to me if you put your name to something and profess excellence, it should be excellent; not just alright.",

Regardless, we got our beers (HIGHLY recommend Innis & Gunn) within 5 minutes of ordering, which was quick considering there were no empty tables. The food came about a half hour later. The fish and chips were excellent- great flavor, crisp, and hot as they should be served. Based on the food and beer alone, I'd give 5 stars.  Unfortunately, this place is dishonest in marketing. Signs everywhere in the hotel advertised happy hour Monday-Friday 2-5PM in the bar. We went at 4:40PM in the bar, yet we were told no happy hour existed for that Friday due to the 4th of July weekend. Don't advertise happy hour when you're not having it. It's sad this restaurant wanted to rake in even more profits and didn't let people enjoy beer at a lower price to celebrate the weekend. 3 stars.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Gordon Ramsay's third Vegas restaurant- it seems to be the least favorite based on the ratings but I still had a solid experience with Bethany E. Server uniforms are fun, as are the little decorative touches like the custom cutlery. Dining room is much larger than it appears from the outside.  KETTLE CHIP NACHOS: huge portion of house-made kettle chips topped with corned beef, short rib, and English cheddar cheese. Definitely a shareable portion, in terms of size of the dish and how well the flavors worked together. MAINE LOBSTER & SHRIMP ROLL MINIS: Two cute little rolls packed with shrimp and lobster salad. This version is way better than those served at the Phillips Seafood nearby. Generous amount of lobster and perfectly toasted, buttered rolls. GRILLED LAMB BURGER: Yes, it's as good as other reviews say. Lamb was cooked perfectly medium, topped with curry onions (flavor was subtle) and a thick layer of goat cheese and feta spread. The burger itself was so good, we barely touched the side of fries- even though they come with a delicious garlic aioli that I couldn't get enough of.    Heads up, the menu seems to change pretty frequently and many of the dishes mentioned and shown in previous reviews are no longer available so don't get your heart set on any one thing. Service checked in on us frequently but didn't go over any specials and didn't seem up the same standards as at the other restaurants. Would come back to try the fish and chips or one of the pies.",

    "text": "Located across from Caesars Colosseum, it's the perfect place to grab a bite before seeing a show.  A friend and I were planning on seeing a show there Saturday evening.  We both thought it would be a good idea for an early dinner.  I wasn't sure what the crowd was like so I made reservations just in case.   We were greeted and seated immediately.   As the hostess was walking us to our table, that was the point I noticed how large the place really was.  There is an abundance of seating throughout.  Scott was our waiter for the evening.  He was attentive and friendly.    With Yelp friends like Stefany, we can order and split items.  We decided on the Grilled Lamb Burger with fries, Lobster and shrimp rolls and Kettle Chip Nachos.  All delicious and tasty!  Here's the low down:  The kettle chip nachos had a decent amount of tender short ribs scatter about topped with an English cheddar cheese.  The house made kettle chip was delightfully crunchy and sturdy to hold the nacho toppings.    The lobster & shrimp rolls were also a hit.  They had a light lemon zest already blended in the lobster & shrimp mix.  This little brioche sandwich is delectable.    The Grilled Lamb Burger was probably the highlight for me.  Grilled perfectly, this burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The goat & feta cheese spread really clinched the blue ribbon.  BUT WAIT! The accompanying french fries are served with a garlic aioli that is to die for! Phenomenal.  I wanted to take a to go bowl of that home but I think that was frowned upon.    G.R. has once again impressed me with his menus and food.",

Started with the lobster/shrimp roll...very nice on a buttery roll...sorry no picture. I ordered the braised shortribs and my sister ordered the steak and ale pie. Both were very tasty and presented nicely. The carrots were a bit on the hard  side.  Pie dough not as flaky as we hoped, but tasty. Food came out a little slowly. This is a noisy place (which is ok if you expect it) with TV screens showing the current football game and everyone seated fairly close to one another but not too close that you can over hear each other. I used my free sticky toffee pudding dessert from Yelp..thanks Yelp and my sister got the apple tart.  The pudding was definitely sweet but a nice light cake that comes with ice cream and a side of caramel. My sister's tart came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream which was very good. The tart itself was ok. Again the pastry was a bit on the tough side. If staying at the hotel again will definitely be back...next time I'll try the fish n chips, they looked amazing. Service was very nice as well.",

We love all things Gordan Ramsey, just not sure if this is an accurate highlight of his talents.   The butter chicken curry is supposedly one of the star dishes which takes four days to prepare. While the chicken was tender and the curry was decent, the basmati rice was actually one of my favorite parts of the dish. The naan was a pretty charred (which the boyfriend actually loved... Me, not so much) and the yogurt tasted like it was just plain yogurt with a bit of citrus.  I'd take lower-quality Indian buffet food over this for a fraction of the price.   The charcuterie board came with slightly more than a single serving of each item and the cheeses of the night were a Cabot cheddar (wait, can't I get a while block of this at the store?) and what I think was a drunken goat cheese... Something that sounded oddly close to a featured cheese they had at Trader Joe's the other day...   Over all not impressed. Kind of a let down for such a big name. What a gimmick.",

We were not half way through our apps when the entrees came out.  We commented to the expeditor that we were still working on our appetizers, he shrugged and said sorry...and walked away.  The Lamb Burger ordered was very good, no complaints but the Fish and Chips, the chips were just barely warm and soggy but the fish was hot, fresh and delicious.  We did notice that other tables that had apps also had their meals come out before they were half finished with their first course.  I am not sure if management was trying to turn tables quickly but the entree coming out before it should is one of my pet peeves!  We finished with the Chocolate Triffle, it was delicious.  Please, please don't rush the meal and check with Chef Ramsey on how to make a proper chip!",

In all fairness, I was overly excited for this opportunity owing to the fact that I have been watching Ramsey on a number of TV programs for some time, and he is hands down my favorite celebrity chef. That being said, I was a bit disappointed that after an hour long wait for a table, it took another ten minutes after being seated to even be approached by a waitress, upon which we finally received water and a drink menu. I had the scotch egg appetizer and the mussels and clams, both of which I thought were delicious. I was surprised by the heftiness of the mussel plate...I'm guessing there was at least 2 lbs. of shellfish on there. Overall, good pub food, but service needs a bit of work.",

    "text": "I recently visited Gordon Ramsay Pub in Caesars Palace after having a positive experience two years ago.  As a Celiac I am always in search of SAFE dining experiences.  Boy was I ever HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED with both the service and the menu.  I was told by the hostess that they did indeed have a gluten free menu, however when I asked for the GF menu at the table I was told the gluten free menu was \"not up to date\" -- which in short meant \"non-existent\".  Food that should be \"clean and free of gluten\" had added gluten (the shrimp for shrimp cocktails is poached in beer).  The waiter pointed out in a snarky manner that I could eat \"most\" of the beef (steak) selections and salad; his attitude was visible wth slumped shoulders and short, snippy sentences.  Not one single chicken item was a safe choice.  I finally just stood up and said I could eat Salad ANYWHERE.  I left and I will not be back although I stay at Caesars 4-5 times per year. The waiter finally realized when I stood up that I was angry and I did make my comments heard by the surrounding tables.  I don't think Gordon Ramsay realizes that Celiacs AND THEIR FAMILIES will not dine where it is not safe for the entire family to eat.  We went directly to Mesa Grill where I was treated with respect and offered many appealing GF food items.  The chef and manager assured me in person that they knew what they were doing.  And the food was scrumptious.    Bad, bad, bad experience--Celiacs and gluten sensitive folks beware of Gordon Ramsay establishments.",

Both times I've been here the service has been above and beyond what one could possibly expect, with Scott being an exceptionally cool server who was honest (no to the lobster mac n cheese and steering us to the shepherds pie) . I'm afraid to over-hype this place, but I really can't say anything really bad about it. It's not cheap, but they use real ingredients and you're not going to leave hungry. Sometimes quality food costs more, and let's be real here, Gordon Ramsay is a name brand so there has to be a mark up. I definitely recommend eating your heart out here!",

I think that, like everyone has said, Gordon Ramsay needs to come back and whip the ex Hell's Kitchen winner back into shape.   We made a reservation for 1 pm and we wound up missing one of our people. We told our waiter that we were just going to order/eat without him, and it took so long for him to take our orders.   My fiance liked the bangers and mash, the fish and chips were a little sour tasting (weird). If you go, you should order the duck poutine, that was the best thing!",

Truffle fries were 2 out of 10, mini pub burger tasted like old dirty oily bread, and the nachos are really thick homemade potato chips that tasted like oil. Hostess made us wait 30 minutes to be seated even though there was over 20 tables available in sight. Cups and utensils were very dirty, the second set they brought was even dirtier. After waiting at the table for over 15 minutes to get service, I had to twirl my napkin over my head like a lasso to get noticed. Also, the napkin was very weird and looked like it was made from a dirty old hotel curtain.",

I wasn't really sure if I wanted to eat here due to being overpriced and mediocre reviews, but I figured we should at least give it a chance.  For appetizer we got deviled eggs which were really good.  I got the Shepard's Pie. It was so bland. I was rather disappointed with that.  My boss got a sandwich that was essentially two giant pieces of bruschetta. She didn't enjoy that.  My coworkers got fish and chips and the beef burger. You would think the burger would be just as good as the burgers at Burgr, but it wasn't.   The service was ridiculously bad. We asked for ketchup and salt, waited forever, finally was able to flag down the waiter again and he said yeah, I'm working on it. Who says that and why would it take so long to get ketchup and salt?? Everyone was trying to eat slow, waiting for the condiments...  The desert was amazing though. I got the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle. If I were to go back here, I would just order that desert. And maybe the deviled eggs.",

I've been to my share of the \"pubs\" in town, most notably the pubs by Todd English and Michael Mina, and was expecting a similar experience.   The drinks were delicious, most notably the Pub's version of a Moscow Mule, but my food was mediocre at best. Perhaps I ordered something really random in the Pub's version of Butter Chicken with basmati rice, but the sauce was bland and way too peppery at the same time. The rice was tender and well-cooked, but so drenched in butter that it appeared yellow. Other friends ordered fish and chips, the pea soup, the sliders, and fries. The fries were soggy and limp, which was a huge letdown. Everything was else was fine, just nothing to write home about.  The atmosphere is fun, but that was probably the best part.",

One star off for overly fussy closing hours:  pints ordered and delivered at last call but then \"Here are your to-go cups, get out of here: no you can't have five minutes more\".  Not clear what the rush was:  spent 10 minutes finishing the drinks standing by the entrance with the to-go cups with no sign of clearing our table or any rush to really close the place.  Ah well, we were out of there, which I guess is what they wanted.  Definitely left a sour impression at a place I went to every night of my stay.  Still recommended, but not as enthusiastically as I had hoped.",

It was a little weird to find green peas on the plate of fish and chips, but whatever, it worked.  Also, we told our waiter that we were sharing all 3 dishes, and he took the initiative to split all our orders. Awesome or what?  I'd say that this is authentic English pub food but at Gordon Ramsay prices.",

Your typical union environment that you can tell no one working wanted to be there.   Food was all extremely bland. I can't say it was bad but it had absolutely no \"pop\" in flavor whatsoever. I would expect more but given the location it's your typical get them in and get them out tourist trap mentality.

Was here last week for a bite to eat and to catch the college hoops championship game. The bar area itself is huge with many stools to take a seat and watch the game on one of the large flatscreens hanging above. As you can imagine this place is loud and hopping being right off the main casino floor across the sportsbook area. Cool trendy design with beer kegs decorating the walls. Plenty of tables in a very open air kind of setting.   Personally, I had no problem with the service here as it was just right. I just wanted to hang at the bar with a drink and watch the game anyway. The beer selection is terrific and having Innis & Gunn on tap is a winner. Bartenders were attentive and fast with slinging the drinks. Had to try the fish & chips here, as it's one of my favs. It was just ok but I have had better. I felt the batter was just not crispy enough and lacked overall flavor that I expected. Not a bad meal, but with all the choices in town I was a bit dissatisfied.   Still, one gets the feeling that this is just another Vegas corporate chain type trendy restaurant. Not bad overall, and would come back again for a cold brew next time in Ceasars.",

Highly recommend the Drunken Grasshopper, which is both delicious and heavy on the alcohol.  The shepherd's pie is another favorite.  Nice ambiance and a good amount of food.",

    "text": "Haters gonna hate. Does not deserve the low reviews. Let me tell you why.   People are complaining about service and steep price point. They do know they are in Vegas right? Also, the word PUB is in the name, that literally means that it's a casual ambiance so chill the hell down.   Food was remarkable. Sister had the deviled eggs, I had the lamb burger, wife had the ale onion soup. All of which were perfect.   I love lamb. You can say you love it more but I will disagree. I don't like the actual animal, I like the meat it gives. It's juicy. It has that remarkable taste. Leaves a taste that lingers in your mind.  This lamb was cooked perfectly. Great burger. Great price. You're in Vegas. It's in the middle of the dessert. Food isn't cheap.   The ale onion soup lived up to its name and tasted like ale reduction. A fun take on the French onion soup.   Service was FANTASTIC. I wish I could remember our waitress name but she was amazing.  Side note: if you're the manager reading this, she had blonde hair and was stationed by the kitchen entrance that served the booth with 2 love seats, on 8/08 , around 4pm. Give her a high five.   - not five stars because the food won't blow you away but it will get the job done right -",

We were greeted by 4 hostesses and one manager upon which we were seated immediately. The crowd was a mixture of people, families, business men from a local convention, vacationers. Being that this is a Ramsay restaurant we expected so much more seeing how he calls people out for the smallest things on television, but alas the food was very average. We started with calamari.. it arrived less then a minute after we ordered it? How is that even possible? The breading was just okay. The squid itself, soft as butter~ Delicious.   After finishing nearly the entire plate (more then enough for 2 people) we ordered our burgers (what we came for in the first place) one lamb burger, the taste was good but nothing spectacular and a Hell burger... to which my wife commented \"Meh. I like yours better.\" 70 dollars later we were full, of food but nothing else too memorable. The waitstaff was pleasant and ridiculously fast. We spent a total of maybe 30 minutes in there at 6pm on a Tuesday... We didn't order drinks and the fries were some glorified version of a MacDonald's recipe. The sauce they came with was delicious though... Nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "What a wonderful place to eat! I was here with some colleagues for a work event and ended up eating here twice: once for lunch and once for dinner.   The ambiance is very modern pub with lots of colors and fun decor. They have lots of beer options, great Bloody Mary's and a decent wine offering.   The staff is fun and polite. Well versed in the menu options and smartly dressed in their British fare. We especially enjoyed our server, John, this evening. He was engaging, polite, and happy that we were there. We felt welcomed and appreciated.   The menus are slightly different - lunch from dinner, but all the food is good. It is well seasoned and wholly satisfying. I had the Reuben for lunch. It was huge! Very traditional, but definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had with buttered toasted bread and generous portions of sauerkraut and meat.  One of my colleagues had the mussels (an appetizer) for her meal. They were in a large pot and again the portion was more than generous.  The sauce was a buttery white wine sauce, very tasty.   Another colleague had the curry chicken with yellow rice. I'm not a huge curry fan, but my friend raved over the dish.  On our dinner trip, we had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail.  It came with 5 extremely large prawns, but even with their size they were perfectly prepared so that they weren't tough. The cocktail sauce was well balanced and had a nice horseradish flavor without being too spicy.  Then we shared the fish and chips. It is an enormous portion and the fish was well breaded with a very nice piece of fish. It was a great option.  With both meals the table shared a Sticky Toffee Pudding. It is a wonderful sweet to end the meal without being too heavy or overly sugary.   This was a great experience both in food and service. And the prices weren't too bad, for Vegas.",

I had the Wagyu filet and Creamed Spinach, and my daughter had the Tasting Menu which is Gordon's signature dishes from Hell's Kitchen. Scallops, Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Cake. The food was pure heaven. I will remember this meal for a very long time. Our server, Rodney, made our culinary experience even more elevated. Rodney is the best server bar none.  He is very friendly, warm and welcoming. His knowledge of the menu and all things Ramsay was delightful. You will not be disappointed if you go here for dinner, and if you do ask to be seated in Rodney's section.",

The hostess we met was friendly and seated us immediately- I was worried because the place looked busy.   Our waiter Scott was smiley & friendly and took our drink order - good thing is we have our normal usual suspects for drinks.  The place setting was unique- a small wooden chopping board with leather edges where the knife and fork stayed.  After our drinks were ordered, we placed our food order.  I've been to the UK and suggested what to eat as shared small plates.  Corned beef poutine fries, shrimp plate, ale & meat pie was our choice.  The poutine fries was topped with cheese curds & strands of corned beet over fries.  So good, but it was a bit salty because of the corned beef. The serving size is just right if you're sharing this dish.  My favorite was the beef & ale meat pie. Though is was more like a meat pot pie - versus a full pie encased in puffed pastry It still took me back to England when I tried it for the first time.  Shrimp were huge and succulent & there was pretzel bread that was chewy and soft.  The whole experience from start to finish was amazing.  Scott & the rest of the waitstaff were friendly and made us feel at home.  If you're looking for pub fare with some good drinks- stop by here and enjoy a quick bite & leave with a smile.  :)",

    "text": "What a pleasant unexpected trip. We really wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay fish and chips but the line was out the door. We decided to the pub and grill because they had fish and chips too.   Service was good. A little awkward. The waiter was making small talk with us before we ordered and we were so hungry we just wanted to order THEN talk. He was polite, speedy and always topped our drinks off.   Fish and chips were as tasty as ever. A bit bigger and paired with the smash peas. Not our thing as we though they tasted horrid, however that's the thing to eat in Britain.   Next the lobster Mac n cheese. Wow! Talk about cheesy and large pieces of fish. My daughters couldn't finish it all so we took it to go.   The Sheppard's pie was my favorite. The presentation was fantastic and eye appealing. The small pretzel was a nice touch, including the pots. Fresh veggies were nice and different. They didn't get eaten as my dad only eats fries. The mash potatoes on top were very creamy and flavorful. It was meaty underneath and crispy from baking.   My Ruben was delicious! The sauerkraut was perfect ratio to meat and the sauce on it was the kicker. I had promised babe half and I wished I wouldn't have. My chips I didn't like and so I ate babes French fries.   My only complaint was that I wish there was a kids menu. I like kid friendly places on the strip. Families want to have fun and eat great food too.",

The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium but  it was a little too salty for me. It comes with a side of mashed potatoes and one carrot, asparagus, and onion. I liked that they offer 3 diff types of sauces for the steak: peppercorn, bearnaise, or house sauce which is basically their version of A1.  The burger was good, we liked the garlic aioli it comes with. The fries were kind of bland, I didn't even finish them and I usually love fries... sadly, here it was just too plain.   My friend ordered a Shepard's pie and thought it was ok, the cute little baguette it came with was really hard. Lol she even hit the table with it and it definitely sounded hard.   Would I be back... probably not. None of the food stood out to me but the service we had was excellent! Shout out to Michelle! She made us feel welcomed and always had a smile on her face.   Tip:  check in to get the free sticky toffee bread pudding. It's big and comes a la mode. It's good!",

I loved that the chips were from real potatoes. And the meat was seasoned so well.   Beef Wellington was amazing as well, I just wished there was more of the red wine Demi glace and more of the Wellington. The sides were a big let down though. The potatoes and veggies were nothing to brag about.   The dessert was freaking amazing. His sticky toffee pudding. My god. I thought I was so full but somehow I still found room for it cuz it was freaking heavenly. There are no words to describe this invoice.   The decor was not great though. I hated the \"napkins\". It literally looked like the outside of a sack of potatoes. I get it was part of the theme, but I'd appreciate proper napkins. Also, the price for the quantity? Just meh. I appreciated the experience, but idk if the quality and quantity justify the price.",

We don't mind paying a lot for a tiny portion if you could savor what you're paying for, but like I said, meh... Service was so slow. It wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night mid-August. After we gave our orders, it took 40minutes for our food to be brought out eventhough the place wasn't crowded. Even other tables looked bored waiting for their food. Constantly refilling our waters, I'll give them that (but only because we're thirsty waiting and waiting). I'll skip this one whenever we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "This was my first time eating at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill and I did look forward to this. We went there for late lunch so it wasn't packed. I was so excited to try one of their most popular dishes which is the Beef Wellington and they have it in all Gordon Ramsay Restaurants so I expected a glorious meal of course. My husband and I started with a tomato soup and that was good. We finished it in two minutes after having to wait for 20mins for it and it wasn't even HOT. I was gonna ask our server to at least have them reheat it but no one even checked back on us after we got it. So I just ate it because we were both starving. After another 40minutes, our entrees arrived which are the scallops and the beef Wellington. And both of them were just a disappointment. Both dishes were very dry and the Wellington tasted like blood and it arrived cold, just like the scallops. The scallops we're pretty burnt and dry, and again, we never had anybody checking on us after we got our meal. So we just didn't eat it! This was our first meal of the day given that we had such a long night, because of course it was weekend in Vegas and we were so hungry.   I tried saving my mood with a dessert and it didn't do anything as it was so mushy and just tasted weird.   So yeah. Nothing special. You can definitely get better food and better service elsewhere. There plating is good but taste is more important because you're not there to stare at your food anyway.",

    "text": "To start things off - I'm a Brit and a huge fan of Gordon's.  I've been watching his shows for over ten years, and was excited about trying out his more casual restaurant at Caesar's.   The good:  Service was very sweet - everyone was so courteous and lovely.  A+ for hospitality.  Our bartender was the best, and took care of our food issues without so much as a blink.  The bad:  I have to say, I'm really disappointed that Gordon takes his brand so lightly.  He's a chef, and the food I ordered was sloppily presented, and criminally under-seasoned.    I got the Steak Tartare, which is probably my favourite dish in the entire world.  I get it anywhere I see it on the menu.  The tartare was served in a round on the plate - a very measly serving for $25, but worse, it was unevenly spread, making it look more like a shmear on the plate than a real dish.    The worst of it, however, was the fact that it had practically no flavour whatsoever.  That's really bad.  You don't even have to cook tartare - seasoning is literally the entire dish.  So under-seasoned tartare is just raw beef, poorly plated.   Like I said above, the staff were very sweet, and our drinks were served quickly and professionally.   But jeez... how can you be a chef's name-branded restaurant and not know how to season food?   I'm embarrassed for you.    Going to Hell's Kitchen Monday night for a work dinner.  Hopefully it's a different experience there.",

Lots of people were at the bar, and everyone else was sitting at tables wrapped around it.   Everyone was eating by the time I got there, so it took some time to flag down our waiter. He was awesome, though. Always made good suggestions about beer and wine. I didn't need help with food. Once I saw the flat iron steak, it was an easy decision.  The flat iron took forever to cook, as expected, but it was worth the wait. My other colleagues stuck around to enjoy a few drinks anyways. I love that once our waiter found out one of my colleagues is really into wine, he brought out his favorite bottle and got her going.  For a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, I love the energetic yet laidback vibe. People were here either watching sports or simply hanging out. Like every other packed place in Vegas, it was quite loud, and at times I felt like I had to shout. Happy to cross off another GR spot off my bucket list. Let the culinary exploration continue!",

He was very personable/ accommodating yet again- service was sluggish.  We started with the wings. A little disappointed in them. We noticed they weren't as saucy?! Some of the wings (flat/ wingettes) were broken. The drumettes weren't as meaty and smaller than our prior experiences. Also, noticed one wing that was just a tip mixed into our appetizer.  Pork Belly was average. I would have preferred it to be more on the crispy side.  The Lamb Burger is outstanding. Such a simple yet amazing delight. The BEST thing on the menu in my opinion! Accompany that with the Truffle Fries which add an extra special touch to this burger meal.  Yelpers if you check in here to dine: you may get offered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It is so moist. Perfect amount of sweet. Put the warm toffee sauce on top for the finishing touch. Delicious!",

They were slammed (no doubt), but it took forever to get everyone's drinks to the table. They were running a special; for $20 you got a Guiness and a shot of Jameson. It was awesome and hey, Vegas price, but fun none the less.  We ordered Buffalo Wings to start and they were perfect. Not too crunchy, and a nice sauce Next were the amazing entrees. I had the Corned Beef and Cabbage special (because St. Patrick's Day!) and it was amazing. So flavorful and a healthy sizes portion. I wish I could eat that every day. Just tender and juicy...ah, so good. And with a Guiness, it was a perfect pairing. I had a bite of a lobster roll slider my co worker had, and as a native New Englander, I have zero complaints. It was lite and full of lobster the way it should be.  Service needs improvement, but the food is outstanding!",

Considering it was a fish n' chips typa place, that's exactly what we ordered.   My fish was pretty cold though :(... it came out with a ton of fries, and some sort of pea mash. In order to enjoy the pea mash, one must fancy fennel! The taste of fennel was very overpowering. Probably wouldn't yearn to go back here on future trips, but still gave 3 stars bc the flavor was good despite the temp of the food.",

We just had some drinks but the bartender Keith was outstandingly helpful with explaining the brews and mixed drinks. He seemed to have a deep brewers knowledge about how things were made and the notes to be expected in a drink. As part of the Yelp check-in here we got a free Sticky Toffee Pudding which was very different then most desserts I've had and delicious to boot. I would recommend a stop by here for atleast a drink or 2 to check out the cool atmosphere. I'm sure the food has some good notes as well.",

All of it was served hot, well cooked with a nice presentation. For dessert, the mint chocolate cake and sticky toffee pudding were the perfect end.  The service was superior. Of special note, when packing up leftovers,  one of the meals was accidentally thrown away. They ended up making our friend a whole new meal.

The atmosphere is just prefect, and while it sits right outside the slot machines at Caesar's, once you are inside you feel like you are in a pub, hanging out with friends.  We started with the chicken wings on the recommendation of our waiter, and they were divine, along with the Mac and cheese (which was good but not earth-shattering), and them the Short-Rib, paired with a delicious cherry beer that he also recommended.    You guys. The short rib. It was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had in my life. It fell apart in our mouths, and paired with the gravy and the mashed potatoes, it was heaven. We both moaned our way through it.  So...highly recommended: Short Rib with a side of the chicken wings.  We finished it all off with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and that ALSO made us make unholy noises as we were eating it.  It was a great meal, and not too expensive, seeing how it is Vegas.  The vibe was relaxed, but the food was divine.",

    "text": "I have come to expect great things from Gordon Ramsay restaurants. While the food was still the star of the evening the service left a lot to be desired. I made a reservation for Friday night Nov. 2 at 10:15 pm after the Celine Dion show, but was moved to a second line after checking in with the hostess. It was busy however there were plenty of empty tables available. So after waiting in our second line we were seated in the back corner of the restaurant where we found ourselves ignored by our waiter. The nice lady serving our water was diligent but that seemed to be the only one on her game. Once we ordered (the braised short rib for me and fish and chips for my wife) the food arrived quickly. It was amazing and consistent. It appeared the table next to us was having the same experience we were do the apologies from there waiter. As we waited, and waited and waited after finishing our plates we decided to skip desert to avoid and additional long wait for the sticky toffee pudding that our neighbors just had. Then to top it all off my waiter gave me someone else's check, I'm glad I was paying attention! I'm not sure if a big crowd caught them off guard or if they were just understaffed for that day but I expect only amazing things from any restaurant that bares the name Gordon Ramsay. I hope that they can fix these issues and return to greatnesses.",

It got pretty busy at any casino, especially the one in Caesars Palace. However, when you stepped into Pub and Grill, it seemed like you were in a different world. It is spacious, fun, English driven dining area. It gives you enough privacy to establish a conversation among your group without feeling the rush in Vegas. I am still extremely happy with the food, dining place, and service overall at the place. And I cannot wait to return to Pub and Grill as well as trying other Ramsay restaurants in Vegas!",

There is an additional cost- but totally worth it. My coworker ordered the beef rib plate and other people at the table ordered the fish and chips. Everyone reported that the food was delicious. My boss even claimed that the burger was the best burger he's ever had. I have to agree. The brioche bun was light and toasted. The beef patty was thick and delicious, and cooked to order. I added the truffle fries, and enjoyed every delicious savory bite. The presentation of the plates and meals was great and all the food was flavorful.

They didn't have a milkshake besides vanilla but were able to come up with a chocolate creation to die for, it even had a brownie on the edge.  The only downside with it was only 1/3 full and didn't seem to have enough wait staff. Everything took a little longer than it should have- taking our order, bringing water, bringing the check, processing the check.  Otherwise I would highly recommend.",

    "text": "We were staying at Caesars and decided to grab a quick early dinner with our family who were going to rush off to the airport after dinner.   We ordered the pub bites including the mac and cheese, the cheesy bread (cheese sauce with tomatoes and rye bread?), and the salmon toast.  The salmon toast was pretty good with a crispy toast paired with salmon.  The cheesy bread was horrible.  The bread was cold and too thick and it just didn't go well together with the lukewarm cheesy sauce and a tomato slice.  The mac and cheese was fair.  I like mac and cheese but it wasn't exceptional.    For the main course, we ordered the bangers and mash, along with the shepherds pie.  The shepherds pie description was lamb stew with root vegetables.  In my mind, I thought I thought I was going to get chunks of lamb like in a stew, but when it came, it was just ground lamb, like meat in a regular shepherds pie except it was lamb.  It had a good strong lamb taste so I was fine with it.  But I expected more because it was Gordon Ramsey's shepherd pie.  The bangers and mash was cold and we didn't appreciate it.  We just thought Gordon Ramsey would be yelling if he was there trying his food.    We checked in with Yelp, so we got a free toffee pudding.  The descriptions said it came with almond brittle but it didn't.  When it arrived the waiter poured the butterscotch sauce on top.  It was good, but started getting sweet because it was too much sauce for us.  Would have appreciated it if he didn't pour the sauce or if he poured less.  But it was free so we still appreciated it.    My husband said we should have tried Hell's Kitchen instead, but we thought since we were eating an early dinner and we weren't that hungry yet, so that's why we decided on the pub.",

The service was amazing as our waiter was very attentive.   Reasons for the 3 stars; I was extremely annoyed at the white, heavy set host at the front. Mainly because he sat the white people who arrived AFTER my party and had the nerve to tell me \"someone will get to you\"   Point is, we arrived first so we should have been seated first, despite the volume of people or the foot traffic. And the fact of the rude response I received is what really turned me off and almost made us turn away. The other hostess however was a sweet heart.   The waiter did change my mind, but that does not defeat the fact that we rudely were passed up.   How do you tend to someone who had just walked up even though I was there before their party?   They're really lucky I didn't get ratchet up in there, because I'm not afraid to let shit be known when shit is being done wrong.   Overall, food was good and my wait service was great but I definitely do not want to walk into an establishment, wait patiently for my turn to be seated and then be passed up by a group of white men and it just so happened that the host who sat them also a white man.   Step ya game up honey, that shit is not cute and you know dam well I was pissed.",

Now whether Ramsey's sticks his name on this restaurant or he actually owns and runs it, there comes a time when the hype needs to live up to the fact and this restaurant clearly missed the mark. We ordered the fish and chips. What I got was two pieces of dry over cooked inedible clumps of white fish, accompanied by the 'hand cut' chips that were just too prefect in size and shape to be hand cut. The mushy peas were seasoned too heavily with mint so that all I was tasting was 'mushy mint'. When I asked my server about it I was told in a very derogative way that, 'this is how we do it here'. Well if thats the case, you are doing it wrong. And I know it's Vegas, but where do you get off by charging $11 for a Coors Light, and the glass was not even full! In the end I paid $30 per plate for bland tasteless food, lackluster service and an experience I will not forgot because of how bad it was.",

    "text": "Gordan Ramsay should consider featuring this restaurant on his show Kitchen Nightmares. At some moments, I thought there must be secret cameras filming my exasperating experience for the sake of entertainment and reality TV. But alas, it was just an unintentionally underwhelming dining experience.  I ordered the beef burger, and it was delicious. Juicy, huge, well seasoned and cooked as I requested, medium. Served with ketchup and garlic aioli on a soft bun, it was decadent, rich and meaty, everything one would need after a night out in Vegas. However delicious, I found it to be extremely plain. No options for toppings or anything could have offered some freshness. Just a meat patty, bun and bacon. I can't say it was worth the over $20 price tag for a burger alone. The accompanying fries were nothing special. The fish and chips were good, but extremely oily. I loved that they were huge, thick chunks of fish, and the batter was crispy and flavorful. But just a little too greasy for my taste.  Service is undeniably what put a damper on our experience. Our food took an eternity to come out. The two tables next to us were seated, ate their meals, and even paid their bill all in the time it took for our party of six to receive our food. When we asked for the check, it took an eternity for our credit cards to be processed. Most of our meal was spent anxiously waiting, either for the food, drink refills, and finally, the bill. There was no sense of urgency, and the restaurant was less than half full.  For a restaurant of Gordon Ramsay repute, the service was baffling. I wish he were there to scream at the chef and waitstaff to hurry the f**k up.  Located in Cesar's Palace, this restaurant doesn't seem to get too crowded so it's a good choice for a decent meal if you want to eat somewhere other than the food court or the lines for more popular establishments are too long.",

We arrived 30minutes late from our reservation since it took us a awhile to find this place inside caesar's palace.. the lady was so nice and instead of us waiting another hour, she was able to get us a table (bonus 1million points or is it the bday sash?).. for a party of 5, the bill was just right. We ordered different entree 1) grilled beef burger - (medium)was so good, the fries we know are just regular but it taste differently better than average.. 2) shepherd's pie - not a fan,.. maybe coz the lamb is not my thing.. 3) Fish & Chips was a good one too! The wedge fries that comes with it taste extra special 4) oh my goodness, i forgot what my other friends ordered!!! Lol but over-all, worth the money,! I would dine here again,, our server looks stressed but trying his best since it was sooo busy! I love it! Thank you for my birthday pudding!!!!",

Perhaps its because its Vegas and I have high expectations from every meal, especially considering the premium prices, but coupled with the fact its managed by one of the world's best chef's, I would expect more.  I went with a \"classic Ramsay\" dish; Bangers and Mash. It was pretty small, the sausages tasted a little manufactured and the mash and gravy was just...A-OK. My colleagues had the rueben sandwich, beet salad and Ramsay burger respectively. Again, no one was that impressed by the food and we all left underwhelmed.  In general, Caesar's needs to up their game as they are falling too far behind others such as the Aria, both in terms of hotel/casino standards and the restaurants they have to offer.",

The side salad was a little extra but at least there was an option. Beyond that, Heather was just super friendly so it was a positive experience for my husband and me. I would definitely make another stop at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill!",

We ordered the Scotch Egg, which we had tried at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but it's only available with the tasting menu. It was delicious! It was a bit larger at the pub than the steak house, and I really liked the sauces they serve it with better here. Then we ordered two Ramsay Tonics. Also delicious! We ended up ordering two more each by the end of the visit. We then finished with the sticky toffee pudding, topped with brown butter ice cream. This was one of the best desserts I've had in my life! I highly recommend this place, and will definitely return on my next Vegas vacation.",

    "text": "This review is for their Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2015 menu.   The male servers still don what I'll always refer to as \"Hipster Lederhosen.\" Some things don't change, but second impressions can certainly make up for a bitter first. Round 2: the food, service, the entire experience surpassed my expectations.  Appetizer - Calamari (not on the Restaurant Week menu): Perfectly breaded and fried, but chewy,  First Course - Appetizer - Chopped Salad: Lightly dressed, this had strips of salami, slices of chicken, shrimp, apples, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese -- held off on the chickpeas. Not a bad way to begin a three-course meal.  Second Course - Entree - Pan Seared Scottish Salmon: A solid piece of fish that was light and flaky. The caramelized cauliflower and herbed salad were delicious. I was concerned that the lemon fennel puree was going to have a strong fennel flavor, but fortunately it didn't.  Third Course - Dessert  - Sticky Toffee Pudding: This was my first time trying sticky toffee pudding, so I can't make any comparisons. All I can say is that it was an incredibly sweet dessert when the ice cream, moist cake, and caramel sauce are combined.   Service - Terrific.   Overall - I'm still on the fence about this place, considering how my last visit was horrendous and this one was great. If it wasn't for their Restaurant Week menu, I probably wouldn't have given Pub & Grill a second shot.",

I have to give them  credit for constantly trying to improve and not just live off the \"hype\".  The food was very good. It was very expensive (2 burgers, 1 fries, special fries dip , 1 desert and 2 soft drinks $75 after tip. But hey, we're in Vegas, everything is jacked up sky high.   The burgers were a little small and I could have easily had 2 of them. But the price pulled that off the table.  I think it's more of a bucket list thing. We always loved his shows and wanted to say we are there.   The presentation and decor was beautiful.   Would we do it again ? probably not. Are we glad we did it this time? Definitely yes.

For my lunch I selected to the Pub Chopped Salad which I loved. Everything in the salad was finely diced so I did not need to use my knife, and the dressing was light and evenly distributed.   The only downside to the pub was the seating. I was on a low chair by a large coffee table and it was incredibly uncomfortable to eat from that angle (and thank goodness I wasn't wearing a skirt!)",

Last night my family and I (party of 10) went in for dinner, no reservations however we were seated under a 10-15 minute wait so that's no a problem.  Once we were seated our server greeted us and continued to inform us about all the special/ best sellers and her personal favorite dishes/drinks.  We ordered the chip nachos appetizer and those were delicious, even tho there were burnt pieces (and I mean BURNT pieces of chips.. they were black..)   Here's where thinks went downhill.  4 of us ordered the famous fish n chips. As I started eating, I noticed the puddle of oil under the chips that were coming from the fish.  Half if not all my chips were soaked in oil and were therefore soggy.. fish was okay.. honestly I wasn't blown away. My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and he LOVES GORDON RAMSAY. As he ate the burger he said the burger was pretty much a Chili's or TGIF burger.. and expressed how disappointing it was.  Although the restaurant is pricey, the price wouldn't matter if the food lived up to the standard that Gordon holds. 2 thumbs down.",

Was not terribly hungry and took the servers recommendation of the Lobster Roll.  When it came it looked inviting but sadly it was served on stale bread lightly toasted with a meager amount of lobster.  Took several bites, waiting for the magical bite.... it wasn't there.  Sent it back and settled for Hummus.  Clearly this restaurant does NOT uphold the standard you expect from the name on the sign.",

    "text": "Bucket List Disappointment  Less than thrilled about the dinner but the service was very good. Eating at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants was a bucket list item so on my recent vacation to Las Vegas we went to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  I was so disappointed.  I ordered what was named a Classic Ramsey Beer Braised Short Ribs, 1st the order came out in less than 5 minutes... before our drinks and everything was ice cold; the rib, potato puree and vegetables.  Our waiter caught on very quickly that the food came out very fast and asked if it was ok.  I told him it was ice cold and he returned it right away.  The re-fire order came with minimal sauce on the short rib, the puree had small lumps and the vegetables tasted under cooked but like they were cooked in oil that was not hot enough because they were greasy.  I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsey through his recipes and TV shows.  Quality seems to be #1 for his brand, however Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill did not have quality control in the kitchen as a priority.  Since I did not eat much for dinner and we had traveled so far to get to Vegas we ordered dessert.  Our waiter recommended the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The waiter was wonderful, because I have a nut allergy he had them make the dessert with the brittle on the side.  I have to admit that I am not a dessert person but that had to be the best tasting dessert I ever had.  Keep in mind it is very sweet.  I shared the dessert with my mother and we were only able to eat half, but it is worth tasting at least once in life.  Because I went for dinner and not dessert I would not return. Another item crossed off my bucket list but I am so disappointed.",

The egg was soft boiled and wrapped in thinly sliced beef and dipped in a flour batter and baked...it was served with balsamic caramelize onions and some micro greens...all I can say is that the photo I included, does not do it justice, as it was layered with different textures and flavors, and I loved the kick and zing of the tasty mustard sauce.  Adam, the server, was terrific, and knew all of  the ingredients of the Ramsay tonic and the Scotch Egg, and enthusiastically explained how they were made. He was also personable a friendly, and I appreciated his interest in what I thought of each dish.  The Shepherd's pie was good after adding a bit of salt and pepper. Made of ground lamb, carrots and peas in a mild sauce, it came piped on top with creamy mashed potatoes. As a basic meat and potatoes type of dish, it was filling, however, I do not think I will order it again, as, to me, there just was not a lot of flavour going on in the dish. I think next time I will try the Ramsay signature fish and chips.  I decided to order the sticky toffee for dessert, as I had heard so much about it.., and Wow! Was it ever good! It was so creamy and delicious with a moist date cake base, topped with a sweet cream ice cream and Florentine cookie, that I almost wanted to order another.  Adam came table side, and slowly drizzled the luscious warm toffee syrup over the top. This dessert together with rich hot coffee, was such a perfect ending to a tasty adventure in Gordon Ramsay's Grill and Pub!",

Really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. Just dimly light enough so that it was intimate, and the servers were very nice and helpful. Our waiter was top-notch - and he even offered to connect us with a promoter for night clubs. The 3 stars is for the food, though. I sampled the pesto chicken sandwich and lamb shepherd's pie. Both were good, but nothing really wowed me. Some other friends tried the maple sage fried chicken sandwich, which they said was delicious (it looked delicious too).   To summarize, I was slightly disappointed dining at my second Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However, the food is decent according to Vegas standards, as you'll end up paying around ~$30 after tax and tip.",

    "text": "I was so excited to come here! Gordon Ramsay is my idol! That's why I am so heartbroken to give this place 2 stars. My star rating metric is at the bottom of this review.  Ambiance: This place looks amazing! It's got a very modern and sleek design and I loved it!  The Price: Get your wallets ready because there's a big price attached to this place. I was prepared for it and I didn't flinch because it's a Ramsay restaurant. I'm paying premium prices for high quality food. Entrees ran around $27-$30, sandwiches around $20-25, starters anywhere from $8-$20, and sides around $12. Unfortunately, the value was extremely lacking. The portions were fine, but the quality was terrible.  The Food: This was the biggest disappointment I've had in a very long time.   My fiance ordered the Bangers and Mash. It's Ramsay and it's a British pub so I'm thinking you can't possibly screw this up.... wrong! I was actually INSULTED at what we received for the $30. They served dehydrated potatoes. Guys... even chilis bar and grill serves me real potatoes when they serve mash! When I'm served dehydrated potatoes at $30 a meal that is Unacceptable. Period. There's an expectation of value and quality that comes with that name and that price.  He sent it back for Fish and Chips. This meal was acceptable... not excellent, delicious, amazing, or worth the cost of the $30. It means he ate it without issues. That's not good enough for a Ramsay place. Do better!  I ordered the Chicken Tikki. I was assured that they used Ramsay's recipe for this dish, which may be why I was satisfied. My dish was good. The chicken was well proportioned and well seasoned. I had just enough naan for all my chicken and just enough yogurt to blend well with the tikki sauce. The down side of my dish was the rice. It was boxed rice with very little seasoning and it was not cooked properly.. While I can say that this dish was good and recommend it (aside from the rice), I can't say that it was head and shoulders above anywhere else. My local place is almost as good as this. Ramsay's tikki should be incomparable.   I wanted to try the Mac and cheese because I know it's one of Ramsay's signatures but I'm allergic to lobster. Luckily, there was a starter option called Little Mac. There are a few flavor options and I went for the Jalapeno Bacon option. The predominant flavor of the dish was jalapeno, not cheese. The cheese was such a subtle flavor that it felt more like texture than a main component. I did not taste cheese. The noodles were cooked better than the rice but overall I'd say this dish was just okay.  The Speed: There are a couple speed components here - kitchen and service. I'll address Kitchen first and talk about service as my final piece. Too fast! I know Ramsay is all about speed and this is great! You don't want to wait forever for your food! However.... you DO want fresh food made to order at a place with Gordon Ramsay in the name of the restaurant. My Mac and cheese came out maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. Sure, ok... it's a starter so I'll be lenient. The noodles were likely precooked to al dente to speed the process. However, our meals came out within seconds of my starter being presented to me. WAY too fast!! No way do fresh bangers AND tikki chicken come out that quickly if they were made to order. Simply not possible. This made me feel extremely rushed... I picked the starter with the intention of having time to enjoy it before my meal came out because the flavors don't mix without time to cleanse your palate. On top of that, it made me feel as if all our food had been pre-made in morning prep then stuck in microwaves when it was ordered. This is what I'd expect of a chain restaurant... NOT what I'd expect of a $30 entree attached to the name Gordon Ramsay. How disappointing.   The Service: Our server was Michael. He was the one redeeming factor of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry, and over the past 10 years have been both a cook and a server, and his service truly blew me away. It's so rare these days to find a server like him. He struck the perfect balance of being approachable without hovering, made menu recommendations with ease, and never let our glasses empty before refilling. He handled the sent back dish smoothly and without making us feel awkward about it. If only the back of house was as phenomenal as the service!!  Overall this place has received 2/5 stars, with the ambiance and service keeping it from a 1 star review.  1 - Hated. Avoid!! 2 - Meh. Bored by it. Nothing special. 3 - Enjoyed while there but won't leave lasting impression. 4 - Really loved this place. Recommend it! 5 - Law of diminishing returns does not apply!",

He's a genius and I've never run up a bar tab like that or been happier for it. We had a great time and it's a highlight for our trip.",

We also had the butter chicken curry, which came with Saffron Basmati rice, yogurt & naan bread. The aromas and flavors created from the spices were excellent. The spices were bold and its taste really stood out in the curry. The curry chicken was great with the naan bread and yogurt dip.

The pork belly was juicy, fatty and had a crispy outer layer of skin that gives a loud crunch when biting very similar to the skin on thick cuts of deep fried chicharron. However the meat was a lot softer and more flavorful.  The highlight of the three was the Steak & Ale pie. The steak chunks, the puree, the mushrooms, and the crust...simply delicious. As good as the other two plates were, we should have just ordered two pies due to how fast we ate it. One of my friends is a very very picky eater and he ate the bulk of it.   A Yelp check-in gets you a complimentary order of sticky toffee pudding. It comes pipping hot so careful when digging in. A tasty hot sponge cake and melted ice cream combo.  Third time visiting and enjoyed it as equally as past visits. Keep the good food coming!  Lunch 1/27/2018",

    "text": "Wow for the prices that this place charges the quality and flavor is just completely unacceptable.   We ordered the beef hash poutine to start and the gravy was way overly salty. Fries tasted like they were previously frozen and didn't taste fresh.   We also got the short rib dish and the chicken curry. The short to rib was decent but too much fat was left on the rib which the texture took away from the enjoyment of eating the dish. Also again it was too salty. Then the chicken curry was supposed to be like an Indian dish and the chicken was dry and stringy as well as the rice was under cooked and dry. The naan definitely wasn't real naan.   Overall a complete disappointment. Would not visit again.",

Our waiter was nice and helpful but after taking our drink/appetizer order and then main course order, we didn't see him again.  I literally had to get up and track him down to get our check, which is the only reason I couldn't give more than 3 stars. I kind of got the feeling that he wasn't going to waste too much of his time on a couple only getting some burgers for lunch.  The food though was phenomenal! We started with the short rib kettle chip nachos and they were delicious. Then we split the lobster and shrimp rolls and the corned beef poutine.  Both were great, not a detail ignored in the food at all.  I always like to try a place twice, so second time around I am hoping for better service.  Overall, just know when you go, the food will be excellent.",

We started off lunch with the pork belly appetizer. The pork itself was prepared well, the meat was still fatty and juicy and the skin had a nice crisp to it. I personally thought it fell short when it came down to flavor though. My girlfriend enjoyed it, however.  We also ordered the brisket sandwich and braised short rib.  The sandwich was actually really good considering the fact that I'm not really a sandwich type guy. The sourdough was hearty, soft, with a nice crust, and flavorful. The brisket wasn't too salty and the sauerkraut and sauce worked well with every bite.  The short rib was probably my favorite though. The rib was incredibly tender and the meat would fall off with just a push with the fork.  Even though the meal started off on the wrong direction with the appetizer, the main entrees helped redeem our meal and we left pretty satisfied... except for the soda water. Sparkling water is $5 just as a heads up.",

First off, we started with and appetizer order of pretzels.  When they came out, they were luke warm at best. Immediately, after the pretzels came out, our main course came out. So much for having an appetizer before dinner. Anyways, I ordered the Bangers and Mash and my wife got a basic cheeseburger. I wonder how the food came out so quickly. Could the food have been pre-cooked? My Bangers and Mash was ok....the potatoes were good, the sausage was ok. The burger my wife got was terrible. Zero flavor, dry and downright boring....for the cost I would expect much better. I feel like we could have had a better burger at Smashburger. I am disappointed in this restaurant and the value for the food. I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here....i have eaten at other GR restaurants in Vegas and this by far was the worst. I hope GR takes a serious look at this place. It might be time to sent the kitchen staff upstairs, Hell's Kitchen style.",

The sausage was perfectly cooked and the sauce/gravy went well with the mashed potatoes that also tasted really good.  However....... was it worth 20 bucks? Probably not.   The rest of our party had a bunch of various dishes. I remember the pub beef burger being a popular one among our group. No one really seemed blown away by it. Again 20 bucks.   I got the notion that a burger at Smashburger might be around the same caliber as the ones my friends were eating judging by their reactions when eating.  The duck confit poutine was OK. It was interesting, but there was definitely a lot more fries and cheese than any duck. I wish there was more duck since it actually tasted decent.  The bottom line here: the food is 'good', but not really worth it. The ambiance is nice, but the service is also hit or miss. Pretend you're that guy at a busy bar trying to order a drink for you and your friends. It's hard to get the bartender's attention right? That's probably what you're going to feel like when you try and get your waiter/waitress' attention.  I think knocking 50% off the menu prices would be appropriate for the food that you'll be eating. Gordon Ramsay is a baller chef, but since he's not actually cooking the food, I have no problem dissing the restaurant and saying it's not worth the price.",

They gave us a great table and their service was fabulous! We all had burgers! I had the lamb burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had! We ordered the pretzel stick appetizer for my son and he totally loved it. I was so relieved that they were accommodating consider we had a toddler with us. I'm a huge Gordon fan and having a great experience at one of his restaurants made me love him even more!",

    "text": "Really? This restaurant bears the name of Gordon Ramsey? Actually, more closely resembles Amy's Baking Kitchen. How can he have any credibility judging and criticizing the food of others when his establishment serves such horrible food?  Now I wanna say that the service was excellent and the staff very warm. Drinks were large as they should be for the price. Apps were okay. Onion soup was awesome and vegetable salad solid. But the entrees were absolutely horrible. I had the pork belly and could only get through a  bite. It was too fatty and oily, without flavor!   I'm shocked that for the money and considering all the great good alternatives, how can this place stay in business? Should have just gone to Nobu and spent $50 more!",

The chips seemed like standard wedges you'd get anywhere (the pea-mint mash was interesting). Wife ordered short ribs which she found just average. We were looking for something spectacular food-wise from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant however the most spectacular thing here was the pricing  ($30 for bland fish & chips of a quality that I can get equal or better at 30 other places in LV). Service was good, ambiance pleasant, just underwhelmed by the food...pubs aren't scarce in LV and have had much better pub food at several different LV establishments. If at Caesars, I'd take Mesa hands down (from the more casual celebrity chef restaurants).",

    "text": "Wow. I hope whoever wins Hell's Kitchen hasn't taken over as executive chef of this place yet because that would mean that Ramsay made a bad choice. If what we experienced happened during dinner service on that show, someone would have been kicked out of the kitchen.   My boyfriend tried to order a beer, but we were told they were out of it and the server couldn't really recommend a comparable choice. So he gave us what felt like 15 minutes to choose another beer and then came back for our order.   I ordered the chopped salad, Leo got the Shepard's pie and we share the pub chips. Everything was just OK. The chopped salad mentioned wood-grilled chicken, but what I got resembled shredded rotisserie chicken - pretty bland. And then midway through our meal, we got bread service - which made absolutely no sense.   Leo ordered another beer and after our meal, we asked for the dessert menu. And watched our server schmooze with a larger party for 10 minutes before we could flag him down and ask again. Once we got the menu and picked out a dessert (Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was actually very good), we had to wait until another server tapped ours on the back to let him know we were waiting.   By the time we finished everything, nearly two hours had passed and the place was pretty much dead. It may have just been because we had a poor server that night, but we would never go back to this place.",

The cocktails were good too, but.... the beer flight....just do it. The food was excellent, we decided we would order a few different options and share them around the table. We had the Lobster & Shrimp Rolls (one HUNDRED stars), the Mini Pub Burgers (you'd think once you've had a few sliders you've had 'em all, but you thought wrong; these were da bomb), the Deviled Eggs, the Fish and Chips, and the Hellfire Wings (the only thing we ordered that were average, but I mean, I still ate them all, so...), and you already know we sprung the calorie bank for dessert. Worth. It. We came back the next day for lunch and saw a different hostess, same bad attitude, but we this time we sat at the bar. The food was again awesome and the bartender, for an afternoon bartender, was hilarious. 5 stars!!! I don't love going to Vegas but I sure love going here!",

The service was excellent, and although I didn't particularly enjoy the ambiance of sitting at the edge of the casino, I'm sure you could sit more 'in' the restaurant to enjoy it more.   That being said, the scallop dish with potato and bacon moat under it was heavenly. Each bite on its own was wonderful, but combined wax a little symphony in your mouth with each bite. The shepherds pie is good (if you like lamb), but the Caesar salad was just average.   This is a great option to try some of Chef Ramsay's food influence and ideas without using hearing protection & dropping a mortgage payment over at Steak.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to dinner here the other night. Fantastic. We made reservations because we had read about long waits. We arrived and we're seated in minutes. I read some reviews that said that they staggered seating. I didn't see this happen. The tables that were empty for a bit seemed to be for larger parties with reservations. We also didn't have a long wait for our food. Waiting time, all around, was average.   My husband had the lamb shank and I had the lamb rack. Both were delicious. The lamb rack comes with a couscous that is to die for. The sides not listed with your dinner come at extra cost. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. To be fair, the sides probably come at an extra cost because you don't need rhem. We both would have been full and satisfied with just our meals. Our helpings were pretty large. We struggled to finish the extra side.   As a side note, I ordered my lamb rack medium and it came almost well done. This didn't bother me at all, since the only reason I didn't order it well is that we'll usually translates to burnt at most places. So I was perfectly satisfied with what I was served.   There is a photographer that will ask if you want your picture taken at dinner. She comes around about 20 minutes later to show you the picture. You get three and a frame for like $18. She also stated that she worked for ceasears and does this at all of the restaurants and attractions within the hotel. So, no matter where you go in ceasears it seems this will happen. You can always say no and she will leave. She in no way pressured us into getting or buying our pictures.   We also ended with dessert, because we were waiting for our pictured. We ate the pear cobbler, which was warm and gooey. It came with a sweat cream which evened out the dish very well.   The only complaint I have about the night was that the chairs (not the stools) are pretty low compared to the tablw. I felt like a toddler trying to reach everything, no matter how close I got to the table.   Other than that, great and interesting place! Would definitely eat here again if I was given the choice!",

    "text": "We went to GR's P&G this afternoon for lunch and, I won't ask forgiveness for being blunt, this place was absolutely terrible and the only black mark on an otherwise perfect tour of Vegas' fantastic dining experiences.   I must also say that we have very forgiving natures when it comes to restaurants, and that neither of us are food snobs; we simply like good food, whether it's from a proper gastro-pub or from a fine restaurant. This of course was neither.   I ordered the little sliders (I forget already what they called them, having all day tried to repress the memories). I don't mind paying good money for good food or for good quantities. These sliders fit none of those descriptions. Each was as small as a silver dollar, greasier than anything from a proper pub, and to be quite honest flavourless save for the strong garlic butter the came with. A \"plate\" of three of them cost 14 dollars. The \"chips\" were greasier than a fast food place, were not crisp, and flavourless to match the sliders. These little greese-bars were nine dollars alone.   My charming companion tried the shepherd's pie. Being the verbally generous thing she is, she could only say that the dish wasn't terrible. A 22 dollar bowl of tripe is not what you'd expect from a fancy chef's establishment. Having tasted the pie myself, I could not be so forgiving in my description as her, nor could I really come up with something intelligent and so instead made, I think, an awkward face upon tasting it.   The one thing I will say was pleasant was the service. The hostess was very friendly, and the server was rather attentive and pleasant. This, combined with the fact we were terribly hungry when we arrived, was the only thing stopping us from walking out.   Again, I must point out that I am not snobbish when it comes to food. This place was terrible for cheap food, let alone for something this expensive. In our time at Vegas, I have eaten fantastic burgers at \"I Heart Burger\", \"The Grand Lux Cafe\", and KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers\" . . . Each of these phenomenal burgers were cheaper than my tiny little sliders and had flavors I cannot even describe. If you feel the need for a good burger, I would recommend any of those.   I feel I must end this review on a positive remark . . . their little symbol of the Union Flag within an English Bulldog was cute.",

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.....literally a tale of two lunch sittings..lol  GR Pub & Grill Ambiance and Service:  English Pub & grill decor throughout the restaurant is well designed from the murals to the details in the uniform and even place settings.  The whole resto is as big as a small warehouse so there's plenty of seating in tables and booths.   We booked 2 reservations online and the hostess desk was great with getting both parties once we checked in.  Our server was on point, tried his best but the floor wasn't staffed correctly for a busy Friday lunch rush.  It looked like him and another server was covering about 50 covers/customers in our table section.  The kitchen took about 30 minutes to get our appetizers, 30 Minutes for the entrees and 20 minutes for the desserts.  This was a 2 hour lunch.  Our other party seated at the front were already ordering dessert while we had not received our main entrees yet.  GR Pub & Grill cuisine:  The deviled eggs were yum and made for another great appetizer.  The tomato soup was tasty and definitely something I'd order again.  The beef wellington comes out one way, medium rare and flavorful.  It was a small serving but packed lots of flavor.  The pigs in the blanket came with full sized sausages which was a win.  The sticky toffee pudding was definitely the star of the meal, absolutely delicious and not too sweet in flavor.  All the dishes I sampled were savory and everyone was happy with their dishes  I don't know why one group received fast efficient service while the other group/my group had time issues.  Overall the food was good but service is very inconsistent and you expect more for a $$$ restaurant  Hopefully they're better on my next visit.  Enjoy!",

We originally made reservations at first because it was my birthday weekend and we didn't want to wait for to long. Good thing we did because there was quite a wait even with our reservations. After waiting for maybe 5-10 minutes we were seated promptly.   I feel like our server's name was Chris.. Either way he was awesome and very attentive. We started off with the Hellfire wings. Now, I usually don't order wings because the amount of meat I waste on them is atrocious. I usually take one-two bites as I don't like to chomp on the bone. However, these wings are my absolute favorite thing of my birthday weekend in Vegas. The sauce was delicious, I wish I ordered the full size. Even the blue cheese was incredibly creamy and yummy.. And I usually hate blue cheese dressing! Even half way through the wings you knew it would be a good dinner.  The mains didn't disappoint either. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I went with the tenderloin with a side of Asparagus. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the fish and chips and found it incredibly filling. My steak was like butter! It melted in my mouth and it didn't even need the sauce It came with (I went with peppercorn) However, the sauce did add a different depth of taste. The asparagus were pretty big and they were seasoned nicely. Who knew Asparagus could be so good, even with the drizzle of the Bearnaise sauce. All together the dishes were amazing! I legit still think about the wings to this day and would love the recipe to the sauce, been trying to Google it.  Now the sever was amazing, he overheard it was my birthday and instead of us having to order the sticky toffee pudding, we received a free one. The cute part? It was topped with a birthday candle. The dessert was amazing. However, we were unable to finish it simply because we were just to full.   This place is a definite must visit when in Vegas and you want some good food!",

    "text": "First and foremost, shout out to the staff. Our hostess was very nice and shared a short convo set the mood to a good vibe as we sat down. Next we met our server Joe... personal shout out to Joe. He nailed it. Amazingly friendly and never did I have to worry about my drink. Always beat me to s refill. Love the environment.    I love calamari the most as an appetizer. Personally nothing beats it. So naturally we had to try his out. In doing so, this calamari has to be one of the best I have tried to date. This calamari from the pub is huge!!! The rings are fairly sized and in the Centre is all the tentacles as a whole, fried!! All of it had great taste but the rings are really the. Eat grabs I will have to say. The tentacles might be a little much for some people but it's just a different mix of the same tastes.   Ordered the burger myself and got it done medium for a big switch up from the usual  way from a restaurant being a well done burger. As far as size goes the burger is massive. A good amount of bacon on top of the juiciest burger I have ever seen on top of vegetables. What a sight. Again the bun does the same thing as it does at his burger joint. It so soft it literally almost melts in front of your eyes.    Took the first bite and instantly regretted not getting it medium at his burger restaurant. The volume of juices that contain mad amounts of flavors from the patty is huge. Mix in the crunch from the bacon and it's taste and holy god damn. The bacon helps to absorb some of the overflow of juices along with the bun!!      Can't make this up. A perfect bite burger. Each bite as tasty or slight variations in taste from the next or previous bite that result in my new favorite pick for a burger to date.     The fries on side surprised me just as much. Very loud on the taste and the garlic aioli on the side makes for flavors that punch nicely.     For the medicated or just burger fans. This a must have. Little of a walk (but what isn't) will allow one to walk off how full they will be",

    "text": "Gordon, you must try your own butter chicken plate.  Chicken was dry and lacked butter curry sauce and was a bit flavorless.  The nann bread is no where near authentic and bland.  The rice was average.  I also tried the macaroni and was far from impressed.  The spinach cheese side was pretty good though.  I guess i went in with really high expectations because i know you are very critical when it come to quality.  I was shocked with the quality and at a premium price.  Please check your kitchen as something is not happening in there.  Hope this feedback helps",

    "text": "Disclaimer: this review is only for the bar! Unfortunately I can't speak on the food other than the sticky toffee pudding dessert because that was the main attraction for me during my visit to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. My friend and I came here around 3pm on a Saturday and was told it would be about a 15 minute wait to be seated so we grabbed a seat at the bar instead. We ordered a couple of mocktails between the two of us and shared a sticky toffee pudding dessert. I know what you're thinking - \"you sat at the bar to drink a non-alcoholic drink and eat dessert?\" I sho did. The bartender was super personable and we got really great service.   The sticky toffee pudding was nothing short of amazing! Albeit a little sweeter than I'm used to but hey, that's toffee. They wait until they bring it to you to actually drizzle on the sauce. It came out fresh and warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The cake was moist and the sauce just added the rich sugary sweetness to it. You definitely want a little bit of that ice cream with each bite to balance out the toffee pudding. All the elements put together make one decadent dessert. Don't let it sit for too long because it tastes best warm...but honestly I can't imagine why you wouldn't devour it within minutes anyways. If I had one complaint it would be the scoop of ice cream was too small.",

    "text": "After walking all day up and down the strip, my friend and I found ourselves inside Caesars Palace looking for a place where we can rest our painful feet and have a drink or two. What do you know? Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill happens to be right in front of us, so we decided to come in.  The bar was pretty full from end to end. But we were lucky enough to find two open seats almost all the way to the left end so we sat there. After perusing the menu, we asked for something familiar: 35 oz Blue Moon. My friend wanted something to munch so he ordered some hummus with naan bread.  - Beer: 35 oz of ice cold Blue Moon poured just right? Can't go wrong with that. - Hummus:  nothing special. Tasted just like regular bar hummus to me despite the Gordon Ramsay name. The hummus I've had at my local (HTX) Persian restaurants are all way better. - Bartender: Compared to all the other bartenders that we saw working other areas of the bar, our bartender just seemed so uptight. No smile, no small talks, no attempts to connect. He gave us the menu, took our orders, and left. He did occasionally come back to check on us, but again, he did so with a blank stare on his face sans smile. Meh.",

First off it was super busy so just be aware and it is loud so you won't get a super quiet atmosphere but the place was super nice.  Food we got an assortment of food I decided to go with the sampler or whatever it is called got the scallops which were amazing!!! Beef Wellington good and the dessert was sticky toffee pudding oh goodness so good! (Got another one for free by checking in on yelp!!)  We also got pork belly, lobster Mac and cheese, steak and ale pie, pub burgers!  All the food was soo good and all the meat was tender!!!  The steak and ale pie was an amazing pot pie! Mac and cheese was super creamy and flavorful!  Over all everything was delicious and definitely worth coming! We were there for almost 3 hours though with service and waiting on checks.   It was not cheap either I think the total bill was well over 300 just a heads up but worth the experience!",

I was tempted to try the Beef Wellington but didn't want to spend that kind of money on something I wasn't sure about. Too bad they don't have samples. I decided to go with the Cheeseburger and fries. I loved the burger.  It was as good as I hoped it would be and the fries were great.  Maybe I'll splurge on our next Vegas trip and try the $57 Beef Wellington.   This restaurant is inside Caesars Palace in the casino so it is more casual than his other restaurants. It's a great place to hang out and enjoy great food and drinks. The service was good and the staff was friendly.",

So we had high standards coming into this experience.    We give it a 3 relative to the 2 other celebrity dinner experiences that had while visiting.  Mesa grill was better and the other unnamed was much worse.    Beautiful ambiance, well done on decorating and bringing a fun Vegas style English pub experience to Vegas   We walked 30 minutes to get there... Vegas baby...  it took 15 minutes to get water on our table after sitting.  It was warm, no ice, and the worst tasting of our trip. We splurged on a $10 bottle of chilled water since getting ice was an elusive task.  The Caesar salad was a real disappointment...  no cracked peppercorn, and even though it was coated with dressing it lacked any real flavor.  It's only savior was  the fresh parmigiana shavings.   The braised pork rib was fantastic and we enjoyed every bite of it... but the cheddar mashed potato had no cheddar and no temperature.   The beef Wellington was good but not great.  The smear of sauce that accompanied it was gone in 2 bites (the best 2 bites of the meal). After waiting for more sauce the beef was as cold as the potatoes that it arrived with.    Dessert was amazing...  we had the sticky toffee pudding it it was a delight.  Great to end on such a strong note.    If Gordon has come disguised to this restaurant as he has to so many others. He might not have been as nice in his comments as we have. We enjoyed the experience but left wanting a better experience from our favorite chef.",

The roasted Scottish Salmon was flavorful and cooked perfectly and moist throughout. Quick and attentive service. No complaints at all.",

The ambiance was kind of cool, hip and trendy--one wall made completely of stack beer kegs--but at times the decor kind of felt a little forced.  I had the fish and chips---classic right?  Unfortunately I felt the fish missed the mark in flavor.  No doubt it was light and crisp, but just lacked character to it---as Gordon would say--bland.  I might try it out again for another menu option at some point, but it's not high on my list.",

    "text": "After walking around the strip for a few hours, my friend and I decided we were both hungry and wanted to try something new for a change. I've always wanted to try one of Chef Ramsay's restaurants so I figured lets try the Pub and Grill. I must say I had very high expectations for this place because I always watch Chef Ramsay on TV, but I  was not too impressed with the food.   I ordered the lamb burger as suggested by the waiter, and I could not get myself to think that it was better than any other lamb burgers I have had. It had all the good elements of a burger, but it was very similar to the burgers I've had in the past. The best part was that it had a nice balanced flavor and was well complimented with the sauce. Nothing special though.  I also had some of the pan roasted airline chicken. My qualms with this dish is that the serving of chicken was really small. Also, the bed of white beans was all that was on the dish besides the chicken. The presentation was very bleh and the beans were flavorless. It became difficult to eat after awhile as it was very redundant especially because the chicken was quite flavorless as well. For the price, i thought it was the least appealing.  For the side, I decided to go with the mushrooms and poached egg. This was probably the best thing I had. It was the best poached egg I've ever tasted. Also, the mushrooms had a nice texture.   I really think that this place is pretty good depending on what you get. My experience with some of the dishes were not altogether \"wow\"ing but maybe it was because I hyped myself up because it was a restaurant owned by a world class chef. So, If you do go here, I recommend asking for the popular items, that way you can sort of filter out what is sought after, rather than waste your money on something you can go somewhere else for for cheaper;",

The food was just OK and the beer selection was limited.  We ordered Deviled Egg, Shepherd's Pie (lamb) and Fish and Chips.  The Shepherd's Pie was tasty and moist.  The Fish and Chips had crispy batter.  I poured that malt vinegar all over my fish and chips though.  I had the Pub Crawl cocktail which was good, but my husband complained about the limited draft beer selection considering it was supposed to be a pub.   I would dine here for the experience.",

This, sadly, includes a horrible smell at the bar that is reminiscent of pubs that need a good clean.  The service was great. The staff at the door & the bar were friendly, helpful and highly recommended. The drinks menu is good too and the Bar Crawl cocktail was delicious. We sat at the bar as there was a 30 minute wait for a table at 19:15 on a Saturday evening (to be expected). This was fine and made for a great experience as we got to chat to the bar staff and watch some sports on tv.  We ordered the lamb burger, cheese burger, cauliflower cheese and sprouts. It was all cold and my cheese burger was really dry and inedible. I sent it back as I just couldn't eat it. It was so poor we didn't want to risk ordering dessert. I think GR would go mad if he came here on Kitchen Nightmares and tried the food! He needs to sort it out or take his name off it. Do not come here. It's really poor.",

    "text": "SHUT IT DOWN!  I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable.   The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table.   She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond.   She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?  First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us.   On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?  Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay.   At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, \"the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!\" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners.   My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone.   I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?  I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them.   Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is True then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?  I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.",

The waitress mentioned that it was restaurant week and there was a special which included a salad, entree and a dessert. I had a Caesar salad, shepherd's pie with another side salad, a caramel cake dessert and to drink a pint of Guinness. My wife also had a Caesar salad, the chicken curry with rice and naan, for dessert creme brulee and to drink a fruity cocktail. We were both satisfied with the salad but had problems with our entrees. My shepherd's pie was way too salty and my wife's meal, the chicken curry with rice, which was also salty, had rice that tasted stale and had an unpleasant smell.  My wife enjoy the creme brulee. I had the caramel cake dessert. I was dissatisfied with the taste of the cake. It was very bland and the caramel sauce and ice cream just masked the distastefulness of the cake. I ended up throwing it away.  This was the first time I've eaten at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and I was expecting something more than what I got. If I'm to return, it'll only be for the Guinness.",

Nothing was done and we were made to feel that it wasn't possible that the food would be a source of his very violent illness. Really unfortunate, unappealing experience lacking standards.",

We didn't want to spend too much money since we had mistakenly come to Caesar's looking for Ramsey's BURGR and decided to eat here since we were starving.  We were seated behind the wall of beer kegs which was awkward since the table was raised and we were technically sharing the table with another group on the other side. The table was also weirdly wide and the place was noisy so we couldn't have much conversation. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and I had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is a side dish. The fish and chips was surprisingly big. The fish was well seasoned and still moist. With the tartar sauce they tasted really good. The fries were also nice and crisp and well seasoned. The house made ketchup was really good. The lobster Mac n' cheese was a bit underwhelming. The noodles were a nice al dente and the bechamel sauce was rich and creamy but I was expecting more lobster for the price (ridiculously $21). And it was still side dish size. I had maybe 1 small piece of  lobster for every 7 bites which is too small a ratio to call it lobster Mac n' cheese if you ask me! Also could have used more cheese, but I guess that's personal preference.   For the pub atmosphere and the pub quality grub, Ramsey should definitely consider lowering the prices.",

Either that or some people get some kind of weird thrill out of nitpicking celeb restaurants rather than reviewing honestly) We ended up here Christmas Eve after deciding that the 4 hour wait for Bacchanal wasn't putting us in the holiday mood. We asked for specific seating (not  wanting to sit at the pub tables) and received it with a smile.  We started with the pork and duck rillettes, which were delicious and well prepared. Our table of 3 had the hangar steak, the scallops and the pork belly with the baby carrots and potato puree to share. Steak was flavorful and tender (the server did suggest my Mom order it no more done than medium which was a good call), the scallops were very well done and the pork belly was yummy. Desserts were beyond good. We had the triple chocolate trifle, the pear crumble and the spotted dog. Total for our table with 3 entrees, 2 sides, 1 app, 3 desserts, 2 glasses of wine and bottled water was $240. Service was impeccable and friendly. This is pub food at its best. English pubs, by the way, are not known for huge menus, so to expect a Cheesecake Factory type menu here is ridiculous. It is actually a fairly extensive menu for a pub. Prices were in line with other casino restaurants of the same pedigree.",

    "text": "GR has three restaurants in Vegas, and I've been to 2/3 of them -- BurGr (that's another review). Anyways I had high hopes for this place since Gordon Ramsay is known as that judge that insults people for messing dishes up. He needs to come to this location and train these cooks... better yet insult them. KIDDING. When I took a bite out of my Butter Chicken Curry, it was very bland, along with the saffron rice. Curry and saffron rice are supposed to be flavorful, which they both lacked.. I guess I shouldn't have expected a strong flavor of curry since this is a pub & grill... BUT its GORDON RAMSAY! Why put it on the menu if its not a dish you specialize in. Note: the menu is pretty limited with signature dishes.  My bf got the fish and chips with peas, and that was just okay as well... IDK if it was an off day or what, but everything felt under-salted. The experience there was also meh, service was just OK,  the waiter asked us how our mixed greens salad was, and never checked up on us when we got our entree's.   Fortunately, there was a good ending to our meal, which was the sticky toffee pudding -- it comes with caramel sauce and vanilla ice-cream (ice cream was the best part) and that kind of made up for the lack of flavor from our dishes, it's really sweet, but the vanilla ice cream gave it a nice balance.  Would I come back?  Only if GR himself were there.",

Buffalo wings were some of the best I've had; meaty & not overly acidic (HH pricing was a plus.) Two out of three cheeses on charcuterie platter were of the blue variety, which two out of the three of us didn't appreciate!   Steak & Ale Pie was blanketed in a buttery, golden crust & had a generous amount of fork-tender beef, mushrooms, & root veggies in a salty gravy. His ribeye looked slightly overcooked, he called it \"buffet quality\" (I get it, we're at a pub not a steakhouse, but a $45 steak shouldn't disappoint.) She had bangers & mash & liked the variety of sausages except for the chicken, which had little flavor.   Dessert was a heavenly, decadent Sticky Toffee Pudding and a lighter Eaton Mess with berries.

Also the peppersauce was missing the special kick and the broussel sprouts were swimming in oil. On the bright side, the service was excellent at all times.

Hell's Kitchen was booked so we continued our walk to Gordon's Pub & Grill. We arrived on time for our reservation and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was almost to capacity and had a very loud vibe to it as it is open to the casino floor inside Caesar's Palace.  Almost 10 minutes passed before our waitress checked in and once she made it to the table she walked us thru a few different drink options.  We ordered 2 drinks from the bar and proceeded to wait another several minutes. The menu was awesome. There were so many great choices it was difficult to decide on a starter and even what to have for dinner.  Many of us all ordered the Beef Wellington and it truly did not disappoint. It was cooked to perfection and we well seasoned. Our waitress did a nice job checking in to make sure we all had everything we needed.  Overall it was a good experience. My only critical feeling about the entire place was feeling like I was sitting in the middle of the casino floor having dinner. Otherwise I recommend the restaurant and will return in April with another group.",

I had visited this restaurant once prior during the CES Show and thought it was ok. On Saturday evening at about 9PM no wait to speak of so we thought we'd give this a try. I shared the Fish & Chips with my daughter and her hubby had a wedge salad. For the table we decided to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese which from the description sounded great. Once delivered we could clearly see that we had built this up in our minds to something it failed short to deliver on. Once we started to dig into it we were reminded of Kraft Mac & Cheese with a few bits of lobster. The cheese was runny and very Kraft like so there was no hot bubbly and crusty goodness to this dish...not even, \"please be careful not to touch the dish it's really hot\" coming from the server....Anyway, we ate it and commented amongst ourselves about how this dish falls short and is not worthy of Gordon Ramsey's name. I even commented that, \"If he was here I'd ask him to try it and would rail him if he thinks this is acceptable of his name and the $26.00 price tag attached to it. I decided to let the server know that it fell short of expectations even though we consumed it entirely. She was very gracious and even sent the manager our way. I repeated the way it fell short of expectations based on the word smithing in the menu...to which he apologized profusely and offered to take it off the bill...I rebuked his offer bu he insisted and won out. The fish and chips were ok as was the salad. I'll give it another try for sure but do not expect miracles. I don't envy Gordon Ramsay putting his name on lots of different venues and trusting that they all would meet his expectations when they can't meet even mine.",

The fries were a bit of a disappointment. I'm adding a half point on how well they did the peas. First you have to like peas and then again you need to like mint as it's seems to me a combo dish. Personally loved it. Wife had the butternut squash soup and practically licked the bowl. Bartender service outstanding. Will be back next visit.",

Add to that the fact it's a Gordon Ramsey establishment and the cost ticks up.  But what did you expect?  Vegas, The Strip, Gordon Ramsey, and a $6 burger? Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion based on their experience.  We had a great time and everything we ate was excellent.  Could there be a little Ramsey bashing going on?  Why, you ask, if it was so good did I only give it 4 stars?  Well our server was excellent but that was the last staff member that was.  The hostesses are in need of training.  We were promptly seated only to be told several minutes later that there was no server on duty of that table (despite tables all around us being handled).  So we were moved and damn if it didn't happen again!  The third seating was a charm, however.  Unfortunately, it wasn't handled well.  Their staffing issues should not be experienced by the customer especially when they had what appeared to be plenty of staff on hand.  And yes, for the amount of money we spent you expect better service.  However, the problem wasn't the food!  I've lived in Vegas for many years and watch restaurants come and go.  All experience some growing pains.  I sincerely hope that this one grows out of theirs.  We'll go back expecting the same great food, higher than average prices, but much better service.",

I'm usually not a bread pudding dessert fan but it was one of the best things I've ever had. I've had the push pop version at burgr that is equally delicious. If it weren't for the price, I'd give this place 4 stars!",

Every waiter however wears the same weird outfit, which in my opinion should be rethought, but I don't like men in skinny jeans. Being seated took some time because the place was busy but I could see many unoccupied tables. Not enough help? Once seated the waitress was friendly and answered any questions we had. My husband ordered fish and chips. He wasn't impressed. He said the batter was bland. I had the sliders and although greasy they were very tasty. The absolute highlight of the meal was the truffle mac and cheese served family style! That was amazing! I would go back just to eat that! I would eat here again.",

We had two appetizers, fish & chips, a chicken pot pie, a pot pie sampler, a Caesar salad, one alcohol drink, three sodas and two desserts. Does that sound like a $225 meal to you?  $29 for two pieces of fish and shoe string fries? Really?  There was a side order of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes listed on the menu for $12 or $13. Those potatoes would have to perform a dance or stand up routine to be worth that kind of money. This is pub food not fine dining.  The only reason we went was we had $125 worth of gift certificates we had to burn and this place had space available on a Saturday evening. We never expected to have to add $100 to cover the bill.",

Baby beet salad, $16, very good 2. Ale onion soup, $12.  OK, wouldn't order again. 3. London Calling (cocktail), $15, very good 4. Cornish Chicken, $26.  Hubby liked this dish, I didn't try it. 5 Fish & Chips  - large pieces of fishy-tasting cod, fried the way I remembered it in London. Tastes better if you pour malt vinegar on it, but the bottle had one of those spouts that will pour large amts if you're not careful.  The fries were wedge-type, meh. $26. I really wanted to try the sticky toffee, but we were too full.  If you want dessert, would recommend you skip any appetizer, salad or soup. The portions are very large in LV.",

Of the 4 dishes, the food was bland, dried, cold (when it should have been hot) and beyond disappointing. The wait staff must have been trained by the Renaissance Festival circa 1980. Since when does a person go out to spend $30 a plate and be treated like they're wasting a servers time and beneath them? Here's a bit of advice, you can talk to me like Gordon Ramsay when you're writing my paycheck. But if I'm the one potentially giving you yours, don't give me any lip and don't act like an ass.

Phenomenal food and great service...everyone was happy. Came back today with just myself, my Husband and Son. We sat at a high top in the bar area. Worst service ever. One girl came and asked if we wanted anything other than water. I said as soon as my husband gets here yes, he was parking the car. She never came back. Husband came, we waited. And waited. Finally a guy came and asked if he could take out food order. We ordered. And waited. And waited. Husbands salad came out and it was supposed to be blue cheese. We said so and got a blank stare with a \"well this is balsamic vinaigrette.\" Uh, we'd like what we ordered please.\" And got attitude. Food came out two minutes later. Then the salad five after that. Still good food but by this time no one came to get our drink order or bring water. Ever again. We tried several times to get ANYONES attention and were ignored. My son jumped in front of the guy who took our order to get the check. I get that it was busy but I couldn't even tell you if we had a server let alone which one it was. First time I have ever not left a tip. Please get it together because we really like the food.",

I passed my credit card as we only had 45 min and knew we'd need to drink, eat and run...RayRay passed the card back but not before he slyly recognized my company name listed below mine.  He called me by name but also just before we left, had his manager come over and introduce himself.  They both said \"Thank you for the business, not only today, but for all the business we bring to Las Vegas!\" It took me a minute to realize that he had coyly notice I work for the Las Vegas Convention Authority.  This experience with that kind of attention to detail and personal service, is what makes every visitor return home with a great story and attributes to making Las Vegas the number one tourist destination that it is!  Thank you RayRay and team for making me and our city look fantastic.    P.S. The customer brought a 20,000 person convention to town one month later. They told me they brought 6 groups of people to Gordon Ramsey Pub because of this interaction with RayRay!  Great job sir!",

To top it off we also met 2 over the top people, Randy G.  Bar manager, what a class act. He made sure our experience was unforgettable and took a genuine interest in us, he went as far as introducing us to season 10 winning chef ... She was very welcoming and even though she was extremely busy, she took the time to get to know us and let us know how thankful she was that we choose Chef Ramsey's pub and grill to dine  She even took pictures with us.... This restaurant is the Bomb, great food, atmosphere and fun people, who's service levels were over the top. We returned Sunday and the experience was consistent. We were waited on by Scott who was entertaining, service driven and truly interested in creating another unforgettable experience. RANDY was working the evening shift and when he seen us, he immediately came to welcome us and to insure our dining experience was top notch. Even though we just met these fine people, they made us feel like family and they there actions reflected a perception of passion for the service industry and that they loved what they do. I would highly recommend you make Chef Ramsey pub and grill inside of Ceases Palace a must experience, when in Vegas this restaurant was Amazing!! Thank you Randy, Carri, Scott and the season 10 winning chef for making my Birthday and visit to Vegas an experience I my wife and friends will not forget.",

Our party of seven had reservations for over two moths prior to arrival, unfortunately we still waited twenty five minutes to be seated. Our server who was friendly and enthusiastic was also inattentive and unprofessional. We waited for over 15 min. every time we ordered drinks, and even though our entrees took 67 mins from the moment we sat down, he only served one serving of bread sticks (5). We are frequent travelers to Las Vegas and clearly understand that everything is over priced, However we were extremely disappointed in the service and the quality of the food.",

Located inside Caesars Palace where Bradley Ogden used to be. As expected for such a spot, prices are a bit on the higher side, and like all other Caesar properties, slightly discounted(read as $1-2) prices for their Total Rewards cardholders. Had the shepherds pie. Very good. Our server seemed a bit slow. Took him awhile to greet us, refill waters etc. He brought out the complementary bread when we were in the middle of the meal. He did apologize about that. I heard good things about their desserts but didn't try any this visit, maybe next time. Woulda gave it 4 stars but the service wasn't grade A. If the prices don't give you sticker shock and youre in Caesars Palace, it wouldnt be a bad place to try.",

    "text": "Had a dinner date here & it was one of the highlights of our trip to Vegas last week--it helps that we already love both pub food and British fare in general.  Briefly: The shepherd's pie was excellent, and my wife devoured her lamb burger with much love. We think the real highlights were the starters and desserts, though; the \"Pub Spots\" (sliders) were phenomenal, and we think well worth the price. We ordered 3 desserts to share (though it turned out to be too much by that point in the meal, and we left a little at the table) and while all were bliss-worthy treats, the sticky toffee pudding was the standout favorite (and the only one entirely finished).  A bit pricey, but more affordable for us than, say, Gordon Ramsay Steak and (we think) worth it. The service we received (it was relatively early; we arrived around 5:30PM for dinner) was excellent, and we never felt we were waiting long for anything--and there was always someone to hand to take a plate or refill a drink or whatever was needed.   After watching Ramsay on TV for a few years, it was nice to be able to see that he really does run (or at least put his name on) well-run restaurants with great food and service. We probably won't return, but it'll be because we've saved up for Steak, next time we want to do Ramsay in Vegas!",

    "text": "Let me first say, I love Gordon Ramsay. I think he is a fantastic chef and watch him all the time. So when I was planning my anniversary trip it was a must that we eat in at least one of Gordon's restaurants. So we decided on the Pub & Grill because my girlfriend really wanted the fish and chips after seeing him make his recipe on one of his shows. I ordered the Shepard's Pie with cheddar mashed potatoes. Then we ended the meal with the lemon raspberry tart.   The negatives: we made a reservation weeks in advance and were placed directly next to kitchen. There was also a store room where chairs were paraded in and out throughout our hour there. I don't know if they get a lot of walk ins or if they are primarily reservations, but making a reservation should ensure you don't get placed in the worst seat in the house. Maybe that's an unspoken rule that this restaurant doesn't acknowledge. The fish and chips were ridiculously greasy. I understand fried food is greasy but I pinched off a small bit and had grease running down my arm. Parts of the batter were raw which is never pleasant to bite into. The Lemon Raspberry tart did not arrive per the menu description and the staff did not mention any changes to the menu. I get that ingredients sometimes run out but there wasn't even any raspberry on the tart. It was supposed to have a jam and compote, but instead it  came with some fresh strawberry and blueberries with a dollop of whip. Not bad just not as expected.  On the plus side: The wait staff was amazing. The food came out hot and delicious in a matter of minutes. The shepard's pie was perfect in every delightful morsel of a way. The atmosphere at the restaurant was great and cool for a pub. The cod was cooked perfectly  and the fries were great. I had never had smashed peas and they are a new fav.",

We have a table for six and it has been 40 mins since we ordered and still nothing on the table yet. Our water needs refilling at this point in time but she just looks at us and keeps moving. I'm so thirsty right now i feel like im about to go drink from the water fountain at the bellagio The chair is unusually high with no backrest in this joint. Better be carefully or u Crack your head when u slip.   I'll edit this review once the food comes out...   The food is OK. Not great, not good, but ok. I expected more from a Gordon ramsay restaurant seeing how they put him on TV and shit. Now i know why he's pissed all the time, it's all shitty. How do you not provide spoons when customers order soup? The rice was stale. The steak was very bitter. The clam chowder is good, but i think i like progresso better. I'll stick with yelps reviews next time.   Btw, did I mentioned that their chairs are super uncomfortable??",

    "text": "Let's start off that in Caesar's Palace, there is no shortage of food options. Fine dining is as commonplace as a tourist with a spiked neon slushie in a foot-long container. That said... When we chose to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, it was calculated. We were all enthusiastic to eat at this scary, yet reputable chef's restaurant.  But all went awry when 45 minutes after placing our order, our party was awaiting the APPETIZER.  And the most puzzling part was that the restaurant was damn near EMPTY at the time we ate. Where the dag nabbit was Ramsay with his inappropriate and oft mal-placed British curses and wrinkled forehead to scare the bejesus out of these chefs for a hustle on our order? 45 minutes on a meal in Vegas? You know what I missed? I missed the taxi cab that was going to take me to MGM to see Calvin Harris. Or... I might have missed the end results of the poker tournament at Rio. Or... At least 2 drinks with my cousins from out of  town.  In other words, time is money and in Vegas, time and money is currency.   Ramsay, you have a 3-star pub and grill. And your name brought us despite the mediocre reviews. I still have a homoerotic man-crush on you, but the service  needs a firm kick in the pants.",

Both were medium quality to be equated to any \"English Pub\" that reuses their oil for frying.  After dinner we ordered coffee (to which no menu was offered) and dessert. The coffee came out 7min before the dessert and was luke warm at best. We had to cancel the dessert due to the bitter taste the coffee left on our pallets.  Again, I expected much more from GR's establishment.",

Also, the busser dumped a drink all over us right as we were getting ready to leave.   Giving 2 stars because our server was solid and the craft cocktails were pretty good.

It is a step (or two) up in the quality and inventiveness of the food of Chili's or BJ's, with a more \"sophisticated\" beer and wine list. They handled our group of 14 even better than expected. It was impressive; Ramsey really does know how to run a restaurant. They messed up some items on our order, and more than made up for it by comping those items and apologizing. Our total bill was around $860, including tip. (~$61/each). If you expect haute cuisine, try one of Ramsey's other places. For well-prepared pub food, the Pub & Grill is a good, but pricy spot.",

While we were on the waiting list we went and got a beverage from the bar across the way we got called to our table the host rudely told us it was not okay and to finish our FULL drinks which was totally reasonable. Not even 3 minutes later she came up to us and asked if we were finished (which we were clearly not) so we politely said yes and threw away all of them. Secondly, we let the server know it was our friends birthday which he could care less. It was awful service with subpar food. My girlfriends and I will never be coming back or giving a good recommendation. I don't think I saw a smile from anyone working or a costumer.",

The one they replaced it with was indeed a filet and cooked properly.  The sides were terrible.

    "text": "Being a longtime fan of Gordon Ramsey, I must admit that my expectations for this Pub were pretty high.  Our server was very friendly and pretty good. We started off with the Pretzel Appetizer - not any better than any other pretzel appetizer you could get at any sit-down restaurant. We then ordered the scallops, mashed potatoes and lobster mac & cheese.  Scallops - they were cooked decently, but surprised by how tasteless and bland they were Mashed Potatoes - Very tasty and very lumpy, but in a charming way Lobster Mac & Cheese - Not as tasty as I was hoping. Was even more disappointed when I CHOKED ON PIECES OF LOBSTER SHELL in my food.  I did notify the server about the shells who then spoke with one of her bosses not more than 5 feet from me who said they didn't shuck the lobster from the shell, but that it comes pre-done. Now there are 2 things that really bother me about this situation: 1) I paid $27 for Lobster Mac & Cheese and it appears that quality is not a priority for this restaurant. 2) The manager didn't even take the time to come and apologize to me. I wasn't expecting this to be comp'd, but an apology for serving me lobster shells in a dish that is supposed to be void of it I think merits at least an apology.",

    "text": "Having been a patron to Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, I figured his pub and grille could be a good choice since I absolutely loved my food at Burgr.   I was so wrong.   I wasn't terribly hungry so hubby and I decided to do appetizers only. We were staying at the hotel so we reviewed the menu in the room (note: the listing says casual dining but the prices are equivalent to or more than the upscale restaurants) and headed down.   The hostess told us it was a 15 minute wait so we added our name and stood around. After half an hour, I realized the hostess forgot us as she kept seating other 2 top parties right away. I told her the dilemma and she insisted she didn't forget us and that we were next. Sooo we finally got seated after 30 minutes of wasted time. Not too good of a start for dinner.   Our waitress took our drink order of a soda each ($5 sodas. Yeah. That's not casual dining prices) and didn't return with our drinks for 20+minutes. So here we are thinking we were forgotten by the hostess and now by our server.   We ordered the lobster mini rolls (it comes with only 2.....not really an appetizer and more of a small bite) and the jumbo shrimp cocktail (7 shrimp if even...with large croutons stuffed between them.)  The food was actually delicious but was overshadowed by the ridiculous expense of it all. We spent equivalent to a full fledged meal for two on two drinks and two appetizers. The service was abhorrent and absolutely TERRIBLE for a high end establishment.   Save yourself the time and money by not eating here. This restaurant is a flop.",

    "text": "Went to Gordon Ramsay Pub for lunch on a Saturday when I had a bunch of buddies in town.  Service was fantastic.  To start, we had the deviled eggs and sliders.  I had both dishes before, and they didn't disappoint.  One guy proclaimed the sliders the best burger he had eaten.  They are perfect in composition and execution, you get every ingredient in every bite.  They are consistent as well.  Our table ordered a second helping....  To eat, I had fish and chips and part of the short rib/beef cheek sandwich.  The sandwich was legit, had a little spice to it, and the meats were very tender.  Likewise, the fish and chips were fantastic, although the fries are a little thick for my taste.  I realize this is classic for this dish, I just prefer skinnier fries.  The fish and chips may seem expensive at around $26, but you get a LOT of food.  Very large pieces of fish, and the breading can stand up to vinegar or the homemade tartar sauce.  Both entrees are definite repeats.  For dessert, I recommended the sticky toffee pudding.  This is the 2nd time I've had it (we ordered 2 servings, like with the sliders), and I still say it may be the best dessert I've eaten.  We had people eating the caramel sauce out of the small pitcher it comes in.  This dessert is moist, yet a little crunchy.  The ice cream and sauce complement it very well.  A must order.  Good beer selection, and knowledgeable servers.  This is an excellent place to get a casual bite while at Caesars.",

    "text": "In a nutshell, disappointed. I really hate to say it, but I am. I'll never come back, and here's why:  $30 for fish & chips!!!!  (Was it you or Caesers that set the prices?)  Best I've had in Vegas, definitely outside of England, but are you freaking kidding me??  $30!! For a spoonful of mushy peas, a few steak cut fries, and (2) 2x2 inch fish fillets??  Yard House fish & chips are almost half the price, same portion size & just as good.   Lightly battered. Crunchy on both sides. Fish flakey & cooked through. Fries were great. Mushy peas...I prefer them without the mint. Fantastic!!  Definitely not worth $30!!  Lobster mac? Just good. Cheesy. Not great. Not fab. Not worth $25, even if you split it with a friend.  It's a side item, not an entree. No chunks of lobster in this, but its there. Just not easily noticeable.   $5 for ice tea. And we had to beg for a refill.   As for our server: don't know her name. My receipt says Lisa W. Wanted to take our drink order before the hostess walked away from seating us. She was nice when she was at our table. Lots of attention prior to ordering, none after. She was kinda a know it all about English food, trying to one-up us when we asked a question about the food in comparison to what we've eaten in England.  Refilled our tea WITHOUT ice. So much for ice tea.   Our bill was $90 for 2 people: 2 ice teas, mac & cheese, fish & chips, & some corned beef sandwich. We left with NO desire to come back. NO longing to come back to try something else. Chef, your prices suck!!  Your own burger here is TWICE that of what you serve at BurGR and truffle chips are better & $3 less at BurGR too! And you get more!!  I expect to pay these prices at an upscale restaurant, like Steak, but NOT a pub. Not even in the UK!!  Come during happy hour. Sadly I will never be able to. I work full-time!!  This place DEFINITELY caters to tourists & not the locals.",

We shared the 'Pigs in a Blanket' for an appetizer, served with HP sauce and spicy mustard, very tasty. For our mains my husband had the 'Beef Wellington' which he thoroughly enjoyed, cooked perfectly. I had the 'Fish & Chips'. I personally prefer a firmer fish like haddock or halibut, but the cod was good. The batter was light and not greasy. I enjoyed the steak cut chips and the mint mushy peas were nice; served with ketchup, tartar sauce, lemon slice and malt vinegar. We were stuffed but shared the free 'Sticky Toffee Pudding' for dessert, it was delicious! Our server was Chris and he was attentive and helpful.

    "text": "Whenever were in town Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill  is a must stop for us and we always bring friends to try the amazing food. I'm a huge fan of Gordon and I've followed his passion before he was famous in the states. So the chance of anyone in my circle stating something negative about him is not going to happen! So with that said, it brings me great disappointment to write this review. Brought friends to the Pub & Grill Saturday, and it was the worst experience with the exception of our waiter. Our starters: crispy pork belly with a mustard cream sauce. This was simply delicious. Perfect layers of crisp, juiciness and tender melt in your mouth belly paired with the full flavored course mustard. Second starter was Maine Lobster and Shrimp roll. This was ok not what I would've expected from Ramsay at all, (the Lobster Truck in town is a better choice) My main dish was an English cheddar burger with fries. My dish was plated wrong they gave me a salad forgot the fries. Our waiter was getting frustrated because the chef/s couldn't get his orders right and he was trying to rectify their mistakes. I took one bite of my burger and it was full of salt. The burger was so salty it had a crispy layer of salt around the patty that felt like it burnt my taste buds. This completely ruined my entire meal. Our waiter noticed that something was wrong and came to my rescue trying to help by offering something new on the menu. I kindly refused and he said the manager would be right over to talk to us. Well you know what they say in \"Business\" your staff is only as good as the manager!!! It took a very long time to get water, to get serviced, to get refills on water, to get our food and shocking the manager never came to our table!!! It must be difficult to be a waiter with a restaurant full of staff and managers!!!but your really on your own trying to keep up the good name of Gordon Ramsay !!! he apologized once again for everything and one last try to make things right,  he was told my favorite dessert is cream Brule and insisted that I try it! it was delicious and his eagerness to make sure we were happy and left full was very much appreciated.  However, I can't say that we'll be referring friends here anymore. Extremely saddened and disappointed that Gordon Ramsay's  name is on this Pub!",

First - our server Rodney made it a great experience and the reason for the 5 star review!  He was good sport when I misheard his name, fixed our table when it wobbled, and provided personal recommendations.  He also shared some fun stories with us and talked about his background a bit.  What a great experience, he's definitely among the top servers I've experienced around the world!  Second - the food was tasty and well portioned.  We really enjoyed the side order of fingerling potatoes, VERY well seasoned and pancetta, yum!  My chopped salad was good and my colleague's fish & chips was described as \"very good!\"  Overall - highly recommend, was fun to people watch in Caesar's Palace and the staff was all very friendly.  Thanks for making it a great experience!",

It wasn't anything special,  could have got the same fish and taste at a cheaper restaurant and it would have been the same.

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of Gordon's for years and watched almost all of his shows. Hells Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, and the like but by far my favorite has always been 'the F word'. Now maybe it's because he has all those shows and how critical he is that we are eager to experience a GR restaurant! And of course he did not make my meal today and anytime you build large restaurants (franchises) then there will always be some loss of fidelity. Having said that - I was excited to try the pub here. First of all if you're gonna name it a Pub your prices shouldn't reflect that of 5 star steak house. That aside (it's Vegas - inside Caesars after all). I ordered a beer and an app at the bar oh and a water. The calamari I ordered was dreadful - it tasted more like deep fried salt pellets, which is to say that someone dumped so much salt on this dish that I'll not be tasting anything for the next 3 days. The only saving grace was the awesome water that came in a clean as opposed to my $11 pint of peroni which didn't. See picture of water below.   Dare I say that Gordon or his staff failed in the hiring of the staff for this place - and perhaps has gotten a little smitten with himself and lost touch a little because the decor and staff uniforms are just pretentious wank! Maybe he should put this place on restaurant nightmares or get kitchen crashed or something. Sorry but being spread as thin as he is is no excuse it still falls on his rep - this place....FAIL! I would give a half more star if I could for the staff courtesy in dealing with my shocking food and delivering great H2o.",

We ordered buffalo chicken wings which tasted great, the sauce they used offered just the right amount of heat w/o taking away from the taste of the chicken.  I ordered the fish and chips as my meal and my gf ordered the lamb burger.  Overall I'd say the entrees were pretty good.  I ordered a beer called Innis & Gunn Original to compliment my meal, I can't say enough about the beer, it was full of flavor.  I ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  This hands down has to me one of the best sweets I've ever eaten.  I don't have much of  a sweet tooth but this dessert was delicious.    The meal itself was a little on the pricy side for being lunch but it's Vegas, so it comes with the territory.  The waitress was both so nice, knowledgable, and made great recommendations.",

    "text": "I was real excited to try Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill. Service was slow at first but I think that was because the dinner menu was just starting.  When we ordered our food the Brussels sprouts were great. I ordered a half lobster and when I turned it over there was no meat in the shell!  We let our waitress know but the cook didn't believe it was served that way. This made my dining experience very poor thinking I had someone else's leftovers. They thought I ate the lobster meat and was trying to get more.  I did get another half lobster with meat after my family finished their food.  There was no compensation for the situation. We left feeling we just spent a large amount of money on a poor dining experience and were rushed to get out for the next set of people.  I will definitely not go back and my view of Gordon Ramsey restaurants is definitely a one. The experience made me feel like they just wanted my money. I would be embarrassed if I were Gordon Ramsey and saw what happened.",

The fish was light and a very nice batter but Chilis, or any good local brew pub's were just as good and 1/3 to 1/2 the price.   I had Cesar salad with chicken.  I get it that this is not a signature dish, but it was really uninspired.  The chicken was a rather dry breast that was just dropped on the side of the salad.  Not cut into bite size pieces. Again any local microbrewery or local would have been just as good for 1/2 the price.",

You pay $15 for a small 8oz glass of their house drinks, when in other places you would get 12oz or bigger. To top off our experience, our server Christopher Lee was fabulous!!! Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to everyone and ask for Chris!",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay is a name that has branded itself as funky, unique and a good quality dining experience, and that is exactly what you will get at the Pub & Grill! Located conveniently at Caesars Palace, it opened about three years ago with now head chef Scott Commings from Hell's Kitchen!  When I first walked in, I was greeted by a friendly hostess and noticed the unique uniform that the staff wears. I love how they dress the part and really makes the dining experience even more unique. I came here on a Saturday for lunch where there was futbol (soccer) game showing so the restaurant was live and packed! The ambiance felt so warm and welcoming and the decor inside the restaurant was modern and very classy. Of course, I didn't except anything less for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant inside Caesars Palace!  I ate here for lunch and picking my meal was hard when I wanted to try everything! Carrie and Sara were our waitress and they were so friendly and accommodating to me and my friend. They told us about the restaurant, a little bit of the background and many things about the menu. Just talking to them for the first few minutes, I knew they were knowledgeable and trustworthy of their suggestions.  First, the drinks! They have an array of beers, wines, and cocktails! They have a full bar and use fresh ingredients to make your drinks. I tried the very popular cocktail suggested by Carrie called \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" and I must say... best drink ever! It is so refreshing for a hot summer day. I believe it is a blueberry vodka drink with muddled fresh berries and a splash of sparkling wine! For an appetizer, I tried the calamari with bacon bits. Wow! It is out of the ordinary. The calamari was crunchy and packed with flavor, especially with the bacon added to it and they make their own tartar sauce! For my main course, I tried the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. The portions are huge! My sandwich came with a very thick and toasted sandwich packed with chicken and mouth-watering pesto! The fries were crunchy and simple to compliment all the flavors inside the sandwich! Lunch was delicious and I wish I had enough room for dessert. I have been hearing from word of mouth, yelp and the staff that the sticky toffee pudding is a must-try! I will definitely try it next time I dine!  Overall, the experience was amazing. Everything from food to service was impeccable. Carrie and Sara were amazing! I had mentioned that my friend and I were fans of Hell's Kitchen so Chef Scott came out and introduced himself! It was a very friendly and unexpected gesture that made my dining experience even better! I will definitely be back again!",

I was thinking oh these will be regular bar pretzels. Oh Gordon Ramsey, the things you do! First, it comes with three different pretzels. The bacon pretzel is by far my favorite! The two sauces were also quite amazing! The mustard gave it a kick while the cheese was a nice finishing touch.   For our main meal, I ordered the Pub BLT (blt is my favorite meal at home) and my partner ordered the bangers and mash. After eating the Pub BLT, my homemade BLT will never be the same! The cheese bread was so light. The flavors and fillings of he sandwich were so perfect. I ate slow to savor every bite. The perfectly crisp chips that came with BLT were an amazing compliment for my dinner.  The bangers and mash was also amazing. It comes with three different sausages and the most amazing mash.   The only down side to our visit was our server, Scott. He seemed very disinterested in assisting us at all. Thankfully there was another server who came by a few times to make sure we were ok.",

After eating here, this eatery met my expectations. Since this is an English pub it made sense to order the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not a big fan of meat pies as they tend to be heavy. This meat pie was hearty. I love the mashed potato covering on the pie as it had that outer crust. In addition the mashed potato was creamy and not heavy. Regarding the meat there is a contrasting texture with the minced beef and lamb that makes the dish very appetizing. Everyone mentions about the Sticky Toffee Dessert but for dessert I ordered the Spotted \"Dic\". I liked how the warm bread pudding meshed with the cold ice cream. I would have given a higher rating had it not been for the Truffle Chips. I expected the chips to be a thick cut chip. Instead the chips were the typical skinny cut. Overall I had a good dinner Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.",

Not much to brag about, tasty but I've had better.   Wife ordered the chicken plate and she couldn't stop raving about it. Paired nicely with some pesto and gnocchi (I totally stole her gnocchi) and that was pretty good. Pesto was super rich and creamy, loved the flavor and the smoothness of it.   I order the chop salad but those are boring to review. Kinda disappointed with the flavor. Felt pretty bland to me but again, who the hell cares about a review of a salad.

I let her know we had a reservation and we were immediately seated, table waiting and ready for us.  This was absolutely amazing, especially when everything in Vegas is usually a wait for a table.  Definitely worth booking a reservation ahead of time.  After being seated, we were waited on by Tayler, who was absolutely the best server we had this entire trip.  His attention to detail was much appreciated.  His recommendations were on point.  I went for a filet steak, but once I saw the prime rib special, I was sold.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection at a medium rare temp.  It was delicious.  The MacNCheese trio on the starter menu is a must have.  The Pesto MacNCheese is so tasty and well worth it!  We researched the menu before we arrived in Vegas so we were prepared on the price range for dinner, it was right on point, we budgeted just enough for this amazing dinner.  Big Thanks to Tayler for making this dinner a great one!",

As a server when you bring fries and burger better to know how much ketchup to serve with the food.  I wouldn't try this place again.",

My party of three ate an appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 beverages and dessert for 120 bucks.  Great deal. Thanks again.",

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the pesto chicken. Both were fine but fine is not how we expected to think about our meal. It took 40 minutes to sit, get a drink, eat an appetizer, order dinner and eat dinner. But it took 30 minutes from the time we finished to have our plates cleared and bill delivered. Would not recommend for anyone who is looking to have a Gordon Ramsey quality meal. Would not go back.",

But... considering this particular restaurant was just standard pub fare it just wasn't worth the prices. If you're going to pay this much for the Gordon Ramsey experience you're better off going to one of his nicer steak houses.  That being said..  The food was really good!  We got the deviled eggs and the warm pretzel snacks. Then the mini pie starter. I had the fish and chips. And our table shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  Everything we tried was delicious just expensive.  For a table of 3... With 3 beers, 2 snacks,  1 appetizer,  3 entrees and one dessert. .. total bill was $178. Could have been worse I guess",

He (Travis) had a attitude and totally ignored is from the moment we sat down till we paid the bill.  Travis didn't ask us if we wanted drinks, I had to order a drink for my gf from the bar. After our food arrived we were not asked if everything was ok. The guests next to us were asked if they're food was ok immediately a after their food arrived. We needed salt and pepper as well as more catchup. We were asked about our food when we were practically done with our entries, too late.  Not a pleasant experience. Travis treated us like crap as he hovered over s group of girls dining next to us.  I loved the food, bad service though.",

The kettle chips, the meat and the sharpness of the cheese was perfect. I also had the pastrami sandwich. The bread on the sandwich was sort sort of zucchini that takes a whole day to make and to me tasted like pumpernickel, which was the PERFECT combo, and it was worth the wait. Derek had me try three beers and they were all different than I am used to and tasty. I can't wait to go back and try some desserts.",

I can't say the food here is stellar, especially since I don't eat fish.  What we had wasn't too bad, the pretzels were the best, and my kids loved the mini burgers.  It would be nice for them to have more items that are kid friendly, maybe some chicken fingers..    Scott was our server and he was very, very knowledgeable about the menu as well as his customer service was top notch.  I'm pretty sure he was on point with ordering our meal, but I guess there was a bit of a disconnect with the computer and the kitchen.  I've worked in the service industry and I can say that Scott was a great waiter.  I forgot to post about Scott's excellent service, I had to find the receipt so I could post his name and make sure everyone knew it wasn't his error on the food but the kitchens...  What really won me over was the manager Michelle.  She was awesome!  My meal came out all wrong, twice, and she went above and beyond to make things right.  One of the things that I thought was awesome was that she never threw anyone under the bus.  She just made it right, and even got some cherries from the bar for my daughter to make sure she was smiling.  I'm huge on customer service and she made our experience well worth it.  I'm not sure if I'll be back for the food, but Michelle is for sure a keeper in the restaurant management game...",

I had a beer that cost $9.00 which was a bit much, but the food prices are what you should expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  Tip: make sure to make reservations & if you have a rewards card you can get a discount.  Menu tip: they have a bar menu & a dinner menu. So make sure to ask for both. If you sit at the bar you can only order from the bar menu.  Food recommendation: I highly recommend the Mac & cheese. It's like no other you have ever had. It is topped with truffles. It is a good portion so you can share with another person or take the other half home.  If your not a fan of steak fries then I don't recommend the pub chips since they are twice the thickness of steak fries, my husband is very picky and did not like them, but I thought they were yummy.",

    "text": "Got a horrible table here on Memorial Day weekend (with a reservation) on a busy racetrack area near the kitchen, where waiters were whizzing by all night, creating distractions and lots of shouting over the meal - never a good start.  Our waiter also was interrupted three times while trying to go over our questions on the menu by other patrons as if we weren't even there, which is also another star off.  I could go down to two stars, but it wasn't awful food, but it wasn't spectacular either.   It's a high priced Pub, and with a star chef's name attached, I expected better.  I have been to Ramsay's Burgr place and that's a four star burger, but this was just meh.  Soups and salads all serviceable.  If you are in an English Pub, have to try one of the mainstays, so I went with the Fish and Chips.  You get two very large pieces of fish and plenty of chips, but a tiny little tin of tartar sauce (had to ask for more and that seemed to be a chore for the waiter).  Decor is fun and a lot to look at, but highly bothered by the service and location we got.  Not likely going back to this place.",

They were very dry and salty. The fish and chips were just as bad, three thick strips of fried fish with not much taste to it.  The waiter asked how'd we like our food and we told him the condition. He offered to give us another order of steak and pork chop but we turned it down. Who has room for another piece of bad steak?  The manager came to apologize. I thought that gesture was very nice. In conclusion, we came for the big name and realized the food was just mediocre.",

    "text": "My wife and I recently visited Las Vegas for our anniversary. As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Friday afternoon we chose to start our GR Tour of Vegas at the Pub and Grill. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and seated. Within a few min we were introduced to our server Joe. For anyone reading this, please ask to sit in Joe's section. His friendliness, and knowledge of the menu was refreshing. He was able to make some suggestions that sounded amazing, however after seeing the nachos Gordon Ramsay posted on his Instagram we couldn't help but give them a try, and boy are we glad we did! They are out of this world! In addition to the nachos we enjoyed a chicken pesto sandwich. While the flavor was amazing I almost cracked a tooth about half way through on a chicken bone. I discreetly brought this to Joe's attention so he could give the chef a heads up for future sandwiches. What was impressive, is where most servers acknowledge and nothing ever comes of it, he immediately spoke to his manager Derek who came over to apologize and even went as far as offering us a dessert. To think I almost left needing dental work, but still feel compelled to give a 5 star rating should tell you how great Joe and Derek were! They both truly understand the meaning of customer service and I hope someone at the Gordon Ramsay Group reads this to provide them with the recognition they deserve!   PS - The sticky toffee is to die for and personally I think it has Steak beat!",

The place is like being in an English pub without the plane ride. Did have a few items of note featuring scotch eggs, bangers and mash, and a few types of meat pies i.e. Shepherds etc. The prices are quite high, but less than Gordon Ramsey steak. If you are a fan of Gordon's and are by Cesar's Palace I would definitely recommend it.",

The waiter we had was so polite and so nice. I adored him!!!   For my meal, I got the fish and chips. It was alright. I'm also not a huge fan of the fries (they were soaked in the oil from the fried fish). The fish kept coming out of the fried bater.   My parents each had a beef burger and lamb burger. They were really good.   My date had the vegetable salad, which was refreshing, amazing, and light. I would so go back just for that! The vinaigrette on it was so delectable.   He had the scallops for his entree, which was covered in the best white sauce. It was so good that I kept dipping my fish in it or my fries. Definitely the best out of the ones we ordered.   As a side, we all had the lobster mac and cheese to share for the table. Um ... yes. This was actually better than the mac & cheese at GR's Steak. There were HUGE chunks of lobster in it.   By the end, I was licking the bowl - we sadly have photographic proof of this that I must now go destroy.   Also, GR's Pub & Grill have two of the dishes that are exclusives to his Hell's Kitchen menu at Steak: Scottish Egg and the toffee dessert!!!!  Check it out if you're a fan!",

It wasn't upscale, it was an English pub just like ones in London except without the history.   The menu did a great job at reflecting British fare. Shepard's pie, steak and chips, fish and chips, and mashed peas were all present.  What we ordered: Crispy white bait a traditional pub dish. Fried light and crispy with a creamy aioli.  Duo rillette of pork and duck with brown mustard and pickled radishes and grilled thick toast. Lamb shank with chickpea stew. Lamb had a tender \"fall off the bone\" meatiness and a hint of that masala in a tomato stew.  Steak and fries were standard, True to form pub style. All washed down with a bottle of Beaujolais.   Solid and hearty food; more like 3.5 stars. We ordered way more than needed. Didn't get a chance to try the sticky toffee, but there is always next time.",

My cousin also ordered the fish and chips and hers was covered in too much oil. My dad had the braised beef which was good but that one good didn't make up for all the other bad dishes. My drink and my Aunts drink were too sour and full of sugar. Our apps were just average. We had the nachos and calamari. Overall the food was not great and super over priced.

    "text": "This was the most disappointing meal of our vacation. I have long been a fan of Gordon Ramsay not just through his American shows which are fairly insufferable, but his British ones in which you see that he is a person who practices what he preaches. Sadly, this Pub & Grill is the embodiment of the American cartoon version of Ramsay that so many people have embraced. The pretentious decor is overly busy and fatiguing from the design of the fake wall outside made from kegs to the ridiculous studded belts and Hot Topic shorts the waitstaff wear. Even if one were to enjoy the aesthetic, there are still several details that I doubt GR would approve of if he were actually on site. These include things like water being served from swing top bottles that still have sticker residue on them and wall paper that was peeling in the bathrooms.   All of this would be forgivable if the food was stellar, but sadly it doesn't live up to he name here either. My steak and ale pie was served piping hot while my wife's bangers and mash were lukewarm. Additionally, while the sauce and crust of the pie were delicious, most of the steak was very tough and chewy. While there were two or three pieces of melt-in-your-mouth steak in there, they just made me more angry that they were the exception to the rule.   So after $60 for two tiny entrees and water that were worse than the offerings from my local Irish pub, I couldn't help but wonder who this restaurant was for. It's too spendy for the regular pub crowd, but the food doesn't live up to the GR name. That leaves only diehard Hell's Kitchen fans who want to say they have visited a famous chef's restaurant.   Vegas is a foodie Mecca. Skip this one.  P.S. Several pictures show bread being served with the meal but we were never offered any. I also didn't see it on the menu. That looks pretty great, would have been nice to try.",

As much as I love to read other people's reviews, I have to say, not one experience is the same as another. Nor does everyone have the same tastes buds.  The appetizers alone, can be your main dish for the night due to the large proportions. I had ordered the shrimp cocktail and the size of the shrimps were huge ! The appetizer by itself had filled me up !  My boyfriend had ordered the grilled lamb burger, my mother-in-law ordered the mac and cheese, my father-in-law ordered the New York strip, and my bother-in-law ordered the lobster mini rolls.  All the dishes were fantastic, especially the mac and cheese and the lamb burger ! However, service was extremely slow.",

They ended up giving and extra one for free which was very nice of them. Service was great! It was super busy but still ended up getting a table within 15 min. The mashed mint puree was perfection..very refreshing with the fish and chips! I didn't drink but it looked like they had a huge beer selection on tap. Might have to come back here to try the beers.

The bartender behind the bar was an extremely friendly gentleman who, as I would learn, checked in frequently with all of the patrons and myself. He did a great job during the lunch hour under much duress.   I was much in the mood for a burger and fries despite the fact that the two gentleman on either side of me ordered the fish and chips, which looked very appealing.   This British-themed bar had Champions League soccer on the tele, and you could tell the bartender knew his soccer.  The burger I ordered was very good, and it came with standard fries. I noticed that the fish and chips came with steak fries. Kind of wished my order came with those instead of the shoe-string style.  I ordered a couple of German ales, and the beer was perfectly chilled.  Good visit! A little bit more expensive and the lunch-time clientele was dressed up a little more, but well worth the visit. When on vacation, there is no harm in splurging a little more, particularly when you double or triple your money at the sport book. Ha :-)",

I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and was afraid the restaurant wouldn't meet the hype but I am so glad it did. We got a couple appetizers including the scotch egg, mini lobster rolls, and mac and cheese. So flavorful and so good. I have to say the highlight was the fish and chips. I've never had fried fish that was so crispy and moist. Our server friend told us stories about how when Gordon stops by he casually talks to customers, and how the fish is not allowed to be cut until it's ordered. Whatever they are doing is working. The signature burger we got was amazing as well. And I got to enjoy my favorite beer, Innis & Gunn, which I found out from the menu is Gordon's favorite as well!",

We were quickly seated and the environment was that of a stylish English pub. I loved the setting as I was starving and there was amazing food along with a live collage football game.   The appetizers we had were the Maine lobster and shrimp rolls. This has to be one of the best appetizers have had. The roll was crispy yet soft and buttery. The lobster and shrimp spread was to die for and I wanted to keep ordering more and more of it. I had the famous fish and chips with a large glass of beer. Best food to watch a game with. The fresh cod was perfectly cooked and battered.  The cod was tasty and moist. The fries were soo good and the bowl of mashed peas was something I will always remember. My wife had the Salmon with fennel. She said it was really tasty and she licked the plate clean. She normally does not like her salmon oven roasted but when Gordon Ramsey create a dish, somehow he has you living things you don't normally like eating.  We will definitely come here again. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because the service could improve. The waitress we had seemed overwhelmed and I had to ask twice for ketchup before I finally got it. She also would not look towards our table a couple of times when I needed her. But overall the service was good but could improve.    We paid 131.62 for the appetizer, two dishes, large beer and a non alcoholic beverage.  Well worth the visit.",

The first time was fabulous, the second time it was awful and the third time (you ask, why we even gave it another chance? We had friends who really wanted to try it) was A-OK.   We made reservations for a late dinner for four people and we were shown to our table promptly when we arrived. I will say, we were seated at a 4 (low) top in the center of the restaurant and the chairs were 'sunken'/ worn (?) which doesn't really work well for a 5'2\" lady in a dress and heels trying to eat a meal. I felt I needed a booster seat and a bib.   Our server was pleasant and attentive and the food was good. We all were happy and tasted the meals amongst ourselves. What really made my day? Our guests enjoyed the event when I was worried about it.   Why only 3 stars you ask? This place is super inconsistent with it's food and service (plus the whole chair thing).",

    "text": "Mr. Ramsay!!! It's been a pleasure!   I've watched Hell's Kitchen, but only religiously during season 1 and 2. I highly enjoy the world of cooking and creating a meal that's enjoyable on all levels. I've wanted to eat at a Ramsay restaurant for some time now, and I finally got that chance!   Now, let's talk about the atmosphere. The decorations, the barrels (or maybe kegs?) on the walls, the lighting, the choice of color, the \"British Art Decor\" on the wall; all of it was highly appealing and fit for a \"British Pub and Dinner Grill environment\". It actually encouraged to eat. Even the dang menu was fancy and red and nice, and it was pushing me to try this stuff. I loved it.   Now let's get to the food. I ate 'Bangers and Mash' a traditional British meal consisting of sausages and potatoes, and this had been spruced up a bit for Ramsay's Establishment. It was a small portion (I can consume so much, so to my standards it was small), but the presentation was superb. The taste was amazing too, the potatoes were great and they deliciously went well with the three sausages I had! And those three babies had been cooked just right too, it was ridiculous.   I also tried a bit of the \"Rueben sand which\", a corned beef, rye breaded and Swiss cheesed (mind the grammar) American made meal. The Rueben was great; it fell apart nicely with one bite. Not too tough to overcome at all. The bread was soft and tasty and the meat tasted great as well.   Finally, I had some a delicious spot of some cake. Not too sure what it was but at first, it didn't look too appealing. And then man. Bit into that buggar and my mouth was having a holiday. Again, the quality was great and it came apart quite nice in my mouth, and the taste just overtook my tongue. It was not too sweet at all, it was probably one of the best desserts I've had for some time.   Now, price wise? Quite the tab, but quality definitely ran rampant in the meal I devoured. You definitely get some high quality chow that doesn't disappoint. I'm really starting to appreciate this sort of eating.   I also highly appreciated being able to eat some actual European themed food. It's not too often that you come upon a British or German restaurant. Heck, it's hard enough to find something Norwegian or Scottish. Most European themed places are Irish pubs for the most part. It was great to actually be cultured with some English recipes.   Would o return? Definitely would. My only disappointment was not being able to see Gordon Ramsay yell at some. But we can't all get everything we want.",

Pretzels were good, everything else was amazing. The nachos, what can I say. I will be dreaming of you. I loved you ever since the waiter placed you in front of me. No seriously, it was amazing. Deviled eggs... Those eggs should have been between two slices of bread... It was so damn delicious. Not sure if it's on the menu, but if it is, I'm all over it. The toad in a hole were too damn small. That's my only complaint!  They were so good... Check out the pics and my bill. Sorry, I totally forgot to snap a pic of the deviled eggs before devouring it. Hush, you guys are lucky I was able to hold back the gf to snap a pic before we dug in. I nearly lost a hand...  No joke.",

It felt as if they had to accommodate some huge party unexpectedly. Drinks took 15 mins.   My $40 tenderloin was overcooked but I dare not complain given the spotty service.  That aside, all food was very tasty. Fries I would guess are NOT house made - a slight disappointment.  You set high expectations but clearly you overextended. Shame on you, Ramsey!!! Service atrocious.  Some woman (not our server) delivered our truffle fry starter without even looking at our table -- almost dropped the plate. Thus was pretty aggregious.   Overall, food 4 stars, service (better yet, restaurant management, 1 star). I leave sad.",

My family was seated in the center with couches and a coffee table...that may have been fine for drinks only but definitely not ideal for a family of 6 eating together for dinner. We ordered drinks first, I got the blue skies drink....easily the star of the whole meal. When the waiter came around we asked for suggestions, I was already leaning towards the lamb burger when he mentioned it was his favorite on the menu so I ordered. When our food came I can say we all ate in relative silence, not because it was so good or we were starving, but because we we're so \"meh\" about the whole experience. My lamb burger was okay, the flavors weren't amazing and it was a little dry. Everyone else seemed to feel the same about their various meals. I think you're paying for the name on the building and menu as opposed to quality of food, which is disappointing. I would not come back here again, except maybe for round 2 of that drink.",

The waiter must have been scared to do his job because he kept glancing at our table and not stopping by. I watched him pass about 4 times before asking if we wanted water (uhm yes, it's Vegas and we need to stay hydrated), another 4 times before asking if we wanted drinks, and another 6 times before finally bringing them. He literally forgot to bring the beer and then quickly left again when we were clearly ready to order. It wasn't a busy night, so his flightiness was unexplainable.   This continued throughout the night. We needed salt/pepper, and the waiter continued to walk by hesitantly and not stop by asking how we are doing and if we needed anything. This might not seem like a huge deal, but no paying customer wants to feel avoided or neglected.   Also, he'll need to brush up on his adjectives and food reviews. When we asked about how their pea soup tasted, his only response was \"it has texture.\" WOW you sold us on that one.   For Gordon Ramsay's name.. The staff needs better game. Very surprising..  The steak was pretty fatty. I was starving at that point (since the waiter took a lifetime to commit to his job) and would've ate anything.",

At first glance you can see by the decor the theme they were going after; a charming casual place that served bold flavors. The menu was appropriately priced for Vegas and the food was modeled after a traditional English pub with keeping its American guests in mind. The beer list had a nice blend of English ales and some good American craft beers among the standard miller lite.   As for the food, I had the corned beef sandwich as a few bites of the lamb burger. Both were outstanding in flavor and well portioned. Having them accompanied by a 90 minute IPA, my lunch was set.   I give my recommendation and hope you have a chance to try it.",

Pie was too salty you could hardly taste the meat. The beer tastes a bit off too. Not how I remember it. The staff are. Decked out in this late 70's punkish type garb. Kinda weird but what ever floats Gordon's boat I guess.   Bottom line with what 3 Michelin stars after his name I would have expected more.  I also expected a little larger English beer selection. But oh well.   I won't go out of my way to come back but if I am at Caesar's again. I'll give it another go.",

The Sheppard's Pie was even mediocre :(  I would go there for a beer and chat with a bartender, but if I am looking to get a quick eat than I would rather go to Burgr.  Sorry Gordon......",

    "text": "Disappointing! My wife and I are big Ramsey fans and we religiously watch Kitchen Nightmares. We've both been to London and love Pub food, so we were very excited to go to the new Ramsey Pub.    First, the hostesses quoted an hour and a half wait even though it was off peak Sunday after 8, there were six to eight open tables and what appeared to be very few people waiting. They took my contact info and less than 30 minutes later the text came through that our table was ready. The early table was a pleasant surprise but it was obvious they weren't really keen at estimating accurate wait times.  Our server was friendly but not attentive. There were a number of times we had to wait a while before he returned to our table.  The Shepard's pie was bland and not very tasty at all.  The portion was very small, which wouldn't be a big deal if they weren't charging nearly $30. It was an entree price with a tapas/small plate portion size. Everything was way overpriced, the side of mushy peas was $11. $11 for a few ounces of mashed peas? And they weren't very good either.   Overall it wasn't a very positive experience and with Ramsey's name on it you certainly expect more.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan.  I have watched all his shows from BBC to Fox.  I have also dined at the London NYC and it was one of the best meals of my life.  Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill?  Not so much.  We waited at the bar for the text that our table was ready and the wait was the highlight of our experience.  Great drinks and friendly bar tender.  He made great recommendations of what to eat and seemed to know the menu well.  We were seated just after finishing our first drink which was perfect.  After that it was all downhill.  The table we sat at was directly behind the hostess both so it was a high traffic area but it was so close you could reach out and touch them.  Not only was it awkward placement but the table was far to short, both in height and depth, for the 2 chairs and booth that were pushed up to it.  Strange and uncomfortable, but I could get past it for great food and service.  Unfortunately we got very little of either.  The waiter was friendly enough and for some reason felt the need to share that he was a competitive eater (even called another staff member over to prove it).  Again, awkward, but whatever.  For an appetizer we ordered the Scottish Egg, as recommended by the bar tender, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  There were 3 of us, we had the Prime Rib, Diver Scallops, and Fish and Chips.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very good (best entree ordered), the batter on the Fish and Chips was flavorful but slid right off the fish, which was tasteless, and the french fries didn't have any salt at all.  The Prime Rib was extremely bland but the mash potatoes were pretty decent.  For desert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was definitely the star of our dining experience.  I have watched Gordon make it on TV for years and was very happy that I wasn't disappointed.    For what I have reviewed so far I would have given 3 stars but the service is where it really fell flat.  Every single dish we used from our drinks, to the apps, to dinner, to desert were all still on the table when we left the restaurant.  We were out of drinks, even water, 45 min before we got our check, which I had to wave our waiter down to request and then it still took another 20 minutes before we got it.  Outside of taking our order and delivering food he only stopped at our table to check on us once the whole hour and 45 minutes that we were seated.  I saw the manager at the hostess both several times and tried to get his attention to inform him of our experience but he never would make eye contact.  Normally I would have got up and went to him but at this point I was annoyed and just wanted to leave.  Needless to say for a meal that cost over $170 (not including the $60 we spent at the bar) I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  This is a restaurant worthy of Gordon's show Kitchen Nightmares!  What a shame.  I hope, Scott Commings (Hell's Kitchen season 12 winner) will turn things around when he takes the head Chef position and hopefully that is soon!",

I  was going to have dinner there but after my lunch experience I decided to go to Hugo's cellar on Freemont st (highly recommend) All I was looking for was something light to hold me over for awhile so my brother and I ordered just some soup I had the chicken leek with broad noodles and truffle fries off the happy hour menu. my nephew had a bacon burger and Fries my brother had a bowl of split pea. my soup was bland and flavorless more like grease and water only two curl noodle not broad. the fries were like Mcdonalds with some and a small some of truffle spray my nephew only ate half of his burger so my bro and I took a few bites and to say the least not impressed again very little flavor the bacon was a little under cooked. All they sell there is the name. You better off at the lobby bar and grill in the hotel. I mean if they can't do soup and burgers for lunch than dinner is out of the question. Its was Hells kitchen alright.. Bloody Hell Gordan.",

Hubby had fish and chips. The fish was not seasoned at all. The batter was crunchy but amateur chefs can get crunchy. Here is a tip: try salt. I had the lobster macn cheese. Solely based on this I'd have given it 3 stars. Better than fish n chips. Lots of lobster but mac n cheese was blander than it could have been. I had much better lobster mac at House of Blues. The staff seemed to be working hard but we had to wait forever for drinks and for the server in general. The bus boy was awesome though. Kept our waters filled and table taken care of. Fish n chips: 2 Mac n cheese: 3 Service: 2.5  Hugely disappointed that a restaurant with GR's name would be so lacking!",

Then they texted me, \"Your table is ready.\"  I walk up to the Hostess and she said, \"get in line.\"  I told her I already waited in line and my table is ready.  Apparently, \"Your table is ready\" doesn't really mean that at all.  I had to wait in the same line I first had to wait in to put my name in for a reservation!!  So after pulling me from the bar (drinks are not cheap either!), I had to wait another 15 minutes in line to get to my table!  I should have left then, but I really wanted to try Gordon Ramsay's food.  I first let the waiter know the issue they have at the front, and his response was, \"You got to expect that.\"  WHAT?!  Serious?  No I do not.  We stayed, but the food wasn't worth the wait either.  I hope this helps your decision making whether to eat here.  I would never go back.",

The evening before we enjoyed a FANTASTIC dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab (It's in Caesars...run...don't walk to this place if you want a wonderful dining experience)   So... we figured we would give this place a try, the menu price wise is about the same as Joe's, we expected something close to the level of service Joe's offers.... BOY we we wrong!    The waitress sat us and the bench seat I was in sank down like an old worn out sofa... it was awkward to dine in.   She brought us an Ipad for the drink menu and didn't really go over the ordering process... we figured it out and pressed on.   I ordered the mixed grill which comes with a couple of shrimp, pork belly, and a fillet.  When the food arrived the side dish we ordered did not show up. No apology, the guy just said he would go back and the dish would be out in 5 min. My wife ordered the Scallops with polenta...  Her scallops were not bad but the polenta was nonexistent ... her bowl looked empty LOL a few scallops and faint smear of polenta.  My meal... the steak was over cooked, it had a good flavor but wasn't nearly as good as the fillet I had at Joe's the night before. The pork-belly was the best thing in the dish and the shrimp were very plain... lacked any seasoning.   About half way through the meal we stopped eating... called over the waitress who hadn't followed up about the missing side dish.  She went back... said it would be out in 5 min.  Again... no apology... nada.  Then she went on drifting around the place not doing much of anything.  We waited a little longer... said screw it and finished our meals.  Not once during the meal did the waitress check on us... offer to get us additional drinks... nada.    As soon as we finished the meal... the guy shows up with the side.  I politely let him know we didn't want it... we had finished our meals. About 10 min later the waitress drops off the check... minus the side and says have a good night.  Again... never admitting there was an issue... just treated us like the millionth pain in the ass tourist she has served.   For a $150 + meal... you would expect better food and better service.    This place was a huge letdown.  I only wish I would have read the Yelp reviews prior to wasting our time and money at this 2 star establishment.  I've had better meals and service and chain restaurants.   Again... if you want a great meal... with great service... I highly recommend you walk on down to Joe's on the 1st level of Caesar's Palace. You will not be disappointed.   (PS...   Frank",

The food was awful and I was going to let it slide, until I ran into the service at Gordon Ramsay's burger place today and lost it. This review is for the Pub & Grill though, located in Caesar's Palace on the Vegas strip.    We came for dinner and had high expectations, as you would imagine considering the brand name. Each of us ordered $70 steaks and they were almost inedible.  There was obviously no preparation of the steaks since they were rubbery, had no flavor, and the cuts were worse than the clearance aisle at your local grocery store. I was starving so I woefully scarfed down my ribeye a la propane.  Seriously, all I could taste was chemicals in my steak. Mr. Ramsay needs to visit his own places and do a tough introspection.  Or maybe TV just pays better.",

It tasted delicious and came with various pickled items like asparagus, tomatoes, and an actual pickle. It also had pieces of salami so it all balanced out with the drink. Now when the Beef Wellington came out, that was awesome! The meat will literally melt in your mouth. Everything in that plate was delicious.

My wife had some nachos made with potato chips.  She said the chips were crisp and not greasy.  My friends had short ribs( shared) and poutine and a wedge salad.  They enjoyed everything.  They had a 100.00 dining credit for being Total rewards Diamond members so they were able to use that for the meal.    Overall, it was an OK meal, however I do feel a lot of the dishes are very overpriced.",

We went for lunch and were promptly seated ~ Guinness $16 ~ Mocha martini $15 ~ Truffle fries with truffle aioli $12 ~ Salmon toast $9 ~ Butter chicken curry served with rice, naan and yogurt $28 ~ Sticky toffee pudding served with icecream.  Drinks were nice martini had chocolate, baileys and kahlua. Nailed the butter chicken just the right amount of spice. Truffle fries on point, salmon was fresh and light. Service is Excellent and Food is Delicious.  Don't miss out on the Sticky toffee pudding. Gotta Love Ramsay's food and definitely check out one of his restaurants.  Cheers!",

You were able to get seats at the bar without a wait. Our bartender who looked like a lumberjack was super cool and helpful with a lot of Vegas tips. I ordered the beef pot pie which was absolutely perfect. My husband ordered a burger and fries which was good. I stole some of his fries and dipped them in the mayo which was home made and a little garlicky.   I thought the houndstooth shirts worn by the waiters were ugly compared to how they dress the hostesses and waitresses were much better kind of like the spy who shagged me. It's a little pricey I think our bill was over $60 with 3 beers but I did not expect it to be cheap. The bartender said Gordon Ramsay visits all his restaurants every other month or so",

I'm still a fan of his but he should really really be ashamed; price gouging people for meh to bad food is so disappointing.

We both had a drink at $11 a piece for an Angry Orchard and some other craft beer. Ordered the Kettle Chip Nachos as an App and they were alright with cheese, shredded beef, sour cream, and some pickled sweet peppers on top. The chips were hot as if they came freshly fried and was pleasantly surprised.   My dinner on the other hand was kind of a let down at $39.00. I ordered the Beer Braised Short Rib meal that came with mashed potatoes, grilled carrots, and a brown sauce. The beef was the same meat that came on the nachos and was completely tasteless and bland. It tasted like bland pot roast out of a crock pot. I couldn't pick up any beer accents and it definitely needed salt and some seasoning.   My husband loved his meal as he got the special that night of Gordon's famous Beef Wellington for $55. He was extremely impressed and very satisfied with his dinner. My dinner made me sort of depressed instead.",

I'm not a Gordon Ramsay fan, so none of that hoopla did anything for me. Instead, I am a huge fan of English fare like Pimms cups and mushy peas that I can't find decent versions anywhere in CA.

Point is that if you don't do it well, don't put it on your menu. The atmosphere at this location is very noisy and cramped.

My sister got the lamb burger and I got the fish and chips. The other 3 got the burger. We also go pretzels to munch on while we were waiting. It came with 2 sauces - course mustard and cheese. They looked hard but were very soft.   Food took a while but it was very great. When I got my fish and chips, i said I could eat more than it but in fact, I couldn't even finish! The waiter said that their fish is never frozen and I believe it. It was firm, yet flaky. The batter was perfection. The only thing was the \"chips\" were more like roasted potatoes (not crispy) but were still good in their own right. Mushy peas were fresh with a hint of mint. The TARTAR SAUCE (!!) was very creamy and clearly homemade. It was worth the cost ($29).  I tried my sister's lamb burger and the spices were not appealing for me, but she loved it.  Lastly, we tried the toffee pudding ($10) after the rave reviews! It did not disappoint! It was more like cake consistency than pudding and came with sweet cream ice cream. The server pours the toffee sauce on top. So so good!",

Sides were cold and the steaks came well over cooked. The food took ages and the server was a right tosser. Come on Gordon, get your bloody act together and sort this place out.

You have so many elements just giving it a overall astetic pub masterpiece.   As far as food goes, I would try the butter chicken curry. My favorite is the Lamb burger, the coleslaw gives a good crunchy texture when you bite into it. The feta sauce goes well with the lamb. A lamb burger must, it also pairs perfectly with their Dog fish 60 minute. You can really get a hightened taste of the lamb with every sip.",

Customer service & food:   The lady approached us pouring water with no greeting. We asked about the Happy Hour info, she kept flipping the menu we were reading then disappeared and came back with the page opened.  Our waiter came with no intro, instead just asked us if we had any questions or not. Then we ordered the Shepherds Pie, the Steak & Ale Pie and happy hour Truffle Chips.   Food came within 5 minutes. That's impressively fast for starving people. Food tasted very good!  We 2 persons did the Yelp check-in with a free sticky toffee pudding. The waiter brought in 1 portion only. After he checked with his colleague. He came back and said they offered 1 per table. That's ok, but hope they indicate this restriction on the redeem page.  Never knew his name until persons seated next to us. As he did a full introduction to them with recommendations. We found funny that a waiter mentioned to the customers that certain dishes he did not suggest as they weren't his favourite. Lol...  I definitely won't return to this restaurant especially after the dining experiences in Gordon Ramsay Steak and the Fish & Chips one.  Btw I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay's!!!",

My boyfriend ordered the steak, he likes them VERY well done, but they brought it back still red inside. Elise was very accommodating and brought it back to cook a bit longer. Unfortunately it was still red inside when he got it back. Third times the charm and finally it was perfect!  Everything was delicious and the sauces were super tasty. The manager (didn't get his name) came out to chat with us and was really kind.  We finally tried the sticky toffee pudding which was the best part of the meal! SO moist, I almost died.

    "text": "Everyone's a critic, I know. Especially Gordon Ramsay. We were coming here after a late showing of Celine Dion at the Caesar's Palace and were excited to give it a try. Despite the number of people coming out of the concert and going towards the restaurants for food, we were seated quite quickly (within 5 minutes or so?).  This particular restaurant of his specializes in English pub food. So you get your steaks, fries, shepherd's pie, many others. All very enticing as you look over the menu. I appreciated the quick service with the attentive staff to my water and other amenities! Anyways, sat down ordered a prime rib and a shepherd's pie with the intention to share with a plate of poutine to start! The poutine came out quickly. Hot and dripping the way we like it. The cheese curds and fries were awesome along the strips of beef. The gravy unfortunately was overly salted making this the first time I didn't want to finish my poutine =(.  Unfortunately by that time of night they were out of prime rib. No worries. I switched over to butter chicken which is an English take on an Indian curry. Quite nice actually but the shepherd's pie was quite the disappointment. The mince meat was a little on the runny side and needed some umphf to the seasoning. The mashed potatoes on top needed some season as well. If only the poutine and shepherd's pie mingled a bit.  It's too bad that the food here weren't just a little better as I would have loved to try the dessert. At that point in the dinner other than the butter chicken, I was disappointed. Service and ambience were great but food was a little flat to \"meh.\" Plenty of other restaurants to check out around here that open late so I might given them a gander before you settle on this place!",

Im 100% sure Gordon Ramsay would have not served these items to us cold, and tasted dry.

Turned a tough experience into a good one and I'm more than satisfied with the outcome. Looking forward to a visit on my next trip to Vegas.   ---  It'd be far too easy to throw out a classic Ramsay one-liner about what was wrong about this. But suffice to say that he should be livid about what is being done under his name. We came here for lunch with a small group in between meetings we had.   We had 75 mins to eat but it's lunch and no one was ordering appetizers. Should be easy, right? Well this place figured out a way to mess that up.   Drinks came out well after ordering.   Food came out over 45 minutes after ordering. Half of the dishes were lukewarm at best. The fries were limpy. And the waitress would disappear for long stretches. Water glasses not filled.   And then my Caesar salad? It was about as good as the to-go salad I got at the airport. Which was a rip-off at $9 then. But this one was $23! The chicken was cold and probably sitting in a fridge overnight. Missed anchovies. When the Anchovies arrived, they were virtually flavorless! Were they canned in water? The croutons were... oh you get the idea.   By far the most disappointing place we've eaten at in Vegas. For these prices, just go to the food court next door. You'll get better food and cheaper and won't miss your session when the meal takes 90 minutes.   As the. Chef has said\"Hey panini head, are you listening to me?\"",

We were seated immediately and served cold water which was in bottles on ice out front...noticed when they bought more from the back they were pre-chilled...(nice attention to detail).  Server was attentive and timely. We both ordered fish and chips, and a side of Mac and cheese. All were served promptly. The fish was probably the best I have ever had, flaky hot and fresh! Portion was average at 2 medium sized pieces. Served with very good fries, very small tartar sauce and a side of pureed green peas(?) which I passed on. The Mac and cheese tasted very good but was lukewarm. I sent it back, which was done gracefully and quickly, but the exchanged dish was not much warmer.  The bill including tip was $92. We just had water to drink. The fish and chips were $30 each, which seemed quite high, but we were hungry and were short on time. I am going to try one of his fast food outlets at the Linq and other places to see if the fish is the same but at a lower price.",

Server took his time picking up the check (10+ minutes) and most of our dining party ended up leaving.   The fish and chips were delicious. The fish was not over battered or greasy which are my general complaints about this fish, but these pieces of cod were lightly battered and crunchy. The cod was flaky and fresh.   Bottom line: good place to grab lunch but don't come if you're in a hurry.",

Food was great, we had a burger + fish and chips. Hands down the best fish and chips I've ever had. Perfectly battered; crispy without being greasy. However, the chips weren't quite as good as I had hoped. They weren't quite as crispy as I had hoped for.  The -.5 star is because of the lackluster chips and inconsistent service. However, I'm rounding up to 5 because it's basically a 5. I would definitely recommend this place.",

But not at this place, this is the only reason why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. The burger was basic, nothing special. I mean, it wasn't bad, we just expected something similar to his other location. A dish that was 5/5 was the short rib, every bite made our mouths water. So much flavor! The pork belly was good, the sauce made it better. Overall a little on the pricey side, but this is Vegas and how often do you go to a Ramsay restaurant? Definitely recommend, just stay away from the burger. If you want a good burger experience go to the Gordon Ramsay Burger restaurant.  Service was 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5",

    "text": "I will never not be bitter about the $19 Caesar salad.   This salad is the embodiment of Gordo's \"Kitchen Nightmares\" career before the great restaurant and menu makeover.  For $19, you will experience: about 1/4 head of lettuce, 3 croutons and some bland dressing that is indistinguishable from literally any supermarket dressing. That was it. That was the full salad.   My dudes. Less than $3 can recreate this at Wal-Mart.   Look, the beef wellington is good. Great, even. For more than $50 for a tiny portion (in what I remind you claims to be a \"pub and grill\"), it had damn well better be.   Everything else about this place is a damn rip-off, and not one that you can even convince yourself is \"worth it because it's Vegas.\" A single Scotch egg (which is apparently UK-speak for \"flavorless dry meat surrounding an egg\") will run at least $11. Your draft beer will also run at least $11.   Ambiance? Meh. It would be the same fine, generic decor of your local TGIFridays if not for the fact that the design plus the music sucks up sound, so you will find yourself literally shouting at the person across the table from you to be heard.   Props to the waitstaff, though, who were friendly, enthusiastic and trying to make the best of a bad situation.",

    "text": "First, let's talk design. As an Anglophile I of course love the decor- the bar has the London red iconic phone booths theme, and photos of British bulldogs abound- even on some chairs. My favorite touch, however, is the wall of kegs. This is definitely a pub atmosphere, so do not arrive expecting an upscale ambience.  Next, the service is impeccable. Greeted and sat immediately by a beautiful and friendly hostess, then greeted by a server/assistant who gave us a choice of still or sparkling water, and then our very professional and knowledgeable waiter arrived, with food and drink suggestions. Our choices arrived quickly, our water refreshed consistently, and our waiter had the right balance of attentiveness/respect for privacy. Very impressed. Finally, the food. We started with Corned Beef Poutine and I am not exaggerating to say I could eat this every day- absolutely delicious. I chose the Lobster Mac n-Cheese appetizer as an entree, it was certainly large enough for a full meal and it was equally delicious. I also enjoyed a Belgian Margarita, but warning, it is a bit tart. My husband raves about the Shepherds Pie.  The prices are high enough to save this place for special occasions, but it is one of the more affordable options in Caesars Palace. They did offer a 3-course menu at a special price, if one is looking for a deal. But truly, the food is fantastic and worth the expense.",

    "text": "Ok, so my final Gordon Ramsay fan-girl experience review is GR Pub & Grill. Honestly, it's a 4.5 and my least favorite of my GR restaurant visits, but obviously still pretty excellent!  I came for my first taste of that flaky, tender Beef Wellington, that the hubs and I always see on television and I got just that. Next time, I'll probably just go to Hell's Kitchen for it, (no issue, just a vibe preference when spending big bucks) but I digress. It was divine. The meat was tender and juicy, while the outer pastry was perfectly flaky. How do they do that?  We ordered the Prix Fixe Christmas Day menu and LOVED IT! Scallops, Beef Wellington, and rum bread pudding.  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese, just to give it a whirl-- because Gordon Ramsay!  The lobster cooked to perfection, and perfectly plated (loved the full claw), but the mac and cheese itself wasn't my favorite -- hence the -.5.  I used my check in offer on Yelp (thanks guys) to give the free toffee pudding a try, and absolutely loved it. Also, the ice cream atop was EVERYTHING! (Sidebar: Who the heck is making GR's ice cream-- I need to know!)  Our server (with the the mole on her brow) was an angel and worked the room like a certified champ.   All in all, the \"public house\" vibe is alive and well here, the decor is spot on, and the details are killer (check out my photo of the cutlery--yaasss!) and consistent with the expectation.   Another win for this GR fangirl!",

While I expect celeb chef prices at these joints in Vegas, I've often been disappointed. Never the case at a GR restaurant (see my GR Steak review).  While someone in your party is required by GR law to have the pub burger (with bacon, or course), don't skip the soft shelled crab sandwich, scotch eggs and pork belly- all winners. I've had GR's Wellington and scallops at other locations and haven't gotten to them here yet. I did have the fish and chips here and found it less flavorful and crispy as it was at GR steak. It was still pretty damn good! The spot is right in the middle of the casino and does get busy during lunch and dinner hours so make reservations!",

As a solo diner, a lot of my enjoyment of a restaurant comes from the quality of service and interaction between me & the staff. My server was Rodney & he was very attentive, efficient & a pleasure to talk to! He also helped me narrow down my menu choice and made sure I was enjoying my meal. The rest of the staff was awesome as well, all very friendly & focused on making sure the customers were happy. I look forward to returning on my next trip!  One quick tip; do yourself a favor and save room for the Sticky Toffee Pudding. No words to describe how good it is!!",

    "text": "There is no shortage of celebrity food spots in Las Vegas.  A coworker really wanted to try Hell's Kitchen but we found out it doesn't open until winter 2018.  The steak place was way too expensive so we opted for Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill.  I was able to make a reservation on Open Table and that was so easy to do.  Since walking in Las Vegas takes 3 times as long due to the various pedestrian bridges and the miles of loops you have to do to walk the casino floor, the Open Table was perfect as I had to push it back 15 minutes when we realized we were still not there!  We had a tiny wait when we got there but were seated relatively quickly.  There were 3 of us and we asked upfront to split the bill.  We each decided on a cocktail and two apps instead of an entree but then we wanted the lobster mac and cheese and right away our server Elise asked us if we wanted to split that amount in 3 on our checks.  She was so perceptive about our dilemma it was much appreciated.  I had their popular cocktail Goodbye Blue Sky and it was delicious.  I also had the calamari and wings.  I had a bite of my tablemate's samplings which also included nachos and pork belly.  Everything was good, about to be expected from a hyped up restaurant trying to serve the masses.  I couldn't finish and didn't want to waste so I took the leftovers back for a midnight snack.  Yummy and fun.",

    "text": "So nice we visited twice.   Finding this place was the happiest of total accidents. My group and I were just wandering around and happened to be hungry just before walking past this fun little Pub & Grill. Thankfully it was still pretty early in the evening so we were seated right away and camped out to watch the Astros beat the Yankees in game 1 of the ALCS. I'm not saying that solidified this place in the history of my life as a winner, but I'm also not not saying that. We helped ourselves to the Happy Hour menu and watched the restaurant fill up as we enjoyed pretzels with some amazing beer cheese dip, truffle fries with the perfect amount of truffle and a side of some kind of delicious truffle aioli, sliders and more. The name of my drink escapes me currently, but it's Gordon Ramsay's take on a Gin & Tonic (except I got mine with vodka instead because Gin is ew). So refreshing and slightly cheaper before dinner starts.  Everything in this place looks awesome, including the staff. The silverware is also pretty rad - makes you feel like you're at a medieval times feast.  Our second visit was equally as interesting with a lot of the same food and my husband ordering the birthday cake milkshake. It's basically a meal in a shake, complete with a cupcake on top. It also came with candles, which our server was happy to light for us.   Perhaps my only complaint is that Gordon himself didn't emerge from the kitchen to insult my entire life's existence. Next time, I hope.",

We also tried to order the pub pretzels and told we couldn't order them until 12:30 (place opened at 11/this was about 11:45) because they make them fresh every day. ?!?! So they don't make food to serve when the place opens? Then.. not ten minutes later (not noon yet)saw an order arrive at another table.

    "text": "we went to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. It is the True Mecca for foodies. Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree \"is this good enough for you\". I literally wanted to put the food up his U KNOW WHAT but we were hungry and would have been late for our show so we had to put up wth this clown. While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT \" of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable. I was so irritated with this snarky, pompous jack ass of a waiter it was all I could do to contain myself. The one plus was dessert some kind of bread pudding that was super sweet but definitely the best among the items ordered . Just when I thought things were bad enough I went into the rest room. Had I done that first thing, I would NEVER have eaten at this establishment. It was FILTHY. Yes! you may find it hard to believe, I DID but the smell and look of the toilet was as if they had not cleaned it. Rather disgusting what was on the toilet seat thus I will NOT describe it in case you are as visual as I am. I still can't get the imagery out of my mind a month later. When it came to soap supplies, they had 1 little bottle of soap for 4 sinks and plenty of patrons waiting like kindergardeners to get a squirt of the stuff. A 50 plus year old to my left erupted and questioned the staff and was seen on my way out complaining to upper management. Tell you what, for such a fussy chef with his noteriety of perfectionistic standards, he should visit the place he sold his name to on the sly and see for himself. A real let down and all around dive with absolutely lazy staff that needs a major attitude over haul. I would never recommend this place.",

We had been to his restaurant in the Paris Hotel the year before and absolutely loved it.   The was good, however there were some issues with the service which is why my rating is low. We were sitting towards more towards the outside of the restaurant, closest to the interior of the casino. During our dinner, a holiday giveaway was going on inside of the Casino and crowds started to appear right by the restaurant. At one point, people's behinds were practically in our faces! Also, people were coming into the restaurant and started crowding us as well. I could barely enjoy my food as this was annoying and none of the staff said anything or did anything about it. I heard another woman behind us complain but apparently nothing was done about it.  As stated, the food was good, but the entire experience was ruined as a result of this \"crowding.\" Hopefully, in the future, the staff will address this type of situation so as not to ruin the dining experience.",

Anyways I wasn't going to write a review until my wife went there with some friends that were in town yesterday. Just like most people that try the place, we all expect it to be great since the guys name on the sign is such a jerk if the food isn't perfect on his tv show. When a restaurant can't even cook a hamburger correctly, there's got to be much bigger issues. My wife's raw hamburger seems like every episode of that tv show that I have ever seen. The cooks can't even cook a hamburger? Service has been subpar there and the price is not worth the food quality. I was hoping our first experience was just an off night but a year later it proved to be another let down. Oh and while my wife and her friends were waiting for a table they sat down in the bar area to have a drink and not a single server/employee helped them. So another loss of revenue for this place, but I am sure the guys name on the sign will get his royalty check or else someone will be in trouble!",

    "text": "We were at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill on opening night. Nice atmosphere. Food was great. We saw a few celebrity chefs. I forgot to submit my original review after returning home and we have eaten at his restaurant again since. My original review was 5 star amazing but I have to say that our visit a few months later was not as great. Just 3 star ok. We were a little disappointed with the food. My husband and I both ordered the same items Fish and Chips and the Cauliflower soup both times and I felt the quality and attention to detail was not as good compared to or original visit. Probably because the chef himself was not there the second time... who knows... That being said, I would probably eat her again for a late night meal but not when looking for a nice dinner date night.",

    "text": "This was our first time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and we were excited to try it.  For appetizers, we ordered Pork & Duck Rilletes which was very tasty.  (We had never had Rilletes before so we don't have anything to compare).  They also give you  a small bread course for free.  My main course was the Mixed Grill.  It contained steak, pork belly and shrimp.  I loved it.  It was the best steak I had ever had, so tender!  The shrimp are large and juicy.  My husband ordered the flat iron steak.  He said the flavor was great, but when he received it, it was barely lukewarm so it was cold before he could finish it.  The sides are separate but we both ordered smashed fingerling potatoes.  Black truffle makes this dish absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This literally made my eyes roll back in to my head!  It was so heavenly.  My husband also tried a few of their tap beers.  The service was excellent!  They constantly checked up on us and were very attentive.  As packed as the place was, I was amazed by that.  Expect to drop some cash (almost $200 for both of us) but it was worth it in our eyes.   There were only two negatives...  his steak being barely lukewarm and the music was SO loud that we had a hard time talking.  They play music by British artists. . However, they get props from me for playing Depeche Mode.  :) We will DEFINATELY be back!",

My ribeye was medium rare and was somehow still chewy, thin, and lacked any flavor. We repeatedly had to ask for items our server failed to bring. Sodas were flat. Some items like the Shepards pie were so small, they shouldn't have been on the dinner menu and rather, belonged on the appetizers menu.",

After reading the reviews I was having a second thought wether I want to stop by for lunch. But thank god I did! Our server Sarah was amazing! She helped us order and everything was awesome! She's very funny and knowledgeable of the menu. For the appetizer she recommended the lobster roll that my boyfriend and I shared. Noted that my boyfriend doesn't like lobster but after trying the lobster roll he really enjoyed it! And for the main course Sarah recommended fish and chips and med rare lamb burger! And I have to say that it was one of the best burger that I have ever tried! After the main course we ordered sticky toffee pudding to share and it didn't disappointment us and it was delicious! Beside having the best food! The service was amazing! Our server made sure that we were having the best time and she gave 110% customer service! No complain we will definitely come back! Great food! Wonderful experience!",

They did however notice and get me a free drink and I didn't even say anything.  +1 point for being aware and preemptive.  They do give some bread service with assorted pretzels and butter and horseradish cheese that rivals the Culinary Dropouts pretzel appetizers.  And it's just the bread!  The food was worth the wait.  The potato puree was so rich and delicious.  The chicken was perfect.  The drink menu is on an iPad and the four that I tried were all spot on.  Enjoy!",

Service was also very slow and our pub table was very tall making it difficult to eat comfortably. We love Gordon Ramsey's tv show and were hoping for excellence. For a man who reprimands people for lack of taste, flavor, and service, we were expecting more. We will not be back to eat at this restaurant.",

However, on this occasion, the dinner started out on a bad foot. We ordered wine, which the servicer promptly delivered to us. My wife's glass wasn't clean. So, we told the servicer, who quietly took the glass away and bought my wife another glass. Again, the glass had a sticky film inside. So, we told the servicer and that's when the attitude started. He took the glass without any apology and disappeared for well over 10 minutes. So, we started to leave, when the host called the manager, Randell Goldich, who saved our evening by one apologizing, and two, by providing a server (Stacy B.), who gave us exceptional service thorough the dinner service. The food was excellent. I'll will definitely return to one of my favorite TV celebrity's (Gordon Ramsay) restaurant. This is a clear case of not allowing one bad apple to spoil the bunch.",

After the experience at this highly recommended restaurant we will NEVER go to another one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants again. First off the hostess said it was a 30-40 min wait time so I gladly gave her my number and went to have a drink next door while we waited for her text message, after 1 hr I walked by to go use the restroom which was close by the restaurant I noticed there was not many people waiting in line so I went back to my boyfriend and finally after waiting 1hr and 30 mins I went up to the hostess and asked what was going on it had been 1hr+ she stayed  oh I don't know  \"sorry thought it sent\" I told her that was ridiculous and she went ahead and sat us only because we were clearly irritated with her non professional response after sitting we waited 20 mins for our server I then had to flag someone down to attend to us finally our \"waiter\" came took our appetizers and drinks down and never returned. Other servers were coming by to ask if we needed anything! We were extremely disappointed with this place in fact we gave our \" waiter a $6 tip\" and we gave another waiter who was actually doing a great job a great tip! To top it off the food was not great it was ok but not great like I have heard! perhaps they were referring to the other restaurants because this one definitely did not do anything but makes us never want to return!",

She was friendly and efficient, and correct on the recommendation. Both items, while simple, were done to perfection. The chips were about a third of a potato or more each, and you got eight, so quite a bit of potato. They were crispy on the outside and just right on the inside. The house made ketchup was good enough to eat without putting it on the chips. It was my first scotch egg, so I don't have much to compare, but I enjoyed the contrast of the spicy sausage, egg, and slightly molten yoke. yum!",

No complaints on service.   There were 3 of us. Our bill came to approximately $120 after taxes. We ordered a beer $11, 6 wings $13 and for entree's we ordered the burger $21, steak pie $25 and fish and chips $30. While we all enjoyed our dishes it was more of a novelty and probably won't be back.   If you have a good appetite the steak pie wasn't very filling as it was small in portion and no sides to accommodate the dish.     Overall, good food and a good experience!",

I had the wedge, and I believe my friend had the Cobb, and both were wonderful! Someone in our group had the lamb burger and thought it was great!

Im a fan of Chef Ramsey from watching all this TV shows but he really should give this particular spot more attention or sell it. Don't put your name on it Gordon!   His fish n chips little shop by the Vegas Roller is 100X tastier. You know why? Cuz their food is made fresh and served right away. It is temperature hot. A minimum expectation.   Thumbs down.

I don't think I have ever felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my entire life. We went at a non-peak time, restaurant half empty, just to grab a couple of drinks. We told the hostesses and waiters we were just getting drinks. Took nearly 30 minutes to get first drink order. Then our waiter complained about us to hostess since we were not ordering food. He grabbed everything off our table and was super short with us. Hostess then came over and apologized and said we weren't being rushed out, but could move to another table. Since we were done with our drinks, we just opted to leave. I would have loved to come back, but there is no point. I am not a fussy diner, I don't send food back and never write negative reviews but, this really ruined an experience for me that I was actually really looking forward to.",

On two separate occasions I called the restaurant to confirm that we could bring the baby. Upon our arrival at 4:50 p.m., the hostess snarkily told us to come back at 5 p.m., the time of the reservation, and we would be seated. Ouch! Mind you, there were tables everywhere but we did as we were told. Once seated, our baby was sleeping and would have remained asleep had our waiter not taken it upon himself to move her stroller from where the hostess told us we could park it. From the get go, our server was visibly irritated that we would have the audacity to bring a baby to this restaurant. From there it went from bad to worse. Here are some highlights... the food (corn soup, English peas) was not even warm; anytime we asked for anything (a straw, a glass of cranberry juice, an oyster fork) we never got it; HORRIBLE service combined with lackluster food does not justify a $256 price tag. When the manager asked how our experience was we were honest and told him and he responded by offering free dessert which we took to go. The one menu item I'd recommend is the sticky toffee pudding.",

    "text": "This was my first experience at a Gordon Ramsay establishment.  I have heard around LV that he is a very nice guy and since this particular eatery opened I had heard excellent reviews.  I was very disappointed when I went to this pub because I was looking forward to it.  My server was very nice and attentive enough during the visit, although she could not recommend any of the bottled beers to my friends because the establishment will not let their staff try any of the bottled beverages.  That is odd to me that the establishment will not take the time or money to train their staff on bottled beers they carry no matter if they carry 2 or eighty.  Regardless, the next thing that was weird to me is that there are no substitutions for fries even if you offer to pay more.  I went with it thinking no matter because I was certain my burger would be out of this world but nope, it was just a regular burger and not even that flavorful or good.  All the food ordered by my friend was also very average.  My friends shepherd's pie had literally two peas in it exactly, and my friends fries were just regular McDonald's looking fries.  The dessert was also very average for a mousse trifle.  I could make the same thing with different flavor pudding mixes and whipped topping.  I'm so surprised because I truly thought this would be a great place to eat and try.  I felt like an idiot because I am the one who chose the place to eat.  My friends were also disappointed.  Looking at the yelp reviews I can't believe so many people gave so many stars!?  How did that happen???",

I probably should have been given a choice or at least told there are two menus.  I will often eat \"dinner\" at a bar not just bar food.  So I ordered the Pork Belly.  Unbelievabe.  It was unique, extremely flavorful but surprisingly light.   That coupled with the bar tenders attentive service and the great selection of beers it was a good night out.

The signature scallop dish recommended by our server was small and below Red Lobster quality (think Shoney's or something along those lines), the chicken pot pie tasted like a frozen meat pie.  No joke, it was really lousy and the loud mouth celebrity chef should be ashamed to have his name attached to it.  It's a restaurant worthy of a reality show and perhaps that's the point because I can't think of a better reason to open a new restaurant in the middle of a busy casino that is so awful and completely overpriced for the poor quality food served up.  Service was equally uninspired, the girl that brought our dishes to us was flat out frightening and surly, our main server seemed completely out of it as well.  Overall we felt completely unsatisfied with our meals and ripped off even by Vegas pricing standards.  Yuck! Totally disappointing considering we'd had a great meal at Ramsay's BurGR two days earlier.  I understand that The Pub was supposed to be Gordon's outlet for serving up his own favourites so I can only assume he's acquired a taste for the fare he samples when he arrives on set at Kitchen Nightmares. It's that bad.  The decor was cool but.. that's the only thing thing this place has going for it... period.",

We had to ask him every time, as he did not leave it at, or near the table for us.  My hubby was looking forward to a nice burger...There is not a burger on the menu.  He goes to London twice a year, and said, there is no pub in London that doesn't have a burger on its menu.  When our meals arrived, we were very very surprised with the small portions.  The shephards pie portion looked like a small appetizer.  The guy that had it, said he had never been to a place where he had to fill up on bread.  The food was tasty, but very over priced for what you get.  The desserts were delicious.  About the only positive thing, all 4 of us had to say about the pub, was the dessert was good.  Service was very poor, and our waiter pretty much ignored us.  The next day, all 4 of us said, we would never go back again.  Very over rated.   I should also mention, we have been to Ramsays burger place in Planet Hollywood, and loved it.  Also to his fine dining steak house in the Paris, and loved it.  But never again to the pub",

    "text": "Please save yourselves! I so wanted to like this restaurant. We were there for dinner on a Monday night. Arriving at about 9:15, we only had a 20 minute wait. The decor was really neat, from the lighting to the eating utensils. Even the servers and hostesses uniforms were nicely done. We should've known after waiting 15 minutes before anyone greeted our table that our night was doomed. Of course we were getting anxious and ready to leave but we wanted to try this restaurant so badly and we didn't want to look around for another restaurant and have to possibly wait again. So finally our server arrived. I had seen this server the whole time taking care of the table next to us, so clearly he had seen us as well as another one of his tables that was seated one minute after us. Unfortunately we were not given drink menus when we were seated. The server had it with him on an ipad when he greeted us. This could've taken another five minutes to put our drink order in because he tried to leave it with us and walk away. Fortunately my husband and I immediately spotted a couple of beers on the first paged and ordered before he walked away. When our server returned with our beers five minutes later, he dropped them off and said he'd be right back after he dropped off a menu at another table. Another few minutes later he dropped off some bread and again said he'd be right back to take our order after he dropped off another table's bill. Either this guy had far too many tables to wait on or he was the world's biggest idiot. He was very nice, and tried very hard to crack jokes and make us forget about the past 25 minutes of horrible service. I actually felt really bad for the guy. My husband ordered the lamb burger which was only available on the bar menu but our server made it sound as if he would do us the huge favor and get it for him anyway. Turns out we saw lot's of burgers being delivered to tables. So I wonder why they don't just put the $20 burger on the full dining menu. Anyway, my husband didn't care much for the burger but we both agreed that the fries were outstanding. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and honest to God have never had a worse salad. I think there must have been some sort of mix up or error in the kitchen with my salad because it was so bad. The dressing must've been mayonnaise or something worse. My biggest regret is that I didn't say anything about it to the server. Normally I have no problem with speaking up about bad food but I was mentally exhausted and so completely over this dinner that it was too much effort to say anything. My next regret is that I actually ate it. What is my problem? I ate this disgusting salad and what does that say about me? Gross! I guess I was hungry. Our server obviously felt bad about the service because after we finished eating, he dropped off our check and told us he was deducting $10 from it. We smiled and thanked him. Nope, no deduction, just our full price bill. Again, too irritated and over the whole experience that we just paid and left. On a more positive note, they had a great selection of beer. Overpriced of course, but so is everything in Vegas so we can't fault them for that.",

We were a party of 7 with reservations and we were completely forgotten about..... yes forgotten.... I guess other dinners were more deserving of our food. After 2 hours of being nice and waiting we all snapped and were ready to go. Our imcompentent waiter seemed surprised when we said we were tired of waiting of....REALLY???!!!!! if he had done his job we would have spent a fortune on alcohol while waiting but he didn't do that right either.  The only good thing he did was tell the manager we were leaving who had enough common sense to stop by and did comp what we did get while waiting.  We left and the tip is we should have gone somewhere else. The hubby wanted to stop later in the week for a drink I said NEVER AGAIN for any reason. I would not Wang 7 people to walk out and also being platinum and diamond total reward members.....I have been telling everyone and writing lots about my trip isn't there a saying about telling two people who tell two people and so on.......all I can say is don't waste your time or money.",

We arrived early evening to a fairly empty restaurant, yet the hostess and four waitresses hanging around the front desk were so engrossed in their conversation that we were a bother to them, imagine that!  We should have walked away then! Well, we were seated when one of them decided to do the right thing. We found the decor unimpressive, kind of old style, dark decor....didn't really appreciate it. The waiter came over and recommended a drink which we took his suggestion on. Might have been ok if they had put some alcohol in it, extremely weak, at $15.00 a pop. We each had a plate of 3 tiny sliders, fairly ok. Had to wait 20 minutes for a second drink, what were we thinking?! Bill came to $93.00+ tip. Unimpressive Gordon Ramsay, I think you need to start practicing what you preach, starting in this restaurant.",

The quality of the food is not up to par, but the prices were high.  We sent 2 out of the 5 things back and were still charged for the drink that we did not drink and sent back because it tasted bad.  The Mac and cheese was undercooked and also sent back.  After some argument about whether or not it was undercooked or just \"al dente\" with the waitstaff we felt so awful we wanted to just get out of there.  I know the difference between the two and felt insulted that they argued with me. We left and looked at the bill on our way out-- Unfortunately we were overcharged on our meal as well and had to go back for a $3 refund which was super emabarrasing and I wish we had just left with our dignity at a $3 loss instead.  The manager never came out to apologize for us having such a bad meal or being overcharged.  Even at low end restaurants they would do that.  Very disappointing.  We won't return.",

The pub was a little more than half full and we waited 15 minutes for the server to come over and ask us if we'd like a drink. Another 15 minutes passed and we got our drinks and placed our order. We waited an additional 45 minutes for our food! We watched people come sit down, order, eat and leave while we were still waiting. I asked to speak with the restaurant manager and when I told her we were there an hour and 40 minutes and still waiting for the check she asked if we ordered something that would take a long time?! We ordered a burger medium well and fish and chips! The manager said because I ordered medium well it takes a lot longer, she did not apologize and went to get our check. She brought the check to the table, said sorry guys, turned and walked away! This was the worst service we have ever received. The manager made an excuse for poor service, blamed us for ordering  a medium well burger and did not care to even try and make the situation right. I will never return to any Gordon Ramsey Restaurant or recommend one. This was an extremely disappointing experience.  The food was average at best and over priced. Being in Las Vegas you have many restaurant choices, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one!",

Gordon i Hope you read.this review and get rid of zeus. After waiting over a hour for my main course and not getting the right meal all i need is a simple apology which i didn't get. i got treated like my money was worthless here. this was also the 2nd time i went here since the first night on our trip we had a great time. i look forward to hearing back from you guys",

She asked us for our last name and told us to told us to wait 10 minutes. We stood right in front of her face and she never called our name. When we questioned her she told us she is too busy too look for us and we're suppose to check with her. After I calmed my husband down we ordered our food and to our dismay my simple order of chopped chicken salad dressing on the side was made incorrectly. My husbands Fish and Chips was delicious and I did not get my food until he was done with his. Our waitress never checked back with us in fact she never new that I had to send my salad back. We were very upset and asked for the check. And after waiting 20 minutes I asked to speak to the manager who had me wait another 10 minutes. She apologized and admitted they were not busy for us to have to go through this terrible experience. She offered us a dessert, which I declined. I come from the restaurant world and I never complain about service because I understand that shit happens. But this was the worst service I have ever received and I will tell everyone I know to never go to this restaurant",

Unfortunately our experience was not at all as expected.  It began with a rude waiter.  We were provided with a dinner menu, however we could see clearly others receiving hamburgers, etc.  When I inquired he rudely responded, \"What is the point of your question.\"  It took more than 15 minutes to get our drinks, at which time I had to grab another waitress and ask her to get them.  We did not see our waiter again so we grabbed the same waitress to request an appetizer.  We waited 45 minutes for our food.  The waiter came over one time to assure everything was okay, and then we never saw him again.  We requested that our party have separate tabs and the waiter brought us one check as his gratuity was larger if he combined the bills.  We spoke to the Manager who asked him to do as we asked and he never came back with the separate bills, so we finally paid the one provided as we had to get to a show.  There were 9 of us and none of us will ever return to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.",

    "text": "Let me just start off by saying that I have been to this restaurant quite a few times since it has opened, and never had a bad meal....until now. I was here for my birthday dinner, and was very excited to spend my birthday eating here. The evening got off to a very slow start by the poor service we received from the waiter. It took us about 15-20 minutes to even get the waiter over to the table to get our drink order (which was only an iced tea and a Diet Pepsi).   Once we placed that order, and our food order at the same time, the waiting began. The food actually came out rather quickly...we decided on the fish and chips. Unfortunately, when we received the food, the french fries were damp and soggy, not sure if it was moisture from the fish or what, but we sent the food back because who wants to eat damp, wet french fries? By this point, we still didn't even have our drinks yet.  Finally the second batch of food came out, and although there was less moisture on the fries, they were still damp and not very good. We finally received our drinks, from this point on, we never saw our waiter again. Never came back to check on us, never offered refills, and therefore, we never offered a tip.  I understand that sometimes things happen, like a new cook who can't quite get the food right, being too busy, etc. However, the bad food, coupled with a waiter who didn't seem to care, have left a bad taste in our mouth and we won't be back to this pub. We will just go to Gordon Ramsay Burgr.....hopefully they still know how to make decent burgers and fries there!",

Filling, but for that price you expect to have some leftover to nosh in your room later. Nope. SP is very basic, and nothing special. I ended up wishing I had gotten fish and chips.  We also got an order of warm pretzels for 7 bucks (a happy hour price). Three smallish warmed pretzel sticks with a dip. Should not have cost 3 bucks much less 7 (normally they are higher). Lame.  As we were hydrating after casino cocktail time, we asked for regular water (free). They come pour it for you out of chilled beakers. I was sucking it down, but our waitress was ignoring us (it was not busy at all) and I had to ask busboys for a refill. Twice. At normal cheap diners they ask if you need a refill all the time. Here where you are spending 30-40 bucks on maybe 15 dollars worth of food no hospitality. Lame.  We went at a quiet time, but it was sort of a let down. I don't expect Gordo to come out and ask how the pie is, but I just wish it had been a bit more special.",

First: Irish Pub? their choice of beer there really sucks! I asked about IPA beers and the had only 3! what ALL LAS VEGAS HAS.. Sculpin, Dog Fish and Laguintas. really? thats all? Irish pub? Brown Ales only 2, red ales NONE... the place its decorated with all this beer barrels all around the restaurant.. its just marketing, I can get better beer in a safeway in Fresno CA or at a shitty bar in Oregon..... its a shame that he puts his name but he has gone comercial all the way, money matters, thats it.... The food was \"OK\" I oredered the ribeye and my co-league the NY strip.. I ordered medium and he ordered medium rare... the sent us the food the other way around, mine raw and hes almost all cooked, KUDOS for the service and the waiter on our table, very very polite and wanted to change us the food, we decided not to change it, we were hungry... my ribeye was bland, flat, and no flavor..... the mac and cheese with lobster nothing to talk about, just mac and cheese..... GR you are a star now... making lots of money and I congratulate you for that, thats whats all about, but I feel you sold your self to big corporations.... sad.",

    "text": "Yikes. .. was I disappointed or what. this place was so expensive and so under par that I am amazed it came from the same team that brought me Gordon Ramsey Steak - and \"holier-than-thou-TV Chef-erie\". Common Gordon - whip these underling's butts into shape - please.  We started with the lobster-rolls for 21 bucks - for 2 small ones. And when I say SMALL --- they were essential common dinner rolls with a tablespoon of so-so lobster salad (or should I lobstery say celery salad) on top (not even in it). This would have been one of my grunge snacks in college when I was going to school in Boston, using left-overs from my dad's dinner visit the night before, and some hamburger bun from the pantry. Gordon! GORDON!  The best dish I had was the pea soup with creme fresh - a little watery but tasty. At least tasty in light of things.  My companion and I had hoped that things would go up from here - however - the truffle fries were oily, mushy and Luke warm (obviously left under a heat lamp for too long) ... the fish was over cooked and the breading fell off too easily (obviously under the same heat lamp no doubt). ... and the minted mashed peas were cold (I was really looking forward to these too).  Total bill for all this (a couple of appetizers and one main course to split) was around a hundred bucks.  SAD  Luckily I Bitched loudly - and the very nice manager gave me a discount on the bill, and a free dessert (a really tasty sticky toffee pudding - the best thing that we had here). So come here for dessert and get the pudding: it is served at room temperature and comes out of a big common pan - so no immediate cook-prep required. The theory - like in the army - keep things simple.  When I went to the bathroom (not because of the food) I noticed that there are hundreds of seats here - many of them full - and the food rushes out quickly to them all - so obviously the kitchen prepares their dishes more like TGI Friday's rather than Gordon Ramsay Steak: fast and finished quickly. But at TGI Friday' you get what you pay for.... and at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill: YOU DON'T.",

    "text": "My husband and I are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay. HUGE fans. We are locals and had a night away from the kids. We decided to indulge ourselves by eating at the Pub & Grill.  We ordered the fish and chips and Brussel sprouts. Food was amazing! Came out fast and it was delicious! Best fish and chips in town.  BUT the highlight was our server, Christopher. He tended to everything... anything we needed. Made us laugh until it hurt and gave us a VIP experience. Any friends and family that come into town will be sent to this place. The manager was amazing and made sure we felt at home. He pulled up a chair and we all shared our children's pictures and laughed about being parents... felt right at home! The manager even gave us his card and urged us to send him an email if we sent anyone to the restaurant so he could welcome them with open arms. Wow! Amazing. This doesn't happen often in Vegas.   Vegas is a busy city. Hospitality is usually very good but sometimes feels fake or forced. But Gordon has really made sure his staff is genuine and they truly go above and beyond to make the experience wonderful.   Solid 5 stars, and if you are visiting Vegas please have a meal here, you won't regret it!   Thank you, Gordon. We had such a wonderful time and we will be back!",

    "text": "Mehh, I've definitely experienced better.  This place was a disappointment. However, my friends disagree.  I ordered Beer-Braised Short Rib $38 this lacks flavor. I mean, they added vegetables to add flavor to the short rib but the vegetables didn't have any flavors either. It was missing basic ingredients, like salt and or pepper. Such a disappointment. I expected it to be better. My friends ordered steak, well done. They loved it but then again, they don't dine as much as I do so when I tried their steak... my god, it was not good. When they said well done, it was literally well done that it was tough, dry, and flavorless. I don't understand why they said it was good when it was literally hard to chew. That steak was a fail.  2 good thing about my experience: The skinny fries and the dessert which I forgot the name of it.   Service was mehhh also. We ordered for drinks and it took a while for it to come to our table. Our server was so occupied with the table next to us because maybe they had more demands and there were at least 5 people in their table while there was only 3 of us...   This place was such a disappointment that I will never come again. I love Gordon Ramsay so I will check out other places or restaurants that he owns.",

    "text": "If you're a well known chef, why would you ever put your name on a less than average place? I would have to say that Gordon Ramsay is hyped up way too much. From the outside it looks like a hip restaurant. I would describe it as an upscale pub.  ===Service===  The service here was extremely slow. Our waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order. It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food. I understand the place is pretty busy, but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand.   ===Food===  Complimentary bread and pretzels: The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick, but they were perfectly chewy and soft. They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter. I'd recommend going with the cheese sauce. The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top. Definitely not as good as the pretzels.  Braised beef cheek: Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. This dish was very disappointing. The beef cheek itself didn't taste fresh. Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold. You get that layer of oily white fat. It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all. Also the gravy was pretty bland. Not worth the $28. 2/5  Pan seared diver scallops: Braised artichokes, baby carrots, pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth. They give 4 scallops in this dish. It's not very filling at all since they don't give any type of carb with this dish. It could definitely use some risotto, mashed potatoes, pasta or anything that's a carb! $32. 2.5 stars  Overall, I was sadly disappointed with this Gordon Ramsay location. The service was poor and the food was boring. I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know.",

We ended up spending over 2.5 hours there mostly waiting for check , desert or refills. Our backs didnt enjoy this very much considering we were on oddly proportioned backless stools.The waiter even had the odasity to meantion our group looked \"low energy\". Anyways I guess I just expected more after spending 25$ on a burger. By the end we just couldn't wait to leave. P.S.

As we were so close to the casino floor we were bombarded by not only the sights and sounds of the casino, but the cigarette smoke as well. Then, one of the servers spilled water all over our table and never bothered to wipe it up, leaving our placemats and flatware in a puddle.  And they served our entrees less than 5 minutes after they served our appetizers which was not only unprofessional, but just downright rude.  My Husband's Toad in Hole was tasty, and they cooked his steak rare, just like he requested, but the British Ale and Onion Soup was just so-so, and my Shepherd's Pie lacked seasoning.  Seriously, just a bit of salt and pepper would have been nice.  You'd think lack of seasoning would not be an issue at a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant! The only saving grave was the delicious cocktails and the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  I'd say go for drinks and dessert, skip the dinner, especially for the price!    I've now been to all 3 of Ramsay's Vegas establishments and would recommend Steak and Burgr hands down above this one.  I'm surprised they hail it as Gordon's hang out when he's in Vegas, because we found it.. well.. disappointing.",

    "text": "Mr Ramsay got greedy here... this is supposed to be an in-between for his 3 restaurants in Vegas but it's overpriced and unimpressive. I love BurGR and GR Steak but this place missed the mark for me and I can't say I was surprised based on the reviews. We had a friend that wanted to go though so we gave it a try.   Roast beef sandwich - \"would you like a sandwich with those fries?\" This is what they should ask when you order. The fries were impressive in both portion and taste and totally overshadowed the much less impressive roast beef sandwich. The caramelized onion au jus was awesome but they barely gave me enough for half of my already small sandwich. I ordered mine without the horseradish aioli as I'm not a fan of horseradish and honestly a good roast beef sandwich shouldn't need much else other than the au jus. The meat was good, not great and it was pretty much just lacking all around. At $18 I was quite disappointed. But again... fries... awesome. Had to ask for additional ketchup though as they brought out the smallest little half shot glass of ketchup lol  Warm salty pretzels - 3 pretzel bread sticks for $8... umm... how about some free bread on the table? Isn't this pretty standard when you are paying for a nice meal?  PEI Mussels & Clams - not my choice to order but I'm a fan of clams so I picked at it... and when I say picked at it.. I mean i had to literally pick at the plate to find the tiny bits of clam that had fallen out of all the shells. The chorizo was the best part of this dish and there was about 4 little slices of it.  Chicken Pot Pie - KC ordered this and enjoyed it but it was awfully small for $23. I took a bite and it had good flavor but the one she makes is better.  Our friends ordered steak and caesar salad and seemed to enjoy it but felt like it was overpriced for the place.  Service was so-so... waitress was very friendly but made a few mistakes and forgot some things. She made up for it by comping the pretzels and I don't get too upset with mistakes as long as you are friendly and make an attempt to make up for it.   No ciroc at the bar?! Seriously... I just don't understand that. The place was packed though on a Friday night and I'm sure it will keep doing well with a great location inside Caesars Palace. Crazy tourists....",

The salty pretzel turned out to be three pretzel sticks, clearly pre-made, and not a single piece of salt to be found. The cheese deep looked like it just came out of the microwave and the mustard from the bottle. Not a very good start. The burger did not impress either. The meat, while very juicy, had no flavor, and I mean NONE. The fries are run of the mill.  I have had much, much better food at a local Red Robin, and it didn't cost me $36!!!!!!  If your looking for bland, pre-made and tasteless food and want to blow a ton of cash - then this your place. Otherwise, there are much better options.",

My boyfriend actually had to get up and walk up to the waiter twice to get his attention.",

Nice large salad with lots of meats and other fixins. The \"Apple Cider Vinaigrette\" complemented it perfectly, without being too sweet or too vinegary. It was expensive for a salad, but it's one of the best I've had.",

It was lunch time and not on the menu but MJ made it happen.. it was absolutely  amazing!! The manager Michelle came to our  table and greeted us and also gave us some must haves on the menu. Needless to say we took her advise and it was fantastic. Calamari, pretzel bread, and the sticky toffee pudding.. it was unbelievable!!  Michelle  and MJ definitely  left a good impression. I will make it a point to come back to the pub and grill. Best service by a manager and server I have ever had in vegas.  I'm in vegas at least  6 times a year, so I'll be back very soon. Thank you Michelle  and MJ, you both were amazing!!",

First of all the size and portions were super small. 4 super small pieces for an order that cost $9.  Second disappointment was in terms of flavor, it didn't wow me at all.  At other places I've gone this dish has been a hit and I think the missing ingredient is Goat Cheese.  It's not in it over here.  Hot lollipop wings (3/5 rating) - Northing extraordinary at all.  Just average. Lollipop wings so smaller in size as i expected.  Mini Lobster roll (4/5 rating) - This was my favorite part of my meal and I really enjoyed it. Plenty of Lobster and the quality of the roll was perfect.",

    "text": "I wanted to BE Gordon Ramsey....  The meal we experienced would have invoked rage in the man himself had he been served such mediocre food.   Starting with a Scotch Eggs ($9) - Eggs are plural, meaning more than one. We were served a sole lonely egg - just one. Appearance was nice, but there were more pickled vegetables than Scotch Egg. The egg itself, which is supposed to be soft boiled, was right on the edge of hard boiled. Sausage was bland and crumbly. The hit of the dish was the mustard, yes, the mustard.   Main course: Mini Pie Sampling of All Three Pies ($21) -  The menu was accurate with this description - they are definitely MINI. These \"pies\" are more like pie sliders. Barely a taste of each for what was supposed to be my main meal. The meats and vegetables inside were perfectly cubed, which made it look like those old Swanson turkey pot pies - taste was about the same.  I could not discern a noticeable taste difference between the three, so I can't label a favorite - all were below average.  The pies come complete with a puzzle for your dining entertainment / frustration. Take note of the long wooden basket with the thick wooden dowel running the length over the pies. Trying to eat with a dowel running interference is brilliant if the point is to slow you down. Practical no, frustrating - yes.  Why didn't I simply remove the pies do you ask? The server will warn you that the ramekins are blisteringly hot...  Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ($28) -  My petite wife scored with the largest serving size of the day! There were several nice pieces of fish, which were flaky and cooked perfectly. However, having seen Ramsey's perfect fish & chips on TV, these would also have not made the pass. The batter was not crisp - soft and pliable would be a better description.  The chips - try to find them in the photo... still looking? There are a smidgen tucked under the fish - under the fish, where they can steam and lose ALL crispiness. No crunch in the bunch. As Gordon would say, \"Damn...\" Ah-ha, there was malt vinegar in a little pour bottle on the table, love malt vinegar on fish & chips! Tipped the bottle and a tsunami of vinegar filled the basket, spilled over the edge and all over the table, stopping short of becoming sour perfume all over my wife lest it not for quick reflexes snapping the bottle back to attention.   Desert....not a chance.  Server...very animated and could tell loved his job, but once the food came, was absent until the check appeared. It seems like he was trying to cover one to many tables and a table of two obviously wasn't going to make him as much as the other larger tables that received lots of attention. If he had made the rounds during our meal, we certainly would have made our feelings regarding the food known.  Highlights: Yes, there was one - I had a pint of the Innis & Gunn ($11) - quite pricey, but not available anywhere else in Vegas that I know of, so it was enjoyable.  Overall, to sum up the meal and experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill Las Vegas, no arm flailing or curse words although it may have made me feel better. I am simply at a loss...  I think Gordon himself would sum it up all to well...  \"What a shame\"",

We got sat immediately and customer service was excellent.  The restaurant is unique with very interesting decor. From the table settings to the ambience, I can see chef Ramsay written all over it. We had their lobster rolls for the appetizers and ordered the chicken pot pie and the corned beef and brisket sandwich to share for our entrees. The sandwich was VERY good and flavorful. It is one of those messy eating sandwiches, but totally worth it to try. The chicken pot pie was really good as well, filled with chicken, kale, and other vegetables. the dough was nice and crisp, yet moist on the inside. The lobster roll had a lot of flavor in it as well with good chunks of lobster, but you can't taste the oceany lobster flavor as much because of other flavors. It was still a good try for our appetizers.  Our server checked up on us constantly, and was very friendly yet professional. Overall, our experience was good. If we come back to Caesars again, I would definitely come back to the pub to try more of their other menu items.",

    "text": "Being a Vegas local who is English, I am very sceptical about the Irish and British pubs around town. Many rave that they have the best fish and chips in town or the best curry on their menu and all of them fail miserably at delivering to the high standards they hype the restaurants up to by serving frozen chips. That is, all of them but Gordon Ramsay's Pub.   We started off our late lunch with the Lobster and Shrimp Rolls. Holy cow! These were the dog's bollocks! (For you Americans, that means they were BOMB!) Light and refreshing Maine lobster and shrimp served on a toasted roll. My friend and I both agreed we would be happy with just that every time we came. Then came the Sliders which were perfectly cooked and a decent size.   Here's where we got a little greedy... Well, I got a little greedy. Back home I would always opt for either the fish and chips or the chicken curry and chips. Today, I opted for both... And shared reluctantly with my friend. Bloody hell, GR Pub know how to portion your food to feed you for a week. Let's start with the curry... The Butter Chicken Curry was served with basmati rice and a naan bread. The chicken was so tender it fell apart and melted in your mouth. Chef Otto Spohn came out to check on us and was saying they marinate the breast for a day in the curry base. This set the curry apart from other attempts to serve Indian in a pub in Las Vegas by miles. Normally I would do half and half (chips and rice) with my curry in England so I was looking forward to soaking my chips in the curry sauce.   Now onto the fish and chips. This is where I am most critical. There's nothing like proper fish and chips from the chip shop or pub back home. I never order them in America because I'm always disappointed. Freshly cooked, they came out steaming hot with tartare sauce and mushy peas (a British staple side for fish and chips). The chips were not cut like a typical chip shop chip. They were miles better than the frozen chips or French fries every other venue serves up in America, but they just weren't what I was hoping for. They were bloody good, mind. Just not what I expected from a British guy's pub. The fish on the other hand was PERFECTION! Light, crispy, and huge pieces. I ended up with enough for lunch the next day as well. LOVED the recipe.   We were celebrating my birthday and we were sent out two of the four desserts. The chocolate trifle which I had forgotten how much I loved back home. It was refreshing and delicious. The masterpiece however, was the good old fashioned Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh. My. God. I was in heaven!!!! This was THE best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had... Trust me, I've had a lot of them.   The whole experience from start to end was bloody marvellous. Our waitress, Yanesy was bubbly, funny, and very attentive. I will be requesting her every time I'm back. The decor has a very posh British flair with fancy upholstery and excellent uses of the Union Jack, British landmarks, and of course the signature newspaper print typically associated with fish and chips. I can't wait to go back.",

I asked medium rare which most restaurant mess up (at least in my novice experience), they done it RIGHT! Texture of the lamb patty was very carefully crafted. Condiments, just adds more texture and intensifies favors. Our starter was lolipop wings with bacon blue cheese dipping sauce. I didn't get much bacon flavor. Wing itself wasn't too spicy or too sweet. Very mild yet good kick of spicyness follows.  Again, for wings and burger, it is expensive, but it's the price tag for the experience. It's fun to eat good food watching people blow their money on slots :D i",

My family and I ordered a variety of dishes, including the pub nachos, Chopped salad, scallops, fish &chips, and chicken sandwich and all fell well below expectations for a Ramsay restaurant.  One could easily find a better meal at the local Cheesecake Factory for half the price.  Vegas has a number of outstanding restaurants.  This is not among them. Beware.",

My wife selected the 'Goodbye Blue Sky' drink from the non-alcoholic menu to split with our 5 yr old daughter. My wife happened to smell the alcohol right before trying it. Turns out it is the only drink on the menu to appear in both the non-alcohol and alcohol list, same exact name.  How would my wife know that since she was not looking at the alcohol drink menu? It could have made her very sick. My daughter could have sipped it. There is absolutely no reason for this drink to appear with the exact same name on each list. I do not blame the server but think this is very irresponsible of the restuarant.",

Our server Nicole showed us the menu and made drink recommendations as well as food recommendations.  She then quickly brought us our drinks and took our order.  We went with one of her food recommendations which was the lobster mac.  We also ordered a bacon cheddar burger.  Our food quickly came to our table.  All the while Nicole made sure our drinks were full.  When we finished eating, Nicole casually recommended a delicious toffee bread pudding.  Since we were so happy with her other recommendation we ordered it even though we were stuffed! The dessert was AMAZING!  Actually all the food we ordered was beyond exceptional!!!   I would also like to point out that our server Nicole was wonderful.  We are owners of two tourist based companies in Big Bear Lake, and Nicole is exactly the type of employee we would love to have if we could afford someone like her.  Her take charge attitude and her pleasant demeanor is exactly what most employers dream of!    Great food and Great service!",

The high prices didn't bother us and the food choices were different. I had the lobster mac-n-cheese and my fiance had the shepherd's pie.. well my mac-n-cheese was very mediocre it was a bland gritty cheese sauce (I can make a better sauce at home) and the few pieces of lobster sitting on top tasted like they have been sitting in an ice tub in the fridge. Come on Gordon I know you can do better. Infuse the cheese sauce with lobster or something.. $24 for a cup of cafeteria mac-n-cheese with some defrosted lobster bits on top.. Now for the shepherd's pie. My fiance got violently ill the next day! FOOD POISONING! Never in all the years that we have vacationed anywhere (several times in vegas) has anything like this happened. The day we were suppose to leave to go home and he can't stop.... we'll you know no need to be graphic. He was so bad that we had to stay an extra night in vegas cause he couldn't be in a moving car. An extra night in vegas is not great when you are taking care of a very ill person. Needless to say we will never ever come back to this location and probably never go to another Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Next time we are sticking to Craftsteak (Tom Colicchio's place) now they know how to cook lobster.",

The beer selection is really good but can't say the same for their food. Some of the items that were decent: frisee salad with mushrooms, duck rillettes, mac & cheese. Don't order their sliders, super dry, tasteless and nasty. If Chef Ramsay saw the sliders I got, he would toss it across the kitchen. Their service is pretty good, the server was super friendly. Overall, don't come here unless you want to drink a few beers before a concert.",

A few minutes after we seated, our server came to our table to take the orders, due to my eating style I asked for a dish from sandwich section with no dairy on it. After 20 min the server came back and apologized that they can't make it without dairy; I quickly changed my order to medium cooked grilled lamb burger with lettuce wrap.   As I was chewing slowly, I tried to recall what I had at GR in PH. This burger tasted great and delicious; however lack of amazingness made it less pleasant compared to PH location. I was stuffed but semi-satisfied from the food, service and the dining experience.  Because of more variety and higher prices I was expecting more compared to the other location but it seems more variety makes it less compelling.",

My wife got a berry vodka drink which she said was amazing. For our meals I ordered the Beer Braised Short Rib while my wife opted for a BLT with truffle chips upgrade. We also shared a lobster mac'n'cheese!   The food that came out and looked amazing! My short rib was in a delicious sauce served with root veggies and mashed potatoes. My wife said her BLT was very good. The truffle fries were amazingly delicious! The lobster mac'n'cheese was very good, with a HUGE portion which we ended up taking home.   The restaurant is a bit pricey, but worth it if you're okay with the cost. We will definitely be back.",

I have had waiters who act snarky and entitled to the tip but not Taylor, I gave him as much as I possibly could because he was so awesome and really deserved every dollar I gave him. Definitely request him as a waiter he will make your experience that much better and yes I said experience because eating here is truly an experience like no other. Also I should add.

Our waitress was polite, but constantly bugging us to order. She kept telling us we didn't have to rush, but then she would come back 20 seconds later asking if we were ready yet. I was really annoyed, but it also seemed like the woman was just so high energy that she couldn't stop herself.    We got the nachos as an appetizer, and they were excellent. My daughter ordered a medium-rare burger, and that shit was FUCKING RAW. It was seared on the outside and not cooked at all on the inside. I know a medium-rare burger should be pink, but this was completely raw - like the kind of raw that gets you into a news story about e coli. Why can't this guy teach people to not serve things that are raw?? We did get that item taken off the ticket. I got a reuben, and it was fine, but no better than the ones I get from my local dive bar back home. It was a bit bland, and just way too big. I swear the stack of meat was like five inches high. I took off most of the meat and still could barely finish half of it.   We got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, and that was amazing.",

Set in Caesars Palace, it's a bit of a walk to get here. I recommend you make reservations if you come during a busy time, especially on a weekend. I made a reservation and we were seated immediately. The decor is upscale and has a beautiful bar as well.  I've been here a couple times and have been pleased each time. This last time we started with the kettle chip nachos!! Omg!! They are the best. They make their own chips and it's topped with pieces of juicy tender beef short rib and drizzled with white English cheddar cheese sauce. I could eat a bowl of that alone  We asked our waiter to bring more sauce and she happily brought us more! I then had their signature dish, the Shepherds pie! It's made with lamb and fresh veggies and topped with mashed potatoes. It was so delicious and seasoned perfectly! It is a large portion and very filling. It's the perfect comfort food. One person in our group had the lamb burger. It was juicy and cooked to his liking and  he ate every bite. We all tried the sticky pudding cake for dessert. (One is offered free on Yelp check-in). Winner winner... so good and huge enough to share. I loved everything we tried. Our waitress was amazing and super cheerful as well and made us feel very welcomed.   Some reviews ding this place due to the price. I agree the prices are high..but you expect to pay more when you dine on the Strip and at a top notch casino like Caesars Palace. The food is prepared with skill and passion and worth it. Take the time and check it out. I will be back!!!",

They could have used a touch more salt, but that is my taste.   The split pea soup was nice and creamy.  The disappointment was the Shepard pie.  The potato top was good with a crispy top but the amount of peas and root vegetables was small.  The major fault was that the lamb had been seasoned with spices that hid the lamb flavor. I thought it had an Indian spice overtone which was uncharacteristic to someone who was born in England.  I enjoyed the Innis and Gun ale.  Not too bitter. We skipped dessert as we had already tried the Sticky Toffee at the Steakhouse which was very good there.",

Frozen fries, weird watery meat in Shepard Pie, and a rather bland in eventful burger. It is also expensive.   Just blahhhh.  The whole Gordon Ramsey thing is just an act to sell overpriced food.   The winner of his Chef show that was supposed to be the Chef of the restaurant failed her drug test so she is not there either. So they are just a ship at sea with no sail.   I have spent time in England and this is very much on par with British food. It is pretty bad.",

I really didnt like the couch/coffee table set up because I had to lean over to eat. Then, interestingly, I give the waiter a $50 bill when I hand him the black folder (that contains my credit card ) with the check and he takes the cash and puts it in his pocket, and brings me the the bill with the full amount on the card. I reminded him I gave him a fifty with the bill (to apply cash first, rest on the card), he thought that was his tip? He did go back and fix it.",

More fattiness coming from avocadoes and mayo dressing with nothing in the burger to cut through the fattiness. There simply wasn't a balance of flavors. When you are charging 20 bucks for a burger at least serve it with a house salad with some vinigratte. I couldn't finish the burger because it was simply too heavy when the portion was kind of small to begin with. The poutine was good. But the server didn't get our order right and forgot my friend's order which cost another 30 minutes of waiting time. And we were seated at the entrance besides the revolving door where ambience was non existant. It's difficult to understand the purpose of placing a table that is practiacally outside of the restaurant. When asked for a re-arragement, the only option was to wait for another 30 minutes because better seats were offered to those who were behind the line wearing dresses... All in all, this was not a dining experience that one expects at a Gorden Ramsay franchise.",

For main course we tried the shepherds pie, sliders and fish and chips. It didn't get better, the pie was drenched in oil and the sliders were dry. Fish and chips were good great fries.

She suggested Fish & Chips as well as Short Ribs. Each dinner was over $ 30 which I don't mind as long as the quality, taste & portion match the price. After waiting an unusually long time for our dinner, we received small portions of fish & short ribs. The majority of my tasteless short ribs was a huge helping of barley, also tasteless. The fish was prepared well & tasted good, however, the portion did not reflect the price. The chips were unremarkable French fries. Drinks are overpriced also since they are served in small glasses. Worst part was the service. No excuse for the lack of attention since there were many open tables, we did notice the staff enjoyed congregating & enjoying one another's company much to the customers detriment.

    "text": "Worst Dining Experience in a Very Long Time!!  We have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Pub on previous occasions and while not outstanding, we have never had the abysmal service that we experienced on Thursday 3/26. I booked a month in advance for a party of 6, expecting a dining table or booth. Instead we were shown to a high top bar table with stools in a crowded, extremely (shouting to each other to talk) bar. Nothing else available we were told. Server took ten minutes to acknowledge us. Drinks were offered. Another ten minutes passed before we were able to order. While the appetizer of mildly hot and sweet wings was good, the rest of the meal went downhill. Two diners ordered Shepard's Pie, mediocre reviews. Lobster Mac & Cheese first course was over price at approx $22 ($24?) dollars and missing lobster. Two diners ordered the organic chicken dish. When dinner was served, after an almost 40 minute wait, the Organic chicken turned out to be Bangers and Mash. When this was called to our servers attention, he said (and I quote), \"Oh, the button for the Organic Chicken is beside the Bangers and Mash, I must have pushed the wrong button.\" When we advised just to take the plates and we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for our entree he offered to bring us a Shepards Pie (which they must have made ahead and keep ready under warmers?) Since neither of us eat red meat this was not an option. Our table asked for salt and pepper four times before it was brought, after dinner was essentially over. Our consolation for no dinner? Our server grudgingly offered dessert \"on him\". Incidentally, while no one could remember to bring condiments, they did manage to return to the table four times to refill drink orders from the bar, thus goosing up the check to the best of their ability. Terrible, terrible service and Chef should be appalled. No manager approached or offered apologies. I left a 10% tip, my husband, who is usually overgenerous with tips, wanted to leave nothing. We will not return to Gordon Ramsay' Pub.",

I wish he had stuck to True pub food because he missed the mark on being something more. When you order pub fries, you expect fries. Instead we got potato blocks. The steak was just ok and that should be fairly easy to get right.  It's ironic that he has a tv show about bad restaurants, because his is not what I would call good. Even if the meal hadn't cost $500, it still wouldn't have been good.   Don't waste your time, your money, or your calories.",

    "text": "Having stayed at The London in NYC and dined both at Gordon Ramsay--which was excellent and at Maize--which was also very good, I was very disappointed with the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill. From the start, the girl acting as Maitre D could not find the reservation that I had made with her personally the day before. There were a group of female employees--hostesses--I think who spent more time chatting g with each other than assisting guests. Very tasteless.    The food was mediocre at best. The Caesar salad was atrocious. My colleague had the flat iron steak which was tough, fatty and \"the worst steak he's ever had\". I had the shepards pie, which Mr Ramsay has featured on many a special. It was good, but the presentation was mediocre...a crock of Shepard's pie that looks like someone took a crap in a bowel and served it. I had a side salad of weeds, with a tasteless vinaigrette and a few slices of apple. Hardly appealing. I would rate this dining experience 1.5 out of 5 at best. Chef, I am truly disappointed. Perhaps your Hell's Kitchen winner will liven up a rather lousy dining experience.",

The four of us got there and we started with some nice drafts, they got a big selection like 24 I think the server said. The server forgot his name was friendly and knew his stuff recommended a calamari, different from what I am used to but this was good. For entree I had a fish n chips one of the best that I ever had, my wife had the lamb burger and she thought it was good. Our friends had a filet and salmon, John though his filet was a little under cooked but ate it all. For desserts we had this sticky toffee pudding all I can say it was the best thing of the night. You have to try this dessert if you go here.",

Being warmly greeted and seated quickly established my positive impression and the staff maintained the momentum. Our server, Joshua, arrived promptly and took exceptional care of us.   We started off with Spiced Cider and Sloe Bramble cocktails. The sweet cinnamon flavor of the cider hit the spot. I cannot recommend it enough! The Sloe Bramble was \"berry\" nice but lacking in the wow factor. I enjoyed rifling through the online bar menu on Joshua's tablet.   The Rib & Cheek Sandwich is beyond tender. It was flavorful and rich. The potatoes were huge and nicely seasoned on the outside with Parmesan cheese.   The Mac N Cheese is divine. I adore the truffle and tiny duck fat crouton topping. Just a luscious dish.   For dessert a must is the Sticky Toffee Pudding! Forgo the Chocolate Trifle and order two of the puddings! Don't worry about the servings being too big. They are just right.   Thank you Joshua for being so knowledgeable, quick to gauge customer tastes and just charming in general. The staff was sweet and pleasant all around. I am happy to endorse this establishment and will certainly stop by again.",

We made reservations for 7:30pm, arrived 20 minutes early so were shown to the bar. After waiting until 8:00 pm, and having to check with the hostess, we were finally seated at an empty table that we noticed was empty the whole time we were standing bar dodging the waiters/waitresses coming through with trays of drinks.   As soon as we sat down, a waiter tried to deliver a yummy looking dessert, but we hadn't even ordered yet!  Three of us ordered the fish and chips and the other ordered mixed grill. After about 45 minutes, two fish and chips and the mixed grill were served. We all sat there for another 15 minutes for the last poor guy to be served.  By the time all the food was served, everything was barely warm. The fish was only so-so, \"the chips\" (big fat fries) were very good, but not chips! The peas were good. On the mixed grill, the shrimp was tough, and the pork belly was fried so long it was hard.  I think this restaurant is overpriced, but great service and great food are worth it. Unfortunately, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill had neither.",

Stumbled on Gordon Ramsays location here at Cesears one hungry afternoon. Seated right away and ordered two beers. Drinks served promptly by our server who was very professional the entire way through our meal.   We shared the sliders, mac and cheese and mixed veges (brussel sprouts and carrots). Sliders were great- cooked medium with cheese and bacon. Very tasty. Mac and cheese was excellent with several cheeses and duck fat croutons. The veges, believe it or not were outstanding. Mini brussels and carrots sauteed and seasoned perfectly.   Service was quick and professional. Prices were high but on par with what you got and Vegas in general. No complaints here! Will definitely return.",

We were able to catch another waitress that was serving the table next to us to grab us more water and steak sauce, and she wasn't very pleasant. Our bill came out to $225. No gratuity.

That said, this visit I sat at the bar and enjoyed Ray Ray the bartender's regular, but not obtrusive check ins. He personally checked the kitchen when the man's burger next to me was delayed. And by delayed, I mean free extra wine bc it was a long time and the kitchen refused to serve less than well-executed food.  I again, ordered the fish and chips. It's a pub and I wanted pub food. The fish was tasty, crunchy, slightly salty (in a good way), hot, flaky, moist, and HUGE. Plus, it was light and not greasy, beckoning additional bite after bite. and when my paced slowed, a little tangy, salty, texture-pleasing tartar sauce propelled me to finish every last bite.  So what no bread service at lunch. Not a deal breaker here and Ray did ask if we wanted dinner menus.  The chips were thicker, square fries, with crispy edges and hot, soft potato inside. The Parmesan and seasoning blend were delights and almost rendered the ketchup unnecessary. My husband finished his and started helping me on my portion.  My last time here I wondered why oh why, mushy peas? Now, these peas still retain enough texture to have some bite. They taste fresh. The savory, almost umami-like taste kept me going back bite after bite.  His pork belly sandwich delighted the palate with a nice blend of bitter, soft, crunchy, wet, sweet, and heat. He did request extra horseradish sauce but only offered me a single bite bc it was that good. He says he would order it again, and add a crispy or cheesy element. Still a hit in our books!  Best part, Ray-Ray excellences advised in a more-British tasting beer, and delivered my husband a Guinness and Dunn from Scotland. It perfectly complemented his sandwich.  We will return! Till then Yelpers, try to read a few of the 500+ reviews to order wisely and granted, the service sometimes ha hang ups but I'm always, always a pleased customer!",

We had lamb burger, beef burger, wedge salad and lobster roll. Food is spectacular. The serves at this restaurant is superb. It's always great to go to a restaurant with pleasant waitresses.

We had the best service ever from Travis he made sure we had everything we needed and kept checking up on us and suggested we have the toffee bread pudding desert which just melted in your mouth with warm caramel drizzle on top of vanilla ice cream!! We left so stuffed but well worth it and we will return and recommend to everyone I know.",

This is a situation where these restaurants can get away with charging whatever they want for normal-quality food just because the people who eat there are splurging in Vegas. The staff here isn't great either and the front of the restaurant is open to the casino floor so you get to watch people playing slots while you eat. $100 should buy a little more ambiance than that.",

    "text": "I am a Las Vegas \"local\" - I'm constantly in the area due to family business, but I rarely have time to visit the strip. This was my first time in a Ramsay restaurant and I was absolutely blown away. The decor is amazing, and the service and food is even better.   I ordered a goodbye blue sky cocktail, which was delicious. My friend and I also ordered flat iron steaks ($39) and a side of truffle chips (i don't recall price). I've had my fair share of steaks, but this was absolutely amazing. So flavorful and the pub steak sauce made it even better.  Truffle fries were delicious as well!  I would like to give a special shoutout to our server that night, Sladjan. I noticed that a number of customers were really giving him a hard time. My friend used to be a server and even said some patrons were a bit much. Because of how busy he was, we got our drinks a bit later. However, sladjan was very professional and apologized to us promptly once he realized this. He came back to our table numerous times to make sure we were happy and doing well, and even shared some stories and jokes with us. I've never had such a pleasant experience with a server before. I'm sure he was very tired, but he never let that show. He was always smiling and very professional. When i return i will be sure to ask for him if he's working. His service was impeccable and because of him, my experience was even better than what it was before. He even took our picture with the ramsay picture, then joined us for one picture afterwards!  I'll definitely be back - great food, better service - if you haven't been here before, you should check it out. It is one of the more affordable ramsay options, but that doesn't mean it isn't as amazing as his other restaurants on the strip.",

Co workers had to come in and verify it was for any 3 pub items.  Bartender then gets an attitude and says \"well now we got to go tell the kitchen to cancel the extra mini Mac orders\" very rudely and then left me hanging almost 20 minuets before taking care of my order and having the manager come out to fix the transaction. He never even apologized. Please learn your menu items and how to bill costumers correctly and offer more professional customer service! Terrible experience.  To top that off we stood on the other end of the bar and couldn't get any type of help all bartenders were free and ignored we were there trying to order.

The beer menu is excellent with a ton of craft and small breweries available. The decor is a bit odd with a hit you over the head amount of British decor and kegs everywhere. Yes, we get it, it's a British pub. The food is excellent though, particularly the burgers. The Hell's Kitchen burger is fiery hot with some ghost pepper but not so much that it overwhelms the palate. The meat is well cooked and seasoned too and didn't get lost in the heat.

For 9 bucks (happy hour) you would think a place like this would offer another beverage.  To expensive place even at happy hour to not have GREAT service.  Lots of other options.

    "text": "Dining here felt like we were on an episode of Hell's Kitchen! Both blue and red teams have failed miserably! I was waiting to hear yelling and screaming from Chef Ramsay from the kitchen.  My cousin wanted to dine here before we proceeded with his bachelor party evening. We didn't make reservations here, so we ended up with a wait of forty five minute to an hour. When the estimated seating time came, we were seated promptly. While browsing our menus, our drink orders were taken and water glasses filled. I was very anxious and excited to try Chef Ramsay's favorite dish, beef wellington. Apparently, it wasn't on the menu. So, I ended up getting the roast prime rib entree, medium rare.  After twenty minutes had passed, we were told our entrees would be out in five minutes. Then ten, fifteen, and thirty came and went. Still, no signs of our entrees. Yet, other customers who were seated after us had their entrees served. We were all ready to get up and leave and dine else where. But, we all just decided to stick it through. Once our entrees were being served, they were served in waves. I was the last one in our party of seven to receive my entree.  For a $40 entree, I'll admit the entree looked hearty. The prime rib was cooked to a medium rare and accompanied with some glazed baby carrots, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. I had a side of creamy horseradish sauce, but no au jus for dipping. I would say that the prime rib was comparable to other dining establishments in Vegas. I would've been better off with the $10 prime rib dinners and paid way less than $40. But, I guess it was for the name and experience, right?  At the conclusion of our meal, my cousin went to place a complaint regarding our dinner service. The server and hostess were great, but not sure what was going on in the kitchen. I really wanted to like this place, but I wasn't impressed at all.",

Have to say they offer to replace it but I had to try, they serve it with very nice but very not fresh pretzel, I stopped eating. They say they will tell the manager, I guess it wasn't important enough or he was busy because we just got the bill with no charge of the pie.

First off, the five star rating should mainly just go to our bartender, Ray Ray. He's the type of guy you should blindly trust when it comes to your beverage and is an amazing person to get to know.   The food is just what you'd expect out of a Ramsay kitchen. We've tried things we liked and things we didn't think we'd like and ended up falling in love with.   My recommendations: Warm Salty Pretzels.  If you love mustard, the English Granary Mustard tops it.  Herb Caesar.  8oz Beef Tenderloin.  Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips.  Pistachio Pesto Chicken Sandwich (I have a sick obsession with pesto and this makes the top of the list). STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING.   Cocktails: Salted Caramel Apple.   Beer: Innis & Gunn.",

The menu looked amazing, but we had just come from lunch at Gordon's burger restaurant so we stuck to drinks. We topped off the experience by meeting chef Scott!  He was so nice and talked about show and took photos with us. For a Hells Kitchen fan this was an amazing birthday gift.   Thanks to the amazing staff for making us feel so special!",

Definitely great ambiance.  We started with an appetizer of Calamari, and the dish was executed perfectly - great flavor, crispy but light calamari, elegant presentation.  For the entree, I was between Bangers and Mash and Beef Short Rib, and unfortunately, listened to our waitress' advice to take the short rib. The rib was cooked well enough, but had no flavor and lots of fat. Short rib is one of my favorite dishes, and I had much better versions at other places on multiple occasions. It was also served with some bland Barley Risotto which additionally dulled down the dish which was not great to begin with. We got Sticky Toffee Pudding for the dessert, and it was one of the highlights of the meal.  Service was friendly and attentive.   Recommended, but mostly for the ambiance.",

I took a seat at the bar and was quickly served by one of the bartenders. The menu contains a lot of classic British pub dishes, so I decided to go with the Fish and Chips. I'm typically not a fan of mushy peas as you usually get so much in the UK, but the bartender assured me they would be on the side.  The food came rather quickly and was an average portion size - 2 pieces of fish and some fresh cut potato wedges as fries. Mushy peas were like a condiment- the same serving size as the tartar sauce and ketchup.  The fish was good - crispy batter and tender fish, but nothing more special than a good corner fish and chip shop could do at a much lower price.",

We ordered from the prix fixe menu which included Roasted Tomato Soup, Shepherds Pie and Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. Everything was SO GOOD! The Roasted Tomato Soup was what every tomato soup should taste like, creamy, tangy, warm, delicious. The shepherds pie was everything you want (especially if you are slightly hungover, which I was) creamy cheddar potatoes with a slightly crispy crust and a rich lamb stew, lamb was especially tender. Even better than all of that was the Sticky Toffee Pudding! I had a sliver of it at Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris (literally all you get is a sliver of the same deliciousness). I expected just a sliver here but was delightfully surprised to get a huge serving, I thought I was full but sinfully ate the entire thing! The ice cream and some of the pudding is a perfect bite every time!",

Our server Adam was funny, engaging, knowledgeable, and readily available.   The food was very good and I honestly felt that while the prices tended to be on the higher side, it wasn't outrageous. My wife and I left feeling like the quality of the food we received accurately reflected the cost of each item. Simply put, it was worth it.   We started with the nachos which were incredible along with the lobster rolls. Now, we're from north of Boston and have a pretty high standard for a lobster roll. I can say that while this wasn't the best roll we've ever had, it was pretty fantastic for being in Vegas. Best one that I've had outside of New England for sure.   Our mains were the fish and chips and the curry chicken. Both excellent. Both larger portions than we could finish. We did our best to save room for dessert so we could have the toffee pudding. Again, excellent.  We loved out experience from start to finish. The food was as good (maybe better) than what we had at Gordon Ramsay Steak the following night and for much less.  Can't wait to go back.",

Just the right amount of peppers to make the whole dish really flavorful.  Creamed spinach: really good! Eat this first before it gets cold!  Lobster Rolls: I didn't try these but my friends enjoyed them!  Chopped Salad: really good, light, healthy...a great compliment to the entrees we chose!  English Cheddar Beef Burger + bacon: BEST DAMN BUGER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! Wow! Dreaming about this burger! You see Gordon bust out an amazing burger on TV but this is ridiculous! The truffle fries with garlic aioli were to die for as well!   Great drink menu that offers a great wine list, variety of beer and some mocktails so there is something for everyone here!   To top it off our waiter Julio made our experience amazing!  He was super helpful suggesting menu items, checked on us frequently, and was very personable. He brought us a warm sticky toffee dessert for my birthday with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream...we didn't leave any behind! We literally canceled our dinner plans at another restaurant because we were soo full!  I would fly into Vegas just for this burger if I could! This will definitely be my 1st stop on my next trip!  Cheers to Julio! Ask for his section if you visit!! Gordon...this guy should be training servers! He's awesome!",

Every plate brought to the table was delicious! My parents don't usually rave about food but this place was the exception. They loved everything about it! Not to mention, my sister and I, actually saw Gordon at the tables in Caesars earlier doing some filming! We went to the restaurant later in the day and heard he was actually eating in the back dining room!  Such a great trip and experience at this restaurant and I loved the vibe at this place! Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I love deviled eggs.  They are one of my favorite things to eat, so I came out of my way to specifically go here, and unfortunately I was underwhelmed.  I was choosing between this and Bacchanal.  I wish that I'd have tried Bacchanal instead.  However, I also wanted to get some drinks and other things at a few other places, so I thought I'd be too full if I ate the buffet.  Anyway, I came here.  The layout of Caesar's is kind of strange, and the signs weren't helpful, so I walked for a long time, and just kind of ran into it.  If you're staying here, it would probably be easier for you.  I went at lunch, and it was not busy, and I decided to sit at the bar.  The bartenders were very nice, and one of them asked to help me right away.  They got me a menu and water.  I ordered the deviled eggs and a Goodbye Blue Sky drink.  The menu said the eggs have crab, so I ordered them without crab (I'm vegetarian).  The bartender then told me that they have crab mixed in them, so you can't get it without it.  I was really disappointed since I came here specifically for them.  However, then a waiter came by and he heard us, and said the deviled eggs don't have crab on them now.  He knew the menu still said it, but they don't actually serve them with it anymore.  I really don't watch any of the reality shows with him, but wouldn't Gordon Ramsey flip out if a restaurant's menu was wrong!?!  In any case, it worked out for me because I got my deviled eggs.  They were ready really fast, which was nice.  They weren't anything special though.  They were kinda pretty, but nothing too fancy.  I was really disappointed that I came out of my way for them.  They were fine, but I've had better ones at restaurants at home.  The drink was also just ok.  People seem to love it in the reviews, but it pretty much tasted like juice to me, and it was expensive.  Overall, I really wish I had gone to Bacchanal instead.  Or, I wish I'd gone back to Yardbird at the Venetian again.  Their deviled eggs are awesome!!  This place was nothing special.  I'd skip it.",

    "text": "So, being a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and his plethora of shows, You Tube channels and various cookbooks, my wife and I decided we needed to try his restaurants with each visit to Vegas. This most recent trip, we decided to try his Pub and Grill at Caesar's. What can I say? The man knows how to give you the dining experience you expect and more.   Atmosphere:  We reserved a spot on their website and arrived at the restaurant. It was a Thursday evening and the place was moderately busy. We waited about 5 minutes and then were seated promptly. Walking through the restaurant, you really felt like you were in a traditional English pub,but with a modern twist. There were barrels on the walls, cool looking mini chandelier lights hanging from the ceiling, flat screen TV's and tables with the half- rising comfortable booths.   Food:  The menu featured many traditional pub foods, which all sounded delicious. I had the scotch egg starter. Prior to this I hadn't ever tried it, but it was amazing! The inside egg was cooked nicely and just slightly runny, the crust on the outside was very crispy and the sauce complimented it perfectly; I could have eaten a small cup of it all by itself!   We ordered our main courses: I had the steak and ale pie and my wife had the shepherds pie. Both were traditional pub dishes and both were amazing. The steak pie had beef and veggies, both of which were very tender and delicious, surrounded by a crust that was extremely light, flakey and delicious. The shepherds pie was also very delicious. The lamb was very tender, the potatoes on top were so creamy, yet not very heavy tasting like you get with most mashed potatoes. Overall, great dishes!   I tried the sticky toffy pudding after hearing so many great things about it. It was a party in my mouth! So many delicious flavors between the ice cream, toffy and caramel. It was truly one of the best desserts I have eaten.   Service: Our server was amazing! From the time we sat down to the time we left, she was extremely laid back, friendly and very attentive to any needs we had. She gave us plenty of time to review the menu, order and brought out our food quickly. She was always on top of refills for water or other drinks we had. It was a very comfortable service experience.  Overall:  We were thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere, service and food of Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill and I am not just saying this because I am a fan of GR. We went in putting our fan bias to the side wanting to truly experience all this restaurant had to offer. It definitely did not disappoint. If you are looking for a very authentic English  pub experience with a modern twist this is the place to go to in Las Vegas. For a lunch or dinner out or just for some beers and appetizers, this place has you covered. We'll definitely be back!",

For my meal I had the signature Beef Wellington (although I've dined at other Gordon Ramsay restaurants I had yet to try it) and it did not disappoint.  It was tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection in a buttery flaky crust.     Wow!  Will definitely get it again.  I had a Caesars Diamond Celebration Dinner $100 certificate to use (and it had to be used all in one shot or you lose what you don't use) so I got the BLT and Caesar Salad with chicken to go.  They were both outstanding when I ate them later on (I purposely got things I knew would be good cold).    For checking in on Yelp I got a free Sticky Toffee Pudding (Ramsay's signature dessert) and lets just say it is a decadent slice of heaven on a plate.  I've had it before, so I knew what to expect.  It's worth coming here just for that!   I had a great experience and highly recommend Gordon Ramsay Pub at Caesars Las Vegas.",

    "text": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!  My experience here was so positive I came back to eat again the next night. I knew the food would be delicious again and the service was great. The first night I had the tenderloin and the apple tart. I also used the check-in offer for their signature dessert.    The tenderloin was honestly one of the best I've ever had! The temperature (medium for me) was perfect but the smoky oak flavor and slightly crispy crust put it over the edge for me. Absolutely delicious and perfect!  The Apple Tart was amazing and the salted caramel ice cream balanced the flavors wonderfully.   Service from Ronni and Nong was TOP NOTCH!    I returned the next evening with my wife and they made it special once again!  This time my wife had the tenderloin (she described it as the best she's ever had) and we had the wings as well and they were absolutely DELICIOUS!  The balance of savory and sweet with a slight bit of heat. The meat of the wings was mostly tender but slightly crispy, too - great balance once again.   Our whole experience was excellent and we can 100% recommend it. We will return soon for sure  Update:   We just went there again!    I took buddies there & they said it was the best (Prime Rib & Beef Wellington)  they'd ever had. We had appetizers, drinks & dinner and all left glowing.   I went again with my wife 2 nights later & sat at the bar. Nong and Johnathan treated us like VIP guests again and made sure everything was special.  We had drinks, dinner and dessert - savoring every bit of it.   We won't forget going here and will return every time we're able.   Well done, Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill!  Every time we go you consistently impress us!",

Needless to say, the level of service at any restaurant, in and by itself are the game changers for me...and our hostess (Heather) was hands down an A+++.

Food: (first) Braised Short Ribs, (second) Fish and Chips, (third) Pigs in a Blanket, (fourth) Sticky Toffee Pudding  Price: $39, $30, $14, $12  Ratings:  I loved the tenderness of the braised beef. Super tender and not that salty. My mom ordered their Certified Black Angus Tenderloin (8 ounce-$43). It was a perfectly cooked medium steak! Super juicy and very tender.  I also enjoyed the pigs in a blanket, which had three mini hot dogs. We ordered this for our appetizers, which was really good to share amongst 2-3 people. The sausage was very crisp on the outside and warm and tender on the inside.   I also tried their fish and chips! It wasn't too bad, but for the price, I did wish that they gave more of the fish in relations to the ratio of the French Fries.   I definitely recommend trying their sticky toffee pudding! However, be warned! It is a little sweet as the server pours it for you to create that sticky toffee pudding. Nonetheless, it was still very creamy and yummy.   Service was pretty good. You can make reservations! We walked from Palazzo to Caesars Palace (~10 mins!)",

Ryan, age 13 is a real fan of GR so he was very excited and had high expectations.  We were served by Lisa and Alex. They were both attentive, professional, pleasant, and added positively to the whole experience.  We started with the nachos and lobster mac. Gobbled both up and licked the plates!  We each ordered an entree: Wings, Pesto Chicken, Reuben, Fish &Chips, Bacon Burger and Lobster Roll. WOW! All delicious! Then we met the manager, Derek. Class act, all the way. He brought Ryan some GR swag which was totally unexpected. While we were waiting for the bill, Lisa and Alex appeared with two Sticky Toffee Pudding deserts for Ry and told us they were from Gordon. We were floored!  Desert was over the top good and we were left with full bellies and great memories.  This was my wife's and my 4th time here. Each has been great but this one topped them all!  Thank you so much to Lisa, Alex and Derek!",

    "text": "So I feel like maybe I'm being a little too critical with my 4 Star rating, but I have pretty high standards for any Ramsay establishment.   Food and drinks were all good, some were great. Service was attentive but not necessarily personable or warm. Accommodations were comfortable and unique, like an upscale sports lounge.   I can't remember the exact name of my cocktail, but it was the one with \"blue\" in the name; it was incredible. However, my boyfriend ordered a Moscow mule and it was oddly not served in the traditional copper cup, but a highball glass instead and I think it affected the drink.   We had the poutine starter and the flavors were great! Fries cooked to perfection, appropriate amount of gravy, and flavorful corned beef for a Ramsay twist. However, I felt the cheese curd component was a little skimpy on the portion as they were only on the top and had been put under a salamander/broiler style equipment, so they were slightly tough, chewy and did not unify the dish like gooey and melted cheese  in traditional poutine.  I had the side order of lobster macaroni and cheese for my entree and still had leftovers, it's huge. And amazing. Tons of lobster chunks and a flavorful cheese sauce. Taylor had a bacon cheese burger, also huge. And more perfect fries. But he couldn't stop raving about the aioli it came with and dipped his fries in it all night, which is a big deal because he doesn't think he likes \"mayonnaise\".   Our service experience was not lacking, but it also wasn't memorable or anything beyond what you would expect from a full service restaurant.   The restaurant sits next to the casino floor but the main dining room feels separate enough and the smoke is not intrusive. Entering Caesars on the south side bridge (connecting from Bellagio) you would cross the casino floor, towards Apian Way- a marble row of shops. Go straight across the walkway and it will pop out on another area of the casino floor; the restaurant is to the left on the left. You will notice a bunch of beer kegs and masculine colors- that's it!",

Maybe I am just being critical since it's Ramsay's restaurant, but trust me, I wanted to give it a better rating if I could.

So the overpriced food better be good.  That will be the only way this is a 1 star.   Well....medium well burger was medium rare. Fish. One filet was overcooked and one was mushy.  So food was a 1 Star also.",

We sat at the bar and admired the wall made of barrels that were part of the decor. Matt, our bartender, was an awesome guy who mastered the art of balancing several patrons. We never felt ignored or smothered. I got the smoke and mirrors, which I really like because it was the perfect combination of sweet and strong liquor. I also got the goodbye blue sky and it tastes exactly like the purple skittle. It was good but too sweet for me.   If you check in, you also get a free sticky toffee pudding! So we got that and an order of the truffle fries. Matt aptly named them \"death by truffle\" because there's truffle oil as well as bits on the top of the fries. They were deliciously crispy which I loved. One of our nearby patrons got the nachos and said those were worth it too!   All in all, if you want a place to duck away from the fast pace of the Strip but not leave the Strip, I'd recommend this place.",

He is so friendly, attentive, and interpersonal! Rodney was like an old friend treating me to his restaurant. He kept checking on me and suggesting if I needed anything to make my experience here better! Gordon Ramsay, please give Rodney the best recognition for extending and expanding the wonderful experience of your Pub and Grill! Additionally, I would like to provide my experience of the food. We did the 3 course meal of the diver scallops, beef Wellington, and the sticky toffee! The scallops were by far my favorite-- absolutely delicate and delectable! I'm not one for medium rare meat but after the Wellington, I'm a huge fan! The Sticky Toffee was absolutely delicious, flavor town indeed! Perfect experience! Thank you to the food and thank you to Rodney!",

My husband told him the type of beer he liked and Rodney matched it perfectly with his recommendation. I ordered the union jack IPA and it was good. We started off with the white cheddar and garlic mini mac. The portions are good size and the flavor was an explosion in my mouth. Garlic is my new go to to add in mac! We split the beef Wellington, a must if you eat at one of his restaurants that offer it. Splitting it was a good choice and it was very filling. The mashed potatoes it came with was perfection. The asparagus, I could eat a whole plate of it alone. The beef Wellington was cooked to a MR and it was absolutely delightful! We ended with the sticky toffee pudding (made with sweet dates) and it was the perfect sweet ending to a delicious filling meal!",

The ribeye was the worst cut of meat I've ever had and it had zero flavor/seasoning. The creamed spinach had an inch-thick layer of loose panko crumbs on top that I had to scrape off in order for it to be edible. I mentioned to the waiter that my steak tasted \"like nothing\" and he offered to swap out my ribeye for an alternate protein. I was given the prime rib, after a 20 minute wait, which was also flavorless. When the bill arrived, they charged me for the prime rib which was more expensive. My husband ordered a NY strip steak which wasn't half bad. Overall, we spent $200 and I ate maybe 5 bites of my meal.",

We stopped by for happy hour and started with the servers nacho recommendation.  Think midrange pub nachos with kettle chips, but kick it up a notch. The chips were flawless, cheese of good quality, meat not overcooked, and less greasy than expected.   For drink, I tried the Moscow mule. It tasted great, but I really wanted it to come in a copper mug instead of glass.   For main course, I tried the fish n chips. It came with two pieces of fish, wedge cut fries, and some mushy peas. For the price, I was hoping for a three piece, but the fish was well seasoned, tender, and flakey. Definitely some of the best fish n chips I've had.   The fries were a big let down. I prefer mine crispy, while these were more on the soggy side. The mushy peas were made well, but weren't appealing to my palette.   My partner ordered the maple fried chicken sandwich. It was huge, tasty, a slight bit dry, but did not disappoint.   We wanted dessert, but were stuffed and already in a serious food coma.   Despite mediocre fries, I still think this restaurant is worth a 5 star rating when compared to other restaurants in its category.",

The first time I was here I had the Bangers and Mash, and my tummy was in heaven! Great texture and flavor in the sausage, yum. On this most recent trip, I had the mini cheeseburger appetizer as I wasn't super hungry, and it was perfect. So often, sliders are dry and puckish, but these were incredible! Perfectly grilled to a nice juicy medium, the generously sized  and delicious patty filled the tender brioche bun and was smothered in cheese and a crisscross of bacon! Yum! They also do a great job with their cocktails. My friend is picky about her greyhound, she likes just a splash of grapefruit juice, and the bar got it right every time. Our server, Afro, was beyond excellent! He made good suggestions, knowing we weren't starving, and was a delight. I would request his table again for sure!

I went thinking I'd get the fish and chips but we decided to split a Beef Wellington. It had always been my dream to try it since I've watched every season of MasterChef. The server Rodney suggested we share an appetizer and then the Wellington and that was the perfect amount of food. We had the braised beef kettle chip nachos and they were good. They were definitely the fanciest nachos I've ever had. Then came the Wellington. Oh goodness it was a EVERYTHING! I have never had beef that cut like butter. The potatoes were potatoes, velvety smooth but could have used a smidge more butter but that could just be me since I live buttery potatoes. It was such a rich flavorful pricey plate, but it was worth the splurge. The awesome thing was that they offered a free sticky toffee pudding if you checked in on yelp and it was AMAZING! The combination of caramel and ice cream and cake was so perfect. It's one of my favorite desserts now. It could have been really sweet given its components but it was so wonderfully balanced. I'm sure we'll be going back whenever we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "The Pub is next to the casino and has an open bar area, but there is also a dining room that is protected from the hoi polloi (and the smoke) and makes you feel like you are in a pub in England (except for the waiters lederhosen and newsprint uniforms - there are no uniforms at English pubs).    We were seated immediately, but there was a slow start to our service which was always rather harried and not particularly friendly.  We started with the warm pretzels ($8) with a white cheddar sauce and seedy English mustard.  The cup with three pretzel sticks were perfect - a nice crispy skin and tender interior.  The creamy and slightly sharp cheese sauce and the gourmet mustard were plentiful and great for dipping (separately and together).  This was a great prelude.  For our entrees, we split the wedge salad and the mixed vegetable salad ($15 and $16 each).  The wedge salad was quite good - baby iceberg was sweet and crisp and topped with grated hardboiled egg, bits of blue cheese and bacon and crispy onions and sat in a bed of creamy blue cheese dressing with a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette on the top.  It was a hearty salad that was at once rich, sweet, salty and tangy.  I would definitely get this again.  The mixed vegetable salad was a melange of spring greens with shaved fennel, carrots and radishes and bits of cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes that were overdressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette and finished with some crunchy caramelized cashews.  Other than the excess dressing, this was a very good salad.    Overall, it was a 3.5 star experience.  I know from experience that the potted chocolate trifle is worth the trip, and the wedge was great as well as the pretzels.  The other salad and the service were not as wonderful, but such is the Vegas food scene.",

Overpriced, (yeah I know I'm in Vegas) but all the more reason that my overpriced meal should look good and taste as good as it looks, even from the menu description.  Chef Ramsey should do an Undercover Boss epipsode just to see what is going on. The spouse and I had a series of small plates since we had just landed and checked into Caesars Palace and did not want to go on a hunt for some snacks.  I ordered the British Cheese Bread just to get a glimpse of what is going on cuisine-wise in the British Isles. Terrible. \"Rye\" bread smothered in some kind of cheddar cheese wiz kinda sauce with a tomato slice buried in there somewhere!  The Smoked Salmon on Toast with truffle cream cheese was a hit but too little smoked salmon swimming in a puddle of cream cheese.  The kettle chips nachos were piled high with some kind of mild red chilies and very little short ribs. They are Gordon's own secret nachos recipe, maybe he forgot to tell the kitchen how to make them.  The small burgers (two to a plate) were quite good as were the wings, but those items two alone would not make me want to walk the gauntlet to get to this place, and we were staying at the resort.",

The Shepards pie was very good except (excellent presentation) for me it was too salty. I liked the bread that came with it. Very good! I must confess that I eat a very low salt diet and my food would not be on par with Ramsey's version of a well-salted meal but I have been traveling all week eating out and no other place I ate was I so overwhelmed with too much salt as I was with the Shepards pie. My daughters steak was excellent.  The wait staff was excellent. He sure knows how to pick a good team.  Something I must mention is the place was loud for me (Ya I am older) but it seemed the cats meow for the younger crowd. Something I picked up while watching his shows was they he believes restaurants should be lively (loud).",

Loved, loved, loved the decor, different sections/seating areas and especially loved the bold,  colored stripes down the middle of the whole restaurant.  I'm a geek for great graphic design and this place kicked some major ass in that regard.  MENU. Not huge (2 large pages), which was totally fine by me because it tells me they are sticking with what they do best. Only 2 vegetarian options for my friend, but a few sides were vegetarian-friendly... just not called out on the menu as such.  As a carnivore, I had more than my share of choices.   SERVICE. Everyone I spoke with (phone-for reservation) and met were very friendly and helpful. Adam Z. was our server, and he was awesome.  Adam was fun, engaging, had the menu details nailed (which greatly helped my friend pick her entree), and a real sweetheart of a guy who made our experience truly memorable.  When you go (when...  NOT if), be sure to ask for Adam Z!  Lastly, THE FOOD.  Ah the food.  Veggie Dish of the Day:  delish.  Bacon Cheeseburger:  excellent. Truffle Fries:  fantastic. (Didn't have the Fish and Chips, but the guy next to me did and they looked heavenly.)  STCKY TOFFEE PUDDING:  THE BEST FOOD (not just limited to desert) IVE EVER EATEN...  EVER!!!   No exaggeration, the sticky toffee pudding is hands down the best thing I've ever had - it's an absolute MUST-HAVE when you go.  I just finished eating and I'm stuffed, but I'm seriously already planning to go back tomorrow just for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and the next night...  Such a cool place with fantastic food. p.s. Consider yourself extra lucky if you get one of the dog chairs like I did. #Bramble",

It came with chips on the side which weren't fresh, and they were a tad too thick for me.   Drinks: 5/5 stars 5 stars for Goodbye Blue Sky! If I remember correctly, it is their best-seller. It has the perfect blend of alcohol and fruity flavor. Definitely a must-try!  Service: 5/5 stars The staff are real friendly! They also gave my aunt newly cooked burgers after she initially complained about the patties being a bit raw.   If you're in Vegas and you want to dine in a celebrity chef's restaurant, I strongly suggest you go to GIADA instead at the 2nd level of The Cromwell. You'll get more value for your money there. It's fancier and it also has a spectacular view!",

I've watched every season of MasterChef/MasterChef Junior and Hell's Kitchen, so I feel like Gordon has subconsciously trained me to know how a decent meal is cooked. Unfortunately, my 1st negative YELP review goes to the fish n chips entree. I remember him on a MasterChef season yelling at a contestant for putting steamy, hot food over fries. Why? Because it makes a soggy mess on the bottom of the fish batter and soggy fries on top. Also, the batter was way too heavy that I scooped out the cod which ended up to be terribly seasoned and bland. Our waiter says that this entree is the most requested..really?! I know he just opened up a fish n chips restaurant, and I hope it's a lot better than what I ordered.   However, my mother ordered the Shepard's Pie which she thoroughly enjoyed. I did appreciate the kind hosts in the front and our waiter who was very friendly and engaging.   Please make sure that soggy fish and chips doesn't get through the pass..you might disappoint more Ramsay fans other than me. Chef Kristin from Hell's Kitchen was my all time FAV, so it might have been just an off day. I'm just pretty bummed that I'm heading back to LA not raving about this place to my friends.",

We waited 15 min before anyone even came over to take our drink orders. We ordered and haven't seen any one for 30 min since we ordered.  I hope the hell the food is good or this review will go down.  I ordered the braised ribs and my wife did the steak pie.  Well let's see what happens.  well, the food was great.  the braised ribs melted in your mouth and the beef pie was a bomb of flavor.  But the service was horrible, our server Richard was slow, he couldn't remember the desert order.  he almost made us late for our show.  Gordon, you need to look into this.",

This time I had the chicken wings which are crispy and super flavorful. The bleu cheese that comes with is about the best I've ever had. We had the hummus and olive appetizer. Again, the hummus is the best I've ever had. Lots of flavor going on here. The Mac and cheese comes in a smaller portion but is good.    On prior visits I've had the steak which is a great choice and worth the money. The hamburgers are smoked and quite enjoyable.   This place can fill up so maybe try coming on off hours. The one complaint I have about Gordon Ramsey's pub is that the service can be slow. I've noticed this with all the times I've been here. The staff is friendly, but you may not see them for a bit between courses. If you're not pressed for time and just want to relax and enjoy your meal, the slow service may not bother you.  Overall, superb food and drink. Not a bad thing on the menu. The level of flavors in every dish are incredible.",

Next, go on open table and make a reservation. It just makes things easier.   We started off with the sea salt malt vinegar crisps. It's just potato chips with aioli and vinegar to dip, but a tasty simple starter.  The fish and chips were $26, even with the Total Rewards discount. It's 2 hunks of fish in a light batter, over skinny fries. No peas anymore. My soda was $4, which my server didn't refill until prompted.   Stephen had the pie sampler which he liked. It didn't look that filling for $18, but he seemed to find it adequate.   Our lunch would've set us back $57 but since I gamble a lot, I used my points and got it complimentary. Score!",

The steak in the pie melted in your mouth which was a nice contrast to the tender veggies and the rich deeply flavored gravy.  The top crust however was lack luster at best.  In my head I could hear Gordon Ramsay berating his expediter for putting up a dish that was undercooked. The crust left a gritty texture in your mouth that detracted from the overall yumminess of the filling.  I was sad.   The Sticky toffee putting quickly put an end to my sadness.  It was everything and beyond.  The sweet cream ice cream was to die for.  The pudding itself, I had to admit was better than mine.",

First of all, the hostesses were obnoxious and seemed to have an attitude when we asked for a regular table, when we were offered a bar-styled table. We had been walking almost all day and needed to sit with our feet firmly planted on the ground - not dangling!!! The servers on the other hand were phenomenal and made the experience of coming here more positive.  Food! Ah! I am a SoCal gal who just happens to be familiar with British pub food and I must say, the food lived up to the expected standards of British blandness! My chicken/seafood salad was excellent, hence the 4 stars, and the Hell Fire wings were pretty good, but definitely did not stand up to the name. My poor husband on the other hand, who ordered fish/mashed potatoes/vegetables was unhappy to say the least! I tasted his food and only the vegetables came out winning.  Gordon Ramsey: you need to understand that Americans like their potatoes mashed NOT liquefied! lol! Anyways, we had fun at this place. Their decor here at this location was very close to the actual old-school British pub atmosphere, minus the mural. Tableware was very interesting to look at!  I would say, anyone passing by a Gordon Ramsey must try it for the sake of trying it!",

I happened to notice from the menu that the burgers came with fries, the sandwiches chips, so when the waitress asked if would we like chips or fries, it was a nice surprise.  We said \"one of each then, great, thank you!\"  End of story. The food was OK. Both sandwiches came on thick toast and quite frankly, started to irritate my mouth. But no biggie. Our waitress then full on disappeared -- never to be seen again. But the bill finally came once we flagged someone else down and both sandwiches rang up at $19.00, and it listed \"truffle fries\" for an extra $3.00. Are you kidding me?  No one ever said anything about an extra charge for fries, nor anything about \"truffle\"!  And after re-checking the menu, it shows \"truffle chips\" something or other as an appetizer. That's the only mention of \"truffle\" anywhere!  Then the manager wanted to say the $19 instead of $18 charge for the sandwiches was the waitress' mistake regarding a \"dinner portion something or other\".   Ohhhh Bull s....    Yea, yea, $5 ...no big deal. I'm sorry....them trying to get us for $5 is a BIG DEAL!    Pretty disappointed Gordon!!!!!!!!",

The service was very quick and attentive. We loved being able to enjoy a nice meal in Vegas, while in a restaurant where we could still hear each other talk. And the deserts are AMAZING.",

Ok, now for the food, I had the wedge salad (get it chopped, you'll never eat it any other way) and shared  a tomato soup to start. Both were delicious and generous portions. We had the Short Rib and the Diver Scallops. I wasn't crazy about the lentils served with the scallops, but they were fresh, tasty and had a wonderful citrus sauce. With my Yelp Check-In, we got the Sticky Toffee Pudding. OMG, it was not what we expected. It looks heavy and dense. Not st all - It was warm, fluffy and delicious. We will def visit again next time we're here in Vegas!",

Minty mushy peas were fresh and complements the dish perfectly. Chips beyond this planet. Not greasy and great season flavors. Everything was seasoned perfectly, no salt, pepper, or tartar sauce needed. It was simply that good. Chips were soo good. I am reminded by eating here as to how important seasoning is. In fact if you look for salt and pepper on the table you're out of luck. There is none. It's loud and busy but FUN! Don't miss this gem inside of Ceasars.",

I wanted to order a bud light for something light with my heavy burger I ordered, but the place didn't carry AB products. The couple next to me was really hungry too, so I told one of them can have my burger when it finally gets out so they don't have to wait as long as I did. If you are going to pay $21 for burger, it should be assumed the price reflects stellar service. I did tell the bartender I shouldn't have to wait over a half hour at the bar when the place is half empty for a burger and he was kind of a jag. No apology, just something about it was the first burger order of the day and then told the couple next to me that \"of coarse he's the first to order a burger and they are checking on it.\" I didn't know how to interpret this, but he said it in a fashion that I was too impatient. I will say that the design of this place is pretty cool. I just don't like this place because it wasted my precious Vegas time!",

    "text": "Worst restaurant experience in my week in Vegas!  I recently visited Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill and was very excited to try it.  Our visit started out very well.  Our server was extremely professional and friendly.  It ended there, however.  I was with a party of four and we all ordered.  I ordered the lamb burger and couldn't wait to taste it, which I never did do.  I specifically asked if the burger had lettuce on it and was told no.  It had some on it when it came and the server stated that it wasn't supposed to be like that so he took it back.  This would have been fine, however, somehow my meal got \"lost\" due to our server needing to wait on a table that had a language barrier.  So I sat while my whole table ate and finished with still no food. When I flagged down our \"new\" server, he seemed not to know what was going on.  I asked for the manager, who was also not aware of the issue.  When I told her, she did offer to get me a meal, but by then it was too late.  I was not about to eat while everyone else waited for me.  She did comp our drinks, but I would have rather had my burger and enjoyed my meal.    I was so disappointed because I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, and if he puts his name on a restaurant, I expect it to be great.  The others in my party did enjoy their meals.  So, ultimately, I left hungry and annoyed!",

    "text": "I went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill and had the worst experience. We were in Las Vegas for my sisters bachelorette party for the weekend, we went there for our last meal together. We had reservations for 9:15 and showed up at 9:10 and got seated immediately. Richard E was our server. He was fast about getting our drinks and complimentary bread and appetizers, but after that he rarely came to check our table. We waited well over an hour before our entrees came out. I confronted a bus boy about how long our food (because our waiter Richard E was nowhere to be found) was taking because we noticed a table of 4 that got seated at least 15-20 mins after us got served before us. He went in the back to check and came back telling me that the reason they got served first was because they have a smaller party and it takes longer for the kitchen to prepare all our meals to come out together....Once the food came out it was okay but definitely not worth the wait and rudeness we experienced. Richard brought one check over without asking us if we were all paying together at the end. We were a party of 8 so we asked if he could split the check for us and he made a huge deal about how long and difficult it would be for him to do it but he guessed he could. It took him 20 mins to do so..which we saw he had finished earlier and was waiting to bring us the split checks...Overall very disappointing for what we thought would be an amazing experience.",

    "text": "Worst service I have ever received in a restaurant!! If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be embarrassed to put my name on it. I was there on New Year's Eve and the restaurant was empty. Their dinner special was 100.00 per person. We asked if they had another option and were given their ala cart menu. My friend and I both ordered the sliders and a pear ale. We waited for a long time for our food to arrive. When it did I was shocked at how small portion was. The sliders were about the size of a half dollar coin and were nothing but bread and dried out burger. I only ate one because I was having a hard time swallowing the dried out mess. After receiving our food our waitress didn't come back. I then asked a busser for a to go box ( I would have just left the food but for those prices I was taking it with me), he didn't return. When we saw him again my friend reminded him I was waiting for a box. He apologized and brought me one. My friend held up her credit card for at least 30 minutes trying to get our waitress to bring our check. Finally when the busser brought my to go box we asked him to get our waitress to bring our check. We noticed that a couple who were seated about the time we got our food had still not had anyone approach their table and take their order by the time we finally got our check. When we received our check we found they had already tacked on a 20 percent gratuity. I guess they do that because they would never receive a tip otherwise. My recommendation.... Don't Go There!!!",

    "text": "Is there a zero star option? Because, that is my rating.  Extremely disappointed and offended. When I arrived at the Pub and Grill, I noticed that the establishment was extremely empty. I thought this was odd since it was New Years Eve and the strip was packed. the hostesses did offer an ala carte menu, as I was not interested in their main menu for the evening. The bar was open seating, so I decided to eat there since other establishments looked really busy.  My friend and I were hungry since we hadn't eaten in a while. At first the waitress seemed very friendly, and she offered us drinks. We ordered a pear ale, and it was very tasty. We didn't see the waitress for quite some time to order our meal. When she arrived, I ordered the sliders. When they arrived I was extremely disappointed. First of all, it took it seemed forever for the food to arrive. Secondly, the burgers were just buns and a burger no toppings. The buggers were the size of a quarter, they were extremely dry, and lacked taste. After visiting Gordon Ramsay's burgers we had very high expectations.  That establishment was phenomenal. Gordon Ramsay's burgers had a very friendly and helpful staff, and excellent, I repeat, excellent tasting food! The sliders that I received from the pub and grill were sub par. After I was finished with the disgusting sliders, I didn't see our waitress to receive our bill for more than 45 minutes. I even held my card up for at least a half an hour with no response. I would have spoken to the restaurant manager, however we were pressed for time for the firework show. I did write a note on the credit card receipt about how it did not compare to Gordon Ramsay burger, and that I was disappointed. To top it off, 20 percent gratuity was automatically charged to the bill. I did not feel that the waitress who neglected us deserved to receive 20 percent. I will not go back to this restaurant, and I will not recommend it to anyone I know. However, I highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay's burgers!!!",

I don't know if it's the rosemary bun or garlic aioli or what but I could't stop eating. And the fries were awesome - also not my usual go-to. I actually went here twice during my visit. Once with my husband (who actually only described the regular burger as \"alright\" which seems weird) and once with girlfriends. I talked up the \"Spots\" so all the girls had them except one who ordered the Diver Scallops. I actually traded her a handful of fries for half a scallop and I think I got the better end of the deal. The hostesses are very whatever, but the bartenders are a good time and our waiter was awesome. Even the food runner had a good time with us. I also like the decor with the kegs working as a divider. I ate at the bar and at a table and liked both options. They also had a good beer menu. I really liked this place. Definitely worth trying out.",

Normally I am very easy going and am not motivated to give a place a bad review (this is my first ever in fact), but in this case I feel like Mr. Ramsay has traded on his name as a stickler for quality and there was little to be found here. We've dined at Gordon Ramsay Steak and it was very good so this came as an unwelcome surprise. The staff were generally nice, though they started to flounder when things went south. We ordered a Caesar to start and I must say that was good. However, for our lunch entrees we ordered the Shepherd's Pie and the baked Mac n' Cheese and were very disappointed with both. The shepherd's pie was average at best but barely had any vegetables in it; the Mac n' Cheese was just terrible: bland and undercooked. When my girlfriend said something about it the genius waiter went right into the classic al dente argument - nice. He offered to have it cooked more - baked more? We sent back the Mac and even with that off the bill it came to $50: one Caesar salad to share, an iced tea, a lemonade, and a small, underwhelming shepherd's pie. If that suits you then look no further!",

The staff seated us write away and we got a nice little area in the back so we can watch the crowd.  The waiter made some recommendations for beers and he was right on.  We ordered just a small quick lunch and I had the mussels and clams and the wife had the salad.  They were both outstanding.  Then the staff came by and asked we wanted dessert and made yet another recommendation and this time was even better than the beer.  The dessert was a toffee cake and it was splendid and I will eat it every time I am in Las Vegas.  I hope they do not change anything about this place, well maybe the girls outfits.",

My wife had sliders and they were nothing special, but not bad.  The shepherds pie my wife had for a main course was fantastic. I had fish and chips for my main. The fish was cooked well, but was a little bland. The chips were awful undercooked oversized potato wedges. They didn't even taste fried, I think they were baked, and the center was still crunchy. They screwed up the second half of this classic pub dish, that's not acceptable.  My real problem was the service. We sat for around twenty minutes with dirty plates on the table before anyone came by. Our waitress was M.I.A. and the rest of the wait staff was too busy standing around chit chatting to clean off the table, refill our drinks, see if we wanted anything, etc.  The iPad with the drink list was also a little ridiculous. Stop with the stupid trendy crap, this is supposed to be a pub.",

What she didn't realize was I had already been drinking those types of beers for many hours that day, but it was late and I was winding down with a Miller Lite. I ordered the Shepard's Pie and Mac & Cheese. Both were delicious. No doubt the best Shepard's Pie and Mac & Cheese I've ever had.  A few days later a I took a couple friends back, and we sat in the dining room. The place wasn't that crowded, but the whole night our waitress kept disappearing, and leaving us hanging. She even apologized on one occasion for being gone for so long. It was actually kind of weird. One of the people I was with asked her what she recommended to eat, and she said everybody loves the fish & chips. When she walked away I told both of my friends how good the shepard's pie and mac & cheese were. My one buddy and myself ordered the fish & chips, and my buddy's wife ordered the shepard's pie. My buddy's wife loved the shepard's pie, but $28.00 for the fish & chips my buddy and myself weren't impressed. When you cut into a piece of fish you expect to see nice flaky fish. This fish wasn't flaky, and it was too greasy. My buddy also ordered the Butternut Squash Soup which he said was delicious.",

Al had the lamb burger and they were both so flavoursome and decent portions which I wasn't expecting. We did not have a long wait for a table either which was an added delight.  The decor was really cool like an English pub and the menu had something for everyone but not to big either. The service was exceptional we actually had a uk waiter who we had a great chat with. The meal was presented well and cooked to perfection. I look forward to our next Vegas trip and will definitely hit this restaurant up again.  The only let down to this meal was that Gordon did not make an appearance while we were there, however look at the picture I post with this I got the next best thing lol!!!",

I get that we are young and filthy rich enough to continuously order glasses of wine, but we deserve to be treated well.  Good was absolutely mediocre. I ordered the two mini burger side and fries (I have small portion size) and my boyfriend ordered chicken sandwich with kettle chips. My mini bacon cheeseburgers were a joke. The picture will show their ridiculous use of ingredients. I paid extra for that bacon. I get that it's a mini cheeseburger, but I think it deserved more cheese and bacon than that. The fries were soggy and not great at all. I had to dunk them in aioli to get decent flavor. My boyfriend's sandwich was eh (according to him) and his kettle chips were stale.  I won't be back. Sorry Gordon.",

You know that feeling when you eat something and it just keeps coming back like a psychotic ex-girlfriend?  It was like that.   In the elevator, overhearing a couple talking about their experience...exactly the same as mine.    Pals from my conference also tried it out, and were also way less than impressed.    I guess our expectations may have been high.  Like a lot of people, I really wanted to see just how good a Ramsay experience could be.  I've lost a lot of respect for the guy.  Granted, this is just his pub, but you would think that good pub food would be easy.    Gordon really should drop by this place for some quality control.  I can't believe that he'd approve of his name on the door when the food is blah at best.  Oh well, it was pretty expensive for fish and chips, but at least I got my money's worth.  First time I've ever had a 24 hour Fish and Chip.",

Because of this, we will be going back when we return to Vegas in November!   The service was great. Very friendly and welcoming. The lobster rolls were amazing!  However our entrees were really disappointing. My husband had the salmon (bland) and I had the short rib (tough and over cooked). Normally I don't make too big of a deal, but if I'm paying almost $40 per entree - I would like to be somewhat satisfied. Anyway, the decor is cute (Gordon's bulldog - love) and again, the staff was great. Just wish we had a better experience with our meal, especially since my husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan!",

I have watched El Gordo on tv when he rants and raves and that is exactly what I wanted to do when I tasted my soft crab at his restaurant.  Relatives came into town and took us there as a special treat many months ago and I just didn't write a timely review. Hah!!!  I  ordered one of my favorite things and was unpleasantly surprised at the lack of taste and the consistency.  I couldn't even see the soft crab because the pastry around it was so thick and so tasteless.  Maybe the head chef should be given a lesson in how to prepare this usually wonderful dish.  And now when El Gordo does his schtick on tv I just have to laugh because I'm not certain he knows how to cook!!! And I don't live in CA but in Henderson, NV.",

As we waited, I noticed that this spot had a great flow of energy and gave off a good vibe. Had a \"bar/pub\" feel to it. Ambiance, music, and energy was great. I'd have to say the stuff was completely on point and went above and beyond in service.   - When the hostess led us to our table, I could smell the delicious aroma of steak. We were guided into the private dining area, which is a private room with TVs, independent light controls, and a single table perfect for 10 people. The room was great. It was well managed and kept clean. I own a cleaning company so I pay attention to details very closely and I was pleased with the cleanliness.  - As for the food, I would have to say it was delicious. I had the ribeye steak with asparagus. Very tender and superb steak. I was pleased that it was not mainly a fatty piece, since ribeyes tend to be on the fattier side. Not this steak though. It was very meaty, juicy, and tender. Best of all, it was cooked exactly how I asked; Medium Rare.",

We made reservations via Yelp, but we were running late because of Las Vegas so I called the restaurant and they were able to hold our table. That was really accommodating, but I just wished our server was as accommodating. Unfortunately he was really slow and standoff-ish. The table next to us I believe won a VIP dinner for Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, so he was focusing his attention on them. The water wasn't refilled until we asked and this poor busboy came running to give us water. Food came out in good timing though.  The food was good, but for the price I paid I expected more. We got the Bangers and Mash as well as Steak and Ale Pie. We also got the sauteed mushrooms and wings. The wings were great, but pricey. The portions were smaller than I expected, but I was full since it was full of mashed potatoes and bread. It was delicious, but it's the type of food that's not too hard to make so we weren't too impressed.  The location is great as it is near the parking structure so you don't have to walk too far. The restaurant itself is pretty comfy, not romantic, so it's best for a group of friends or coworkers. Lots of TVs so it is also great to watch a game.  A plus was that we got to see the Hell's Kitchen winner so that was pretty cool. Overall, it was A-ok.",

GR is all about presentation & plating so i think he may be disappointed to find out my dish came out very messy (or idk, maybe that's how the dish is supposed to be plated??)... see, the carrots and potatoes were randomly scattered on the plate *carelessly* imo, and the steak had a potato and carrot underneath it, like the steak was just plopped on top of the potatoes and carrots :/// i just tweeted pics of the dish from b4 and after i ate it to show the plating, and the raw carrots and fatty steak part i left behind.. dunno if he'll respond at all, but i thought i'd at least notify him of how things were done.. i also got the potted triple chocolate trifle which i LOVED. it was various layers/textures of dark, milk, and white chocolate :)) w/ a couple small cookies on the side.   so i had very mixed feelings about my 1st and likely only experience at a GR restaurant as i doubt i'll have the chance to go back to vegas again (or any other location where his restaurants are). i really did have high expectations w/ his location b/c it's GR! he's all about perfection w/ taste and plating, and of course, he's anti-raw foods lol.. and then there's the horrible server i mentioned b4 who really was frustrating, if i wasn't in such a great mood about the 1st nite in vegas, i would've complained more outwardly at the time, right now, i'm wishing i had... will try to post pics of everything.",

    "text": "Strip casino dining in its purest, most naked state of corporate cynicism. Enormous space packed with unsuspecting diners, a cautiously daring menu, an army of impersonal wait staff buzzing to and fro, European sports on surrounding flat screens--everything about this place feels like it was washed through a series of trend spotting gastro-bots. But at least you get to wait way too long for your food, and as a special feature it's all ridiculously over priced. A pint of bass will run you ten dollars. Ten. Dollars. For a pint. Of Bass. Let that sink in. Two of us ordered fish and chips and one went with hangar steak, all served with French fries. Thirty minutes later plates arrived with luke warm, flaccid fries and serviceable proteins. The fish is substantial yet flaky and comes with a tarragon tartar which is a nice touch, but the whole thing lacks any kind of contrast in flavor or texture. Hangar steak was cooked properly, end of story. Hardly deserving its thirty dollar price tag. The table shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which I have read much about. Moist cake, small scoop of generic vanilla ice cream, and standard warm toffee--enjoyable, but unexceptional. Overall, the \"pub\" fails miserably for how much it promises yet doesn't even attempt to deliver. More proof of the inherent evils of scaling ever upward. Everything about this place, the size, the insane prices, the vague service, the thoughtless dishes, exists merely to support its own fat, bloated fanny.",

Place was very busy even for lunch on a Friday so I recommend using the OpenTable resevation on this place even if it is only an hour ahead of arrival.  Everyone else had to wait at least 30 mins, but we were seated immedately.  I had the Short Rib and Cheek Sandwich which was good but seemed like it needed a little something extra so I added the mustard.  The mustard is very good but be careful the stuff is SPICY.  My wife really liked the Fish and Chips and we loved the Sticky Toffee Pudding.",

We decided to sit in the bar area and were immediately greeted by our bartender Ray Ray. Ray Ray asked us if we were right or left handed as to make it easier to pick up our drinks. After talking to Ray Ray he congratulated us on our wedding. We went back two days later on a Friday and Ray Ray was once again behind the bar and not only remembered us but also remembered we were newlyweds which I found amazing as Gordon Ramsay's is right on the gaming floor in the middle of Cesar's Palace. Ray Ray was once again very hospitable and even gave us a free Sticky Toffee Pudding which was amazing as were the pretzels, deviled eggs, and sliders we ordered. If you are ever in Vegas and want to go to a celebrity chefs restautant make sure to check out Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill.",

I must say I was very disappointed. The food and drinks were a bit pricey for what they were and our service was horrible. I think the expectations of it being a Gordon Ramsey restaurant may have been too high. We had the Fish and Chips and it was very greasy, the flat iron steak had great flavor but for $32, we expected there to be a side item but instead it was served with a small piece of onion. Long story short, after $150.00 we left upset with the service, still a bit hungry, and extremely disappointed.",

The service needs a lot of work as it is dreadfully slow. The time it took just to take our order, receive our drinks and get our bread was pushing 35+ minutes - underscored by the fact that the Pub was at about 70% capacity.   The food was very good. My app and entree was very good as were my buddies'.    I read some comments on here, which are really short sighted. Of course it is expensive - you are in Vegas and at Caesers Palace. I paid $5.90 for a large coffee at the damn food court nearby. Everything is over priced there. Room service for 2 burgers at Caesars was about $75 so compared to room service this is a bargain.  The staff seemed disoriented and somewhat aloof. Not sure what the culture is there, but it is different from the other GR places I've been.  Anyway the place is pretty cool and tv's are everywhere.   It isn't worth making an extra effort to go if you are staying far away but if you are staying at an adjacent property it is worth going to.",

Was promptly seated and had our drunk order taken, but we didn't see the waiter for 15 or so minutes.   We each ordered salad and an entree. It's a good thing I enjoy taking with my girlfriend, because by the time the salad came, I had completely forgotten we ordered them.   Dinner came about 6:30 and was ok. We both ordered the same thing, a small fillet, piece of pork belly, and a couple shrimp. The fillet was cooked perfectly, but the other two items were over cooked at dry.   The manager came over to offer a free dessert for the long wait, which was appreciated. The bill came and the $11 charge was there. The show read starting and I didn't push the issue.  I can go to Flemings, spend 2/3rds the money, and get a perfectly cooked meal. I realize we're paying for his name, but I don't think our meals would have make it out of the kitchen on Hell's Kitchen....  They're plenty busy with the constant traffic in the hotel, but.....",

The tomato soup was served warm, not hot, and the local Safeway does better with its Signature soup line.  The onion soup had a great broth, and the cheese was freshly melted and hot. There were plenty of onions. Unfortunately the broth wasn't hot.  The sliders, bun was toasted, yet cold on the bottom. The meat cooked nicely, but warm at best.  The fries, not hot.  And the candied brussel sprouts? Not hot except right in the center, and the candy, appeared to be maple syrup in the bottom of the dish.  The food came out quickly, so my assumption is it is prepared ahead of time and then assembled when ordered. Perhaps they forgot to turn ob the warming tray.",

I appreciated that they included the tentacle pieces since those are my favorite. What was pretty gross was the pond of grease that was at the bottom of the paper when we finished our meal. The kitchen needs to be a better job of draining the grease before serving.  I had the BLT Duo. I wish I knew it was served cold ahead of time. Cold pork just isn't my thing. The pulled pork was more of a pulled pork salad since it was mixed with a light creamy dressing. A thick cold piece of bacon on top was less than appetizing. Minus a star right there. Again, I wish I knew ahead of time that it was served cold. I would definitely not order this again.  One companion ordered the NY Strip. His comment was that it was much better than the NY steak at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. It came with a tiny portion of fingerling potatoes and asparagus. He asked the server for a piece of bread since the meal was pretty rich. The server said no. He indicated he would need to order the appetizer pretzel bread. This seemed unreasonable as we saw other dishes that had bread. This 80+ year old man wanted a small piece of bread with his steak. Seriously, the waiter should have brought him a piece of bread on the house. It's not like we didn't each order a full meal, plus appetizer and drinks from the bar. They lost 2 stars and a percentage of their tip right there.   The other companion ordered the curry chicken. It's an Indian curry served with a side of chutney. I thought it was just ok, but my companion really liked it. By the end of the meal he was sweating from the spices.  One last point: The seating is meant to be like a pub. Each table had different style of chairs and tables. Some were regular restaurant table and chairs, there was also traditional bar seating and other tables that were homey with high backed sitting room style chairs. We were seated on a raised table with high bar stool seats. It wasn't my preference to eat dinner on stools without back support. I wish the hostess checked in with us about this prior to seating, especially considering we had a senior citizen in our party. Minus one star for lack of consideration for any special needs of our party.",

It had basil in it which was a good surprise. The only thing I found odd was that the bacon was crushed or chopped instead of strips of bacon so the bacon kept falling out when I was trying to eat it.  Everyone else in my group said their food was good. No complaints. Service was pretty good. They were pretty attentive.",

You'd think that a quasi English pub would serve thick \"chips\" not these thin fries.  Not an original presentation of fries either.  Hell, even Chili's is putting fries in metal baskets now.

    "text": "I want to give 4.5 but alas I cannot. So, here it goes, the Ramsay Pub and Grill review. :) knowing we were going to Vegas, we knew we wanted to try one of Ramsay's places.  We love his shows and wanted to try his food.  We decided on the Pub and Grill. We made reservations via Open Table. About a week before, we got a message on our home answering machine from the restaurant. We were being bumped, a VIP came in and bought out the restaurant for the night we were going to be there. They were very accommodating and worked to get us in while we were there. The evening finally arrived. We got there a little early and were seated immediately. This is where they lose the half star. I sat in a chair and felt like I was on the floor. My chin, literally scrapping the table?! What is up with the chairs? Our waitress and another staff were very helpful though to get us \"big people\" chairs. I quite literally needed a booster to reach the table appropriately. But the dinner got better. We started with drinks. I chose the blue sky, sweet and yummy! I am a sucker for a sweeter mixed drink. The hubby chose a beer on tap, all I know though is that it was a heffeweizen. It was delightful though. We picked apps. The beer nuts which come with a variety: sweet, salty, and spicy. I didn't try the spicy but the hubby liked them a lot. I tried the sweet and the salty. They were delicious. We also got the lobster roll app. Two small rolls filled with an awesomely good lobster roll filling. For our main dishes...the hubby got the fish and chips which comes with  mushy peas. I have never heard of mushy peas but wow...how interesting who would have thought that peas and mint would taste so good together. Wow! What flavors! I chose the Scottish salmon and this came with cauliflower. Wow! Best salmon ever! The skin tasted so good! And the fish cooked perfectly, flaking off, so fresh. Cauliflower was delightful too. Just a really good dinner. The food was just really quite good. I would visit again!",

    "text": "It was awful trying to find a decent lunch spot for the July 4th weekend at Caesar's. Bacchanal had a nearly 90 minute wait for a $53 brunch and we were denied at Mesa Grill because they had a dress code for lunch (screw you Flay). Our fallback was the more casual Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.  Anything with Ramsay's namesake should scream quality and consistency, but most of the plates fell short of expectations. We started off with the little piggy deviled eggs, which were presented with the yolk separated for self-serving. From there, I went with the shepherd's pie, which came lukewarm. The mashed potatoes had an unpleasant texture and I didn't get much of the cheddar cheese. The ground lamb and peas had no distinguishing flavor. The steak & ale pot pie came off as salty, but at least I enjoyed the crust.   The sides we tried included the truffle fries and the lobster mac & cheese. The fries were far too similar to the regular fries and didn't have enough truffle oil. The lobster mac & cheese was worse than the Kraft blue box. While there was a generous helping of lobster meat, the mac & cheese itself was very watery and no crispy crust. We declined the popular sticky toffee pudding for next time.  Our waitress was great and sold us on their imported beer menu. Her entertaining small talk was probably the highlight of our meal.",

I could only finish half of it.  - Our server was really nice and gave us free pens at the end of our meal (sucker for free stuff..)  Cons... one kinda big con actually.... - When we arrived we had no reservations, BUT we saw the entire front section was open with about 15 tables or so. However, when we asked for a table, they told us there was a 30 minute wait...but their were tons of available tables... none the less we were all hot and tired and decided to just wait it out and ended up only waiting 15 minutes, but still...you would think with all those available tables they could give our small group of 4 one table.

My husband enjoyed his lamb burger but thought there was way too much feta spread on it. I had the sliders, which were a bit dry, and chips with truffle aioli, which were excellent: crispy, lightly salted, and the mayo wasn't overpowering. Dessert was the best part. His famous sticky toffee pudding definitely lives up to the hype.",

We both loved the extensive amount of beers on tap!  We were served complimentary pretzel bread with a sharp cheddar cheese spread that I could have just eaten as my meal - Delish! Since it's pretty cold here right now I started with the english ale onion soup which was an even better version than french onion soup. It was rich and very filling.   My date had the pub beef burger with ginormous fries..I totally wanted what he had. Sadly, he demolished the whole plate so I didn't even get a taste but that's what I'm getting next time.   The server really sold us on the sticky toffee pudding with sweet cream ice cream. I was in heaven..  I took away half a star only because they have huge flat screen tv's at each table and my date was glued to it since the game was on.

We shared 3 apps: shrimp cocktail, sliders, and lobster rolls.  I guess the best way to say it is I don't really remember any of them.  The lobster rolls were more veggie than lobster and the burgers were totally lacking in flavor.  Our server (who had to wear such a terrible outfit- felt so sorry for her) was nice, but service was really slow.  We did order the sticky pudding and I have to say THAT was delicious, the redeeming part of the meal, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal enough that I would go back.",

    "text": "After a disappointing foray into Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill at the MGM, I didn't hold out much hope for the whole celebrity chef restaurant thing.  I'm glad to have been proven wrong at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill in Caesar's Palace.  My friend and I were in there at around 2:00 on a Sunday.  The place was hoppin', but we found a couple of seats at the bar and were promptly greeted by a really friendly bartender.  I asked him a few questions about the beer selection, describing the flavor profiles that I like.  He brought me several samples and was able to speak knowledgeably about the vast array of beers on offer.  I know it's kind of lame, but in the end I decided to stick with Peroni.  Hey, it was 109 degrees out, I had just walked all over creation, and I wanted something on the lighter but flavorful side.    My friend had a couple of mojitos, prepared by the same bartender.  She said they were amazing.  We both ordered the burger.  My friend ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We both opted for the cheese and bacon toppings (because you just kind of have to, right?).  We both had gruyere.  It was melted, nutty, aromatic, and delicious.  The bacon, while thick, was still very crispy, and richly maple flavored.  It was a delicious meal with layer upon layer of fantastic flavors.    My friend ordered dessert (some rhubarb tart) and she said it was delicious.    My meal (burger, fries, two imperial pints) put me back $40.  Not bad at all.  I highly recommend this place.  Give Wolfgang a miss and come straight to Gordon!!",

What I thought would be fresh, seasoned lobster over amazing fresh bread ended up being a mediocre cole slaw concoction  over a cold lemon poppyseed bread. Could have been great but tasted old and like it came off of an assembly line. Nothing special about it and felt like no passion or time went into it. Maybe the other dishes are better, but after the disappointing first dish we closed our check. Sadly won't be returning. Decent beer selection though.",

We were staying at Caesar's Palace, and were looking for someplace to eat lunch.  We decided to stop in, with the plan to get a drink and an overpriced lunch.  We were fortunate that the restaurant week menu was still active, with a $30 three course price fixe menu.  It was a great deal.  We both had the chopped salad, which was a step above most.  Crisp, fresh items, tossed with a tasty dressing.  Generous portion as well.  The salmon entree was amazing.  Perfectly prepared, with amazing sides.  Then there is the sticky toffee pudding.  Served warm with home made ice cream and with hot caramel poured over it table side.  Arguably the best dessert I have ever eaten.  Nice selection of beers and wines.  Worth it if you can get the price fixe menu.",

I tried to ask the bartenders and they don't know either.   Came here on a Friday night. It seemed pretty busy. Not a huge wait though. We walked up to the bar and got a seat. I preferred the bar because there were TVs and I like to socialize with the bartenders. However these bartenders were not very friendly. They seemed cold and was all business. We asked to change a channel on a TV to watch one of the March Madness games since there were at least 2 other TVs that were showing the same game. Not sure if they heard us or not, but no response. Finally after asking several times, one of the bartenders said that they had to ask the manager if they can change the channel. However, no urgency to go ask the manager. He just stood there doing something with the register. O-Kay...   As the night progressed, the bartenders got a little bit more socialable. They recommended the poutine with duck. It was A-Mazing! We had few Magic Hat beers which was a perfect match the to poutine.   Overall, the service needs a bit more help. The restaurant is great for any sports enthusiast. Lots of TV and some tables had their own TVs! I only had the duck poutine but was ridiculous good!",

When the newspaper started getting wet, any attempts at cutting the fish resulted in shredded newspaper. I ended up eating two or three news articles along with my meal.

Waitress didn't give fiance a spoon for Shepard's pie (or offer to). I had I ask for salt and pepper, which took a long time for her to return with it.   I think if we are paying $25+ per dish, the wait staff needs to be more attentive. She was not only slow, but she never checked on us. Food was ok... I wouldn't pay $30 for fish and chips.....

    "text": "I came here with friends a while back.  I really loved it here.   I'm mildly obsessed with Gordon.  I watch everything of his that I'm able to, having access to only what's on Netflix and Hulu, so when I saw that he opened a pub here, I jumped at the chance to go...especially since its a lot more affordable than the steak house. (still dying to try that one.)  For starters, we had the Warm Salty Pretzels, with the beer cheddar and mustard spreads.  These were absolutely delicious.  Good thing we split them between four people, because I could have filled up on those alone.    We each got a sandwich/burger each: Welsh Rarebit Ham Sandwich:  I hate ham.  I really do.  But I wanted to try a bite of this sandwich so that I could say that I was brave and ate ham JUST because it was at a GR restaurant.  It was reallly good.  Open faced sandwich with lots of flavor.  My only complaint is that my first bite fell into my beer. :(  that was totally my fault though. lol  Pub Lamb Burger:  The menu gives you the option of feta or goats cheese.  My friend opted for the goats cheese, and I think this is the perfect decision.  The lamb burger was just a touch on the dry side, so the feta might have taken away from the taste of the burger.  With the goats cheese, it was flavorful and pretty good.  I'd order it, but like it a little less well done.    Pub Beef Burger:  This is the one I got.  Of course, I added the applewood smoked bacon. (duh.)  I loved it.  I thought it was the best tasting meal of the group.  Not only that, but the beer that I chose (Lucky Buddha) went with the burger perfectly.  It was a good size, very juicy, and perfectly cooked.    I'm kind of ashamed to say right now that I might have gone too long in writing this review to remember the fourth sandwich.  I could have SWORN that my friend had a corned beef sandwich, but I'm not seeing it anywhere on the menu.  So it might have been the beef cheek one, but I'm not going to review because I don't recall.  Whatever it was, it was really flavorful. :D  I loved how the sandwiches were all served with REAL chips...they were perfect as well.  Not a single one was over cooked, and they were't super greasy either.  I will definitely be going back, and hope to save room to try the sticky toffee pudding next time.    The staff was awesome, and I love the decor.  We were seated at a \"coffee table\" type setting with two love seats.  It was right in the middle of the restaurant, where I could watch the football matches in the other room (real football, not American.) :D    I felt that the price was good for the quality of the food.  4 of us ate AND drank for about $100.  Not too shabby.    Hm.  Maybe I'll go back this weekend... ;)  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm getting hungry again. :D",

My aunt decided to visit me in sin city this past weekend and this was the first restaurant on her list that she wanted to try.  We arrived at about 3 on a Saturday afternoon and there was only about a 10 minutes wait.  We were seated by the very sweet host.   We were seated on the side near the walkway  Truffle Chips - They are huge!!  They are about 1in x 1in x 3in.  I heard they are boiled, baked, and deep fried to give it that wonderful consistency.  The Truffle Chips are special because they drizzle it with wonderful scrumptious truffle oil and top it off with truffle shavings.  There are also two dipping sauces one tomato based and the other has a creamier consistency  Pub Lamb Burger - This burger comes with a good sized lamb patty that is cooked to order.  Topped with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  You also get a side of their giant chips.  If you are a beer drinker I recommend pairing it with a bottle of Delirium :)  I took off one star because of the tight seating situation.  My aunt and I were seated near the edge of the restaurant and we could barely get in and out of seats.  I'm not sure if all parts of the restaurant are like this, but it was pretty uncomfortable.  I really enjoyed my experience (minus the seating issue).  I can see myself coming back in the future if I have more visitors, but I will be sure to try and sit in a different section.   TIP:  I recommend parking at the self parking near the Forum.  Once you come off the elevators turn right and you will run right into the Pub & Grill  Bust out your Total Rewards Card (the players club card for the Harrah's Casinos) and save a buck or two on every item.",

    "text": "I normally write separate reviews for each visit but these visits are only days apart.   VISIT #1 I came with some Yelperazzis for a snack before a Yelp event ( yes, we ate before a food sampling event and we went to eat after that too). We just decided to share some bits at the recommendation of David who has tried a extensive bit of the menu.   The short rib and beef cheek sandwich was the star for me. It was beautifully braised and tender and I love their housemade stone ground mustard with a horseradish kick.   I hate when a place can make a Shepherds pie that puts mine to shame (and I know mine is fucking delicious) but this did me in. I like that its a combo of lamb and beef and the gravy of it was savory and worth sopping up if there's some left after devouring (save a piece of bread or ask for some!).   The deviled eggs were good in that the bacon does add a kick to it, but to me a deviled egg is just alright.   Pei mussels and clams were perfectly cooked and the broth with it was solid and had a nice saffron flavor.  I got the Magic Hat #9 to drink which was nice and freshly apricot to cut the richness of the food.   Service was on point. Lovely, funny, enthusiastic Elise took such great care of us, filled our drinks, checked in on us, gave great recommendations and got us checked out in a flash.    VISIT #2  A few days later I return for my BFs friends birthday with a large party of 10 people. It was much busier on a Saturday night than the weekday we came.   The BF and I got the duck confit poutine to start as I really wanted it when I came last but they were out. I say it's rather good and comforting, lots of shredded confit to go around for each bite of fries. I don't know if I would call it poutine as I normally have a much thicker gravy, but this au jus gravy situation was densely rich. We tried bites of our friends scotch egg which was a great version of a dish I am a big fan of. One friend got some pub spot sliders which was okay but a bit too well done for my taste.   The BF got fish and chips which I thought was a solidly done one. I definitely am a fan of their tartar sauce! They don't give you malt vinegar automatically but ask if you want it. They have this garlic aioli that came with someones order but I asked for more to dip the steak fries in. If you love aioli on potatoes like I do, it'll elevate your fries.   I got the Irish beef cheek stew and fuck me sideways it was so tender and perfect. I did need some more potato but people kept throwing me their log fries so I mashed that into the jus and aaahhh, noms. Clean plate of course. Between this, the short rib and cheek sandwich this place knows how to braise meat to meltingly tender.   I had to get some sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious. It's one of my all time favorite comforts and theirs was definitely everything this is supposed to be. People wanted to taste and inside in my head was screaming \"no, no, no\" while I shared nicely like my mommy taught me.   Everyone was happy with their food. One of our friends orders wasn't put in... It worked out since there was no way another friend could finish their sandwich so they shared and they expedited a duck confit poutine for him.   Service was decent enough from our server and another server helping our table with water a few times. The person who white knighted the service though was our busser David that helped get all our random sauces and got to some ignored sodas and waters a few times.   The thing that really blew chunks was we were held hostage for the bill. People shoulda spoke up to maybe split before things were even ordered so that part was our fault, but the way it was split was so inefficient. Went to one person and asked what they ordered and then disappeared and going one by one and coming back to recheck and check again and again which is which. He came to ask us what we had twice after the first time.   Split checks during my first visit was painless. She tabbed which person is whose on one big check then came with one check back that split it into seat #1, #2, #3, etc. to make sure it was right then paired the card/cash to the seat and came back with our individual receipts - done. This took forever this time when I really think it shouldn't have been that hard to get items to the right person. A little wait was expected, but we waited almost as long for checks than our entire meal duration. One friend was salty they got attitude from the server about the bill? I did not witness or asked for a elaboration. Apparently this place also runs with having a cashier settle bills for the servers and they only have one? This place is packed so I think they may need another if a lot of people are waiting.   Pleased with the food and my first visit but coming with a smaller party at non peak hours to sit in Elises section! I'll average it to a 4stars as \"I'm a fan\", but warn big parties to handle splitting yourself and don't come when busy!  (Yelp 100 Challenge 13/100)",

    "text": "My friend and I came here on a Saturday night after we saw a sign saying that Hell's Kitchen was closed for a private event. We were told it was a 25 minute wait but luckily we were seated in less than 10 minutes. They don't have pagers, so there were just a bunch of people standing immediately in front of the restaurant waiting. There are penny slots very close by if you want to gamble while you wait but I'd recommend staying close by and not going by the quoted time.  We split the poutine, chicken wings, and kale salad. Everything was adequate, not especially good or bad. The poutine was annoying to eat because the cheese was melted in a single mound on top instead of dispersed throughout. The chicken wings had a lot of skin/fat on the ends and could have been trimmed more. The kale salad was my favorite and I liked that there was a lot of vinegar in the honey mustard dressing, the bite of the vinegar was very refreshing against the heaviness/fattiness of the other dishes we ordered.  Our server was fine and accommodating and got us in and out of there without rushing us. Overall fine if you're staying or seeing a show closeby, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for.",

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and have watched every reality show he has produced in the U. S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas, all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me, \"You better eat at one of my restaurants, you f***ing donkey!\"     With those inspiring words resonating in my head, I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the \"Untraditional Thanksgiving.\"   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear for a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.  One of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) , the table settings ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ), you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!  Once we were seated at a half booth table, our server came over, took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters, Soups & Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers, Seasonal Choices, Pies, Oak-Fired Grill Entrees, Classic Entrees, Sides and Desserts.  For my wife, her entree was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips, I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) Starter item.  The Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada), but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes, molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!  Our entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter, but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes, but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.  My steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish, just a bit on the small side.  The pastry was a perfect golden brown and flaky.  This is a very hearty entree and there was a good amount of tender steak, 'shrooms and root veggies.  I am just not sure the quality makes up for the lack of quantity when you consider the price tag ($24.00).    For dessert, we selected the Potted Chocolate Triffle ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=4KSMWCaEumIG2DXwpsqF9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a> ) which came with two mini chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  Rohlinism:  It isn't Thanksgiving dinner without a fattening dessert!  Laina was basically full, but always manages to find extra room for chocolaty delicious desserts.  The triffle was topped with white chocolate shavings and round dark chocolate crisps.  The mixture of dark and milk chocolate was fantastic and the Chantilly cream put this dessert on another level!  Fantastic way to end the meal!  Service was really good for the most part.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly at 7:00 pm (love that British punctuality).  Our server was efficient and answered all our questions (or asked someone who knew), but he could have benefited from a personality transplant.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but that is to be expected and you can get $1.00 off most items by joining Total Rewards.  Overall, I was impressed enough with the food to return in the future.",

Lobster Mac cheese had 2 tiny lobster pieces the size of small thumbs, fish and chips were bland, the chips were luke warm, Sheppard's pie was bland served with pretzel roll that was cold and hard.  Our server didn't ask us on how the food was. When we said we didn't like the food, she hurried up to pick up the Mac and cheese and removed it from the bill. Manager didn't even come to see us.. I've dined in many good & high end places, a manager always came to our table if there was something wrong with food/service. I wonder if Ramsay knew how the staff run his restaurants. For a chef that barked and screamed to his staff over bad service and food he really should come to this location. So far it was the worse $100+ dinner I've ever experienced.  If I could dispute this charge with my credit card company, I really would!",

Also ordered the nachos and they were great.  Kettle chips with onions and peppers, short ribs and a cheese sauce over them.. yes please!  My group ordered wings and gave them a positive review as well.   Menu prices are steep otherwise.  $30 for fish and chips  There is a Gordon Ramsey fish and chips place on the Linq promenade that serves the exact same fish so if that's what your after, it's a much more affordable and fun option.",

    "text": "So I was hyped for this. Spent hundreds of hours watching Gordon bite off the heads off of incompetent managers like Ozzy Osbourne, I was ready to get some real food.  So my girl and I stroll in at about 7pm, I order a gigantic 32oz Guinness because I'm a whore and I wanted to see what wierd stuff I can throw my money at.  Beef Wellington wasn't on this menu and I just didn't feel as depressed as should have to order fish and chips for $29. I went with the Chicken Curry.  It was still under Gordon's signature stuff so I was expecting something distinct or different, but It was pretty standard curry.  Good rice, good meat, nothing to write home about.  I've had better curries at small Indian joints when I lived in the East Bay.  My girlfriend got the Hells kitchen burger and ate it like a lion devouring a gazelle. I can't look at her the same way anymore.  We decided to try out the toffee pudding at the suggestion by our waitress and my God was that a good decision. However one caveat, when she delivered it she grabbed the giant cup of caramel and just poured it immediately.  I wanted to pour the caramel. Like my hopes and dreams the opportunity to pour the caramel has been taken from me.  The whole dessert was unbelievable though. I'm going to be scouring the internet to find a recipe that will allow me to recreate it at home.  All in all, it was good, little overpriced, nothing Earth shattering, but it's still an interesting place to eat if you're a fan. I would not recommend this place for tinder dates. Unless you know they're paying.",

Come in for dessert (doesn't matter if it's before your meal, after your meal, or in-between your meal) and a drink.   The only two things you want when you come here are the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Innis and Gunn beer that pairs perfectly with it.  Imagine the sweet, liquefied caramel just running itself down the sides of a crispy toffee mounted inside ice cream, layered on top of one of the softest bread puddings you'll find. Every spoonful of this dessert is a touch of heaven's bliss.  1. Take a spoonful of that sticky toffee pudding 2. Then a good sip of the Innis and Gunn 3. Proceed to smile as your mouth spins in orgasms 4. Return to step 1 and repeat all steps again, until there is nothing left.   Heavenly, truly.  -- Side note, I've had the food here and to be honest the stuff is good (as expected of Gordon and Ramsay), but all incredibly overpriced. I mean, $30 for regular fish & chips -- really, Gordon? Anyway. The sticky toffee pudding and Innis and Gunn..that is all you need here. Grab your meal elsewhere. :)",

Three of us went for dinner here on Friday evening. For appetizers, we had the wings (which were excellent) and shrimp cocktail (nothing special). Then ordered the main courses of butter chicken (good, but cold) fish and chips (2 pieces of fish, not that big) which was average in flavor, and the short ribs, which had no seasoning what so ever on them.  Service was good. All the staff were very friendly. However, we were kind of disappointed with the whole experience based on the food and knowledge of Ramsay reputation. Hopefully the chefs just had an off day this time around and will be more attentive if we decide ever to go back to this place again.",

    "text": "My family and I dined here last week, and it was a GREAT experience, top to bottom!  We arrived for our reservation, and were seated promptly.  We were hopeful this was a good indication of the service to come, and we were right.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly and really added to our overall dining experience.  (I'm just sorry that no one in our group remembers her name - oops!)  We were a party of four, and here is what we ordered: Starters: crispy calamari and kettle chip nachos Entrees: grilled lamb burgers x2, 8oz. beef tenderloin and beer braised short ribs Sides: grilled asparagus Desserts: potted chocolate trifle and mum's apple tart  We learned from our friendly server that Darin and Randy were our chefs for the evening.  They came out and greeted us, and we were able to compliment them on this delicious meal.  The calamari wasn't greasy or overly fried, it was perfectly light and flavorful.  The kettle chip nachos were one of the highlights of the night; the chips were crunchy and solidly held the shot ribs and cheese.  Our party devoured these!!  Lamb burgers were juicy and a nice change of pace for a burger.  The tenderloin was the perfect size for me, so tender and such a great fit with the potatoes.  I originally got the brandy sauce, but it was too sweet, which I told our waitress when she asked.  She kindly and quickly brought me an alternative, a white sauce (don't remember the name!) that was much better.  My husband felt the beer braised short ribs were one of the best entrees he's ever had - a THICK piece of meat that just melted when his fork touched it.  Carrots are one of my favorite things, and the caramelized ones that were served with the short ribs were the exact right amount of sweetness.  And then there was the dessert: both excellent, again - our table inhaled every bite!  The chocolate dessert was VERY rich and chocolatey, so you definitely have to be a hardcore chocolate-lover to enjoy this one.  The apple tart was light and fluffy and the ice cream tasted fresh and not overly sweet.  We left full and happy.  This was a dining experience that FAR exceeded all of our expectations.  We were fully wowed by Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill, as well as Darin and Randy and all of their wonderful staff.",

Not that I need to get boozy, for $15, I just expect more.   We started with the calamari. There were bacon pieces in...of course it made it over the top delicious. Delightfully fried and light on the oil and perfect crunch. Maybe the oil was just changed or maybe it's always good.  I had the lamb burger. I ordered it medium temp. which I realize now was my mistake. Medium rare is the way to go as that is how I had it last time. This time there were parts of the burger that were charred to a crispy blackness which were unappetizing. Come on...that's amateur. However the truffle fries saved me. Their always delectable and never in need of dipping sauce. The black truffle was plentiful; my favorite!  Always a fun place to meet good friends.",

I was expecting my socks to be knocked off. I had the beef burger with bacon and the wife had the lamb burger. Both were decent but that's it. A decent burger isn't worth $20. Menu is super small, which is okay in one sense. Do fewer things but do them better. But these really aren't \"better\". I'd say a five-guys burger is better than this, and at only a quarter the price.   Pretzel appetizer was pretty good but a little lean. I'll have to try Burgr next time I fly into Vegas. Hopefully with better results.",

    "text": "Let's have a discussion about the term \"over-extending.\"  Or if that proves to be a non-starter, how about \"Celebrity Chef.\"  Was in Vegas on a recent guys weekend, and had set up a few reservations a month or so in advance.  This happened to be one of those \"filler\" nights where I tagged along with what was fast and easy before a show.  I should have known better.  Listen, it would be far more difficult to skewer a place, if its owner and Executive Chef weren't on TV every other night berating contestants over one flaw or another while simultaneously puffing his chest and pimping his brand.    Either Gordon Ramsey has never eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill, or he's full of shit.  For starters, the place is so fully \"in the casino\" you can't really differentiate between the scent of the beer steamed clams, and the cigarette smoke wafting around you as you attempt to chew.  Ordered the \"Calimari and Bacon Crackle\" for an app.  I'm not sure what exactly makes it part bacon, but I actually counted the pieces of finger-nail sized bacon in my cone of calamari and there were 4.  Besides marketing to a ravenous for all things pig consumer base, I can think of no worldly reason for the word \"Bacon\" to be in this dish.  The calamari were cooked well with utilitarian dipping sauces.  Sprang for the Herb Caesar Salad w/ Chicken for an entree in a feeble attempt to incorporate a vegetable into a meal during the stay.  I am not kidding when I say that Applebees serves a better chicken Caesar salad.  This salad is 23 dollars.  Twenty three dollars. The chicken breast (and I use that term loosely) that came on top had the texture somewhere between a tire and a silicone breast implant.  If it was not cooked via microwave I will literally give Gordon Ramsey the entirety of my craps earnings. This salad was atrocious.  Minimally dressed and lacking in every viable flavor that usually makes its way into a Caesar.  Service started out decently, but then we turned into an afterthought.  Cocktails were surprisingly good.  This takes me back to my opening sentence.  This experience has soiled me on the name Gordon Ramsey.  I have zero desire to ever set foot in another one of his establishments.  For every contestant on another one of his shows, please point to this restaurant when you get scolded on the inadequate ratio of crust to filling in your apple pie.  That is all.",

Really the ONLY reason I am giving it 3 Stars. #2 - If The Hell's Kitchen Chef was in this house last night, he would have lost his S#&T over the Food Quality and presentation. #3 - Appetizer! i ordered the Chef's Concept of PIG'S in a Blanket. This was the best of the food items I ordered. The Mustard and HR Sauce to Dip was very good. #4 - I thought I would try his take on fish and chips! OMG this was a greasy, semi warm plate of YUCK. The fish fillets were stacked on top of one another and it turn them into a gloppie ( is that a word ) soggy mess. The Chips were just awful!!! Under cooked greasy and I just watched a show earlier in the month Master Chef where they tried to replicate Perfect French Fries / . The Chef wouldn't have served this to his dog!!. Really Fish & Chips at a premiere english pub, owned by the man and it just sucked!! #5 - At least the Ice Tea wasn't F#&Ked up LOL!! $62 with 20 % gratuity added in total, because like I said at least the service was great.  I live in the Las Vegas Marketplace in Henderson, The other Ramsay Group restaurant s I have visited have been exceptional _ Burgr/ Steakhouse / so this was a total downer.  Never again at the PUB!!",

We even joked with the server about who would get the last piece if they ran out.  3 of us ordered it.  We also ordered an appetizer.  About 30 minutes later she comes back and tells us they are out of prime rib. No kidding. Somehow it took 30 minutes to let us know they were out.  I ordered the ribeye instead. I then realized we hadn't even gotten our appetizer. I asked her to include an extra app of wings since now everyone was starving.    Much like our experience earlier that day at the Cafe Americano, our server then stopped coming back to our table. Food runners brought everything out.  My steak was pretty good. Another person in our party never got part of his order and had to cancel it.    We asked her to split up the check and she brought out one bill with each party separated.  Of course a 20% was automatically added.  So I guess I now see why she had no interest in coming back to the table.  I know this is common but this is the result.  I will not return to this place.",

    "text": "Going to a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant we were expecting the best. Especially when Gordon Ramsay is on his restaurant show telling other people that their food is shit. Well, this shit wasn't far from it!  We came in for happy hour and it was less than impressed. Service was slow, yet they were not even close to being busy. Our sever took at least 10 minutes before she greeted us. We did notice she enjoyed visiting the staff more than serving guests.  When she did come to see us we ordered asap since we did not know when she was going to come back. We each ordered the the $5 pulled pork sandwich. It was tiny for $5 and the flavor was not there. We also ordered onion rings and those were served with some kind of port demi sauce.  What the heck was that?  It said on the menu and aioli.  We asked the sever if the demi sauce was right and she said no. So she replaced it later when we only had two onions rings left.  Oh goodie.  We also ordered the wedge salad which is $16.  Now, when you order a wedge salad, it comes with a blue cheese dressing. Why in the world would it come out soaked in a vinaigrette on top of blue cheese dressing?  Is that a British thing?  The combination of the two was not good.  I can't say we plan on returning due to poor service and so-so food.  We were both really surprised that the food and service wasn't up to par since Gordon Ramsay was at Caesar's Palace the following day for the 50th anniversary of the casino.",

Despite being 50% empty at 5PM, we ended up being told we couldn't be seated until 8:45PM. Still, 2 minutes later via use of the opentable app, I had a reservation in hand for 6PM and killed an hour at the tables prior to getting seated in a half-empty house.  Figuring we were at a british pub, I did the fish and chips w. mushy peas, and skipped a starter as we had an awesome lunch earlier and weren't super hungry.  Despite the pleasant service from the Gary Busey lookalike waiter, the food arrived scalding hot, as we downed our first pints.   The chips were undercooked and scaling hot (as my buddy got a side of chips that were a bit crisper with his dish).  The fish was super-oily, and despite the newspaper themed dresses worn by the hostesses, it wasn't served over any sort of newspaper/newspaper style wax paper.  The mushy peas were pretty good.  As we were leaving after finishing dinner, the restaurant was still 1/3 empty.   No idea what was up with their reservation system, as we were told we'd need to wait 3.5 hours for a table at 5PM, got a table via opentable at 6PM and were seated in a half-empty house, and when leaving at 6:45PM, left a restaurant that was 1/3 empty.  Also, given the pricing (significantly higher than Aria's Todd English P.U.B.), and non-quality of the food, I'm not looking to return on my next venture to Vegas.",

The server said, \"I told them to make sure it's hot\" and then the manager returned the soup to the kitchen.  The steaks were pretty good, but then we ordered cappuccino with our chocolate desert.   Desert arrived and the server said our cappuccinos were on the way.  We finished desert and then the cappuccinos arrived - mine was room temperature - not one sip - not even the cup was warm!!!  My husbands was warm to the touch but not much more.  The server deducted them from our bill, but what a huge disappointment when they fail at the basics.",

She suggested the nachos to start and they were great. Great crunch from fresh made chips that stayed crunchy. I liked the combination of flavors and how well the dish was made. Brianna suggested the curry dish for my main and I enjoyed greatly and finished lunch with the cheesecake she suggested. Great service and nice having someone who knew the menu and could help me with selections.

First off it should have been called the sausage variety platter in mush! 3 different variety of sausage, one of which was a banger and it tasted fine. For a reason that escapes me they dumped steamed spinach over the mashed potatoes making them a soupy mess. Onion gravy was the only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1. 1 of the sausages was some sort of smoked thing that tasted some where between a nathan hot dog and a sausage you would get at a texas bbq, weird...

Let me start by saying that the quality of the food was very good, and truly that should be the important part right? The service however...ugh. Husband and I came in Xmas Eve, dressed to the nines as we were going to a show that night...the hostess put us on a tiny crappy table stuck by a beverage cart and then she walked away without asking if it was ok...I don't like to make waves on a busy service night, so I didn't complain, but we had a reservation made over 10 days previous and it would have been nice to have a decent table when we were obviously dressed for a nice dinner.  Our server was then clueless to anything.  He was slow, did not have a good knowledge of the menu, and was not genuine in his approach to our questions.  When he asked us for our drink order  we were very specific in what we wanted.  I specifically asked him if he had a particular liquor,& I overhead him ask his co-worker about it,  and we could tell they had no idea. He then placed the order..?  Out of concern I then walked the 10 paces to the bar and found out myself that indeed they did NOT have what I wanted.  Low and behold, my drink arrives. The server tried to pawn off a drink as the one that I wanted....Furious. If someone is going to take initiative and ask me to try a drink in place of one that I want, I'm ok with that....However, to pretend to give me what I want, and pretend knowing otherwise angers me. These drinks are $20 bucks a piece, so I am pissed at this point and so is my husband. Bartender to the rescue...I walk up there a second time and he looks sheepish. He knows already that the drink he made came to me after knowing full well that I did not want what was obviously given to me. He offered to look in the backroom for a replacement and ended up getting me exactly what I wanted from somewhere else.  Food: we had the mini trio of pot pies for appetizer, delicious, came out quick, but a little pricey for what you get. Prime rib entree also very good, nice cut, well cooked. Caesar salad, simply delicious, homemade dressing with anchovies, yum! Grilled lamb burger on the brioche bun, soooo good, I loved it!   Its so sad that an experience like we had could overshadow really good food. The food is served well, its creative, eye appealing and tastes great. The service is poor, the hostess stand awful,  stacked with 2-3 girls who don't use any common sense,  and are phony to greet but yet don't even notice as you leave after spending $250.  It all left a bad taste in our mouths.  This is vegas, and there are so many restaurants to choose from...We will not be back.  Well, maybe we will sit at the bar :)",

You can sit in the back if you want to escape the casino, or sit by the Bar in a high top if you want to still be a part of the casino.  I'm 6-3 so we opted for a high top.  Service was excellent- very attentive.  We had the Hellfire wings and split a burger.  Wings were very good- loved the sauce.  The burger was good as well.  Temp was wrong so they corrected and comp'd a dessert- sticky toffee, which the wife loved.  3 beers a Moscow mule, wings and a burger -$96.  Do I like the place, yes.  Do I feel it's overpriced- yes.   Yes I know your paying for the location and name.  Still felt like the bill should have been $60-70.  Pice dropped it from 4 stars to 3.

We got table touches from table touches from two managers Louie and Randy who both seemed to be very much on top things in the dining room. Will be coming back for a full meal soon for sure!",

    "text": "My husband and I came to Las Vegas on our honeymoon. Being from Sonoma County, we are surrounded by delicious food. My husband and I both love watching all of Gordon Ramsay's shows so when we stumbled across his Pub and Grill at Caesar's Palace, we knew we had to give it a try. The hostess sat us in a lovely cozy booth and the ambiance was on point. Our server was David S. Gordon Ramsay is very lucky to have such an amazing and talented server such as David, working for him. My husband and I come from the restaurant industry and so we know the importance of good service and David is what all servers should strive to be. He was welcoming and professional and extremely knowledgeable. He showed us his picture of him with Gordon because my husband and I were very curious about the \"real\" Ramsay compared to what you see on television on HK. David had nothing but raving reviews about Gordon. Next we looked over the menu and couldn't decide what to order since it all looked so good. We decided to try the happy hour menu so that we could taste multiple items. Excellent prices as well! We ordered the kettle chip nachos, wings, truffle fries, and burger.  Everything we ordered was exactly what you'd expect to get from Gordon Ramsay. The nachos were to die for. Kettle chips and tender meats with the most velvety cheese sauce was like an explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth. The truffle fries come with the most addicting dipping sauce. Garlic fries don't stand a chance to these fries! My husband loves wings but I do not, that was until I tried these. WOW!!!! Just goes to prove that quality of food is truly key to successful dishes. We wanted happy hour cocktails but didn't know what to order so David recommend the Goodbye Blue Sky and The Pub Crawl. Perfectly pairs with our dishes. To make this experience even more fabulous and memorable, David presented us with it only one, but two, amazing desserts to help us celebrate our honeymoon. This was the first and only time during our stay in Vegas that we truly felt special regarding our honeymoon! We asked David about other spectacular activities to do while in Vegas and he had many suggestions. Everything we asked him about the food we ate and the restaurant, David had a very insightful response/answer. Mr. Ramsay, your server David is a delight and treasure to your restaurant. We will be back yearly and although David may not still be there, we will eat there every time! Thank you!",

The staff was attentive and our waitress was on top of things. It was crowded but we were never made to feel rushed. We asked our waitress what her favorite side was and she suggested the Brussels sprouts... I know?!?!? They were amazing! The hubby and I didn't want to share. I would definitely recommend reservations because you don't have to wait in line for a table. It's a must for a celebrity food fan!",

I was really surprised when they came to our table because it looks like 6 large, fatty fries stacked on top of each other. When I picked up the first one I was so surprised by its weight that I almost dropped it... Apparently the fries are boiled, baked, then fried to give it a great consistency!  They're still working on smoothing out the service and everything since they just opened not too long ago. We were initially seated at a table with basically no lighting. Other than that, I had a great experience with the boyfriend.",

I got banggers and mash which came with various flavors of banggers and I didn't care for that one of them was pretty gross, my daughter wouldn't even eat it and she's not picky at all when it comes to that type of food normally. My potatoes were good so I ate those, I also had some little sausage appetizer that wasn't great either. My husband liked his lobster roll and I'll admit his steak was much better then my food. We did get the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was really good. So Id' get that again. Over all I was disappointed and would skip this place to try other foods Vegas has to offer. It was also pretty loud and we had so many people bringing food or drinks I'm not even sure who our server was. It was kind of late and we were too hungry to wait for Creaser's buffet. I'd wait next time.",

I had the short rib cheese steak, this is the first time I had short ribs prepared like a cheese steak.  It was original and delicious.  The short rib was perfectly seasoned and had a horseradish sauce while delicious, it made the sandwich a little spicy.  The caramelized onions and red peppers complemented the dish.  The fries were prepared as small wedges and baked, topped with parmesan cheese, this was such a simple but delicious concept!  Be warned before you eat here you are going to pay. While the prices are high the food quality is defiantly worth it.  If you stay away from alcohol your average price per person will run between $15-30 for lunch.  The only thing stopping me from a 5 star rating was the stow service.",

The fish and chips used to be awesome. Not anymore. Instead of large pieces of tender fish in a delicious batter, now you get a skinny flavorless greasy piece of fish. My expensive braised short rib tasted like bland pot-roast and there is no salt and pepper readily available. Our server was just okay and we like to tip well for good service. Not this time. And we wanted the manager to know we were disappointed and he didn't really seem to care. Getting offered a free dessert is not the solution (and we didn't take the offer). We said the solution is to let Gordon Ramsey know. Mr. Ramsey, you may not be aware that your menu has changed. but you should because there  are too many other options for dining in Las Vegas.",

My girl and I are at Caesars looking for a bite and I decided on Ramsey's pub n grill so we stood at the hostess desk for a good fee minutes before we were even spoken to by one of the 3 girls in miniskirts that were talking to eachother. Then we are taken to a seat in the bar area next to all the kegs that were used as the divider for the bar area and the seating area. We were not asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, my girl always will prefer a booth but we were not given that option.  We were seated and left alone for about 5min before I had to flag down a busser to ask for a menu. Looking at the menu for about 5-10 more minutes we were never approached by another employee at all. We were not offered water or drinks or asked if we were ready to order. Now considering the fact that by the time we each have a meal and a drink we were looking to spend close to $100 for burgers we elected to just get up and walk out. As far as the food goes I have actually eaten wings and a burger from here while playing poker in Caesars poker room and it is pretty good food from what I have seen. Having said that I cannot say the same for their service in my particular case. I'm sorry with me you only get one shot at my business I really see no reason to go back after my initial experience. I would rather go to Bachi Burger by my house and only spend $40-$50 for an even better quality meal that you will get here.   Sorry Gordon I just call them the way I see them , from watching all your shows I was honestly shocked by the service we encountered. End Rant!!",

Shepard's Pie was bland and about half way though butcher paper was found nestled in  with the plain mash potatoes which topped this wreck.    Stick to beer and fish sticks. You would be better off with that.   They really don't do much well for the price.",

At the time we were in Planet Hollywood so decided to go to BURGR but the line was (--------------------- *now maximize by x100) that long, so I made a reservation for Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill instead. We got there probably 5 mins late due to not being all to cross the street in Vegas (damn escalators everywhere.) When we walked up to the hostess she asked for reservation and said that everything was fine/table was still available. Sat down, greeted by a very nice waiter, made small talk, oversell good enough guy! As an appetizer we shared an order of truffle fries and the were excellent, seasoned very well/ not over powered by the truffle oil like most places do. On to the entrees: GF- Lobster/shrimp roll - she loved it, roll was nice, not soggy at all, Lobster was perfect. Mine- pulled pork sandwich - the bread was VERY greasy which I wasn't expecting, the pork was slightly dry, apple slaw was nice.  Overall , I believe 3 stars is fair. I would still like to try BrGR and Gordon Ramsey Steak! Black jacket? Wonder if Chef Scott was running the pass or Latasha(oh)",

I ended up with a delicious pasta with veggies that had a sour flavor, but was really good. The artichokes and olives complimented the flavor well, and it only ended up being $14! My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie, which she really enjoyed. For dessert, we went with the famous toffee pudding, which did not disappoint.

Maybe a tad overpriced but to be expected for Vegas. The drinks here are pretty good too...we got the mocha martini, two Belgian margaritas and a wheat beer. All of us were happy with the drinks. Though we all agreed the dessert was our favorite thing :)",

Here is where they failed.... - seated late for our reservation (large group of 16) - staff could have been friendlier  - The washrooms were gross (a reflection on what the kitchen looks like?) - the food was mediocre, disappointed and expected better! - one burger order came out raw - the waiter got the order wrong then tried to place blame on the 2 people which ordered - they had to wait 25 mins for the right order while the rest of us ate our food. The food came once everyone else was done eating.(was told it would be 7 mins) - was told bills could not be separated...they had to do a minimum of 4 cheques- despite our telling 3 servers how to separate the 4 bills at the start of our meal it didn't happen. We had to wait for an additional 30 mins for the bill to be separated...we also had to calculate taxes and gratuity ourselves.  - the entire experience was a 3 hour ordeal which is much too long when u want to get out and experience Vegas!!   The good points... - sticky toffee pudding!!  - truffle fries",

More often than not, I end up eating alone at the bar to try to find some measure of friendly conversation.   Now, good drinks and food are just the minimum. I expect that.  But I really want the bartender to act like I am his long lost best friend.  Enter Ray Ray, the afternoon bartender at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill.  I was not only happy to be there, I hated to leave.  Ray Ray introduced me to new beers, and was not short of fun conversation.  Not to be outdone by Ray Ray, the bar manager Randy came by to personally make sure I was happy.  And he also spent time getting to know me.  The drinks ( I had the 'God Save the Queen') and food (Fish and Chips) were outstanding.  If you plan to attend, it is indeed pub food.  They have a couple high end dishes. But this is the place you can come if you don't feel like changing out of your jeans or shorts.    There is no shortage of unique eateries in Vegas.  Heck, there are a dozen under one roof.  But if you want someone who REALLY cares about you having a good time, head to Gordon's Pub and Grill at Caesars.",

I ordered the fish and chips as an entree, and the table ordered the pretzels with cheese dip, deviled eggs, and sliders to share. I got to try every appetizer, and they were all delicious. Except the cheese was a little gritty. I like my cheese sauce smoother... but the flavor was pretty good.  My fish and chips were so good! Well, mostly the fish because the chips were big, fat potato pieces that are fried... pan fried? Haha I'm not a big fan of thick fries, I like them a little thinner and crispier. But the fish was flaky, crispy, moist, and fresh af. MMMMmmm and my bf ordered the pork belly.... omg............. It was SOO delicious. It's very rich, fatty, melty in your mouthy, and maybe a little too salty but overall it was really bomb. I don't think I could finish one by myself, so I'm glad I got to try his :)  DESSERT: Sticky toffee pudding - ORDER IT! It's soooo decadent, warm, caramel-y, gooey, and sticky, and topped with ice cream = heaven.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I are foodies, and we came to Las Vegas for the shows, and the food.  We had a list of \"chef signature\" places we wanted to visit.  Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill was actually an accident because one of our other places was a bust.  The Experience: We came around 2pm for a late lunch and were seated right away.  The experience here started off a bit rocky since our waitress never came, but once we asked the manager what was going on, we were seated at a different table with a very friendly waitress (her name was Bridgette I believe).  The manager (his name was Derek) was extremely apologetic and checked on us often through the duration of our meal.  He even offered to comp our appetizer, which was a really nice touch, and alleviated any possible hostility that we might have had.  Derek was probably the highlight of our experience since he was so accommodating and warm.  He truly went above and beyond for us.  Thank you Derek!  The Food: Both my boyfriend and I had the lobster rolls, shared a chicken caesar salad, and lastly the toffee pudding.  Lobster rolls:  Great portions, but lacked a little flavor.  I expected a bit more or maybe something different, but still delicious.  Chicken Cesar: Comes on large leaves of lettuce, but generous portions of chicken, and the dressing was phenom.  Very delicious.  Toffee Pudding: We bought it per recommendation from Derek...it was incredibly delicious.  Im not a super fan of caramel, and even I demolished this thing.  It was perfection.  The caramel is served warm and you pour it on top....YUM!!  All in all...wonderful..and we will be back! :)  Thank you Bridgette and Derek!",

    "text": "I have watched chef Ramsey quite a bit, and have gotten the impression that all his red-faced histrionics are just his way of \"taking the piss\" as a brit might say. Certainly he has become quite the star by informing chefs and restauranteurs in no uncertain terms why their food or dining establishment falls short of his professed high standards. So naturally on a recent visit to caesers I felt drawn to his namesake pub, to see how it was living up to those standards.  I must sadly report that it fell way short. We were there for a happy hour so got to sample a variety of items, and not one of them was in any way noteworthy. I recall a dry as bones slider, a pastry wrapped \"toad in the hole\" sausage that can be best described as insipid, some very ordinary \"chips,\" or fries as we deem them west of the pond, and a few items than even now, just a few days later, have already faded from my gastro memory.  Perhaps an earlier yelper was correct in stating that Ramsay himself should get in here and start yelling at people, but until he does I suggest you limit your patronage here to a couple of pints.",

The waitress led us to a table that was ridiculously too small and you had to sit on stools, so there was no place to put your jacket or purse. I immediately asked her if we could be seated at a bigger table but she said that they had a limited waitstaff because they were closing in 45 minutes. OK, fine, I figured I could make it work. But no, the table was just way too small. I wish I had taken a picture of it because it was half the size of the other tables around us.  Our waiter, Chris, came by and introduced himself to us. I asked him right away if there's anything he could do about our table situation. He said he would have to ask the hostess. He came back right away and said we could move to a bigger table. THANK YOU, CHRIS!!!  BTW, the area where we were seated was kinda dark but I was happy for a bigger table.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Shepard's Pie. He really enjoyed his but I thought it was kinda bland. It did not have much taste to it at all. I've only had Shepard's Pie once before years ago and I remembered it being flavorful. Usually we don't order the same things but for some reason on this night we did. I should have ordered the fish and chips.",

Some things are definitely worth the price.  -- SERVICE -- Our waitress was very friendly. She had a lot of conversations with us. She came and checked in on us on a regular. Oh and did I mention she is also very cute. They only thing I think they can improve on is getting water to the customers ASAP. We waited about 10 minutes or so before we got menus and water.   -- OVERALL -- Definitely still a fan of Gordan's!! Will definitely come back =)",

I ordered the Dublin sandwich with no sauerkraut. Daisy suggested I leave it on, said to trust her. So glad I did. The sandwich was amazing! The fries were just plain and basic, nothing exciting there.  I will definitely be back, and hope to have Daisy again!",

We had the chicken wing appetizer, a cheeseburger, and a corned beef sandwich. YUM! Only flaw I would say is the waiter. Noticed him giving more attention to other tables and then would take forever to come back to us. Didn't quite appreciate that. Also, this restaurant did not have ranch or BBQ sauce. Otherwise, the food was amazing. I plan to return in the future.",

He should really yell at himself.   Seervice: Staff were friendly but not stellar. They were more focused on trying to push more items to sell. We had five in our party and took over an hour to get our food. Granted, it was 8pm on Saturday night, food came really slow.  Food: We orderes fish & chips, corned beef brisket sandwich, burger, scotch eggs, salted pretzels and beer. Servings were huge but everything tasted mediocre at best. We left most of our dishes untouched more than half and didn't bother to take the rest home.   Price: $260 for the five of us and 4 beers.",

The three stars is for the service. The service was nice. However, the food was disappointing. Maybe if I had not experienced Gordon Ramsey's Steak before this establishment, the rating would be better. If you are searching for the Gordon Ramsey VIP experience (awesome service, food, and memories to boot) go to Gordon Ramsey's Steak, instead. The difference is like night and day.   Food here at the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill  is average at best and not worth the price tag.",

I'm glad we ate here...because I have never experienced a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and I wanted to get an idea.  The pro's? The food was AMAZING! Everything we ordered was fantastic. My friend and I had the Fish & Chips, which was really good. I went to College in London for four years, and never had Fish & Chips as awesome as this! My other friends had a pasta dish and a flat iron steak which they also repeatedly commented on how good their meal was.   The Con's? The service was SLOW! We actually got to that point where we asked the server what was taking so long? The only other complain? The price was high...as to be expected I guess...but I've never been one of those guys that thinks a Flat Iron Steak should cost 30 bucks! Especially when it's literally just the steak...no other side.   It was a nice time...but I don't think I would go back unless I really wanted to...which I don't as of now.",

    "text": "In True Las Vegas fashion, my family did Christmas on the Strip starting with dinner at one of the most recent additions to Ramsay's restaurant empire. The good impressions started even before we entered the place. In the first moments of walking up to the restaurant, I fell in love with their uniforms! The hostess' are outfitted in the most adorably sexy newspaper dress accessorized with fingerless leather gloves and matching booties. Someone remind me to ask our loving David S. to steal one for me ;) The uniforms only got better as the rest of the FOH people were dressed in this awesome British punk street wear. Designer Allison Leach of Mad Men and Glee did one heck of a job of creating that awesome first impression.   Our server was a little too high energy for me. You know when you have that fake salesperson vibe when they're trying to sell you something? Yeah, it was a little much. But other then that our server and serving assistants were working like a well-oiled machine. My mother is a lightweight and needed a girly beer. Our server smartly suggested the strawberry Fruli... It is now her favorite beer ever. And bread service was amazing. It shows up warm and delicious with a cheddar cheese spread and whipped butter cream. Andthey don't have a problem with serving you seconds. Hands down the best bread basket in town.    The food. Oh man, the food is British pub action on point. I was itching to try some Sheperd's Pie. And although it is one of the cheapest entree items it was one of the most delicious non-Asian foods I've eaten in forever. Tender chunks of lamb, beef, and vegetables blanketed in mouth-watering mashed potatoes. *heaven* In the fish & chips, they used cod which was a little heavier on the breading but fried to perfection. And the chips (fries) were thick blocks of fried potato served piping hot. Instead of a salad, we ordered a side of Brussels sprouts sauteed with bacon and apples. The slices of apple were real treats! They absorbed all the delicious flavors from the seasoning  and the sugar cooked off in the little bit of bacon fat. Amazing! I wish there were more than just 2!   The only downside to our meal was the lamb riblettes appetizer. Tiny bits of lamb were served with a creamy cumin-based yogurt sauce. It was tasty but for the price, portion size was absolutely abysmal. GR insider David S. says the lamb entree is the way to go and 1000x better.   I'm loving GR's new diggs. It's cool but still upscale with the food & service to match. I shall return.   Cheers!",

We had the beef and ale and the chicken and bacon pies. Both were by far the best pies we have ever had, gourmet meals in fact, and that includes plenty of America  restaurants! All ingredients were fresh and high quality.  We are every scrap. Generally the Strip restaurants ate overpriced but this was fair value. Would definitely return. It's not True British food.

I hated the fact that when our dessert came out and was put on our plate. He took the sauce and wanted to pour it on my dessert. I politely said no thank you. I also noticed he lifted someone else's sauce at the table next to us. It's just a bit weird.  I ordered the mini burger and it was good but nothing special. I saw a lot of people ordering the pretzels so we got those too. They look amazing but they taste like a few days old. Not hot. Not fresh. The cheese sauce also looked like something that had been sitting for days. I mean... who could ruin a pretzel? It's just dough.   Wish I could say my experience was better but I would never go here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are so many better places in Vegas.  I'd really like Gordon Ramsay him self to come in and have a meal. I'm sure he wouldn't be pleased.   And here's my review since my waiter said about 3 times that I should write one.",

Had the shepherds pie and it was nothing to write home about, nothing special at all - plus there was 3-4 in of potatoes on top of filling. Would never order again Service Ate at bar, bartender had a bit of tude when it came to recommendations etc, like he did not want to answer questions  Based on food & tude, would not recommend or likely return",

They have a great beer selection, including some of Ramsay's claimed favorites.  I tried them all a couple times, it was good.  Overall its worth a trip, but you better get reservations in advance or you will be waiting a half hour or more.  Reserve online and you get right in.  Like I said, the service was awesome!",

    "text": "We stopped by here last weekend around 4pm for Lunch to a medium sized crowd dining while watching football.  We didn't have reservations although they take them and were sat in 10 minutes.  We had the luxury of being seated at a low standing coffee table w/ two king chairs on one side and a huge sofa on the other.  Since our party consisted of me, my wife, my 6 month old and our 3 year old, the seating was perfect.  Our waitress came by within 2 minutes of us being sat to take our drink order.  For a gastropub, the \"hard stuff\" concoctions were a little limited (about 10 to choose from - zero tequila based beverages) as the majority of their libations are Beers.  Not a bad thing for a gastropub, but I like having variety open.  We ordered a very tasty Bourbon drink that immediately put a smile on my wife's face and I ordered a Rum concoction that tasted like a Watermelon Cooler.  To start we ordered the \"Chilled Shrimp Salad\" - poached in lemon-beer shandy, light ginger-mayo, w/ red cocktail sauce.  It came out in about 8 minutes and my 3 year old couldn't stop eating \"his shrimpys\".   Very good dish. For our entrees, I ordered the Traditional Shepherd's Pie and the Beef Short-Rib & Cheek sandwhich - on hearth baked sourdough, horseradish mayo, roasted red pepper jam, red onion marmalade.  The Beef Short Rib was one of the best sandwich's i've had.  Dipping it into the horeseradish infused ketchup made all the difference too.  Couldn't get enough of this flavor bomb.  The Shepherd's Pie was also very good, but too traditional.  I would have preferred more gravy and less potatoes.  It was VERY traditional.  Not a bad thing, just hoped he would have kicked it up a notch.  Overall, the meal came out to $100 w/ the two drinks ($30) so overall, medium priced for a Casino meal and would go back.",

I found the food to be pretty crappy. Not good flavor profiles at all. All my food was even bland at times. I tried nearly everything that our table of 6 got. Nothing really wowed me.  The service was slow. Not very attentive.  There were 2 positive notes. The sticky toffee pudding (which is one of my favs) was really excellent. I would go back only for desert just for that. I also like the sound track of British music playing.  Aside from that, I think Mr. Ramsey should take a page from some of his own TV shows and go in there and cuss people out for failing to run a good restaurant.  Whoever is in charge there needs a good yelling at.",

The Lamb was over cooked. It took the server more than 10 minutes after we got our food to ask how the food was.  I told him that I asked for the burger to be med well and it was more than well done.  He said well med well is some pink and it barely past that stage. I said there should be pink for med well and red for med. He offered to get me a new one but we had plans to be somewhere with friends.  The manager or supervisor past is more than 8 times and never acknowledged us and never said hi. He would spend more time with the girls that worked there talking and laughing by the table then supervising. We got our total bill and he never apologized when giving us the bill or fortune our payment. We still tipped him 15%  for someone who has worked in hotels and has managed a restaurant I know i can be critical but bad service is something I don't deal well with.  I watch Gordon Ramsey show all the time and I admire what he does but I don't think he would be very happy with the strive provided here. The lamb was over cooked and had no flavor.  Well. It actually tasted very lamby if that's a work. Lol.  I expected so much more from this restaurant.  We were going to order dessert and shots of tequila but after my experience I did not want to give this restaurant more business.",

Fish & Chips; thick soggy batter with white mush inside for fish and Zero flavor.  The chips big huge block like sticks of greasy mush potato.  Brook Trout; a slab of fish with no flavor and root vegetables that tasted just like dirt.  So ok maybe the chef had a bad night, like he forgot his seasoning apron.  I could see a off night, but I can't  see horrible service.  Not in Vegas where ever casino has at least three great restaurant and five or so ok ones.  Our waitress or lack of one was awful she literally was never there.  I had to grab someone walking by every time we needed any thing drinks, bread, our order, and check.  Ok all that and a bus boy that spilled twice all over the table.  First time pouring water, he just kept pouring even after he had left the glass.  Second time picking up our plates, spilling what ever buttery watery juice came with the trout all over the table and my iPhone.  Each time he did this he never apologized or said a word.   Guess I can say, just don't go.  Go anywhere else, there are so many options",

After we walked in and saw the mural on the back wall we only expected greatness as I am a fan.    The waiter greeted us with most friendlyness it almost seemed like we had met before and were long time friends.  He proceeded to explain the menu and make recommendations.  We took his advise on a couple of dishes and boy, oh boy..... We are hooked!   Everything we had was delicious.   The portions are small so no sharing is advised. Another word of advise for the restaurant manager and the lady patrons that walk in with heels.... Hold on to a rail for dear life.  I almost fell three times on my way to our table.  At first I thought it was my shoes but after witnessing 2 lady guest fall in front of my table at different times while we had dinner, there was no doubt in my mind.... The floors are slippery and very dangerous specially after a couple of fancy cocktails. You have been advised!!! :)",

    "text": "Dear Gordon,  This was my first trip to this 'restaurant' of yours. May I say if I wanted to feel like I wanted to be in one of your 'Kitchen Nightmare' shows this was it - at your very own restaurant. !! I am very disappointed Gordon.   Arriving Thursday evening, four front of house lady restaurant hosts in their tight fitting 'London' dresses (just to remind you you were entering the land of british cuisine) sparring over seating arrangements on their seating/reservation computer made for great amusement as the restaurant waiting line grew.   Eventually getting to the front we asked whether we wanted to sit on the low tables or higher tables - we indicated lower. A few minutes later one of the other hosts took us to our higher table - we told her of what we had asked for - she seemed confused - however we told her we'd stay at the table she'd taken us to - communication a problem here ?    After five to ten minutes waiting our waiter Ali D came along. A young chap who told me he had been educated at a college in Birmingham, UK and had attended business school but had come back to the States to waiter because the money was better 'waitering'. Taking my order of Shepard's Pie and a pint of Fullers he promply disappeared. Twenty five minutes passed and then the Shepard's Pie turned up.  Ali still no where in sight with the beer. The bowls for the Shepard's Pie are circa 7\" are smaller than what you think, however quality over quantity here as you are paying $23 for a tasting experience Ramsay style.  Asking this waiter about my drink - he promptly left and ten minutes later Ali turned up with the drink ! yeah ! - only 40 minutes to get a drink. !!   Quality of the Shepard's Pie - packed with lamb and vegetables , it was not extraordinary in anyway , however what let it down considerably was the mash potato topping which was watery, singing to the fact this thing had just been microwaved - either that, or Gordon's mum had trained Gordon to make mashed potatoes this way - I think not.     After finishing this and waiting another ten minutes for Ali to come back, I decided to be brave and order the Sticky Toffee pudding. At this point , I had a further surprise - a bread basket appeared !! another first for me - isn't this suppose to appear at the start of the meal ?   Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes , boy how long does it take to make this dessert ? Ali passed  us a number of times and no comment from him. Eventually I flagged down another waiter and told him I was 'pissed' and wanted to see my waiter. A few minutes later Ali turned up, telling him promply to cancel the dessert offering and get me the bill. No apologies or anything, he left the table. Bringing us the bill for, you've got it, for $122.00 !!! - instead of $32 - way to go Ali !! .    At this juncture, I think one of the other waiters must have summoned the attention of the evening manager Brian Ward. Brian was exemplary in apologizing for the level of service I had received and invited me back to experience the restaurant one more time as I had a couple more days in town. He gave me his card and I thanked him for coming over to make amends.    Unfortunately Gordon, there are many other places in Vegas to eat and this is one restaurant of yours I shall not be returning to. This place is a disaster and I'd strongly urge you Gordon to get on the next flight here to shake things up as this restaurant could be on the road to no where sooner than what you think. Sorry to give you this news, but as a fellow Brit - I have to be honest.  If you want me to show your Chef there how to make Shepard's Pie - I'll gladly take the F Word challenge against him/her and see who wins.",

    "text": "Do not eat here. This place is super overrated. Maybe Gordon Ramsey himself is overrated. Two people in our party ordered lamb burgers. My friend ordered his medium, no tomatoes. He received a very well-done burger w/tomatoes. I ordered a med/ rare burger, I received a very well-done burger. We told the waiter about it right away. He asked if he should take it back to the kitchen and we said no, because it was 5pm, our first meal of the day, and we were starving. We just wanted to point it out to him.   You get 4 big steak fries with your burger. One of mine was half uncooked and the other was cold. We told the waiter again and he scoffed at us like we were complaining to get a free meal. He basically made it seem that if the meal was that terrible we shouldn't have ate most of our meals. Come on, we are staying at the Caesar's Palace and ordering $15 dollar cocktails with lunch, you jerk, we are not that cheap.   He did end up taking a $9 dollar appetizer off the meal but was clearly annoyed about it. He even made a big scene about the frozen fry by stabbing my steak knife into the frozen fry and carrying it across the restaurant that way, to the manager, to explain what happened. We tipped him well for taking the app off the meal but we all made it a point to discourage everyone we knew from eating at this place.",

I ordered the Chicken Pot pie and OH MY GOODNESS! Flakey and not overcooked. The gravy was perfect. The veggies and chicken were moist and perfectly made. The wine selection offered was perfect.  My hubby had the burger and really enjoyed it with homemade chips. I would go back in a minute!  Did not disappoint.",

    "text": "Very disappointed for a Gordan Ramsay restaurant. Worst service I've encountered in a long time and I could have ate better food at a bar. First off there was 5 of us and the hostess said 30 minutes. 15 minutes later I went up and told her it will only be 4 people now so she said ok it will be 20 minutes more. My other friend came up to her at the 20 minute mark and said are we next it's 4 people and she said oh it's only 4 people okay give us 10 minutes. Finally, we got sat to a 7 top table and we said there's only 4 of us and she said oh opps sorry and we asked for a smaller table so we could actually communicate instead of yelling across from each other at the table. We ordered are appetizers and we got everything but our pretzels. It took 20 minutes for them to send out the pretzels. We ordered alcohol and one of the beers was not what we ordered and we wanted chilled glasses. It took another 20 minutes to get it and glasses weren't chilled. 45 minutes later we get our entrees and their luke warm not hot. I've never had such bad service of such plain jane food. Our server seemed lost but he was nice and actually admitted that he didn't provide great service but I give him credit for being honest. The only positive is the manager comped our meal and that was very kind of her. Hopefully they will work out the tweaks and maybe I will return since I do enjoy Gordan Ramsay steak at Paris.  PROS: Price, service, unorganized, food, communication CONS: Ambiance, decor, cocktails",

The service and hospitality was impeccable, which certainly added to the quality of the food and drink experience. Our servers, Adam (on 3/7) and Sara (on 3/11), were terrific. On our first visit the bar manager, Randy, also came over and introduced himself. He was very personable and we shared some laughs as Norma and Sherry related how they had met Gordon Ramsay a couple of years ago.  The calamari with bacon crackle was simply one of the best we have ever had. My wife fell in love with the fish & chips (great batter!) and my NY strip steak was exactly medium rare. Every dish was one of the best we have ever had. But the kudos do not end there -  Sherry's Cosmopolitan and Norma's blueberry & blackberry concoction were delicious and my bourbon cocktail was literally PERFECT and the best outside of my own! It was wonderful to not have to explain how to mix a Perfect Manhattan. As Randy explained, all the bartenders have won contests. Well...it showed. Randy also steered us to two wonderful desserts, sticky toffee pudding and snickerdoodle madeleine.   We also got to meet Scott Cummings, the winner of Season 12 Hell's Kitchen. We were happy to have the opportunity to tell him how much we loved all the food!  Needless to say, we loved it so much the first time that's why we came back for a second visit in the same week!! We will be sure to try Gordon Ramsay's other places as his brand is as good as his name!",

Our server is fantastic, very nice, recommended sliders, pork belly, and steak, so we go ahead ordered those. Now I clocked the time, we waited 30mins for food to come out, very slow. Our server keep checking on us and reassured us about our food which is very nice of her.   When our food is served, nothing is really good. Sliders were dry, pork belly was decent but not great. Now the steak, that was way over cooked, seasoning is way too salty, to a point you can't even taste anything but saltiness. We ask our server to come take a look, she instantly apologize and told us she will speak to her boss to see if it can be take off the bill. and it was taken off the bill, which is about $40. We didn't ordered any replacement course cos we scare to wait another 30mins...   At the end the whole dinning experience is a disappointment, that fact that food came out of Ramsay's kitchen is so sub par, here I will use his fav phase Dreadful!!! If wasn't for Ramsay's name..it will be a 1 star review, seriously!!",

Call me weird but I had my heart set on a burger.  I heard they were the best in Vegas and if Chef Ramsay's name is on it... I just have to believe it's True.  Guess what kids?  It was the best damn burger I've ever tasted.  Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and on a fresh homemade bun.  I added the truffle fries and I was in Heaven.   One thing that really impressed us was the guys walking around refilling your water.  It was like an art how they twirled the water into the glass not missing a drop.  I loved this place and I loved the atmosphere.  My one and only complaint was the price on the beers.  $11 for a 20oz beer including Miller Light?  Yowza... Someone is banking on those kegs.  I get it.  Ramsay's name is on the place, the service is killer amazing and the food is out of this world amazing.  They can charge whatever they want for cheap beer.  Listen folks, if you are in Vegas, GO HERE.  You will not be disappointed and you will dream for months about sticky toffee pudding.",

    "text": "We are enthusiastic Ramsay fans and finally got a chance to try the Pub & Grill. The first thing that struck me was how comically low the chairs are compared to the tables. My husband is 6-feet tall, and the table top lined up with his chest. I'm 5'1\" so you can imagine that I simply had to slide the food in a straight line directly from the plate to my mouth.   We started with the Ramsay Tonic & a Moscow Mule. Both were just okay. My Moscow Mule tasted mostly of lime, and my husband didn't even finish his drink. The calamari was also just okay. It wasn't crispy, almost chewy, although it was seasoned well. And they served it with tartar sauce and ketchup. Ketchup...?   Husband ordered the Fish & Chips, and I got the Braised Short Rib. The chips (or wedge fries) that came with his were seriously under-seasoned and slightly under-cooked. My Short Rib was the highlight--it nearly melted apart before my fork even touched it. The potato puree was tasty & smooth. Small sad face: the three carrots were still raw. Then came the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We've been obsessed with it ever since our first visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. This one tasted great, but it didn't have the same sticky consistency I love about the one you can get at Steak. This was more like a cake.  The least desirable part of the whole experience was the service. The hostess was cold and didn't even look at me. However, the hostess assistant that sat us was friendly and engaging. Our server was fine but insincere. When he came to take our entree order, he just approached the table and stood there looking at us expectantly. I had to say, \"I think we're ready to order,\" just to break the awkward silence. Again, he was fine; I wouldn't classify it as rude. Just not attentive or warm.  Overall, we had a decent experience. Looking back, I would rather have spent our 7-year anniversary and hard earned money at Steak again because the pricing is nearly the same, and the experience at Steak is significantly better.",

Cool mix of tables and sofas and loveseats. HUGE bar. We chose to sit at the bar (being the alcoholics we are) and the happy hour was kick ass. Probably 20 different beers and ciders. Prices on beers and appetizers were so affordable. The nachos here - oh my word - just try them. My boyfriend got them while I attempted a healthier option. Pretty sure I scarfed all his nachos when he got up to use the restroom. Talk about order regret.  The best part of our visit here was the bartender Ray Ray.  He's off on weekends, but if you are nearby during a weekday, look for a big friendly bartender named Ray. He anticipated our needs ahead of time, was personable and professional, and has years and years of experience in the service industry in Vegas. Would have loved to kick it at the bar with him all day.  He was equally as friendly and helpful with the other patrons at the bar as well.",

Service was pretty bad too, we waited close to 20 min for him to even look down our way, and at the end I just grabbed random worker and asked him to get us a check.  They r getting 2 stars because the wings were A \"ok\".",

The pretzel appetizer was pretty good but for 7$ it would be nice to get more than 3.  The english cheddar sauce that is served with the pretzels is amazing though.    The Beer Braised Short Rib entree is fantastic however a little steep at almost 40$.  The portion size was generous.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a must have.",

I ate half and wanted to take the rest to go. While pouring my fries into my to go container a half an inch of oil came out and ruined what was left of my burger and the fries were so saturated with oil it was inedible.   I tell mgt and they agreed to reduce my bill from 30 to 26. As I didn't get to eat most of my meal I thought it was a bit cheap and dismissive. For that price for a burger it should blow my mind.  Help staff was great though.   For the price I would pass if I were you.",

Still a 3 star restaurant but the only reason for me to go back is gone now...  On the whole, this place is about 3 stars... the fish and chips however are 5 stars!     I got the fish and chips which were AMAZING.  The batter was perfect and the fish was fried perfectly.   The fries were medium sized and also delicious.  We also got the scotch egg, bangers and mash, and sheperds pie at our table.  All of which were average (3 stars).  Their beer selection is actually pretty weak although they did have Innis and Gunn on tap which is an amazing beer.   This being Vegas,  there are much cheaper places to drink so I would suggest just getting the 1 beer to go with your meal.     Prices were 9-13 dollars for largely mainstream and uninteresting beers.",

I had the bacon cheddar burger which was $25 and was very average at best. I think Gordon needs to take some of his own advice and re-evaluate his menu at this place because it in not very impressive to say the least.",

I'm glad to see what regardless of where in the world it is, his restaurants live up to certain quality standards.   We dropped in without a reservation while wandering through Caesar's.  I had the Mule's Hind Leg cocktail and it was pretty good, though just par for the course for a Vegas cocktail.  But the food really shined, especially for the price (relative to Vegas anyway).  I had the fish and chips and while the chips were nothing to write home about the fish was maybe the best fish and chips I've had anywhere in the U.S.  It was lightly breaded with nice chunks of white fish.  My friend had the steak and ale pie and really enjoyed it.  Through Yelp we got the sticky toffee pudding and it was a nice way to end the meal.

When they mentioned that Beef Wellington was their special and that they only serve it about 10 times a year, I decided to order it knowing it's one of Gordon Ramsay's signature dishes.  Time passed. More time passed. After 1 hour, 20 mins we asked where our food was. The server finally went to see and they came out with our food a while later. Come to find out later, they lost the ticket for our table and had to rush an order. Beef wellington typically takes 30-60 mins to make. The right thing for them to do would have been to come out and tell us what happened and ask if we wanted to wait for another hour for them to make it properly or give us the option of ordering something else. Did they do that? No. Instead, they rushed the order and overcooked the Beef Wellington. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it. It didn't have much flavor and it was really disappointing. Even the mashed potatoes was luke warm.  They ended up giving us 20% off and the manager came out and apologized. It wasn't enough to make up for it though.  I'd like to think if Gordon Ramsay himself had been in the kitchen and see the mess, he would have screamed \"SHUT IT DOWN!\".",

The grandkids had fun interacting with Afro as well.  The pesto chicken sandwich was moist and tasty.  Wings, sliders, and lobster roll were top notch as well. Scott the winning chef was in the kitchen that day and he was gracious with photos.  We tried various alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages suggested by Afro and were not disappointed.

    "text": "We decided to try this place for lunch on a Saturday while we were in town for the weekend since we ate at BurgR last visit and really liked the food. Surprisingly, at 1:30 PM on a Saturday, we were seated right away without a wait. The prices for lunch were a little startling - $27 for Fish and Chips! It didn't take too long for our lunch to leave a bad taste in our mouth due to the horrible service we received. We were a party of 5: Two ordered the Fish & Chips, 1 ordered a Caesar Salad, 1 ordered the sliders and 1 ordered a burger.   1 order of Fish & Chips arrived within a normal waiting time. Then we waited, and waited for the rest of our party to receive our lunch orders. We insisted to our friend that he shouldn't wait for our food so his was not cold, so he ate. We waited. 40 minutes AFTER his order arrived, we received our lunch! Our server did come by twice to let us know \"she was sorry about that\" but that the kitchen cooked his first (because it's really fast), but that didn't really explain why only 1 order of Fish & Chips came out first and why it took an additional 40 minutes for the rest of the food.  By the time the rest of us ate our very mediocre, over-priced food, we were pretty much done with the place. We had to ask for our bill twice, and when we received our check, we noticed that we did not receive the \"Total Rewards\" card discount printed on the menu for all of our food items as there was only a $1 reduction in price of bill.  Upon asking our server about the discrepancy, she stated that she had \"nothing to do with it\" and the cashier swipes the card and all eligible discounts are applied. \"So, the prices printed on the menu are False?\" I told her that every single item we ordered had two prices; a \"regular price\" and a \"Total Rewards\" price. She shrugged her shoulders and said, \"well, I don't know.\"  So I asked her for a menu so I could compare what the difference was. She never brought me a menu and instead, avoided any contact with our table (she clearly had dismissed us). So I found a menu by myself and upon review, we could clearly see that we were overcharged $12.00.  I went up to the bar and asked for a manager to come to our table. The manager came by after about 10 minutes and was a dick about the whole thing. Sorry about your lunch coming late . . . blah, blah, blah, I don't really give a crap, blah, blah, blah, I'll \"do you a favor\" and adjust your bill, \"blah, blah, blah.\" The reality is that he had them remove an $8.00 item (deviled eggs), which still wasn't reflective of what we should be discounted, so frankly, we just paid our bill and left.  This was probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.",

Ok, so I asked for the pear cider...nope. They were out of that too. My lunch was pretty bad. I ordered the lamb burger, and when it came out, the bottom bun was already bloody and soggy...inedible. Yuck! I was actually surprised they had the nerve to bring it out to me. I tried to eat the rest of the burger and the meat was almost too gamey to eat. I know some lamb meat has that flavor characteristic, but this was bad. I've had a good lamb burger before and I can assure you this isn't it. All negatives put aside, my wife ordered the \"spotted dic\" desert and that was about the best desert either of us have ever tasted before. I recommend this place for that and maybe some cider if they aren't out. Stay away from the lamb burger, though. Ughh...",

Everything was fine, it just wasn't what it was cracked up to be. Our server was funny for the most part, but questionable at times too.  I got the NY strip and it came out cooked to my liking. The truffle chips (aka fries) were the real mvps here, but it didn't seem like they were cooked in house or anything. The creamed spinach was excellent, we liked the breadcrumbs on top. We also got the mushrooms without the egg, but they were nothing special.",

Sitting at the bar is always nice because there's rarely a wait and the bartenders are friendly and like to chat when they have time.  This time around we also ordered the lobster mac & cheese. It's $14 more than a regular Mac & cheese, but only had two little pieces of lobster inside. It was a bit disappointing and not worth the price.  However, they were nice enough to bring us out another order when we said something...  and it was loaded! Overall, we've always had a pleasant experience here. Check it out!  Oh, and get a Guinness too!",

    "text": "(This review is solely based on their HH as I've yet to eat a proper meal here)  Hot damn this is one of the better HH deals you'll find on the strip and throw in the fact it's at Ceasar's makes it that much better. The slots may be tight but you'll feel like a King walking away without burning a hole in your wallet.  Their HH is valid between Monday-Friday and the range of hours is pretty decent honestly. I can't recall the exact hours because I was drinking but I know we had more than enough time to enjoy it properly.  Some of the bar food items you could enjoy were their signature wings, mini corn dogs, pretzel sticks, truffle fries, mini sliders, and about 2 other food items. As for the drinks you could choose from a few beers/wines/cocktails.  My family was all over the wings, mini corn dogs and fries. For my personal taste the truffle fries were stronger on the truffle fries but damn they were delicious. I'm certain my Mom was obsessed with them everytime we had to take a new order for the table. What's great about the HH menu is the food items range from $5-$7 a pop. (Crazy I know). The pretzel sticks weren't the freshest but s*&$ for that price you really don't have room to complain and that beer cheese and mustard dip (it has a kick, you've been warned) is to die for. The wings were the True hit of the night and we ordered a few of them.  The staff was super friendly and very accommodating for a party of five.  I really digged the decor of this restaurant and the kegerator wall with real kegs was definitely unique and fun. The party was wearing shorts and casual wear and didn't feel uncomfortable whatsoever.  We didn't have a reservation and were able to grab a table very quickly.  Can't wait to have a proper meal here the next time I'm in town.",

Great job, keep it up!  I ordered a classic Caesar and it was really good!  The anchovies were awesome!  Also ordered a Steak and Ale, which looked like a pot pie and pretty much is, but it had some delicious slow-roasted pot-roast type beef in it stewed with some veggies.  Yum!  Would definitely recommend this place to others to try, however, I have to state a note.  Note:  if ordering a steak, 3 of our 4 from our group of 7 was not cooked to correct temperature.   Order your meat more rare, 3 of the 4 were overdone.",

We waited so long for drinks - one cocktail, soda and water - that we were putting our coats on when they arrived. The waiter said, \"don't blame me I only put the order in.\" Really? Food was so so. Scratch that. The dressing for my salad was gross because it was so vinegary. And we waited forever for it. We were starving and I asked the waiter if he could bring something out quick. Quick turned out forever of an appetizer. Our water glasses were filled once by a hostess. Our waiter was too busy fawning over a six top of drinkers. Thank God we had a $100.00 voucher. Had I paid for that service I would have been really angry. Ironically we chose the restaurant because my son is such a fan of Gordon's show. P",

Like many other yelpers I read on here, we had to remind the hostess several times we were still waiting for our table even though we had a reservation.  As for the service, our server was a doll, really I liked the guy and he had a great knowledge of the menu, but the restaurant moved at a glacial pace.  For one it took a long time for them to just take our orders.  As an appetizer I got the shrimp salad, which was very good and came pretty fast.  For dinner I got the Sheppard's Pie, and our entrees took a long long time to arrive, I didn't time it, but it was very obvious.  My pie, was ok, very salty, nothing I would really say wowed me (or was worth the hefty $23 price).  Dessert we had Sticky Toffee pudding, a personal favorite of mine and it was the best part of the meal.  It was very delicious.    My husband had the fish and chips, which he liked, but thought was overpriced ($30).  He also had the corn soup, which was very good he said.    Overall, I would say go, but expect to be at dinner 2 plus hours, so if you have show tickets or somewhere to be, make an early reservation, because this place is slow.  I also think the prices are a bit hefty for pub grub.  If I went again I would just get an appetizer and dessert, because I found the main dishes disappointing and expensive.",

I started out night keeping my expectations low, I hate being disappointed. I started with a cocktail, the \"Goodbye Blue Sky\". It was a delicious concoction of blueberry vodka, sparkling wine, & chambord. For my main, I had the NY Strip w the butter bernnaise sauce. Even though it was a bit overdone (my fault for asking medium-well instead of medium), it was tender, flavorful, and absolutely THE BEST steak I've had. The accompanying grilled asparagus was cooked perfectly too.  My friend had the lamb, and at a bit too rare for me, it was damn tasty also.  We shared a side of lobster mac' n cheese. All I can say about this dish is OMFG!! With the first bite my eyes were rolling to the back of my head....the cheeses, the perfect macaroni, and the lobster....the LOBSTER! There were whole claws of meat....it was perfection!  We shared the spotted doc for dessert.  The bread pudding was just right, and the sauce not too sweet.  Yes, I'll be thinking of this meal for a while with much fondness and awe.....and know that since I have proof with the pics I took that yes, it really did happen. :)",

    "text": "I love Gordon Ramsay, so I couldn't wait to try his place at Ceasars Palace! Nice decor, great outfits on the wait staff (kind of like 90's punk), and rather friendly. I liked that they incorporated tablets/iPads into their drink and dessert menu, very modern. The food selections were your usual pub fare (fries, burgers, etc.) with some nicer exceptions (scallops, fresh fish, etc.). We tried the sliders (called something else) and the scallops, very fresh and tasty. The only small nit-picky complaint was that the entrees were not very hot when they arrived, but still were wonderfully prepared. The pretzel and cheese free bread appetizer was so yummy, I'd go back just for that! Overall, a good experience, but be prepared to pay for it! With no drinks (sodas or alcohol) the total was $100 bill for four items. Hint: Make a reservation! We walked right in with a reservation but others were waiting for over an hour on a Saturday night.",

    "text": "Not worth the time. We went on a Friday night and were thoroughly underwhelmed. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. The appetizers actually came before our drinks did I have never seen that before. The onion soup was pretty good every one else's appetizers were roughly OK not bad but not exactly up to the expected quality that the name attached to the restaurant would suggest. Main courses were nothing special the flat iron steak was disappointing basically a fancy way of saying fried -undercooked on the inside burnt black on the outside I'd say that was quite an accomplishment if it wasn't my food. Wife had the fingerling potatoes that the waiter suggested we're the best potatoes he's ever had. My guess is that he hasn't had many potatoes then. They were very bland. One of our number had the fish and chips and seemed moderately happy with it though so perhaps only 5/6 people leave disappointed. Mr Ramsey should be embarrassed to have his name attached to this place. We Will never return here.",

    "text": "Wow!!  This place has gone down hill!  The pretzels and cheese that used to be free are now $10 for three pretzel sticks. When we asked the server, Tayler, why they are now charging for bread he said \" we are trying to run a business and people would come in, eat the free bread sticks and then leave\".  I stated maybe they should give the bread after the order is put in. He stated \"you know our rent is $250,000 per month\".  My thought, you can't argue with stupid. They also removed the truffled fingerling potatoes, that was my favorite, from the menu. We ordered fish and chips and sliders. The fish and Chips were $30 and are only average. When some of us were done with our subpar meal the bus boy began removing plates and reaching right over my plate as I was still attempting to eat. I suggested to him that maybe he should wait until we are all done.   Tayler, in all his brilliance, decided to come over and tell us that the bus boy was the best they had, blah,blah, blah. In a nutshell Gordon Ramsay needs to bring kitchen nightmares in to his own place and Tayler, you need to learn that the customer is always right and to shut your stupid mouth.  Skip this place Vegas is full of top notch restaurants fantastic food and stellar service.",

    "text": "Came for dinner opening week.  No reservation, pretty easy to get a table.  This is an attractive restaurant, I really enjoyed the decor and uniforms.  Service was also pretty good aside from the one major issue of the night, menus (minus 1 star).  There were 4 people in our party and we had three menus showing one price and one menu that was about $10 higher per entree.  It is a big difference if the Shepard's pie is $25 or $16.  We asked about the price difference and the server immediately took away the expensive menu, but it makes me wonder...  The food was all great.  Portion sizes were average for the Shepard's pie, large for the pork chop, and VERY tiny for the lamb riblettes appetizer.   Beer selection was great including a dry English cider.  Sticky toffee pudding was very good served in a traditional fashion with plenty of sauce.   Value was reasonable for Vegas standards using the prices on the cheaper menu.  I will happily return as long as the expensive menu prices don't take effect.",

I requested a birthday desert to be brought without having to ask...said to just add to the bill. The server said \"So, we are celebrating a birthday?\" Then never brought desert! Ugh! She had to circle back again and again to double and triple check what was ordered. We had to chase our drinks! Never brought one beer then she brought it and another server brought one (not as sweet as it sounds...all got added to the bill LOL!) But she did smile the whole time. Frustrating but still fun. Believe it or not, we would go back! Burger was da bomb! The fries were totally unique...\"I only had 4 fries\" but they were 4 fries on steroids...more than enough! LOL Perfect light crisp outside and soft hot potato inside, served with seemed like a ketchup / horse radish side...WHY is there NO menu anywhere online? Oh we started with the pretzels breadsticks with a ground mustard sauce and a cheese sauce...yuh to the um!",

    "text": "Was just in Vegas to celebrate mine and my husband's birthday--both share October birthday month.  Anyway, we had wanted to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, so my aunt, cousin and her fiancee took us here for dinner.    Husband had the Shepherd's Pie and thought it was terrible.  It looked more like an appetizer than a meal.  He said it was bland and nothing to write home about.  He had some of the \"chips\" from my Fish and Chips. He was left dissatisfied and disappointed after he finished his \"meal\".  Both myself and my aunt ordered the fish and chips entree as we thought it would be out of this world since we were in the restaurant of this renowned chef and both love fish and chips.  The fish, while cooked perfectly and WAS a large portion, was totally tasteless.  No seasoning was used whatsoever.  We both kept reaching for the vinegar to help liven it up some.  The french fries (chips) were very good, seasoned perfectly.  There were peas on the plate--not my favorite--but I tasted them and found them to be awful, too.  We did have an appetizer--the deviled eggs--and while they were okay in taste, the eggs were WAY overcooked.    The service--or shall I say lack thereof?  The service was THE WORST I've experienced in recent memory.  The server treated us like we were putting him out for asking for things that should have already been delivered in the first place.  I felt so bad for my family who took us there for our birthdays, only to have such a rotten experience.  The only thing I felt was worthwhile at that restaurant, was the sticky toffee pudding we tasted for dessert.  That was really good. Also, if I could pick out anything else that would be considered noteworthy from that restaurant...the utensils were pretty cool in their design.  I will never go back there again.  For what it costs to eat there, they ought to be turning it up a notch and then treating the patrons MUCH better than they do.",

Luckily, we had made reservations, so the seating wasn't a hassle. The decor is that of an upscale pub. It was warm and inviting, but still felt too modern to have that \"Old English\" feel. Either way, it was nice to be there. As we were sat by a smoking hot hostess, we were immediately delivered water and bread. The bread basket was out of this world! Especially the pretzel bread. I ordered the pork bellies and fingerling potatoes. Rarely do I say this, but the side dish was WAY better than the main course. Don't get me wrong the pork bellies were crackling good and tender, but something about those potatoes that drove me insane! Overall, a fantastic experience with a cool way to order your drinks- thanks to the sophisticated computer tablets on the table. But like I said, a good time was had by all and the food was delicious. I recommend.",

    "text": "I tried to email Gordon Ramsay with a review of our dinner and I got a reply that says they get too many emails and couldn't answer. Are that many people complaining??????  So here is my email.  Dear Mr. Ramsay,  I hope this email finds its way to you. I thought I would give it a try.   My husband and I were in Las Vegas this past weekend celebrating our 24th anniversary (it's actually on Oct 16th) We had tickets to see Celine Dion at Caesar's palace. Apparently Celine didn't know our anniversary was the 16th or I am sure she would have performed that evening. (Doubt it) We decided to try your pub at Caesar's since it was right there.  First off, my husband is a big fan of your show. He watches several cooking shows and yours is right up there on top. So we wanted to eat somewhere special. Personally it doesn't matter to me because I don't like to cook and have been blessed with a husband who really enjoys it. (Thank goodness!)  We showed up for our reservation and were seated right away.  Our waitress and all the wait staff was more than pleasant.  Things went downhill fast from there........... We ordered a cocktail, Gin & tonic for my husband and a Vodka martini (up) for me. My husband's drink was wonderful and mine was as warm as tapwater. No problem,  I thought it could happen. Not going to complain over such a minor issue.  For dinner, my husband ordered the Burger with truffle fries.  So let's start with his meal....... The fries that were brought out were  plain fries. I hate to think what you would have done to one of your chef's if they served plain instead of truffle fries. Again, no problem we simply asked our server and she took care of it right away. I had the flat iron steak and it was just ok. It was Ok if I was at Chili's or Outback (not that they serve a bad meal) but not Gordon Ramsay good. I was however, looking for some kind of bread or dinner roll.  The waitress told me that I would have to order a side of bread and pay.......again, no problem, I wanted a piece of damn bread with my steak. So what came out towards the end of my meal was undercooked pita bread and butter. Yikes, I couldn't keep quiet any longer and had to tell her that it was awful pita bread when she asked how everything was. I didn't and wouldn't have asked her to remove the cost from our meal but she was very sweet and offered.  So my point in all of this is...... the meal was just average except for the price ($150) and we were expecting a \"Hell's Kitchen\" quality meal.  I thought you might like to know how the restaurants that are promoting your name are actually cooking your meals below what we you're your standard is.   Disappointedly Yours,",

The ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. Nothing else lived up to our expectations and was mediocre. The mac n cheese was dry and gritty, the Shepard pie was strange and the potatoes on top tasted instant and not toasted. The scotch egg came out cold. The fish and chips were two tiny pieces of fish for $30 and were completely bland. So sad because I wanted to love it.",

We gave the total rewards card with the payment.  They never applied it for the reduced rate.  We had to ask for them to give us the reduced pricing.  It took forever and was SHADY...  They should have just APPLIED it without me having to call them on it.",

The hellfire wings and the short rib kettle chip nachos were delicious, the Sticky toffee pudding was outstanding.  I also tried a burger which was also very good.  I was disappointed with the Shepard's Pie though, it lacked seasoning and flavor.  Daisy my server was excellent and went over the menu with me and pointed out the highlights.  Gordon Ramsey really is worth every penny he charges, one of the best celebrity chefs in Vegas.  Bonus if you check in on Yelp you get a free sticky toffee pudding",

    "text": "As many others have reported, we had to wait a while before we saw our server. Since there was no sign of anyone after several minutes, I told the hostess that we needed to catch a plane (which wasn't a total lie) and we saw our server a few minutes later. From that point onward, the service was excellent.  I got the English beer sampler, four 4-ounce mini \"pints\" of beer, while my wife got a glass of house chardonnay. We were happy with both choices.  I started with the lobster rolls and my wife got the Caesar salad. The lobster rolls were subtly dressed and tasty, but two rolls the size of my fist for $18 seemed overpriced. The salad, on the other hand, was generously portioned; I wish the dressing had a more pronounced anchovy flavor, but it was very good (comparable to Macaroni Grill's dressing).  The main course blew us away. I got the The Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich, which looks like a standard fair reuben, but is better in every way from what you'd normally expect, from the bread to the quality of the meat to the phenomenal cucumber aioli. My wife got the Scottish Salmon, and I asked her why she was eating it so slowly. She told me that it was so delicious that she wanted to savor every bite.  The only misstep was the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which we got because we kept hearing how great it was. I really wish the server hadn't poured the insanely sweet toffee syrup over the top of it as part of the presentation. The tiny parts of the bread pudding that weren't soaked in the syrup were sweet and nicely balanced. Unfortunately, the sweetness of the syrup was so bad we couldn't eat more than a small nibble before having to take several gulps of coffee just to wash it down. We gave up after only a few small bites. If anyone from the restaurant reads this PLEASE consider keeping the syrup in the mini pitcher that you bring it out with, so the diner has an option to add it themselves.",

    "text": "The food here is 5 star, easily. The service, on the other hand, was terrible.   We're staying in Nobu and wanted lunch after getting into Vegas; this place is super conveniently located, and you can walk straight out and gamble.   We got here at around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. It took our waiter, Michael, about 10 minutes to come introduce himself, and while the restaurant was busy, it was far from packed. We wanted to do a preemptive strike against the long night ahead, and ordered waters, which was when our waiter seemed to \"size\" us up. We're a mid-twenties couple, which in LA doesn't really have any bearing on the service we receive, but Michael definitely treated us differently from the older patrons around us.   We decided to start with some of the happy hour appetizers, and went with the pub nachos and hellfire wings. Both were AMAZING, and I would gladly come back for them. The pub nachos were a surprisingly large portion, and everything was fresh and cheesy and flavorful, without being greasy or too heavy, a surprising feat for kettle potato chips, pub cheese, and a ton of brisket. The wings were some of the best I've ever had; I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but the blue cheese sauce served with them was divine and the sauce they were tossed in was wonderful. Easily 5/5 on both of those. When we ordered these, though, our waiter took our menus and almost sprinted away, never asking if we were going to order more or not.   Our waiter didn't drop our appetizers himself, and he didn't come to check on us a single time while we were eating. We were planning to order more food, and my husband had to flag him down after about 20 minutes of him walking by us constantly, standing at the bar, and talking to other patrons. It was so blatant it was almost comical, except for the fact that we were paying customers.   When we finally got his attention, we ordered the steak and ale pie to split. It came out piping hot (literally), and was delicious. The ale came through in the savory broth, which was loaded with steak and fresh mushrooms, and the crust was crispy, soft heaven.   Again, our waiter never came to check on us while we were eating and didn't drop the food himself. After about 20 more minutes he brought us dessert menus, since we apparently now seemed like people who came to a restaurant to order food, but I was so annoyed at this point I was ready to leave.   This waiter was not in the weeds, the restaurant didn't have a wait, and I watched him provide basic service to other tables. I don't know if it's our age or what, but being ignored isn't something I typically pay for. I tipped him 15%, very low for us, and I maintain I would've been better taking that money to the roulette table. The food will bring us back, but we'll likely get it to-go.",

    "text": "Very excited to finally have a Gordon Ramsay experience,  we stopped in on a recent Monday evening.  We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait, but were seated within 5.  Things were looking up.      We should have checked the menu before going in though, because we really wanted to try a burger, but there was none on the menu.  Fortunately, our server told us he could get us one from the bar area, so that made us very happy! (we probably should have just gone to the bar, but we didn't know there were two different menus).     Having come from Happy Hour elsewhere not long before, we both just hydrated with iced tea, which was okay tea.  And since we weren't starving, we opted to share three things:  The onion soup, the burger and the infamous sticky toffee pudding.    The soup was possibly the best onion soup I've ever had...the broth was rich and delicious.  Not sure about anything that tasted like welsh cheddar rarebit though?       Big plus on the burger, they were kind enough to split it for us, so they brought us each a plate with fries.  The burger was very tasty, had a bit of a smokey flavor.  Good, but not the best we've ever had.  Husband kept saying he thought there was another meat in it besides beef...I don't know about that, I think he was tasting bacon.  The fries were okay, but unevenly cooked.  Some were mushy, some crisp and some in between.      The highlight was definitely the sticky toffee pudding.  Yep, it ranks right up there in sweet heaven like everyone says.    Service was also like most everyone has said.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  We were in there for what felt like forever.  We even got to know our two-top neighbors from Canada, who seemed to enjoy the beet salad they shared and their scallop entrees.    All-in-all,  with all the choices in Vegas, I just don't know that there's enough of a draw to go back.",

She made sure we were checked on regularly for top offs on the drinks, questions for the menus, and making sure our experience was nothing but stellar.    The food was great!  I had the lamb burger, extremely well priced.  The waitress suggested medium rare, and it couldn't have been done better.  Food was out in 10 or under,  and we have absolutely no comlaints.  The bill was extremely well priced in comparison to the prices of the surrounding areas.  And the location was perfect since my hunger appeared just as I was passing through the casino.  I'd definitely return during my next dalliance in Sin City.",

    "text": "I had the beef burger and it was delish. But at $18 (TR) it's pretty steep.  I asked for med rare but it was more medium. At medium it tasted pretty good. My burger didnt have a bottom bun! It was made with 2 top buns!! Yesss!! Everyone likes the top bun better. :) Fries were horrible.  We were going to order the fish and chips but we saw the next table have it and it was pretty dinky for $30. So we order a couple of app dishes instead since the only other seafood dish was Salmon. We ordered the Calamari and the Clams. The calamari which was delish!! It was topped with some thinly sliced peppers that tasted pickled. Pretty good!!  The clams were decent but be warned there are sausages in the dish!! For those who cant have meat.  I had a pint of sam adams which put me down $10.  It was either that or a $4 coke...ugh haha  Also our server tried to pull a fast one and didnt give us the TR discount...I had a feeling he wasnt going to...so I told him to recheck it and he did and \"fixed it\". Tsk tsk..I'm no stupid.",

    "text": "Disappointed!!!  Located inside Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Ramsay's 'authentic english pub' sells overpriced, under-portioned food.  Seriously, $30 for fish and chips??  Same for bangers and mash??  Now, I realize that the overhead here must be tremendous but this food is overpriced and there isn't enough of it.  We ordered 1 bottled beer each (Heineken) and the fish and chips and banger and mash.  Our bill, with tip, came to just over $100!!  Crazy.  The mashed potatoes were not fresh, the bangers tasted like hot dogs.  The french fries were soggy and the battered fish looked like it had been frozen.  Such a disappointment. I'm certain that Gordon NEVER sets food inside this restaurant which is exploiting his name.  In fact, I'm not sure who's exploiting who here.  We had plans for a 'Gordon Ramsay Food Tour' but, based on this experience at The Pub, we cancelled our plans. I figured we would get stuck with a much, much higher food tab at the Steak House in the Paris hotel so ..... nah, not so much.  This is a TOURIST TRAP.  Consider yourself warned regarding the pricey menu items.  PS. I lived in England for 20 years and this place is ANYTHING BUT an english pub.  Please.",

However, the Pub & Grill is grossly overpriced for the quality of food you get. I'm not a trained chef but I know what great food tastes like. The scallops were as Gordon would say, Rubber! The salmon was definitely over cooked. The Wellington tasted like metal. Yes, metal. We specifically said to the waitress that my husband was allergic to nuts. My husband's dessert was replaced with a creme brulee with an almond cookie. Really?!? Also, I thought Gordon Ramsay's motto was attention to detail. Our table was wobbling the whole time we were trying to eat our dinner. The service was okay, the environment was a bit chaotic.  I'm sorry but I was quite disappointed to think that Gordon Ramsay would put his name into this place.",

My friend and I went during memorial day weekend and expected the pub to be very busy but it wasn't bad at all. There was no wait and we were seated in English style chairs (very adorable) However the seats  were a bit uncomfortable since we had on dresses lol. So our awesome waitress ,Sara, kindly moved us to the booth were she claims she first met and served GR. Sara made the experience very personable by addressing my friend and I by our names throughout the whole service and making recommendations from beverages down to dessert.  We started with the Fish and Chips that came with an VERY AMAZING garlic aioli  and of course classic tartar sauce. The Cod was fresh and had a nice buttery texture- not too greasy . After ,we had the appetizer, Lobster and shrimp rolls. Of course, the shrimp and lobster blended in the in house sauce was delightful but the BEST part was the freshly baked bread !This may seem greedy but we also tried the shepherd's pie because it's a pub classic !The shepherd's pie was great for my first time having ground lamb topped with creamy cheddar mashed potatoes which was also a first for me ! LASTLY, my friend and I had dessert  and  we decided on the classic sticky toffee pudding and  the toffee cheesecake. I don't want to seem dramatic so ill just say it was an amazing way to end our meal.   I almost forgot! The manager Derek did come out to greet my friend and I to  ensure that we were having a pleasant experience and only had good things to say about his staff. ENJOY the photos and next time you're in Vegas  please go and experience GR's  Pub and Grill.",

They are not serving their beer flights due to \"problems with the glass ware\" according to our server. Food came VERY quickly. They are really trying to turn tables and the meal felt rushed. My dining companion enjoyed his shepherds pie and lobster mac and cheese. My salmon was good but all the sides on the plate tasted like they'd been sprayed with lemon Pledge. Lemon mashed potatoes?  Disgusting. Chemical aftertaste. Server checked in once but I was only one bite into the meal.  $150 including drinks and tip seems steep for what we got, especially given the inedible sides on one entree. Other Ramsay restaurants in the area are far superior. Try Hell's Kitchen or Steak instead.",

The steaks were cooked perfectly - 2 were ordered, both medium.    Just OK: I had the chop salad.  The vinaigrette dressing was good and the protein (salami, grilled chicken, and chickpeas) was a nice variety.  Someone had the filet and it was par for the course.    The Bad: My beer was poured into a glass table side for me and had a 50% foam head that billowed out of the glass onto the placemat.  Never got asked if I wanted another beer.  The flat iron steak had an funky bacon flavor to it.  I think it was cooked in rendered bacon fat.  I had a bite and it was off-putting to have a steak texture with a bacon flavor like that.    You pay for \"Gordon\" on the strip inside Caesar's, but the price point doesn't match the experience.",

Our main goal was to try the sticky toffee pudding, but needed a little something else first.  Wife and I split and burger.  On the positive, the burger came out cut in half with two plates making it easy and a nice presentation for splitting a meal.  The downside was that the burger was a bit overcooked.  The medium we ordered was definitely towards the well done side.  Not a big deal for me, but wife wasn't digging it.  It did taste good though - it wasn't a bad burger, except for the over charred parts.  And the fries were good.  Finally got to the sticky toffee pudding and it was pretty darn good.  My friend called it life changing... I wouldn't go that far, but it was tasty.  I wouldn't turn my back on it.  The employees seemed friendly and our server definitely was.  She was really nice and attentive.  Bonus points for how many beers I saw her carrying out on one tray.  I'm interested enough to come back.  It wasn' the best dining experience in Vegas, but I had a nice time and would try something else if I wound up here again.",

Next the STAR of the show...those hot wings. Boy oh boy were they delicious! The flavor was so unique and had so much depth. By far the yummiest, most unique tasting wings I've ever had! The blue cheese /ranch dip on the side was so good I was licking it off of my fingers.   The cocktails were made very well. My only critique would be the lackluster waitress we had but overall my tastebuds gave this 5 stars! Highly recommend.",

My husband and I shared the following:  1) Shepard's pie: we really enjoyed this. The flavors were well balanced. It was ground lamb (the way it should be). Gravy, lamb, root veggies, mashed potatoes. Also came with a side spring mixed salad for some freshness.  Total comfort food. One negative was the mini pretzel bread that accompanied the dish was super hard and almost stale.  2) sauteed forest mushrooms with a poached egg: this is what I wanted. Simple sauteed mushrooms but cooked right. Then you have a poached egg on top. Bomb!  3) beef poutine: I did not try this because I was full but my husband said it was a tad salty. Half was left uneaten.  4) toffee bread pudding (free when you check in on Yelp): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.dot.com&s=430c119cd3117582ed49382b48a491943dc36f889ccd6576482bc762a0802b43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.dot.com</a> it was delicious! The bread was warm, moist and so soft. The vanilla ice cream that came with it was a perfect compliment.  We both loved this. Not to mention...it was free 99!  Service was super quick, efficient and courteous. We had a pretty good late night dining experience here.",

It didn't take too long to get our food.  We split the two meals so we each could try bith and Christopher had requested the kitchen cut the burger in half since we were sharing.  The fish was perfectly battered and fried. It was not greasy. The fries were more like flat steak fries. I would have liked them crisper and not flimsy but they were good non the less.  Next - the burger. We added bacon which was a nice touch. Asked for medium and it definitely was. It was flavorful, juicy, overall a really good burger.  We finished it off with sticky pudding. Which is not pudding at all. It was a moist cake, vanilla ice cream on top and a nice carmel type of sauce. Light, perfect amount of sweetness. A really nice finish to a great meal.  It is however on the pricey side. But worth it.",

    "text": "Came here because a friend recommended it, and I've wanted to hit a Gordon Ramsey restaurant for some time.   Summary: if London themed fare is what you're after, this is the spot. It's one of my personal favorites in Las Vegas.  Brussel sprouts - it says roasted, but it's more a glazed sweet/savory thing where the sprouts aren't necessarily crispy. They tasted fine - just a little different than I expected from the description.   My buddy got the fish and chips, and they reportedly tasted very good.   I got the curry chicken with rice and naan.  Curry: better than most Indian places I've tried. Savory with the right amount of spice (might be a little spicy for those of you that don't normally eat it). Well colored, the chicken was tender, and it was gone soon.   Naan was fine - it was more pita bread than authentic Indian naan. The rice was a nice twist, strong herbal aftertaste and yellowed.   Server was the bartender Kevin, and he was legit. His family has a background in chemistry (mixology anyone?), majored in hospitality, and loves Vegas. He makes his own mead (fermented honey), along with beer and other spirits. He was friendly, helpful, good at what he does, and up for fun conversation.   And he had the kitchen whip up something I requested: an extra thick Bailey's vanilla shake. I have pictures, but I can't explain how perfectly it was mixed. It's not on the menu, but it should be. Thick vanilla ice cream with a touch of milk and just enough Baileys to notice.   A lot of Vegas restaurants are over-hyped when it comes to food. This one delivers on all fronts. It would be one of my regulars at Vegas. Go!",

The sandwich was terrific, with a bit of spice to the dressing, wonderful bread nicely toasted, and fantastic beef. I also happened to eat every single potato chip. My wife said that the wedge salad was \"the best salad I've ever eaten.\" I snuck a bite (or two) and agree that it was very, very good. All ingredients were clearly fresh, the amount of bleu cheese was indulgent, and the vinaigrette was perfectly balanced. The only \"grr\" was the service, and we were seated right next to the waiter's station. It took quite a long time to get started, but once started, it was fine.

A big shout out to Joe, who sat us quickly near a screen so we could watch our nuggets game beforehand. Why the 3 stars? The food. The poutine was very good but the calamari was dry, no flavor and very uninspired. I've never understood why in this country everyone feels the need to crumb, batter and fry the bejeezus out of such a delicate food. All it needs is a flash fry without any coating with flavors such as garlic, chilli and pepper.  Otherwise, the pub was good, busy and an excellent choice of beers.",

We sat at the bar where our bartender Matt was perfect amounts engaging and conversational while also non-intrusive after we got our food and drinks. Make sure you check in to get the free sticky toffee pudding! I actually really liked it! Free dessert, how could I not?  We ordered the truffle chips ($5) which were damn addicting and delicious probably because they are cooked in truffle oil and topped with truffle as well! Our bartender mentioned it was \"death by truffle\" and honestly there's no better way to die.   I ordered the pub crawl and Danny boy, both $12. They were both very good; I preferred the Danny boy as it tasted like an old fashioned but they were both very refreshing.  Overall, I really liked this place. The Gordon Ramsay-related restaurants I've been to in Vegas so far have not disappointed.",

We like GR because the food is simple, basic competent and delivered at a high standard. It was the basics that we're missing: fries that were oily and soft, oddly chewy instead of crispy. The pie samplers were OK, but nothing special and maybe a little runny inside. I've had better in good London pubs. The waiter agreed that when they are made in small ramekins, they don't cook quite the same. I have an idea: THEN DON'T FREAKING OFFER THEM!  I will say the lamb burger was absolutely awesome! If the chips had been right, I would've added a star.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stopped at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill in Ceasars Palace to meet up with friends.  We arrive around 4:00pm, during their happy hour.  The hostess was in a conversation with some coworkers and never acknowledged us.  We waited a minute or two and then proceeded to the table where our friends were.  They were the only occupied table in the restaurant.  There were a few guests at the bar.  Our friends  had put in an order for some appetizers and drinks for themselves before we arrived.  A server brought water to our table but said he could not take our order as he was not our waiter.  Eventually a waiter came and took our drink order and to make a long story short, that was the last time we saw him at our table.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come with anything but it did not happen. To pass the uncomfortable time, my husband and I walked to the poker room thinking that when we got back our order would be on the table.  It wasn't.  My husband went up to the bar to place the order with the bartender instead.  BIG mistake.  The bartender rolled his eyes and made it clear that this was an imposition.  We ended up canceling our order and asked to speak to the manager.  He was less interested and as rude as the bartender.  Gordon Ramsay has a reputation for perfection.  Clearly this establishment would not meet his expectations!  There are hundreds of amazing restaurants in Las Vegas! Don't wast your time here, go directly to The Palm Restaurant or Olives in Bellagio! You will be glad you did!",

The sauce green bean mix that was the bed was soggy tho. The cherry custard was nice.  Hint of cinnamon was a nice surprise.   On the negative side,  the water was warm.  I requested lemon and it didn't show up until half way through my meal.  The main course was brought out before I had hardly touched my salad.  They took it back.  Which is probably why things were soggy. It took over 15 minutes for the dessert to show up.  I enquired about an herbal tea. They didn't have any,  so I declined.  Then someone shows up with a green tea., which I sent away.  The kicker was the waiters comment when he brought my check.  He said I had eaten more than anyone he had seen that day and had taken my time.  How rude!  I didn't finish my salad or my dessert.  Not sure how 3 courses is excessive.  Rude!",

He served our entrees first before our mussels and clams appetizer.  The mussels tasted like mud, not fresh and tender.  It was just very musky.  The bacon burger was just ok, nothing real special about it.  It was under favored.  For $19, I expected a bit more.  Then the Steak and ale pie also lacked in favor.

Also, while the food was tasty, it cost us 82 dollars after tip for: One can of beer, two beef hamburgers, and one BLT.   I know Vegas is expensive but the meal wasn't worth more than thirty five or forty bucks, tops - even in Vegas.  My advice:  find somewhere less expensive with better service. You'll be happier.",

We were seated right away, but in requesting that we did not get one of the \"high\" bar style tables we saw at the entrance, were shown instead to an oversize \"booth\" consisting of a table and two large but lightweight movable couches. This proved to be somewhat uncomfortable, I felt like I was hunching over my food the entire meal as the table was too low for the level of the couches and the couches better suited for lounging than eating. All I could think was, if I wanted to eat dinner at my couch in front of my TV, I would do so. Might be fun with a larger group but it was not very intimate for 2.   So lets get to the food, we had the calamari appetizer which was light, perfectly fried and tasty, and also a decent size portion as well. The accompanying sauces were the standard cocktail and aioli, uninventive but appreciated. We both decided on the lamb burger, which was enormous. If anything the meat to bun ratio here is unbalanced, the patty could be downsized a little bit or bun upsized without losing anything, the meat overwhelmed the remaining ingredients on the burger to the point you felt like you were eating just a big pile of patty. It was a very good lamb burger nonetheless.  Meanwhile, the accompanying fries were nothing to write home about, and like the fried squid, they also came in a suitably large portion.   The service was surprisingly poor, my iced tea glass remained empty at one point for more than 10 minutes during our meal, and we were not attended to promptly when sitting down. I suppose by American standards the service was \"normal\" and Europeans would find it too fast a pace.   Lastly, the place was quite expensive, you do indeed pay for the name in addition to the food. Two burgers, an appetizer and two sodas cost us $85 with tip. I was expecting this, but its worth noting nonetheless.",

Overall, it's got a nice vibe.  The beer list didn't do much for me as there wasn't anything particularly notable. But all the standard ones you'd expect at a pub are there.  We ordered the calamari, fish and chips, English ale onion soup, and lobster mac 'n' cheese. Our server somehow forgot the lobster mac 'n' cheese and brought us fries instead. She promptly fixed the error, leaving the fries and putting in an order for the lobster mac 'n' cheese. But then she added the fries to our bill! Seriously.   The calamari was alright. Good enough to eat when you're hungry. Not good enough to ever order again. The fish and chips were good. They're fish and chips - nothing particularly notable, but the fish was battered and fried well. The English ale soup was quite tasty and the best thing of the night. The fries were alright. Would never actually order them. The lobster mac 'n' cheese was tasty. But I've had far better elsewhere and probably wouldn't order it again here given the price for the small portion.  Aside from the order mix-up, we had a pleasant evening here. It's a perfectly fine place. Good enough food, but not the wow food that one often comes to expect of Vegas dining.",

Obscene menu with a large array of choices.  /ATMOSPHERE  Large, open space with unusual dining tables and chairs. It's basically like eating while you're sitting in your favorite recliner. I liked it.  /FOOD  I went with the lamb burger. It was hella good. However, I went splits with another mate at the table who went with the fish and chips. Not so good. I was disappointed that I gave up half of my lamb burger. Chips are mediocre. That is sacrilege.  /SERVICE  Very good and accommodating. Had no qualms splitting our check one thousand ways. However, they never indicated tip was included. It did show up on the main bill though, so I caught it before we also started writing them in as it does not show up on the split bills.  HOW TO READ MY REVIEWS: 1 Star - Does not approach edible. Enter at your own risk. 2 Stars - If I'm in the area, I'd pick something else. 3 Stars - I would stop by if I happen to be in the area. 4 Stars - I would pick this place out of other places nearby. 5 Stars - I would go out of my way to dine here.",

Pretty sure they were at the bottom of the pan as they were too sweet and over sauced to be palatable.  They don't offer salt on the table assuming because the chefs are experts at seasoning everything to perfection. We asked for salt and never received it....     The chop salad was fine, but the fish and chips were underwhelming. All for a price tag of over $100.  So many great food options in Vegas - super bummed to have wasted a meal and my dollars here.

    "text": "This restaurant is AMAZING from the food to the service everything is top notch! There was only a short wait on the weekend.   Our waitress was really great, she asked for our names and talked to us by our names the entire time. Now where do you ever see that? She gave a very welcoming and friendly vibe. Service was fantastic the whole time.   The food was...incredible. I was blown away with all of the flavors and how delicious everything was. The soft shell crab sandwich was the best that I've had, the crab was cooked perfectly. The Mac and cheese had so much flavor. I usually like very cheesy Mac and cheese, this one wasn't too cheesy but the flavor definitely made up for it. I can proudly say it was some of the best Mac and cheese I've had.   Check in for a free desert! That toffee cake was out of this world good. So soft and delicious. There is a few of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants in Vegas. This one was a bit more casual, but the food and service without a doubt was 5 stars. Highly recommend.",

It came to the table luke-warm, the noodles were a little undercooked and it pretty much tasted like Kraft Mac and cheese with a few pieces of lobster meat thrown in. I had a side order of the Yukon mashed potatoes which are normally the best I've ever eaten but not this time. I've eaten here before but this time was a total disappointment.",

    "text": "Hi last night (c9:30pm 09/15/19) my mother and I dined with you having just arrived in Las Vegas for my mother's birthday and we were both absolutely appalled and disappointed with the quality of the service, the food and the environment!  Firstly the air conditioning was on so high I needed two napkins to keep warmer! There was no way I could order hot food as it would have been chilled by time I ate it the atmosphere was freezing with a big draught coming from the back of where we were initially seated. I asked to move to be told there were only 'high tables' available so I said we'd leave as my mother is 63 years old. All of a sudden a few tables became free so we were moved there.  The food was shocking, I even feel like sending Gordon a message (my partner is his bodyguard) to feedback our visit with you. We have visited Atlantic city branch and were amazed by the quality of food but here was possibly the worst meal I have ever experienced - no joke.   The mushy peas ordered with my mum's fish and chips were cold, so we asked for them to be heated up and they returned once she had finished her meal. My kale and chicken salad had no butternut squash and the chicken was chewy and grisly. I asked for the squash to be added and when it returned to me the waiter explained it was at the bottom of the salad (I can assure you it was not!). The staff were very rude.  The staff knew their service and quality of food was not up to any fit standard although they did not say anything but offered us a free sticky toffee pudding of which we refused because we wanted to leave immediately and forget the experience.   Had it not been for my mother's birthday I would not have paid for one food item but as it was our first night I didn't want to cause a fuss.  PL",

    "text": "I wish I could give more stars. Service is excellent. Gluten free options are excellent (see pic). Decor is excellent. Everything was just freakin' excellent. Read on for details.  For some reason, finding gluten free options on the strip is really difficult. You'd think with the overwhelming options around here that every restaurant would be competing for everyone's patronage. Whether that means catering to vegans, those with allergies or whatever medical restrictions, you'd think they'd try. But that doesn't seem to be the case.  Living in LA, we come to Vegas often as a quick escape. And when we do, it is for 2 main reasons.... To sleep and to eat. We wander the strip aimlessly shopping and sightseeing in-between meals and naps. That's our thing. So food ends up being mighty important.   Tonight we were doing our usual wandering after a glorious mid-day nap and we were in the mood for some Mexican. Our plan was to hit up a fave place in the Miracle Mile but as we passed by Hell's Kitchen we suddenly had a craving for some good ol' Gordon Ramsey quality food. But we didn't know Hell's Kitchen needed a reservation weeks in advance. So we wandered into Caesar's to find Ramsey's pub that we had walked past earlier in the day. Soooooo glad we came here.  Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill is our new favorite casual restaurant on the strip.  We were seated quickly even though the place was busy. The decor is the perfect mix of vintage British meets modern hipster. Even the wooden placemats make for a unique experience. And it is relatively inexpensive considering it's location. Win!  Our server, Sladjan, was phenomenal. He greeted us right away and acted as if we were his only table even though he had several other tables already seated and had others sitting down right after us.  We ordered drinks and as he checked our IDs he noticed my boyfriend's name. So the two of them bonded over their similar upbringings (Bulgarian and Serbian). And then after ordering drinks our server did something so unexpected. You ready?   He asked if we had any allergies and when we both said that I am gluten free he asked what kind of gluten free \"preference, intolerance or Celiac\" whhhhaaaatttt? Even high-end fancy places usually don't bother to differentiate between the types of gluten free peeps. I can count on one hand how many fancy strip restaurants I've been to that seem to have any knowledge of Celiac as a disease rather than just gluten free as a \"lack of ingredients\". Needless to say, I was super impressed.  I did have to ask for the gluten free menu but that's no biggie... because they actually have one! And not only do they have a gluten free menu but it has a secret option. You can get a burger with a gluten free bun! And the bun doesn't cost extra! Nowhere on the regular people menu is this mentioned so this was a welcome surprise and without hesitation I ordered the burger.  The burger arrived with a side salad. Sladjan apologized for the side salad as a replacement for the fries but explained that since I was Celiac and not just gluten free that they wouldn't be safe for me. I had already assumed this but it was nice of him to explain why I didn't get fries.   We finished our meals, I finished my two delicious cocktails and I pulled up my Yelp app to show our server that we had the free toffee pudding offer for checking in. I told him that I knew I couldn't eat it but I wanted my bf to enjoy it. And then, without skipping a beat he says, \"No, there is a gluten free strawberry parfait. I'll get you that instead so you can eat too\". We thanked him and eagerly awaited our parfait. Before it was delivered he came to the table to assure me that everything was gluten free in the parfait including \"... the little cookie things on top. All gluten free. You're good.\"   Ummmm, so not only does this restaurant HAVE gluten free options and a gluten free menu but our server is super knowledgeable and goes out of his way to make sure everything is safe for me and that we are happy as can be. If that's not an experience deserving of more than 5 stars, I don't know what is.  BTW... The boyfriend got the Caesar salad with chicken and anchovies and he loved it. Even the croutons were really good. \"Like homemade\".   We downed our scrumptious not-too-sweet parfait, paid the bill, left a great tip and went back to our room to pass out again. A great final night in Vegas all thanks to Sladjan and our new favorite restaurant.",

If you haven't tried it I've gotten all of my friends hooked on this delicious sweet savory dessert. It is a masterpiece. Pudding is actually cake in British English. It tastes like a caramel chocolate cake but it's actually made from Dates. There's no way I can do justice to this but really I am NOT a dessert person but Sticky Toffee Pudding is an exception.   The best part is that if you check in on Yelp, you'll get one for FREE. I typically order 2 puddings plus I get a free one for checking in. Make sure to go to the bar to make your orders and it'll come out within 10 min.",

All the Vegas Bling Bling gets your heart pumped up though! After a 48 minute hard fought battle with \"the spouse\" - back and forth on where to go for dinner, I Lost. And boy am I glad!  Dear Chef Gordon Ramsay,  You made me cry twice today. Came to your Pub...where were you? Looked everywhere, asked everyone but to no avail. 1st tear.  Luckily the staff in charge is completely amazing, delightful, and well trained. Had reservations but arrived early. The place was bouncing with people, full, to the \"fish and chip gills\" but the Hostess' words of \"No problem\" was like a sonnet to my ears! (did I mentioned I was tired?)  Our evening server and now friend Miss Evie took such great care of our roost; she was such a pleasure. Her genteel manner and service was remarkable.  On to the 2nd tear Chef Ramsey- Our order consisted of:  *Appetizers- Crispy Calamari and Lobster Rolls. These dishes need no work, please leave them as they are;stunningly delicious! *Ordered 2 Stella Draft beers, a 35oz for the loser of the earlier battle and a 20oz for the Lady whom did not even break a sweat in that exchange.  *Main Course- Prime Rib (medium rare) and order of Fish and Chips. The Prime Rib was done to perfection with Mash Potatoes following suit. Again amazing!  Now for the 2nd tear- The Fish and Chips were SENSATIONAL! A total Knock-Out! The tear came out because it brought back memories of a stint at English Public school, how this meal was authentic, and very indicative of how it tastes in England. Bravo!  Bravo! Thank you Chef. As if that wasn't enough, you graciously sent out a free Sticky Toffee Pudding. I knew right then, you were at the Pub watching me eat with full delight and splendor. The heavenly dessert was consumed VICIOUSLY!...as it should be.  I close now giving you many thanks and warmest regards, Ever Faithfully yours, Jon H.  PS...my battle contender \"the Spouse\" said I wouldnot finish the 35oz Stella. So after dissipating the \"35\" with full vigor, I had to win that quarrel (at least) by ordering an extra 20oz for me, consuming it with a grin, slowly, like a World Class Champ or Chimp :/",

Not sure what to eat we passed by Gordon's Pub, stopped to look at the menu, saw that it was happy hour and decided to try it because I love Gordon's Fish & Chips so I thought,  why not. The atmosphere was cool. Beer kegs as decor, cool silverware and place mats, interesting burlap type  napkins and funky leather looking staff uniforms.    I was eating with my friend who is a Chef. We ordered every food item on the happy hour menu, 2 beers and bone marrow and asparagus which were not on the happy hour menu.   Service was eh. My friend was annoyed because our waitress came by only once to ask us how we were. My friend wanted to order another beer. We had to wait awhile. The water guy came by more than our waitress. He was great.  Food was eh.... pretzels came out cold, the menu said they were supposed to be hot. Truffle fries were ok but there was too much truffle so it over powered the fries. Chicken wings were dry. The one pig in a blanket was ok, nothing remarkable. The one slider was ok but the bread fell apart. Not sure why. The bone marrow was good but for the price the portion was small. The toast that was served with the marrow was burnt. My friend literally had a conniption. \"Look at this, it's burnt. I would never send something like this out.\"   Overall it was disappointing. I expected more.  Would I go there again? No",

The burger was dry and the bun was either burnt or stale, the best part of the meal were the fries.  Excellent fries! Maybe worth $5.  The rest was a complete waste of money given the great restaurant selections on the strip.

    "text": "I'm surprised that Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, which is located in the Caesar's Palace Hotel - only has a 3.5 rating! I really enjoyed my first visit, where we received great customer service from our server, Josnin and the food was delicious!   My cousins and I (a party of 5) shared a ton of appetizers and they had decent sized portions where we were soooooo full after, it was hard to walk lol.   Here's what we ordered:   1. Bone Marrow w/ Oxtail jam - although it was a flavorful bone marrow, the amount of meat on the bone was small so maybe got one or two scoops of bone marrow and that was it. The depth of the bone marrow was slightly deceiving and there wasn't that much meat. The small amount of Oxtail sprinkled atop was tasty. This dish comes with slices of bread.   2. Steak Tartare - yum! Now this was good! The added capers really bring out a delicious flavor! I would order this again and again! The meat is fresh which you can tell by the color. The portion was decent - you can buy two to share between 5 people.   3. Pork Belly - mhmmm, this was good too! I really appreciated the crunch from the skin and the juiciness that dripped down. Try this!   4. Lobster Mac n' Cheese - 5 stars alllllll the way up for this dish! The noodles were cooked perfectly; there was just the right amount cheese and the best part...a ton of lobster sitting right on the dish! Wow - this Mac is delicious! I was 2nds, 3rds... you get the picture!   There were a few other things that we ordered but I didn't get the chance to try: the scallops and Shepard's pie. From the presentation and from what my cousins say: \"Oh my goodness.\"",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to give fewer stars this time. It wasn't incredibly busy and there were ample empty tables, yet we were placed at a table that we shared with the water servers. It felt a little awkward and we kept feeling them bump it. Plus, I just kind of wondered why we were chosen to sit there. Kind of an ambiance-destroyer.  The food... was alright. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had in my life (like last time) and was really rare around the outside. I'm not even sure how that's possible, but I had to pick it off my medium-well burger. The fries weren't crisp, although they seemed fresh. It just wasn't special. I recall last time I wanted us to try and finish everything on our plates because it was so good.   My hubby had a steak and asparagus. He enjoyed it well enough, but we both think we'd rather go to a real steak house instead.   It's difficult not to expect something exceptional when you come to a celebrity chef restaurant.",

At this price point and with Gordon Ramsey's name on it (which is ironic, seeing as how much of a stickler Ramsey is concerning restaurant's serving frozen food), I would have expected at least hand-cut chips and fresh fish.   My meal was not bad, but was the equivalent quality of a TGIFriday's. Please save your money and go elsewhere if you want a quality meal for the price point.  I'm giving two stars because of the waitstaff; we had an excellent waiter who perhaps should be working at another restaurant that serves fresh, high-quality food.",

I love Gordon Ramsay and the food did not disappoint! I ordered the cheddar beef burger (with bacon) and it was very filling--I was an extreme fan of the garlic aioli that came with the fries! The braised short rib was also very flavorful and melts in your mouth. The deviled eggs were also delicious.   The dish that was the most lackluster was the lobster mac & cheese. It tasted like kraft mac & cheese and there was barely any lobster, and was not quite worth its $25. The group pretty much enjoyed their meal. The food also didn't take too long to come out.   Forgive me, for I forgot our waiters name, but he was very lively, attentive and entertaining to talk to! He made our dinner that much more enjoyable.   This is a great spot for dinner with a pretty diverse menu and does not make too much of a dent in your wallet when it comes to Vegas and a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I would suggest making a reservation!",

    "text": "With Chef Gordon Ramsay's name attached, you can expect to spend more for the same type of food as you would get anywhere else.  I'll start by saying that I KNOW I'm not the target audience.  I'm a vegetarian (a real vegetarian - no meat of any kind) but my husband isn't.  For this reason, when we go to Vegas, I've taken him to Ramsay's Burger place, Pub, and Steak house.  I'm sure we'll visit the Fish and Chips place sooner than later.  This is my second time visiting the Pub & Grill.  We first went a few years ago, right after \"Scott\" won Hell's Kitchen.  I got the lobster mac & cheese without lobster and my husband got the Fish and Chips.  Shortly after, my husband got pretty sick but there wasn't a way to pinpoint if it was food-related or a delayed hangover, which we know he gets.    We went for round two this trip.  We started with a flight of UK beers and a pint each of Innis and Gunn.  For those beer-fans out there, that was Bass, Boddingtons, I&G and New Castle.  The I&G is the \"original\" one and although the rum-cask is better, it's still delicious.  Then we went to order our food.  The prices have nearly doubled since it opened!  I bought my husband the exact same meal last time and now it's $30!  For Fish and Chips!  I got the beet salad for a whopping $18.  For beets, lettuce, and goat cheese.  I felt like it should have sat on a bet of poker chips.  I liked my salad and my husband loved his Fish and Chips.  We didn't over drink the night before and were totally healthy after our meal.  Because I've had it before and because it's amazing, we got the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  It's served with ice cream on top and not the ice cream butter stick you'll see at Gordon Ramsay Steak but lord is it delicious.  If the prices weren't so high, this would become a staple lunch place during our routine Vegas trip but I nearly dropped $100 on this meal and I literally had a salad and some beer.  I'm usually the cheap date since I don't eat meat but again... $18 for the salad.    I'm sure Chef Ramsay is not hurting monetarily so it would be nice if the prices were only slightly ridiculous.  Then again... it's Vegas.  Note: The service was awesome.  Our waiter was great. I wish the music was a little better.  It sounded a little clubby which didn't match and ambiance.",

Additionally, other people in our party got the lamb, fish and chips, and the salmon and all of them were fantastic.

Two thumbs down to our server whom, at times, made us feel like we weren't even there. He was so inattentive and disregarding - I'd like to say I forgot his name, but the dude didn't even introduce himself. He seemed focused on other people, giving the feeling of someone looking through you as if you ceased to exist.   A mixed thumb up for their Beer Braised Short Ribs. Unreasonably priced and it wasn't as tender as one would expect - The flavor screamed & howled, 'Puuub'.. And rightfully so, 'cause we were in one. Nothing exciting here, it seemed to lack flavor all together. A tad chewy and bland would describe this dish best. What WAS good was the potato puree. It lasted all of 1 minute as did the vegetables which were just okay.    Two thumbs down for the Crispy Calamari. It was more soggy and flimsy than crispy, which is disappointing when you want that snap and crunch. The fresh dill tartar sauce was actually tasty, just wish we had something other than the calamari to dip in it!   Shared a wedge salad that was straightforward. They didn't overdose the thing with blue cheese nor vinaigrette and were rather generous w/ the bacon. Fresh bites of this wedge salad overpowered the emotional depressant disguised as the Beer Braised Short Ribs. Sad, a salad won us over and it wasn't all that!  Toss our table next to the outer railing, where drunks, kids and families stroll by and stare at you and your food.. we've now created an all around unpleasant experience.   At least I went to a Gordon Ramsey eatery, though, we were highly disappointed.",

Also got the Pickle garden, probably the best pickles I've ever had (and I had a few in my life!).

But it wasn't too bad considering the amount of people that were there to eat. I had the fish and chips, and they were great! It was more food than I could eat in one sitting. The decor in the restaurant was lovely. Set the atmosphere just right.",

Service unfortunately was not good.  We sat at bar, 3 bartenders and all of them ignored us.  I eventually got their attention and they all thought the other was looking after us.  One guy took our order and made our first round of cocktails but then had to work the other side of bar.   I can't remember his name but he was great.  Anyway I love Gordon Ramsey's restaurants and his food is worth it.  Pricey but who cares when you're on vacation!",

It was way too much like a bad episode of Hell's Kitchen, with a FAT bill at the end.   We actually went out later and had a great late dinner.   Very disappointed.",

Sat there for 30 minutes and did not even have a server come over to greet us or at least say \"I will be with you shortly\".  Completely ignored.  Apparently, this is not uncommon at this restaurant as the people sitting next to us said that is how it was for them too.  I could tell that the table next to them were annoyed as well and had been waiting a long time to be greeted.  After 30 minutes we got up and left and went to Spago for a great meal.  I expect more from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant as this is something I would expect from any restaurant.",

The food and service were both average at best.   - I ordered a pint of Boddington's (draught) which should have been $8. When the bill came it was $11. I asked the server why it was $11 and he said because it was a 20 oz. I am still trying to figure out how they squeezed 20 oz's of Boddington's into a pint glass. Hmmm....  - My wife ordered a diet Pepsi and it was $4. Wow!   - I ordered the Chicken Curry. It took about 25 minutes to come out and when it arrived the portion wasn't the biggest, the sauce was good, the rice was fine, but the chicken was undercooked (pink). Definitely not worth the $24 price tag.  Would I go back? No.",

Mr. Ramsay, you need to spend some time at this place; it has your name on it and if your shows are real then you would be ashamed of this place.  My wife and I had a reservation at 8:30.  We showed up at 8:25 and were seated immediately.  By 8:35 we had ordered and had our beers were on the way.  Her onion soup and my tomato salad show up at about 8:40, along with the complimentary bread.  The soup and salad were outstanding.  We drink our beers, and talk, and wait, and wait, and wait and wait.  The waiter came by at 9:20, the only time he came by, to offer his apologize saying the kitchen was backed up due to large groups and our food was up next.  (My problem why?)  That was interesting considering the side of the restaurant we were on was half empty.  He did not offer to refill our nearly empty beers or water too.  At 9:45, I was ready to leave, but low and behold, our waiter reappears with our food.  My wife and I both ordered the Mix Fillet, with Yukon gold potatoes and sauteed mushrooms as the sides.  Well, the steak was lukewarm, the pork was room temperature, and the mushrooms were room temperature and the egg on top was not fully cooked.  But the potatoes were good and so were the two shrimp that come with the mixed fillet.  My wife and I were both ticked, asked a bus boy and another waitress to see the manger, who shows up 10 minutes later.  Mark the manager offers us a free desert, which we decline and I ask for the bill, letting him know this was the worst dining experience we have had in Las Vegas and will be telling all of our guest, friends, family, and coworkers about it.  He offers to comp us a dinner and asks if we want to make that reservation now.  We flatly say no; I don't want to waste another attempt at a meal at this place given all the great places to eat in Las Vegas.  We finally left at 10:00 and when we rolled into the hotel we had some fruit and ice cream which were more satisfying.",

He said yes and then went to ask how much they were since he didn't know when I asked. That's fine. Unfortunately it took him about 15 minutes to come back with the info. It was $10, so I rather ordered a glass of sparkling. Then we ordered our food. Deviled eggs as appetizer, tomato sandwich and shepherd's pie as entrees. The time we ordered our food was the last time we saw our waiter (until he brought the bill). The entrees came about 20 min later - but no appetizer. Our waiter walked by a few tables from us about five times - but looking in the other direction the whole time. He never came by to see if we were okay. It really seemed like he could not care less. The place was not busy at all - everywhere were waiters and hostesses standing around. I got up to go to the bar and ask for salt and pepper. Then finished the meal. The food was basic and okay. The service was just awful.  So when he brought the bill, I finally got a chance to tell our waiter that we never got the appetizer. All he said was that we weren't charged for it and pointed to the bill. Ridiculous. Don't go there. They don't treat you like they want your business - at all.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try out the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill since we are local fans of his.  We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.  We didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.  I ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said \"yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente\", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.  I had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more \"downstairs\".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.    Long story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dum-dums in the great rhubarb/peach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on.",

There were FIVE long legged girls working the hostess counter but only saw THREE waiters in the entire restaurant.  And it wasn't lack of experience.

We waited a good 20 minutes before anyone came to greed us. 30 more seconds and I was ready to walk out - wish I kinda wish I had. Again took the server forever to bring our drinks. Didn't even bring the basket of bread until AFTER our main entree already came (although the bread tasted good, unfortunately it was too late for it). I had a salad which was ok. My fiance had the burger which he said \"sucked\". His entree plate had a little container that was supposed to have ketchup in it but it was empty. Took them another 5 mins to bring that out... Just not what you are looking for sitting at a restaurant. You want to relax and have a good time. Not spend the entire night waiting on your service. I could tell the people sitting at table next to us were having the same issues - their eyes were wondering around looking for the waiters. When the check came, we didn't bother paying by card, just left some cash and got out! Disappointed.",

    "text": "We stopped here after seeing Jerry Seinfeld and as we expected there was a wait, and it would be an hour. We returned about 40 minutes later and the friendly hostess remembered us and had our table ready.  The dining room was very dark. I had asked our waitress what kind of beers were available and she put an iPad at the table to scroll through and walked away.  It was a bit awkward since she didn't tell me if I was to follow the directions and select my choice, or if she was to do that.  She was a bit slow to return, but was very knowledgable of the menu and our drinks arrived quickly.  I ordered the Yorkshire Fish and Chips and my son had the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp.  We were then served warm soft pretzels with a cheese spread and a mini loaf of bread with whipped butter. Honestly, I could have just had the pretzels and been perfectly happy.  Our meal arrived and my son's shrimp were huge. Usually I'm worried they won't be flavorful when they are so jumbo, but these were great. Cooked just right, and I didn't try the sauce they were in, but he loved it all.  The fish and chips were very good. Nothing extraordinary, but I did notice they were less oily than most. The tartar sauce was the best I've had, and I don't usually care for tartar sauce. I eagerly tried what I thought was cocktail sauce in the other ramekin and was disappointed that it was just ketchup.  I really wished there was malt vinegar offered for my fries, but by the time anyone was available for me to ask, I was already too full to be able to eat them, so I didn't bother.  Even though our sever was slow, she was very friendly and I assume that the disorganized atmosphere was due to it just being open a few days.  The prices were in line with most Vegas casino dining. We would eat there again.",

    "text": "We've eaten here twice so far (both times selecting from the grill menu) and each experience has been different. Speaking to others that have dined here, it seems that your experience depends a lot on the server that you get. Both times the food was outstanding, but our first visit was somewhat dulled by the lackluster performance of our server.  Our first visit was a weekday afternoon. We arrived just before 5:00 and it wasn't that busy--plenty of empty seats. We were told it would be about 15 minutes--strange since there were plenty of tables available. The hostesses are dressed in some sort of strange/tacky newsprint style dress that really isn't flattering. It seemed like everyone except the hostesses were busy--they were mostly standing around at the front kiosk chatting with each other.  It only took about 5 minutes to find us a table. The waiter stopped by after a few minutes, dropped off an iPad, and told us to order our drinks through it. No problem, except that it's for alcoholic drinks only and Brenda wanted an iced tea. BTW, you don't order off the iPad, you just browse--what a waste of a perfectly good paperweight. Brenda ordered the Braised Pork Belly with Sauteed Asparagus and I had the Filet Mixed Grill with sides of Creamed Spinach and Smashed Fingerling Potatoes. No starters, but we did snack on the delicious pretzel bread with butter and a cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was nothing spectacular, but the bread was warm and soft and went great with the English butter they brought out.   From the time we placed our order until the food arrived was about 20 minutes.  Brenda's iced tea finally arrived after the meal was served. The pork belly was delicious--just the right amount of crispiness without being overdone. The asparagus was done to perfection as well. The lemon zest and thyme went perfectly with the sweetness of the asparagus. I had pork belly with my meal, but it just wasn't the same as Brenda's. It was a smaller piece and it seemed it was cooked just a bit too long. Still had the good flavor, but it was just a bit dry. The filet was OK, nothing to rave about, but at least when I ordered it mid-rare, it came that way. The shrimp weren't bad, but I just don't think you can get really fresh, good shrimp in Las Vegas. For me, the stars of the meal were the two sides. The creamed spinach with stilton cheese was perfectly seasoned and really complimented the flavor of the pork belly. The fingerling potatoes had black truffle with small chunks of British double cream. I could have eaten two servings of these.   We finally got to see our waiter again when he brought us the check. He didn't ask if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink. Small tip for this bozo.  All in all, it wasn't a bad experience. The food was as good as we expected, but the front of house staff turned what should have been an enjoyable dining experience into a mediocre one.  Our second visit was much better than the first. We made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday evening to take our friends out for dinner. We were greeted warmly and waited less than a minute for the next available hostess to take us to our table.. It was a nice table away from the bustle of the casino with deep, comfortable chairs. Our waiter was there almost immediately and we were given the menus along with the useless iPad.  We placed our drink orders and before they were there our waiter was ready to take our order.  This visit we had two orders of the Braised Beef Cheek, one Fish and Chips, and I ordered the Grilled Rack of Lamb, replacing the olive oil crushed potatoes the great fingerling potatoes I had last time. Since we passed on starters, we continued snacking on the bread while we waited for the food to arrive. Very busy this night, but the staff didn't seem to be as disorganized as during our first visit.  Like the last trip, the food was amazing and as before, Brenda picked the better meal. The beef cheeks simple melted in your mouth and the sauce was so rich and tasty, I wanted to dip some of my lamb rack into it. The plate of fish and chips was huge. The batter was crispy without overcooking the fish and the tarragon tartar sauce complimented it well. My lamb rack was cooked perfectly to a medium rare with a nice sear on the outside. The rosemary lamb sauce was tasty without having that overpowering rosemary flavor or odor. All during the dinner, the staff was attentive, refilling our drinks and water glasses. We definitely didn't suffer through the poor service we had the last time around.  This trip we all had dessert and each picked something different to try. Steph had the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle which she enjoyed, but couldn't finish because of her large portion of fish and chips. Joe had the Spotted Dog (a bread pudding) which was tasty and quickly devoured. Brenda, who loves rhubarb, had the Rhubarb Cobbler. I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I first had at GR Steak, and it was just as good and a few bucks cheaper.",

The host took us right away after realizing we had a bride to be in the midst and did so with the biggest smile on her face! The restaurant had great energy, good decor and a was a fun place to hang out with my girls. I ordered the Goodbye Blue Sky drink to start, which was ever so yummy! For dinner I had the braised short ribs. They were extremely tender and the side of truffle fries were to die for. Last but not least, I couldn't leave without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I first saw Chef Ramsey make on Masterchef and I must say, it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. We got it to go and I ate it on the way to the car. My feet were hurting like no other, but once I took a bite of that pudding, all of my worries just floated away and I was on cloud 9. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in Vegas for this dessert. My meal was roughly $80, which is pretty steep, but it was well worth it!",

Inside was buzzing with big groups, so looks like a good spot to bring a big party. It was loud and had good energy. Overall would recommend, make reservations, it was busy.",

    "text": "We grabbed a last minute reservation at the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.  There weren't many places available on short notice, so this seemed like a good option.  I had pan seared salmon which had a nice sear and good flavor.  It wasn't bad, but nothing I would rush back for.  My three dining companions all ordered the beer braised short ribs.  Their feedback ranged from mediocre to 'awful'.  The risotto was consistently undercooked and the meet was quite fatty (even by short rib standards).    Overall this restaurant might work in a pinch, but for the price (entrees ran around $30), there are numerous better options on the strip.",

Daisy was my server she is so sweet knows the menu very well and suggested great items I didn't even really have to look at the menu I had some fruity cocktail it was very refreshing and her server asst. helped by cleaning items off table and refilling our waters. I got the ribeye medium it was so good ! I ate all it's served with potatoes and my boyfriend had the chicken pot pie chicken was very juicy and gravy was top notch! She suggested the sticky toffee to top it all off it's the best dessert I have ever had I still dream about it served with a vanilla ice cream. I will be back !!!! Thank you daisy for making my birthday special",

If you eat here, know that some of the best food on the menu is some of the more humble options, like the sandwiches, etc. I would prefer the blt to the steak. Also, GET DESSERT! It is so good.

IMO, the food was, ehhh. IMO I was a bit disappointed. we had a B-day girl in our party and the staff just dropped off the desert and left. no showman ship at all. The desert was really delicious. I hate to say it, the $20+ burger i got was ehh. nothing to rave about. i would not recommend this restaurant considering the price vs taste.",

Reading the reviews - the Fish and Chips are \"AMAZING,\" I am not sure where these people have had fish and chips before, or maybe the Chef forgot to drain the grease from the fish before plating - in any case - not impressed. Two of the Three Filets were a bit overcooked, and the Third Fillet was dripping with grease, which left a pool into my Mushy Peas.  Service - meh. Typical Vegas, seat you when available, give you a beverage menu, return 10 mins later, take the beverage order, and if you are not ready to order your grub, then be ready to wait at least another 10-20 minutes to order when your beverages arrive. At one point I am pretty sure our Server was too concerned with her co-workers conversations instead of our table with empty glasses and dirty plates.  Reccomendations if feeling the need to experience - the soft warm pretzel appetizer (best spicy mustard!), and the Pear Cider was a winner too!  Our Bill for a party of Two (we shared) - Pretzel App, Fish and Chips, and 1 Pear Cider = $52.00 Not worth it.",

It was not up to par from what I expected it to be. I will start off with the server. First of all, he was not very friendly and I felt the attention was not there. Took 15 minutes to come back and ask us what we would like to order after he brought our drinks, considering there were only 2 other customers he was tending to. Once we received our meal I asked for a second beer, he replied he would get that for me..10 minutes later, I reminded him about my beer, his answer \"yes I know, I need to go get it\" Really? I am dropping at least $100 for our meal and you answer me like that? The burger was good but not excellent for being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I was expecting a big juicy burger, but it was compared to maybe a Red Robin burger, and I am being generous. I will not come back here again only because the service was so bad.",

Nothing is worse than fish where the breading is thicker than the fish.  Biting through 1/4\" of soggy breading to get to 1/8\" of fish is disgusting.  I would not feed this to the people in Guantanamo Bay...this would be torture!!!!  On top of that I had to pay $30.00 for this!  Perhaps someone should yell at Gordon Ramsey and call his food s**t like he does on television.  Stay away from this place.",

For example we had a burger and it was supposed to come with a dill pickle and pepperchini garnish. All they said was they ran out and that's it. I thought most restaurants would substitute something for that. It's a $20 burger that's worth $9 after this experience. Also the wait took an hour wait. Will not come back. Gordon better come back and fix this.",

He also recommended that I check in to get the sticky toffee pudding.  I'd recommend all the food I got, it was really delicious. The Caesar salad was perfect with white anchovies, fresh shaved parmasean, creamy dressing, crispy housemade croutons & fresh romaine lettuce. The shrimp & lobster roll was a little on the small side, but was an appetizer after all, but all in all very good, fresh chunks of lobster & shrimp with some celery and mayo on a buttery roll with a few micro greens on the top. The sticky toffee pudding really topped off my meal, really meant for at least 2 people, but really decadent and caramelly.",

She asked us about any allergies , if we have been to the place before , as we didn't she asked us how we were enjoying Vegas then she started with the drinks and our food . I had the burger and my wife had the tomato soup and fish and chips ! Just as expected , tender fish, fresh fresh fries and of course the burger was on point.

Oh, and definitely recommend the Jumbo Shrimp appetizer. My husband wanted something on the lighter side after the James Taylor concert (two thumbs up). He wanted the Roasted Tomato Soup with a grilled cheese. Our server, Taylor (he rocks twice), pointed out that the toasted cheese and basil bread was their take on a grilled cheese. LOVED IT!!!",

Two pieces of lightly battered fish. Cooked just right and very good. The not so good, chips (steak fries) not hot and soggy. Also came with some peas. Two of the three of us received soupy peas with a minty flavor. My other friend received peas that were the consistency of mud. Then we got the bill. $30 each for two pieces of batter fried cod, some soggy steak fries and some inconsistent minty flavored peas. It was a long hot day and the three of just had water. The bill for the three of us? $125 with the tip. Like I said the fish was very good but the sides? Not what I'd expect at Gordon Ramsay.",

    "text": "Well, I was ready for anything but wanted to see for myself whether the famed Gordon Ramsay could produce Fish & Chips that would justify a high price for them.  I received that and more!  \"Pricey\" is an appropriate term here.  After three appetizers, an order of Onion Soup, and two orders of Fish & Chips, an Iced Tea, tax, and tip, I walked out with my wallet $165 lighter.  But it was $165 well spent.  I rate restaurants mainly on food taste and according to their type--not on how costly they might be.  And for a pub & grill, Gordon Ramsey delivered great quality and taste on everything I sampled.  Plus, the atmosphere was pub-like and comfortable sitting in a sunken booth with regal sword-like silverware in a well-decorated dining room.  Service, too, was good and very accommodating of special requests for a very busy restaurant.  We began with a truly Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail with a Citrus Crunch, Horseradish, and tantalizing reddish Cocktail sauce.  The shrimp was meaty, perfectly cooked, and delicious.  Deviled Eggs served with bits of chives, tomato, bacon, and tiny Red Onion and White Onion squares contained beautifully whipped up yolks,  The individual egg halves taken as a whole yielded a pleasant crunchy flavor that offered a fine prelude to what was to come.  And Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, with Gruyere, English Cheddar, and Parmesan, at $25 a pop delivered a fine shareable and soothing side for me and Diane even though the dish was presented as an appetizer.  The three conjoined cheeses melted harmoniously over the cooked macaroni, and flowed over good-sized chunks of tasty lobster meat.  Since it was on the menu I had to also try the Sweet English Ale Onion Soup, which was quite cheesy, mellow, and without any noticeable hint of alcohol.  It will join my list of memorable French Onion Soups even though it was technically British rather than French.     My two long lengths of blonde battered cod with Mushy Peas, lemon juice, malt vinegar, and a superior homemade Tartar Sauce were served hot and were simply excellent, cooked just right with steaming and flaky flesh inside the lightly golden batter.  And the thick log-like \"chips\" were quite tasty as well.  Although I didn't try it, a friend dining with us pronounced the golden-crusted Chicken, Kale & Bacon Pot Pie with Marjoram & Creme Fraiche, & Vegetables the best pot pie she had ever tasted.  That is now on my \"to try\" list!  So a return visit will definitely be made once my wallet has been replenished.",

Our waiter was very charismatic and took great care of us. He even hooked us up with ordering Scottish eggs that were not on the menu. The steak was cooked to perfection. The Shepherd Pie delicious. The pork belly was a delicate sweet pork with a tasty acidic mustard sauce that my daughter loved! The price is what you would expect for the quality of it and well... it is Gordon Ramsay in Vegas! I recommend coming early to avoid huge wait times. Definitely highly recommended... We will be back many more times in the future!",

I ordered this sandwich expecting it to be good, and it exceeded my expectations to the max. The flavors of the breading on the chicken will throw your taste buds for a loop... you'll love every bite of it. In addition to the chicken itself, the bacon aioli and shallot marmalade accompanied the meat ever so perfect. Seriously guys, this chicken sandwich is the real deal.  It also comes with a side of pub chips that add a great crunch to the dish.   To top off the meal, I ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert and that too was absolutely delicious. You also get it served to you in True Vegas fashion ;) (see video)    The atmosphere here is fun and lively, especially because it's located in the middle of the casino. The prices are pretty standard for Vegas but you can definitely count on getting your moneys worth. Do yourself a favor and head over to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill for a great time and an even better chicken sandwich! Trust me, you'll love it!!",

The beet salad -- I ended up biting down on something hard that almost chipped my tooth see picture -- it was either a hard pine nut or something however not roasted nor edible I thought I was eating something other then a salad. Also the ridicule salad part ( mix with arugula ) was very sandy or harder then normal. However the beet part and the goat cheese part along with the dressing was nice.   The order was beer battered fish -- cough 29.00$ I shure Gordon you don't offer that price in your England restaurants. was good   My dad got a medium temp burger that was done on the rarer side - witch put him off . however ingredients mixed nicely.   Mine well -- ( ale pie ) the filling was amazing however I was thinking it would be more like the shepherds pie with piped mashed potatoes like Gordon Ramsey always to have tips on his other then his hair lol. But the filling aspect was great however the mashed made it feel more like a meat chicken pot pie taste .. ( dont get me wrong it was good I am not shure the topping is wright. )   Spotted dc ( yes I abbreviated it ) lol . was great -- I know they stress on that.   Overall 3 meals a little confusion with seating etc. -- Also we where set back in the part with tvs for the game -- Witch was blaring -- I am 30 not old - couldn't even hear our server   I would be willing to give it another review at a latter date - due to fact I love hells kitchen. but will be back since I am a local know well obiv with over 80 something reviews in las vegas.",

I don't understand how someone so opinionated about others have such a crappy restaurant. It's really a joke.",

    "text": "So my husband and I were on a date here the night before he deployed to Afghanistan. We were really excited as we've been fans of Gordon Ramsey for quite some time. There was a 30 minute wait (no problem) and actually built the anticipation. Somewhere with this kind of wait MUST be awesome. We were texted when our seat was available. The decor was nice and the uniforms were fun.   We ordered the Roasted Tomato soup and Truffle fries. The Tomato Soup was great, not quite as good as we just had in London, but thats okay. Truffle fries were great. We also ordered a mixed beverage with Bourbon and a glass of wine. Mixed drink was really tasty.   Because the appetizers were so good, we were even more excited for our entrees. We ordered The NY Strip and the Scottish Salmon. What a disappointment. The NY Strip was medium-medium well when we ordered medium rare. It was INCREDIBLY chewy. We've had better steaks at chain steakhouses (no exaggeration). And the sides: the asparagus was so overcooked it was actually mushy and there were just a few tiny potatoes. The salmon came with lentils and was SO SO SO bland. Like SO bland. Our water was never refilled and when my husband got his steak, the did not bring a steak knife and had to get up himself to go find one after waiting quite a while for someone to bring one.   Overall, I was so disappointed and feel like I wasted my last night with my husband at a subpar establishment. We would have gotten better food from a Macaroni Grill.   With a name like Gordon Ramsay plastered on the front of the menu, you expect to leave with a smile on your face.  OH! And we were sitting in front of a tv that was playing a show where surgery was taking place. Nothing better than chewing on bland salmon and looking at a human organ in a plastic bag on a 60 inch tv. Excellent.",

The food, drinks, ambience and service was absolutely perfect the first time round. Head chef and Hell's Kitchen winner Scott even came out and chatted and took a picture with us.  This visit however, was a disaster in terms of service. Our server didn't greet us, placed our cutlery on our table in a rather rough manner and even tried to cheat us by adding additional items on our bill. When questioned, he just said, 'Oh I'm so sorry, let me get that rectified.' He did not seem surprised or shocked but instead, expected it. Doesn't this mean that it was deliberate all this while and that he tried to get away with it? The second time he presented the bill to us, there were still discrepancies on it and again, he has the same reaction like it was done on purpose.  It's a shame that this place has hired servers like this. My first experience was so perfect that I would have recommended it to anyone. Unfortunately, it has been tarnished by this bad episode. Such a shame.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here to treat our uncle to dinner because he was visiting. We had the following:  Appetizers: 1/2 dozen Lolli-pop chicken wings $12 Scotch Egg $11  Entrees: Chopped salad $16 12 oz Grilled Ribeye $39 12 oz grilled NY Strip $37  Sides: Forest Mushrooms $11 Sauteed Brussel Sprouts $11  Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding $11  Drink Innis & Gunn $8  This meal was probably one of the best meals I've had in vegas. The scotch egg appetizer was pretty good with a nice bbq sauce and it came with marinated vegas. The chicken wings were not actually wings but drumettes. The sauce was AMAZING! It tasted like a honey, bbq, sweet chili, and hot sauce all in one. This is probably the appetizer I've in vegas. I would have to put this in my top appetizer list with Carson Kitchen's Bacon Jam.   Now to the entrees. My wife said her salad was good with a lot of texture going on with the chicken, chickpeas, avocados, shrimp, etc. My ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium. I liked how there were 3 sauces you could choose from (i forgot the names) but the one I got tasted like an au jus. My uncle said his strip was great and he got a gravy looking sauce. The sides were great too. The pork belly that was sauteed with the brussel sprouts were melt in you mouth...so bad yet so good.  The sticky toffee pudding is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. That too was WINNAHS! (excuse my Hawaiian accent). It came with a toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It didn't taste as sweet as I thought it would be. I was so curious to know why that i actually researched it afterwards and found out that this dessert is made with dates and brown sugar.   My uncle and I also tried the Innis $ Gunn beer. Our waiter, John, said its Gordon Ramsay's favorite beer. We both thought it was very smooth with a nice foam on top. It paired well with our meal.  Overal, I would definitely come back again. The ambience was great and we were lucky enough to sit next to the tvs. Kudos to our waiter John for the great service.  The chicken appetizer and the sticky toffee pudding were definitely the stand outs. I've  been to his Burger resto in planet hollywood and now this one. Two down, one more GR resto to go!",

    "text": "In short, i got my meal for free.  Ordered the beef burger with bacon. The waitress even repeated it before leaving the table. The guy serves it and mumbles what could have been either \"hamburger\" or \"lamburger\". I look and no bacon and some white creamy sauce instead of bacon with chopped lettuce and cheddar. So i call her over and ask if it's really the beef burger with bacon. She says it looks like it but they forgot the bacon. (Put them side by side and you can easily tell by the topping that it's not).  3-4 minutes later i get a new burger with proper topping and bacon. Cut it in half and notice it's quite pink but i did order medium instead of medium well as i figured the meat at a Gordon Ramsay should be top quality.  After a couple of bites, someone else comes to deliver my burger...yes, they sent two out !  So i eat half and only a couple of bites on the outside are good, the rest was too raw for me. When i look into the second half of the burger you can clearly see it's very raw.  Show the waitress and she says she will talk to the manager. A couple of minutes later i see him coming towards me but he walks by. A minute or two later he comes over and says he went to the wrong table and started saying sorry to them about the burger, they said it was great why are you sorry ?  So he starts his i'm sorry speech and says it's on him. And asks that i try them again the next time i'm in town...right, with all the restaurants in a one mile radius, why would i bother taking the long trek into the abyss of Cesar's Palace for that ?  What a complete useless bunch ! I left a tip for the waitress, but now regret doing so, she doesn't know the difference in looks between the two meat burgers they serve ?!?  Gordon would have been livid if he actually worked there and not just sell his name. Shame, i rather like Gordon and his devotion to food.  Now lets hope i won't get sick from the raw meat.  Save yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere.",

The fish was small, the menu ala carte.  Lemon and malt vinegar had to be requested after the food was delivered.  Meh.  The service rode the line of slow-attentive.  Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and we were left for long periods unattended.   I was sad that no pub burger was in sight on the menu.  We were not offered bread while we waited.",

Given our affinity for them,  and the Gordon Ramsay name, we wanted to try this one.   The atmosphere is decidedly non-traditional for a British Pub,  with the majority of it open to the casino floor. If that's a deal breaker for you,  be warned.  In my view,  it's Vegas and we didn't come to look, we came to eat and drink. It didn't disappoint on that front.   We shared a starter of Toads in the Hall, which was delicious. The drink selection was extensive. While we're not usually beer people, our waiter recommended a brown ale called Innis and Gunn that was fantastic.   We both had fish and chips for our entrees and it was some of the best British style fish and chips I've had in the states. I highly recommend it.   It is pricey, but it's on the strip in Vegas, that's the norm. Even if you're not a player,  sign up for the Total Rewards player's card,  as you do get a menu discount.",

Note this was for game 7 of the 2014 World Series, so I could assume the staff just wanted to watch rather than have to serve that night.  If your place has pub in its name and numerous televisions you should expect people may get the idea they can enjoy a game there.    I thought it may have been because we asked to switch tables (something I don't do normally) in order to see the game, but the table next to us has the same problem with the server.",

    "text": "\"As filming [Kitchen Nightmares] comes to a close on the latest series of Kitchen Nightmares I've decided to stop making the show,\" Ramsay wrote on his website. \"I've had a phenomenal 10 years making 123 episodes, 12 seasons, shot across 2 continents, watched by tens of millions of people and sold to over 150 countries. It's been a blast but it's time to call it a day.\"  DON'T STOP TOO SOON... you have one more restaurant to fix up... this one!  Worst Gordon Ramsay experience we've ever had (and the first bad experience so maybe that's why I'm taking it so hard).  1.  Our experience started as the hostess walked us through a reasonably open restaurant: past the \"patio\", past the bar, past the really nice booths, and all the way to the very back of the \"family room\"... where one might imagine the staff eats.  What's up with that; do we not fit your preferred demographic or is there some other reason why you did this to my family?  I'm curious; really.  2.  Waitress seems to have trained at the local Denny's.  If you were here, Chef Ramsay you'd tell that 'fat cow\" to EffOff.  Ordered drinks and food.  Food got delivered (shockingly fast), then the drinks.  Not relaxing at all.  3.  Fish and chips... let's talk about this please.  I'm in no way qualified to tell you how to cook, but these fish and chips were fish and fries.  I've had plenty of fish and chips in the UK, both in pubs and from small shops... and once from a place so small they didn't even have electric refrigeration.  Really... fries pretending to be chips on a plate of fish and chips???  I've seen you rip people new a-holes for misrepresenting food like this.  Oh... and we never tasted the mushy peas.  The expeditor forgot them, the runner didn't notice that the expeditor forgot them, and the waitress... well she was out to pasture and didn't notice much of anything.  4.  Shepard's Pie... let's chat some more.  Served \"bare naked\" it was a disappointing sight from the moment it landed on the table.  Mash was barely browned and no garnish at all.  No visual appeal and no olfactory appeal either.  As I ate all I could hear was you saying \"season, season, season\" as you prepare to send a MasterChef contestant home for serving bland food.  Whoever the donkey is that cooked my pie... please ask him to return the apron and leave.  Please.  And those straight-sided dishes sure did make eating the mince and veg a frustrating experience.  5.  Manager was finally summoned.  I was unhappy.  He was polite and kind but had an \"excuse\" for almost everything.  Fries rather than chips: \"you can order real chips on the appetizer menu\" and when asked again \"well, this is a Ramsay-twist; Las Vegas twist on a pub.\"  WTF does that mean... that you can call chips fries because we're not in the UK?  I think not.  He did the best he could to make things right and comp'd a couple of desserts to make up for the missing mushy peas.  But days later all I can remember is that we didn't have the kind of experience we should have had.  6.  Oh, and let me not forget to mention... the table next to us was set for guests, but there were chips -- errr... fries, I mean -- on the floor, presumably from the last diner.  EVERYONE walked past them, over them, and past them again.  I had the pleasure of looking at squished fries on the floor as I ate my meal.  I know, I know it is my own fault: I looked (and looked again).  Manager verified that they were fries and not chips... then took 15 minutes to get them cleaned up.  But cleaned up they were... eventually.  7.  Now that I've vented my spleen let me compliment a few things:  salmon was very good.  The fish on the fish-and-fries was good too.  Desserts were excellent.  Please forgive me, Chef, for having such an attitude but it is you who inspire me and you who keeps bleating \"standards\"... and I totally agree.  Standards are everything and should be maintained at all times.  I only wish they were maintained for me during our visit to your PUB.",

I suppose I wasn't expecting much because it was about 11:00p and they were packed, but it was a really good experience. Firstly, I really love the way the restaurant is set up. So awesome to see different style tables and chairs. Everything from high tops, to couches, to stools and love seats around tables, very charming. Unfortunately we were seated at a high top table lol but that's ok because the atmosphere was great, lots of people at the bar, lots of good looking waitresses and bartenders, and our waitress was very sweet. I ordered the fish and chips, and my friend ordered the salmon and both were incredible. My fish was crispy and so tender on the inside, the plate came with seasoned potato wedges and mashed peas. The peas were very different, interesting taste but I liked them. My friend's salmon was thick and it melted in your mouth. They didn't have an extensive wine list but we made it work. Salmon plate was 36.00 and fish and chips was 30, add the wine and we spent over 100.00! But the portions were large and the food was great. I'd recommend this place!",

The four of us were sat on these couches that looked cool but were ultimately impractical and grew highly uncomfortable over the evening.   The service was spotty at best with much of the menu unavailable, some of which we didn't discover until after the order was put in. There were also no towels in the men's bathroom over the course of the meal which was especially disconcerting since the menu is mostly comprised of finger foods.   I was foolhardy enough to order the $30 fish and chips which paled against the dive-iest pub food in London or the US. No seasoning on the fish, chips undercooked to the point of hardness, and a price point that made each bite taste of regret and the feeling of being taken advantage of.   The night ended with one of our party needing to make a hasty exit due to some digestional challenges that my wife and I now share.   Save yourselves, friends.",

The goat cheese perfectly complimented the lamb. The fries and garlic butter were great too. My meal was absolutely delicious but it was really rich.  In the end, the portion size was too much for me and it felt like a waste. I could have probably split it with another person. Service was fine. We came in a party of three and were seated right away at arund 9:30 on a Saturday night.",

Our waiter was busy but nice enough to check in on us and make sure we got what we needed. We were impressed by the quickness in which our food got out. We had just ordered the wings and nachos which had a different take on flavors. It was good, but nothing that was very impressive. The prices were just too exorbitant I don't think we've ever paid $22 for a dozen wings. The nachos were like $15 or $16 and that seemed too high as well. I understand that this was on top of kettle chips and it was short ribs, but that was a bit crazy. I can appreciate the creativity but it comes with a cost. This also seems to be a popular spot for birthday celebrations and there were 2 right next to us, and we were here at like 9:45pm.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to eating here for literally months. I browsed the menu online and arrived expecting to be quite happy. Unfortunately, the best I can report is that I left full.   Our flight was delayed, causing my spouse and I to be about 30 minutes late for our reservation. Not a problem- they were able to seat us after a 10 minute wait. Unfortunately, after that we kept waiting. It took another 15 minutes to get water. 10 more minutes after that before our waitress arrived to take drink orders. We ended up placing our meal order at the same time, just to cut down on the delays.  As a starter, my son and I shared an order of the Warm Pretzels....which arrived stale and significantly less than warm. The accompanying cheese sauce was glorified velveeta. My entree, the Steak & Ale Pie was okay. The description said the pie contained \"root vegetables\" so I'd been eagerly anticipating a pie rich with steak, potatoes, parsnips, turnips...all those lovely British veg. But no...I got a basic stewed beef with a couple of sad little carrot bits, topped by a crust that left my mouth coated in lard/shortening film.   My spouse and son both ordered burgers and raved about them...but they both agreed that the fries reminded them of Burger King. Not what an English pub should aspire to emulate.  Overall? Horribly overpriced (we paid over $100 for 3 entrees, 2 apps and 3 sodas) mediocre food. Cannot recommend.",

My steak was chewy, hard to cut, and burnt on the outside. However, the inside was fine. Maybe if I had cut off the exterior entirely then I would've enjoyed it better. The mashed potatoes were bland. I guess that's good if you're sharing at a table of people with different taste buds - it gives you the choice to season it more on your own.   The service is mediocre. Although we liked the girl who was serving us (she was friendly and helpful), she didn't come by too often and the times that she did, we didn't have food on the table yet.   Overall, it was a whatever experience for me.",

The service was excellent and there were TVs everywhere. Our group started off with the calamari...excellently fried...crispy on the outside, not overcooked and chewy on the inside. Our entrees entailed 1. chicken, kale, and bacon pot pie, 2. butter chicken curry, 3. shepherd's pie, and 4. fish and chips. All of the food was excellent! My buddy was extremely surprised and pleased at how good the butter chicken curry (think indian curry) was good at an English pub. The rest of the table was pleased with their meal as well. The only downside is it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas so the prices are higher...example: $30 fish and chips. But work will end up paying for our meal so I'm glad we got to experience it. Would definitely stop in again!",

There's some factors that are out of the staffs control like; it was Friday at 6pm'ish and busy & it looked like there was a couple large groups they were dealing with.  But The whole atmosphere made me uncomfortable and anxious.  We were seated in a very awkward table in the doorway that left very little room for the waitstaff to move around and get to their computer and flatware.  My chair was bumped several times and I tried my best to scoot in.  The chairs were strange like they were bottomed out and really low where our knees are sticking up and the table is too high.  The staff was rearranging the floor plan or something...I've never seen so many empty chairs being slid back and forth around the restaurant- it was crazy - the staff pushing chairs all over and yanking on this room divider wall that was stuck in the tracks and screeching along inch by inch.  One of the waiters kept trying to take our plates every two minutes which made me feel nervous.  All I ate was the pork belly appetizer but I really didn't like it.  Maybe that's how it's supposed to be but it was really fatty and just not to my taste.  I can't blame them for that.  But as far as comfort and atmosphere goes, it was not good.  Too much commotion and bunched up tables to be able to relax.  I'm a local and was only there to get dinner before a show inside Caesar's- I wouldn't make a special trip for this place!",

    "text": "I was at their venue last night but just didn't have a chance to write out a review.  So, I'll just cut to the chase. I intend to rate it 4.5 stars, but kind of hard to swallow the .5, so, I'll leave it at 4 stars, due to couple reasons.  If I'm bringing a group of six adults for dinner after the CES convention week, I just assumed this will be a great place to experience the actual GR food. No to mention, two of my guests are GR fans, so, why not give it a try, right?  The overall food experience was good, I wish I could've said great! I first ordered the calamari as to share the appetizer, and the truffle fries, which I thought is a great way to start a meal. Especially if GR had been showing how crispy he likes to make them calamari. Well...I didn't expect it to have seen the calamari to have so many tendons, AND not being somewhat crispy as I'd had hoped for. A few of us tried it, it really turned out to be a bit soft and chewy. So, we had to send it back and ordered something else instead.  Anyways, aside to the bad calamari, the food we ordered were delicious, we had the burgers, and few of the folks ordered the steak. It was a lot of food, but we managed to finish.  Our server was friendly and super courteous, but perhaps they need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of their sections! Not a Ramsay standard, I'd say! ;) The booth we got sat in, the seats weren't wiped clean, the floors were dirty and not swept properly. I understand the concept is to be a pub and setting is to be as if we are to eat at a London pub...But, if we're to spend $45 on a Ribeyes, I'd consider that being a steakhouse, right?  So, aside to the chewy calamari and cleanliness, I do enjoy the rest of the food served after, as well the rest of the folks in my table.  #foodporn #cleanmuch #GordonRamsay #Standard #VegasRestaurant",

I had the Mac and cheese and lobster and shrimp rolls. I'd skip and max and cheese as is wasn't mind blowing or anything. The rolls were small but very fresh tasting. Our server was Adam aka Afro! He was really nice and personable and made us laugh! The sticky toffee pudding is AMAZING!!!",

We had the best meal we've had in a long time.  The hamburger was awesome and the black angus tenderloin was to die for.  They definitely redeemed themselves !",

And the lobster/shrimp mini rolls. Those were finished without any issues because they were delicious.   I ordered the Short Ribs. The portion of that short rib was beyond what I could imagine. I had no idea it was going to be a huge portion. It was lacking a little salt and was a little drier than i preferred but it was still delicious. It came with some cheddar mashed potatoes which I enjoyed. Probably one of the best mashed potatoes I have ever tried.   My girlfriend ordered the Scallops and she got 5 portions of Scallops with a succotash puree. She seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, I am glad I stopped at this location while casino-hopping. The food was amazing, the portion was good sized. The bill kinda sucked between 3 people but it was vegas and we did splurge a little lol.",

    "text": "We decided to do a Gordon Ramsay food tour in Vegas. This was our second stop. It's a little pricey, but the atmosphere and food more than justify the cost.  First, it's much more relaxed than the steakhouse. They seem to recommend business casual but I saw plenty of people in jeans there. They have TVs pretty much everywhere and the tables are nice and spaced out. I had a pot pie and my husband got the bangers and mash--both were delicious. The pub nachos were very rich and flavorful. Also: sticky toffee pudding!! Enough said about that.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is that while the food and atmosphere were good, none of it was AMAZING. Granted, the price point here is not on the same level as the steakhouse, but if I'm dropping $100 I would like the experience to at least be memorable. This was a good experience, but nothing I would crave or even need to experience again.",

Ordered the grilled lamb burger and my SO ordered something else.. forgot what it was, but it was pretty darn good too. Quality if top notch and service is friendly, quick and attentive. Serving sizes weren't bad, the decor is nice, and the way the food is set up is near perfect.  Cons: Price obviously lol. $30 for fish and chips and over $20 or something for the burger. You have to pay to play at restaurants like this in Vegas lol. If this were just some random joint then the prices of the food would have more of an impact on my rating.  Bottom line: Surprised this place has a low 3 stars on Yelp!. Oh well lol. I'll most likely be back, but give this place a try if you're around.",

    "text": "Of the 3 Gordon Ramsy establishments we tried, this one fell below expectations.  As a Yelp foodie first and foremost is taste, and that was definitely lacking for me.  Food: I got the Aline Chicken dish, the description sounded super flavourful but the dish fell flat.  Presentation was nice, when it came I was excited to try it, the chicken leg looked crispy, but it truly had no taste.  I've cooked tastier chicken myself.  The beans with parsnip as well lacked taste, so it was dry tasteless chicken on a lot of tastless beans with some chopped veggies for $29.  Not good value either.  My husband had the Sheppard's Pie, which he says was better than my dish but not amazing, $24.  Service: lacking in a sense, server did not recommend any \"most popular\" dishes, and maybe this is where the problem started because I may have ordered a so so dish to start.  What was annoying was we asked to split the bill, he forgot to, left, then started serving other ppl/stuff and forgot about our bill, then finally came back and stood there while we were paying.   This is annoying as I would think most restaurants train their staff to not stare while you pay.  It seems like this restaurant tries to do too much with the menue, ranging from steak to burgers to sandwhiches to pub food (pies, etc.), fish n chips, etc.  Suggest they scale down the menue and focus on making what is on a condensed menue super tasty to live up to the Gordon Ramsy name.  Overall, will not come back on my next travel and would not recommend.",

My cousin had the ribeye and it was more seasoned and had a better flavor. The service was slow and it took us 2 hours from the time we sat down until they brought us our checks Also we had a specialty cake and we were charged $3 per slice but they didn't cut or help serve the cake, for them to hold the cake which was a bit ridiculous since we spend over $60 per person here and we had 15 people I our party. If you have a choice for the price I would say skip the restaurant unless you really want a $15 burger. But hey it's Vegas!",

    "text": "Prior to flying to the US, I'd promised myself that I would try Gordon Ramsay's Burger joint and this one as well. I did the Ramsay burger on the 3rd day and loved it so the Pub & Grill was the one remaining.  We went for dinner there on the last night of our 4 nights in Vegas and I have to say, in all honesty, that I had a great experience. Alright alright, I am a fan of Chef Ramsay but you have to give credit to where credit's due. He knows how to structure his restaurants - the layout, decor, the way that everything is setup; it works!   Ramsay Pub & Grill has a bit of a retro/funky feel. It's not too formal but then again, it's not too casual either. Whether you're hanging out w/ friends over dinner or you're out on a date, it'll suit the occasion.   I really like the photo of Gordon and his bulldog Rumpole on the menu - pretty funny!  I had the Shepherd's Pie and it was really good. The bread and cheesy dipping appertizers were very nice and I also had a cocktail - not bad. I really wanted dessert however I was too full - that'll be for next time!  The waitress who looked after us was very nice.   You'll find Ramsay Pub & Grill at the entrance to the Palace Casino inside Caesars.. Check it out...",

    "text": "In a nutshell: over-priced and awful service. A month ago, I came here with 3 girlfriends. I had decent expectations. While waiting at the bar for a table, 3 drinks got returned from the dining area to our bartender (who seemed new). The the servers were bluntly rude to the bartender about the drinks right in front of us. It was uncomfortable and customers shouldn't be around when an employee is getting scolded. There was also a woman tending (who appeared to be training the bartender). She was snappy to him in front of us about checking our IDs after we had already been served (we are all nearing our 30's and he had indeed already checked all of our birthdays). She never smiled or acknowledged us. Again, it made us uncomfortable.  This woman took our tabs (as opposed to our bartender who had served us, laughed with us, been friendly, taken pictures, etc.) when it was time to sit at our table even though she had 0 communication with our party. She then shorted me money. It was a very small amount, but I was immediately irate because it had been an odd amount due to tax (I believe my total had been 5.36, I paid with $10) and I only got $4.50 in change back. I would understand if it was an odd amount, but I received 2 basic quarters. Nothing else. No odd pennies or nickels, just 2 quarters. It was CLEARLY wrong without even thinking about the math. It was pure laziness. She never even looked at us, just took our money and left.  I did not want to leave a tip for risk this woman would steal it (after she'd already taken $.14 of my own) and I couldn't find our bartender to tip him directly. I boldly circled my \"change due\" section on my receipt since after we paid the woman never returned to our side of the bar and my party was already at a table. If our nice bartender ever reads this, I'm sorry I didn't tip you. Once seated, it was very hot in our dining area. We were all sweating. Had the food made up for this, we could have looked past it.  I ordered french onion soup and it had (what I hope was) a chunk of rock solid bone in it. We couldn't identify it. Why would there be anything hard in french onion soup? It was super disappointing because the soup was great until then. My friend ordered sliders that were ok, slightly dry but ok. The other 2 ordered the same thing: the burger. One rare, the other medium. When they were delivered at the same time looking identical, one girl clarified with the food runner that they had each gotten the correct burgers to the correct person: she guaranteed they had. They were wrong. One bite in and each girl could tell they had the wrong one. They swapped, we were all friends, no big deal. Up until this point our dining service had been fast, attentive, and great. My water glass never stayed empty.  When our server came around to ask how our food was, the 2 ladies told him about the burger swap. They wanted our server to know of the mistake so that it didn't happen to any other diners and risk the restaurant having to re-cook or clear a check for someone later on. They were professional and kind about it, and didn't expect anything besides acknowledgement that there had been a mistake.  After bringing this to their attention, none stopped at our table again.  We had to stop a random busboy and tell him to get our checks after we'd been sitting, finished eating, for quite some time even though we were in the center of the dining room. The check came out as 1 whole (not sure who they thought intended to pick up our entire $70 bill...maybe they should have given it to the bartender who shorted me) so we then had to wait for it to be separated.   It took longer to pay and leave than it did to order and eat. Overall it was our worst dining experience the whole time we were in LV.",

We stopped by for a late lunch, and right from the start I knew the food was going to be delicious. Our waitress knew everything you could possibly know about the dishes offered there. The atmosphere was nice, but nothing fancy -- space was limited since it's inside Caesar's Palace, and the entry to the restaurant is open and wide, so you can do all the people-watching you want as tourists and gamblers trot by. It was quiet when we ate there, with a couple of other people scattered here and there. I enjoyed the *#@& out of my chicken pesto sandwich on mint bread. I would definitely go back to this restaurant to try something else if I could, because there were lots of interestingly-titled dishes screaming at me on the menu. Yay for Gordon Ramsay.",

Little did we know this meal would take almost 2 hours due to painfully slow service.  Our waitress informed us that they were out of fish & chips...this is supposed to be an \"English\" pub and you're out of fish & chips...ok.   I had the Caesar salad for an appetizer which was drenched in dressing. For my meal, I had the pork belly roll. I had high hopes since I love pork belly, but this had more fat than actual pork. It was also so salty that I could feel my fingers swelling as I ate it. Others ordered the scallops which were terrible, as well as the shepards pie, which was dry and had no vegetables in it.   The best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding.   Overall, this place sucked. I am appalled that Gordon Ramsey yells at and denigrates people on television for their cooking skills while his own restaurant is sub-par with terrible service. I am not a fan of Gordon Ramsey. Perhaps he should take a break from acting holier than thou on TV and pay attention to his shitty restaurant.",

We both love Gordon Ramsay and his crazy bad temper, so why not try his restaurant?  We had the Devil eggs and they were out of this world!!! So tasty!! Very interesting way to serve them too. Serve the yolk as a spread rather than already inside of the hard boiled egg white is pretty brilliant.  I tried the lamb burger and it was really good. I asked for some mustard for the burger and the fries and I almost died. It is so spicy!!! Delicious!!  My bf had the fish and chips and the fish was cooked perfectly. Really flaky but crunchy on the outside. Exactly what I expected out of fish and chips.  The only bone I have to pick with this restaurant is the uniforms.....what on earth were those girls wearing?? There was some waitress well in her late 30s, early 40s wearing the trashiest little number ever! And trust me, it was definitely not age appropriate. I would change their uniforms to something a little more modest. Even hooters girls look more modest and out together.   Hopefully we will be back, soon",

    "text": "The name/image of \"Gordon Ramsey\" is super hot right now, so of course there was an allure to try out this new restaurant.  It's located in Caesar's Palace, near the Forum shops entrance.  This is the location where the winner of the current Hell's Kitchen will be awarded the Executive Chef position.  Making reservations didn't seem necessary as the restaurant wasn't very full.  In fact, I was a little disappointed in our table selection considering we took the extra time to make reservations and plan weeks in advance of our LV trip (we were put in a middle isle table away from the outside view or more intimate, private booth areas).  The atmosphere of the restaurant was incredible.  The theme of an English Pub was evident in every detail, including the staffs' attire.  The color coordinated Doc Martens were awesome!  We absolutely LOVED the music (throw back memories of high school), which included The Smiths, The Cure, and other great Brit hits.  The menu offered standard English pub food.  The drink menu wasn't very expansive.  We opted to start out with the fried oysters as an appetizer with the Mothers Ruin and Ramsey's Tonic for drinks.  The appetizer was executed and delivered perfectly.  The drinks were ok, nothing spectacular compared to other places on the Strip.  One of my fav parts of our dining experience was the bread plate they bring to your table.  It was phenomenal and I wanted like 5 more!  It includes 3 different flavored pretzel sticks and nut loaf.  My fav was the herb pretzel!  It had 2 dipping options: butter and a cheddar/horseradish (which had just the right amount of \"kick\").  For our main course we got the Shepard's Pie and the Fish 'n Chips.  I really don't care for lamb and its flavor seemed to take over the whole dish.  The Fish 'n Chips were superb.  All the food was piping hot and seasoned perfectly.    We ended the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Honestly, we were so full that we left half the dessert, which was a shame considering it was so good!  The caramelized top was the best part!  It wasn't too sweet and had a nice balance with the sweet cream ice cream. Definitely worth a try!  The only reason I didn't give my experience 5 stars is because of the service.  I was disappointed that for the cost of the meal and quite honestly because it is attached to Chef Ramsey's name, the service wasn't more professional.  I took offense to the young hostess calling me \"sweetie\".  Her interactions came off as condescending and indifferent... she never greeted us until a manager came up.  And considering I am at least 2 decades older than her, it was rude.  Our waiter wasn't attentive, in fact he refilled our water AFTER we asked for the check.  We also had to ask for appetizer plates and utensils/napkins twice, while the appetizer grew cold.  While fine dining is meant to be savored and time is not of the essence...the 20 minutes it took to just get our check and pay wasn't necessary and was wasted moments of my life.     If only Chef Ramsey had been around....our dining excursion would have been heavenly.....  I mean who doesn't like Hell's Kitchen?!?  :)",

Fabulously seasoned, a hearty cut, and cooked to perfection, i'm craving another just thinking about it. If you're visiting on the weekend try to book a table online to avoid any wait but being there in the middle of the week, we got lucky I guess and were seating immediately.   Leading up to the meal I gave the garlic/parm macaroni a go and it was so tasty but mannn, pack a mint, tons of garlic gave it a real KICK.   Despite how stuffed I was on steak and mac, gluttony won out (per the whole 'Sin City' deal) and I split the Sticky Toffee Pudding with my travel homie. A warm treat topped with ice cream and a chunk of toffee brittle, super decadent but a must try.   Decor is comfy, flat screens with all times of sports airing, and a friendly wait staff. If you're going to try any of the Ramsay restaurants in Vegas, I'd recommend his Pub and Grill to anybody.",

    "text": "Quick dinner while in Caesars Palace. We visited on a Saturday evening and for a party of 5 we were seated pretty quickly. Our group ordered fish N chips, lobster and shrimp roll, Shepard's pie, deviled eggs, Mac N cheese and beef sliders. I enjoyed the last three items I listed and will start with my favorite which was the Mac N cheese. I had the selection with bacon and jalapeno. It had a lite bite of spice with a sharp cheese taste. It came out piping hot which I loved. The sliders were good with bacon, some type of sauce and arugula. Now the deviled eggs were pretty bland. I could really only taste the bacon and the egg mixture needed some more seasoning. I could have made them better at home.  The decor of the restaurant made you feel like you traveled to London. Or it could have been the Queen's Elixir Martini (nice and strong made with gin) but either way great atmosphere and good food.",

    "text": "We dined here before seeing legend Elton John and how British it really was!! Considering we were seeing Elton John, it really completed a British evening. We made reservations on Open Table and like any place on the Strip on a Sat night, reservations are key. I overheard the wait was 30 minutes but we were seated straight away, due to pre-planning.  We started off with the calamari which was fresh, crisp and had a hint of heat due to the peppers. They were served with two types of sauces, a tartar and cocktail. The serving was a good size as it allowed enough room for the main courses.  I ordered the typical WWII patriotic English dish of Fish and chips. It was not served in newspaper, sorry folks. I was pleased to see the fish as one long piece which is typical in England. I've visited the UK about four times and when I order fish and chips it's always as long as my forearm. The fish at Gordon Ramsey was no exception. The chips were actually potato wedges and not your typical chips. I ate a few only because I don't eat a lot of potatoes, it's a personal thing :). It also came with a side of yummy mushy peas, another typical British accompaniment with fish and Chips.   I highly recommend their sticky toffee pudding. For us Yanks, our pudding is different so don't expect the stuff you buy in cups and lick the lid. It's more of a sticky cake and served with a side of warm caramel and vanilla ice cream. It was sooooooooooooooo gooooooooood!!! Omg. It was moist, sweet, sticky and when you add caramel it takes it to a whole new dimension.   So to round it up, experiment and go with the British dishes. I mean you are in a British pub/ restaurant!",

The reason I'm only giving this place to Stars it's because the prices are ridiculously inflated! $34 for a burger is absolutely atrocious! It's like they're taking advantage of the Taurus. Gouging you any chance they get. We quickly learned to go off of the strip to eat and have fun. We will probably not stay on the Strip again either. It's just not worth it. The Burger was amazing but it wasn't $34 amazing. It was worth about $17, maybe $20.",

Now this was during happy house, but I think the original price is about $16. If I get a chance I'd go back to try something else because the menu sounded delicious no matter what you picked.",

But, wait for it... The dessert! Sticky toffee pudding. Sweet, sticky, yummy, boozy. So worth it! 5 stars. Forget dinner and just come for dessert.   Casual atmosphere (bar-ish), w/ high tables/stools. Adjacent to the casino, so casual. Wouldn't recommend for any romance of sorts. But the sticky toffee pudding..... ah......",

Service was great, the hostess stand was a little slow, but overall not terrible.  I was seated and my server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  I have to say, from reading the other reviews I was a little hesitant to eat here, but really it was a nice place.  I had the fish and chips, which was a perfect amount of food, though I wish it had come with one more fish.  It comes with 2 pieces of fish and about 15 or so fries.  I was advised the fish and chips were better then the Shepherd's Pie by the server, so that's what I went with.  Overall, I'd come back here for sure.",

We asked for ketchup and extra tartar sauce like 4 times and never got it... we'd finished our fries by then so just gave up. Check and payment took about 15 minutes. I'm usually really understanding about lacking service but...it was not busy at all.  Food: 3/5 the chopped salad is basically a replica of the one at Ramsey's Burger. I suppose it's my fault for wanting to be a little healthy, but the salami strips were awkwardly long. It was an ok salad, nothing to brag about. The fish and chips were alright, but it's so confusing because his fish and chips place near the LINQ is so much better. Confusing how his restaurants don't serve the same quality fish and chips.",

I wanted to treat my friends at Hell's Kitchen, but all of the reservations there were booked so we came here hoping it wasn't the same ordeal and fortunately we were able to be seated on upon arrival.  We were first seated on the high top tables and asked to be seated in the booth which they moved us with no problem. The waiter was very friendly and was able to take care of my friends with various food allergies from lactose to peanut allergies (such a struggle).  I ordered the 8oz Beef Tenderloin medium rare while my friends got Oven-Roasted Scottish Salmon, 12oz NY Strip, and Beer-Braised Short Rib. We sampled each other's meal and they were all delicious. It is what you would expect from a well known chef and more.  For dessert, I got the Sticky Toffee Pudding which you can get for free when you check into the restaurant. Mum's Apple Tart was also ordered. I was surprised how good the Sticky Toffee Pudding tasted as it looked like any ordinary dessert from face value. Desserts definitely blew my expectations away on how good it was without being too sweet.  Overall, one of the best dining experience I've had in my life. This is probably the best in Las Vegas I got, which the food service was what made the entire experience really worth it and food being secondary. Highly recommend if you win big or you're looking for a great dining experience.",

However, the incredibly friendly and hilarious bar tender was unexpected and a pleasure to chat with. We were so involved with him that we almost missed our reservation.  Dinner was spectacular. We started with french onion soup and tomato basil soup. Both were incredible. Then came fish and chips and a filet mignon. Both were incredible.

I ordered steak and mushrooms pie . Food came hot but it was lacking spices.  There was 4 small pieces total of steak and the rest was a gravy with vegetables. I   actually had to hunt for the meat . Vegetables were overcooked so you had no idea what actually you eating.Bread was hard to chew or break apart. I only give 2 stars  because I was expecting to be blown away and I was not that impressed at all. I would not reccomend this place for the price they charge.",

The Shepard's pie was fantastic, very hot so allow to cool A bit but it was amazing   The bad. The service was not very good. It took my wife 20 minutes to get her Diet Coke. I ordered a 35oz Guinness which wasn't bad, but clearly was not poured properly( Guinness is very specific). My wife had the rotisserie chicken. Dry, zero flavor.

I had the UK Flight and my wife got the IBU Flight.  Both were excellent and delicious.  It was just cool to have a seat and take a breather and drink beers at Ramsay's.  It was a 15 bucks for a flight I guess that's rather nominal for Vegas.  We got the truffle fries for snack and they were a little bottom of the barrel for us but they do have actual grated truffles which is nice.  Overall it's for the fans and if you also like beer you can't miss.",

For a Friday night, there was only a 15 min wait via Open Door reservations. The hosts were friendly, and the service was fantastic...5 Stars!  Our total bill was about $120...the tasting menu was $80 itself but we split it among 2 people.  We started with the wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles, bacon, tomatoes, crispy onions, red onions, hard boiled egg, and a sherry dressing...it was very fresh tasting with lots of flavor.  They had a sample tasting menu consisting of seared scallops with a vegetable medley...delicious! Maybe the scallops were a tad overdone, but the sear was nice and buttery/crusty! Next course was the beef Wellington...Gordon's is one of our favorites, but compared to the entree at \"Steak\" at Paris, this one did not seemed to be cooked as well, even the pastry crust fell apart while we were cutting it up, but maybe that was the knife's fault?! It was still very tasty in the red wine glaze! And then there was a cheddar potato puree with 2 carrots & 1 asparagus stalk...all were delicious. And finally, the dessert...it has become one of my favorites, and I hate when I have to pass it up!  We shared the course among 2 people, and it was plenty of food!",

After trying to wave our waitress down, my husband being the gentlemen that he is gave me the burger he got which had the cheddar because we both ordered the same exact thing except I didn't get truffle fries.   All our waitress worried about was that she put in-the order correctly. Tacky and no Gordon Ramsey's standards of customer service! Disappointed as I am a huge Gordon Ramsey fan! But the service in his restaurant lacks his finesse. Other people can't keep up the standards that made you famous. Sad  Merry Christmas thank you for the wrong order and not even a free dessert for messing up the 80 dollar burger experience! Blah",

There is a wide variety of items on the menu to choose from so it was easy for the group.  The beer menu has a fairly large selection, but I opted to go with the Black and Tan.    We did not opt for appetizers for the table since some of the group was using that as their meal (the wings were plentiful enough to be able to use as a meal).  I opted for a twist on the traditional pot pie - chicken, bacon, kale pot pie.  It was delicious and full of flavor. I loved that it came with a small pretzel roll to dip in the sauce as well as a small side salad (with some awesome dressing on the side).  I don't know the type of dressing since the roll and small salad were not listed as coming with the meal, but I was pleasantly surprised by it.    It seems like a casual fun place to have dinner and hang out for some drinks so would stop in again if in town!",

It was about 2pm and we all ordered salads and soups, only to have to wait about an hour to eat a morsel of food. The drink I ordered, The Pub Crawl, which was delicious, took at least 30 minutes to get. The server said that was normal cause it had 7 steps to making it. UMN, no its not normal. I think he had too many tables and not enough help - he was running around the whole time.   DINNER - Loved the food so much we came back a couple days later for dinner. This time my drink, same one as before, took less than 10 minutes to get. We had great service, and were taken care of. The opening bread pretzel sticks with dips are a highlight of the meal, just don't eat too many cause they are filling! My shepards pie was the bomb.  I would get that again next time and highly recommend it.   *If you get a beer and don't finish it you get a cute plastic Pub cup to go. Great little trip memento to bring home.",

My husband and I went to eat last night (a Wednesday night) and literally waited nearly 15 minutes for one of the two waitresses mindlessly walking by us to either acknowledge us or even say hello. Nothing! Shame on you for the piss poor service at this location with Gordon Ramsay's name on it. I would hate to see the service on a weekend when it actually is busy. Needless to say we left and had an amazing meal at Mesa Grill and dropped $300 for dinner. Totally worth it, so the silver lining was discovering a much better dining option at Caesar's!",

The bartenders were very attentive even though they were swamped with a full restaurant and people waiting in line to get in.    I had the beef cheek sandwich with their home made chips on my first visit.  It was a great sandwich but I had never tasted beef cheek and did not really like the flavor but still finished it.  Their home made chips and onion dip were great.  My next visit I had the fish and chips.  Plenty of fish, very light and flaky well seasoned but not too much.  I recommend both dishes.  There are plenty of places to eat in Vegas as we all know, I recommend at least one visit here.  I'm sure I will go back again as a favorite.  I like the fact that if you are a Harrah's Rewards member you get a couple bucks off on the price and it's listed clearly in the menu.  Great job Chef Ramsey !!",

However they were still serving for another hour. Get your facts together.....   I believe our Server was Elise. She was amazing.   We saw they had mac and cheese on the menu up front however it was not on the menu we were given. So we asked and were brought the pub menu as well. We both ordered beers they were great.  We then ordered out Mac and Cheese and were going to share the truffle chips (fries). Our Mac and Cheese came out before our appetizer.  We asked about it and then just told them never mind. The Mac and Cheese was Damn  good.  They ended up bringing the truffle fries. They were very good, however the dipping sauces were not very good.   Back to the Service. OMG Elise she was great. She was joking with us and made our dinner out a wonderful experience. She made a real connection with us. Would recommend her to anyone...  However the main menu was a little over priced from what i saw the portions to be.  Take a look at what you are serving and make some adjustments.   Will go back again....",

No tables and the hostess said they basically wouldn't have any tables available for the rest of the night - so luckily we found two spots at the bar. We shared the Scotch Eggs, Lobster Rolls and Fish and Chips. Everything was just OK - I was expecting more from Gordon Ramsay!!! The Scotch Egg was basically just one egg, cut in two. At most pubs, when you order Scotch eggs, you usually get at least two eggs - for half the price of what we paid for this one. As far as taste, it was just OK - they put some kind of sauce on it that was almost a little too much. The lobster rolls were pretty flavorless, in hindsight I'm not even sure why we ordered them. I guess it sounded good at the time. The fish and chips was the best thing we ordered - and also the most expensive fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was actually the best thing - the chips were just mediocre. The fish was really good though - and the tartar sauce was tasty. Also, they close at 11:00, which was weird to me for a pub in Vegas. I definitely won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others. So many better places to eat in Vegas!!",

Get rid of those high top tables also in front or tell your hostess not to seat people there that early in the day.  The lamb burger is a big gooey mess with that goat cheese. Your fries could be a little more crispy too .",

Our server presented the ipad with their brew selection. When he returned we ordered our food and asked him to pick the best beers for our entrees. He hit it perfectly. I had the fish and chips with the same beer that is used for the batter, my bro had beef cheeks with some other beer. We had the poutine for an app. Amazeballs!!   Great service! Great food!

    "text": "I tried the restaurant twice on my resent visit. The first time for lunch. as I approached the podium 4 women were talking and it took about 5 seconds for one of them who all had seen me approach them to ask can I help you.  Well yes you can I am hear for lunch okay lets seat him at table #, no put him at table are you kidding I was the only one in the restaurant at 11:45 others were eating in the bar. I order the corned beef sandwich and the waiter Scott informed me that he would have to check to see if the bread is available. Scott returned and said you are in luck the bread is available, \"why should I be in luck for an item listed on the menu\". I wish the bread was not available and that I could have chosen something else, the bread was so soggy from being placed on the flat top to toast the bread that the sandwich fell apart.  I had to eat the sandwich with a fork.  Also the ends of the bread were so hard it was not a pleasant experience.  I returned to the restaurant again to give it a second chance. Normally I would not return but since it was located in the hotel I was staying at I decided to return.  It was dinner time and again I was disappointed. I sat at the bar this time to make the hostess job easy for them again 4 women standing at the podium. I witnessed the following from the bartender and others. The bartender after politely taking my order returned to the kitchen and returned with a cup of water melon as he ate it he did not was his hands that he used to stick it in his mouth. He also drank water from a huge water bottle at the bar. If that was not enough he continually checked his phone. As I waited for my food another employee stopped at the bar and informed the servers that the glass washer was not working. Some how he turned the conversation into I did not break the washer I washer I break hearts. Well this went on for a while and something I did not want to hear about after a long day sitting in a seminar.  Well not the food came and again it was very greasy, I order a burger and should be juicy but not to the point that the bun fell apart. I do not mind spending my hard earned money but $37 with a tip for a glass of Stella that was not cold and cheeseburger with fries is crazy. I also paid $35 for lunch which was below my expectations for the Great Gordon establishment.    There might be a reason why the restaurant was not busy both times I visited and hotel was sold out per the front desk.",

After our meal was finished, we felt still bothered by the fact our waiter was incredibly discourteous to us, so we asked to speak to a manager. The manager kept saying \"oh if you told me earlier, I might have been about to do something\" to which we replied \"we kept asking where our food was.\" The manager comped 2 drinks for our friends, but this entire place is a poor excuse for an incredible name like Gordon Ramsey.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. Now normally I avoid places like this because they are usually overpriced for a mediocre quality of food. But we had $100 to spend on dinner and Hell's Kitchen was not on our possible options, so we went to the next best GR restaurant in Vegas. Located inside Caesar's Palace, it is next to the food court and the Caesar's rewards. The decor and architecture is quite chic pub like. They have multicolored barrels creating a partition which is a cool idea. In the back is an Eng village pub feel with wallpapered wall and a fireplace with a mantelpiece.  We didn't have to reservations but got seated immediately. Looking over the menu, I do have to say, there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians and chicken lovers. We wanted to stick to the GR signatures (cz we are only doing this once!). And those signatures included 4 red meat options, a salmon and a scallop option.  So since chicken was out, I decided to go with the Scottish salmon and my boyfriend decided on the braised short rib. We got the calamari for an appetizer.  The calamari was good! Crispy, tasty, albeit a little salty and decently sized. The addition of peppers on it was a good touch.  I was a little underwhelmed by the salmon. Broke off beautifully and was obviously well-cooked. But I love my flavours and it was quite bland. The veggies in the cream sauce around was a decent touch. But, maybe add some pepper?  The short rib, again, broke off beautifully. In fact, my boyfriend did not need to use a knife! But he wasn't seeing stars with it. At times, it had a slight burnt taste. The veggies and mashed potatoes on the side were decent.  Because of our yelp check-in, we got a free sticky toffee pudding - a desert lover's (not me) delight! It's a hefty sized thing, so easily something to be shared by 3-4 people. It was good, but got quite heavily sweet towards the end. All in all, pricing of the food matches the restaurant name but I cannot give the food more than 3-3.5 stars. Guess I was looking for more spices from the GR recipes!",

Every last one of them.\"  Gordon Ramsay  But boy do we love you, Chef Ramsay!  We got the Washington Steamed Mussels with thick cut fries fries and the Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls with a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was insanely good! I couldn't believe how much mussels you get for $14. They were steamed in a mild hefeweizen with some Sriracha. Rodney told us to dip the perfect crispy-on-the-outside-and-creamy-on-the-inside fries in the beer and it was great. The Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls were also amazing. Served on a toasted and buttered roll, you get huge chunks of lobster and shrimp. It was creamy, had bright citrus flavor, sweet from the natural flavors of the seafood, with the slight bitterness of the daikon sprouts to help cut through the fat and acidity. It was a great balance of flavors. As for the brussel sprouts, you could probably safely pass on these but hey, we needed some vegetables that weren't deep-fried, okay?  With the Yelp check-in offer, you get a free Sticky Toffee Pudding! Rodney put us to the test to guess the cake. *whispers* It's a date cake! They put caramel and vanilla bean ice cream on top and wow! What a great dessert! It'll make you want to stomp your foot like a horse that just learned math!  So come to GR Pub & Grill! You can get a taste of a British pub while being dazzled by the flashiness of Las Vegas! 5-stars because while the food is amazing, Rodney really made our evening!",

    "text": "\"Look, Joyce! It's the man of your dream's place!\"  I pointed out, me flipping Mesa Grill the bird, as we stroll on by.  Yaaas! We're going to MY man-crush's place, GR Pub & Grill! Ever since I stopped by GR Burger, I have decided I need to try his other places.   GR Pub & Grill did not disappoint. We came here for dinner on a Monday night and were seated at a high top with ease. Our waiter was Rodney and he was a cool guy. Since the wife and I had a pretty delicious lunch, we decided to just order a couple of things to share. Joyce got the Steamed Washington Mussels and I got the Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls. We also used our Yelp check-in offer to get a free Sticky Toffee Pudding.   Everything tasted as good as Ramsay looks. The mussels were cooked in a delicious hefeweizen with some Sriracha, some thick cut fries served on the side, and the Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls were tasty. And the dessert, don't get me started! We were asked to guess what flavor the cake was by Rodney. I guessed raisin and Joyce guessed fig. The answer? It was date! We were pretty close so we felt good.  All in all, GR Pub & Grill was great! Get your British pub food faire here in Las Vegas. And if you have Rodney as your server, you're in for exceptional service. Now go and give my man-crush your patronage and money!",

The atmosphere was \"upscale pub\" and the food followed theme. We opted for the calamari appetizer to share, which was a delicious crispy treat (though just a tad on the greasier side?) with yummy cocktail and tarter sauces for dipping. We also split the mini burgers, which came as a duo. And then we were treated to a Yelp deal of a free sticky toffee pudding. And O.M.G. if you haven't tried this dessert yet, please do so as soon as you can! It's light and not too sweet and melt in your mouth all kinds of yum.",

I ordered from the bartender and waited while getting an opportunity to witness the intense work that a Las Vegas bartender goes through.   The Wellington Steak eventually arrived and I took it to share with my hubby and two kids as an afternoon snack.  My daughter, who is usually picky with her food, really liked it.  The meat was very tender and juicy. The steak seasoning was light and  went very well with the flaky crust that wrapped the steak.  It was a pretty expensive (overpriced) dish. But I guess that's the premium you pay for being at Ceasar's Palace and experiencing a Gordon Ramsay dish.",

The fries & nachos not surprisingly were both good. The duck was horrible & cold. I could not eat it. The crispy pork belly was another starter I couldn't swallow.  I got there on a Tuesday @ 11am, as soon as they opened. There were flies all over. Not fruit flies, bigger. We kept swatting them off our food & I actually swatted one away from my husband's tee shirt. - This was annoying. On the plus side, I checked in using Yelp & was instantly given a coupon for a free Sticky Toffee Cake. It was AMAZING! The best dessert I've had in a long time. It came hot with ice cream. I would definitely come back solely for this dessert. Gave this place 3 starts for the dessert alone.   Another negative was that the bathroom stall offered no privacy. I wasn't comfortable with the gaps around the door of the stall. I rushed to get out of there.",

We had a reservation for just after they opened at lunch on a Saturday. We clearly didn't need one as there was no one there at that time. I know it's weird but I keep remembering that the waiters were wearing studded suspenders, I guess it stood out cuz it was the second time in one day that I saw waiters in suspenders. Must be the new thing, not that it even matters!  First off, there is no kids menu...apparently those are for chain restaurants according to them. Ok then! So my daughter ended up ordering the Mac and cheese side which was big enough for 3 people to eat. The other options for kids are sliders.   All together we ordered the soft shell crab sandwich, the ginormous BLT, the pesto chicken sandwich and salmon salad. The sandwiches all came with homemade kettle chips. They were so good drizzled with vinegar and salt. Everything was so good but the chips definitely needed that extra salt.   For dessert I checked in on yelp and received a free sticky toffee pudding. I would have ordered whether it was free or not! Every restaurant has had consistently delicious sticky toffee pudding. Don't ever skip it!",

Great presentation and a decent price given its Caesars Palace.   Stopped tonight and ordered the salmon. Beautifully presented. I prefer my salmon a bit more cooked so I'd recommend medium well instead of medium. Still delicious. Bartender offered to recook but I had enough to satisfy me. Very pleased both times.   Both nights a very friendly and gracious staff.  Third time here. Fish and chips. I thought the smashed peas sounded weird but let me tell you what...they are so good. With just a touch of lemon. The fish was perfect. The tarter sauce was by far the best I've ever tried. So three times and all of it good...they get a 5 star which everyone knows I rarely give out.  Sorry. If I could give them an extra star I would. The sticky toffee pudding is probably one of THE best restaurant desserts I have EVER had.",

I'm never going to be able to eat anywhere again because nothing is going to live up to Gordon's food. Sigh.  ;)  For appetizers we got the Ale & Onion soup, pure magic. The flavor was INCREDIBLE! By far the best onion soup I've ever had.  Then we got the Corned Beef Poutine, I mean, I think you can guess where I'm going with that...it was delicious!! The gravy was decadent, the cheese was super yummy and the fries were just the best! Last app we ordered was the deviled eggs, I'm not a huge fan of ordering deviled eggs at a restaurant. However, my dad loves to and obviously I had to try them! They were very tasty, just enough tang and heat to make you want more!!  My husband ordered the Beef Wellington, which he loved. I had a bite of it, it was definitely delicious! Neither one of us have ever had Beef Wellington before. Naturally we had to try it at Gordon's restaurant. :P  My husband loveeesss old fashions! So he ordered one our server recommended which was a smoked old fashion. They literally smoke it right in front you, so freaking cool!!  My mom got the pork chop, literally melt in your mouth. We ate so much we were about to BURST! She also got one of the signature margaritas, so tasty!!  Needless to say, it was a great experience and our server MJ was very attentive as well as the supporting staff. I highly recommend trying everything you can! :D",

From the menu we ordered mini burgers to share, I had the cocktail of the day (something delicious and fruity) and a draft beer. The cocktail and beer were good but the pub burgers were just \"ok\".   Slightly disappointed that they didn't taste better considering this is Ramsay's place but maybe I woulda had better luck if I had ordered a full meal.

The cod I could tell was EXTREMELY fresh and I know that because you could see the iridescence when you moved it in the light.  Only complaint is that the batter was VERY salty and I love salt but, it was a bit too much. The chips were perfectly cooked with the lovely herbs in top. Was not a fan of the mint peas that came with it but that's just me. I love mint and peas just not together.  Also ordered the pigs in a blanket and I could tell that were high quality sausages due to their taste and texture. Been a long time since I had a good sausage roll. The house made BBQ sauce was delicious. Both sweet and tangy. Great balance.  I wish there weren't TV screens all over but I get it. Its Vegas and tourists in particular are all about betting especially since its NFL season.  All in all it was as I remembered and enjoyed my experience.   -Las Vegas Local",

The staff didn't smile much either. The food was mediocre too.. The batter on the fish disintegrated the moment the knife hit it and the fish was flaky but tasteless..you tell how you feel about a meal when you get the bill, hence the 2 stars...",

We were seated right away, in front of a TV--as requested. A few years ago, I tried Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris and was not impressed, even though I had the chance to meet the contestant winner, Christina. The pub, on the other hand, is all about the food--no hype. Everything was delicious and fairly priced. We even checked in and got a free dessert. Highly recommend!",

They cost double what other places charged.  My favourite beer (Fuller's ESB) is on tap, which attracted me in the first place. They were out. I can get over that, but throughout the week I was in Vegas, they never did have it available (I called) The extra star is only because the bartender was good. Shame that this carries the name of a chef that is supposed to be talented. Is it he or his chefs that lack the talent?",

The soup was great, I can't complain about it. On the other hand the butter chicken was completely tasteless. Seriously, getting a butter chicken at India Jones (the LA food truck) is waaaaay better than this. When I told the waitress about how bad the food was, she called the manager. The manager came to the table and offered 50% off of the dish that I didn't eat. When I told him that you come here trusting the \"name\", you expect something a bit better than this. He told me that I have to understand that chef Ramsey is not in the kitchen cooking or yelling at people. What a lot of crap.  Save yourself time and money and avoid this place even is there is no other place to eat.",

The service we received was fun and what I would hope for from any restaurant in Vegas. The food game out quickly and correct. The ambiance is nice. People watching from the railing tables was amazing.  Food: I ordered the bangers and mash and it was wonderful. I see a lot of complaints about the portion but it was a nice size. No need for you to have a feeding trough amount of food. The mash was full of flavor and was perfect texture. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it was out of this world!  My husband ordered the 14 oz ribeye and it was cooked to perfection and needed none of the sauce choices. He ordered his sauce on the side and never needed to touch it since the steak stood perfect alone.   So yes it's expensive but don't go to any restaurant on the strip and expect McDonald's prices for a buffet amount of food.... I highly recommend the pub if you want a awesome meal.",

I ordered the smoke and mirrors drink and it came in second in taste and quality to my friends drink. The sliders were savory and tasty. The wings were pretty good.

Our waitress forgot our drink orders, so she came back to ask us what they were 15 minutes after she promised to get us some glasses. We decided to cancel our drink orders right then and there, because hey, why spend $11 on a beer when you can get drinks for free while gambling? She then brought out our canceled drinks 5 minutes later, reminding us that she had in fact remembered to enter in our drink orders. Uh, what the !@#$? We asked that she take them back.  Other than the strange drink order situation, the food was nothing more than mediocre. But ridiculously expensive. My stupid salad was $17. The scotch egg appetizer was $11. For one egg. I know prices are high in Vegas, but for the spotty service and so-so food, this is a big no-no.  I still can't believe this place exists. Shame on you, Gordon Ramsay.",

It came with 4 stalks of asparagus, which were also cooked well.  The lobster mac and cheese, however, was the high point - eating it was a spiritual experience!

Very excellent.    Also the Salt and Pepper Calamari was really good.  I ordered the PEI Mussels & Clams with Chirozo and it was amazing.  The mussels & clams and chirozo tasted just like anywhere else but the broth it was in was delicious.  Sopping that up with the bread took the meal over the top.

    "text": "Thankfully I do not have to be able to hear to write a review because this place is LOUD! So loud in fact that sitting at a table I had to literally yell for people at the same table to hear me. The fact this place sits in a casino makes it bad, but then if you add the tv's playing sports at maximum volume it makes it even worse.   The food is just okay. I have been to other Ramsay restaurants and they were by far better than this. Although it is not horrible it should be noted. I would suggest that anyone that comes here to eat some of the more British style food like shepherds pie or fish and chips. After all it is a British chefs menu and would you go to a Mexican restaurant and have spaghetti?",

Not only do they refill your drinks the second they are low but they also know what you want before you even ask its pretty awesome. But besides the great service the food is also really great. I had there lamb burger which was recommended by the staff. I was here for lunch so its unfortunate i wasn't able to try there dinner menu. There prices are sort of high but then again it is Vegas so that is kind of expected. Overall its a great place and well worth checking out.",

She recommended the Lamb Burger (one of their best burgers) and an Anchor Steam Beer.  It was a great combination,  The burger got to my table in less than 15 minutes after ordering and it was hot and juicy.  This was the best burger I've ever had. The service was unbelievable, with Nicole checking on how I liked the burger and beer.  During the meal the person who delivered my meal suggested the bread pudding for dessert. OMG the bread pudding was soo good and I don't usually have dessert after a meal.  Overall, my experience at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was one of the best meals I've had in many years.",

    "text": "My magical evening at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill began two years ago. I had saved over a year for my 40th birthday celebration, prepared to make this an experience of a lifetime, until all the friends I invited bailed leaving me spending my 40th in Vegas with my ex-boyfriend/best friend. We decided to make it a lavish affair, buying backstage passes to \"O\" and booking reservations at Gordon Ramsay Steak, fulfilling dreams I thought beyond my reach.  July 27th , 2013 - Dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak  I have watched every episode of Hell's Kitchen so we decide to splurge and order the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu with Wine Pairings, fulfilling both my foodie and photographic dreams to eat, and capture food perfection. Our waiter William, and sommelier Thomas were fantastic and might even remember me as the girl in the pink tutu and rainbow furries. Every moment was savoured and devoured, as an evening of good food should be.  Christina Wilson was the chef that day, and I remember happily paying our $600 bill upon receiving my sealed, numbered, souvenir menus to take home.  What we didn't know as we dressed to see \"O\" the next day is that those menus were already gone, it was not until I looked through the pictures while on the plane and confirmed with my friend when I returned to Canada that we realized neither of us had packed them...because the maid had thrown them out.  I contacted the hotel to search for them, not realizing at first that they were not even in our room on the last day. After a lengthy investigation (6 months), I was informed Planet Hollywood was not accepting responsibility for my menus, and therefore consider the matter closed. I was heartbroken. I attempted to reach out to Gordon Ramsay Steak, it was certainly not the restaurants' fault, but I thought I'd tell them my story in case they could reprint my menus or something. I called the restaurant on multiple occasions, being put on hold and transferred over and over again to the hotel. I never did manage to talk to anyone at the restaurant, until a recent visit to Vegas (April 2015) with my 13 year old daughter.  I wanted to show her where I had discovered my food love, and took a chance on approaching the hostess, I don't think I got one sentence out before I realized she wasn't even listening and then dismissed me saying sorry there is nothing we can do.  Deflated once more, I gave up on having any chance of fixing this situation and thought I had moved on, until tonight.  June 19th, 2015 - Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill  We meet our lovely and kind waitress Elyse, while grabbing a late dinner before our first night @EDC.  Throughout the course of our delicious meal I share the story of my 40th birthday, the amazing food and sad ending, tears begin to fall.  Elyse decides to make this dinner extra special, and brings me a piece of fabulous sticky toffee pudding closely followed by Scott Cummings carrying an autographed menu, I was over the moon.  While being regaled with Gordon Ramsay stories, Randall (the Bar Manager) brings me a couple of lovely mementos and asked to share my story on Yelp.  I want to send a huge heartfelt thank you to all of the wonderful staff I have been so fortunate to meet at Gordon Ramsay's Restaurants; it's more than orgasmic food!",

The unfortunate news is that this review solely reflects the food.   The scotch eggs were a good starter (I love HP sauce), and it all went downhill from there. We also ordered the pretzel starter, and there was no warning on how hot the mustard was! I love heat in a dish, but there should have been some warning. I dunked that sucker all the way in not realizing that it would take my breath away. It came with 3 under seasoned pretzel sticks, and the cheese sauce was nearly tasteless.   My pulled chicken sandwich came out soggy from the kitchen. The over application of cheese and sauce created a gooey sandwich I was not expecting; The ciabatta bread did not hold up. If they had grilled it on a panini press, it would have been a different story!  I had a few bites of my boyfriend's fish and chips. It was better than my sandwich, but there was no seasoning. To their credit, the fish was fresh and flaky, but there was no flavor to it at all without the tartar sauce.  The meal was a surprising disappointment.",

Then when the meal was over, we waited at least 15 minutes to get the check after asking for it. Then the pen she left did not work. I waited another 15 minutes and still no waitress so I raised my hand with the dead pen in hand before the manager came over and gave me a working pen.

    "text": "I was really disappointed in my experience at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.   Firstly, the service was terrible. It seemed like you had to ask for every little thing (refills etc). Mostly importantly, we ordered 1 salad and 2 entrees. Over an hour later we finally get the salad and about 5-10 mins later we get the entrees. We noticed it was taking a long time and inquired but just got a passive \"it should be coming out real soon!\". We noticed from afar the manager (which we found out later) was peeking at us to see if we got our salad etc. It wasn't until I went to the hostess and asked the manager to come over that he finally did. He didn't introduce himself as the manager, just came over and said, sorry the salad took so long. He didn't even initially address why it was taking so long for the entrees. Also, we noticed tables around us getting their entrees way before us. Rather than trying to defuse the situation, the manager seemed to try to defend the poor service. \"I don't know what the people around you ordered\". \"Your entry is late because your salad was late and that caused your entree to be late\". He left the table and said he would subtract the salad. Finally, the entrees came and they were mediocre at best. The chicken pot pie was mostly gravy and hardly had any chicken in it. It also was rather smallish for the price (I'm not a huge eater either). The steak seemed like a poor quality cut and was overcooked and not tender at all. After everything was in the ditch, there was no follow-up. The management doesn't seem to understand \"writing the best last chapter\". Things WILL go wrong in the service industry, but it's how you handle it and how you send the customer away.  Gordon Ramsey needs to have more quality control. He needs to pay this place a visit and throw the book (soup?) at them.   So my biggest gripe was the service followed by less than mediocre food. I might as well just went to the quick food place next door (Cypress?). They are located across from the Colosseum. I would never chance going to that restaurant before a show.  There are some awesome places to eat in Caesar's Palace but I would definitely skip this one.",

I do have to say that the service was a little slow. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday so was still early but obviously busy. But it took us over two hours to eat our meal and a lot of that time was waiting because the service was just slow. The way Gordon Ramsay behaves on TV I don't think he would've been happy with the service. However the menu is really solid. It seems they have a lot of British classics as well as some very nice upscale dishes. Here's what the table had we had the pretzel breadstick snack which was delicious it came with grainy mustard and cheese. A friend ordered the scotch egg. I can't say that I am a huge fan of the concept but it was well executed. For entrees we had the scallops the short ribs and the tomato soup. None of these disappointed. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the sticky toffee pudding. Really do yourself a favor order the sticky toffee pudding no matter how full you are and even if you don't like dessert. It is moist, crunchy, and the sauce is soooo ridiculous!!!!",

    "text": "Having grown up in a former British colony there are two things I crave ...fish and chips and shepherds pie and Gordon Ramsey's didn't disappoint!  The shepherds pie which I haven't been able to enjoy in a few years was a bit different from what I remember from my you th but the flavors of my childhood certainly came through and the portion size was just right.  The fish was perfectly cooked ...I like a bit of seasoning in my batter but the fish was perfectly executed and I enjoyed the tartar sauce that was served with it but again needed just a bit more seasoning.  We tried so many things on the menu from the delicious truffle fries to the lobster and shrimp rolls and the expertly crafted drinks.  The service was great - our server attentive, knowledgeable but the table set up was a bit odd.  I don't like feeling like I'm sitting in a walkway and our table was directly towards the back of the host stand and we saw everyone that walked by, also we had some fun benches where people patiently waiting got to stare at us eat so that would be my one and only criticism of how the restaurant is laid out.  Mr.Ramsey and his reputation are definitely elevated by this particular location.",

Our appetizer was the pretzels (so soft and you have to get it off the Pub Menu) with the housemade mustard and cheddar ale dip.  Then we got the bangers & mash (amazing), truffle mac & cheese (so good) and the sliders (on the Appetizer section of the Lunch Menu) which were so good because they were charbroiled.  The desserts we got were the pear cobbler and sweet cream (whipped cream) which were really good but the best part of the entire meal was the sticky toffee pudding.  When I said life changing I mean LIFE CHANGING!  I've never had anything like it and I'm pissed that I probably never will again!  We put in our reservations through Open Table and I'm glad that we did because there was a 30 minute wait.  At the moment we couldn't find the restaurant on Caesar's map layout online but it's right outside the entrance to the Forum Shops.",

This \"authentic pub\" (hardly) had good food, but not great, and certainly without the flair and twist of Mr. Ramsay's usual cuisine. The charcuterie was good and the burgers tasty, but nothing special. If you're going to eat here, try the scallops. That dish was truly sublime. Atmosphere-wise, the place is open to the highly trafficked casino near the entrance to the Forum Shops, so there's no feeling of being anywhere special either. Service was unattentive and spotty.",

I've been to GRPG several times.  ...to grab a quick bite before Elton John, a luncheon with the girls, drinks at the bar after a night out.  I've been there with a party of eight for dinner and once just for dessert etc,etc.  I have never experienced anything but great service and great food!!!    Partial to seafood, I have tried almost every such thing on the menu!  The Calamari, Steamed clams, Prince Edward Island muscles and clams, lobster roll, ...all fantastic!  The lobster Mac and cheese was absolutely the best I've ever had.  The Yorkshire fish and chips were light and flaky deliciousness!  My absolute favorite was the Scottish salmon, served crispy skin-side up on a puree of fennel with caramelized cauliflower.  (Oh, and I did have an amazing salmon sandwich there as well once!)  I rarely order desserts, but the sticky toffee pudding was melt in your mouth happiness!       My opinion is that you shouldn't believe everything you read on this app!  These are some harsh critiques!!  Go try it for yourself!  Until I get to London, I will continue coming to Vegas' Pub & Grill!",

    "text": "Kitchen Nightmare I took a few days off last week to celebrate yet another year getting away from me. My wife and I went to Vegas, not for the gambling but for the entertainment and food. We stayed at Caesars Palace and one evening we thought we'd try the \"Gastro Pub\" experience offered by none other than Brit Bad Boy, Gordon Ramsay. Truth be told, although I love to cook, I'm not a huge fan of cooking shows, and shows where Mr. Ramsay makes a buck by humiliating what are often hardworking (albeit out of their depth) restaurateurs I find less than edifying. As a fellow reasonably foul-mouthed Brit bad boy who has been known to yell on occasion, maybe I just find it too close for comfort.  In any event, I love good Pub Grub so we gave it a shot. In their defense, the beer menu was excellent and the chips (French Fries for our US cousins) were authentically soggy and British... but beyond that, the food was just horrible... by far the worst we had all week. What was especially galling was the pretense that this was in some way Great British cuisine. Let's all agree on something... much (if not most) British food is horrible... really horrible. It's food made by poor people from less than great ingredients, typically over cooked under spiced and dull. It may have won us the British Empire... but it would get one star on Yelp on a good day. It is possible to do British staple dishes really well, with great ingredients and proper care Bangers and Mash or Fish and Chips can be killer... that's what's behind the current craze of \"Gastro Pubs.\" Unfortunately, done poorly Brit Grub just sucks... as did the Fare at Mr. Ramsay's Caesars Palace joint.  To start with the bread was stale. I had the fish and chips with mushy peas; my darling wife had the \"mixed grill\". The fish bore absolutely no resemblance to real Fish and Chips, and the mushy peas were simply green peas which had been pulsed in a blender for a couple of seconds... not remotely authentic. The mixed grill (to phrase it how Gordon himself might) was \"F*@king atrocious\". The steak was perhaps passable (though over-cooked and served cold), the weird pork belly thing was a revolting gelatinous mess, and the lame lone shrimp was either horribly spiced or perhaps spoiled. The waitperson did her best, and when I pointed out the shortcoming she apologized but made no effort to resolve.  Mr. Ramsay, if you are going to use your brand and our heritage to foist over priced high concept but poorly executed crap to an unsuspecting world, would you at least take the \"British\" part out of your promotion to save us the national embarrassment.  There are a thousand chip shops or hole-in-the-wall cafes up and down our damp nation which wouldn't dream of serving up the swill you deal out in Vegas. It is (by the way) entirely possible to do that kind of fare well in a Vegas context, Todd English proves that to be True every day of the week. If the menu at Caesars was ever decent, it is being betrayed by your team there... sort it out!  If this makes it to your hallowed halls, we ate on September 10th and our check number was 1884527.",

Second time I had the Salmon, cooked as expected, crispy skin , tender and flavorful. The sides was very nice with a puree and veggies. My guest had the chicken also very good and tasty, but the hamburger was just Ok. Quality of the food is good and fallows Ramsay standards, but a bit pricy for the quantity. I feel the sides were not enough and the portion on the small side.  Staff was very nice but the place is a bit noisy.",

It comes with feta or goat cheese (I had the goat...  goat w/ lamb) and it was really simple and very good.  The lamb wasn't overly seasoned, which resulted in a straight-forward, fresh tasting burger.   I substituted a green salad for the fries, which was great, but another guy at the table had the fries and raved about them.  Great, friendly service and a nice atmosphere - noisy but you'd expect that being in a casino.",

    "text": "Lets be honest I hold Gordon Ramsay up to a higher standard than your average run of the mill restaurant. For the prices charged here I just don't think this one made the mark. For lunch I ordered the Burger. The burger here is massive and you better be hungry if you expect to eat it all. The burger was also quite good. If I was doing this review solely on the burger would be 4 stars. However my Husband ordered the Calamari and it was awful. For $18 it should be fresh and this was anything but. It was chewy and loaded with salt. If this dish was on hells kitchen Gordon would thrown it right in the garbage. The pretzels were also just ok nothing special. If you go here stick to the burger but if you are going for a burger you are also much better off at Gordon Ramsay's other restaurant Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. Gordon needs to make a surprise visit here because I have a feeling he would rip his name right off the sign if he tried the food being served here.",

    "text": "The most important part of this review is at the end: the ice cream that came with the sticky toffee pudding! Be sure to read that part! So about this restaurant. I liked it, but not as much as Gordon Ramsey Steak in the Paris Hotel.  If I could give it a 3 1/2 I would. The service was efficient and friendly, and they have a decent craft cocktail menu, which I always enjoy.  I ordered some kind of blueberry cocktail and it was tasty. My Scottish salmon dinner was really flavorful and the salmon was perfectly cooked, but my husband said his steak needed salt and the potatoes were dry.  I tried my daughter's steak and ale pie.  Yum! I thought it was really excellent. I'd order that if I go again. The menu has good variety, lots of items for different moods. Like almost everything in Vegas, it's expensive. I didn't find it to be that much cheaper than Steak, and because it has \"Pub\" in the name, it makes you think it'd be less. Although since it's in Caesars Palace and it's a chef Ramsey restaurant, it's not surprising. Now let's talk about the sticky toffee pudding. Like other reviewers, I love this dessert and it was my fourth time ordering it at different Chef Ramsey restaurants. The best by far though was at Steak. What's different? The ice cream. The first time we had the sticky toffee pudding at Steak, it was divine! It came with brown butter ice cream in the shape of a stick of butter. Out of the other times when it came with vanilla--believe me, nothing has ever compared to that first time. The brown butter ice cream. I have no idea why they don't offer it all the time at every location, because it is so much better with this dessert.",

    "text": "I kind of feel let down by the hype that was created around Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. And it's mostly disappointment emerging from the food menu, which pretty much doesn't have very many vegetarian options. You really have to be a hardcore meat eater to enjoy items listed on the menu. Sure, they will modify whatever they can to make it vegetarian friendly, but the best option you really have is well, the beer. We walked in for lunch and the seating hostess seated us at the farthest table possible, which was closest to the kitchen. That just seemed very odd when there was a plethora of empty pub tables and tables with comfy chairs on the walk over. I asked that we be seated elsewhere because I did not want to smell of food. She made a face, but f*ck that. When I fork money on the food at a restaurant (and I am not cheap by any means), I expect to be seated where I deem I would be most comfortable. Once we were seated and handed our menus, the server came by almost instantly. He made recommendations on beers, but given that most beers lately are on the hoppiest side with the IPAs and such, barring your quintessential Coors, Stella, my only option was Boddingtons. Which wasn't bad (more like an amber ale), but come on, I can buy these at the store. My husband opted for a combination of Guiness and Stella, which he rather liked. We also ended up ordering an order of the Warm Salty pretzels and the mini pub sliders (minus the bacon). Here is where food math fails me - there's 2 of us, but there are 3 pretzel sticks in the order. Am I supposed to break one in half to share it 50-50 with my husband!? That said, they were soft and the mustard that came with was great! We requested that the meat be well done on our burgers, but they were medium at best. Flavorful, nonetheless. The order was fulfilling. But nothing spectacular. Our server was great. But this will probably be the only time I visit here.",

I ordered the Lamb Burger, which was cooked to perfection, juicy, succulent, along with an order of the delicious truffle fries with the heavenly sauce on the side.  This was the best burger that I have ever had and even though others in my family ordered different things and loved them, I would come back just for the Lamb Burger alone.  I should note that my 3 year old ordered the tomato soup and now compares that soup to others that we have tried to have her taste (little Ramsay fan already).  I have been to the Burger restaurant in Planet Hollywood as well, which had the same level of service and excellent quality of food.

    "text": "I'm beginning to get the feeling that every celebrity chef restaurant in town is merely a siphon for tourist cash and nothing more. The quality of food rarely ever meets the expectation that comes with the famous talking head promoting it. Gordon Ramsay demands quality on screens worldwide, but when it comes to his restaurants you get what you pay for. High quality does necessarily not trickle down from the mega-bucks eateries these celebrity chefs own.    After a decent wait - because these hot spots are always packed - my gf & I took a seat in the back. We were here at an odd hour late in the day, so we decided to just get a couple drinks and split some appetizers. That \"couple of drinks\" became one when we checked the menu and noticed each signature cocktail was $15 a pop. Now, yes, I know I could've just had something else but where's the fun in that? Still, there's no way in hell I'm going to try getting drunk on $15 drinks. I ordered a Pub Crawl, which was bourbon whiskey with ginger liqueur, lemon, and mint & black tea syrup. Tasted great, would've loved a few more... but not at that price.   For the apps, we decided on a Scotch egg and the pot pie sampler, which included mini versions of their steak, chicken, and shepherd's pie.   The Scotch egg was killer. I've had this exactly twice before in my life - the first time was very good, the second time it was two burnt lumps of sausage surrounding a medium-boiled egg. This blew both of those away. I would assume if they can make a Scotch egg great anywhere, it's going to be here.   Now, the pot pie sampler shows up and it's tiny. Really tiny. Tyrion Lannister's little mitts would make these pies look small, and in my hands they looked like silver dollars. At $24 (which is $8/each), you'd think the serving size would be double. Too bad, because the steak pie was delicious. Chicken pot pie is chicken pot pie, and this tasted like any other chicken pot pie. But the shepherd's pie was kinda rank. It smelled like dirty gym socks and didn't taste much better. WTF? I've had great shepherd's pie before and this was not even close. Lame.   We grabbed the bill at this point and - HOLY SHIT - $72 and I'm not even full or drunk?!? I don't even have a mild buzz, and I'm already asking my gf where to eat next. If you feel like blowing twice that, go for dinner. Me, I'd rather fill up somewhere else just as good; a place that won't charge me for a fancy name.",

Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay (a bit of a crush?!), his shows on t.v. and last visit loving Gordon Ramsay Burgr, hubby made dinner reservations with Open Table and we showed up at the appointed time.  Our half booth/chair table was ready and we were sat almost immediately.  The decor and general vibe is a bit loud, a bit fun, large open area looking out into casino, with a mix of slightly different appointed areas of lighting, seating and various artwork.  The table settings were unique, including the flatware.  Service was efficient and friendly and our waiter would come back with answers to our questions without being prompted to.    Appetizer:  4 stars for English style Nachos, delicious hot freshly cooked kettle chips with a terrific sharp English cheddar, a delicious English TP sauce and corned beef bits and tender short rib.  This could have been a 5 star contender but the chef was stingy on the meats.  Main Courses:  4 stars for Fish & Chips and 4 stars for Steak & Ale Pie. High end ingredients in both, tasty, tasty tasty. I opted out on the chips for chive truffle oil mashed potatoes and that was delicious.  The reason the 2 main courses didnt receive 5 stars are due to the fish batter could have been crispier and the steak & ale pie was a tad on the small size for a main course.  Did you save up room in your tummy?  I hope so because below was the only True worthy five stars!  Dessert:  5 stars for Potted Chocolate Trifle, perfection and a must for chocoholics!

I can't believe Ramsay would even want his name associated with this restaurant. We tried multiple dishes on the menu including the caesar salad, beef pie, scallops, and lamb. The caesar salad had overly fishy, bad tasting anchovies which you could barely taste under the dressing the salad was drenched in. The beef pie was not only much too salty, but too peppery as well. The scallops must not have been cleaned because eating them was like eating a handful of sand on the beach. They were also in a chowder type broth that was mostly potatoes with no flavor. The lamb was nothing special and irony tasting. We enjoyed nothing except our cocktails, which by the way were excellent. Guess this is the place to only grab a drink. I would expect food like this at Denny's, but not at an extremely high priced restaurant with Ramsay's name attached to it.   The best part if the story is that this awful foodie experience took place on a night that Ramsay was actually visiting the restaurant, but he clearly wasn't watching what was going on in the kitchen and was preoccupied by fans. If we couldn't have a somewhat decent meal with him there I would sure be afraid to try this place when he isnt there.   This really should be his next stop on Kitchen Nightmares.",

    "text": "I was quite disappointed. We paid $120 for two drinks, fish and chips (nothing special whatsoever) and a very small subpar bowl of Onion Soup. In addition, we were seated at a table for an almost 2-hour dinner on bar stools - no back. The amount we paid should have at minimum gotten us a chair! The wait staff was tolerable. My water stayed full. Another person at our table ordered calamari - it was carried around for nearly 10 mins. before the waitress figured out where it was going. At that point it was cold and being fried - not good. When we let our waitress know she did nothing - not even as much as an apology. Our bill was wrong at the end and needed to be sent back for correction. During the two hours there we were seated near a wait staff staging area - 4 dishes were broken just while we were there. This was definitely not the quality of an establishment I would associate with Gordon Ramsey's name.",

It came with these mini chocolate chip cookies I couldn't get enough of. Like I really loved it!!",

You won't believe how casual and laid back this place is, in comparison to its neighbors at Caesar's Place. Peter was our host and he reminded us of Mario Lopez!   I really like the pork rillettes (despite mistaking it for fish initially). It had none of the porky taste and looked as white as fish meat. Topped with strings of sweet caramelized onions. It was the perfect finger food to wash down with a pint of beer. We had a good pint! I can't recall its name but if a non-beer fan can love it, I am sure most people will too! It had a dark oaky color, wasn't very strong but had slightly bitter aftertaste.   The Deviled egg was a miss for me though my friend seemed to liked it. To each his own.   It's definitely one of Ramsay's biggest restaurant in Vegas and Hell Kitchen was shot there too. Interest ambiance but nothing beats the real deal English pub for sure!",

    "text": "Gordon, I had high expectations. Took a bit for the bartenders to realize I was new and have not been helped. Once noticed I ordered a bloody marry and that was fantastic. I then ordered a 1/2dz wings and a medium burger with fries. I was expecting u wings to come first since they were an app but when they came the burger was served at the same time...  I started with the wings. The second one I bit into was raw. yuck! What a turn offfffff. They got sent back and they brought me new ones but after biting into raw chicken in the first set I couldn't think about eating them the second time around. Didn't even really want to eat my burger after that. My burger was suppose to medium but it came out medium rare and the bun was soggy but at this point I just sucked it up and just ate it. I had to ask for ketchup. When it was brought to me I thought it was cocktail sauce but was informed by the bartender that was how they made their ketchup.  Over all I give you two stars for the fact that your bloody Mary's are the bomb and I appreciated the managers checking in on me. Not charging me for the wings and hooking me up with a second drink. I've been in the restaurant business for 16yrs and I know shit happens, but when both items I order come out under cooked and the guy next to me is complaining about his scallops being under cooked as well You need to step it up in your kitchen and hold up to your name.   Forgot to mention the menu is over priced. Your paying to be sitting in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in Caesars palace more then the quality of food and service. $35 for a burger and bloody marry. Plus tip.",

    "text": "Came here because Mesa Grill didn't have availability and we love BurGR. They only had room for us at the cocktail tables, and the stools were very squishy and sinking down, but had hard edges, so my legs kept falling asleep.   Our server was very friendly, but our food was somewhat slow to come out. With the location right on the casino floor, there was a man smoking a large cigar in line to get a rewards card, and the smoke cloud was almost intolerable, of course our food finally came out while the smoke cloud was hanging over us.  The food was very good. We ordered a NY strip that was surprisingly tender for a NY and cooked perfectly, but had a chunk of gristle. It was very good value compared to Mesa Grill, maybe not quite as good, but also much cheaper. Asparagus cooked well. Peppercorn sauce had an overwhelming rosemary flavor, but was good.  The pub chopped salad was also good. I think for a similar price, Cheesecake Factory has a better salad, and their portions are three times as big. The menu indicated the salad had apples, which I do not remember on the salad. The ham was more like strips of salami perhaps? It was very good, though.  The mashed potatoes were good, but the STAR of the show was the mushroom side with poached egg. This is brilliant! The egg, and I think chanterelle mushrooms, had similar texture and it was a wonderful and unexpected combination. Loved that.  The server wasn't able to adequately describe the toffee pudding. She described it as a cake. Maybe it was; her description was vague enough that I didn't want to try it.  If I were to return, I'd make sure I had a reservation and ask to be seated farther into the restaurant. I think I'd try the fish and chips next time. They looked fantastic.",

After a few minutes the bartender just started wiping glasses. We were pretty irritated and got up, the bartender noticed and said he forgot and apologized. He put in the order and brought our drinks. We waited for about 20 minutes and our bartender disappeared. I needed a refill on my beer but we couldn't get anyone's attention even though we were sitting front and center in the bar area.   There was one bartender who was glued to the television watching the soccer game. We were finally fed up once and for all. I reminded the bartender that he wasn't sitting in his apartment watching TV and to bring my bill (for 1 beer). Also canceled the burger. What's even sadder is that the bar seating around us was empty and a complete mess. On a better note the pizza in the food court next door was quick and delicious. Overall, Ramsey shouldn't act like he has such high standards and rip apart restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares then have his name on a place like this. Too much expansion to create restaurants for contestants to work at from Hells Kitchen without proper training.",

    "text": "I have to say I am a big Ramsay fan and so far the couple of Ramsay restaurants I have dined at have not let me down; and I am a fault-finding customer. With that being said, I am so surprise to see so many two and three star reviews here. Nevertheless I had to give it a go and form my own opinion.   From the minute you walk in the door you can see that the decorator went above and beyond to provide the guest a \"pub\" experience.  Now it may not fit an authentic English Pub, but you're not in London, you're in Las Vegas and I found the setting to be perfectly fitting.  We sat in the dining room and found the wait staff was personable, attentive and quick with the drink. I will say that the menu held more than your traditional pub fare, but still offered classics like Bangers & Mash or Fish & Chips.   For the table we started with Hellfire Lollipop Wings, English Beer Steamed Clams and Maine Lobster Roll Minis.  As I sit here and write this review I still cannot think of one thing I would change about the starters. The wings were unique, they were crispy, sweet, spicy and savory all at the same time, I still regret not asking what chili pepper they used in the sauce - I would say these are in the Top Three best wings I have had.  The clams were exactly what I expected, perfectly cooked clams in a tasty broth with little pieces of chorizo and the lobster rolls were spot on, as if we had been sitting in a restaurant in downtown Bangor.   For main courses, two of us got the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish& Chips and the odd man out went with a Grilled Lamb Burger. Now I can speak to the burger but from what I could see and what I was told, it was juicy, flavorful and very filling. I almost wished I had ordered it.  The fish and chips were really good. The batter was light and crisp, the cod was perfectly prepared and flaky, it was simplicity at its best. I also enjoyed the different take on chips, as they were fried potato wedges and held up well against the malt vinegar without getting soggy. The one thing that brought it all together was the little ramekin of Minted Mushy Peas.... Delicious.   As I left Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill I remember rubbing my stomach and telling my friends what a good meal that was. I really enjoyed it.  Typically I would give the restaurant 5-Stars at this point, but because of the other lesser reviews I am wondering if there are some issues with consistency and therefore until I visit again I can only give them 4-Stars.",

    "text": "11am lunch.   Caveat:  I've heard what a jerk this guy is supposed to be, and I really wanted to be able to call him out on this meal.  We'd previously tried Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood, and it was very good.  So this visit was our shot to see what the big deal is.    We actually sat at the bar before it opened.  We were sitting right there, watching, and the bartender did not use the ingredients listed in the menu.  Now, this was a recon visit, so we didn't say anything--I just took notes for this review.  Our other drink was as stated in the menu.  Okay.  Both drinks were very tasty, even very good.  (We're into mixology, so take that for what it is--the drinks were good.)  We had fish and chips and the beef burger.  We both thought the food was excellent.  Damn it to hell, I cannot trash him on this meal.  I would have liked more peas with the fish, but no ding for that.   Incidentally, I don't think it's widely known that many of these big shots' restaurants are actually joint ventures with the hotels.  Very likely there is some lack of control and issues with quality control in such arrangements.  Nevertheless, if a guy who expects 110% out of everyone in his sphere of greatness puts his name on something, he gets held to that same standard.   So, 4 out of 5 stars.  It was very good, but not 110%.  Next Vegas visit is GR Steak.  Stay tuned.  I'll be taking notes.",

Gordon Ramsay plus some beer sounds pretty awesome after a long day of work, so we still decided to give it a try despite the not so good review on yelp.   The wait wasn't too bad, we got seated in about 45 minutes or so. They do have a good variety of beer selection and other alcoholic beverages. I wasn't too disappointed at the drinks but was definitely disappointed at the food.   30 minutes after the waiter took our order, we asked about our food because the table next to us with party of 2, who got in about same time as us, already finished their food and left. He told us that our food is next on kitchen list (not exactly sure what this means). Then he came back again, he told one of my friend to choose something else from the menu because they ran out the dish he ordered.   Finally when the food came, the order got a little messed up and the food only tasted ok. The fries had different consistency where some are too crunchy and some are not crunchy enough. When we get the bill, the 18% gratuity is already included. Not a good overall experience and it was too expensive for what you get.",

Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.  Service was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.  I had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.  The scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.  The short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.  The steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.  The scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.  The sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.  All in all, I would not recommend this place. You can get similar or better food at a plethora of other restaurants, for a fraction of the price. If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be appalled at how this restaurant is executing.",

I got the fish and chips, and while they were good, they were definitely not the \"best\" fish and chips I had ever gotten.  Bottom line, the food is average. You are not going to be blown away by the food. You will be blown away by the price though. 4 of us spent $100+ after food and drink. Then again, it is Vegas, so I guess it should be expected.",

    "text": "I have lived in Las Vegas for 13 years. Over the years when friends come into town for birthdays or business, I've been to many of these celebrity chef restaurants. Some live up to the hype. This one does not.  The Service: Our waiter had no personality. He delivered his opening spiel with all the charm of a robot. He performed his duties adequately but definitely did not go above or beyond. We ordered two desserts to split between the four of us. When they arrived we asked the server for two more plates but we never got them.  None of the employees seemed like they wanted to be there.  The Food: Enjoy the pictures of the bread? That's all you're going to get. They no longer serve it. I had the Shepard's pie which I thought was a little bland. Unfortunately there is no salt or pepper on the table. So I couldn't season it. My friends had the Fish & Chips. They remarked that it looked smaller than it used to be but was still good. Lobster Mac & Cheese is creamy and delicious. Sticky Toffee Pudding is indeed very good.  Overall, I was disappointed and it's way overpriced even for Strip food.",

    "text": "Stopped in this past Saturday for a family dinner while in Vegas. I was skeptical after reading some bad reviews and I should have followed their advice. Overall, there are many better choices in Vegas to dine at and would not even give it a second chance.  Reservation/Atmosphere - We had a reservation but were seated at a bad location and bad table. They put to tables in a walk way area and then put short chairs around it. They were mix & matching the dining tables and chairs to squeeze in more people. The low bar chairs made us feel like we were at the kids table during Thanksgiving. Before we started I asked to be re-seated but they came up with excuses (30 minutes and no guarantee) and a little attitude. The waitress acknowledged the table/seats wasn't good but not much they would due. Given the time and not delaying the dinner we took it, but it was annoying and uncomfortable.   The music was way too loud when we arrived and after about 30 minutes it was turned down, probably someone complained. Hard to believe that management couldn't tell that it was too loud even for Vegas.  Service - Pretty good, attentive enough given that they were busy.  Food - Here is the second reason I wouldn't go back. The food we had was average, and I expected a lot more. Bangers & Mash was only ok. Fish & Chips were also only ok, same you can get at any sports bar. The Braised Short Ribs was a huge disappointment, the meat had a lack of any flavor, the sauce was boring and the risotto was flavorless & held too long. I really expected the quality to be better on this dish. The highlight of the night was the Chicken Pot Pie, it had a flakey crust and some great flavor for the filing, good chucks of chicken and veggies. Deserts were ok, the Sticky Toffee Pudding was the highlight.  They were very busy as expected on a Saturday night, but it showed in their arrogance over the table & waits. They we stay busy with first time diners but don't believe they will get many as repeat. They are pricey, which I am ok with, but they need to deliver on the food and they failed there.",

    "text": "I've eaten here a total of three times with some varying degrees of deliciousness, but I have to say that the most recent visit was the best.  I've never had a problems with service, although for my first visit, I was seated at the bar.  It's not easy to get great service at a bar... Anyways, this last visit was by far the best.  I had the pretzels with the home made dijon, a bowl of the corn chowder with a basil creme fresh, and the heirloom tomato sandwich.  Let's break these bad boys down:  1) The pretzels weren't anything ridiculously amazing, but the dijon mustard is the star.  You can tell it's fresh.  It's a coarse-ground mustard that has plenty of heat.  If you put too much, it will clear out your sinuses, but wasn't retardedly/annoyingly hot.    2) I'd have to say that the corn chowder wasn't my favorite, but it had some good flavor combinations.  The chowder was sweet and had some crab meat placed in, which made it much more sweet that I usually go for.  I'd kind of like something sour (citrus/lime juice possibly) to cut the sweetness.  But the creme fresh paired well to smooth the flavors out.  It cut into the sweetness a bit.  There was a bit of julienned basil to also help cut the sweetness.  Overall, pretty good.  3) The heirloom tomato sandwich is EXCELLENT.  Crispy bread with a citrusy aoli.  Perfectly rip tomatoes with thinly shaved parmessian on top.  Awesome.  I want another one for dinner.  Sh*t, I'd eat one for breakfast.  The freshness of the tomatoes work perfectly for a hot day.  And it was light enough not to weigh me doswn, unlike a shepherd's pie or a flat iron steak+fixin's.  No post-lunch naps required...  All in all, good execution and a great place to take someone to, since you'll be able to have good conversation about the decor, ipad drink menu, and presentation.",

Give me really good food with a really good beer spin that around with some really helpful service, and we are talking.  The secret to getting the best experience here is asking your server what are the specials and recommendations.  On multiple occasions, the server led me onto a tasty new adventure.  One of their highly recommended beers is the Scottish Innis and Gunn.  The server recommended this very crisp and refreshing ale to me.  It has become the centerpiece of what I am basing my dinner on.  Do not be afraid to ask them what they would pair your food with.  My servers on the occasions I have gone here, really sold the food choices by their descriptions. One evening, I tried the Shepard's Pie.  Very flavorful, very moist.  It is lamb based, rather than ground beef.  The potatoes on top were just so soft and melted in my mouth. Another one to try is the bacon cheeseburger.  Sounds simple enough, but that bacon is maple bacon...  The server told me that the bacon starts the day before.  It is cut up then soaked overnight in pure maple syrup.  It is then cooked with more syrup. I am telling you this right now, IT IS GOOD.  It is gooder than good. The chef that afternoon even came out to check on some tables.  I told him right there, \"Best thing I ever put in my mouth.\" Service was top notch.  Friendly, knowledgable servers that know the menu and the beers available. Do not be afraid to use them to help you decide on your meal.  They know their stuff.",

The server Scott Hines, barely came around to our table, we had waited extremely long for our food, and when we were finally done he took over 30 minutes to take the last plate (mine) and bring the bill (which took him about 10 minutes to pick up our cards). The place was not busy in the slightest, so there and was really no excuse.  As for the food. The second star goes to the good salad dressing and herbs on the \"herb Caesar salad with chicken\" and my friends who got a good lamb burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken in my salad however was extremely dry and lacking of flavor, moisture, or anything good in chicken. I recommend going to BURGR, or the steak place in the Paris Hotel if you are looking for good food or service. And I also recommend sending Steve on one of Ramsay's TV shows so he can learn how to serve properly especially under the name of Ramsay.",

    "text": "Ramsay does it again.  Walking into this restaurant in Caesar's, I was definitely impressed.  The decor was a hip modern twist on a traditional British pub.  The lighting was a little bit darker than I would've like but it definitely added to the ambiance.  The keg wall was probably one of the coolest parts.  Though a little loud, the charm of the restaurant was definitely appealing.  We made a reservation on-line but we were a little irritated that we couldn't call to get ahold of anyone if we needed to make changes to the reservation.  It just kept gong through and automated recording.  Also, when we approached the hostess, she actually didn't seem very enthusiastic towards us nor any other guests who approached.  It was a minor wait before we were seated.  The table was cool and I really like the chairs.  It seemed to take awhile before our server even came to greet us let alone give us water. I guess it was busy.  Once the waiter greeted us he was really nice.  Great smile and willing to answer any questions we had.  He also offered suggestions for items on the menu.  We did order some cocktails from the bar which got to us in a timely fashion and we also got a platter of bread and butter courtesy of Gordon...thanks!  The pretzel sticks were amazing.  I lathered them in butter and gobbled them up!  The drinks were good and strong yet pricey but what do you expect for Vegas.    Most of the entrees were pricey as well.  I ordered the lamb shanks and was definitely pleased.  They were tender and well seasoned.  Absolutely yummy!  My boyfriend ordered the Shepard's pie.  The mashed potatoes were to die for.    Overall, my experience was great.  Ramsay definitely does know his way around a restaurant.  Then only qualm I had was with the hostess'.  If they were a little more charismatic and interested in the customers they were about to seat, I think I would've rated it a 5/5 instead of a 4/5.  Still great though. :-)  Will definitely go again!",

They're served with a cheddar sauce and mustard. Fair warning: the mustard is quite hot, like Chinese mustard hot. Good but if you're not expecting it you'll be surprised.  I started with the English ale and onion soup. Very good.  A friend and I split the lamb burger with feta cheese. The burger was quite bland. Really could have used salt and even the feta was on the bland side. On the plus side it was cooked perfectly.

The lamb burger was just ok. Not much, if any, seasoning. The 4 sticks of french fry potato slices were also cute but not very tasty. Dessert was fine, the toffee pudding thing seemed like a safe bet.   Overall, I don't recommend it and I wouldn't return.

We weren't wowed with the food at all with the exception of the onion rings and dessert The staff was Awesome from the greeting till the end. Much nicer than the Atlantic City location and bigger too. The staff and atmosphere will bring us back for another try, but perhaps will do another GR next time",

    "text": "Well, in direct comparison to the Wolfgang  Puck Bar and Grill, Gordon Ramsay's joint suffers a bit. We came in late one evening, and the place was absolutely packed. Now, I understand the place is not geared for kids, there was no kids menu available. But I really appreciated their accommodating our little party. The manager made a special point greeting our little munchkin, and made her day by giving her a Gordon Ramsay pen...it instantly became her favorite art instrument of choice.  The deviled eggs were expensive, at over $3 per bite, but really surprisingly bland. Fish and chips consisted of two huge fillets of crispy but bland fried cod, a nice version of mushy peas, and large serving of steak fries that were just meh. The $45 ribeye was a perfect medium rare, but was marred by being excessively gristly and fatty without being particularly marbled. The accompanying bear aide sauce was a cold, congealed mess. Come on Gordon, at these prices you can afford to serve better quality than this!   Speaking of prices, single bottles of hard cider were $11...a \"special\" was a bucket of five beers for the low, discounted price of...$40!  Whoa!",

    "text": "From the moment we walked in for lunch, a couple of weary Las Vegas noobs, we felt welcomed and valued as customers. Huge fans of the Ramsay franchise, this was a bucket list visit for sure.   The atmosphere was warm, inviting and a nice break from the overwhelming glitz of Vegas. We were shown to a comfortable booth and quickly introduced to our waiter Julio and placed a drink order, eager to try some of the authentic beer offerings. The menu's food offerings were all tempting and while waiting for our beers, we debated which we wanted to try.   Julio returned with some bad news; neither of the beers we chose were immediately available, which made us turn back to the menu and we went for Gordon's favorite, Innis and Gunn.   Shortly, we were introduced to Randy Goldich, the bar manager, who apologized for the unavailability of our original choices. We appreciated his candor and spent several minutes chatting before he left us to enjoy our drinks.   Our waiter Julio and his partner David were quite attentive and soon we had our meal selections; I had the grilled lamb burger and my wife had the Pub Chopped Salad. We also had the sticky toffee pudding as well and what can I say, the food quality was Ramsay level, just as we expected.   Despite it being early afternoon, we were treated to a visit as well from Hells Kitchen season 12 winner Scott Cummings who was friendly and engaging. Come to think of it, everyone we met there went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special.   Our Vegas trip was a first and the standards set by our visit to Ramsay's Pub and Grill are sure to make us come back again.   Thanks to Randy, Julio, David, Scott and everyone else for giving us such a wonderful visit to remember.   Tim and Debbi Crawford (we'll be back!)",

We were seated at a high top table and the stools were comfortable but had no back support, so you want to eat and not linger.   Their wine selection is abysmal and the server was so excited \"about our many beers\". Really? Maybe because I'm from Michigan and we have usually have at least 10-20 craft beers on tap. The beer selection was rather boring at the Pub and Grill and topped out at maybe 12 beers.   I got the Braised Short Rib and while it was fall off the bone tender, there was nothing spectacular about it. It was simply atop some plain old mashed potatoes with a few undercooked carrots and parnsips on the periphery. Certainly not worth near the $40. I don't think I would ever eat here again. Not that it was a horrible experience but because there was nothing special about anything.",

    "text": "Lot's to say about this place...  First, the decor with all the kegs would lead you to believe that this place is a good place for beer. It is not. There's a fairly limited selection, and they are not exactly impressive beers to choose from.  We were seated at a table that I'm not sure was originally intended for dining. It was low to the ground with sofas on either side. It was incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and I had to adjust numerous times so that my legs would wake back up.  My burger wasn't bad, but had too much of a taste to it that I can't place. Maybe garlic? It kind of ruined it for me. I wished later I would have tried something else. The fries weren't exactly the greatest, either.  I'd give the restaurant three stars, but two things picked it back up for me.  First, the sticky toffee pudding was very good. I had not had it before, so I can't really give a comparison to any other sticky toffee puddings, but it was so good I was sad when it was gone.  Second, the service was very good. We didn't even know our dinner was delayed, and we got apologies from the waitress, the manager, and the person who brought out our food. Seems that there was an issue with getting it out from a ticket being closed when it shouldn't have, so they redid the entire meal. Our dessert was free as well, which was a nice touch. It was nice to see that the customer service that Gordon is always preaching on Kitchen Nightmares held True for his restaurant.",

Located near the Forum Shoppes in Caesar's Palace, we had no trouble finding this restaurant in the huge casino. We arrived without reservations and ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table. The 2 of us were seated near the back of the restaurant. The ambiance/vibes are definitely watered down back there. Our seats were super uncomfortable armchairs where I almost sank completely in and could barely reach the table.   We ordered the Shepherd's Pie and the Butter Chicken Curry. I tried a few bites of my bf's Shepherd's Pie, and it was good, but not exceptional (pies are not really my thing). My Butter Chicken Curry was also the same. Was not expecting it to taste like chili instead of curry. If you do end up ordering the curry, I recommend NOT mixing the curry sauce with all the yogurt/rice/chicken. I did that, and it ruined the whole dish.   Wish we saved room for the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Don't know when I'll be dining here again to try it.",

It was around 6pm on a Wed night. Very different experience compared to the first time.   Things have changed a bit since the first time I was there. First, the yummy complimentary bread is now $8. Second, the bar menu with the sliders is not available anymore. Third, my salmon is now prepared differently.  However, it was still perfectly seasoned, and skin, perfectly crispy. Unfortunately, my fish was still raw inside. Upon showing this to my waiter, he took it back to refire me a new one. I watched my family eat their yummy dinner as I waited for mine. Time seemed to have passed very slowly as I waited. When my refired salmon finally came out, it was as tasty as I could ask for.  To my surprise, my salmon was taken off the bill, and we were also offered a dessert of choice. This kind of service has ensured my return.   While this place is pricey, the quality of the food and service matches it.  I just hope that changes in the future are more positive than negative.",

Our waiter was very nice and attentive without being annoying.   For the bad..  I realize this is a pub theme but with a bill for 2 @100+ the tvs everywhere make it much less special. Especially  on the dinning room side. March madness bs didn't help either. We had a female server come to our table on 2 occations with dishes that were not ours and she seemed completely lost. We also over heard two waiters standing directly behind me talking about rude customers. They very well might be rude but talk in the back.

She made great recommendations on both food and beer. She recommended the Inns & Gunn I believe that's what it was called as Gordon Ramsey's favorite beer .. and always made sure we had beers. She was extremely busy but still very attentive. Going to a new place you never know what to get so we followed her recommendation on that too, so we got the fish & chips and the Dublin sandwich. .. they were both great.    Next time we are in town we will definitely be going back and hopefully getting Brianna again. It's hard to get great service these days so thank you so much! !!",

I had the fish and chips and the fish was delicious and with a really neat presentation. A touch on the salty side... keeping it in mind that it's opening night. Nice selection of draft beers and really friendly waiters and waitresses.  My neighbor had the duck poutine and that looked AMAZING. He also had the deviled eggs and said that was the best he had that night.  Will definitely be going back when they work out the kinks.",

    "text": "After a long car ride my bf and I came here for a late night bite to eat. I am a huge fan of Gorden Ramsey food shows and I was excited to try his restaurant. So I came here with high expectations. The environment is great and I loved the feel of this place. The hostesses and waiters were all dressed in new paper costumes.   Food  First thing that came out was the hand made soft pretzel. The presentation was great  and it was good. I am not a big fan of pretzels but it was quite good. It came with a tray of spicy horse radish melted cheese and pub mustard or was it some sort of butter.   Pork Belly:  This was surprisingly pretty good. The flavor was delicious it had a fatty, crispy, and just enough salty flavor. I recommend this dish for those who are not afraid of a fatty dish.   I ordered the Beef Cheek Stew. The meat was very tender and it melted nicely as it was in my salivating mouth. It was a bit on the salty side and it came with only four pieces of potato fries. I wish there was a little more starch in here to help balance the saltness.   Sticky Toffee Pudding: I read yelp reviews about this dessert and I am so glad that I ordered it because it was food orgasm in my mouth. It was a warm ooey gooeyyy toffee pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream YUMMAY. Highly recommend this. I would just come here just to eat this dessert again.   Our server seemed to be tired or ready to clock out. He was not very attentive and did not really describe how to use the ipad to order drinks. Lucky, being computer  savvy we were able to figure it out. I also ordered their whiskey sour. It was eh okay.  Overall, the experience was nice but I guess I expected more because it was THE Gorden Ramsey. At least the place is clean, food was not over or under cooked, and the environment was great.",

I got the burger, which was a thick piece of meat and it was cooked well done just the way I like it. Service here was one of the better ones I've had on the Strip.   I know some people are weirded out by the fries, but I loved them. They're cut and shaped like large potato wedges. There were 4 to the plate and it honestly looked like a potato quartered and cooked. Yum!  I'd come back here in a heartbeat.",

It was quickly served but was greasy.  See posted photos. Edible?  Sure.  Best we've had?  No way. Cost: $18.  Next we ordered something different in theme with and saluting British food.  Bangers and Mash.  This meal consists of three different sausages plated within a double scoop of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were good. The sausages were essentially flavorless and they were a bit undercooked and tough.  We both agreed we would not order this again.  Cost: $25.  We could prepare the same meal at home for $4, and it would be a lot better.  My wife is a 5 star chef, so we routinely taste and rate meals which can be a challenge to prepare correctly. Yes, this is Vegas, but we are expecting superior quality food and great flavors, which are prepared correctly.  Here we didn't get it.",

    "text": "My birthday was coming up and I happened to hear about the opening of this restaurant. I have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak and it is amazing, so I knew right away where I wanted to go. I brought along 11 of my friends to share the experience.  The service is pretty fantastic. They all learn your name and take the time to chat, they even put on fake British accents when they heard us doing it. My water glass was never empty and they even had the entire restaurant sing happy birthday to me. There are two menus, the grill menu which is a bit pricier and the pub menu which has yummy pub food. We ordered off of the pub menu. Since we were such a large party, we tried a lot of food!  Fish and Chips - The fish is so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious! OMG! I didn't care so much for the garlic on the chips. I love garlic, but they tasted like they had been rubbed with raw garlic, not my favorite.   Shepherd's Pie - The mashed potatoes were so buttery delicious. Everything really worked well together, it was easy to see why this is a signature dish.   Duck Poutine - The fries and the duck gravy were phenomenal. There were bits of duck that were a little overdone so didn't add much to the dish, maybe if they were cooked a little less it would have worked a little better.  Trio of Pretzels with cheese and mustard - Two of us ordered this appetizer and the bacon cheese pretzel was fantastic! The mustard was a bit too spicy for my liking and the cheese spread it a little weird, but not too bad. This dish is not worth ordering because they bring the exact same thing to the table for free, except the free one has a small loaf of pumpernickel bread and butter instead of mustard. I can't believe they charge for this and then bring almost the exact same thing to the table for free.   Mac and Cheese - Almost everyone at the table ordered this and the response was 50/50. I was expecting a warm and rich mac and cheese, unfortunately, there was a really sharp cheese flavor which turned me off.   Short rib and Cheek sandwich - My friend ordered this and passed it around the table. The meat was tender and delicious and there was a horseradish sauce that really added a kick.  Sticky Toffee Pudding - You really must try this! It is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the table stole a bite and enjoyed it.  Overall, there were a lot of hits and some misses. We did have one big thing that turned me off a little. My sister in law ordered a burger, they forgot the bacon and then the burger was almost raw. She sent it back and by the time they brought the new one everyone was finished eating. She asked them to just box it up since we were finished. I would have liked to see that taken off the check since she didn't even get to eat with everyone, unfortunately this didn't happen and I was not comfortable asking.   There are some great dishes on the menu, the restaurant has a really cool vibe, and the service was pretty good. This is definitely a cool hangout for some yummy upscale pub food, but Gordon Ramsay Steak is where it's really at!",

The Truffle Chips were really pretty good but when it came to Fish & Chips, that's another story.  The fish was a pretty thick piece with a very light batter that made it seem out of proportion and not cooked properly.  The taste was okay, but when you pay these prices at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant you expect a lot more than okay.  We had two waiters that took turns waiting on us so you would expect good service but again, it was okay at best.    Wow, what a bummer.",

I was lucky enough to have the one server behind the bar who really took care of his customers but the rest of the Hipsters working behind the bar, they were more interested in talking to and impressing eachother than taking care of the customers. There was a definate lack of Management on my visit.   A pint of draft IPA $13, I could buy a 6-pack of this beer for $10. Cheeseburger and fries $19. I would rather have a 5-Guys burger with it's better tasting meat and many toppings and bigger, better tasting fries all for half of the price. I just can't believe that Chef Ramsay has tasted and approved of this food. But after eating at his namesake Gordon Ramsay Restaurant at the London Hotel in Hollywood (Restaurant has closed) maybe he has found a way to make money on hipe alone.  So everyone, don't waste your money here. I guarantee you that if you order the cheeseburger at the hotel coffee shop you will be eating better than at GR Pub and Grill. Someone conduct this burger challenge and post your results on Yelp. I would like to know how it goes.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I read the reviews PRIOR go going here.  Overprice - ehh, it's Vegas, and it's Gordon Ramsay, so what.   What was constant in other reviews was the service.  I thought, you know, worth a try, could be start up pains.  Well, WOW.  Very disappointed with the front of the house.  We had reservations, showed up early, and they were clearly confused looking up reservation on the computer and an iPad, so stand to the side.  A manager type (noted as a manager by not wearing the newsprint jumper mini dress all other hostess were wearing) asks \"may I help you\".  Tell her we were told to wait, she asks for name again, and then with an attitude, tells us, \"for 7:45\"  (it was 8:25 and we had an 8:30).  I reply 8:30, she walks away without saying a word.   Eventually we're seated, smack in the middle of the dining room that is visible from the casino, good table, near a POS/waiter station.   18 minutes later - yes, eighteen, the waiter comes by, politely greets us, asks about drinks, but we didn't have a drink menu.  He was trying his best, but good service is not solely the poor waiter's responsibility.      When we placed our drink order, we placed our entire order (app, 2 entrees).   Bread plates were provided, then breads were brought.  Breads were finished, so empty crock, tray and 2 small bowls for sauces remained on the table.  (did I mention the waiter station/lsland 6 feet from us).  Our appetizer came, long plate, used our bread plates for serving plates.  Finished, and now all those plates were still at the table.  Our entrees came, after having been walked around to the dining room with the beer barrels (cause I saw the food go by me first, then come back).   Plates were set, we moved our bread plates to the side on top of the appetizer long tray - and there they remained.  The only redemption was the food was good.  My husband ordered Shepard's Pie, which I wish I would have ordered as it was very good.  I had fish and chips, which, one of my fish got soggy at the bottom, but another was crispy.  I read critiques that the chips weren't authentic - I liked them.  My guess if I had to replicate at home, is that you take 1 potato, make it a thick steak fry - so 1 potato = 1 fry; and they probably use the rest of the sides for the mash, but I liked them.  There was another manager type, male this time, (manager noted by his not wearing the punk suspender type clothes waiters were wearing) and this guy looked so sleazy .  Sweaty - seriously, like the kind Gordon rips to shred on Kitchen Nightmares.   I actually told my husband it looked like the KN in NY where this godfather type guy wore the trench coat and glasses and they owned a lobster house, and argued with Chef about \"maine lobsters\".  This guy seriously went to the table behind me, about 12 times.  And please, I'm not knocking appearance, I'm not a barbie type person, but I do expect people regardless of age or size, to look presentable, meaning, clothes fit properly, clothes are clean & neat.   Not sure what the couple did or who they were to warrant attention every 7 minutes, but obviously this clueless manager couldn't turn his back and see a stack of empty plates at our table while we were trying to finish our entrees!  Almost thru our meal, the waiter came buy, said could I take those plates, since you've been staring at them your entire meal.   Again, he was waiting every table in that dining room, and he was hustling, but no support!  At one point when we finished our meal, he ask someone when he saw us finish, to please bus our table - and he did, about 10 minutes later.  Never did I think a pub meal would take 2+ hours.  Again, it's Vegas, so yes, it's over priced, but shamefully not worth it.  I won't be back.  The poor front of house isn't a testament to starting pains, it's poor execution and leadership.  I'll keep watching the damn shows though!",

    "text": "We haven't been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before but we were expecting a good experience. Boy were we wrong. Some of the food were pretty good, I'd give that 3 stars, our server was awesome - I give her 5 stars, everybody and everything  else 0 stars...   First of all, we went at 5:45 to get a table for 3 - with lots of empty tables in the restaurant they tell us, they can't accommodate us until 9:45 that night. We weren't that hungry so we decided to take the 9:45 reservation. When we got there again, we had to wait to be seated because it seemed like they didn't even know which tables were available.   We finally got seated at approximately 10:15 and the hostess gave us ONE menu for a party of three. Okay, you might be busy and ran out of menus for the moment, but you should give us two additional menus ASAP. She never came back, and every other party around us had a menu for per person in their party. My friend saw a hostess with extra menus in her hands so she flagged her down to give us the menus. She had the nerve to say, \"I'm sorry, we usually only give ONE MENU PER TABLE.\" - really?! That's a ridiculous excuse...if you can't think of something better, just say sorry and hide behind the counter or something. Oh yeah they ran out of water as they were filling our glasses so one of them was half full and they never came back to give us more...  We finally placed our order probably at 10:30. We ordered pub crisps (pretty good, might be a little too oily), mini sliders (I tried one that was overcooked, the meat was so dry), duck confit poutine (best dish of the night), a burger, and fish and chips (if I had read the review that all fish dishes were crap, I wouldn't have ordered this) and two drinks. During the 1+ hour that we were waiting for our food, we decided to order desserts ahead of time because we were afraid that would take another hour. We ordered the sticky toffee pudding and triple chocolate trifle - both were very good. We also got the peanut butter and jelly but that was too sweet for our taste buds.   We ordered at the same time as this table of two girls that the bald manager guy snuck in after we were seated. But their food and drinks came way earlier than ours.   We finally got our drinks at 10:45 and we didn't get any of our food until 11:44. That's over an hour after we placed our order, and people who were seated after us got their food, one table even paid and left already. Our food didn't even come in the order that the food should arrive, we got appetizers and entrees at the same time. At least they didn't bring us the dessert too.   A different manager came with the people serving our food. My friend just started to complain about the poor service that we had all night. (Aside from our server - we didn't quite catch her name but she acknowledged us, she keeps coming back to tell us she had already asked the kitchen to hurry up and get us our food; she was very attentive and nice to us while we were waiting.) So the manager was apologizing, saying sorry that we had such a bad experience, yada yada ya. And they ended up giving us a free meal.   If we had to pay, I would say the food is slightly overpriced. Portions are small but depending on what you order, the food was pretty good. (DON'T ORDER FISH!!) Unless they fix how they run the restaurant (kitchen and everybody else minus that one server), I wouldn't come back...even if I loved the duck confit poutine, sticky toffee pudding and the potted triple chocolate trifle -_- But they just opened recently, so I might give it one more try (after careful screening of fellow yelp reviewers comments) in the future or if it is still around...  They have pretty judgmental people working there, if you want better, quicker service, then dress up. There was this other table near us, they received the same kind of crap service when it came to food, drinks, and all. They had to wait just as long as we did, if not longer. And they messed up their order on food too.",

    "text": "Was super excited to try this place because I am a fan, but ended up being severely disappointed. Walked up to the nearly deserted restaurant and was told it was an hour and a half wait. The 3 of us found seating at the bar and quickly pored over the menu. In the end we only ordered 3 things: bacon cheeseburger, chips, and a Caesar salad. When the order was put in our server, Ramon, talked to us a bit explaining about how unique the uniforms are. Then he completely ignored us, along with the rest of the staff because they were either talking about their workout routines, diet, or flirting with the waitress with the new boobs. Time passed without so much as a refill. 30 minutes later Ramon said, \"your foods not here yet?\" Clearly the empty placemat was a clue. Another 15 minutes passed and he woke up out if his stupor to again say, \"wow, your food still isn't out?!\" 2 minutes later it finally arrived. The salad was more a bowl of dressing with a few lettuce leaves. The burger and chips were extremely bland. It took another 10 minutes to flag down Ramon for the check. When it arrived we paid with 2 cards and cash. I wrote the payments down and even explained it. Well, Ramon pocketed the cash and charged my card double. I flagged him down again and pointed out his mistake. He said he must not have heard me and fixed it. All in all it was a shit experience. I would expect more from a restaurant owned my someone who has shows where he gets people and their restaurants in line. Bottom line: You're better off at a buffet.",

My 4-year-old grand-daughter was sleepy and in a bad mood, but Christopher's interaction with her really cheered her up and made our entire dining experience so much more enjoyable.  The food was great!  We ordered the fish and chips, lamb burgers, hamburger, salmon, curry, and appetizers, as well as desserts.  Every item was excellent!  The soft pretzel and wing appetizers were good, all of our entrees were outstanding, and all of the desserts were perfect.  I do recommend that you dine here at off-peak times for best service because this casino complex is always packed with visitors.  This is one of the best pub-style food places in Las Vegas.

Overall 1 stars. December 26. Unfortunately the service cannot overcome the food since that's why I came.  I would caution accepting high reviews on face value. Appears they must have had a stellar opening and served drinks because the good reviews rarely focused on the Dinner food but liked the bar. Guess it depends on if you are there to eat or drink!  Overall, I left my short trip to Vegas feeling I had wasted one good meal opportunity given the price there are just too many other outstanding choices to waste a dollar or precious time here!

    "text": "I have had two dreams involving Gordon Ramsay's pork belly, and that was just in the last week since I have eaten here.  We went to the pub last week for a nice, relaxing dinner. The restaurant was packed for a good reason, so we weren't able to get a reservation until 10:30PM. The reason why I was willing to wait was because when I went to the hostess stand and asked if they had a gluten free menu, the hostess pulled it out and it was full of GF happines. A pub with a gluten free menu? I never thought this was possible! Oh, but it was, and oh was it amazing.  We ordered their house chardonnay in a carafe. Very reasonably priced and went perfectly with all three of our dishes. It was a strong chardonnay, and I didn't want to stop drinking it.  We started off with the cauliflower soup with curry oil. I am very sensitive about curry. Curry is powerful and if used incorrectly, it can devastate or illuminate a dish. Since we shared the soup they split it into two bowls, no extra fee. The first sip? MIND BLOWING. The soup wasn't soup; it was so light and airy that it was actually like a foam. The curry brought a subtle smokiness to the dish and with the little saltiness from the bacon and sweetness of the caramelized onion, this became one of our top 3 soups. EVER.  Then we ordered their salmon and pork belly as entrees, both which are naturally gluten free. The salmon skin was like a potato chip and the salmon was cooked to perfection. Not too raw in the center and perfectly soft and flaky all throughout. The cream sauce was subtle, not heavy and not overwhelming so that salmon was still the star of the dish. It went beautifully with the mushrooms and other garnishing vegetables.   My husband got the pork belly, the star of the night. Neither of us have ever had pork belly before, and I am now spoiled on pork belly and have very little hope that any restaurant will beat Ramsay's because this pork belly, even with all the fat, melted in my mouth and did not make me ill with greasiness. It was pork butter, and I could have eaten the entire dish had my husband not devour it before me. This pork belly was perfectly cooked and the sauce underneath was not rich was I LOVED because there is only so much my palette I can take before going into to overload. There is too much for me to say about this pork belly, so to avoid the novel, just eat it. You cannot go wrong. Also, grab a side of chips with fried truffle. Best chips my husband has had in the U.S.  Service was phenomenal, manager stopped by to see how we liked dinner, the environment and rhythm of the restaurant was smooth, sexy and upbeat and there is truly nothing I did not like about our experience here. We will absolutely go back VERY, very soon.  Mmmm,...pork butter...  P.S. Throw down your Total Rewards card and save a few dollars!",

    "text": "I never went to a Pub and neither did my parents or my brother, so this was a first.   The place is quite dim, but adds to the atmosphere. The seating is quite unconventional in my opinion. There are the couches or benches that have tables that seem quite low. A taller table would be very beneficial.   When I went there, the service was great and spot on.   The Food: The lamb burger is delicious! Order that sucker as medium rare and you'll have no regrets. I was pleased on how much french fried it came with. Personally I think its around $2-5 over priced, but hey its a dish from an A list chef.  The steak with potatoes and asparagus was very tasty and quite large, and I think it was worth the money. The chicken sandwich is quite gigantic and wast good, not as good as the burger or steak in my opinion.  Only go, If you've been planning on eating at a Ramsay establishment for a while and have the money.   Would I recommend it? Definitely, especially if they wanted to have an experience at a Pub.   I'd give it around a 4.2/5",

After speaking to Randy for several minutes he was able to locate my game, and boy was I happy. Not only was Randy exceptional, his Bar tenders were equally as accommodating. They where very knowledgeable about their beers and were able to help find a new beer that was different from what I usually drink. Overall experience was so warm and inviting that I decided to go back the next night for dinner again. I would highly recommend this place next time your in Vegas.",

    "text": "What a great dinning experience at a restaurant by the famous Gordon Ramsay. I came here with fellow elite Melissa Y. because she had invited me for lunch. I could not resist skipping out on a celebrity chef meal right? I actually came here 2 years ago for a Yelp event and they have certainly made changes for the better.   Before we ordered our waitress Carrie gave us a little run down on the background of the resto in addition to some of her recommendations from appetizers to entrees. I thought that was very nice of her to do that considering some people are clueless as to what they want to order. We started our meal with calamari which was suggested to us by Carrie. It came out pretty fast and I did enjoy it because the breading was quit different than what I'm used to. Typically calamari is more of a flour based breading and I could tell they used bread crumbs possibly? I liked it because it added a bit more texture to it and to add to that the squid was not rubbery which I have experienced at other places. The tartar sauce was had a home made touch to it, it was probably house made? For the entree, I had the pub salad. The protein in the salad was chicken, ham and shrimp. It may sound overwhelming, but it actually wasn't. The amount they put of each was just right, which made the salad still a light option. There was also little bits of apples, chickpeas, and cherry tomatoes which added to the freshness to the dish as a whole. Finally the red wine vinaigrette brought everything together and they did so by putting the perfect amount for the salad. I was definitely pleased because I did not want anything heavy because I knew I was going to have a heavy dinner. As we were eating we saw that a man in a suit walking around the resto asking customers how their food was, I overheard him say his name was Derrick. I assume he was the manager and it just goes to show how much they care about pleasing their dinners. While eating we needed re-fills on our drinks and caught the attention of a server by the name of Sara. Normally I don't like asking other servers for anything because they are assigned a certain area of tables. However, Sara  did so willingly and was very nice about it. She even said if there was anything else we needed to let her know. To top off our meal Chef Scott from Hell's Kitchen came our and introduced himself to Melissa Y. and I, totally unexpected. We were kind of star-struck too at the same time! Lol.. Anyway, this place has definitely improved this time around and I can't wait to be back.",

    "text": "To preface, I will say that my review of the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill is based strictly on their happy hour.  The happy hour runs daily from 2-5 PM, nice because it is on the earlier side of some of the other happy hours in Vegas, allowing for optimal bar crawling if that is your preference.  In my case, I happened to stop in on my last day in town before getting on the road back to Los Angeles.  The bartenders were great, extremely friendly and very prompt when service was needed.  For food we ordered the Truffle Fries ($5) and Nachos ($7).  On the fence about the wings, we were proposed to give the wings a shot and if we didn't like them, we would not be charged for them.  Swayed, we gave them a shot.  Despite the name, they were not breathtakingly spicy.  They did have a tinge of Asian-style sweetness, but all-in-all were pretty good.  The nachos came with a good chunk of meet on top of potato chips.  A little different, more British style, but all around pretty good.  The truffle fries I was quite excited for given that I saw pictures of thick planks of fries on Yelp.  Unfortunately, they were the thin variation, not much different from fries you could get anywhere.  The aioli was good, but I was unimpressed by the fries, especially for $5.  However, my girlfriend enjoyed them.  Drinks were also on special, including champagne, to my girlfriend's pleasure.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located in cesars right next to Mariah and Celine. It's actually a great place for large groups to come because they can accommodate big parties. Also good for people who like the drink beer ( even though it's pricey). They take reservations and make sure you do so you don't have to wait. The waiters and servers are really nice. Our survey Rodney was great!  He was friendly and waived or cake cutting fee!  Because if him I added an extra star.   So why only three stars?  For the food and the price. Looking at the menu its traditional pub food. We ordered steak and ale pie, shepards pie, burgers, fish and chips, bangers and mash and short ribs... Basically almost everything on the menu.  Sounds really good. I never really crave this kind of food but I  thought it was great change. After ordering we were all really excited but the food took forever to come!!  I swear it was 45 mins. Granted we did have a bigger group of 8 but I thought it was still too long. I ordered the lamb burger upon recommendation. For 25 bucks a burger... I expected more. I tried Gordon ramsays burger place in planet hollywood and I thought that was way better. The meat was juicier and was less dry. The fish and chips were good and so was the steak and ale pie. When I say good it's not amazing or a must try. It's decent.  But it wasn't worth 30 dollars a dish. I think they charge for the atmosphere which is great but the food was sub par.    This is a good option if you like pub food and enjoy the atmosphere more than quality of food. We had a great time with great company but I don't think I'll pick to eat at this place again. :)",

We were hungry did a lot of shopping wanted a quick drinks and food.    And we were in the area.  It was busy waited 10 minutes for a table.  The restaurant itself was cool, the decor was \"ragged British\" leather, dark colours, and metal.  The menu wasn't to big but had options.  I went it a caesar salad and onion soup.  Friends had drinks.  Coming to Vegas its all about eating for me, service was ok we wanted to order more drinks but it was hard to get our servers attention, we ended up rushing out.  Food, I had pretty much appys it was ok, I cant say for other menu items because I didn't try it.  Overall it was ok.",

It was fairly packed so I sat at the bar rather than wait for a table (a 15+ minute wait).  It's in Caesar's Palace so it's not cheap.  I ordered a burger and fries (without lettuce, onion and cheddar and added bacon).  It took about a half hour ... Charlie, the bartender, said the kitchen was backed up.  It was good but could have been hotter (I guess it was sitting around for a while).  It was rarer than I like it but tender and juicy.  The experience was okay, not outstanding.",

The chopped salad was off.. there was a ton of shrimp, chicken, ham, and other ingredients in there but it just wasn't good...  :(  The pistachio pesto chicken sandwich was... blah. Bread was hard... too hard on the outside and soaked in olive oil on the inside... I mean I don't know maybe it's supposed to be like that.. and if other people like it that's fine but my husband and I didn't enjoy it. There wasn't much flavor in general in the chicken, provolone, and roasted tomatoes. The tomatoes had the most flavor but not enough of it in the sandwich.   The appetizers however, saved the day. We ordered the truffle fries and the mini lobster rolls. The truffle fries were delicious... and the lobster rolls were good. Not the best but definitely good!   We were very impressed with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse so I had high hopes for this one but it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. Maybe we'll give it another try next time if we have a chance.",

We had a wonderful server, and they were able to accommodate us to help us get to the show on time.    Food was the down side. 2 of us had \"side\" salads. Very expensive and was served in a tiny bowl.  You could eat the salad with 2 forkfuls, no exaggeration and was WAY overpriced, even for Vegas.  2 of us had the short ribs.  It was very tough, had to chew for a very long time.  Short ribs are supposed to be very tender, and I have had them at many restaurants, these were a big disappointment.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless they change the quality of the food.",

    "text": "They have a wonderful deal on the menu where you can choose three items for $15 it is known as the \"Pub Bites\".  I went with that option and loved the choices that I got. It is an even mixture of pub and grill food which is fantastic. and especially in the items where you can get three items for the certain amount- the same goes.  I had a delicious \"White Cheddar Garlic Mac and Cheese (Mini Mac)\" and for people who don't like garlic I wouldn't recommend this but I love Mac and Cheese and garlic so this was great for me because the taste of garlic is definitely noticeable in this dish. This was more of a pub type item with a hint of grill with the added grace ad class of white cheddar and garlic. If it would have only been Mac and cheese this would have been a complete pub food item.  One of the other items I had was \"Smoked Salmon Toast\" which was my favourite of the tree items. However, I like toast to be medium toasty not completely toasty so this was extremely crunchy and even hurt the roof of my mouth a touch but was my favourite. However, this is a typical dish so it is hard to go wrong with.  I also had the \"White Bean Hummus\"which I wanted because the other options such as beer nuts or house marinated olives did not sound appetizing to me. You may not think that white bean hummus would taste different than a regular hummus made from chickpeas... but it does and its great.  Out of the three items I would want the Smoked Salmon again with the toast less toasty :)",

Now the drinks? Whoa!! Had the cocktail with the blueberries and I got drunk off of just one. Whoever made the drinks has a strong pouring arm and I'm not mad at it. The food? Everything came out very quickly. The wings were great, an the lobster roll was delicious  with buttery, grilled brioche bun. The macaroni and cheese was the only thing that was just so-so. And it was still pretty good. I was expected it to be baked but it was noodles just tossed in cheese sauce. All that aside, I will gladly come back. Maybe even later tonight",

    "text": "The food was flavorful.  We had the nachos, the fish and chips, the shepherd's pie, a salad, and the butter chicken.  Also the sticky toffee pudding was good.  I've been to every pub style restaurant in Las Vegas, and this was at least as good if not better than all of them.  I love British food, having lived in England for some years, and was looking forward to having a British experience.  My husband has lived in Canada and was looking forward to authentic fish and chips.  The wait staff were efficient.  They did their jobs well, and the service was prompt.    We had looked up the menu online before arriving, but when we arrived, the menu seemed to be pared down from what we were expecting.  That was a slight disappointment.  Even though the quality was good, it wasn't on par with the cost of the meal.  We had heard this so we were expecting it, and we thought it might be worth it if it truly reminds us of London.  While I'm not sorry that we went, we won't be back.  I don't think it's the type of place that relies on repeat business.  One more comment about the wait staff:  My husband and I always tip 20%.  We feel that if you can't afford to tip, don't eat out.  If something is wrong, a comment to the manager or on Yelp is far more effective than stiffing a wait person.  Our waiter made a comment about money.  It was a deliberate reminder to tip, and it was crass.  I'm sorry if the waiter gets stiffed sometimes and feels it necessary to drop hints about tipping, but it's not my problem.  This is a common practice on the strip, and it's one of the reasons I rarely like to go there.",

This is another overpriced celebrity chef restaurant that hasn't received enough love and attention from it's celebrity chef.  The decor tries to be an english pub, but ends up with a lot of low arm chairs that make eating uncomfortable.  Really it's an American interpretation of a UK pub and is hardly authentic despite the authentic name.  The food was boring and underwhelming, certainly not inedible but disappointing for the price, and doubly disappointing given the name.  I've had plenty of better meals in real English pubs for far less.  Of course it beats the batali/bastianich joints, but that's not saying much.",

On top of it, the high price didn't match the service or the quality. The waiter spilled a drink over an iPhone. Just a horrible experience overall.",

Although it was a while back when I went (Summer 2013), it was the best food I ever had in my life.  The braised beef or whatever I had was AMAZING.  I don't know if it was because of here, but I was on the toilet for the next 24 hours, but it was all worth it.  No joke it was amazing.  My friends salad may not have been the greatest, but the 3 course meal that I got was absolutely perfect.  Not to mention the waiter we had was a really nice guy.  He heard me and my friend were from Hawaii and how big of a fan I was of Gordan Ramsey, he hooked us up with a couple of cups, matches, and I even took the napkins cuz it was all Gordan Ramsey labeled.  This place was by far the greatest restaurant I've been too and I can't understand how it's not rated anything less than a perfect 5.  From the appetizer, meal, and desert...  It was to die for.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.  Better yet, open up in Hawaii please!!!",

Unfortunately, it was one of the worst restaurant meals we have ever eaten. I'm sure that Chef Ramsay would have asked the chef \"what the hell is this s**t\" and then told him/her to \"f**k off\". Soup looked and tasted like dish water...signature fish and chips was obviously frozen with a strange texture and both the fish and chips too greasy to eat with grease puddled in the bottom...had a better wedge salad at chain restaurants. We almost left before being waited on because we waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table.  I wish we had left.  Choosing this restaurant was a very expensive mistake.",

At the Pub, we were greeted with warm, soft pretzels acompanied by whipped butter and cheddar spreads. Beef cheeks were tender and tasty. I normally dislike cooked carrots, but these were prepared well and maintained their snappiness. Shepherd's pie was the standout with shredded, braised lamb rather than the usual ground preparation.   After watching Gordon's \"Nightmare\" shows, it was good to hear he practices what he preaches - each staff member has tasted the dishes they serve, and could describe them well. Our server was also knowledgeable about the Belgian and UK beers.   I was even glad to hear disagreement on favorites - it was good confirmation they were sharing their opinion rather than promoting a certain \"chef signature item.\" To this end, we decided to complete our meal with a blueberry cobbler topped with peanut butter crumble and peanut butter creme fraiche instead of the more traditional sticky toffee pudding.  We'll be back.",

We honestly just stopped for drinks and figured this was a safe bet-place looked cool and there were empty spots in front, perfect for people watching.  I ordered a grey hound and my friend ordered a mojito.  While waiting we realized we could have taken advantage of the happy hour menu which was never mentioned by our server.  (Would have been nice to know.)  After waiting much too long our drinks arrived but we were certain the mojito was wrong-it was in a clear glass, no fresh mint to speak of.  My friend had a sip and she said it tasted like the pre-mixed drinks you can buy in the grocery store in a can.  That is where I suspected my greyhound came from as well judging by the taste-it was horrible.  But if you are going to charge $14 (?) for a mojito at least fake it by throwing in a spring of fresh mint...but mAybe that was too much work.  So, we ordered from the happy hour menu next thinking this was clearly not a mixed drink place-we should have paid attention to the keg-decor and impressive beer offering.  I happen to love IPAs and was excited to see Dog Fish Head on tap...but no...it was out.  It was only 4:00 or so!!  Okay, so I ordered  Stone IPA, also. Rey nice.  Strike two... \"Sorry-we are also out of that.\"  So the only other IPA was Lagunitas which I like.  At $5 (happy hour) it was a deal including the $5 nachos-over the top fattening but good.  I can't believe a restaurant of this caliber had the audacity to serve those so called cocktails we started with-they should be ashamed of themselves!",

I'd say we are both \"amateur\" foodies, but we will go out of our way for good food, never fast food.    The food was great, and a vey ample selection of beer, wine and drinks to choose from- that thankfully they condensed by using an iPad- making it much easier to navigate than a bulky menu.  We shared the duck confit, my husband ordered the beef short rib and cheek sandwich, and I had the fish and chips.  The duck was so tender and sweet, no gamey after taste at all.  My husbands sandwich looked beautiful and the small piece he shared with me tasted wonderful, my fish was amazing.  It was so light and wasn't greasy.  (A silly side note... the ketchup is AMAZING- and I normally hate ketchup)  I've seen other reviews saying it's expensive or that they had long wait times or that portion sizes aren't huge....  my husband is a decent sized guy, 6'5\" and a good 250 lbs and his meal was enough to satisfy.  I am much smaller and almost never can finish my plate, but I could finished this one and we both had room for the BEST dessert ever.... the Sticky Toffee Pudding is definitely a recommendation.    I, personally, appreciated that it wasn't an over sized portion.  Mainly because I hate not finishing my plate and not having any place to store leftovers (our room didn't have a fridge).    The price was on par with all things Vegas in my opinion (at least on the strip).  For the food, the experience and the atmosphere are worth it.",

    "text": "The food was incredibly good and the service incredibly bad. Part of the problem might have been our table placement which was at the back near the kitchen doors. Our waitress served tables around us but also a private room near us. We were able to order a drink, our appetizers and main course. Then after ordering the private room filled up and our waitress became a ghost. We finished the first drink after the appetizer and were never able to order another drink. About 40 minutes after finishing the main course, the waitress walked by dropped the desert menus down and kept walking. After waiting another 30 to 45 minutes (she never came back) I asked someone else if they could get our bill. For 3 people it was over $300, for one drink, no deserts and it took 2 and half hours. This was the worst service I have ever received.",

We got the Crispy Pork Belly app, English Ale and Onion soup, Fish and Chips and topped it off with the (free if you check-in) Sticky Toffee Pudding. Kudos to the chefs!  But really what made our meal was the service, starting with our hostess who seated us, all the servers who brought our food to us, and Rodney, our main server. Everyone was attentive, gave great recommendations, offered a brief description of what we were about to eat, and were personable and kind.   If you're looking for a casual spot with some tasty food and exceptional service-try out this spot when you're in town!",

The bloody Mary's are made with belvedere and they're pretty big.   $15 a piece, and very appealing. Comes with celery, a dill pickle sphere, olives, peppers, and salame all in a hurricane glass. I ordered mine spicy and boy was it spicy. So go mild even if you like chile. I didn't like that the consistency of it was very thick. They need to go heavier on the lime juice and vodka and easier on the tomato juice.   All in all the ambiance was very chill, bartenders were friendly, drinks were okay.",

We both started with Their version of French onion soup, we were starving and it was a good start. I had the braised short rib, very tender and decent, I did have to add a little more seasoning as I'm assuming salt is a lost commodity in Vegas, joking, but a little salt and pepper made it pop. The portion was the perfect amount. The server was great and attentive. The food came out quickly, a little costly but it's expected for a decent restaurant in an expensive quality Hotel.",

The restaurant is definitely one of the more fun ones I've been too. Its designed to look like an eclectic British bar and yet it is somehow still very upscale. It's a bit on the noisy side, but that just adds to the fun atmosphere. Our server was extremely friendly, as was the manager who was circulating to various tables and chatting with guests. My boyfriend and I split the nachos and then I had an onion soup and he had the prime rib. The food was not as great as I would expect from Gordon Ramsey himself but as with most things in Vegas, the expectation and the reality don't always line up. Overall, the food was still an 8/10. The restaurant pretty pricey by normal standards, but by Strip standards, it isn't bad. While we won't be dining here regularly, we definitely wouldn't be opposed to coming back here if we were in the neighborhood, so to speak.",

Each of Gordon Ramsay's Las Vegas restaurants has a different take on this classic English dessert, but Pub & Grill has the BEST take on it.  Each sticky toffee pudding here comes out perfectly warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and sticky toffee syrup on the side. Drizzle the syrup over the pudding to let it soak in. Take a spoonful of pudding and ice cream. Admire its glory. Devour. Repeat. Cry when there's no more.  I seriously dream about this stuff. It's that good. If you're into beer, pair this dessert with an Innis & Gunn (also Gordon's favorite!) and you'll be set for the night.",

My wife and I shared the hamburger, which was very good. For three dollars extra we upgraded to the truffle fries. I was surprised that they actually used real truffle on top. My only disappointment was heavy grease at the bottom of the fry holder, the oils below had a funky burnt taste. I don't eat a lot of truffles however, so maybe this is normal? For a Vegas restaurant in a major hotel, we found the prices to be very reasonable. The onion and ale soup was also fantastic! We ate around 6:30 PM and got in with no trouble (on a Sunday night).  Mariah Carey was also performing that evening, so we were surprised to get in that easy as this restaurant is directly across from the theater.",

Absolutely love the decor, ambiance, staff uniforms, flatware, dishware, etc.  Aesthetically it delivered, especially if you're looking for that \"adult theme park\" feel from Vegas.  Our server Scott was very knowledgeable and professional.  He did point out some menu errors prior to us ordering.  He did a great job considering that his section was full and he was managing relocating a large party due to a leak in the ceiling (it was raining and we know from first hand experience that these things happen...absolutely no big deal at all$ and he was so pro in managing his guests.  Kudos to Scott and staff.  Drinks were good and timely but our food took a loooooong time....especially for lunch.  A party of seven with two rounds of drinks, soup for two as a first course and salad and sandwiches for entrees took over two hours before we left. The menu selections really were well written and tempting but the actual food just lacked magic, flair and spark.  I will say that if I was able to eat red meat I would have sprung for the burger as those bad boys certainly looked good.  I ordered the chopped salad without salami.  It comes with pretzel croutons and they were not what I expected--stale, small and flavorless.  Dressing was good and the dish was well balanced, but just fell a little short compared the environs of the restaurant.  I'm not going to let this impact my opinion and image of Chef Ramsay as I know this is a watered down corporate version of his award winning creations.  No Michelin star here.  Just some Vegas grub.

    "text": "This has to be the biggest culinary disappointment I have yet to experience.   For drinks, we ordered the Mothers Ruin and the Ramsay tonic.  Both were unpalatable and likely among the worst cocktails I have experienced.  Price: $15 for each drink.  Our waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there and we were ignored pretty much most of the time.  Although he did sport a well groomed goatee, he seemed a bit unkempt.  In our group, we ordered the Summer vegetable salad, Shepherds pie, Pub Burger, and  Short-rib & cheek sandwich.  All of the food lacked taste and no one in our group liked anything.  The only flavor came from the Horseradish in the Ketchup, but we had to apply them to soggy, mushy  fries.  For a restaurant whose namesake is a person that judges the quality of other peoples food, I expected so much better.  Looking back, I regret that I spent some of my vacation time and money at the Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill when I could have spent the same amount on Helicopter rides.  My advice, plenty of good restaurants in Vegas. Your money can be better spent elsewhere.",

Great staff and good atmosphere but it does lose a point for being a bit pricy.  Over $50 per person including a drink each is a bit expensive for what it is.  I'm giving it 4 stars but I can see how people gave it a 3 star rating.  Let's call it 3.5 stars.",

Three kinds of pretzel rolls accompanied by an amazing flavored butter and an extraordinary cheese sauce. The burger was flavorful and cooked as ordered, which is phenomenal for any restaurant.  Our group is finicky, so kudos to our superb server, Kimberly, who must have a photographic memory.  The server/runner Lisa Marie was incredibly helpful and sweet. When we left, we felt we had two new friends!  Gordon Ramsay's homemade ketchup (and we're not even ketchup fans) is not to be missed. Michael loves the sticky toffee pudding here. The mac and cheese was over the top fabulous -- duck fat croutons, truffles and three cheeses. Burger with applewood smoked bacon and cheese was awesome.   Photos to follow soon",

It was a disapointment Was not to the standards that Gordan Ramsey would have.  Service: Horrible, after being seated it took long time before our drink orders were taken. Ordering water was a choir and we didnt even get it the way we asked which was how the waiter offered it. The bus or water people had this pissed off look like they did not want to be there. I ordered a bottle beer and it took half an hour before i got it Mind you it was not that busy It looked disorganized and it seemed like the staff really didnt care about any of the customers Even the manager seemed like he avoided everyone. There are 2 menus pub and grill, the server didnt bother explain it I only asked becuase I saw someone else with it. After ordering food that took an hour and they seemed to confuse which tables. No apologies about the delays. We werent asked for desert, refills or if we wanted more from the menu. terrrible service. While we were there, we saw at least 3 customers complaining to manager about the service. At one point a customer got pissed and walked out. You almost want to warn people not to waste there time there.  Food:  the food was average we had devilish eggs and the pretzels which was good. We ordered the Salmon from the grill menu and the Rib and cheek sandwhich The sandwich was good but nothing wow. The salmon was dry,cold and bland. We ended up sending it back. Of course no apolgies for thr food quality. Not up to par for chef ramsey also for what it was, it was overpriced.   Overall, I wouldnt return unless the overhal the entire place.Too bad becuase it seems like it has potential Maybe chef ramsey should come down and film an episode of Kitchen nightmares to fix it. I would recomend going to other resturants at Ceasers.",

My wife opened her menu to find it torn and dirty. Our second server came and so did our drinks, my Guinness had the biggest head ever, I asked it to be topped off server 2 rolled his eyes but did it. My friend had ordered a glass of sparkling wine, but the one on the menu wasn't right, I mean come on update your menu. As to the menu it's not detailed enough 3 of us ordered \"toad in the hole\" but although the server questioned the order he didn't explain how much food it was, plus they were supposed to come with HP Sauce but didn't, when we asked for some they said they didn't have any (order hadn't come in). The food is ok, but the service is just so, so. One staff member was standing near us drinking Starbucks (bet Mr Ramsey would have something say about that on his TV Show if it was somebody else's restaurant). In the ladies toilets one was damaged and not in use, in both mens and ladies toilets they had huge wicker baskets to put your paper towels in, they looked stupid and tacky. All in all a bad experience.",

Beer is beer, I don't need to elaborate here, I hope. Apps were good, pretzels with beer cheese, scotch eggs, and lobster rolls. I knew the lobster rolls were fresh because some dumb ass left shell pieces on it, pick that shit out and it's delicious. Moving right along, for entrees, we got the bangers and mash. The bangers were about the size of an average man's penis. While the ladies are laughing and the guys are thinking \"wow those must be huge,\" I'm going to be busy describing the taste. The bangers tasted fucking awesome, unlike the average man's penis (or so I'm told.)  The mash...well it's mashed potatoes. If I have to describe mashed potatoes to you, then you're obviously looking for the wrong restaurant. There's a white castle within walking distance, you neanderthal. Anyways, overall the meal was pretty fucking delicious, price was worth it, too. Basically, just fucking go here, you bloody wanker.",

    "text": "We almost didn't go here because the reviews said it was hit or miss. My husband and I decided to try it for happy hour. At first, when it took 15 min to get a draft beer and a soft drink, we could understand the reviews. We ordered deviled eggs and devils on horseback. The deviled eggs came out. They were great. Then the manager came out and said they had burned the bacon on the 2nd appetizer. He apologized and gave us 2 little dishes of chicken pot pie. And the devils on horseback came out within 2-3 min later.  Just that little thing with the manager made all the difference. It made us feel better and not just part of the huge vegas crowd.  We definitely will go back for a meal next time we are in vegas !",

    "text": "I had high hopes of going here for appetizers and drinks before dinner and was very disappointed.  My brother and I were hungry and decided to give this place a try.  The menu was very limited when it came to vegetarian options for me, but I decided to order the soft pretzels.  My brother asked if the mini burgers or truffle fries were better since he was not very hungry; the server suggested he get both and would not comment further.  I asked what wines they served by the glass and when he mentioned there was a Malbec, I inquired what the price was.  The server quoted $9-11.  I said ok.  Our food arrived and the pretzels were a variety including plain, herbed and bacon/cheddar.  I told the server I was a vegetarian and he looked shocked.  He did replace it with another plain one, but the pretzels were rock hard and I could barely bite into them.  My brother enjoyed his mini pub burgers, but there were items on the burger not listed on the menu.  We were mostly ignored after we made it clear we were only there for appetizers.  We were sitting at a highboy table, with uncomfortable chairs.  I received the bill and was charged $13.50 for my glass of wine.  I didn't even bother to bring it up because I just wanted to get out of there.  I would not go back or recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "This place was a terrible disappointment. My girlfriend and I stopped by on Friday night on our way back to our room for some drinks. We went into a nearly empty bar and sat at a table for two only to be chased away by a waiter who said tables weren't open seating. We should have left right there. Instead, we went and sat at the bar. I ordered a Goodbye Blue Sky and she ordered a Margarita. My drink was bitter and lacking in any other flavor. Hers was served in a small glass that was half filled with ice. There seemed to be very little alcohol in either. For this, we were charged $15 for each glass (one bad drink and one tiny one). I've paid more other places, but gotten more and better and I came away happy. The next night, we stopped by Numb instead. We had drinks that were better tasting, and stronger for less money. Don't go to Gordon Ramsay's!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, but his newest head chef (Hell's Kitchen Winner - Ja'Nel Witt) has her work cut out for her. Three of us went during a NOT busy lunch. The service was friendly, but nothing special. The braised cheek sandwich was phenomenal and the clear winner at the table. The fish & chips were tasty, but the mushy peas were under seasoned. The bangers & mash were disappointing b/c the bangers lacked flavor and the mash were under seasoned. However, the biggest disappointment was that after ordering the appetizer (burger sliders w/ an unpopular spread) w/ the mains... THE APPETIZER CAME OUT AFTER THE ENTREES!!! Since we ordered everything at the same time, I can only assume the fault lies in the kitchen and not w/ the server. Even more disappointing is that they CHARGED US for the late appetizer! The server apologized for the inconvenience, but are you kidding me?! Chef Ramsay has higher standards than that. Best of luck & congratulations Ja'Nel!",

I guess they had a couple bad experiences there before but I really wanted to go because I was wanting a good beer n some simple unpretentious food.  I'm glad I went. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I started with the mushroom salad on a bed of frisee. I really love mushrooms, so when I say four or five different kinds, I gasped, and dived in. I didn't come up for air until It was finished. Oh what fun that was. And the pretzels were a nice touch, I liked the mustard far better than the cheese, surprisingly. I ordered the chorizo mussels for dinner because I'm a big mussel fan and the waiter recommended it.  Very good even tho I hardly ate the chorizo bc that was the only part I wasn't interested in somehow. The broth was salty but savory and it was gigantic.  My friend got the pork belly which had wonderful flavor and the fat was super crispy, I liked it more than him I think. The other guest ordered the shepards pie and said it was great.",

We always try something different - Yesterday was wings (ordered extra crispy, came out perfect) with a perfect spicy sauce. Another ordered scotch eggs which were a bit odd to me but everyone else loved them and it was a perfect mix of crunchy and savory. Special orders are no problem - one of our party wanted a blue cheese martini and the olives came out just crammed with bluey cheesy goodness.   Folks the price is right, the location is great, the food is wonderful, and this is a great Gordon Ramsey option.",

    "text": "It's just okay.  First meal in Vegas after checking into Caesars.  Love the location, and the service was excellent.  The food was just okay though, and FYI, I think the menu online is outdated.  I got the Hell Burger, which was a spicy beef burger with jalapenos and habanero.  It had a delicious smokey flavor, a nice bit of heat to it, and it was juicy.  The patty was perfectly round though, so it makes me wonder if they were using prepackaged food or not.  Nothing on the menu said fresh, hand-made patties though, so can't blame them if they aren't.  Gordon Ramsay wouldn't expect any less though.  The fries were really good though.  My gf got the classic fish and chips.  We both agreed that the fish was perfectly breaded as it was light and crispy, but the fish itself was plain.  You really had to dip it in the sauces to give it any flavor.  Not sure if this how it's supposed to be or not.  They also give you wedge fries, which weren't as good as the shoe string fries I got with the burger.  The best thing we got was the lobster roll starter.  I love the buttery, toasted bread that it comes on, and the lobster is the cold style type.  It was very refreshing, and was topped generously with lobster, so you got a lot of flavor in every bite.  I'd probably try the other places in the area before coming back here, but that doesn't mean this was a bad spot.",

Stuffed full of meat and the bread is perfectly toasted-these rival those you'd find in Maine. The kale salad is also really good-the dressing makes it. The fish and chips are also a solid choice. The fish was crispy and cooked to perfection and surprisingly the mushy peas are quite tasty. The fries, however, were a bit limp-perhaps this is how the Brits like them. A bit loud-lots is TVs give it a sports bar vibe and we were here during March Madness so what do you expect....still I'd come back, the nachos looked fantastic-still regretting I did not try them! We ended with the sticky toffee pudding....wow! All I can say is that I will be dreaming of that for a very long time time-so delicious-the ice cream melts into the tender date cake and the caramel sauce (generous portion) is soooo good!!!",

At this point it is 90 minutes after our reservation time and we still haven't gotten our main course.  While the food is outstanding, the service is not so I won't be coming back.

The restaurant is located in the casino area with somewhat open seating where you can watch the action or there are some tables and booths that are a little more private though close together.

I saved some room to try the sticky toffee pudding (free with yelp check-in) which was amazing.  I couldn't eat all of that either but did enjoy it.  Service was excellent throughout my meal.

This was not that. Had the steak pie, it was okay-ish, honestly the one you take home from waitrose is better. It weirdly  came with a side of raw, random vegetables (seriously who eats raw courgette?) and also weirdly a pretzel... pie should always come with chips or some type of potato...if I wanted potato it would have been another $11... bloody cheek!   My friend had the fish and chips. The chips were good, the fish was not. It was American style and not proper English. Think if you're going to have the cheek to charge $30 for fish and chips, they better be awesome.    The bar staff were okay to us but really really rude to this other poor couple who asked for a drink - they had a table in the bar area and had waited for about 10 mins with no service.  The man came up and tried to order a couple of beers and was told that he needed to go back to his table and wait for his server and have some patience! Poor bloke sat there for another 15 mins before he got a drink.    Glad I went to Burger before I went to Pub because I dont think I'll be heading to any Gorden Ramsey resturants again",

The dessert didn't disappoint-You get a chocolate cake with ice cream and toffee slightly drizzled on top. Really yummy!!!   This restaurant is right in the casino right by Omnia.

    "text": "This restaurant disappoints and a lot of ways and it exceeds in a lot of ways. I think I'll start with my disappointments, so we can end this on a positive note. The initial waiter we had was rude. When he came over to take what I thought to be our drink order. I asked him two questions. First, is the tea just typical tea or is it specialty flavors? I also asked if the onion soup was a dinner portion or did they have a half order to order at the start of the meal. He said to me I don't know what you mean by specialty tea, the tea here is just tea. He then said the menu only has one size a soup and so \"we only serve one sizes soup\". When I responded back I was borderline snapping back. So, we place the drink order and we order two soups as a starter. Well, he just continues to stand there. He's blurts out what do you want for dinner? I said \"oh you're taking our dinner order now\" and he said \"of course\". He was very rude. Well, I think he realized he wasn't going to get a great tip from us and he passed our table over to another waitress. Which she was very pleasant, however you could have been a rock and been more pleasant then this man. Finally, we were seated next to the server workstation it was in the middle of the room it was not blocked off it was just a basic banquet type stand and they were sorting silverware and waiters and waitresses were coming up and chit-chatting and customers were walking up and asking for things. This service station should be away from customers views. Especially, with the prices and this place. The steak I ordered was $48 it came with a small very small order a mashed potatoes that was under the steak and you could not even see it whenever the steak was placed in front of me. My fiance ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which again was very expensive for a burger over $25 is a lot and it came with nothing but the burger so he had to order fries which was an additional $12. Here is the good the restaurant is extremely beautiful and they have beautiful chairs that are very comfortable. The Ambiance is amazing aside from the waitress station being in the middle of diners. The soup was very good and was jam packed with flavor. The steak was cooked perfectly to a temperature of medium rare the flavor was excellent. Once, my fiance's Burger was remade and put on a proper Bond he really enjoyed his Burger and being that we have eaten at several Gordon Ramsay restaurants the Truffle fries was delicious like always. We finished with the promotion offered by the restaurant for checking in via Yelp the sticky butter cake and it was delicious. It actually is my favorite sticky butter cake I've ever had. So, here's a recap the wait staff needs to work on their manners and realize that this is a service industry and the restaurant itself needs to move the waitress station out of the middle of the dining room. The kitchen needs to make sure that all orders go out perfectly the first time and keep up the good work as far as they're cooking. We would definitely go back, however it wouldn't be something we would go to often it's just far too expensive for pub food. I would definitely give it a shot if you're looking for a great dinner in Las Vegas",

First the service was extremely slow, it took almost 10 minutes to have our waiter take our drink order, which by that time we were also ready to order our food (there were maybe only 6 or 7 other tables). When we ordered our drinks we asked for a chocolate milk for our daughter, which they said they had. It was made extremely clear that this was for our 3 year old. A little bit of time after that we received our drinks, and everything seemed fine. But my daughter took a sip of hers, and said it tasted funny. I took a sip and was absolutely shocked that it had alcohol in it! We brought this to the attention of one of the staff who was quick to grab our server. He apologized, and brought over the manager. He said that for some reason the bartender thought we wanted an alcoholic beverage, and used the chocolate milk mix from one of their alcoholic shakes. First of all, it was explicitly clear this was for our 3 year old, second we ordered a chocolate milk, there was absolutely no mention of alcohol in that order. The manager apologized again and brought over another chocolate milk (non alcoholic). My husband and I were in such disbelief over the situation we didn't even know what to do. We received our food, which took quite a long time, and it wasn't as delicious as I had hoped it would be, but I can forgive that. What I can't is the fact that my daughter was served alcohol, and then we weren't even offered anything by the manager, we even had to pay for the chocolate milk!!! I expect much better service from a place with the Gordon Ramsay name. Needless to say, we will never go back!",

We paid our bill and gave a normal 20% tip and didn't even get a thank you or a you are welcome as we thanked him. Not worth it. I rather of spent my money elsewhere. Should of had the fish and chips at the Gordan Ramsey fish and chips place near the strip for half the price.",

I can't say I was thoroughly impressed, nor was I dissapointed by any means. I had the 14 oz Ribeye w/a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were excellent but the quality of the ribeye was satisfactory. Although I'll admit, the three sauces that come w/the steak were great, along w/the asparagus. I also tried the kettle chip nachos and they were good...just wish there were more meat on it than what was given. To me, price was slightly high for what you get. Overall, it was an average quality place for both food and service. I wouldn't turn this place down if given the opportunity...but then again, I wouldn't volunteer this place either given the choice.",

I didn't drink but my sister's did and said the drinks were good.  The decor is nice, the workers uniforms are ridiculous, lol, I felt bad for them, but it is a very English look.    The big bonus to this was though that on occasion Gordon Ramsey himself comes in to check on things, and at the time we were there so was he.  My sister is a big foodie and we were stoked that she got to get a picture with him.  He is very nice and personable in person although I didn't get too close because I couldn't get past my terror and PTSD of watching him scream at people on TV.  lol.  Overall it is a great place.  I'd definitely go back both for the Super Bowl, or just for dinner or lunch.",

We arrived around 7pm, were seated immediately without reservations, and were well-monitored by relatively friendly staff. We both got the fish and chips with some drinks. There were four huge fillets of fish and plenty of chips (fries), and everything tasted great. No disappointments! We should have split the dish (and I wish our server had warned us of the portions but it was our responsibility to ask). The beer and my cocktail were good (I got the mocha martini) but both arrived at the end of the meal, which was annoying . However, our server apologized for the wait, explaining that the bar was backed up. I liked the decor of the place, the servers' and host/hostess's uniforms were really cool classic British punk themed.  My only significant complaint is regarding the few tables behind the host/hostess counter. The table was very high compared to the low-resting chairs and made for an uncomfortable dining position. The table was also a bit wide and it was difficult to have a more intimate evening when we were seated so far apart and had to have a shouting match over the casino music.  We may be back again but I want to check out Ramsay's other establishments.",

    "text": "We had to visit at least one of GR's restaurants in Vegas so we chose this one.  5 of the 6 of us had the prime rib, the 6th (damn combo-breaker), had something else which I don't remember.  In any case, the meal was excellent. The prime rib was perfectly marbled, had the right amount of seasoning and tasted exactly how it should. I will say, generally speaking, either restaurants don't know what the hell \"medium rare\" means or they're afraid of getting sued if someone eats meat too underdone and gets sick. Medium-rare seems to be always served as Medium.  The Yorkshire pudding that came with it was also excellent. Fluffy and flavourful. I don't see this served with prime rib in other restaurants as much as I'd like to.  The service was adequate but not spectacular by any stretch. Drinks came in a reasonable amount of time, as with the food. Refills were a touch slow.  The price was a little bit steep but not in outer space by any means. Enjoying the food makes it easy to forget how much it cost.  I'd say that you should check this place out on the strength of their prime rib alone.",

    "text": "Contrary to most of the reviews for this place, I found GRPG to be a refreshing change of pace to the stuffiness (or severe lack thereof) of most Strip restaurants.  What I found most impressive was that they cater to everyone. If you're looking for a fine dining experience, get a bottle of meritage and the veal chop. If you want a beer and some fish and chips, they can do that too.  Speaking of fish and chips, they were phenomenal. Fat pieces of cod, seasoned perfectly, coated in boddingtons beer batter and fried to a perfect crispness. The homemade chips are tossed in herbs and Parmesan. Ask for a side of garlic aioli to dip them in. It's a revelation. But honestly, the best thing on that plate were the bright green and buttery mushy peas. They had such a beautiful freshness to them and really tasted like...well...peas! But the best peas you've ever had.  We also had the shepherds pie. Down home goodness with a British flair. The use of lamb along with beef adds such a depth of flavor. Also, instead of using ground meat, the chefs braise it, so you get a nice stew like texture and flavor galore. The potatoes were creamy and rich and the vegetables inside were a perfect al dente.  We finished this feast with the sticky toffee pudding. Just get it. You are missing something divine if you don't.  Our server, Elyse, was kind, quick witted and on top of it. She anticipated our every whim. And a huge shout out to Raul and the amazing bar staff for such genius cocktails. These guys know what they're doing.  All in all, this place rocked it.",

    "text": "So this is my fourth time visiting this restaurant and finally decided I had to write a review. Firstly the food and service has always been great with the exception of the Fish and Chips. If there is one thing a English Pub should get right it should be the fish and chips. First time I ordered them I was presented with frozen McDonalds type fries and I was horrified, actually pissed off that I had been served those type of fries instead of chips. Next time I ordered I was told they had gone back to chips however it may not last because customers were complaining perhaps due to the American palet. I was thrilled they now had chips so Gave it another try. I must say here that the fish was honestly incredible and authentic but the \"chips\" while being wedges or chips of potatoes they were not hot and were heavy and wet without flavor. I grew up in England and if anyone has eaten at an English pub or \"chipper\" you know you cannot stop eating the huge portion of chips, they are like candy.  Today I ordered Bangers and Mash which has always been one of my childhood favorites. My first bite I was expecting the deliciousness of the English Banger but instead tasted Polish Sausage. WHAT? Gordon come on really? There were however bangers there also thank goodness however my opinion the onion gravy was thick and congealed not thin and smooth like it should be and while the sauerkraut was an interesting touch I still don't understand why stray from one one the most authentic English dishes. It has been perfect for centuries why add Polish sausage? All the other appetizers I've had here are awesome and the burger is simply amazing, however I will go to Todd English Pub at Aria to have the most authentic fish and chips and bangers and mash this side of the Atlantic.",

As for taste the fish and chips and the chicken we're good. The chicken taste was unique and good the fish was very good, the fish meat was good. The peas with the fish was a little wierd. Salmon was good, just not enough on it's own for me.",

    "text": "Happy Hour allowed us to try a few different items without having to shell too much money out of our already emptying pockets (the flashing lights of Vegas really get ya). All the food on the happy hour menu is from $5 - $7, which is pretty decently priced for the richness of the selection. You do have to sit at the bar, which was super crowded on this cold November Tuesday, but if you can manage to find a spot it'll be worth your while.   Each dish was delicious! We were blown away. They were all classic happy hour appetizer type foods (nachos, wings, etc) but made with better quality and a slight twist of the fancy. The type of food you can eat until you're full and not feel like you're going to pass out after, you just feel good.   Here's the dishes:  Truffle Chips: Basically, fries with truffle aioli. The fries are super good, those thick but not too thick ones that are just crispy enough. The truffle, and the other dipping sauce, was flavorful too.   Toad-in-the-Hole: A sausage wrapped in a pastry with dipping sauce in swirls around the plate. Fluffy, pastry with perfect balance of sausage. This dish only comes with one tiny sausage for a $5 price tag, so just be warned if you're sharing you'd need to order a few more if you want your own.   Crab Deviled Egg (w/ cucumber, tomato, relish): This was good, the flavors were balanced. I'm a hug fan of regular deviled eggs, so the twist was definitely interesting. Not my favorite, but good and definitely worth the try! (They come with three egg halves).   Kettle Chip Nachos (w/ corned short ribs & cheddar sauce): SO GOOD, probably my favorite dish. It's everything good about nachos but with better made parts. The chips by themselves are the real potato kind, the meat is flavorful enough to eat on it's own, and the cheddar sauce is rich. It all balances super well, especially with the sweet baked peppers on the top (I think that's what they are). It was so good we were literally scrapping every last tiny bite off the plate even though it was our last dish of the meal.   Lollipop Wings (w/ Blue Cheese Dip): SO MUCH YES. Comes with 6 wings.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay has quite a few restaurants in Las Vegas. The Pub and Grill was the one we selected for dinner before a show on Saturday night. We made reservations and were seated right away when we got there. This spot looked just like an old pub, classy but still pretty casual.  The waitress offered us some specials and helped us decide on our dishes. She told us that when Gordon Ramsay is there he always gets the Bangers and Mash. I decided on the pistachio pesto chicken sandwich that came with fries. It was delicious! So tasty and the bread was a zucchini cheese bread - yum! The fries were tasty and the ketchup was even better! I don't know what was in it, but it had some type of kick to it. The braised short ribs were also amazing and the risotto with that was so delicious!  There is also a Steak and a Burger spot from Gordon - I will have to try one of those the next trip!",

My Mom is English and lives in London, so we have eaten many pub meals, but this is by far the best! My daughter ordered the Bangers and Mash: substituting French fries for the mashed potatoes and all pork Bangers instead chicken, beef and pork. They were tender and amazing. My husband had a corned beef sandwich with homemade potato chips and it was THE best sandwich he has ever eaten. I had the fish and chips. There are no words! It was unreal. I do not exaggerate. The fish was tender and flaky and the batter was incredible. My daughter who has never tried fish and chips before wants it next time. This is a must in Vegas!",

Dim lighting and cozy wooden kinda feel...with sports games to watch. Our waitress, Daisy, is absolutely amazing and I think our experience would not have been as awesome if not for her. She had a great sense of humor, top notch service, and was completely professional yet personal at the same time.   We ordered:  Lamb shank: This actually brought my friend back to the days when his mother was still around and cooked him this as a young boy. The meat literally fell off the bone, and no knife was needed. An amazing dish, especially one that could trigger such nostalgic memories.  Fish and chips: I loved their thick steak fries--well seasoned and pairs GREAT with their house-made ketchup--trust me, this ain't no Heinz. The ketchup is AWESOME. Apparently they make all of their sauces and you really can taste the difference--the tartar sauce for the fish and chips was also very well done. The fish itself was tasty and yummy, though not our favorite (which is actually a gluten free dish located in Florida), but it still was a winning dish in our tummies.  Baby carrot side: This came with brussel sprouts and bacon lardon--I swear, bacon makes EVERYTHING taste good. This dish was simple and nice as far as veggies go, though I would have liked it cooked a minute or two more to get an even softer bite for the carrots. Still, not a bad side...though I might opt to try another side next time.  Forest mushroom with frisee: It's literally shrooms and frisee. Granted, the frisee is very lightly dressed--just the way I like it and very fresh. The shrooms are delicious and well cooked...but that's really all you should expect. Nothing else fancy thrown in there.  Overall, I really want to come back, say hi to our wonderful waitress, and to try their other goodies. Everything looks amazing...I've been to all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas, and  none of them have let me down yet!",

The entrees ordered at our table were the short ribs, salmon, vegetarian, and fish & chips.  I personally had the vegetarian dish, which was a laughable, tasteless, heap of mix n' match veggies and rice.   No creativity or thought went into that $30 plate of mediocrity.  The other entrees were described as sub-par, and nothing memorable.   I would be mortified if my face was plastered on every cab in Vegas drawing people into a pathetic, Vegas style Applebee's.  However, Gordon has no shame.    On a positive note, the service was fine.",

I've visited many steakhouses in LV and you can get a lot better for less money.   Kinda dissapointed. Will not be back again. Service of the waiters was good.",

Lobster rolls went from three to two and the filling was no where near what it used to be. The ration is way off. The side lobster Mac n cheese was gross...almost like it was sitting out too long and was discolored. The Shepard's Pie had a dozen peas and carrots at most....which is ridiculous. The supposed fresh peas and carrots are what makes the Shepard's Pie. It was over cooked and the pretzel that came with it was hard. Having the pretzel appetizer before it's night and day. Then for the fish and chips....the fish batter was so salty it was almost sent back. Ended up just taking the fish out of the batter and eating it. This is extremely sad as this was one of my favorite places, but it seems that the expectations and standards of this amazing restaurant has gone way down hill.",

We were told that this restaurant has wonderful food and to make sure and try it out if we get the chance.  Since we are on vacation from Hawaii and don't have this restaurant back home.   We went to get a table for five, the hostess was very sweet and asked us to wait about 2 minutes while they set the table for us. We were seated at a super cute table. We all started looking over the menu.   During this time no one came to greet us or offer us water.  We were sat at the table at about 4:37 pm. at about 4:57 pm still no one had come to greet us or offer any beverages.   At about 4:59 pm another table was sat right next to us. This table was greeted offered water within a minute of being seated.   At this time we decided to leave the restaurant because it appeared no one wanted to serve us. As we were making our way out of the restaurant my mom informed the manager of the poor service we had encountered. The manager stood there and looked confused they got out his table map to check who was suppose to serve us. After that he offered us another table but we would have to wait a minute.  By now we were fed up, hungry and not feeling welcome at all. So we left. Thanks for ruining what could have been a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "Let's get one thing clear: I'm not giving this restaurant a one star review for the food.  All four of us really enjoyed our dishes and I do highly recommend the steak and ale pie (which is what I ordered).  Now that that's out of the way, here's the main reason for my one star review:  THEY MADE MY WIFE CRY.  Why?  Because they served her an alcoholic drink when she ordered a virgin one.  While this doesn't sound like a big deal, it is.  She's pregnant.  She was crying, my in-laws (who didn't yet know and had to find out his way) were confused, and I was not happy.  The issue lies in that there is a drink on the non-alcoholic menu that has the same name as one on the alcoholic menu.  The confusion was almost guaranteed.  While we couldn't really taste the booze (it was a pretty weak fru-fru drink), we noticed on the bill.  This mistake was the feather on the cap because even getting into the restaurant was a pain.  We had 6pm reservations, but didn't get seated until almost 6:30.  That, too, was an issue because we had show tickets for 7:30pm.  To top it off, the incompetent hostess initially gave us a table for two when there was four people in our party.  Despite how good the food was, we'll never be back and probably won't patronize any of Ramsay's other establishments based upon the mistakes that were made at the Pub & Grill.",

    "text": "I consider myself being a patient person but when it's a disrespect, then hell no. I simply asked the hostess how long the wait was for a party of two, she writes my name down on a post-it and tells me to wait a second then disappears. I thought she was finding us a table and it felt like we were next to be seated but after seeing parties of 5, 3, 4 & 2 walk by us and seated instead, I simply asked her again what the wait time was and she forgot my name and lost the post-it. Never got a straight answer and could've easily waited there until they closed before getting noticed. I felt like we were being ignored and probably were. The place wasn't too busy and they were all walk-ins that came after us. I don't think they needed my business and I went elsewhere but I felt that issue alone was worth documenting. The food reviews are awful too...glad I didn't spend any money there.",

They served is cold nachos, undercooked and cold sliders and then one burger had a hair in it. The atmosphere was fun and our server was good, but not great. The other items were okay but not worth the $20 per appetizer that we paid. Don't go. Go somewhere else. There are just too many places in Vegas you can spend your money! Like Bobby's burger palace near cvs and Monte Carlo. Much better and only about $10 for a burger!",

I came to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill twice during my recent travels - once just for drinks and snacks and once for dinner.  With that, I think this is a great pub and a great place to have a drink.  For dinner... I would suggest spending your money somewhere else.  I loved the atmosphere and the bartenders all had sexy Irish accents, so that was a nice touch.  The drink selection is great as well.  The whole restaurant has a very rustic and homey feel to it.  The one time we came here for dinner I was underwhelmed by the food.  Mainly, because one person in our party ordered the mussels and at least half a dozen hadn't opened.  Anyone who knows anything about seafood should know that un-opened mussels usually means they're no good and a good chef should never let those out of the kitchen.  When we pointed that out to the server, we just got a shrug of the shoulders. Umm... ok?!  Honestly, I can't even remember what I ordered, so it wasn't that memorable.  My husband had the Shepherd's Pie and thought it was good.  With all the fantastic food choices in Vegas, I wouldn't waste my time here for dinner.  Just for drinks!",

OMG I could not get passed the appetizer menu as it all sounded good. Good is an understatement I decided on the hellfire wings (spicy but delicious) and could not get enough of the sauce ! Then I had kettle chips which were topped with cheese , pulled pork and more, yummmm ! My husband got a burger which he claimed the best burger he has ever had!! Gordon he is hard to please but you did it!! After tasting everything, enjoying the atmosphere, the friendly wait staff and the signature cocktail obviously we went back another night for more!!! Gordon has multiple locations in Vegas that specialize in different dishes and it's easy to see why!!!",

I had the Kettle Chip Nachos for an appetizer. I was surprised how large it was (his apps in Burgr were really small). I couldn't finish it, but it was amazing. For my entree, I ordered my favorite UK dish: Shepherd's Pie. It was served in a round bowl, which I felt looked a little small compared to other's I had ordered in other places, But it was a deeper bowl too. It was really alot. I did finish that because it was too damn good, but I did stuff myself. Funny, I was sitting next to a large group of Caesar's workers dressed as various Romans along with other impersonators such as Dean Martin, Elvis and Sammy Davis, all having drinks.  Weird but cool.",

My awesome friend and I came here after shopping and the service was great.  Our servers name was Mike and he was really tentative and provided great input for the drinks and food on the menu.    Based on his recommendation I ordered the Pub Crawl... I was in the mood for something where I could taste the alcohol.  I never had bourbon and I wanted to try something new... Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there)  So the food.. Uhh so good. For the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b/c I've never had anything like it.  For the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.  I know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.  I can't wait to go back on my next visit!!  We were definitely in food heaven going here!!  I will save a little room for dessert on round 2 and I will try some of Ramsay's other places on the next visit.",

    "text": "When it comes to British-themed gastropubs in the US, this is as good as it gets. Of course, it doesn't come anywhere close to Ramsey's original gastropubs, the Devonshire in Chiswick and the Narrow in Limehouse, London but that's not unexpected.  The menu is a delightful mix of classic British pub favorites and simple seasonal dishes seasoned with a sense of humor; so, if you expect to find fine or upscale dining, you'll likely be disappointed. While the service is an odd mix of attitude, amateurishness, and friendliness, we did enjoy the large selection on tap and some very decent food. I found it silly that they won't let you sub a side dish on a $60 prix-fix that features ordinary dishes from the regular menu but life's too short to worry about that. Also, I'm not a fan of casual restaurants where there's no salt and pepper on the table - even though I'm very unlikely to actually salt my food, I'd like to have the option should I ever wish to do so. This practice has nothing to do with the food or the guests, it's all about the chef's ego. On the bright side, I found it very comforting to have European soccer on and enjoyed some kick-ass music playing.   All in all, be open minded, come to Ramsay's Pub & Grill, don't expect a fine dining experience but rather enjoy a decent casual dinner, have a pint and have a laugh. Also, give yourself a break and stop imagining what GR would or wouldn't do if he were there for you might find you actually enjoy the experience for what it is. (And stop looking for the salt shaker already.)",

    "text": "Well it was my husbands birthday and to treat him to a nice dinner we decided on the newly opened Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill.  I had made reservations for 8pm, but we arrived around 7:30pm. There was a bit of a back up at the hostess booth. They were having trouble deciding who to seat first and there wasn't really in order to it. A little bit chaotic if you ask me, especially for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The restaurant is definitely British themed, no doubt about that. There were a few TV's playing the various games, but other than the medium size bar and the wall of empty kegs, nothing screamed pub. Once we were seated, they gave us the Ipad which had the drinks menu on it. I was fine with water, but my husband ordered a 20 oz Innis and Gunn. His drink was brought over fairly quickly and we decided to order the appetizer, while we decided on our main course. We ordered the pork belly entree to share as a starter. After deciding what we wanted to eat, we placed our menu's down on the table. Our server  came by and took them away without asking or getting our order! I had to flag her down to ask her to bring them back so we could order our food. A few moments after we ordered our entrees, our pork belly arrived. I had noticed that every other table around us had received bread, so I asked if we could get some bread. She said she had put out order for the bread in. We were almost finished with the pork belly roll, with pea puree which was very tasty, when our bread arrived. Around this time the server came over to refill our water glasses, she touched the spout of the water pitcher (which looks like a clear wine bottle) to the rim of my cup. Lucky, she had not refilled my husbands water, so I switched and drank out of his. When she came over to refill 'his' glass, she again touched the rim. I was able to waive down a bus boy and get a straw. Our dinner arrived and I decided to focus on that. I had ordered the lamb, while my husband had ordered the mixed grill, which included, filet, pork belly and shrimp. I had ordered my lamb medium and I felt and that it was on the well side, and I also thought that it tasted burnt. It was charred after all, but my husband tasted it and said it tasted fine. My taste buds are extremely sensitiveness at the moment, so I decided to let it go. My husband was happy with his dish, but the side dishes that we ordered to share got mixed reviews. We ordered the carrots, two ways (roasted and pureed) and the mashed potatoes. Neither side dish was served with a spoon. Keep in mind these are family style dished. Luckily, we didn't mind sharing. So we had to use our forks to get the carrot puree and the mashed potatoes out of the dishes. I was by no means happy about this and than the server came over to refill my water for the third time she not only touched the rims of the glasses but also the straws. In addition every time the server came over to our table she bent down so her face was at my level. I did not like this, especially when she was at the table next to us. When she bent over to them, her butt was in our faces. Not very lady like and not very professional at all. I was pretty much fed up with her service at this point. I walked to the front and asked to speak with the manager. I ended up waiting at the front for at least 5 minutes while being repeatedly told that the manager was on her way. When she finally arrived, I informed her what was going on in regards to our water glasses, and said I didn't appreciate that at all. I also questioned the method of serving side dished without spoons and she said that side dishes were not served with spoons. She said that she would follow me back to the table and observe. I thought the least she would do is have someone bring us new water glasses.  After a few minutes of waiting and never receiving new glasses, the server came over to ask what we wanted for dessert. We turned down dessert and asked for the check. The check in case you were wondering was not discounted in any way and was close to $200. I have now been to \"Steak\" four time, and always rave about it to my friends. Everyone was waiting for my review on the Pub and Grill and I will not be raving about this to anyone. I was so disappointed. Yes, I understand it is a Pub and Grill, it is not Steak, but I think that a little professional can go a long way- especially considering the prices at just a 'pub!' Little things like touching my water glass and then the glasses next tables and back again, doesn't make me very happy. Also serving side dishes that need spoons, without spoons??? This restaurant has a long way to go.  Not Impressed",

    "text": "I have visited Chef Ramsay's other restaurant in town Gordon Ramsay Steak several times so I had high expectations.  We got in without a reservation which was great. Service was just ok.  We are locals and the waiter honestly seemed more interested in finding out our opinion about the city such as houses and where to live as he was new in town.  He was friendly, however he didn't do very much as a server. Once we got our food he was pretty much gone.  The food was honestly a disappointment.  I ordered the Shepard's pie.  Gordon Ramsay is always talking about his Shepard's pie so I wanted something great.  What I got was eh...ok.  It really was just pot roast with severely undercooked crunchy semi-raw veggies topped with un seasoned mash potatoes.  Good idea but severely poorly executed.  The pot roast was super watery making the dish a big mushy mess.  Having ordered sticky toffee pudding from Gordon Ramsay Steak and absolutely loving it, I thought I would order it here and maybe find a possibly cheaper fix to my craving.  I was disappointed.  Sadly the pudding was overcooked and hard chewy on the outside and dry inside.  The place has a good concept, but the wait staff is lacking and the kitchen staff is lacking execution. Next time I want to an English Pub in Vegas, I'll head over to the Crown and Anchor on Tropicana.  A quarter of the price, and taste better.",

The bartender refused to change the station because he was a chargers fan. He was wearing a chargers leather helmet at the time. When we asked to speak to a manager it took over 20 min for Casey who was the manager to arrive and she argued with us about changing the station instead of complying with our customer request. In addition when I asked the hostess in front for a manager she said there were a lot of managers on duty and one of the managers is Brandy. When I asked Casey about this she claimed there was no manager there named Casey. We ended up leaving the bar very upset at the level of unprofessionalism displayed at this establishment by the staff and management. I suggest that Corporate management start sponsoring customer service training for all staff members at this establishment.",

And the short ribs were just as yummy!! A light shared meal which was at we wanted! But Rodney made our night! He was beyond kind and energy to boot! Truly lightened our night!  Found the manager and told him and he was just as nice!  The food-  the staff - wish we had another night to have gone back!  We even loved the silverware!   Gordon knocked this place our of the park if you just want great food - great staff and to enjoy your dining partner in an atmosphere that lets you see the traffic of people but is not overwhelming!!!

    "text": "My wife and I watching every season of Hell's Kitchen religiously since the very first season.  So when we were in Vegas we had to come visit this restaurant since it is where the winner Jeanelle (sp?) will be working starting August 14th I believe.  We were quite excited to come here with our friends and my two children.  We had reservations and when we got there we noticed all of the tables that seat more than 2 people use only high backless stools for chairs.  My youngest is 4 years old and while she could sit up there fine it was not something I really wanted to chance.  There were two cocktail type tables in the middle of the restaurant that were open but they said at first that we cannot sit there because there is no server for those tables.  Really on a friday night you dont have servers for all your tables?  Seemed a bit fishy to me but in the end we were able to sit there although after waiting 15 minutes we had to go back to the hostesses and say the waiter they said would help us still has not shown up.  Once he did show up our waiter was good but not anything special in the least.  The drinks were ok, one of us had a blueberry smash and I had a grapefruit drink from the cocktail menu.  Both again were good but at $15 I thought were a bit overpriced.  I will only speak for my own meal and I got the flat iron steak which was $30+.  When I received it, it looked liked 5 sliced small pieces of steak.  I couldnt believe that for that price the portion was so small.  All in all I think we were all let down by this restaurant mostly for its lack of value, slow and not that friendly service and seating arrangements.",

    "text": "First - the food is exceptional. The problem is with the front-of-house and overall presentation. Arrived 6pm and the place was 75% empty. Seating only by reservation! We had to cool our heels 15 minutes because they do not accept walk up business! I suppose this keeps out the riff-raff but it also keeps out customers. The bimbo squad that act as greeters/seaters are just that - bimbos. Fairly attractive and none too smart or just not well trained. Or both. The drink menu is presented to you on an iPad but the size of drink involved and the pricing does not match what they offer you! Attempted an $8.75 25oz. Newcastle draft off the iPad but could only order a pint at $7.75! Pints were not even on the iPad menu! They mention that this is a 'craft' beer place but it must be relegated to the bottled section as the draft selection is pretty pedestrian. Did I mention the food is outstanding? No doubt, this is what kept this at a 4-star rating. But they serve the entrees in a plate that is almost like a bowl. This makes cutting meat a bit of a challenge. The 2-seat tables are pretty small with little room to manage all the glasses, bread plates, raised wooded placemats, etc AND the freaking iPad. Service was decent by the wait staff. The decor does not match the hype. It is pretty boring and almost ugly unless half-kegs of beer as wall art is your thing. From place settings to 'reservation only' seating this is as far from a friendly, down-to-earth pub as one can imagine. I suspect Gordon Ramsay was involved in the menu and the overall licensing of his name/image and that is about it as part of his overall Harrah's deal. This location in Caesar's was Bradley Ogden's which was an overall brilliant restaurant across the board. Too bad it was replaced with this - which boasts as friendly and inviting but really isn't. But this is all about the food and the food is OUTSTANDING. Just don't expect a Michelin experience.",

First impressions nice atmosphere clean bright vibrant. We sat down with our daughter and waited about 20 minutes for a server to come. I was hungry and went straight away for the toad in the hole and the diver scallops I told the waiter I had not had toad in the hole in over 20 yrs. he explained it was not traditional at which I realized it was basically a pig in a blanket. I changed my order to scotch egg and chicken curry my wife had fish and chips. When the waiter eventually came with the food all at the same time I think a quail egg was used for the scotch egg I got scallops instead of the curry. My wife's food was okay at best for $16 F&E but they cost $30. Scallops overlooked. $180 for two and a half peeps with two drinks each. A lot of dosh for bad nosh, Done!!!!!!!",

The place was crazy busy, and the two hostess babes on duty looked me up and down, and basically said 'no way!' I walked on back to the bar, and eventually wrangled a barstool. I eventually managed to  order what sounded like an intriguing cask-aged 'London Style' Porter from the over-whelmed, inattentive barmen-- which at $13 a pint, was sort of like a watery stout, not any Porter I have previously encountered.  I next decided to double-down and ordered the Pub Pretzels, Pub Burger, and chips.  The Pretzels were pretty good.  The burger was a huge, decently cooked patty, while the 'chips' were mildly soggy steak fries.  So, basically $40+ for a burger and a beer left me feeling liked I had been conned -- even by Las Vegas standards!  If you want pub food, go see The Man -- Hubert Keller's Burger Bar (or even Fleur) further down The Strip will treat you right, and send you on your way happy!",

If he spoke to me the way he speaks to some of the people on the show I'd straight up knock him out.  What a waste of time.  I ended up eating a few bites and giving the rest to my brother.

    "text": "We were visiting my daughter in Las Vegas and wanted to enjoy dinner together.  We picked Gordon Ramsey's Bar and Grill since we wanted to try his famous beef wellington he fusses about on TV.  The place is extremely noisy, had a hard time visiting and catching up.  aBeer and wine were just okay while waiting for the food.  Finally our beef wellington arrived and to our shock it was overdone.  We ordered one rare and the other medium rare.  They both came out at best medium well.  Showed the server and she told us that the chef had told her that it could not be cooked rare or medium rare otherwise the pastry would burn.  HUH.  My daughter is a pastry chef in LV and was so mad with statement from the chef, the pastry was Burnt.  I think he knew it was bad but told server that to make an excuse for the Horrible beef wellington.  I had to send mine back, my daughter was too hungry to wait that long again.  When the new one came out it was decent, not rare but possibly medium rare with the pastry looking good and NOT burnt like the first one and was not hard and burnt like the first one.  That chef should be fired by Ramsey like on TV, he had no idea how to cook a dish that Ramsey always fusses about and if known for.  Only good thing was the truffle fries.  When we got the bill, they did not even comp one of the horrible beef wellingtons let alone maybe our drinks.  For the price a little PR should have been given.  This place is one of the worse places in LV to eat at.",

    "text": "Due to a snafu with another restaurant we ended up at Gordon Ramsay's Pub for brunch. I think it was a happy accident because I loved all the food. We had pigs in a blanket (sausage rolls) and deviled eggs for apps. The sausages were fat and juicy and delicious with the spicy mustard and HP sauce. I ordered a Goodbye Blue Sky cocktail, it was fabulous but probably more suited to someone who likes their drinks tart versus super sweet.  For entrees we had, Braised Short Rib with cheddar mash, Fish and Chips, and Steak and Ale pie. Let me tell you, i t was probably one of the best short ribs I've ever had. It just fell apart and perfectly meaty and savory. I was trying to sop up every bit of gravy on the plate. The fish was perfectly light and flaky, chips appropriately fried potato-y, and the mushy peas as expected. My mum hates them, I think they are great. My DH enjoyed his pie, the crust was nice and buttery. At this point I moved on to one of their cocktails they were offering as a special. When my mum went to order a margarita the server recommended the Napa Valley. I tasted it and in turn wanted one too. It was sweet and I very easily polished it off.  Moving on to dessert we ordered the sticky toffee pudding and a Mocha Martini. Pudding aficionados of the world, look no further. This is the one. Dark brown butter overtones, rich caramel flavour, and yet still light and spongy, this is a dessert lovers dream come True. I devoured it like I hadn't eaten in days.  The service was interesting. The server only delivered our bar orders, the rest was brought by food runners. The restaurant seemed a little short staffed but they managed to still be very attentive. I never got to have my martini, but the server apologised profusely (was not a problem) and she took it off the bill. I will definitely come here again and take advantage of the happy hour prices!",

There was a woman walking around and filling waters and clearing plates and she was very friendly. The food was disappointing. I feel bad rating poorly but I think Gordon would want honest reviews. The chicken was dry and had little flavor. Portions are pretty small and that can be typically of a higher priced restaurant so I wasn't annoyed by that..except the food wasn't high quality. I honestly feel like I could have better at a chain restaurant then here. Gordon, pop into this place unexpectedly. Maybe have someone else do it so they don't recognize you and try harder on your meal.",

I've had the Ribeye, wagyu, butter chicken, pork chop, beef pot pie, and finally the hellfire wings. The hellfire wings are some of the best wings I've ever had. They are the perfect balance of heat and flavor. The toffee dessert is awesome also. When we eat there I bring my two daughters, 4 years old and 8 months, the servers go out of their way to make my daughter chocolate milk by \"borrowing\" from the bar. GREAT service every time. I will always recommend this restaurant to friends and family. As most people that live in Vegas I don't frequent the \"strip\" but I make an exception for this great restaurant! One last thing save room for the sticky toffee pudding. It's mine and my daughters favorite dessert!",

My wife had the Steak Ale pie and she loved it. I tasted it and thought it was very good as well. My one complaint is value. Pretty pricey place, but not too out of the norm for Vegas. My wife and one beer for $12. Two lunches, plus the beer came to $85 with tip. Same lunch anywhere but Vegas or NYC would probably be $50 tops.",

When we were first brought out our food, we informed them of this, but rather than fixing their mistake, they brought out the same steak and insisted that this is what we ordered....  Ribeye: fine, cooked perfectly to medium rare Calamari: soggy and way too salty Brussel sprouts: over cooked and soggy Shepherds pie: good  Overall, the service was OK and the food was average and way overpriced.

The dill tarter sauce was so good I had to ask for more. The Cod was batter fried to perfection. The deserts were incredible.

All entrees were praised, although the Fish and chips were a bit too salty for one of us. The rack of lamb was the best I have ever tasted. I also really loved the Ramsay tonic cocktail, and am still searching the internet for a recipe for it.  The cocktail was exactly what I expected from Gordon - imaginative, a bit innovative, and delicious.

Our drinks were fantastic! I had the Ramsay Tonic & my date had the Innis & Gunn draft. We ordered up the Truffle Chips & Deviled Eggs much to our delight, as everything was better than anticipated. So much so, that we downed our appetizers & declared a round trip after seeing Elton John perform.   Upon our return for additional drinks, we had the opportunity to meet & thank Chef Ramsay for a great experience.   Saving the best for last... I will say that our bartender, Brandon, was beyond friendly, insightful, attentive, and gracious. He truly made time to make us feel welcome despite how busy he was. He provided drink and food suggestions, & also pointed us in the right direction for a fun filled night of gambling.    I'd give five stars; however, given our limited time to dine, I'll leave that for our next visit where we try more of the menu!!",

We read menu.... pork, veal, lamb, pork, pork ... duck. No burger. Waiter 2 comes by and we ask about burger and part of lunch menu. We can order but will take 30 minutes or more to get them since prep staff not present. 2 of 4 of us order burgers, 1 gets hanger steak and 1 gets fish and chips. We have empty drinks and not asked about refills. Ordered drinks with waiter 1 and drinks no show. Order drinks with waiter 2 and get 10 minutes later. When waiter 2 returns with the burgers but no hanger steak or fish and chips. Then drinks arrive from waiter 2, as we watched our drinks from waiter 1 sit on the bar for 30 minutes. Waiter 1 starts to deliver our drinks 5 minutes later and does an about face before arriving at our table when he sees the drinks on the table. But no one asks the other guys in our party if they want refills. I started this review on my Smart Phone which I had for a week and wasn't used to typing on it and now I am finishing it up a month and half later. But the upshot was it was one of the most unusual and memorable (not in a good way) dining experiences I ever had. I thought of filling out a card for management as I left, but I couldn't find one. I asked the hostess and she looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas together for the first time, this was also our first vacation together and we have been together going on 10 years. The one and only place I really wanted to go to was Gordon's Pub and Grill. We drove straight through the night from the Seattle area to be able to get there with enough time to enjoy all of the sights. Let me tell you that this was by far the biggest disappointment. I have watched EVERY show this man has EVER done and I am the biggest fan, all I wanted to do was taste his food. I ordered an 8oz steak medium rare and it was supposed to come with potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Well I got my steak and vegetables(no potatoes) my steak was rare and cold so I had to hunt down our waiter to put it back on the grill for a bit longer. He was very rude and said that I should have ordered it medium...uh no you should have just cooked it medium rare like I asked and delivered it warm not cold. When I did get it back I still had no potatoes but the steak was perfect. My waiter never did return, instead a runner named Chris brought my food out and was very nice. He even checked back with me to make sure it was good. Throughout the meal we had obviously drank all of our drinks but still no waiter. We ended up calling the manager over and he was gracious enough to comp my boyfriends meal. This only happened because he had only eaten a few bites because his burger was also under done but he didn't want to create even more of a scene than I had. All in all I would say that I wouldn't eat at this pub again do to the rudest service I had ever experienced(keep in mind that I eat in Seattle usually so I am used to larger cities and the fact that they get busy) At the end of our meal I finally found our waiter at a table filled with all women, I guess flirting was more of a priority.  I wish I had a better experience this will most likely be the last vacation I get in a long time.",

Had pub shots (mini hamburgers) for appetizer, grilled asparagus for side dish (grilled well) and filet mixed grill.  The mixed grill wasn't worth the price.  Needed a touch of salt, but for the prices charged, shouldn't need anything.  Though I'll admit the sauces were good.    Love the pub crawl.  Not much of a bourbon fan, but the pub crawl could change that.  Excellent drinks.  Overall a disappointment.  Over priced food, but drinks and service exceptional.  Not a total loss, but definitely room for improvement.  Just need to tweek seasoning.",

I ordered the  shepherd's pie.  Flavorful, but so dry.  It needed some kind of sauce. My wife ordered the lamb burger.  It was so dry, she dipped it in her ketsup. Side of fries were so hard, had to use knife to cut them. We made this a destination restaurant, and it was bitterly disappointing. Will not try again. Gordon you're building an empire, but it's all in about the quality, and our recent experience at your Pub questions how much you are involved.",

I would have rated it a 3.5 star but that is not an option. Its a very nice restaurant and my waiter was pretty good. I had the chicken wings which were nothing special in the end but you can only do so much with a chicken wing. For my entree I had the fish n chips. This comes with two pieces of well battered Cod and steak cut fries. The fish was very good and met my expectations. The fries overall were just fries. They did have a unique horse radish ketchup which was pretty good. I would return for the fish but not much else. I felt there was something missing but overall it is a little pricey but worth a go.",

Thought the server (who seemed overwhelmed,and not very attentive.. would have a fit when my dining partner asked for salt.) Service needs some service. The food tasted like nothing. No flavor...The place has great atmosphere,and that's about it. I don't know why Gordon Ramsay is so bitchy on the TV show about flavor and texture of food...he needs to pay attention to his own cooking....never should have wasted 175.00 on dinner for two here. Should have gone to Trevi .",

Multiple waiters passed us and could see we were just sitting there with no food or drink...like they were saying to themselves \"That's not my table.\"  Other than that, once we got a waiter, he was pretty good, and the food was great.  Try the shrimp salad...very fresh!  I would go back only if I walked by and it was't crowded.  FYI - this is the 4th Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been (all 3 in Vegas and 1 in NY).  The food has always been great...anyone saying otherwise probably has no taste!",

We changed tables as many times as the color wheel from twister. The waitress gave us her recommendations and the lamb burger was to die for. The first bite I took was filled with creamy savory feta and carmalized onions that just make u think of being on vacation and remembering the first step u took out of the plane watching the sun set in the horizon. Yes it was like an oasis in my mouth accompanied by a savory but lean and juicy lamb patty that was perfectly spiced. The lamb was so delicious I had to buy the chef a shot of patron. Kudos chef ramsey. I was so stuffed that I couldn't make room for dessert. So I excused myself from the table and threw up in the restroom so i could have some of their world famous bread pudding.  I cant even begin to describe the bread pudding. Its consistency was more like a cake that crumbled as it touch my lips. The ice cream was light and whipped with crunchy peanut brittle that made me pause from reading shades of gray. Yes it was that good.  Chef ramsey left my loins on fire. Kudos!!!!",

    "text": "This is a disappointment. I have always been a lover of all things GR and have made an effort to frequent all his best establishments.   Came here to just get a quick bite between other meals. Upon showing up, plenty of empty seats available but the Hostess just pointed us to the bar. No worries, I didn't really need a table but at least being led in would have been nice. Went into the \"bar area\" that I was pointed to and sat down at table there. Had several servers walk by with no acknowledgement. eventually, as I was about to get actually pissed off, a server came by and told me the table was \"reserved\" and we would have to sit at the bar. Again, no effort to actually assist or direct or give any sort of service, just really poor form.   By the way, while I was sitting at the \"reserved\" table waiting for service, I had a chance to notice how poorly kept things were. There were dirty tables everywhere. It just seemed as there was a lot of staff walking around and no one actually caring for things. With the amount of staff they had here this place should have been spotless. So not only was the service completely lacking but it was a mess to look at.  We moved ourselves over to the actual bar and were greeted by a friendly enough bartender, (he is one of two things keeping this rating from being a 1). He took our order and poured up some drinks. The weird thing is that I had a Stella Artois, and it had absolutely no head at all, I assume that either the line was dirty or there was some film in the glass that prevented a head. They rinse their glasses so it almost has to be a dirty line.  We only ordered a couple of items, Scotch egg and deviled eggs. Both were really good for sure, (there is the other thing that kept this a 2 star instead of 1).   The other thing about this place - it just looks confused as hell. If I were to go all Asian on you I would say there is absolutely no Feng Shui. It just seems like there was an argument between the chef, the hotel, the backers, and the bank and they ALL got their way. It just does not flow and for shits sake GET RID OF ALL THE RIDICULOUS KEGS ON THE WALL!! They are not trendy, it is not visually pleasing. It is just super heavy and distracting.   Anyway.....To Gordon, or the GM - PLEASE get on your front of house and have them learn a bit about service and upkeep for this place. There is just no way that it should have been this rough when it was not even remotely busy.",

I made reservations for Hell's Kitchen and the food was top notch. We had the best customer service and the food was amazing . I would highly recommend Hell's Kitchen. The next day myself and 12 of my family members made reservations at the Gordon Ramsey Pub in Cesar's Palace. I ordered the fish and chips along with a side of the Lobster Mac and cheese. Well I will tell you if Gordon Ramsey took a taste of this lobster Mac and cheese he would have fired the chef on the spot. This was the most dry no flavor Mac and cheese I've ever eaten in my life. It was like someone used a box of Kraft Mac and cheese from a super market.  I received only a tiny piece of lobster in the entire dish. We had the Lobster Mac and cheese at Hell's Kitchen and it was amazing. I personally feel that Gordon Ramsey should pay a visit to the Pub and it's chefs.   Thank you Mario",

    "text": "I rarely do reviews but I was compelled to do so for Ramsay's Pub and Grill. Let me start my review by telling you that I am a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fanboy. He's a legend in my eyes and I couldn't wait to try this place (We did not get tables at Hell's Kitchen or the Burger place unfortunately). I do realize this is a pub and grill and not a fine dining restaurant but its still Gordon Ramsay dishes and his recipes.  Appetizers - We got the truffle fries, deviled eggs, pigs in a blanket and the poutine. Truffle fries were great, no complaints there. They literally gave us 4 pieces of deviled eggs though. We were a party of 4, so that was 1 tiny piece for each of us. They did taste good though. Pigs in a blanket - We got 3 pieces, literally 3 small pigs wrapped in pastry puffs for 4 of us. Alright, I can get with the portions but they were just about meh-okay. Hardly any flavor to them. The poutine - I was SO excited to try the poutine here. There were literally 3 small tiny puddles of cheese curds for the entire dish. The beef was good but the gravy was SALTY, VERY salty. Almost overpowered the whole thing.   Entrees - We got the beef wellington, butter chicken curry, fish and chips and a burger. Of all the entree's, the beef wellington was OK. I mean its almost 60$ for an order, the meat was cooked well but was not seasoned at all, very bland. The fish and chips were actually really good, no complaints there. the burger was again, under-seasoned, whatever little taste we got was from the sauces and cheese. And now the butter chicken curry - oh bloody hell (circa 2017, Gordon Ramsay).   The butter chicken deserves an entire paragraph. Firstly, its not butter chicken at all. Its pieces of chicken in some sort of curry sauce with honestly tasted store bought. I am not accusing anyone of anything here but I have Indian roots, I know what butter chicken should taste like, this isn't it. Not even close. The curry was salty with the slightest hint of spice but that's about all one can taste in it. It was really bad. The rice that comes with it - oh bloody hell - it was literally just cooked in saffron spice, nothing else. It had no salt, no other spices, just the flavor of saffron. If you know saffron, you should know that its a very expensive spice and it's supposed to be used in minimal quantities and enhance the flavor of your dish, its not supposed to the only flavor coming through. The rice was overpowered with saffron and that's the ONLY thing I could taste, incredibly disappointing. The naan (bread) was actually really good, soft and warm and the way it was supposed to be.   Drinks - We got some beers, wine and a mule. The moscow mule was served in a tall glass rather than the traditional copper mug but the drink itself was nothing to write home about. Just a mediocre moscow mule.  We ended up paying around 350$ for the whole meal. While we all knew coming in that it was going to be expensive, we expected WAAY more from the food and we felt cheated walking out.   :'(",

We ordered the steak and mushroom pie, lobster rolls, pesto and garlic Mac and cheese, and the salmon bruschetta. I was expecting the portions to be on the smaller side and boy did they look small lol. It was a good thing I ordered a bunch of food, but surprisingly we both got full from our meal and even had some left over! The pie reminded me of a pot roast with big chunks of steak and mushroom. My favorite component was the crust on top and I wish they gave me more of it! The lobster rolls were also good and it was really fresh. The pesto Mac was my favorite since I love pesto while my brother (and the waitress) preferred the garlic Mac. The salmon bruschetta reminded me of the bologna lunchables for some reason haha. It wasn't bad, but not something I would order again.  I will definitely be coming back to this place to try out some of their other items. As expected the place is a bit pricey, but you're paying for the name and atmosphere lol. Our lunch was about $70. Would recommend this place if you haven't been here yet!",

    "text": "Pro Tip: Don't forget to check in on Yelp at this place for your free Sticky Toffee Pudding!   Staying in Vegas, it is necessary to try a famous chef's restaurant and this was the perfect Vegas meal. We were staying at Caesars and were not wanting to travel far and this was perfect for our casual attire. We were in comfortable booth that was great for lounging and drinking.  The little details from the union jack logo, wooden menu, keg wall, and many other things really made this place great.  Starting Vegas off with a Boddington Pub Ale that Ramsay has on tap. This is one of the smoothest beers I've had in a can and having it on tap was delicious!  We started by ordering the scotch eggs and soft pretzel sticks(may be under a different name) that were inhaled so fast I was unable to get a picture. The scotch eggs are breaded soft boiled eggs with sausage with a mustard cream sauce. These were perfect for the table.  The pretzel rods come with a spicy mustard and a cheese sauce that you will want to lick clean.  I ordered the Sheperd's Pie which is one of my all time favorite dishes. The beef in this dish seemed to be inconsistently seasoned but the areas that were tasted amazing. It also comes with a small kale salad and pretzel rod.  My boyfriend ordered the Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich that comes with homemade chips. I am not a fan of corned beef but this tasted good to me. Its not a traditional Texas brisket like what were used to back home which caused some confusion but it was devoured.  My cousin ordered the fish and chips and I have to say this was the best item of the table. The fish was light and with the malt vinegar it was incredible. The \"chips\"/fries that came with it were slowly being stolen from him plate as these tasted incredible also. The only thing that was odd was the peas that were served had mint in them which may be an authentic British thing but was not my favorite.  Now the best part was as being a part of the Yelp family, when you check into this restaurant, you get a coupon for a free Sticky Toffee Pudding. It is served with a cookie butter ice cream. This is RICH but I think one of the top sticky toffee puddings I have had. This was split between 5 at the table and everyone had a hefty portion. This is the perfect place to grab a beer, great food, and sticky toffee pudding! Highly Recommend.",

Besides the wonderful food (try the hanger steak!), the service is top notch! Even though it's in the middle of a casino and can get crowded, the staff is what one would expect when eating at such a famous chef's restaurant. The waitress knew the menu, made wonderful recommendations, and catered to our every need. We started off with the Butternut Squash soup with herb butter (rich!), after I ordered the Traditional Shepard's Pie, made with beef and lamb. It's wonderful topping of whipped mashed potatoes browned to perfection is to die for! My husband ordered the hanger steak, and he offered me a few bites. So tender! Finally, we devoured the sticky, toffee pudding! I can't say enough about our waitress, or the table attendant. So friendly and always asking if we needed anything, and when dinner was served, she came straight by to make sure we were happy!  Awesome job!!  I nearly nicked Ramsay a star for a lady walking around taking souvenir pictures. She had a rattling loud gab fest at the table next to us in a restaurant that has to modify noise levels anyways. She stayed too long chatting it up at this table.  I don't think we need souvenir photographers in a world with Iphones. There was also a very large pool of water in the hallway in the kitchen area that I could see from the restrooms, and it was alarming they'd allow that to be tracked around. My paper menu was soiled as well.  Other than that, we'll be back!",

We had eaten at Gordon Ramsay Steak earlier in the week, and decided to give the Pub and Grill a try. We are so glad we did. I have recently moved back to the US from several years in the UK. I was homesick for great fish and chips. I ended up being swayed by the promise of fresh Scottish Salmon and OMG was it amazing! I nearly wept. I have missed great salmon. Scott H. our waiter was absolute perfection. He described each dish, and seemed to intuitively know which dishes we would each like. He was spot on.My daughter had the fish and chips  -perfect flaky white fish in light batter with homemade tarter sauce and my sister had the steak pie with a rich gravy and flaky light crust.  He took pictures of our group, he approached Chef Christina from Hell's Kitchen for us to ask permission for a picture (which we got and it was DAY MADE lol),  recommended delicious cocktails, and in general made our experience as close to perfect as possible.  We have been Ramsay fans for years. After dining in three other Ramsay restaurants in England,  I honestly thought the Vegas restaurants would be a let down with disappointing food. I was wrong.The food was worth every penny, although I thought the prices extremely reasonable especially in light on the high quality.  Ramsay deserves many kudos for the great staff he employs. These are people who obviously love their jobs and are masters at them. It was a terrific experience and one we will not soon forget!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place.  Maybe after having dinner at the London restaurant in West Hollywood, I expected more from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  We arrived a bit early to our reservation and the hostess treated us as if we had just slapped her mother.  When I sheepishly asked if we could get a drink at the bar while we waited, she flippantly said we could but that she wouldn't be assisting us with a table until our reservation time.    So we got a drink.  2 Vodka Red Bulls, 1 Black & Tan, 1 Heineken and 1 Iced Tea...for $60?!?  Regardless, I realized we were going to a well named chef's restaurant and I tend to be prepared for inflation...but that was a rough way to start out.  Once it was time for our reservation, I went back to the hostess booth and was pleasantly surprised to find someone new.  Fortunately for us, this new girl didn't hate life in the same way and was kind enough to sit our group.  3 of our group ordered the Fish & Chips.  1 ordered the scallops and I, in an attempt to try as much as I could, ordered the Filet mixed grill.  As a starter, I ordered the corn soup and my wife the heirloom tomato salad.  The Starters...incredible.  My soup was fantastic and the tomato salad even better.  We loved the pretzel bread the brought out and all were very excited for our main courses.  Main courses...mine sucked...well I should say...the fish & chips DIDN'T suck.  My friend's scallops were good, but they were sitting in a bowl of broth.  There really wasn't much to the dish....except a $32 price tag.  Then came my mixed grill.  The shrimp were WAY over cooked.  Rubber Shrimp.  The Steak was cooked nicely and the Pork Belly had great flavor, but under all 3 items was a sauce...all of which were horrible.  The shrimp had a white puree that was completely pointless.  Under the pork belly was a horrible pea green baby food that didn't taste like much but made the food unappetizing.  Lastly under the filet was a poor rendition of a tomato based barbecue type sauce.  On top of it all, when I ordered my meal the server asked \"Ok and what side would you like\"  which I assumed meant that I was supposed to choose.  I asked him his recommendation and ordered the asparagus.  Not only were they completely boiled and tasteless...they were only there to add $10 (Yes TEN DOLLARS for boiled asparagus.) Brutal.  All in all, I struggle to not give it 1 star, but the fish & chips were good and the appetizers were nice...so I'll give it 2.  Regardless of how many stars, we will not return to this restaurant.",

They were just ok, way over priced. I would have thought for somewhere around $12.00 we would have gotten more than two boiled eggs ( 4 halves) the taste wasn't anything special.  My husband had the fish and chips, he liked the fish fairly well but some of the chips/fries were way under cooked. He couldn't even eat all of them due to the fact that the potato was hard in the middle.  I had the chicken chopped salad. The dressing was flavorless, the flavors all blended together, (what little flavor there was) I wasn't even certain that there was chicken in the salad until I was able to finally spot  it, once I tasted it, I realized that it wasn't worth looking for. There were large chunks of hard lettuce mixed into the salad that was fairly bitter.  All in all, I'm glad I went so I can say that I went to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, but I do not plan on making a return trip, to this location or any other of his brands.

The fish was like butter and delicious but the shepherds pie was DIVINE. We also had two cocktails that were so tasty they didn't last long. The staff extremely helpful. Would highly recommend this to anyone who is keen to try some famous Ramsey food. The bill didn't break the bank either.",

The filet was terrible, poor grade, at the price should cut with a butter knife.  Asparagus was woody, mashed was good as well as the salad.  No rolls, they serve no rolls.  The toffee dessert was excellent, should have just had that.  Mostly upset with the filet, fine quality you should be able to cut with a butter knife and not chewy.  Wonder if the steakhouse has the same quality.",

    "text": "Ok, allow me to begin by saying that the food here is quite satisfying. Our server was willing to accommodate any special request and did so, with a smile. Our party enjoyed our time and our food. Upon leaving I realized that I could not find my sunglasses. I immediately called and let the restaurant know. Unfortunately the 3 females located at the host stand were not very helpful. I believe the exact words were \"no one has turned anything in, you can check with security later. That's where we will turn everything in\" um... Ok? I literally JUST left ... One of those girls can't walk 10steps and take a quick look around the table and possibly the women's restroom??? You have to be kidding me. I understand that the conversation of what they did their past weekend is fascinating but, you just had a guest call about a missing item. This missing item can be easily tracked since I left less than 15 minutes ago. Nonetheless, it seemed hopeless so I turned around and headed back to the restaurant. A very kind gentleman in a suit (probably the manager) offered to assist. He walked to the back of the room and came back in less than sixty seconds with my sunglasses in hand! Thank you kind sir for being the hero. I know hostesses usually don't have the best reputation... But these three had the opportunity to change that tonight. Sorry ladies... Epic fail. Thank goodness there was someone else willing to step in. It may not be important to you, but if it's important to your guest... It should be important to you. This place would have received 5 stars otherwise.",

Those were some of the best cocktails I've had all week! The nachos were super yummy, the Mac and cheese was on point and so were the sandwiches we got. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, and because this is GR's pub I expected pub food- not Michelin stars, and I was delighted to have a delicious version of just that.",

Not exceptional given the hype of this restaurant but good. Mine however was aweful and inedible. I ordered the half lobster which was so overcooked it was RUBBER!

Not so at the Pub. I could have used a steak knife. It did not appear to be very fresh. Rather dried out. If you watch Gordon Ramsay's Hells kitchen on TV, you know he insists upon properly seasoned food. With today's lamb shank, I had to ask for salt as it definitely lacked  seasoning.  On the positive side, after the manager asked me how I liked the lamb, he was gracious enough to cut my bill in half.   I am not giving up on Gordon Ramsay. Tomorrow evening I am going to try his steakhouse at Paris hotel in Las Vegas.",

As for the food, my hubby and I had a few things there. As we weren't that hungry we only had a salad (forgot which one) the 3 pies combo and a spotted dick. We were sharing everything.   The salad was just a big waste of time, had some good elements but not worth the money or the time to chew it .   As for the pies, now that's where the magic is. the combo is 3 pies, chicken lamb and the famous shepherd pie. Each one was absolutely great but the Shepherd pie definitely blew the others out of the way. So flaky, and warm, it was just perfect. So if you do try the place just trust me and order the Shepherd pie and you'll be like a happy little kid.   As for the spotted dick, AKA bread pudding, it's absolutely and utterly amazing. Perfection on a plate. Don't you dare leaving the pub without trying it. It is just great!",

As always, Drew picked better and had the bangers and mash.  Three different sausages made of different meats with one of the best gravies I've ever had!

The look and feel of the place is a hip, upscale pub.  There is a a big bar, tons of tables and then some booths too.  It is a really big space and it is lined with lots of big TVs if you want to watch a game (they had soccer on while we were there).  All the waitresses are in newsprint and safety pin dresses and the waiters are in skinny black jeans and spiked suspenders.  It is modern hip punk....whatever!  I liked it all, it worked.    We basically ordered burgers and beer.  Their drinks menu is on an ipad that they bring over and let you flip through so you can see pretty pictures of whatever you want to order.  Drinks are Vegas prices (so high).  Our Sam Adams was like $9.  The burgers came out and they were thick and well cooked.  The fries that come with it, as many have commented, are different.  They are a very, very think cut steak fry.  It is almost like they quarter a potato and deep fry it (to give you a visual on how thick they were).  I loved both my burger and my fries.  The burger had great flavor & it was juicy. The fries were fully cooked and had a bit of crust, but were a little more mushy in the middle.  They had a great flavor though and I loved the different take on a classic.    Our server was terrific and he let us linger.  It was a good experience.  It was Vegas pricey, but we were in the resort so you just kind of expect that!",

The three of them were constantly making sure everyone had drinks and that the food was replenished accordingly. With the pre-set group menu we had the sliders, nachos, fire wings, pigs in a blanket and shrimp. Everyone loved the food, I heard various comments that it was all excellent.

    "text": "I didn't enjoy much of the food here. This place is huge, and quite empty. Regardless, we sat down because I love Ramsay.   Maybe because I'm not a burger fan to start with, but the lamb burger our waitress recommended to me was very lamby(heavy lamb smell) with a bunch of blue cheese which was making the whole burger even heavier.   The crab cake(?) I forgot the original name, but this crab thing was simply imitation crab in an oily bun... Disappointed   Also,we ordered the deviled eggs since I saw reviews on yelp: the taste was quite blunt. Nothing special and I don't really recommend.   The only highlight was the fries and sticky tofu pudding.   I would stay away from this place if you are a Ramsay fan, and go to the Ramsay steak house.",

They came to our table cold. Pretzel bread is not good cold. Three short unsalted sticks $10. Skip it. The dip lacked flavor.  The waiter was rude and put down our drink choice.  The Reuben was dry had maybe one tablespoon of kraut on it and less cheese. The waiter was really put off when I asked for cheese for it. Then he brings some poor slices of not even the same cheese that was on it.  He didn't tell us the options for the entrees. When I asked for a replacement of the cardboard tasting chips he told me \"no\" and just I ship do have asked up front.",

    "text": "Had zero plans to eat lunch here while out shopping inside Caesar's Palace.  But whatever it was that led me here - hunger, tired feet, FATE - I'm so glad it did.  This was hands-down my favorite lunch out of all the places we tried on vacation.  First of all, I loved the decor of the restuarant.  You really felt this is what a real English pub would look like.  It could be an Americanized version for all I know, but I still liked it.  Our service was great.  Very friendly wait staff.  There were water spots on my husband's fork, which isn't even that big of a deal, but our waiter noticed it (without us pointing it out first) and replaced it right away.  I thought that was a very nice, above-and-beyond touch.  I started off with a very delicious cocktail called Goodbye Blue Sky, which was blueberry vodka, Chambord, sparkling wine and fresh lemon and blueberries.  So refreshing.  I hardly ever finish my cocktail at any place I go, but this one could have easily begat a second one as much as I loved it.  We decided to pass on appetizers as we didn't really want to stuff ourselves for lunch (knowing we had a very large dinner ahead of us later).  I debated on what to order because so many things sounded delicious.  Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, even considered ordering several apps as my entree (Scotch Egg - yum!).  Finally decided to go classic English pub and ordered the Fish and Chips.  This was without a doubt the best fish and chips I've ever eaten.  Three lovely pieces of beautifully battered white fish - the texture was spot on (crispy and light), fish cooked to perfection.  Served with a side of mushy peas, which were also very tasty.  They were minty, although I didn't taste too much of it.  If I could complain about anything, I'd say the fries were nothing special.  The weren't horrible by any means, but for $30 you may expect something hand-cut at the very least.  Everytime we see a Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert, we have to try it.  For something not chocolately, this bread pudding is surprisingly good.  Warm, with a rich caramelly drizzle atop a delicious sweet cream ice cream.  It's like a comfort dessert - you leave feeling wrapped in a warm blanket, cozy and comfy.  Perfect ending to a fantastic meal.  The only thing I wasn't keen on was the price of the food.  Now, I can eat expensive food, and have no problem paying for it.  But let's be honest - this was not an upscale 5-star restaurant.  It's a pub with above average food.  It's not overly gourmet or made with luxury ingredients.  I'd say you're paying for the Gordon Ramsey name for the most part.  Don't get me wrong cuz the food was spectacular, but it could definitely handle being slightly cheaper.  Lunch food shouldn't cost over $100 for two people.",

Their charcuterie appetizer was so lacking in flavor and their pates were hard as a rock.  So disappointed. One only highlight of the meal was the pretzels with very spicy mustard.   The fish n chips were ok (better be for $27) and their chicken curry (wish this was better explained by the waiter) wasn't what I had expected.   For a pub too, what a standard and boring beer draft menu. At least bring in Fullers! Sheesh.   Skip this place and head to Central, Caesars 24 hr restaurant, located in the lobby.",

    "text": "Very disappointed.  This rating is based on an overall experience.    My son who is 12 years old is a huge Gordon Ramsey fan.  So we decided to eat at one of Ramsey's restaurants and we were deeply disappointed.   The food here was okay.  My son appreciates food and loves to cook. He ordered the short ribs. My husband ordered the recommended fish and chips.  For the price it was descent but  would never order again.  Please see attached picture.  2 pieces of fish. You would think the presentation would be better at a Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  My other son and myself ordered the burger.  bland bland bland..  nothing special.   My son said the short ribs were okay ..  he has had better.    We do not mind spending the money when it is a great or even a good dining experience and tasty food.  This was disappointing not only for the parents but for my sons!! We spent approximately $150.00 on lunch and we were still hungry.   We didn't order the desert. I was afraid it would be horrible.   A tip for the restaurant - you need to assign less tables to a waitress or put more staff.  For a restaurant like Gordon Ramsey's we expect that waters are to be immediately refilled and the waitress to check up on a table not only when he/she  takes the order but throughout the experience.  I had to flag her down to ask for more ketchup and tarter sauce. A customer doesn't need to flag a waitress down.   Although we still left a tip because my husband is generous, I wanted to leave zero.    Unfortunately, we won't be back- not sure if we will eat at another Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  Disappointing that's all I can say.",

In Addition to that Anise was an excellent server with a lot of attention to detail. Overall I thought that the quality of food for the price was an excellent value.  HOT TIP: this place does get pretty crowded so I highly recommend booking the reservation using OpenTable. When you arrive even if there's a line go right up to the front and ask the hostess to check you in which she will do it right away.",

    "text": "Ok we came back first time since 2013. It's really not conducive to locals visiting restaurants on the strip as we now pay for parking (we did valet) and still seems strip restaurants don't care about locals business.   We went early on 12/21/16 at 530pm were sat right away and waiter came over with a bottle of water to fill out glasses.   I have never seen a bottle just explode and come apart like this one did, I had water all over my leg and shirt and the table was flooded. Luckily the waiter did not get sliced.   We were moved to another table as the floor was also soaked. Waiter apologized about five times and so did the lady assisting him. We saw them talking to the manager as well after.   Food was very good we both had the Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries with one drink each. Service was spot on throughout and food was a solid four.   What is amazing is the manager never bothered to come over and you would think one drink would be comped but nothing at all. Absolutely no customer service from the manager. I had cold water all over me and granted it was just water but we had to move tables and nothing was done by the manager.   Honestly there is no reason to drive and pay for parking to get better service closer to home by places that want locals business.   Gordon Ramsey really needs to get better management here, we had issues the first time we came and it seems management is the weak part of this operation.   Food and waiter were very good so if you are close it's worth it but it's really not worth driving as a local when our business is not appreciated by management.   Updated review from April 1 2017  Absolutely fantastic experience all around. We were seated promptly at our reservation and the food and service were terrific. I forgot our waitresses name but she was one of the best we have ever had anywhere. She made a terrific beer recommendation as well as the Prime rib special which was perfect. My wife had the Hells Kitchen burger and it is great. It is obvious management is trying very hard to get things right and it shows. We will be back again soon. We could find no fault with anything and you have to have the sticky toffee pudding for dessert trust me on this.   I can honestly say this was one of the few Strip restaurants that made locals feel welcome. As I said it is obvious that management is working really hard and the issues we had in the past have been fixed.",

    "text": "Got the fish and chips. Half great half blah.   Make a reservation. Place gets busy quickly.   It has an awesome pub feel. Great service!  They recommended the fish and chips. Waitress said it was the most popular dish. They apparently make 2-300 of them daily.   The fish was great. Not oily at all. Had a nice taste as well.   The chips that accompanied the fish were terrible. Soft, soggy and tasteless.  We had a few and left the rest. Waitress never asked us how we felt about them. Clearly they sucked lol  This was my second favorite of the Gordan Ramsay restaurants in Vegas. BurGR was awesome.   Also, side note. We were watching the GSW OKC game 6 playoff game. The place for loud and lively. Nice atmosphere. Nothing like back home but nothing really is. #wethenorth",

The food was amazing, started with the Lobster Roll which just melted in your mouth ... truly tasty! ... then had the lamb burger and truffle fries which was matched (by our amazing server Jenny) with a very delicious Pinot Noir.   Wish we had room for dessert because the dessert menu looked incredibly delicious!!  The pub is uniquely decorated and cozy at the same time .... especially loved the Corgi chairs and the British Flag drink & food menus.   What brought it to 5 stars though was our simply awesome server Jenny. She was very attentive, answered all questions, had a great sense of humor & smile :) She was busy and dealt with some not so nice customers but never stopped smiling or keeping up with her nice customers :)  Highly recommend .... and ask for Jenny! :)",

We decided to get food while we waited. There was no line and the hostess was very welcoming to us. We were seated quickly and had a drink in hand in no time- awesome!  We got the calamari, nachos, and fish and chips to share. All of it was awesome but I have to say, that may have been the best fish and chips I've had in YEARS. We all wish we would have ordered another plate. The calamari was cooked perfectly and the portion was huge. Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!",

You couldn't ask for a group of nicer and accommodating staff.  The food is on point!  I definitely recommend the Lobster Mac N Cheese.  It is so decadent and tasty it will send you into a food coma, but also soaks up all the alcohol.  Everything we ate was carbalicious and amazing!!!!  Chef Ramsay should be very proud of this outlet because everyone from front of house to back of house is friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.  Highly recommend this place for pre or post show at the colosseum, or just for a great night out!",

Waitress was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu (coincidentally she LOVED all the expensive stuff on the menu, I guess it is Vegas...).  Aside from the weird, tight, newspaper looking dresses that Gordon frocked them in, the waitstaff seemed on the ball as a whole.    Not sure what was going on in the kitchen though, it took a bit over an hour for our food.  If you haven't seen the menu its a trendy gastropub fare with flashes of England throughout.  I got the Lamb T-bone and it was so damn salty my foot swelled almost immediately.  For some reason, all four of our meals seemed a bit salty to me, I guess it is pretty typical english fare but I was a bit disappointed.  The atmosphere was awash with loud english flair accented by the waitstaff's overly loud garb.    Gordon, I just expected more from you.  If you're gonna make a fish and chips joint, be sure to keep it simple and rely on the pure flavor of the food not overseasoning as compensation.",

Took forever to get served (even waters/drinks) after getting a late reservation. Food and drinks came out slow. took over 45 minutes to get our food after ordering. When the food finally came out the sides were not ready and my steak was already cooling down. We called the manager over to complain and while he was there apologizing, the creamed spinach side finally came and was accidentally dumped on one of our party. Needless to say dinner \"was on them\" after that.  The food did not live up to my impression of Gordon Ramsy except in that the kitchen was from hell.  Our waitress tried to be as attentive as possible but this place is a train wreck and I think there are better options around for the money (assuming we had paid)",

The service was disappointing with our waitress forgetting our fries (she didn't write it down) and not seeming too concerned when we told her there was broken glass under our table.

    "text": "I stopped by here last night for an early dinner with my fiance.  We didn't have reservations and that did not seem to be a problem as we were sat immediately.  Our seats ended up being right near the edge of the casino and near the posted menu which was distracting for me.  Since it was a Sunday the tv's all had football games on them with the sound playing loudly over the restaurant speakers.  While i enjoyed that, i wish the volume would have been a bit softer.  The decor of the restaurant itself is quite cool with one room being divided from another with a wall of kegs and then there was some cool chandeliers and a lounge type area.  I also enjoyed the wooden chargers on the table as well as the silverware of which the bottoms reminded me of the St. George cross. What i didn't enjoy was the outfits of the staff as the hounds-tooth was hideous and i would have to agree with other users who said it made them look cheap and trashy.  For an appetizer my fiance and I started out with the duck confit poutine.  Whenever it first came out I was unable to see any of the duck but I eventually found it lurking in the goodness of the poutine.  My favorite parts of it were the duck and cheese although the fries were nice and crispy except for the ones that sat too long in the duck gravy which ended up being overly sweet for me.  Who would have thought that this Canadian dish would end up on a English pub menu.  For my main course I decided on the shepherds pie.  Whenever it came out I thought that it looked a bit small but I was stuffed by the time I had finished it all.  The base was a mixture of beef and lamb combined with some carrots and peas and then topped with some mashed potatoes.  In the end it was a decent dish as the meat was tender but it did not really wow me at all.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably not come back to the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grille in the future.  While my meal was ok, there are too many other places nearby that are better and at the same price point or even cheaper.",

Upon entering the hotel room I immediately noticed a magazine with Gordon Ramsay on the front \"Ramsay takes over Vegas\" Being a HUGE fan, I read it and got giddy when I found out that not only did Pub & Grill open already, but Burgr was planned to open that very night!! (Turns out it opened earlier in the week, but IT WAS OPEN).    We decided to hit Pub and Grill on Saturday night. Josh was our waiter and I swear he had ESP. Every time we mentioned something we needed POOF there he was with it in hand or said...hey could you use...... I jokingly asked him if the bulldog lamp was wired. Josh was simply amazing. I can't say it enough. I would say he gave us the best service out of all the places we ate at this year. He gets brownie points for remembering my name is Darlene, so many people two minutes later forget and call me Diane, Donna...something with a D.   Ok now for the food. I ordered the Shephard's Pie and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger. The Shephard's Pie was good at first. The mashed potatoes were amazing. However, I quickly discovered I didn't care for lamb, my first time ever trying it. I ate about 1/2 of the dish. I soooo wanted to love it, but just couldn't. My boyfriend loved his lamb burger, said it was in his top 10 of burgers. We ordered dessert, I got the sticky toffee pudding and he got the chocoloate trifle. OH MY GOD!!! The sticky toffee pudding was to die for. I could eat that everyday!! The warm sauce topping the cake with a side of frozen cream was just fantastic. I tried my boyfriend's chocolate trifle and it too was incredible. Layers of chocolate with a brownie on the bottom and served with two little chocolate cookies was very cute.   Pub & Grill is not your typical Pub & Grill.......Gordon Ramsay does it again!!",

We returned to our hotel and within three hours he became so violently Ill that he ended up in the ER on IV fluids and medications.  The doctor mentioned it was most likely something he ate, And asked when his last meal was.  Apparently the timing is perfect.  No way to prove it, but I fully believe it was this meal.

I expected phenomenal food from such a tv personality like Gordon Ramsey, what I wasn't expecting was our service! Kimberly was incredible! She was so welcoming and funny! We're from Buffalo, NY and she made us feel at home. She even knew we were called the \"City of Good Neighbors\" and complimented us on how kind we were! We love Kimberly!!!!!! I can't say enough about her and how she is the first person after 4 days of Las Vegas to make us feel so welcomed!",

But they ended up putting tables together so I am happy they could do this.  The food is unbelievably overpriced. That food is not worth the price.  I got to taste a bunch of things from friends.  The food took sooooo long. I was starving. I got a sprite. $4 for a sprite. That is insane.  Then I ordered the Shepard pie. I only got it because it was recommended. I didn't think it was going to just be ground beef and mashed potatoes. That's worth less than 10 dollars and it was $22. Insane!!! It wasn't even that good. It was just okay.  I also tasted the nachos and they were way better than the Shepard pie. Didn't have much cheese but the chips were good at least.  I also tasted one of the burgers and it was the strangest burger I ever had. It wasn't good. It was also $20. None of that was worth it.  I also tasted the cheesecake which was the best thing I had. I loved it but was still overpriced. And I tasted the toffee and it was yummy but not as great as everyone says. I liked the cheesecake a lot better.  Then we had a huge problem with our bill. It took an entire hour so we could get separate bills. Everyone was so upset and just wanted to leave. They kept saying they couldn't split the bills until the manager was called and they finally fixed it. I don't recommend this place at all. Maybe just once to try it but I would never come here again.",

We sat at the bar for a few coctails. Jose was our bartender. Such a nice guy, as well as very professional and knowledgeable. We wound up going back on our 2nd night to watch the Rangers playoff game (the cigarette smoke in sportsbook is too overwhelming for us non-smokers).  On night 2, we met Gene the bartender, who's just as nice as Jose, and also extremely funny. We had great service and entertainment with Jose and Gene, plus the Rangers managed a win.   Food is very good. Between us both, we tried the shepherd's pie, toad in the hole, lamb burger, and tri-tip sandwich. All delicious! Another fun spot we'll definitely return to when we return to Vegas.",

    "text": "Sometimes your reputational for demanding excellence can build an expectation for it. For me, Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill is a solid \"eh\" on the scale.   The food was good. Just good. I had the Shepherd's Pie on a recommendation from the server (he preferred that over the other pies) and though the potato and lamb were well cooked they were under-spiced to the point of flavorlessness. Again, not bad and completely inoffensive, but for 26 bucks my rather small portion left me wishing I'd either picked a different dish or different restaurant.  We also ordered a cheese plate to share. The sharp cheddar and goat cheese were quite good, but the English blue cheese tasted & looked like canned cheese with crumbled blue mixed in. The bread was too hard, and there wasn't enough of it. Eventually we were left eating the cheese alone.   Our server was attentive, polite, and quite personable. No issues there at all.  In the end, this becomes a prohibitively pricey option when you factor in the quality.",

We got a lovely booth at the back of the restaurant.  A waiter came right away to get a drink orders. He was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered fish and chips, and my bf got the lamb burger. Both were delicious.  My only complaint was the price. $30 for fish and chips is a bit excessive, even for a Ramsay restaurant.",

Our order arrived within 5 minutes, which we found to be strange. Our beers hadnt even been served yet. Our waitress came with our drinks and said \"Oh, you're food is here already! That was fast!\" Obviously she thought it was weird too. The shepherds pie was luke warm at best and the routine was cold. It seemed like it was made ahead of time. I mentioned this to our server. She acted weird about it and pretty much left the table. After 10 minutes, she came back and said, you don't seem happy with your poutine, let me get you a new one. But she didn't bring me a new one. She just brought us the check. She didn't charge us for the fries, but I left the restaurant hungry. Also, the shepherds pie came with a tiny bowl of dried kale, dressing on the side. Anyone who has watched Gordon would know that you never serve kale dry and raw like that. Kale needs to be massaged with oil or dressing in order to get that silky texture you expect in a kale salad. So sad and disappointed!",

But it was quite tasty, I was surprised.  I ordered the fish n chips.  That being said I'm not a big fish n chips fan normally because the breading never seems completely done to me.  However the fish n chips was really good.  The batter had just the slightest hint of being not quite crispy all the way through though.  So the 4 stars. But the chips or fries were amazing!!  They are delicious and the size of landscaping timbers!  Someone on here complained about them which I thought was stupid.   It did take about 15 min longer than I thought it should for the kitchen to get our order out though.  We were one of the first ones there and there were several other tables that got their food first.  All in all it was 90 mins start to finish for lunch.",

Love the interior design and the place was packed with a 15 minute wait! We sat at the bar Matt was awesome. Place mats are very English pub looking... Love the plate presentation.  the selection of draft beers is fantastic. they even offer a draft hard apple and pear ciders. the pear was amazing and Matt was happy to let me try a sample of the apple as well.  We started with the duck poutine and the warm pretzels. Pretzels were wonderful and the English mustard was super spicy and delicious. Duck poutine was good but not a lot of confit for the price.  Fish and Chips was a mixed bag. the fish was excellent, cooked perfectly with a great malt vinegar presentation. We did not care for the \"Chips\" the french fries served witht he Poutine were much better.  Sticky toffee pudding an excellent. Peanut butter and Jelly dessert needed work. If I am in the Forum SHops or going to an event/show at Caeser's I will be back.  Lots of great things on the menu I still want to try.  The dual pricing Regular menu price/Harrah's club member pricing truly INSULTING and fit for a Casino buffet not a world class chef",

It took her forever to take my order, and she seemed annoyed to speak to me and have to take a second order for the table.    When the food came out, they completely messed up our entire order.  The waitress hadn't ordered the first people in the party's food, so I got my plate and everyone else was waiting around.  The waitress became somewhat more apologetic at that point, but the speed of the service was terrible.  As for the food, I ordered fish and chips.  The fish was really good but the chips were dry and over-salted.  I thought they had a good beer selection as well which I was happy about.

Me and my friend made reservations MONTHS ago as we watch Hell's Kitchen faithfully, so as soon as we knew we were going to Vegas from Chicago, we knew we had to try out this place with hopes of meeting Executive Chef: Scott Commings, winner of Hell's Kitchen.  Our server Kimberly knew we were extremely excited and she was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu (even though we knew exactly what he wanted because we looked at the menu so many times before going). She was extremely nice and had ties to Chicago. She was the one of the few people in the entire city of Las Vegas who did not have an attitude! lol, but she was spectacular to have around. Also, two members management were extremely attentive throughout dinner service, did not get their names but they were in suits so I can assume it could've been the GM and Assistant GM.   Sidenote: *We were in a rush because we did not want to be late for the concert, we did not tell our server this because we also did not want to rush the experience of being at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. We ordered truffle fries as our appetizer and the 14 oz. Ribeye and the Salmon entree. The food arrived to our surprise so quickly! First the fries, then the entrees, at our table no less than 15-20 minutes cooked to PERFECTION! We both shared everything and was quite full!  Truffle Fries: truffle fries are huge in Chicago and we already knew that we loved them so we definitely wanted to give it a try, the fries were perfectly crispy and the truffle aioli was perfect! I don't usually care for the truffle aioli but this one was delicious!  14 oz Ribeye: Cooked to absolute perfection, our mouths melted, not the steak, our mouths did. That's how delicious this steak was. I've been to plenty of steakhouses before, but when I say that the quality of this beef gave it a flavor like no other paired with perfect seasoning, and seared to perfection. I wanted to cry, that's how good the steak was.  Salmon: With salmon, the trick is getting a crispy skin, a lot of times you get salmon from a restaurant that comes with an unnecessary slimy texture. Not here! I feel like I am repeating myself by saying everything was perfect, but it's been a week since I was here and I have not forgotten about it at all.  I had to tell the manager how amazing the entire experience was and he served us a English Toffee desert that was poured table side and was scrumptious!!!!!   Chef Ramsay, OPEN A RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO! I BEG OF YOU! I personally thank you for this establishment and I 100000% recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas and to anyone who is a fan of Chef Ramsay's monopoly of cooking shows. This was definitely one of the highlights out of Vegas' amazing options and I will never forgot coming here! I couldn't have had a better eating experience!  We even got to meet Scott and take a picture with him!!!  - Devin Torkelsen of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FDevinTorkelsen.com&s=128bb7291cb3838fed134995784358ce92ce3005df63e5beddfaa9b917103a8a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DevinTorkelsen.com</a>",

Several tables of people left before they could be served because they waited so long.  We had hot sticky toffee pudding with ice cream for dessert and it was delivered without a spoon.  We asked for one and waited about 15 mins before we got one, needless to say the ice cream was melted by then.  Seems odd when Gordon is such a stickler for good service.",

I order a lamb burger medium rare and truffle fries to go. 60 minutes later my order comes out. Burger and regular fries and not to go. The guy next to me at the bar ordered a rueben 5 minutes after I ordered and FINISHED it before I recieved my order. And it was wrong. I really wanted to go Gordon Ramsey on them, but I didn't. flavors were there but for 25 bucks it was not a good experience.... or as I think Gordon would say, \"Absolutely F'ing unacceptable!!\"",

Even though there was a reservation, they hobbled together three different sized tables and brought stackable chairs, like the kind from a conference center and we still had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. As if that wasn't enough of a great start, a chair was broken so one of the party members couldn't even lean back and no one rectified it because they were scurrying around sub serving other people. The service was slow AF!!!! The food sat for so long under the heat lamps that the plates were scalding hot, and the bottoms were soaked with liquid from the food and had to be eaten with a knife and fork! The only thing that was quick was them refilling glasses with bottled water ($) for our party of ten. Absolute garbage!!!!",

The bartenders were nothing short of friendly and entertaining. Gene fixed me up a Goodbye Blue Sky (after I gave him the 'I don' t know what I want to drink' look) and managed to charm and be attentive to each person on the back end of the bar.   I started off with the bacon crumble calamari and I was blown away. I love seafood and I think I've had calamari in every restaurant I've ever been in, but this stuff topped it all. I don't even like marinara or tartar sauce, but Bill the manager happened to walk by and encouraged me to try it. It was fresh, didn't taste a thing like the normal bottled sauces I've tried.   The best part is, the food was so rich and good, I could barely finish an appetizer and 2 drinks solo. Between Gene and Bill's attentiveness, the amazing food and the lively atmosphere, I can say the experience was well worth the higher price tag. But what can you expect from a name restaurant? They're a dime a dozen in this town, but this one will stay special to me.",

    "text": "I'm honestly surprised that Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill only has three stars and Gordon Ramsay BurGR has four stars. In my mind it should really be reversed. Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill has nice English pub fare that I would be happy to eat any time.   My friend and I split the steak and ale pie, fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, and truffle fries. All were very pleasing! The steak and ale pie was my favorite - the pie filling was fantastic. I wish I could get my own personal stews to have the same bold yet delicate flavor of steak, mushroom, and ale.   The fish and chips were also satisfying. I am definitely a harsh critic of the batter on the fish (after two years of living in Ireland and eating at my fair share of chippers and pubs) and this one was light and crispy, but still solid. I wish the fish was a bit more seasoned before it was battered, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some malt vinegar.  The lobster mac and cheese was gorgeous. Exactly the ooey-gooey cheesy consistency I look for in mac and cheese - and filled with lots of lobster chunks and flavor. The truffle fries were also fantastic. The truffle aioli had so many chunks of truffle that I was alternating dipping my fries and fish.  My other two friends ordered the lamb burger and the bangers and mash. Both enjoyed their dishes as well.   Again, we had a very good meal at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I would MUCH rather come back here rather than Gordon Ramsay BurGR any day!",

We were a table of 3, two of the appetizer came out while my cousin was still waiting for her French Onion Soup. Apparently, the waiter forgot to take notes so therefore she never got hers. Then after our dinner meal, we ordered desserts. It took another 50 minutes before we get our sticky toffee bun between sipping down our coffee. It was a real long wait. Where's Gordon when you need him to yell at his staff? Totally bad timing. But the waiter was smart and did us a favor by taking out the desserts on the tap on them.   Not so bad, despite the food was super delicious! They probably need to really work on their time management with the kitchen to floor excursion. Otherwise, I definitely wouldn't mind to go back again to try out other dishes! Yippee!!",

The Irish Beef Cheek Stew was uber tender, but surprisingly not the best dish of the meal. It's like a fatty and tender version of pot roast without the benefit of the flavor and texture of carrots or onions (and potatoes if you like that kind of thing). The highlight of the meal just may have been the sticky toffee pudding with sweet cream ice cream. Soft, warm, moist and not overly sweet. Next time I hope to dive into the rest of their pub snacks and small plates.",

When we arrived they said there was a 30 minute wait. Weird. So we waited. Then we were seated and waited somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes to have a Waitress welcome us... even though I complained to the host after 10 minutes. The service was SO bad. The waitress said it was because everyone sat down at the same time because of \"the show.\"  How long has this place bend around? It's called preparation. You know when there's a show.

    "text": "Yeah yeah... so I'm late with a few reviews.. what else is new?   So... we went to dine here over Christmas week.  Jerry Seinfeld had a show we were attending and we just came to this place by chance.  Because we were early enough there was no wait for a table.  And because this is his 3rd restaurant we've been to, we had high expectations, even if it was \"a pub.\"    Starting out, I'd say that the service was chaotic.  No one came to our table after we were sat for a while.  I distinctly remember because I tried to figure out who our server was based on the hustling of servers around us, but not even those servers ever looked at us and said, \"Someone will be right with you, we'll have someone bring over waters, nothing.\" There was NO teamwork at all, just unorganized chaos.   So hubby drank a Boddington's which he can usually get at home for $1.99, and I had a martini.  Drinks were good since we knew what to expect. That is really, the best part of this whole dining experience.  Their menu was lacking at first glance.  Nothing I saw made me wish I could have more than one item...in fact after we'd been sat so long I kind of wish we could of gotten up and gone somewhere else....  But anyway, an English Ale soup and burger later we were at least not starving before the show.  But for counting this as one of our meals in Las Vegas...it was really disappointing.  I'm not giving it one star because the server that did come to us in the end was decent and tried her best.   Would I come back here for any reason?  Oh I think not.  So many places to wine and dine in Las Vegas, are you insane???  In fact... I hear the Oyster Bar calling my name......",

Other people at the table liked them a lot more than me, but I thought they were quite good. The pretzels were good, but far overpriced for a few pieces of bread and mustard. I feel like this should be something every table gets for free. I really wanted to try to duck poutine too, but they were out.  One main reason for giving this 3 stars instead of 4 is that for a pub their beer selection is quite poor. All common bar beers, with just a few common English \"pub\" beers like Boddingtons and Guinness. Nothing exotic. Nothing unique. As a beer lover I was extremely disappointed with their selection. This should be a feature!  I'm not a big fan of the choices in costume for Pub & Grill or Gordon's \"Steak\" place. It all comes off as a bit Vegas and cheesy to me. Dressing the servers and hostesses up in stereotypical \"English\" garb is... it's either shortsighted, or worse, pandering. I can't imagine the people working there enjoy it either.  We all had burgers. Great pate, great buns, great cheese. It was an excellent and simple burger and by far, for me, the highlight. Would like to stop by here again and try some of the other entrees but I'm not sure I could stay away from another burger.",

If you removed all the outer layers (rather like carving the mold off a block of cheese), the inside was pretty good, but WTF? When you're paying $11 for a piece of cheesecake, you deserve better than that. Our server also needs to look for a different line of work. Waiting tables is clearly not his calling.

    "text": "As a Vegas local, let me just say that I didn't have huge expectations given this is one of those celebrity restaurants, but I wanted to see how Gordon Ramsay does pub food, so I took my wife for a weekday lunch to this chaos of a place that Caesars Palace is.    The decor with high ceilings and kegs stacked up.....meh, it's just alright.  The service was just fine unlike other reviewers' negative experiences, but I find some of these overly chipper servers' rehearsed theatrical presentation of the menu quite annoying.  It's fucking pub food mate....  The menu was stereotypical pub food, nothing too exciting, but I followed the recommendation from our server and I had lamb burger, medium, and wife had fish and chips.    The food was decent, but it tasted just like I would have imagined it would taste like, nothing more, nothing less.  I've had fish and chips in many Irish and Enlish pubs, and this was fairly ordinary, which is OK with me, but $27 for fish and chips?  really?    Lamb burger was juicy with good lamb flavor, but not anything I'd crave for anytime in the near future.    All in all, I have to say that this place is A-ok.  Would I go back to hellish parking structure of Caesars Palace even if all of us locals know the back way from Dean Martin and pay for food that should cost 1/2 as much?    As GR might say....\"no focking way\"....",

    "text": "We were so extremely skeptical after last years disappointment at Gordon Ramsey's burger bar but everyone kept insisting that his restaurants are great. So.. For our last night in Vegas we decided to try here.  After a 15 minute wait we were seated and ordered from our lovely server Jennifer. We ordered the mini burgers (6/10) and lollipop chicken for starters. They both came out super quick (within a few minutes) and while the burgers were ok the bone on my chicken was a bit cold which was strange.. I should have taken that as a hint as I bit into my chicken and realised it had a bloody raw taste and when i spat it out.. I looked down to discover that it was indeed raw.. My poor partner had eaten 3 pieces and thought they tasted weird but did not want to spit them out and after looking over at my raw chicken leg, he really wished he had..  Another server brought our mains over in record time also and we showed him the raw chicken for which he was immediately apologetic and said he would speak to the chef and manager.  Our mains we had the New York Strip Steak (7/10) and the Lamb stew shepherds pie. (7/10) Both were good but it was quite difficult to truly enjoy our meals after being so worried eating raw chicken.. I could not wash that taste out of mouth no matter how many gulps of red wine I had!   The server returned to inform us that the chicken would be removed from our bill (I think this is the least they could do because most likely.. We will both be sick on our 14 hour flight back to australia) and apologised once again.  Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding (8/10) and the salted caramel sundae (8/10). Both were delicious.  Unfortunately it was pretty difficult to recover from serving us raw chicken lollipops. The both of us including 2 pints of cider and a 250ml Pinot noir was $140 plus tips.   So will we be coming back? No.. That's a 2/2 fail rate for Gordon Ramsay's restaurant... Such a shame.",

Along with this horrible experience, they also put $30 of beer that I didn't order on my bill. After that, finally got a glass of wine after waiting 20 minutes. And then was asked to leave!  For added detail, we were sitting in the BAR AREA. Taking up only 2 seats (me and my husband.)    Don't ever eat here if you actually want to sit and enjoy you food. Bad wine.  So enraged, it inspired me to create a Yelp account!!  If eating at Caesar's Palace is like staying at Caesar's Palace I wouldn't waste my money.   Stay at an MGM hotel like Aria or Vdara. First class resorts. I personally recommend Carbone.   UPDATE: I called to complain and they offered me 1 free drink. Ridiculous. I will be going to corporate with this issue.",

Long story short, you can count on less than one finger on the number of times our server came to our table after taking our order--ZERO!  Not sure if a rude server coming frequently with a bad attitude would've been better lol.  But that's ok, didn't want to let him ruin our first meal deal after landing.  Since GR steakhouse and burgers were either sold out from Opentable or too late of a time, this was the next best thing, and I had to get my celebrity chef itch out of the way.  The good:  prime rib: super tender, big chunk, maybe even 16-18 ounces, and not too fatty either.  Yorkshire i've had better  mashed potatoes: ordered another full serving.  the average:  server said the fish and chips were popular, I've had better.  Staying with the server, the bus boy gave us better service, thus he deserved the 15% tip instead, which we gladly gave cash when we left lol.  Our server barely deserved his 5%!  P.S.  took him 10min to get our bill, while he was setting up 2 tables around us....",

I had the Braised Short Ribs (think back to your childhood and Family Sunday Dinners), it was so good and if it was any more tender, it would have melted into the Cheddar Mashed Potatoes.  If you twist my arm and make me find fault with this meal, the baby carrots were just a tad (and I do mean TAD undercooked).  This meal really was so flavorful and enjoyable.  Hubby had Prime Rib and he said that it was very good and very flavorful as well.  Our waiter John, was so enjoyable and help to make this more than a dinner, it was an event that we thoroughly enjoyed.  I tried to kidnap the Chef, Pastry Chef and John, but couldn't fit everyone in the Mini Cooper.  Rats!  So I guess we'll just have to go back and enjoy everyone's company again!  Thank you All !",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay has several restaurants in Vegas, but by Vegas standards, this one is probably my least favorite.  I say Vegas standards, because, in my opinion, you can be more discerning here. There are just so many fantastic restaurants here, and they're all pretty much walking distance from one another.  I've been here twice now. This last time, I was here for a convention, and actually favored going to Mesa Grill, however, the wait was ridiculous, so Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill it was.  I digress, onto the food.  I've had their grilled beef burger as well as their grilled lamb burger. My issue with their burgers is mostly their bun. It could stand being a bit more fresh. It's on the drier, crumbly side. Maybe people just don't order enough burgers here, so their bread doesn't move as fast? For a burger at the $20 mark, it should pretty much be flawless. Their fries are good, and the patties themselves are great.  For a much, much better overall burger, go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, located inside Planet Hollywood.  Service is spot on, and the interior looks great.  Food: 2 Ambience: 5 Service: 5 Value: 2",

It was very crowded, probably about 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night. They were out of at least half of the items on their menu, including basic staples like pies and drinks. Our server failed to tell us ANYTHING and overall was not very pleasant. The food runners were rude and sort of ignored us. The food itself wasn't good- I had a warm chicken sandwich that might have been decent if it wasn't overwhelmed with Gruyere cheese to the point where the bread was soggy and the cheese was all we could taste. The rest of my party was only marginally satisfied with their food. The only good part of the experience was the nice interior. Maybe we came at a bad time, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. It doesn't live up to Ramsay's standards in the slightest.",

The most important thing  that I can generate from this review is the food.   It tastes so fresh and delicious I could just eat a plethora and not get tired of eating here.   I had the braised pork belly. It was so soft, tender and juicy that I wanted more. The seasoning used on this was really delicious.  The pretzel was decent nothing out of this world.

We shared the lobster rolls, I had the New York strip, and he had the fish & chips. The lobster rolls were so fresh and tangy, I was tempted to order more! My steak was cooked just right and was very moist and flavorful and the roasted asparagus that came with it was perfect. My BF's fish and chips were well seasoned and delicious.  Service was great as well. We were a bit intimidated by what seemed like a line as we approached, but everyone was seated promptly. Our server was attentive and our food came out quickly. The only thing that I didn't like was our table. It was right next to another couple, so close it felt like a double date. I think I was sitting closer to the woman next to me than to my BF. Also, it was very noisy which is expected since it is inside a casino, so we couldn't really talk without raising our voices.   Overall, we had a lovely dinner. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a romantic dinner, but it's great for something more casual.",

    "text": "Let me tell you why this place doesn't have more stars...the service!  Plain and simple.  Our server was fairly rude and just going through the motions.  I almost got up and left even before ordering. My whole family (kids included) are HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans.  We couldn't wait to try the food.  Let me say I really wanted the Shepherds pie, but it is only served after 4pm.  My hubby loves a good authentic bangers and mash, so he was set to order.  My son and I decide to share an order of bangers and mash because let's be honest, it was $25!  WOW WOW, OH WOW!  One of the best dishes I have ever had anywhere!  Really!  Oh, let me say, I don't even like sausages of any kind.  But this dish was fabulously delicious.  There were 3 sausages (1 chicken, 1 pork and 1 beef) served over mashed potatoes with an onion gravy.  The onion gravy is the star here.  Ramsay's food did not disappoint!",

Pretzels were old tasting and dry. Beef sliders dry and over cooked. Deviled egg filling was very dry and not creamy in consistency; however the vinegar on egg white shells were good. We asked waitress if Mr. Ramsay was involved in restaurant operations and we were advised he most certainly is; however, it would be beneath him to consider \"amateur\" reviews on Yelp. Waitress indicated the people who work at restaurant are best equipped to know what's good versus customers.   First visit occurred on 5-4-2014 with group of six. Service took 2 hours but food seemed better, lamb burger was reported by my table as delicious. I didn't order food but reserved my opportunity 3 days afterward.  I gave this place 2 stars since the waitress' comments suggest there is no place in their business for customer feedback since owner is celebrity chef and has \"better things to do with his time than to look at Yelp or hear from amateur food critics.\"  Place is not worth the expense.",

They took the time and effort to mix them properly and measure for creations.  Good service there.  Lunch was good not exceptional.  It was not packed but service felt a tiny bit slow.  I had the Fish and Chips.  The Fish was awesome.  Large piece, properly coated, crispy and hot.  I also liked the tartar sauce, to me it was better than normal mayonnaise fare. The chips were just OK, would like to have seen something better than average.  The peas on the side were a touch of flare.  Good taste and a bit of authenticity.  I would like to go back and try the Shepard's Pie.  Looked really good.  This is a Vegas restaurant, not one of his Michelin Star efforts.  I was good with it.  Checked off the list.",

My friend and I thankfully made a reservation for the pretty crowded restaurant and were seated almost immediately.  We were seated in the bar section which was fine, but the seating was unusual - I felt like the seats weren't tall enough for the table.  Aside from that the fish and chips entree was stellar!  I think that possibly the best cooked fish and chips I've ever had.  The batter was light and tasty, perfectly salted and the cod that lay beneath was wonderful.  The tartar sauce was also lovely with the fish.  I couldn't have been happier with my dish.  My friend was a little less satisfied with his meal of the steak and ale pie.  His biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough of it.  I'll agree that the pie was pretty small for the price - but other than that he enjoyed the flavour of the dish.  Perhaps people might be surprised that I rated it a 4/5 but the food was in fact very good.  The service was nice and we enjoyed the experience.  It was a treat to go and I'm happy that we did.",

It was good, but the fries were just regular fries. Not the fries you see in all the Yelp pics and on the Ramsay website.   I was somewhat disappointed - I really wanted the short rib sandwich and the fancy smancy fries. The lamb burger, while it was good, was no where worth $21. Come on Ramsay, I know its Vegas and all, but don't you think $21 for a lamb burger is a bit excessive?   Will I come back? Probably not...",

Such a disappointment for the entire family, except my youngest who got the slider style burger. The slider burgers were flavorful and moist. Wish the whole table had ordered this! The calamari was fried beyond recognition, tasted like eating a mouthful of unseasoned breadcrumbs and so chewy they were literally inedible. My husband and I shared fish n chips and it was so salty I couldn't get past more than one bite. The \"chips\" aka steak fries were soggy and greasy. My picky daughter ordered an $11 side of \"skinny\" fries and although cooked nicely, they had zero flavor. $130 and we all left starving!

Accepting that there would be a Caesar's Palace surcharge on top of already over-priced Vegas food, I assumed that Mr. \"f***ing make this dish right\" Ramsay could provide a decent simulacram of English food.  However, the food was about as English as Excalibur hotel.  If you've actually tasted any English food, please don't go. I miss very little about England, but genuinely good fish & chips + mushy peas is one my favorite things from my childhood.   If you've never tasted mushy peas, this review probably doesn't make sense, but if you have  enjoyed them . . . start planning on that trip to England rather than Vegas, because Ramsay's dish was not even made with the correct peas.  [insert other details about how this place offers weak adaptations of British dishes]  I emailed customer relations, because I am genuinely interested in how Mr. Ramsay could sign his name to those peas: I will update if I hear any sort of authentic response.  PS Service was good: helpful and friendly servers + food seemed made to order, so the individual workers seemed to be doing their best. My criticism solely applies to whomever approved the dishes.",

We went into it wanting to enjoy the experience and have the mind frame of \"let's order whatever we want, money doesn't matter\". But that didn't last long.   The decor is really cool. It's an awesome cozy place to grab a drink or dinner. Again, if money isn't an issue.    Browsed the drink menu, $15 a pop. Ordered a drink each. I had the Goodbye Blue Sky. It was tasty, yet reminded me of pomegranate flavored Emergen-C. For $15 it should have come in a proper tumbler glass instead of some dinky glass.   Instead of ordering entrees, decided to split 2 appetizers.   A Scotch Egg, and the Pie Sampler. I was expecting the pie sampler to come in decent sized custard dishes. Instead they came out in this weird wooden rack that could have held 5 of these tiny dishes. Had they been the custard dish I was expecting, 3 dishes would have easily filled this.  Instead you are left with this massive wooden rack and these tiny awkward dishes.  Kind of cool presentation, I guess?  But really just stupid, and pretentious.  The steak pie was by far the best tasting. The Shepherd's pie, which the waitress suggested had a strange taste and smelled like dirty socks. The chicken pie was decent, yet comparable to one of those frozen Marie Calendar's pot pies you buy in bulk at Costco.  The Scotch egg however was delicious and perfectly cooked.  All said and done, $80 to not even be full or drunk.",

Menu was very different from anywhere else in town.   Decor is VERY VERY COOL! Very Modern British PUB!  It seemed to me to be simply a very special place that is going to bud into an elite restaurant over this next year, being that it just opened.   I've read some of the other reviews and find some of them quite funny. I don't know about you, but I don't go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant for the Coke? Or the pepper for that matter. LOL.   The hostesses Maria and Karen, were sweet, one took the info and the other pleasantly showed me to the bar.   I ate the Beef Cheek and Short Rib Sandwich. Hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten at a restaurant. So tender it melted in my mouth. Good flavors and sauces. It was obviously carefully created by a top chef. The fries were ginormous, but it was fun for a change. Even fry addicts like me enjoy a variation once in a while.   The service was great. Gene took really good care of me. He got my order right away despite having a near full bar. Food came out very fast. Gene seemed sincerely interested in giving me a great experience and frequently checked back. To ask how I liked it. He was quick with the beers and had a smile the whole time.   The bar did seem a bit messy through-out. Piles of napkins and crumbs and what not. But not a big turn off but would expect it to be cleaner.   A manager did stop by (Eva.. Evie..Eve) to kindly check up to make sure everything was good. It was nice because I did not expect it sitting at the bar.   I plan to come back frequently to this place. Seems like a good spot to hang out. Prices all seemed reasonable to me. I will gladly pay more for better product (duh!).   Now good part. They have like 84 beers at this place. I will update it in the future.

    "text": "Before writing this review,  I would just like to state that this is the first time I am writing a restaurant review.  I am picky but not that vocal about it.  If I don'tt like the restaurant I usually suck it up, pay for the meal, and move on.  But honestly,  this was an abomination.  I felt extremely ripped off, disappointed, disgusted and sick so I really think it was necessary that I voice my opinion. I have lost all respect for Chef Ramsay. His restaurant needs to air on his show and shame on him being so harsh to others when he needs to look at himself in the mirror. The hypocrisy.   Here's the way it went down:  We were staying at Caesar's Palace and happened to notice Gordon Ramsay's pub. We got very excited that we would have a chance to try one of his restaurants since we are a fan of Hell's Kitchen and thought we couldn't go wrong.  I usually always check restaurant ratings but I didn't even think twice this time due to chef Ramsay's reputation. Oh how incredibly wrong I was!  First of all, we made reservations for 11 people at 10pm. I couldn't believe that we had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes. I think this is the first time I had to wait when making a reservation.  Furthermore,  there were several open tables and more than enough staff. It wasn't even that busy for a Saturday night so I really couldn't figure out the wait. The thing that I also found baffling was that the hostesses did not seem to be aware of this being and issue and didn't apologize for the wait.   There are two good things I have to say about the restaurants. The decor is okay (love the waiter and hostess apparel!). And our waiter was great. I think he knew how bad the food was and I don't think he will be there very long.   A variety of hotbread was brought out with butter and cheddar sauce about 10 minutes after we ordered.  The bread was good.  The cheddar sauce was terrible.    My husband and I both ordered the corn soup. The soup is supposed to have crab meat. The presentation was nice.   We couldn't find the crab. Our server wasn't informed that they had run out of crab. The waiter offered to switch out the soup with onion soup. That was also bad.  The soup tasted like someone added refined sugar. Totally lacked flavor.  The fish and chips were way too salty and the fish lacked texture and flavor.  The chips/fries were okay.  What the hell is going on with the mooshy peas! Why are they serving baby food to adults at a pub????  The scallops were a little fishy. They were very salty!  Any chef knows that you need little to no salt on scallops. It takes away from the natural flavor. There was a broth on my plate that the scallops were sitting in.  Ew. Small carrots, artichoke and pearl onions were scattered in my plate. Very unattractive dish and I didn't enjoy it at all. I only ate it because I felt really bad about wasting scallops.  The Shepherd's pie was very small and, surprise surprise, it lacked flavor and salt.  Almost forgot to mention it took 45 minutes for our food to come.   Overall,  my friends and I were bummed that we sacrificed a dinner in Vegas for this place. I felt very bad that I'm the one that suggested this place.  McDonalds would have been more satisfying.  None of us will ever go back and I strongly recommend going to one of the many other lovely restaurants in Vegas!",

    "text": "My husband and I made dinner reservations for Gordon Ramsay's Pub with high expectations.  My God, after watching KN & HK, you'd expect nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.  We ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made \"only\" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?  Besides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same \"vision\".  When we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that \"Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great\".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.  Bottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working \"no counts\" like us.",

He had the split pea soup which he loves that particular soup and he said it was  fantastic.  his only criticism was he would have preferred to have it with more peas.  It was a smooth creamy soup.  That's just him, he likes it more chunky.    I had the clams and mussel  in their shells.   As main courses he had the Double Double  burger.   The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy and delicious.   I had the Shepard's Pie. It was flavorful and scrumptious.  Everything was reasonably priced for Las Vegas.   I highly recommend eating here.  It's located in Cesear's Palace.",

I was dissapointed by the current menu, came here last year around the same time and was absolutely blown away by everything and the overall style of the food choices, this year not so much, really narrow options with seriously predictable stuff, it's almost as if I went back in time to when it was first opening and they hadn't quite had time to make up any original dishes so they threw out the ol' classic favorites..  I ordered the scallops, they were ok. Cooked to perfection but nothing else, surprisingly bland! Nothing stunning about them though the portion size was fair. The amazing Girlfriend had the Salmon and it was also bland, almost like they didn't season it, very odd. Friend had the fish and chips. fish was good, batter was excellent, but the \"chips\" were undercooked!   Prices here were also a disappointment. I payed what?! for That!?   At least the Oysters were good!  Must mention service was excellent, and beer selection was good, some tasty stuff on the drink menu.   Maybe next time...",

Nice and light, nicely coated with a light je-ne-sais-quoi that went perfectly!  Couldn't get enough of it!  I've had the (mis)fortune to have eaten a gazillion shepherd's pies, so while this one was certainly delicious and a large portion, it doesn't stand out as particularly remarkable.  But the sticky toffee pudding was most certainly NOT normal.  It was just incredible.  More of an upside down muffin than I guess what Yanks think of as pudding (jello) ... light, fluffy, TASTY, drenched in caramel sauce with just a little salt and a scoop of fresh made ice cream that melts in the warm sauce.  Nice.  Staff was friendly, attentive, and fun; knowledgeable of dining and mixology, I struck up a short conversation about new restaurants/mixing with a bartender (M, it was Pizza Rock, not Naked City).  I didn't favor the uniforms but I can see how they work and they weren't a distraction.  Would take any of my limey friends here any time, I think they would love it.",

Love the vibe they have goin' on....waitstaff in Brittish Punk looking attire complete with Doc Martens, newspaper print dresses sported by the hostesses, beer kegs on the wall, sweet lighting and woodwork throughout the restaurant, very cozy and inviting.  Our server Elise was awesome during our visit offering her expertise in food and drink selections, but the only bummer was that they were out of Duck Confit that day, so we couldn't feast on the very popular Duck Poutine..:( No worries though, we all shared the following off the Pub menu:  DEVILISHLY DEVILED EGGS Self explanatory, good, but anyone can make this at home  SHEPHARD'S PIE A hearty mix of beef, lamb and veggies combined with butterylicious mashed potatoes...One of Ramsay's popular signature dishes,very good and comforting  CLAMS AND MUSSELS IN SAFFRON BROTH Cooked expertly, very delicious, and use the crostini to sop up all that saffron love!  SHORTRIB AND BEEF CHEEK SANDWICH This sandwich is in its own category, possibly one of the tastiest sandwiches you'll ever sink your teeth into...Perfectly braised shortrib, deep-fried beef cheek with arugula, aioli, and sweet onion jam served with gargantuan steak fries as big as my hand? Definitely the star of the night! the Innis & Guinn went perfectly with all of these selections too.  Definitely returning for the duck poutine, that is if my opu doesn't pull a jedi mind trick into getting another sandwich!.....ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(12/100) \"Gordon's Gastropub\"",

Having a business owner I was delighted at the hostess station was well organized and seating was within a very reasonable time for a very busy Saturday night. My husband loved the Bangers and Mash ( belongs to the clean plate club ) I had the BLT PUB. Excellent on both! Our server was funny and very efficient. Our second time a few days later we brought our daughter and son-in-law. She the chicken curry he the burger and we split the fish and chips.  Our server was very knowledgeable and funny. She told us Gordon was going to be in on Friday ( we were leaving that day ) but there was an event in April 2017 that we should come back for . This is going to be a usual stop for us from now on. Thank you for the great dining experience!",

It's pub/bar food...it's Vegas so it ain't cheap...everything I've had both visits has been great. Nuts, picked veggies (could have actually been pickled even more for my taste), Mac&Cheese, sliders, shrimp cocktail, fish and chips and the beet salad all were really well done and seasoned well. It's a fun atmosphere with good drinks and for my $ I really good lunch option. This is not fine dining but for a slightly elevated pub, it's really good.",

The second I sat down, I sinkend into the comfy armchairs, and I started admiring the beer keglined the Pub's wall, and wondering what should I get for lunch.  I knew I was getting the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Oh my goodness! I wish if I can have it as entree, if only my friend didn't ask me not to put on a show LOL. I'm telling you it is to die for and so addictive.  So for my entree, I got the classic steak & ale pie. When my pie arrived, it was small but after the first bite I realized how filling and flavorful my pie was. Very flaky and crispy perfectly golden brown crust made with  tender mouth-watering pieces of beer braised beef in delicious dark rich gravy. You cannot beat Ramsay! Four Yelps!",

We chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis & Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.     The first entree was the \"Dublin Brisket\" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.    My wife wanted the \"Shepard's Pie\" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.  A truly awesome dish that I would gladly have any cold weather day.    We skipped all the good looking appetizers and small plates just to make it to dessert.  Everyone recommended the \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" so that's what we had and it did not disappoint.  The perfect ending indeed.",

Just a little claim to fame anecdote.  I hope you guys find it impressive because I tell this story at least 2-3 times a week.  My BF and I are both really big fans of Gordon Ramsay and our favorite show to watch together is Kitchen Nightmare.  This Pub & Grill seemed like a nightmare, to a small degree of course.  One thing Gordon Ramsay boasts on the show is a small fresh menu.  The menu was far from small and seemed to have everything under the sun.   What I ordered was pretty impressive.  It combined everything I loved.  Scallops, clams, in a chowder broth with BACON.  BACON BACON BACON.  Love me some BACON.  Although the food was delicious the price left me wanting more.  I had the scallop dish and my BF had the fish and chips.  Our tab was nearly $75 with tip.  And, NO we did not order soda or alcohol.  Food here was good but not worth the price.  You are better off going to the food court a few feet away.",

I had better food, I had great service, and I spent less than I would have at the buffet for that weekend!  My girlfriend loved the braised pork belly dish and I was glad to have their Fish n Chips with a side of beer. The fish and chips was well prepared and it was a very generous portion.  It was served with a rosemary tartar sauce and garlic mayo.  I really enjoyed it.  My top recommendation is that you absolutely cannot miss Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding.  It was so good that I'm going to plan to stop at this restaurant the next time I'm in town.  I was happy to find out that this dessert is a staple at most of his restaurants.  If you have the opportunity...get that dessert!  It's a warm toffee pudding - the consistency of bread pudding - and it's served with a hot caramel sauce and cream fraiche ice cream.  It isn't overly sweet and it's a very well balance mixed of flavors.  Next time I come back, I really want to try their braised beef cheek sandwich and shepherd's pie.  Overall...my girlfriend and I were really glad that we made the detour for this pub!",

One month later I am still craving it! My husband had the bangers and mash, those were some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had in my life! We will definitely go back next time we are in Vegas!",

The service was top notch with a great and attentive waiter, use of the iPad to tell descriptions and pictures helped.  The good however was average. I wanted a burger, any kind really and all they had were sliders at dinner. These sliders were tiny, bread over buttered and average taste. The fries side was excellent!! Way more fries than any one person can eat! His fish and chips were average. We were going to share fries but he didn't get more than a handful. The fish was ok but too much butter in the batter. The other couple agreed! The dessert I got the toffee cake and it was too rich, everyone took a bite and we still couldn't finish it. The other couple got the berry parfait, I believe strawberry and said it was wonderful. It was finished before I looked up.  Fun night, we sat there talking for awhile and felt kind of rushed to leave.... But we stayed till we all decided to walk around anyway! Off to shopping when in Caesars!!!",

    "text": "I didn't know what to expect from the Pub & Grille. I knew Ramsey's name was attached and that might mean really awesome food or just a cash grab trying to lure dumb tourists into paying twice as much for their food...  The restaurant is really well designed and looks cool especially the wall of kegs. The waiters wear vests and have these little satchels. Pretty well themed.  As far as service, your water never drops below half way. The lady was on top of it!  Our waiter though was lazy, lingered, and only checked on us after we finished the vast majority of the meal. What if I wanted more than a thimble of ketchup? He seemed bored and pretentious. Plus he messed up our order. No bacon on one and the other was undercooked.  As far as food goes, what a straight rip off. 21$ for a burger with bacon and fries. I'm not sure if they ran out to Carl's Jr and grabbed up a bunch of 6$ burgers because that's all I tasted. Bland, small, and overpriced. The fries were tasty but really greasy and like I complained before all you get is a simple thimble of ketchup.  Our host had Prime Rib. His plate looked like he went to a Claim Jumper but was priced like a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  In the end I just I picture Mr. Ramsey rolling over in his... giant pile of money.",

No dairy, by the way either - just the way I need it to be. Toast/bread was crispy and fresh and so good in the soup. We also shared the olives - amazing! And the salmon spread was to die for. Beers were cold and refreshing and service was very very good. We waited a bit between visited from our waiter, but that was okay. Very good.",

    "text": "My wife and I got into Vegas around dinner time so we decided to come over to the Pub & Grill to try it out for dinner. First when we arrived they told us it was an hour wait, but instead of having to hang around they ask for your cell phone number to text you when your table is ready. That really worked out well, first we got a text right away saying our estimated time, and about 30 minutes later we got a text our table was ready. Very cool to be able to do your own thing while you wait.   So overall the food is pretty good, however for the prices they charge it is not worth the value. We started by splitting a vegetable salad, and that was really good but the salad itself costs $16, way over priced.   I had a steak which was pretty good, and my wife had the shepherds pie which is pretty similar in taste to Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding which was pretty good as well.   All in all the food was decent, but it just does not live up to value. When my wife and I ate at the Steak restaurant we walked away with $160 bill and felt it was well worth the money. This place however the food is good, but it is not something I am willing to pay the high price to come back for.",

Nothing special, but it was tasty.  Then we did not see the waiter again for at least 10-15 minutes and we wanted to order, ugh.  We ordered and then it was about 50 minutes before the food came.  My friends order was wrong and they had to fire up a new meal for her which took another 12 minutes and came out cooked incorrectly.  I went with simple sides and they were ok - cauliflower au gratin, creamed spinach/kale, mashed potatoes and brussel  sprouts.  My other friend had shepherd's pie and said it was ok.  Based on the poor service, wrong orders, incorrect cooking of orders and that the food was just ok they're only getting 2 stars.  Plus the prices are Vegas high and you can get a much better experience and food for similar price at so many other places in Vegas.",

    "text": "I am sad to say that our experience here wasn't as pleasant as we had hoped. Our wait time from the time we ordered our food was 50 minutes. Yes, we actually timed it. Our waiter came to tell us that the food would be just a few more minutes at about 30 minutes into the waiting period. We never once heard back from him after that. Once he brought out our food, he just dropped it off and said, 'enjoy.' We clearly needed more water, which never got refilled as we dined. Our server never acknowledge or address the long wait. He also actively avoided us before and after bringing out our entrees.   We ordered Shepard's Pie, Scottish Salmon, & Rack of Lamb. The lamb was mostly fat and gristle. The Shepard's Pie was good. The Scottish Salmon was good. The bread & cheddar cheese sauce was amazing.   We would have loved to try the desserts, but we didn't feel like waiting or dealing with the bad service anymore.  Overall, the service was lacking but the food was okay. The best part was the bread and the Innis & Gunn beer. Unfortunately, I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on our first experience.",

    "text": "It was my birthday and I wanted to go someplace special. I've heard amazing things about the Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill. I made sure I called and made a reservation a couple weeks in advanced for lunch.   When we got there everything was set! We were seated quickly at a large table in the back. It was cool because I could lean back in the seat I was in and see right into the kitchen, which was awesome!! Our waiter took our drink orders while my party arrived and looked over the menu. Pricey yes! But I totally knew this going in and was not shocked. My fellow Yelper and good friend Dyanna L. asked the waiter what his suggestions were. First thing out of his mouth was the Seared Scallops. This totally helped me in my picking process!   Ok, so for the food, it was ALL excellent! Let me start out with the appetizers. We ordered the Mini Pub Burgers which were three perfect little sliders with bacon, lettuce, onion, and a little side of mayo. The Calamari was fried perfectly and they even used the leg parts (my fav) it came with a side of tartar sauce and a side of cocktail sauce. The Deviled Eggs I did not try, but the presentation was awesome. Instead of the eggs being filled you get to fill the eggs yourself! We also ordered the warm pretzels that came with a delicious cheese spread and a tangy mustard.   For our entrees I finally decided on the Seared Scallops. Yummy!!! They were perfectly cooked and came in a cream broth with small clams, leeks, and potatoes! I wanted to tip the bowl up and drink the rest of the broth, but I remembered my manners. lol My husband chose the Shepards Pie. It was tender and filled to the brim with meat and veggies! Dyanna L. chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Omg was it filled with lobster!!! I was in heaven when she offered me a bite! She also had a Caesar Salad that looked very tasty! Her boyfriend got the Fish and Chips. It looked so crispy. I'm totally getting that next time! My other friend Rachael ordered the Mini Pie Tasting. It came with three little pies one was a Shepards Pie. The other was a Steak and Ale Pie. That was her favorite one. The last of the three was a Chicken Pot Pie. My other friends Becki and Eric got Lamb Burgers that where huge and came with crispy fries!   Other than the service being a little slow, it was a great experience overall, but I think it was because our original waiter was sent home in the middle of our visit. I loved all the food. This is a great place for a special occasion! Just be prepared to drop some cash, but it's completely worth it! Yummy!",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I am not a Vegas person.  I don't drink or gamble so it really has little to offer for me.  Typically I am only in town because of work and this was no different.  However, when in town I am always open to a great meal and after being stuck on the 15 Fwy on the drive up from CA I was ready for something special.   It is right off the casino floor in Caeser's and it was hopin'.  Suffering from freeway fatigue, neither my wife nor I were in the mood to get too crazy trying something new so I went with the safe choice of rotisserie chicken and mash potatoes in hopes of heading back to the room in a food coma.  The service was good and the food came out quickly.  The chicken was certainly flavorful but nothing special.  The mashed potatoes, far from the comfort food serving I was hoping for, were okay.  But to me, that was the problem.  I was getting hit for nearly $40 just for this chicken and it was just okay.  Now I understand, this is Vegas, a high rent district so I accept I am not getting chicken at a Pollo Loco rate but for that kind of money it needs to far surpass Pollo Loco quality.  It didn't.  Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't bad nor did it look like something that came out of a paper bag but I was disappointed.  When spending that kind of money, you shouldn't be leaving the restaurant hungry.  We ate in the food court for the remainder of the week.",

We tried the Scotch Egg, Lobster Roll, and Short Rib Kettle Chip Nachos for apps then shared a Steak and Ale Pie for our main. We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. All were prepared and presented well. Lots of great tastes and rich flavors.   The service was outstanding. Our server timed everything perfectly. She helped us make good choices and took care to ensure we were 100% satisfied.   The prices were typical for Vegas and we felt the value was good. Overall we were happy with our visit and would recommend the restaurant to all travelers. Make a reservation as they are quite busy. Very much a Pub environment.",

    "text": "Wow. Wow. Wow. 5 stars all the way around! If you have never visited this amazing pub or if you have been several times, every time is perfection.  Located in Ceasars Palace near Celine Dion's show room is one of Gordon Ramseys best restaurants and a hidden gem.   Walking in the atmosphere is a lively jovial pub with comfortable seating and upscale decor. There are several rooms for seating with various furniture components all designed with comfort for a long stay.  Our server today was Adam, very friendly and knowledgable. His suggestions made our meal and experience! Kudos to you :)  The menu is very specific based on a British pub. However what stands out most are the rare finds and delicacies fused with common dishes. Such as the Lamb Burger or Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. All of which is very reasonably priced for the quality and receipe design.  Now on to the best part... the food!! We ordered: 1. Pub Burger - well done  $21 10/10 absolute perfection. The burger was caramelized evenly giving each bite a savoring flavor and rich texture.  2. Ruben Sandwich $23 10/10 outstanding flavor. Moist and savory, each bite was devine with strong flavor.  3. Sticky Toffy Pudding (Free with YELP check-in) 10/10 HIGHLY RECCOMEND Gorden Ramesys signature desert is done the absolute best justice at this pub.  Soft warm toffee pudding made fresh to order with vanilla ice cream and melted caramel drizzled over top. Each bite was absolute perfection.   This was our best trip to the pub yet! Shout out to Adam for his awesome service. We can't wait to come back again.",

First of all, it isn't exactly like an English or Irish pub, but it's ambiance is fresh! Service was an A-, and the food was awesome, but could have been better. I had the fish and chips for dinner and it was average at best, I've had better in local restaurants in Alaska, to be honest. And my girlfriend had the soft shell crab sandwich and when I said just describe it, she said, \"meh, it's okay.\" HOWEVER, the dessert makes up for every average thing about this spot, the sticky toffee pudding is absolutely. Amazing.  Order it every time, or you just suck.",

The hostess basically told us that we couldn't be seated until 8, which I totally understand and we weren't even asking to be seated before then, only to let her know that we were here. However, she was so short, that we felt really rushed away. I get now that it's probably because they don't really have a waiting area, but this was our first time to this restaurant, so we didn't realize that.   Once we returned at 8pm, we were seated right away at the last high bar table. It was easily the worst seat in the restaurant. The end of our table (separated by the metal kegs) was used as part of the bussing station, and so we were constantly getting waters put down on the other side, which made the entire table shake and was really disconcerting. My seat also directly looks into the casino, which as a personal preference I didn't like.   The food was mehh. Given the experience we had had up until this point, we ordered two things to share, the pigs in a blanket and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was fine, nothing special, and a little bland, but we did eat it all. The pigs in a blanket were underwhelming. Both my boyfriend and I had small pieces of bone in the sausage, and we didn't eat the third one. Since we checked in on Yelp, we were able to get a free sticky toffee pudding, which was dry if not for the ice cream, and had none of that sticky toffee flavor that I expected.   For the price of the food, I was extremely disappointed. I would never eat here again, and I have a feeling if Gordon Ramsey ate here, he'd be livid.",

I didn't want to send it back since the food already took so long to get to the table. We had a party of 8 so I'm sure that caused the delay. The fries and burger were good, it just wasn't anything life changing.   My friend next to me ordered the lobster roll. She shared a piece and wow. That was amazing. The roll was crispy and light. Perfectly buttery. And the lobster was delicious. I definitely should have ordered that instead.   I ordered God Save The Queen. It was a really good cocktail.   So the burger fries and two cocktails came out to about $55. I thought the burger at The Kitchen on Fremont street kicked this burger's butt. So go check that place out instead.",

Our server was doing his best but looked like he had no support from anyone bussing tables.  What I guess was some type of manager visited a table next to us during our 2 hour dinner literally 15 times - and quickly came by once early in our meal to check in.  Reminded me of some of the shlub managers Ramsey runs in to on Kitchen Nightmares.   Another manager at the hostess station was also a waste - we had 8:30p reservations and arrived promptly, we were asked by three different people why we were waiting - including a manager, who when we said we had reservations asked if they were for 7:45p - presumably to give us grief for showing up late... but then just turned and walked away - rude!!!  I am a huge fan of Ramsay's TV shows -  so really wanted to like the whole experience, but it just wasn't happening. Luckily we had no specific plans for after dinner, because I never would have thought a pub and grill dinner would take two hours (it should not have - just inefficient).  Sheppard's Pie and Fish and Chips were very good. Sticky Toffee pudding was outstanding.",

I followed up by asking if the bar was open, to which I got a condescending response of yes. Finally the manager came over, to which I asked why I have to be the one who has to inquire on the bar being open seating. The manager gave me lip service so I decided this establishment was not worth my money. As I walked away, the hostesses continued to laugh. I would recommend staying away from somewhere that has zero customer service and clearly doesn't appreciate their clientele. In the end, I strolled over to Spago just a couple steps away and it was well worth the walk. Do yourself a favor - go to Spago :)",

The lunch portion was perfect, for $17 I think. I came back during dinner and ordered it, and even though it wasn't listed on their dinner menu, they made it anyway and it was $14. The only suggestion I have is to just make the lunch size $14 as well because it seems ridiculous to charge more during the day, and not as much at night especially since you're making the same dish. But, the food was very delicious. Our service was great both times, and the decor is awesome. No complaints!   I would highly recommend it, and if you go, you must get the truffle macaroni and cheese! It's perfectly creamy and scrumptious!",

Highlights were the scallops and as crazy as it sounds the spinach side (forget the name, but its ridiculous). As for the rest of it... Service - pretty Awful (slow, inattentive, and gave off a couldn't care less vibe) Atmosphere - Good, Prices - Fairly Steep (but then again Vegas is kinda pricey these days) we hit Vegas every year and always take a lap or three through Caesar's even when we aren't staying there, but I can say that we probably won't be hitting this Pub again when we're back in town.",

We would have loved to try the sticky toffee pudding for dessert (mostly to compare it to Bobby Flay's) but our waiter couldn't be bothered to stop by our table. We sat with our silverware on our plates after finishing our entrees for thirteen minutes and eight seconds before the plates were finally cleared away. Yes, we timed it. And then we sat for another eleven minutes and fifty two seconds before the waiter came over to ask if we wanted dessert. Nope, just the check now. Dessert probably would've taken another half hour!   Each time we've been to Vegas, we choose to stay at Caesar's Palace because the customer service is superb. Mesa Grill, Bacchanal, Homestead, Hyakumi... five-star service. Even Munch Bar had awesome service. Ramsay's just didn't measure up.   I still love Gordon but I think he needs to start yelling at his front of the house staff ASAP.",

    "text": "So you would think a very public british chef that makes a tv career reforming failing restaurants with \"Kitchen Nightmares\" or spends his time mentoring (read: for the most part screaming at and using a marine sergeants approach in the kitchen) up and coming chefs would really have a venue baring his name locked down tight.  Sadly no. Just no. In fact \"HELL NO\".  I came in with a group of 5 people to celebrate a birthday and try an early dinner since the latest winner of Hell's Kitchen had arrived 2 weeks ago. From my experience I feel like a bad friend for suggesting the place.  Really when you goto a restaurant there are 3 different things that you rate the place by: atmosphere (looks), food, and service. You measure your expectations of these things by location, chef, and price. So lets run down the list shall we?  The place itself is on the main casino floor of caesars casino and they had a great time decorating it with a lot of british pub flair that still is up beat and modern looking. So really they nailed it here. The bar area is very inviting and tvs on the walls make it comfy and the restaurant area is equally inviting.   The problem of course is when you go to order the actual food. As I said we came in for an early dinner (6pm) so the venue was fully staffed and maybe only 20% full with patrons. This should be an easy task for the staff. But, my experience rendered that assumption otherwise. To be fair our waiter was extremely up beat and full of suggestions and we were sat quite quickly so I can put most of the onus of service issues on back of house. But upon ordering it took almost 30 minutes for the table to get their alcoholic drinks. That just doesn't ring well with anyone. Especially a group of people that are in the mood to celebrate. Whats even worse is the food took well over 40 min before appetizers and starters came out with one of the more attentive managers checking in on us the entire time being very shocked that food was moving so slow that I could have walked into the mall, ordered food at any other place, taken it to go, and eaten it before our starters came out.   So lets talk about whats really most important, the food! Since we were in a group of mixed friends that all love to eat we kind of did a one of everything approach to our starters and shared whatever came out. This would be cool if there was some hit or misses but, in our case the entire table just got more disheartened right up front after the long wait which is kind of a great way to crush the excitement and spirits of your guests prior to the main course I guess. The sliders were way over cooked, the fried calamari was bland, the scotch egg was downright forgettable, the toad in the hole should have stayed in whatever hole it came from as it was absent of any real flavor, and the lobster roll had an odd after taste to it (more on this later). The only positives here were the fries and the lollipop wings. In fact we scarfed the fries because they were the only thing stood out as not just edible but tasty with the included aioli.   So lets say if you order starters the only thing nearly worth while are the fries. From a british gastropub? Wrong on so many levels.  So now lets move onto the main course. Something you would want to do in a decent time after the first round of food. But, the kitchen staff had the idea of letting us wait till we were really hungry for it before serving it. Yes I am being sarcastic, no it wasn't cool, and as you can guess it was far from worth the wait. So the main course comes after 2 more rounds of drinks that took to long and a manger was still \"shocked\" at the food service time. If you're counting at home do the math and you can see this is entirely too long. The next round of food included the wedge salad that wasn't even a wedge and the dressing didn't even have the right to call itself Bleu Cheese as it lacked any flavor and was so watery we wondered what the dressing did to offend the chef, the scallops that hey were cooked perfectly yet lacked any trace of seasoning, the lobster mac & cheese that we all agreed should have skipped the lobster, the chicken pot pie with a perfect crust yet lacked any flavor from the inside ingredients and the short rib that was so unbelievably void of the texture and flavor that it was sent back with the question of why a place like this would serve something that is supposed to be flavorful and tender but comes off like a bad croc pot version of pot roast. The one shining positive was the BLT which we all agreed just nailed it.  So after trying almost half the menu we are left with fries and the BLT being the only things that are positive standouts? At this price point?!?!? Are you kidding me?   When it comes to dessert the sticky toffee pudding was however to die for.   Oh remember the lobster? Yeah all 3 people that had it felt slightly ill after. This place is a kitchen nightmare. Such a let down and a terrible experience.",

    "text": "'Semi' Enjoyed a dinner at Gordon's pub but various issues kept it from earning more than 3 stars Sunday Oct 4. First, the hostess, trained yes, competent, not really. Poorly handled phone res and directions. As locals we hadn't been here and hosted my brother and friend, party of 4 plus child. The waiter was nice, simple in his approach, friendly, etc. but I hate it when the have deliver/expediter servers that come and drop off food without really knowing who has what, no sense for service, unfriendly and unengaging and close to being rude. Both food delivery people-a guy for our apps and a lady for the salads were basically rude. Uninterested in serving, embarrassing for the fact that the restaurant was barely busy. I feel Bad for being their table tonight. The waiter did provide some nice choices for my wife and I to dine locally as we just moved here which, was above and beyond, and for that he earned his 18% tip. The lighting went high to low twice during dinner. Amateur hour? I personally question the pricing on the beers and the wines too. I'm in F&B consultancy/marketing with large corporate accounts and my take here is their beer pricing is too high. Ok, expensive to be expensive- I get that, it's Vegas tourism, but portion sizes should be questioned too. I had the Kale and Bacon Shepherds Pie. Mistake. Ok to Good-yes, small-oh yes!!! It was a French onion soup size bowl filled half way with a puff pastry on top. Are you kidding? I don't even want to know what that cost me! 300 bucks later, left hungry. Thank goodness for wives that leave portions for their husbands to eat. Won't recommend.",

Bar service was average, but the free appetizer was very good (pretzels w/ dips - not good just because it was free.)  Second visit - dinner with my lady. Great service and average food. I had the shepherds pie. Good, but expected great for the price. Pint of Lagunitas IPA was $11.....   Third visit - just about midnight and the hostess asked if I just wanted drinks. As my answer was yes, I followed the group of 4 that were just ahead of me into the bar area. The main bar was full, so I took a seat at the end of the adjacent bar, a mere 5 feet from the main bar.  With a slight lean, I could have touched the shoulder of the gentlemen at the end.  After waiting for about 5 minutes and repeated eye contact with the main bar bartenders, a lady came up to let me know they were closed.  So I asked why the hostess showed me in... I was told they may be open at the main bar... 5ft away... But as far as she knew, they were closed.  My disappointment comes from 2 directions:  - big name with a reputation, I had high expectations.  Didn't come close.  - outspoken critic of poor restaurants is failing at this location. Might want to pay a visit to the establishment with your name on it...  On the other hand - Ramsay's Burgr at Planet Hollywood is FABULOUS.  We have been there 3 times and received impeccable service and food every time!",

My entre salad was just lettuce and pears so it was lacking another component- pecans, blue cheese, something! It was disappointing. I would not recommend that item. My husband got the shepherds pie, which again tasted fine just not worth the price and it was smaller than I expected. We shared the toffee dessert which again was good but still average for a dessert.   We just didn't think it was worth it. We wouldn't go here again.

We both asked for mid-rare and received a grey patty that made my heart sink when I saw it.  Here's the rub, and I don't mean delicious BBQ seasoning... it took 30 minutes to arrive and it was $20.  Ok, ok, so it's The Vegas Strip, that can explain the exorbitant price, but 30 minutes for an overcooked, boring, bland and disappointing burger doesn't fly in my world no matter the location.

I paid 25$ for lobster roll at Lobster Me but that was a waste compared to the 20$ here for the lobster Mac and cheese. The food is not pricey here. (As per Vegas strip standards lol)",

My boyfriend is often less than impressed with restaurant food, and he finished every bite of his steak and ale pie. The taste of it I had was amazing.  I wish I could remember our servers name, because she was excellent.  For a beer, soda, app, and 2 entrees, we spent $100 before tip. Taking into account portion sizes, it wouldn't seem worth it, but the quality was amazing, and we left with very full stomachs.",

We chose the Pub because they had Shepard's Pie and also because it wasn't too fancy.   The restaurant is located inside the Caesar's Palace casino right next to the Forum Shops and the Colosseum. I loved the decor as it really transported you to Great Britain. Our server was great and was quick and friendly. I ordered the Steak and Ale pie and my boyfriend had the Shepard's Pie- we shared a side of Green Beans. Everything was great! The flavors in my dish grew as I continued eating and though the portion doesn't look like much, I was stuffed!! We were so full but our server highly recommended the Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding, which was their specialty and since we were on vacation, we couldn't turn it down. It was delicious! It sounds super sweet, but it actually wasn't. I would definitely recommend it.  We really enjoyed our time here and would love to try some of his other restaurants next time around!",

We were greeted by our server Adam whom was prompt, Courteous, friendly, attentive and made the meal that much more enjoyable. He honored the happy hour for us even though it had been \"discontinued\" but we had seen it on the menu display outside the restaurant. We were all wanting a quick bite and being I had ordered off of the happy hour menu before and loved it, that is why we decided to go to the Pub.             We ordered truffle fries, pretzels, sliders, pub nachos, and quite a few rounds of beers. The food was awesome and what you would expect from Gordon Ramsey. Your really couldn't beat the price either. I will be going back there many many more times and want to try all of Chef Ramsey's restaurants.",

This would be excusable if the quality of the food was worthwhile but I had one of the worst fish and chips I've experienced. With it being a featured item, located in Caesars Palace, had 'Pub' in the name and associated with a famous chef I had some hope.   The fries weren't crisp, the fish was small in portion and both the fish and batter tasted off. I had planned to get dessert and a second beer (the suggested pairing for the meal, which was the one solid portion of the meal) but the entree turned me away. The peas compliment to the meal was interesting and I had hoped for something to interest the palate, but it too fell short. It gave hints of something that had once been good but with neglect had turned bland and just yet another in a chain of neglect.   I will avoid this restaurant in the future and be wary of Gordon Ramsey branded restaurants in the future. There are better places within walking distance, avoid.",

The lamb Shepherd's pie was excellent, the beer list was great, ambiance was classy, and service was stellar. I couldn't wait to return.   On my recent jaunt, my friend and I are there twice in two days, and again, it couldn't have been better. First, the cocktails were huge and strong and perfectly balanced. The lobster roll appetizer was insane! Best we've had outside of the East Coast. The bread was soft and buttery, and full of tender, sweet hunks of Maine lobster. No skimping.   We also shared a corned beef sandwich that was hands down the best I've ever had thanks to the mouth-watering, well-marbled meat that was not salty at all and the exquisite preparation, with delicious rye bread grilled expertly; luscious, melted cheese; and lip-smacking sauerkraut.   Same for the steak pie, chock full of the most tender cubes of beef in an addictive gravy. The lobster mac and cheese also was a winner, with claw meat on top and strewn with bits of buttery chunks. Asparagus was simply delicious, grilled perfectly and served with a delicate Bernaise sauce on the side.   Service on all trips was top-rate; these people are trained well (no surprise there if you've ever seen one of Ramsey's TV shows). I asked the bartender jokingly if he ever met the man himself, and to my surprise, he said yes, a few times. Apparently Ramsey is quite attentive to his properties and gracious to his employees in real life. Everyone seems to enjoy their job. We also appreciate the fact that we saw plenty of people of color in the front of the house.   The prices might seem steep at first blush, particularly if you're not used to coastal cities, but you do get your money's worth in terms of quality and portion size. I wish Ramsey would open one in San Francisco - I'd be a regular!",

The hostess asked for our name and asked us to wait to be seated, ok no problem.  A few minutes later a waitress called our name and showed us to our table. The table was a high top with stools with no backs. I explained I couldn't sit at such a table due to back issues and asked to be seated at one of the open regular tables...there were plenty. She asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't and she said the lower tables are only for customers with reservations. Again, I explained I have lower back trouble and cannot sit at a high top with a tall stool, where my legs dangle and there isn't a back on the stool. She simply looked at us and said sorry, the lower tables are for those with reservations. With that, we turned and walked away....why are you chasing hungry, paying guests away for something like that??? We ended up at Old Homestead Steakhouse right around the corner and had an awesome 5 star meal and experience, so I guess, all in all, thanks for the subpar customer service because Old Homestead knocked it out of the park!",

Once the server got our order, her face got changed bad, even though the total price was $70. The soup was soso, but the wellington was disgusting. We were trying to eat the food, but while I was chewing, a sharp wooden thing was stuck to my gum. We talked about our situation to a manager, he never said sorry to us, he just kept saying what is that? or it looks something wooden. We felt so bad about their service, and I want to say \"Go if you wanna ruin your day.\"",

I was seated promptly at a high top table in the bar area close to the railing opened to the casino floor.  I got an iced tea, and I ordered bangers and mash for the main course and chocolate trifle for dessert.  The bangers and mash were OK.  Three small sausages of chicken, beef, and pork served with a modicum of mashed potatoes and with some onion gravy and fried onion sticks.  It was a small portion for a mere $24.  The chocolate trifle was very good--it made the evening.  It was made with both light and dark chocolate and topped with Chantilly cream.  There were two small cookies with the trifle.  It wasn't overly sweet.  Service was OK.  My server was a very pleasant woman.  While she brought my iced tea quickly, she was never back to ask about refills.  A busser was going around refilling water glasses so that was a help.  This is a convenient place to go for dinner when going to the Colosseum but it is Strip pricing plus.  I think another time I'll go to the food court.  There are several options and they'd be much less pricey than this.",

We had a reservation and were seated almost immediately. Atmosphere was nice. Very loud though. So loud, in fact, that we had a difficult time hearing the waiter. Plenty of televisions and a decent atmosphere nonetheless. We were a large group and food was delivered in a timely manner. Drinks were kept filled and we were checked on accordingly. The food, while pricey, was good. Burgers all around and a seafood plate. All delicious. All-in-all not a bad place but I think due to price and location being so far inside the building that unless promoted by friends, I don't think we'll visit again. A great experience though and definitely a part of \"The Vegas Trip\".",

    "text": "Dear Chef Ramsay, are we not worthy?    Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.  The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.  The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.  The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.  Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!  Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.  The dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by decor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.    If you're wearing a t-shirt that says \"I love Las Vegas\" go right on in.  This is your kind of place.",

We ordered cocktails and 20+ minutes later they arrived. Mine tasted like cough syrup. The appetizers arrived quickly, the meal did not. So far we are 35 minutes into this ordeal without our entrees. The food arrived and was \"okay\". Definitely not amazing and required salt. Do yourself a favor-- STAY AWAY from this place!  Update: I complained and the waitress said \"Good news, I was able to comp 5 of your drinks\". So, there were 7 of us drinking, so 5 wasn't even a round. Additionally, I was seeking compensation. I wanted to speak to the manager about how awful the whole experience was. The manager didn't even bother to come over!!!!! At this point, I thanked the waitress and asked to speak to the manager. He came over and acted dumbfounded that I didn't care about getting stuff for free, I truly believe a manager should come apologize and get feedback to improve the experience.   This whole place was a disaster.",

I ordered the truffle fries, ultimate burger and lobster mac n cheese.  I didnt like that they didnt have American cheese for my burger but, it was good. The truffle mayo for dipping the fries was good. My only complaint with the food was the lobster mac n cheese. It wasnt what I expected. It was watery and reminded me of stouffers microwave mac n cheese. The manager asked how I liked it and I told him what I thought. I also asked how did they prepare it. He said \"well like any other mac n cheese we prepared it over the stove.\" I thought it would of been baked, which would of molded the cheeses together and gave the top a golden brown. We walked away with a 95 dollar bill. It was good I got to taste it but I wouldn't go back. Another good thing was that he took the mac n cheese off the bill seeing that I only took like two bites. I think that with a full 5 star restaurant you can justify the prices but for a pub, it was way to expensive. I just have to add that I am pissed because I saw a pic of someone's mac n cheese and mine looked nothing like it. They had huge chunks of lobster and what looked like crumbled truffles of cheese on top.",

I had been looking forward to coming here as soon as we decided to go to Las Vegas, and had high expectations that just were not met.   I'll start off with my one and only positive comment about this place the service was pretty good. They waiters were friendly and fairly attentive.   Now to my laundry list of why this place was a major disappointment:  1. The food was mediocre at best, and inedible at worst. I came in and thought \"hey I'm at Gordon Ramsey's Pub, I'll have the Fish 'n Chips. I bet they'll be fantastic!\". Wrong! It's more like Fish 'n Wedges..flavorless, unseasoned, & cold wedges. The fish was ok, but not  even note worthy. I've had better Fish 'n Chip's at the local Chippy at Brixham harbor..  2. The prices were disproportional to the quality of the food..if you want me to be happy about paying $30 for Fish n Chips, and $5 for a diet Coke it had better be fricken amazing. It wasn't.   3. The decor in that place is tacky, just awful. And the uniforms of the waiters boarders on bizarre. Whoever styled that restaurant has all they style and class of one of the local Las Vegas hookers.",

The waitstaff is on-point. They're quick with drinks, friendly, super-high-energy, well-dressed, well-versed on the menu, quick to offer suggestions, and they just go above and beyond to cater to your needs.  The atmosphere is great. It's a perfect setting as a pub. It didn't seem as loud as other reviewers were complaining about.  Where this place is lacking (and I'm so surprised I'm saying this) was the food. I had the fish and chips. While I appreciated the nod toward Gordon Ramsay's heritage, there's really nothing authentic about the dish aside from the minted mushy peas. They tasted just like my grandma's peas (Which led to an awkward conversation with my dining companion when I accidentally let it slip that they tasted like \"her peas\").  The fish and chips weren't really like anything I've had in England. The batter was soggy inside/under-cooked, and the chips were potato wedges, also undercooked... And completely bland. They hadn't seen a bit of salt.  Other things we tried were excellent, though. The pretzels were great. And the sticky toffee pudding may have been the best thing I've ever put in my mouth in my entire life.  Maybe we just got a bad batch for our entrees, but I kind of hold this restaurant to a higher standard than most. Unfair? Maybe. But it could have been better.",

    "text": "Modern but relaxing pub that features elevated British pub food in a comfortable and lively setting showing sporting events from across the world.The centerpiece of the restaurant is a striking bar with an array of beer taps and a backdrop reminiscent of iconic British telephone booths.  Went with a large group and we enjoyed every single dish we tried: deviled eggs, English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, a selection of sausages, fish and chips, pub burger, butternut squash soup, pork and duck rillettes, beef check sandwich and their roasted jidori chicken. All dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked - truly can't decide what we loved the best (although I have to admit, these were some of the best fish and chips and shepherds pie I've had to to date).  It was also relatively affordable (although make sure you have the Caesar's rewards card to get the better pricing on the menu). Our waitress was attentive and courteous.  We will surely be going back.",

The prices are high.. first thing you notice. I got a Shepherd's pie just because it was the least expensive on the menu. ($23)  I had spent a lot of money throughout the night, I didn't want to over spend here too. The servers outfits were soo cool. I loved the chains and pants. They had a rock star look to them.   My server was attentive. I was just finishing up my water, when she stood by waiting until I put it down on the table and right away filled it up! lol. She was not leaving my glass empty. My food was fast and hot. It looks small but once you start digging in, you notice it's more than it looks. It was really good. The meat was juicy and the potatoes had just the right amount of flavor. I was pleased with my dinner.   So for my Pie and tip came to $29 bucks.",

Our wait staff was not friendly and made it seem like they had better things to do than to wait on us.     We started with a scotch egg which had great flavor but the egg yolk was hard rather than runny.  My wife ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and the chicken was super dry... If it was Hell's Kitchen I think GR would have thrown the whole plate at a garbage bin across the room.   I ordered the fish and chips... And was awarded with two very small pieces of fish and very soggy fries.   The tartar sauce was really good though.  The best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding....   We don't mind paying more $$$ for great food, but I felt like we wasted a lot of money here on mediocre food and poor service.  I hope they were just having an off night.",

    "text": "Went as party of three, seated for about 10 mins with no water nor menu, we decided to call the waiter and see what the deal was since the place wasn't that pack. Waiter came up to us with nerves and indescribable expressing in his face, right away he handed us the touch pad menu(drink) and the rest of the menu and said that he was really sorry for the wait around here. It's alright we said, and let him started the explanation for the menu.  We soon decided to order the Shepard pie, braised beef(forgot the full name) and lamb burger(medium with goat cheese). Check around the drink menu I then decided to have a glass of organic apple cider to go with my lamb burger, which turned out to be a perfect pair. Friend ordered the pear cider and was pretty good as well, for $9/glass there were no complains.   After ordering our foods and drinks, my friend noticed that the other tables received their complimentary breads which i thought we have to place an order on but should be giving first thing as seated along with waters, we then call the waiter once again, and he responded to us like he knew exactly what we were going to ask before we even said anything.... that was weird to me, if he knew what we've been waiting, how come we were still seeing tables after tables came in after us getting their breads before we even did. I believe that's when a table got totally left out and poor coordination with the front house. Not to mention there were this suited guy who seemed to be the manager that's warmly welcoming the other tables and have couple eye contacts with me but never crossed his mind that he might want to check on our table and see if there are anything he can help us with.   I've been as a waitress once, I understand the struggle working as one as a start-up and if that's what happened on that day on the guy who served us, I'm more than understandable, but seemed to me, there are really little support by the management around the front house anyway, that's a shame as my first GR's dining experience.  The part with foods were great, all of the orders were wonderful except my lamb burger tasted burned a bit, and it was too dark in the dining room that I wasn't able to identify the surface of the burger before my first bite. As I made my complain to the waiter, he told me this is grilled and can't avoid the burn on top of the surface. I told him I'm fully aware of that but this is just too burned for me to bare. He accepted the plate and turn it back to the kitchen. I have not gotten the order until everyone else finished with their orders, but it was worth the wait, second time's a charmed... I loved everything about that lamb burger and the goat cheese has given the burger even better flavor than it already were.  Shepard pie was satisfying, my boy friend was aiming for this order before we came and was pleased. Braised beef was cooked beautifully and flawless, any more words would be over analyzed.   Overall we've had a great time enjoying ourselves, if only the service can be a little bit more careful. Will return for a second try for sure.",

I had the Shepards pie and thought was delicious as well. They also had a few craft beer selections which is a bonus for me. For dessert we shared the sticky toffee pudding and it was great. The second outing I had a burger that was way better than the burgers at his other restaurant, BURGR. Overall, the food is delicious. The service at our second outing was actually awesome.

For a restaurant with this namesake, I expected a much better experience than what we got, especially if it's going to be $120 lunch. After being seating by the hostess we waited for about 10 minutes for our waiter to greet us. Even then, I'm not sure he would have if he hadn't  noticed my girlfriend grab a glass bottle of water from a nearby bucket to at least start to quench our thirst. Then, when he came over, he stole the bottle of water from us, despite the fact we said we were very thirsty and needed lots of water. He seemed surprised and unprepared that we were ready to order, but took our order. \"We'll start with the mini lobster roll appetizer and then 2 orders of fish & chips please with an iced tea to drink.\" He then disappeared again and about one minute (now they're fast?) later our delicious (5 stars) mini lobster rolls showed up via a stranger, not our waiter and were consumed. Our fish & chips came soon after, also delivered by a different stranger, and while not as good as the appetizer the fish and tartar were good (4 stars) the chips were burnt on the outside and raw inside ( NO STARS ).  The waiter never checked on us and we felt inclined to ask the random people delivering food to us for help, which they did for some things. Even telling the waiter that we wanted to order dessert. \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" (3 stars) and a double espresso (2 stars). Our bill for lunch was about $110 - we left only a $10 tip which I wish the random strangers would get not our absentee server. I had intended on trying Gordon's BurGr restaurant",

I brought my father in law here while our wives were dining elsewhere.  Except for the Calamari which were good, everything else was horrible. The chicken wings were meatless (a vegetarian could have eaten them for all the chicken they had). The prime rib was so tough that my father in law sent his back. I nibbled at enough of mine that I didn't send it back, but you could tell it was old, tough, dog food grade meat.  Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed of himself! His next Kitchen Nightmares should be filmed in his own bloody restaurant!  Not only will we not be back at this establishment, but we are far less likely to go to his other restaurants - just in case they've gone downhill in a similar manner to this one.",

Furnishings are deep chairs and an ad hoc selection of tables and other chair types - none of which are for dining.  The men's room had a latrine 'out of order' ... as well as towels strewn all over the bathroom. It was a bit shocking.  The food is unremarkable at best. The 'most popular dishes' are Shepard's pie and fish and chips. Well golly, who would have thought? I had the pie....served truly scalding hot and more like a school lunch version. I also had a few chips...a bit limp and then lamp heated into a old fry. Dear God in Heaven - somebody either straighten this place out, or close it. Such valuable real estate across from Caesars Colosseum deserves so much better. I will never return, and suggest you don't either. I feel so bad for the many nice people who work there.",

Good luck finding that any where else on the strip (to all you people that are complaining about it being overpriced).   The atmosphere is very very cool! Old British pub style with a hint of the Royal Family and a dab of punk rock. Love that the restaurant has an open facade; Ceasars is such a beautiful casino, it's nice that they embraced that. Cool decor with old barrels, chairs decorated with corgis, painting of bulldogs, etc. brings a nice little bit of England to the strip.  I love the food here. I've ordered many things off the menu, and all were fantastic. My favorite is the Scottish Salmon; it is made to perfection. Their bread service is really interesting as well: comes with an array of different types of bread and sticks and delicious dipping sauces - new twist on an old tradition.   The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because of the rude hostesses at the front. Attn ladies: I understand you work at one of the busiest casinos on the strip, but don't act like you are doing me a favor by taking my reservation. We had to wait at the main entrance for 5 mins before one of them even asked if I had been helped. They were all too busy chatting to each other to attend to the long line of customers.  Also, the table service here can be a little slow as well. We weren't too bothered by that because the food was so awesome.   Book a reservation online before you get here, it does get quite packed.",

A group of 6 of us came in for 1 hour and spent about $170 on three apps and two rounds of drinks.  Delicious Mac & Cheese, French fries and Slider-thingys.

I work in customer service and so I was even more annoyed at how we were treated. I will never go back here, food was average, warm not hot, and nothing special - not worth the price.

We had chosen to save this place for our last dinner before leaving Las Vegas. We ordered the Maine Lobster and Shrimp Roll Minis, NY strip steak dinner, Ribeye steak dinner, mashed potatoes, and Goodbye Blue Sky (one with and one without alcohol) for drinks. The Maine Lobster and Shrimp Roll Minis were absolutely amazing. The Goodbye Blue Sky is the best drink I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were chunky (which is fine), but they lacked flavor. The asparagus stalks were so big they were very tough, and not edible.  I could not believe the steaks, the ribeye had great texture, but zero in the flavor department. The NY steak was not so great texture wise, and it lacked flavor.  I do need to say the server was totally awesome. He immediately brought the manager to our table upon learning of our disappointment.  We only intended to provide feedback for the manager to give the cook, but the manager promptly dismissed the cost of the steaks. He was very apologetic, and kind. He went as far as offering us complimentary dessert, but we didn't feel right accepting his offer.  The effort to make things right with us was above and beyond, but the food was a big disappointment.",

The burger was rare and quite pink.   WTF?  This is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant without anal retentive attention to detail.  Uneffing believable.    And the waiter had a bad attitude.  He obviously didn't want to be there (understandable), however, professionalism is required in every sales industry.  High level customer service delivery is key to stay in business.  That's 2x #GordonRamsayFail in 1 visit.   A completely destroyed first impression.   Positive points: the manager on duty took the poorly prepared food off our bill, offered to make our meal right and a free dessert.  We declined a second food prep and the dessert.   The lobster Mac & Cheese is delicious.   Will I go back?  No.  There is awesome mac and cheese everywhere these days.",

I was looking for a relaxed atmosphere to just unwind with a beer in casual attire and happened to walk by this place. There was so much I enjoyed about this place, but let me highlight the one thing that really irritated me about this establishment. The hostesses wear the most hideous dresses! So try not to mind the outfits, you may lose your appetite.  Instead of the beer, I ordered the \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" - so sweet and refreshing and crisp! I also got the soft pretzels, which were how you'd expect soft pretzels to be, and a burger. The service and the drink really gave this place four stars - he constantly checked up on us and helped us charge it to our room in Paris when someone at the concierge made a mistake on the name of the room.  The burger was really dry so minus .5 stars and the hostesses outfits were nauseating so minus another .5 stars. Other than those two things, I can't wait to go back!  *Beijing Noodle No. 9 - c'mon really? Upscale noodles? No no, just upscale price.",

After waiting 30-minutes for a table of 7, we were ushered to a table with bar stools! They were cushioned, but when I sat down I sunk into the stool and felt like a toddler in a high chair. The first thing I noticed on the menu were the prices! Holy cow! Very pricey! The 2nd thing I noticed was the menu was limited. I decided to just drink water and my hubby and I split a 14oz steak for $38. It came with asparagus.. That's it! No salad. No soup. I can get a way better meal for the same amount at Berns Steak house here in Tampa. But this is Vegas. We ended up ordering the cheesy cauliflower also. As for the taste, the steak was quite tasty and I did enjoy it. The asparagus was average and the cauliflower was tasty.  Would I come here again? Maybe if I was going to watch a sporting event for drinks and split an appetizer but there are too many other choices in Vegas.",

We got seated at a high top with backless seats. Normally I prefer bar seating but when you have dinner reservations I prefer a table. Or at very least a seat with a back. To me it shouted \"eat your food and get out\".   Food is ok. Definitely not worth the price. We had a filet, Shephard's Pie, Steak and Ale pie, corned beef, truffle fries (Gordon Ramsay - didn't you say something about truffle oil being one of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef?),  and wings. Everything was edible but would not draw me back.  For this one, yelp is spot on - 3 stars. Don't waste your time and money here unless it's the only place that can seat you.",

I bumped up the rating to be more than 3 stars because the staff and service was really good, and we had fun talking to others at the bar next to us.  Will probably skip this place next time.

I know that this is a celebrity chef owned establishment on the Strip, but almost $150 before tip for the above mentioned meal (oh, and two beers and one cocktail)?  I mean come on, you can get basically the same thing at many other on-strip pubs for half the price. If the food was exceptional, the price may be justified.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

    "text": "I always keep an open mind when trying a new place. Especially having tried Gordon Ramsay Steak and loving it. With that said we were greeted by a cute chatty hostess to show us to our table. I liked the staffs outfits, dark wood decor and barrels stacked to create a wall between the bar and restaurant but I hated our table. The location was fine, but it was a high top with backless stools, I felt like a little kid and never felt comfortable. Request a booth, they look so comfy. We got food menus right away but had to wait for the drink menu, they brought us some water ( which wasn't the tastiest tap water) while we passed the one drink menu iPad around deciding what to drink. Doug was the only one getting a specialty cocktail, the Pub Crawl. It was light and tasty, I'd recommend it, he ended up getting a second one later.  I had my heart set on a Scotch Egg but I noticed it wasn't on the menu, once we finally made our minds up on food I asked our waiter about the Scotch Egg, he said it's on the pub menu and offered to get us one. We waited and waited, when he finally came back, he asked if we were ready to order,  again I asked about the pub menu, he apologized and got us one within a minute. He seemed to discourage us from most things on the pub menu, not sure why? But I ended up getting the Scotch Egg which was very disappointing, it wasn't greasy, had a nice crunch but the sausage was dry and very spicy which overwhelmed the egg and I didn't care for dipping it in the hp sauce. I had one at another gastropub in town and it was tremendously better than Gordon's.  We had also received their free bread service which included 3 different pretzel bites and a rye roll with pots of butter and cheese. Having 4 people at our table I think we should've gotten 2 but we all shared so we could have a bit of everything. They were all very good, I would order it if it wasn't complimentary. One thing we thought was strange was we didn't get bread plates to eat our bread or share the apps. Very messy. When ordering our entrees, Doug was unsure on what to get and tried to get some help from the waiter, but it was one of those scenarios where they say everything is good but push the most expensive choice, not very helpful. Our entrees came not too long after our apps and bread. Crowding our already small table, they never removed the Scotch Egg dish. There was a Pork Belly Roll, the Lamb T-Bone, and 2 of us got the Fish and Chips. We sampled each dish. The Pork belly was very moist and tender but it didn't have much else going on. The lamb was okay but nothing special, I didn't taste any of the mint jus that was suppose to be present, the mustard on the side was strong with horseradish but it was good. The Fish was tender and not greasy with a decent crunch but it wasn't anything special either, I've had better fish and chips at an English pub in town. The \"chips\" were way too big, not crispy at all, I didn't like them. The mushy peas were really nice and fresh tasting though. I couldn't finish one of fish pieces so asked for it to packed up, I think in higher end places the waiter should box it for you, but maybe that's just me. I had to box it myself.   We couldn't leave with out getting the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. It was really good. Sweet, moist, gooey, some crispy spots all with a side of sweet cream ice cream. Yum. Thus far my impression was poor service, don't waste your time on an entree here (IMO go to his steakhouse instead), seems like a good spot for drinks, small bites/apps, and dessert. I have to say they were nice enough to allow us to hang out for awhile after dinner, they warned us they were closing for a private event so the place cleared out fast around us but let us stay til the last minute before they had to have everything ready. We were also well supplied with water, even though we had already paid and tipped.   For the prices and name on the door, I was disappointed. Gordon, say it ain't so!",

We had a terrible experience in  Giadas resturant in vegas but Randall made me, my wife and my wifes brother and his wife made up for it.  He helped me by recommending different options and choices on the menu as well as making us feel at home {my new home away from home}. The food was delicious as well as the service. We were there last Wednesday. Both Mr. Goldrich's professionalism and caring made up for what would have been a forgettable night.Being a fellow New Yorker he tried and succeeded This will definitely be a regular stop on my trips to LasVegas",

    "text": "Sometimes the greatest triumphs are born from disasters, and our visit to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesars Palace was no exception. This review's a bit long, but trust me, it really hits its stride around paragraph eight.  My girlfriend and I wandered into the restaurant on Saturday, March 7th, lured in by a sign at the entrance advertising some pretty appealing happy hour deals. The deals were so enticing that we failed to notice the not-so-fine print indicating happy hour only occurred M-F. Oh well.   We approached the host stand and were immediately greeted warmly by Randy Goldich, who we came to find out later is Bar Manager for GRP&G. Randy was a great host and was incredibly accommodating upon learning that my girlfriend was not only vegetarian, but also allergic to wheat. He brought us a gluten-free menu and even gave us happy hour pricing on our Angry Orchard cider/Fireball shot combos (also known as Angry Balls...you gotta try). And that's where things started to fall apart...  I ordered the fish and chips, and the GF ordered the vegetarian blah blah whatever sandwich with gluten free bread. The food didn't arrive until the Angry Balls had already done a number on us, so we were ravenous. As I stuffed my face with fish I couldn't help but notice that my GF's gluten-free bread looked remarkably like...bread. We called our waitress Nini over, and she was incredibly apologetic and immediately took the sandwich back to the kitchen.  As we waited for the sandwich to be fixed, two more ciders were mistakenly delivered to our table (not a complaint), and suddenly it felt like we were in a rotating restaurant. But boy did we make friends with all the staff! We met waiter Marvin, who recently won Caesars employee of the year, and yukked it up with Tom Tom (or was it Ray Ray?), their award winning mixologist. We were practically falling off our stools by the time the replacement sandwich came, but it finally did: a beautiful vegetarian, gluten-free sandwich wrapped in lettuce and filled with...chicken.  By this time I was forced to relinquish my own hand-cut fries (apparently they call them \"chips\" in Vegas) due to the girlfriend's voracious state, and the potatoes did a good enough job of soaking up the fermented apple juice that we were ready to call it an afternoon. Randy was apparently tied up in the kitchen, so manager Michelle came by the table and let us know that our meal was free. She also sent us off with the correct order in a to-go container, 2 1/2 hours after we had initially arrived for a light lunch.  Less than an hour after leaving the restaurant, I received a call on my cell phone from Randy, who apologized profusely and invited us back for dinner the following night as his guests. I was initially shocked as to how Randy had gotten my number, but then the GF reminded me of my tendency to hand out business cards to everyone I talk to after imbibing a few cocktails.  To say we were shocked at his offer would be an understatement. We're not high-rollers; we're not even the lint in Dean Martin's belly button. But if there was anything that we learned after chatting with our boy Randy, it's that the man takes a genuine vested interest in his customers' happiness. It's not about Yelp reviews or who can tip the most; it's about making every guest feel like they had a remarkable experience. It's an old-school approach to service and building customer relationships that seems to be lost on so many that work in hospitality nowadays. So obviously, we took him up on his offer for dinner.  We returned at 9:30 the following evening and came to figure out that even though Randy's scheduled shift had ended several hours earlier, he made it a point to stay until we were seated and served the meals we ordered. He put us under the tender loving care of waiter Roger, and introduced us to season 12 winner of Hell's Kitchen Scott Commings, who can whip up a meatless wedge salad like you wouldn't believe. Even after we declined dessert, Roger still brought us every single gluten-free dessert option on the menu! It turns out that vanilla ice cream was really the only option that fit the criteria, but we were impressed nonetheless.  After two experiences in two days with GRP&G, I was left with two very distinct lasting impressions: 1) Randy Goldich is a pretty incredible guy, and he and his staff will apparently do whatever it takes to make their guests happy, and 2) this is definitely the most awesome thing that has ever come from dating a gluten-free vegetarian. Because of our experience, we actively look forward to visiting Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill next time we visit Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We loved it! We are Vegas locals and went on a Friday afternoon because we wanted to see if we liked this as much as BurGR. I ordered the onion soup and the shepherds pie and my boyfriend ordered the burger and fries. Both of us kept eating way after we were full just because it was so good. The service was fast, really friendly, and helpful with recommendations. The decor is hip and comfortable, and there was no wait at all on the last weekend before Christmas, which was a plus.  The only cons in my opinion were 1) the price of beer, which is typical of restaurants in the casinos on the strip and 2) being seated right beside other patrons lacked privacy and was not seemingly necessary.  I think this restaurant is a great example of what sets an expert like Gordon Ramsay apart from the rest. Everything was clean, organized, friendly, simple to understand, food was made very well, and the experience left us wanting to come back with friends.",

I'll just get my one complaint out of the way first: we looked at the menu online on their website for caesars and it was very different from the one we got at the restaurant, the one at the restaurant had way less selection than the one online. Other than that this place was great! The theme is totally perfect with the British pub/ Gordon Ramsay feel and it's great all the way to the servers and hosts outfits and even the silverware is super cute and on theme. The prices were reasonable-ish, I think $24 is a little much for a pot pie but it was delicious! The nachos were also really good, unlike any nachos I've had before because the potato chips were really crisp and fresh and the sweet peppers added a good flavor to it. We also checked in to get the free dessert and it was amazing! Melted in my mouth sooooo good! And last but not at all least our server, Christopher Lee (like count dooku! ) was so great! Very personable, easy going and fun to talk to!! He definitely added a lot to our experience!",

    "text": "I have now been to the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill twice; once on New Years Eve and then again yesterday. My party and I were satisfied on NYE. The waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was incredible. However, my visit yesterday was mediocre at best. We had to ask twice to get out free pretzel/bread basket and it wasn't delivered until well after we received our entrees. Also, the food was not all delivered at the same time. I ordered the fish and chips, which you would think was the fastest to make (compared to the lamb and sliders), but I had to wait three or four minutes for my dish after the others were delivered. There were no complaints about the food, but we felt neglected.  Tips: - Make sure to make reservations on Open Table before hand - If you have Total Rewards make sure to check the TR prices are charged on your bill. Both times I visited full price was charged. They also don't accept Ceasers TR F&B vouchers. - I made the mistake of taking my parents here. The music was very loud, which I don't mind. However, it was difficult for my older parents to hear. - As with most upscale restaurants, unless specified (eg Fish and Chips), the entrees don't include any sides. You have to order them separately.",

We had a reservation for 6pm on Wednesday but on arrival had to stand in line with people without reservations and had to wait to be seated by one of the 3 greeters.......these were young women who seemed to enjoy social chatter between themselves rather than helping the customer Our waiter was average and showed no interest in the fact we were returning customers. Our fish and chips arrived quickly, but as mentioned by others the fish was soggy (certainly no where close to crispy batter) and the chips were similar...portions seemed smaller than before and the food served was simply unacceptable for the cost. we only drank soda and as a result our waiter vanished and only returned with the bill. In my opinion the restaurant was not clean and my wife was surprised ( not in a good way) to find the ladies bathroom out of order we will not be returning but do rec you try Burgr ( That's how it's spelt) for a good GR experience.....this is vastly superior in every area and surprisingly cheaper....a winning combination for us",

When we walked by the Pub and Grill at Caesar's Palace, we knew we would return and we did.  We ended up walking back when the restaurant was open for Happy Hour.  That was lucky for us.   The nachos were very different than what you'd expect to receive at a Mexican restaurant.  After all, they should be because this is a Pub.  They were delicious as were the 3oz sliders we ordered from the regular menu.    Not only was the food excellent but so was the service.  Our special treat was a visit to our table from Scott.  He actually took time out of his busy schedule to chat a bit.  What a great restaurant and great experience it was.  Would we return?  Most definitely!",

We were not disappointed at all. The fish was hot, flaky, crunchy deliciousness. The sauce wasn't overly sweet & the chips weren't greasy & had the skins on which I personally love. My only wish would be that they offered other sauces for dipping the fries (but it's not traditional I know). The decor was a modern funky pub like atmosphere. The staffs uniforms were fun too. The staff was very helpful & entertaining. They are all having a good time & it translates to the guests. I would recommend this to anyone seeking proper fish & chips or just a good time.",

I got the beer braised rib with creamy barry risotto.. the risotto was the only decent part of this dish... other friends in my group got salads, burgers, and steak but no one seemed happily satisfied with any of their dishes.  Just Pricey Pub Food with no flair or special touches.",

My family was delighted to dine at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant due to the amazing food and Roger's kind attendance to our table's inquiries and requests. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made my family (whom are visiting from out of town) feel right at home. The restaurant was bustling with people enjoying their food and having a good time. Roger has made our experience at the restaurant a warm and welcoming one. We always tell our friends and family how delicious the food is. We will surely return!",

The service here is amazing. They are always on top of everything you need. Once, they could tell that we were not happy sitting at the high tops and they quickly moved us to a more comfortable area. Whether it is super busy or dead, they will take care of you.   Some things to try if you have never been here are the Kettle chip nachos, Fish and Chips, and their burgers. The corned beef on the kettle chip nachos is so tasty and cooked perfectly. It's hard not to want to eat so many before your meal comes out but you do want to make room for the Fish and Chips! Best Fish and Chips I have ever had in my life!! The cod was super fresh and perfectly breaded; not greasy at all. The tarter sauce that comes with it is amazing too. Their burgers are amazing too! Maybe even better than the ones they serve at Gordon Ramsay Burger. The meat was super juicy and flavorful.",

We decided to start with the deviled eggs and am glad that we did. They are really creamy with nice spice. I will say that I think the are overpriced due to the fact that you only get a few for the price.  I had the fish and chips as I see it on hells kitchen all the time and wanted to try it. It really is delicious.  My partner had a burger and said it was amazing and the bun was really great.   The food runners are great and really attentive as the servers are so busy taking orders.  I think the prices are a bit steep but you are paying for the name and location.   The space is beautiful and has a great pub feel.  We never saw Gordon or got to hear him call some one a \" donkey\" but had a good time anyway. I deducted one star due to the wait time and feeling a bit rushed after the meal. I know they had people waiting but felt they really wanted your seats right away. Maybe it was because it was a weekend.   If you have the money and time, give it a try.",

After the first hour of asking for him 3 times just to order drinks, we somehow received a bread basket 1.5 hours later 2 minutes prior to the meal. Never saw our server again... Not for a napkin, not to check in, not for more drinks, and not even to see if we wanted dessert in celebration of my friends birthday. He simply dropped the bill on the table and walked away. As a local- even just as a patron, the service was appalling. On our way out, my friend appropriately made a comment to the hostess in hopes that management would be made aware to which he was given the response \"I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do.\"  Waste of time money space and unfortunately a special occasion. Gordon Ramsay may be a good chef, but his business sense is absolutely pathetic.  Mr Ramsay, you've been CHOPPED!",

Wish I would've ordered my own (sticky toffee pudding), instead of sharing. Lol. Lots and lots of beer on tap, although we didn't have any. Fish & chips too pricey at $30-I just got the fish & chip sandwich at burgr instead. ($16 Very good, but standard). Interesting appetizers but some entrees too fancy for my taste.

The split pea soup was stellar.  Thick, big chunks of ham...but only a piece of bread (which was really good, though) to go with it.  Would have preferred saltines (it's a pub, right?).  For entrees, wife had the fish and chips which was really good, crispy, hot, nice chunks of fish.  Only issue:  asked for \"regular\" ketchup,for the fries and the waitress said they don't have regular, they add horseradish to it.  Really?  Can't come up off a bottle of ketchup? I had the shepherds pie, which was also really good.  But it was unbelievably hot (oven hot).  Came in a clay pot which maintained the heat.  A little over the top hot.  I have to say, it seems Gordon Ramsey caved to Vegas pressure and made everything overpriced (like almost everything else in Vegas) at least it sure wasn't the prices one would expect for pub food (especially if you've ever been to a pub in England, the difference is huge!)  No salt and pepper on the table.  That's just pretentious.  Bottom line:  good food, loud restaurant, good people watching, way more expensive than it should have been.",

So first off there wasn't any room to seat us, apparently most people make a reservation, but it was nice that the girl said she would text us so we could go play the slots while we wait, and I did get a text about 10 minutes later.  We ordered the lobster roll appetizer, it came as one thing, and we asked the waiter to split it and he didn't cut if very well, so it was really hard to share. None of the appetizers looked good for sharing, except the calamari, but i've had enough calamari this year.  So I ordered the lamb burger, kind of a long wait to get the food. We took pictures with the British background while we waited and posted on facebook. It was nice for social media purposes, I guess. We had the bad luck of ending up with a wobbly table and it ended up shaking and spilling water everywhere and the cloth napkins were water-resistant so it was hard to clean up.   The burger itself was pretty good, although it was strange that I couldn't tell if it was beef or lamb- i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. The cheese on the burger was good and the fries were good. My boyfriend got the salmon, which was good as well.  Overall, the food is good, but the restaurant itself has some issues with tables and service.",

Waitstaff in general is standoffish and tends to gather around and talk in a corner (albeit not loudly).   TL;DR - Food was great; Service could have been better.

For beer I ordered the Innis and gunn...the bartender asks me after I ordered. \"now that's a \"pale\" ale....is that gonna be ok??\" don't talk to me like that... If I order something why would u question me...? Like it felt like he was saying that cuz I was a girl... Whatever.. The beer was awesome and not even hoppy at all which seemed to be what he was implying by his question. I actually went back the next day to the bar to order the same beer again cuz it was so great ... The 2nd bartender when I ordered said \"have you had the pale ale variety? That is what we have on tap right now\" which was a nicer way of asking without being presumptuous.  Anyway. For an Anglophile like me, I love this place. Reminds me of England and love the British music that plays (queen, the kooks, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic monkeys etc..)  Would like to return for more Innis and Gunn as well as the famous sticky toffee pudding which I was too full to order :(.",

    "text": "Took my brother in law here for dinner because he is a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. We made reservations, asked to be by the kitchen, and also mentioned it was a birthday dinner. They didn't relay any of that information when it came time to dine but at least they had our reservation on file.   Service was awful during our visit. My brother in law ordered the Onion soup and they brought it out to him without a spoon. We had to flag down our waiter and ask for the spoon. They were also \"conveniently\" out of their house wine so we were forced to spend more money on wine with dinner.   When it came time for the bill we had to wait about 10 minutes for him to bring it.   If Gordon Ramsay knew how terrible the service was at this place he might make a visit and set them straight. At no point should the waiter tell me that $17 calamari is justified no matter the quality because we are in Caesars Palace. To be fair, the calamari was decent.   I am only giving 2 stars because of the terrible service. The food was good, not great. I can get better at my local pub for a lot less money.",

    "text": "I'm not much of a Ramsay fan outside of him trashing Amy's Baking Company on the infamous episode of Kitchen Nightmare, but one co-worker I was with on my recent Vegas lives for Ramsay.  She wanted to go to the Pub, BurgR, the Steakhouse, and any other taco stand or dumpling house he might open next week.  I think I can best sum up the experience with a what I liked vs what I didn't like list:  I liked that is was not a stuffy restaurant.  The atmosphere and decor was fun and inviting. I liked the non traditional table I was at with 2 large, cushy chairs on one side, and a couch on the other (you might not like this) I liked the huge beer list. I really liked my lamb chops.  The food got high marks by everyone at the table for quality and prep.  I did not like the drink list on the ipad.  It did lead to some great conversation about if we though we could get away with stealing the Ipad...but, with 4 of us at the table, and only 1 Ipad, it was a rush job to look thru the 100+ beers separate onto different web pages by category.  In the interest of time, I just picked an old, well known favorite vs. something rare or reading up and trying something new.  ...and finally, what killed the experience...the serving size.  Upon looking at all the dinners as they came out, my initial though was, 'they know we did not order of the kiddie menu, right?'  While my lamb chops were great, there was only 4 lil chops for a serious price.  By contrast, Firefly, a well known local tapas restaurant, offers a $10 tapas plate with 2-3 pieces, and while maybe not as awesomely seasoned, it's still very good over there.  My Irish buddy got the Sheppards pie, and while he admitted it might be better than what momma made him...the size of it was seriously laughable.  I was not surprised when I heard he picked up more to eat.  As for that drink Ipad...Our best idea was to list it on Craigslist and sell it for cheap for immediate cash only, with an exchange in the bathroom, and quickly paying the tab in cash...and defiantly not returning to Caesars on this trip.  I'm just saying, if you ever see it on craigslist, don't go buy an Ipad from a guy in the mens room of Ramsay's Pub & Grill, it might some other guy with a clever but flawed idea.",

I knew I wanted to come to Caesar's to play some craps that night so wanted to kill two birds with one stone. I was actually surprised at the beer selection and service. Sure the waiters wear some downright weird outfits, but were attentive and very nice. We both got the fish and chips and an Innis & Gunn. The fish was a little on the salty side but was actually pretty good. The chips could have been a little crispier, but again were better than expected. With the prices and all of the restaurants in Vegas I likely won't return, but was pleasantly surprised.  I added a star for the bread basket that came out before our meals. It was stocked with soft pretzel rods, cheese dip, and a few other items and was pretty freakin awesome. It was perfect with our beers and would make an awesome appetizer with a few beers at the bar!",

    "text": "A yummy late night dinner!  Arrived here last night at approximately 9:20pm and was told the wait was 35 minutes for a table.  We gave the waitress our cell phone number and she said she would text us once our table was ready... 50 minutes later, we were seated at our table.  The hostess was rude - hardly looked me in the eye, never smiled, and was completely miserable.  - I'm sure Gordon Ramsey would have thrown a few F-bombs.   My four stars is given to the Traditional Shepard's Pie.  Ohhh baby, it's GOOD.  It's a smaller portion, but don't let that fool you.  This rich, juicy, and savory dish will leave you more than satisfied.  You can tell that the beef in this dish had been marinating in the stock all day.  Needless to say, I ate the entire thing.    You get a little bread basket before your meal that consists of pretzels and a caraway seed roll.  Salted butter and melted cheese are served next to the breads for dipping.    My guest had the fish and chips, which were excellent too.  The \"chips\" were my favorite.  They are large, one inch potato sticks seasoned with parmesan cheese and salt - fried perfectly.  If you get another dish without chips, I recommend getting a side of these to try, you can't find them cooked like this anywhere else.   The dinner was pricey.  Our bill (two entrees and one soda), was $50.00.  This isn't your 'visit-every-week' pub, but it's definitely worth going to - whether a local or a tourist.  I would say, it might be one of the more unique restaurants on the strip, food wise.    BUT, like I stated before, service needs to be improved.  The hostess made me feel as though she didn't want my business, and I didn't feel very welcomed.  Once I sat down, our waiter was nice, but the hostess ruined the initial experience.",

He was arrogant and unconcerned. Three of us ordered the fish and chips. When the meals arrived and we started eating. After the first bite, my wife started making a throaty sound. I looked at her and watched as she pulled a very long blond hair with fish pieces attached from her mouth. Yum!! I looked up and saw our server looking in our direction. He did an immediate \"exit stage right\" to a hallway. A manager came to our table as the waiter exited the room. He apologized and offered a different meal. Well to make a long story short, dinner wasn't the same. Out of their kindness, her meal was removed from the bill. Our server never once apologized!  GORDON, if you run your life criticizing people, get your property's in order first. SO DISAPPOINTED!! By the way, I gave 2 stars just because the manager noticed and my fish was good.

This was just a few feet from there so we decided to try it out since we just ate at Gordon Ramsay's Steak the night before and loved it. The service was great here and the appetizer was delicious (ordered the calamari). For entrees I ordered the bangers and mash and he ordered the fish and chips. Both were the house specials. They were good, nothing special at all though. I've tasted way better fish and chips in SB, SF, Pismo, etc and they weren't $30 like these ones. $30 was a bit ridiculous for fish and chips, but we thought Gordon Ramsay so it must be good. And there was a fish bone in it! Yeah, nothing special at all and portion was so small. My bangers and mash was good, but again, nothing special. I could make something that tasted like that at home for so much cheaper. The dish was $24. Not worth. Aside from that, it took 45 minutes to receive our food. The people next to us who came after us and ordered the fish and chips too got their food like 15 minutes before us. Only thing that was worth was the appetizer. Calamari tasted like bacon. It was delicious. Despite the prices, the server was excellent. I forgot his name but he was attentive. And gave us free sticky toffee bread pudding with ice cream for free for my bf's birthday. It was one of the best desserts I've ever tasted and I'd pay full price for it. Overall, not worth the price. With how much we spent individually we could've just ate at bacchanal and ate as much as we want with many options.",

    "text": "Anyone break their tooth eating the beet salad?  I was there before the Shania Twain concert and ordered the beet salad that took well over 30 minutes to receive and we sat at the bar for faster service. On my second bite, I bit down on something very hard and realized something went very wrong in my mouth. The waiter, Adam, just happened to be looking at me and asking how was our food. I'm shaking by head NO and pulling the salad out of my mouth to see what was in it and found a very hard object like a rock. Then, I realized it had also broken my molar and ran to the bathroom to see the damage. It was so dark, I couldn't tell but touched the area with my finger and the nerve was exposed and sent me a zap through my body with pain. They called the EMT to write up the incident report, but by now the concert was starting in 5 minutes. We ran to the concert with my mouth in pain and came back to the Pub & Grill after the concert to meet with the EMT again to fill out the paperwork. Even the manager said, it was chewing on a rock and we also found many more smaller pieces in the salad. I had to wait until the next morning to get emergency dental care and found out I would need a crown after the temporary fix in Vegas. I ended up in bed all day with a headache, ruined vacation, missed event, and alot of pain, novocaine, and drilling...no fun!   Long story short, I was supposed to hear from Caesar's within 3 days...never happened! I called them to find out it had been passed on to CCMSI, a law firm who takes care of their injury claims. I was told they mailed me a letter...never got it. I was told they emailed me...never got it until I called again. They never ever asked me for any information or details of the incidence except the simple form of what happened that night and my 2 dental bills. The manager had indicated to keep track of my auto expenses to and from dentist...they had no idea and never asked how much this affected my life. After not hearing from them again for weeks, I kept calling. Finally, two weeks ago the assistant got back on the phone and informed me the supervisor decided they were not honoring the claim because they didn't consider the nut shell or whatever it was to be a \"foreign object.\" I was shocked!!!  All I could think of was if Gordon Ramsay was filming a Hell's Kitchen episode and during the tasting time of judging personally ate the \"foreign object\", broke his tooth off, and swallowed a piece of his molar, would that be acceptable? I've also reached out to his company in London to NO AVAIL with an email to his press department and a message to his facebook page. They have no other email for coorespondence, except to call a London phone number.   After I called Caesar's again to let them know CCMSI had denied the claim, they offered to just pay my two dental bills for my broken tooth. Really? How about the  lost 4 days of my life, lost work, lost vacation, novocaine-drilling-crown for the rest of my life, auto expenses, not to mention all the pain and time it's taken to deal with CCMSI who has not represented Caesar's well at all. Here's the icing on the cake...there's another review in July, 5 weeks after my incident, with the same report of a shell or foreign object in the beet salad at Pub & Grill and he thought it cracked his tooth, but didn't. He even posted a pic with his review of the \"foreign object\". You would have thought the rock-like nutshell or whatever it is, would have been taken care of when it happened to me in such a big way. Obviously it hasn't. Now I'm talking with an attorney to get this resolved and I'm not a sue-happy person. Please message me if you've had a similar experience.  Gordon, as a business owner also, if you don't know about this, you should! Your name, personal reputation, Hell's Kitchen, and Food Network's reputation is on the line!! This was my experience from Hell and I wasn't even in the Kitchen!!!",

It took about 35 minutes for our food to come out and the waitress only checked on us when we ordered and when the food came out. I had to flag her down several times and it was very annoying to wave like a lunatic to get her attention because she would never make eye contact.   We got the pot pie, steak pie, and salmon. No one in my party was impressed. My pot pie tasted like one I could buy frozen at the grocery.   On the plus side, my smores milkshake was delicious and a good price in comparison to other alcoholic shakes in the area and the bread pudding which was free with check-in was delicious!",

The bacon was cold and probably cooked in a large batch hours earlier. The aioli was plain mayo, ordered on side and tasted it.Tomatoes were not marinated just fresh tomatoes. When I inquired about these two missing items the waiter brought me new tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with chives, really? For all the yelling and tantrums Gordon throws about sh@# food at other establishments he really needs to rescue his own restaurant. My husband had the fish and chips,  their signature dish, nothing special, cold fries greasy fish and no flavor at all. My advise eat in the food court adjacent to the pub and save yourself $100.00. I would have enjoyed losing this money on slots way more.",

I think it's high priced for Fish and chips with the price tag of $30.00 but we are in a casino with a full bar and the famous Gordon Ramsey stamp on everything so it's fitting.

    "text": "Sat 8/6 This Place just gets better and better!  I was meeting friends from San Diego, They wanted a really good place to eat so I recommended Gordon Ramseys!  We've always ate at the bar, but now we had to get a table. I normally opt for a bar spot, since I am a good tipper and bartenders normally take care of my drinks. I was a little nervous because of the a few reviews on poor service, but we had the opposite experience here. ( This is why I don't add much into Negative reviews)  The night before we just had a party that Gordon Ramsey attended, so we were excited for another trip to GRPG!  The place was pretty busy, so I was hoping the service would be good. We were sat down right away in the back and our wait was named Adam. Actually we had two waiters and both their names was Adam.  We got our drinks and started off with the Short rib nachos. These nachos were actually better than the last time I was here and those were off the hook!  I had the Bacon Burger and my wife had the pulled Pork sandwich. My friend had the fish and chips - recommended by Adam.  My bacon Burger came and was well done like I asked. It came with a cone of fries, and to my surprise there was a lot more fries than I expected.  Fish and chips- My friends plate was huge and the fish was very fresh tasting. He is a big seafood eater and was happy with both the taste and the size. He stated the batter was perfect. Not a little fish overwhelmed by 10 pounds of fried batter. These were giant fish pieces.  My wives pulled pork sandwich was actually a little larger than she was expecting. She could only eat half. This plate comes with homemade chips as well. She has tried pulled pork sandwiches at some of the best places in Vegas and rate this the best. She likes it more than the Guy Fieri pulled pork sandwich, which I think is one of the best in Vegas.  Bangers and Mash: which consisted of chicken, beef & pork english sausages w/ mash potatoes, sauerkraut & onion gravy. My friends wife cleared this plate in no time. She ordered it without Sauerkraut (Which is a crime in most states) She stated that this was a very good dish as well and wasn't greasy like some sausages are.  We had a lot of drinks, between the Belgium Margs, Good Bye Blue Sky, Pub Crawl- wow were were feeling good after our meal. Drinks were 15 dollars a pop which is about right for a strip restaurant.   Both Waiters names Adam were great and met our every needs. They let us have a good time and knew the meaning of the service industry! We will be back in Nov for sure!!  Silly Tip that might only interest me: If your getting a to-go box, they are awesome and are like little Tupperware boxes. Can be easily reused :)",

    "text": "For fear of being scolded by Mr. Ramsay I will avoid any negatives. Maybe.   I just got done attending a function at Caesars and was craving a burger, I'm talking pregnancy cravings here, enter Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. I sat in the bar area was immediately greeted by a server who fired off the specials and took my drink order. I went looking for the burgers on the pub menu and very surprised when I saw that there are only four burgers offered. I'm assuming he keeps the rest of these juicy treats at his other place.   On recommendation from the server I went the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This spicy slab of beef comes topped with Ghost Pepper cheese, pickled jalapenos, avocado and a smoked tomato aioli. I love spice, flavor spice, not the \"light your hair on fire\", but the responsible and reserved use of heat when cooking. This burger was all that and more, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink and very juicy, so very food porny. The ghost pepper cheese had a slow burn and after a while it began to take hold, but not enough for me to stop. The smoked tomato aioli, pickled jalapenos and avocado were a flavor bomb of happiness that helped cool down my mouth with each bite. Seriously, call me a burger whore because I was all over this thing.   The fries were good, but basic and I didn't really finish them, but the burger portion size was plenty big and filled me up fairly quick. The main thing that did bother me was my seat, I felt I was sinking the whole time and had to keep adjusting my seat and/or style of sitting. This was a minor thing, but after a while it became annoying. I would have probably ordered another drink and allowed my food to settle, but I just couldn't get comfortable.    $22 for a burger? I'm not surprised you ballsy MOFO, but I'm even more surprised you could back it up.",

Well, place was busy so just waited patiently. It's fine.  Food came out in about 30 minutes. Not bad.   I ordered the Hells  burger: well, meh. Kinda bland. Meat was juicy but unfortunately flavor-less (is that even a word?) The fries were kinda chewy. Wasn't sure if I should be happy or sad. Was it meant to be??? McDonalds fries are crispy or crunchy. My wife liked the chewy fries. I found it ok.  Son and wife ordered the soft shell crab sandwich. That was GOOD. I finished my wife's sandwich. No left overs here.  Expected to be WOWED at least.  I'd say I'm a bit underwhelmed. Willing to give it another shot next time.",

I ordered the butter chicken, I watched Gordon's video of it and I thought man that looks amazing. However, here it lacked flavor. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and fresh. However the sauce itself was bland, the rice was however cooked well and they did a great job with it. The truffle fries came out cold, we mentioned this to our server and it was changed promptly. The food was brought out in a reasonable time. The desert however omg, it was amazing! The toffee pudding? Cake? Toffee something! It was just mind blowing. The ice cream pairs really well with the warm Desert.",

Oir server was very prompt and gladly recommended dishes. I ordered the butter chicken curry. The pulled chicken was a bit spicy and came with doughy naan and jasmine rice... a perfect amount of each. Definitely would recommend this one. Tre truffle fries were also really good and came with two types of dipping sauce. The others in the group enjoyed the lobster roles and shepherd's Pie... all tasty and fairly large portions.   Overall I would recommend if searching for a lower key restaurant in the area.",

I couldn't help but wonder how well they could possible clean that wooden platter? The burger was just okay and the fries were just warm - not close to hot. Ramsay would probably have thrown the fries at the waiter. The place feels really dingy, just not clean. The leather-like placemats were quite shabby and well past their prime. The place is adjacent to the slot machines, with no glass to separate you from the smell of stale, smoky air. Overall, a major disappointment not worthy of the Ramsay name.",

So we were seated and a gentleman brought us waters. It's kind of dim inside. We proceeded to order:  Truffle Fries - $12 Nachos - $16 Butter Chicken Curry - $28 Fish & Chips - $30 Prime Rib (Special of the Night) - $55  The prime rib's flavor and texture were very good. I don't think they offer it all the time since it was a special. I also enjoyed the truffle fries and nachos smothered in short ribs, cheddar cheese & sour cream. The chicken curry seasoning was a bit strong for me and the fish&chips were alright. Kind of pricey for 2 pieces of fish but then again it is Vegas. Overall, good food & service.",

We had to have one last go round here at the Pub and Grill for some signature Ramsay fare before we headed to the airport.   We were nothing but satisfied in our sequel venture. Our waiter Rodney was extremely helpful and added his own flair and input to the experience. He made us feel incredibly welcome and at home at our favorite eatery in Vegas.   Thank you to all the staff for the incredible food and we would be more than willing to hop back on the plane just for the Sticky Toffee Pudding!",

This dining experience was during Memorial Day Weekend.  What I did expect was that prices would be high, they were but for a fine dining experience they were typical of a Vegas restaurant. We had the crisp pork belly and brussel sprouts for appetizers. They were both pretty good.  The lamb shank I had for the main course was good and massive, I had a hard time finishing the meal. Eating the lamb shank by itself can become a bit bland, definitely need a light side to go with it.  Service was a little slow, the server seemed tired. It was Memorial day weekend so I understand how busy it can get.",

The bartender was quick to take my order and the wait staff were very friendly and appeared very much into providing a great experience.  I ordered the squash soup and it was serviceable but that's as much as I can say for it. It lacked the complexity I've had with squash soup at Mesa, Paley's Place, etc. Just a dollop of sour cream on top and served with garlic bread, so any crunch and extra flavor came from the bread.  I was truly looking forward to the sticky toffee pudding, as I LOVE sticky toffee pudding. The pudding part was perfect, a lovely dense cake. But the \"toffee\" lacked much flavor other than being sweet. I'm used to the toffee being much more, er, toffee-flavored. Also, the server brought it to me without a spoon and had to go look for one after pouring the toffee syrup over the cake. Ah, well, that will save me lots of calories in the future. If it had been as good as the ones I am used to, I would be dining here every meal while in Vegas. I'm happy others were pleased by it, but for me it was a complete disappointment.  This was my second time at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and both have been disappointing, just lacking in much flavor and everything could use a dash of salt.",

They start you off pretzel bread and some butter and cheese sauce. I didn't love that cheese sauce but bread was good. We ordered the kumamoto to start. Oysters itself were not bad, but definitely could use a better sauce. I ordered the sliders as my entree and the hubs ordered the shepherd's pie. I actually loved my sliders. I thought it was pretty tasty especially with the mayo based sauce. I didn't even ask for ketchup. The shepherd's pie looks small but is a lot of food and quite tasty as well with tender meat and delicious mashed potatoes. We decided to go all out and get dessert. The sticky toffee pudding looked really good in the picture. We were not disappointed. In fact it really made our meal quite enjoyable. Service there was good as well. In fact, Vegas overall provided excellent service.",

The environment was highly inviting and comfortable, a very beautiful modern restaurant with a British flair, not only in the decor but in the menu as well. The staff executed every stage of service flawlessly, with full knowledge of menus items and beverages. The iPad presentation of beverages and deserts added an extra interactive touch to service. The appetizers, bread service, beverages and entrees arrived with impeccable timing and were some of the most beautiful dishes I have seen.

Started out good with super friendly wait staff, but when we had to ask three separate servers for more cocktail sauce we started to get disappointed.  We were going to go see Rod Stewart last night, so were kind of distracted.  The server recommended prime rib since they offer that on show night.  When she said it was market price and $48, I think we really didn't hear that part.   Expecting an enormous slab of meat with lots of potatoes and veggies, we were surprised to get an average size of meat and two small discs of potato along with 8 asparagus sprigs.   Granted it tasted good, but not $48 good.   No salad or soup offered as part of the meal or even bread.  To top it off, our friends ordered Shepard Pie and it was so small we thought it was out mashed potatoes!   They said it was extremely tasteless and were extremely disappointed.  I'm only giving 2 stars because the ambience was nice and the dessert was the best part of the meal.  Oh yea, calamari was just ok.   Not a great impression Chef Ramsey.",

Both items were tasty enough, but they also had issues.   Not that there is a lot of leeway on a small piece of ground meat, but the sliders were medium well or well done. Waitress didn't ask, so I would assume they'd come medium...no such luck. I mentioned this to the waitress, and she replied that she would \"tell the chef\". That was the end of the subject. No offer to take it back and refire, take it off the check or at least apologize. FAIL.   The caesar salad was good, but drowning in dressing. Ordered without the anchovies, and it came with them, as I found out by accident when I ate them. FAIL.   Joined the Caesar's loyalty club to save a couple bucks too, and they didn't apply correct pricing on the check. FAIL. After pointing this out, they finally corrected the bill.  Out the door, $35 for less than a quarter pound of burger with cheese and a caesar dressing salad with lettuce. Pretty embarassing, IMHO.   *Memo to Gordon: This place won't last long, serving mediocre and poorly prepared food. Service and preparation of the food was sadly lacking...basically a disorganized and lacking establishment. Let's just say I'm not eager to bet another $35 that it was just a \"bad day\". Despite this, I'm trying Gordon Ramsay Steak tonight...I PRAY that it's up to snuff. Otherwise, this guy is DONE with Ramsay restaurants. This was a Kitchen Nightmare for sure. Maybe you need to check up on your shops more often!",

    "text": "We visited Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill (inside Caesars Palace) on the first night of a business trip in Vegas.  I was prepared to be unimpressed, but the celebrity stamp on a fairly affordable restaurant specializing in the chef's country of origin was interesting enough to give it a shot. Also, the people I was with wanted to eat there.   I had an Innis & Gunn stout with the black truffle macaroni and cheese, which was EXCELLENT, and I've had macaroni and cheese in a billion places. The Scotch egg and salt and vinegar crisps (calling them that doesn't make them feel any more English than regular potato chips do, but I get it) appetizers were pretty spot-on... not amazing, but good drinking food.   Drink, meal, and tip landed just over $40. Good on you, Gordon Ramsay, for not charging the hell out of people for food that doesn't really justify its price tag. It's sort of a foreign dining experience--I won't call it authentic, but dark, pub-like, with living room-style chairs that were awkwardly low versus the height of the table. Fun and easily satisfying for groups and drinkers.  The service was mediocre that night; our waiter disappeared for long stretches, I had to ask for a water refill; it wasn't the worst service I've had, but it didn't warrant a hefty tip.  A couple days later, we stopped in again (The connected Forum Shoppes made us all tired... from all the shopping) for drinks. The bartender recommended cocktails from the menu, discussed each at length, and was super charming and attentive, even discussing other local restaurant recommendations and letting me sample a bit of a drink I asked about.  If you love English food (and I'm not sure anyone does), this place is doing it right enough to give it a shot.",

There was definitely some excellence, the fish in the fish and chips were amazing, not sure any fried cod is worth $30, but that's just me. The \"chips\" were meh, slightly soggy potato wedges. The Hellfire Lollipop wings were tasty but a little tough skinned, overcooked. Our appetizer fries were tasty. My husband, a huge fan of Gordon, was hoping to have his mind blown by the shepherds pie. He said it was solid, rich, good, not quite amazing. My daughter ordered the Ceasar salad, it was barely mediocre. Something about capers sitting on a romaine leaf is just kind of weird and looked a little like mouse poo. For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding and is was absolutely perfect. Probably one of the best desserts I have ever had. Our service was also great, attentive and friendly. Not sure if we will go again, but if we do I would order the overpriced cod again and definitely the same dessert!",

Oh and both my water glass and my friends were empty thru the dinner and never refilled or asked to be refilled. The waiter was no where to be found and it wasn't even that crowded.

    "text": "This place brought back memories of my very first Elite event. It also brought back a bar set very high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere and everything that you should expect when dining in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  We had a 2pm reservation for fellow Elite Allison's birthday. She went with lunch for the group because it could be quite spendy depending on what you get. Well worth it for a celebration in my opinion.  Between our group we had fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, the pot pie trio, and a couple burgers. Also, deviled eggs, pretzel bread, and Caesar salad for starters. I was lucky enough to try the majority of this stuff, and what stood out the most was: 1. The scallops. Not even a scallop fan but these melted like butter in your mouth. I would think Chef Ramsay was standing over the cook calling him a bloody donkey to make sure they were correct. 2. The lobster mac. HUGE chunks of lobster and a cheese that didn't overtake the flavor, but wasn't too bland either. 3. The deviled eggs. You stuff them yourself, and they have bacon. Need I say more?  Everything was delicious and I would order everything again. That says a lot.  The negatives, not much but they should have complimentary bread. When a burger cost $20-25, you could start with a little something. 2. The service was EH. Our first initial guy Chris, was great. But he left mid lunch and our next guy wasn't nearly as attentive or funny. He did not seem to enjoy his job as much. I wish we had have given the tip to Chris before he bounced, he earned it. The hostess were also a little snooty. Like hello, you are pretty, you're working for a famous chef, and you get to wear a cute dress to work- SMILE it won't hurt.   The positives outweigh the negatives by far which is why this is still a 4 star review. Until next time.",

    "text": "I knew I wanted to eat at a Gordon Ramsay eatery when I went to Vegas. This dude is a beast and I watch most of his shows. So naturally, I would want to try out one of his restaurants. This place happened to be a 30 second walk from the Colosseum, as I was going to see Celine Dion afterwards. So, my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. It's definitely pricier than BurGR over at Planet Holleywood, but not as expensive as Steak.   I would consider myself lucky after reading some reviews that wait time to be seated and for food to come out can be upwards of 60+ minutes. We did not have a reservation for that Friday night at 6 PM, but luckily the wait was just around 25 minutes. It took about 15-25 minutes for our food to come out. I was expecting much longer than that. The couple that sat down next to us waited much longer, though. It was probably about 30-40 minutes. We kept hearing them say \"Why is it taking so long? What's with this hold up? *checks watch every 10 minutes*  The menu here is quite expensive for dishes that seem so simple to make. Lobster mac n' cheese for $25? Yikes. Yes, lobster is expensive, but honestly, I can probably make triple the amount for double the price.   [[Chicken, Kale & Bacon Pot Pie, $23]] For $23, I would expect a huge pot pie. Nope. It came out in this small bowl. I finished the thing in 10 minutes... It was good, yes, but nothing amazing or mind blowing.  [[Grilled Lamb Burger, $21]] My boyfriend ordered this, and he thought it was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The burger came with fries on the side, but $21 isn't worth it.    [[Truffle Chips, $12]] Basically some fries with truffle oil and a sprinkle of cheese on it. The fries itself wasn't too memorable, but the sauce it came with on the side was delicious.   Service here is pretty good; our server was attentive and asked us every so often how everything was going.   Would I dine here again? No. Prices are a tad outrageous (obviously, since it's Vegas, but c'mon now). Even if I was filthy rich I wouldn't. You're just not getting bang for your buck by eating here. You're just paying for the name.",

The decor is nice and I loved the kegs on the walls. It was really unique! Onto the food, it was shit. Absolutely no flavor in anything. My New York steak had no seasonings, not even salt or pepper. The sauce it came with was delicious. It was warm and gave the steak a bit of flavor. Their house steak was just plain weird. My mothers salmon was ok. My sisters burger was the same as the steak, no seasoning. I'm not sure how anyone can leave here feeling happy with their crappy food, and even crappier service. Even the waitress,  who first brought us water, did not even says hello or look us in the eye. Honestly, the whole attitude of the staff seemed like they did not want to be there. Come by, take a picture of the kegs and leave.",

The tarragon tarter sauce was tasty, as was the house made ketchup.  My friend had the Shepard's Pie and he thought it was great.  Overall, I thought it was just an okay meal.

More of a relaxed atmosphere where you just kick back and relax with a drink and unwind.   I came for lunch and was seated right away. Again great service. Very attentive server. Explains to me everything about the pub, and drinks they have as well as the food. Now I'm a big Chef Ramsey fan and I've seen his dishes at the pub on his shows that he did in Europe and I was extremely excited to finally get to try it.   I had his signature Shepard's pie. OMG! Amazing! The beef and lamb stew with the creamy potato layer on top was fantastic. The meet was very very tender and had so much flavor. I also tried his signature fish and chips. By far the best fish and chips I've had! Big tender flaky fish fried to perfection with a light crispy batter. The crunch on the outside was great. The batter was thin and lots of fish on the inside! Amazing! The fries were just as good. Any time you get fresh cut fries it's always good! For dessert again I got his signature sticky toffee pudding. This one is similar to his steak restaurant. Served hot but with out the brown butter ice cream like the the steakhouse restaurant. Came with a vanilla ice cream.   I had an amazing time at all 3 of his restaurants in Vegas. The food is amazing, he really knows his food and it shows. I'm definitely a bigger fan now!",

After a quick wait (~5 minutes), we were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant. Atmosphere was nice, and what you'd expect from a British pub.   Server was very attentive and provided us with some recommendations/customer favorites. We ended up ordering the Calamari to start, which had just a hint of heat and was the highlight of the night. It was a perfect share for our group, as the portion size was quite big.  For entrees, three of us ordered the Butter Chicken Curry as it was pitched as the famous dish there. All I have to say is \"yikes\". The dish came with a very small portion of basmati rice, doughy, disgusting naan and bland chicken. It was incredibly underwhelming, particularly for $28. I can only imagine that if Gordon actually tasted this good himself, he'd soon be scraping it into the garbage.  3 stars for a decent tap list and good service. Butter Chicken is microwave-dinner levels of quality, though.",

Also, the beer I wanted,  Old Speckled Hen was not available, but they did generously charge us for it.  In other news the food was very good. I had the butter chicken curry and enjoyed that very much.  Sara's salmon was fabulous... however the chopped salad while huge was a disappointment,  a lot of lettus and not much else. Very pricy for wasy it was,  but it is Vegas, so there's that.",

The dish is really flavorful, the meat separates when you use a fork to cut the meat into smaller pieces.   The truffle fries are great too, a bit oily but so flavorful! The fries don't taste like cheap truffle oil either.",

My tenderloin was fairly dry and you could tell his ribeye wasn't brought to room temperature before cooking (as Ramsay says to do) because of the coloration in the middle. The garnish of asparagus was cooked to the point of complete mush, and the lobster Mac & cheese was not bad but a little bland. I will say the appetizer mini lobster rolls were great & the best thing we ordered. Our total bill for what I just listed came to $164 before tip - OUCH!! Especially for food that wasn't impressive. I would not come here again.",

    "text": "Here for dinner at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night, July 4th weekend and we were seated immediately.  A square table for four, we sat in our mismatched, padded high back chairs.  All of us sunk.  Me, a 6' foot tall man, having to arch my arms up to grasp a fork and knife.  I felt worse for the girls.  I used to work with interior designers so all I could think of was, \"Who picked out these disfunctional chairs for the restaurant?  Does anyone height check to see that they are suitable to dine in?  Are there some telephone books I can put beneath my bottom so that I can see what's on the table?\"    Very important... There are two menus here.  The full dinner menu and the bar snacks/small bites menu.  No matter where you sit in the restaurant (at the bar or not), you can order from the bar menu.  If your server doesn't hand one to you ask for it.  Some of the dishes over lap, but there are others that don't.    Bread Basket - Good.  There were four different breads, including pretzel bread with bacon bits and caraway seed buns with pumpkin seeds on top. A salted butter and a cheese dipping sauce.    Little Piggy Deviled Eggs - Could definitely taste the bacon in the deviled egg spread.  They serve you four egg whites empty and you fill them yourself with however much deviled egg spread you want.  It wasn't whoa crazy crazy, but everyone enjoyed these.    Fresh Fried Potato Chips with Herbs & French Onion Dip - The potato chips were my favorite food of the night!  Light and crispy, perfect for snacking on.  I could've downed the whole bowl of chips myself, but I opted to share.  I think it's $2 more if you'd like them done Salt & Vinegar style.    Fish and Chips/Cod and Chips - Three generously sized pieces served with mushy peas (mushed peas mixed in with whole peas) and fries.  I liked the peas better than the fries, which is sad because usually the potato always wins with me.  The fries were too soft for my liking.    Pan Seared Diver Scallops - My friend loved and devoured these.  4 large scallops with artichoke hearts, carrots and spring garlic.  A light dish for pub food.   Sheperd's Pie - The other friend said this was okay.  No complaints.    Burger - Was okay.  My friend swapped out her fries for the Smashed Fingerling Potatoes at no extra charge.    Smashed Fingerling Potatoes - Wanna enjoy your meal that much more?  Swap out your fries (or some other side) for this.  The fingerling potatoes have much crunch and flavor than the fries.  Cooked with butter, double cream and black truffle!  Mmmm... the truffle.  So rich but so good!  A few notes and thoughts:  If you don't have one, get your Caesar's Players' Club Card before eating here.  Each dish is discounted $1-2 as long as one person in your party has the free players' card.    The restaurant is pricey considering it's \"only\" pub food.  I know, I'm in Vegas... pay to play.  But $28 fish and chips and a $20 burger?  There was no \"wow\" factor with any of the major dishes.  Food quality overall is not whoa, but it's solid.    They have a good selection of beers, but I thought they'd have more UK beers on tap.  They didn't even have Smithwick's or Harp on tap or in a bottle.    Our server was nice and brought us all that we needed, but it took awhile to track her down a couple of times because she had too many tables to watch.  The restaurant could probably schedule a couple of extra servers on the weekends.    Overall it's 3.5 stars, with price knocking down the rating.  When it's $180 for four people with three of us having one drink each (and no wine), that's pricey for pub food.",

But of course the food is the real star. I ordered the fish and chips that was caught that morning, and it was absolutely divine. We also ordered the mushrooms which we could not get enough of. But then we met the top contender, the famous Toffee Pudding.   The toffee pudding was absolutely to die for, and now tops my list of best desserts I've had in my life, and I'm a total foodie. It isn't really pudding at all, but a toffee cake with ice cream and hot toffee sauce. If you are in Vegas, you need to stop here JUST for this dessert.  The drinks are also incredible! I had the mocha cocktail (?) and it was delicious and worth the price.   Finally, the service. Wow, so incredibly kind. They were so helpful as to walk us through a shortcut to our upcoming show in another casino. Overall they were just so friendly and fun that I would go back just to chat with them one more time.   This restaurant really should not have less than 4.5 stars and that's a minimum. You won't regret your visit!",

    "text": "Located in the beautiful Caesars Palace, Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill is a beautiful and tasty spot that I would definitely recommend visiting!  We were a party of five and we immediately got seated in a beautiful set round table. The whole place has a very British vibe which isn't surprising considering the man who opened it. It felt very comfortable and intimate which I truly loved!  Our server 's name was Sarah and I really have to say she took the experience from a four star to a truly exceptional one! She was knowledgable about both the menu and the specialty drinks. She was so friendly and bubbly and she really went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time and that's something I can't praise enough! She made excellent drink recommendations which I am so glad I took! Because of her I tried the most decadent Strawberry Beer! Something I've never had the pleasure of trying. It was presented in a champagne glass and it was not only delicious but visually stunning!  We started with quite a few appetizers; Warm Pretzels, Calamari, Truffle Fries, And Lobster Rolls. ( Don't judge there were five of us and we all shared!)  All the apps were very tasty but the definite stand out were the Lobster Rolls! Big juicy pieces of tender lobster wonderfully paired with a beautiful sauce and some small bits of cucumber for a nice crunch!  For our main dishes two of us got the Brisket Sandwich and the other two of us got the Lamb Burgers.  The Brisket Sandwich was absolutely delicious and absolutely huge!! Like two hands, jaw unhinged huge! I ended up taking my other half home! My fiance really loved the Lamb Burger, I sadly didn't get to taste it because I'm not the biggest fan of Blue Cheese, but both the guys finished theirs in a matter of minutes so it must have been tasty! I really like that all our entrees came with fries. I hate when everything is super pricey and al a carte. This really felt like you got what you paid for.  Lastly we got two orders of the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Please order this. I know you might be so full and you don't think you can make it one more bite but I promise you will be sorry if you don't!  Gordon Ramsay definitely did not disappoint! I can't wait to try some of his other restraints in Vegas!",

    "text": "Honestly wasn't too impressed by GR Pub & Grill.  I think when a celebrity chef puts their name on a restaurant, we assume that it should be spectacular but that isn't always the case.  We came by for dinner since the other half is a big fan of Chef Ramsay.  He watches Hell's Kitchen religiously, while I can barely tolerate all the yelling and drama.  I will say that I do like to watch his show Junior Master Chef though...but I digress.  As expected, the place was packed.  Especially since it is located across from the Colosseum, many people (myself included) wanted to eat dinner there before the Mariah Carey concert.  We arrived and were told it would be about a 20 min wait.  That worked out fine and we were seated inside for a table of two.  The ambiance is very pub-like with and I imagine there are actually some pubs like this in England.  Our waiter was just so-so.  We told him that we were in a hurry bc we were going to the concert after dinner.  He didn't really seem to care much and it took longer than expected to get our food.  25 minutes later, our salad and burger finally arrive.      The two items we ordered were just average and we could have gotten the same level of food at any bar and grill: -Pub Chopped Salad ($16):  I will admit that the salad was very fresh and they did give a lot of shrimp and grilled chicken.  The salad also contained ham, sliced apples, chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, white cheddar and pretzel crisps (their version of croutons).  It was supposed to have avocado too but I only found 2 small chunks.  The pretzel crisps was a nice touch which I liked.  -Grilled Beef Burger ($19):  Huge disappointment.  The beef patty was dry and unseasoned.  The only toppings on the burger were two slices of white cheddar.  There wasn't any lettuce or tomato so it made the burger completely lackluster.  A small side of fries accompanied the burger.  Presentation was nice as it came out on a chopping board but that's as far as it goes.  Total tab was $43.  Overall, not worth the hype or anticipation.  You could get a better burger at so many other places and probably for half the price.  The other half said that even Habit Burger was better.",

Waitress was very nice so even though the food was really bad and we still gave her good tip. But we will not go back for sure. We waited a very long time for our food and finally we got our food, but Steak was way over cook (almost well done) when we asked for medium rare. The good thing is that she took it back and waived from the bill. We realized we went to the wrong Gorden Ramsey restaurant. We suppose to go to Gorden Ramsey steak in Paris hotel. We were disappointed that this is one of Gorden Ramsey's restaurant because he has high standard for his chef from the show. We didnt enjoy the dinner at all because everything is just so bad.",

The Scotch Egg. Can't wait to go back again.",

I had to ask for utensils after my meal showed up, he didn't refill my ice tea until I was finished with my meal (it sat empty for 10 minutes). After I said I was done and he cleared my dishes, I had to wait over five minutes to get his attention so I could ask him for the bill. And the food was almost as bad. Lobster rolls were close to inedible- the menu states: server \"on Lemon Poppy Seed Brioche\". It was more like a toasted, dried out dinner roll. I love lobster rolls and this was the worst I've ever had.",

    "text": "Went there on May 26th, 2013 at 7pm.  There were 3 in our party and we were asked to wait 45 minutes.  When we returned, we were promptly seated.  About 10 minutes later, our waiter showed up for the first time to take drink orders.  By that time, we had already decided what we wanted for dinner.  Another 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with water and took our order.  Our appetizers arrive about 10 minutes later and the food was excellent.    Now for the not-so-excellent part.  After we finished our appetizers, we waited an additional 40 minutes before I started trying to find our waiter and ask him where our food was.  We noticed several other groups of people come in and get their entrees less than 20 minutes after they were seated.  Once I finally found him, he said he would check on it, and returned 5 minutes later with \"You food is next up, I just checked\".  20 minutes later, I was ready to leave and got up to find our waiter for the bill. I tracked him down again, and reminded him that we'd been there for almost 1.5 hours.  He gave me the look, then disappeared.  Another 5 minutes goes by, and finally our food shows up, right as we were about to bail.  The food was hot, outstanding and completely awesome.  It just took forever to get for some unknown reason, and I don't need to tell you how frustrating it was to watch people come in 10 minutes after you, get the same food you ordered, finish their meal and then leave, all before your food shows up.  Even though it was completely awkward, our waiter did apologize for the delays, but made no effort whatsoever to make it right.  No manager, no reasonable explanation, nothing.  Just a $144 bill.  It took us less than 15 minutes to eat the food that took them more than an hour to prepare.  So, the food was awesome, but the service was absolutely awful.  It was actually like participating in an episode of Hell's Kitchen, wondering if you'll ever actually get the food you ordered.  Except in this case, we got the \"pleasure\" of paying $144 for \"participating\" in this rather disappointing episode.  Gordon Ramsey seriously needs to tune this place.  Incredible food coupled with incredibly awful service essentially equals an awful experience.  With so many other awesome choices available for an outstanding dinner, I absolutely cannot recommend this place.  Even though the food was outstanding, we still left disappointed, and no one should pay $144 to come out of a restaurant disappointed.  We ordered:  Corn Soup English Ale Onion Soup Sheppard's Pie Filet Mixed Grill Fish'n Chips  NOTE: The Sheppard's Pie was the best we've had EVER.",

The interior style restaurant for younger people, not comfortable with small tables like Bar. And they bring the food in big square pieces of wood so imagine that (4 person) not to much space to look where I can put my drink, on the floor?   Menu looks nice with a great variety of different tasty choices but the food is not good. I feel expensive prices if you compare this with the flavor. We ordered appetizer, entree, dessert. And no one said a word about how good it was.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas to celebrate my son's 21st Birthday. We had high hopes as we celebrated another 21st Birthday 2 years earlier and had great experience, so we came back. I had made a reservation for a table of four, two months prior to our visit to Vegas and even specified the Birthday on the reservation. We arrive at the Pub, 8 minutes early and are greeted in a frantic fashion from the hostess staff and are told to move over to the side and wait, as if we were in the way while they seat another party of 4 without a reservation, before us. What was the point of making a reservation? We waited patiently and another hostess comes over and gives is a choice- high top in the bar or wait until a table open ups in the dining area. Again, what was the point of a reservation? Annoyed at this point, we take the high top. Another customer is using one of our bar stools, so I kindly ask her if I can sit in the chair. The hostess should have done this. The server was fine. The food was okay, but the portions were very small and the Prime Rib special for $55 was a complete price gouge- a fatty slice with really silly sized sides of mashed potatoes and carrots. The 8 oz filet served with 3 puny asparagus stalks for $42 was another price gouge. The shepherds pie portion was very small. The roasted chicken was served in a massive plate with massive amounts of chick peas relative to the small size roasted chicken. We prefer smaller portion sizes, but the price here at GR Pub & Grill has increased too much for what we received. We ordered 2 desserts and they were good, not great. Total bill with 2 beers and 1 cocktail, tax and tip exceeded $250. No Birthday mentioning, except from us at the high top table, in the bar area. Poor ambiance to celebrate a Birthday.  Next time in Vegas, we will pass.",

This is English Pub food done well... Nothing particularly adventurous, just very solid fare. The ambience is also a Vegas take on an English Pub... dark and casual... Very simple introverted space... Not much scenery or over the top design.   Had the Kettle chip nachos and Hell's Kitchen burger... All were awesome.  Burger could have used more heat as it's billed as spicy, but the flavors and proportions were great.   Sticky toffee pudding was phenomenal...

This place is a little pricey however it is worth it you can't really very from the menu too much as everything is either pre-marinated they only have certain kind of breads they do have vegetarian options and one thing on the dessert menu if you look at my pictures totally made me laugh it's called the spotted dick. Overall love it",

You can never go wrong at one of his restaurants.  The ambiance is nice, and staff is extra nice, and on their game. Looking into the restaurant you would never guess the place is as large as it is. Don't let it fool you. The rooms seem hidden, and trying to get to the restroom is like following a maze.  This is a really great restaurant. I love it here.",

When I first sat down, the bartender asked me if I was right or left handed, and placed the napkin/coaster on the appropriate side...who does that?! I felt pretty special and appreciated it.  The truffle fries were everything I would hope for and a little more (ketchup and honey mustard sauces really good). Crispy, truffle flavors, and good body of potato.   They had a decent selection of different beers and the bartender was helpful in recommending certain beers if you weren't sure what you wanted.",

Turned out to be about an hour and 30 minutes.   The experience was overall disappointing. The food took about 35 minutes to come out. One of the burgers were undercooked - came out raw. The waitress only came to the table once, drinks were empty.   Upon sitting I let the host know we had a birthday at the table. She said they have a brownie sundae to celebrate. Sadly the waitress never ordered it.   Terrible experience. Sorry Gordon.",

My husband had the steak and ale pie and I had the traditional fish and chips. Fish was just ok and the fries were not fresh fries and were served cold. Steak and Ale pie just ok. For a GR restaurant the bar is set high, plus there is a certain level of expectation. Ill never go back again! Need to pay attention Ramsey. QC needs work!",

It was just the right size for our family to split. My wife said that she would think fondly of it when she has her next sweet craving. There's no wonder Gordon Ramsay is successful.

I know the place goes off his name, but the food should match the hype.  By the way the pork belly was okay.  For $113.00 bill you would think the small portion of food would live up to hype...Not!  By the way I saw the fish and chips...$30 for that is a little amazing.  Good service and subpar food.  The service from the waiter and manager raised my review to 3 stars!",

    "text": "My experience with Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was unfortunately mixed.  The location (in the heart of Caesar's) and atmosphere are great!  My wife and I had a reservation- celebrating our Anniversary- and were seated promptly.  My wife, being British, was torn between ordering two classics- the Fish & Chips and Shepherds Pie.   The person seated next to us had a delicious looking Fish & Chips so we decided to get the best of both worlds- Fish & Chips as an appetizer and Shepherds Pie as her Entree.  I chose the burger.  The Fish and Chips arrived within just a few minutes, and from first look was disappointed.  The portion was significantly smaller than the table next to us.  We realize all pieces are not the same size and the portion will vary, but I would say ours was at least 50% smaller than our neighbors which was puzzling because I would expect Gordon Ramsey would have strict quality control standards.   Speaking of quality control, the fries were well over-cooked which was another major disappointment.  This was a 5 out of 10.  My wife Shepherds Pie was much better after a disappointing start.  The lamb ensemble and mashed potato had great flavor and was presented well. No complaints here.  9 out of 10.    My burger was pretty good.  8 out of 10.  Waiter, based on lack of personality, gets a 5. He didn't care that our fish looked shortchanged to our neighbor's. He was dull, nonchalant and half asleep.  In short- Your mileage will vary with the Fish and Chips.  Just look through the pictures on yelp and you will see all the different types that you might get.  And be prepared you may get an unusually small portion and a polite explanation \"they are all different sizes\".",

There was a limited view of the Seahawks game which we were hoping to catch some of while we ate lunch. This was probably more based on bad luck and timing than anything as there were plenty of tables with good views of TVs. There is an opportunity to better organize tables and TVs so there's no tables out of view of your favorite game on NFL Sunday's. I ordered the Fish and chips which was fine but very expensive for what I got.  The beer selection was good. We both ordered a flight of different beers so we could try many of them between the two of us.  Overall, the atmosphere is good, but with opportunity to improve. The food is fine. Nothing stuck out as bad, but also nothing stuck out as outstanding. The beer selection is good and probably the best reason I found to pop in here. The cost is high even for Vegas. Our lunch and beer flights ran over $100 for just two adults. I'd probably come back here again for afternoon or evening drinks but might find another place for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill is a 290-seat restaurant located inside Caesars Palace.  It is a restaurant that brings the British Pub experience to you with the atmosphere as well as the authentic British pub foods that it offers.  Upon walking up to the front entrance of the restaurant, I noticed a bunch of barrels stacked on top of each other.  The decor of the place was pretty cool.  The lighting was very dim and obviously this is a casual restaurant since it is supposed to mimic a British pub.  The pub has 36 different beers on tap as well as another 63 different bottled beers.  I don't drink so this was not a selling point for me.  I was more there for the Gordon Ramsay food and because the winner of Hell's Kitchen for one of the seasons was supposed to be the main chef at this particular restaurant.   The bf and I did not have to make reservations to Pub & Grill and we were glad to find out that there was no wait time.  This was possibly the foreshadowing of what was to come after we were seated.  Pub & Grill does serve a 3-course meal, but since the bf and I had just done the Hell's Kitchen courses at Gordon Ramsay's Steak inside Paris the night before, we decided not to do the courses at Pub & Grill.  We both ordered our own dishes and shared.  We ordered the GRP Lolli-Pop Chicken Wings which came with a stilton blue cheese dip.  You can either order a dozen wings which is $22 or 1/2 dozen wings which is $12.  As you can see from the picture, I felt like we got ripped off.  All we got were luke warm puny looking chicken wings that were overpriced in my opinion.  For $12, you'd expect to at least not be served wings from anorexic chickens.  Is it too much to expect hot food instead of warm?  Ramsay would be fuckin' pissed if he was there.  Next, we ordered the 9 oz Grilled Lamb Burger which consists of caramelized onions with a goats cheese-feta spread & rosemary brioche bun and is served with fries & a house pickle.  The price of this burger was $21.  The waitress couldn't stop raving about how good this burger was and that she highly recommended it.  The Grilled Lamb Burger came out and honestly, there was nothing special about it.  It tasted like any regular lamb burger.  For being pricey, you'd expect it to taste amazing or at least have a wow factor to it.  Nope!  It was a huge disappointment.  We should have demanded our money back and spent it on the burgers at BurGR.  At least they were a little bit cheaper and taste amazing!  The last dish we ordered was the Pan-Seared Diver Scallops which came with steamed clams, leeks, potato-bacon chowder & confit tomatoes.  This dish was $32.  This was another dish that came out luke warm.  For being super expensive, the clams were tiny and the chowder didn't really have much flavor.  It almost tasted as though someone had forgotten to season it.  This was a huge disappointment.  It was definitely not worth the money.  While eating this dish, I bit into a small piece of the clam shell that was mixed into the chowder.    Pub & Grill is Ramsay's worse restaurant in Vegas.  He needs to pay a visit there and make sure that everything is up to his standards.  Being served warm food is not acceptable unless that is how British pub food is served.  If that's the case, I do apologize in advance for talking shit.  Overall, the customer service was alright.  The food is way overpriced and it is not worth it so I don't recommend anyone going here.",

He reminds me a bit of myself in my college years striving for perfection over the cast iron grill at Buffalo Wild Wings.  Being a fan I was excited to try this place.  What to order?  this was the hardest question to answer since the ACT.  I wanted a burger but thought I should get out of my comfort zone and try something a bit more British, so I went with the pie sampler.  I thought this was a great idea so I could sample all the taste Gordon has to offer but it backfired a bit because it really is just an appetizer, so I was still a bit hungry afterwards.  Each meat pie was about as good as a meat pie can get, but that's not saying much.  Looking back I should have ordered either a whole pie or the burger, or maybe the sampler and a burger.  My friend had a burger and it looked amazing, I stole some fries when he wasn't looking, very good.  I will be back to try the burger.",

The menu is definitely tilted towards an English influence which should be no surprise.  I just wish I would have gotten a burger.

There's not much to say about our short time here, as we were seated, placed our order, drank and ate when ti came out, then headed out. Service was good and pretty quick given how busy it was, and the food was good, although not overly large in portion serving.  I think the only reason I can't give this four stars (I reserve five stars for places that blow my socks off) is due to the size of our appetizer and that while it was good, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, pretzels with cheddar beer sauce is *AMAZING* and the sauce actually was everything I was hoping it would be, it was just that the pretzels were lacking a bit of something, although I can't say exactly what. Maybe a bit more salt? I felt like I could have just used regular breadsticks instead of the pretzel ones as they just didn't have the pretzel flavour I was expecting.",

Comfy seating, and kind waitstaff. Now here is where it gets tricky...I asked what their signature dish was and our waitress swore by the fish & chips. My friend ordered that, with the mini pot pies. I ordered chicken Marsala (Brits are known for their Indian food right?), and some lemon shrimp cocktail.  Sorry, the Jasmine rice had hair in it, was obviously old, dried out...the chicken was ok. The only thing lemony about the shrimp was the cut up lemons on the side, nothing special, rather blah. The fish and chips weren't anything to rave about either. His mini pies were supposed to be lamb, chicken, and beef. No chicken came, but he stated it was pretty good. Will I go back? No. Would I recommend a friend? No  After paying for the meal, the waitress kind of left us hanging, as we had to ask another person to get us more drinks. I don't think Gordon Ramsey would be too pleased, not judging by his television shows. Maybe he better come to Vegas and manage his own businesses!",

I ordered it medium and it came medium well. Still it was very good and the sauce was nice. The potatoes that came with it were cold and not seasoned. The other veggies on the plate cold. I tried the chicken pot pie and it was not bad not great.   Dessert was a sundae. Waiter didn't recommend anything. It was average sundae nothing special. I think the place is not bad not great better than an average pub but not what I would have expected from someone so demanding of excellence.",

I met to co-workers there and it was a nice place to sit and chat since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I loved our waiter. He was really nice and made recommendations for us when I asked. It did take a while to have the food come out but since we were talking a lot we didn't mind.  I started dinner off with a cocktail. I had the spiced cider which was amazinggg. If you like any kind of ciders or if apples are your favorite fruit get this drink. It was very tasty. I also loved that they brought out pretzels and bread as a free appetizer. They give you a roll and three different kinds of pretzels along with a horse radish cheese dip and butter. Amazing and a great touch to the start of the meal. I got the Beef Cheek stew because our waiter said that if you wanted to try something different to eat that. I really enjoyed it. The beef was so so tender, maybe just a bit on the salty side. I was surprised because it wasn't so much of a stew as it was just beef with potatoes and veggies. I still enjoyed it though-I love when my beef is tender. We also got a side of the Yukon potatoes. They were great and went really well with the beef. I would get these as a side again. Then for dessert we had the chocolate dessert. I forget what its called but it has three different kinds of chocolate mousse in between chocolate cake and topped with whipped cream and chocolate caiver. It's served in a mason jar which I thought was cute. It was Delicious! And my favorite part of the meal (of course). I would get this again.  I really liked this restaurant and would go here again. The next time I plan on getting the mini sliders because I noticed a ton of people got them and they looked amazing! I also want to try the French Onion Soup. Excited to go back soon! :)",

    "text": "the food is great.  unfortunately the staff is pretty much terrible. Ceasars palace, known for luxury and service. Not here.  My wife and I visited here after being excited to eat at a gordon ramsay restaurant (we are fully aware he has probably never even been in the restaurant)   Food was all great, cocktails were great too. I can get great food and great cocktails at about 100 different places just off the top of my head. All 100 of them also provide service.  Greeting took 10-15, i  wasnt checking my watch because I was trying  to avoid my wife becoming aware of the lengthy wait, not because she is a bitch, because i didnt want her experience going south upon arrival.  cocktails took about 5 minutes.  not terrible, not quick (it was a monday night and not very busy)  Long story short, the service was sluggish at best, the server was friendly and generally acknowledged that things were moving slowly and she apologized. water under the bridge for us. the food made up for it..  Then the manager happened. Not the younger guy who had stopped by our table once to say hello and ensure we were happy. Not him at all, this manager was the old guy, the one wandering around the restaurant not talking  to anyone. the one who spent all his time chatting up the hostesses until....  He turned all of the music off and all of the tv's off 15 minutes till 11. at first I thought this was odd (i thought they closed at 1030) i then remembered that they closed at 11.  wtf? why dont you just tap us on the shoulder and demand we pay before getting the fuck out? the most ironic part is that we would have been gone already if our server wasnt once again totally absent for 15 minutes.   This manager needs to gtfo, wrong business for him, I wont waste my timeor money in any of GR establishments again as well as ceasars palace.   Too many other options out there to operate this way.",

We had the pub sliders for an appetizer which were delicious and our entrees were equally as good. The real star was the dessert which was a form of strawberry shortcake and it was out of this world. I think one thing people need to understand before going is that this is an \"English Pub\" so the food is not exactly typical fare for us Americans but still delicious if you are willing to go a little out of your comfort zone.",

We came at around 3:30pm and we were able to order off the lunch & happy hour menu, even though it was a holiday!  We ordered a few appetizers off the happy hour menu- truffle fries, onion rings, pub spot, and wings. The truffle fries and onions rings were yummy and crispy. I was happy that I could taste the truffle oil! The pub spot is basically a mini burger which I enjoyed! The wings were a huge portion but a bit dry.   For the menu, I ordered a few small items and when it came, they arranged it all together on a plate for me! It is super thoughtful of them! I had the mini mac n cheese and the brussels sprouts side. Mac n cheese was yummy, I had the garlic flavor. The brussels sprouts were seasoned so well but a little too oily.  Even though this place is quite big, the food comes our relatively fast. My family also enjoyed their meals. The fish and chips ($30) were good, but the portion is tiny for the price.   Overall- friendly service, loud ambiance, and food came out fast. Our waters were constantly refilled, server always checking up on us, and the food was tasty. I would recommend during happy hour if you're looking for a quick bite!",

Fortunately, the food was excellent.  I love beef Wellington and it was absolutely perfect here: a tender steak that was medium rare and so tender you could cut it with a spoon and a flaky pastry that was not one bit doughy.  The $57 price tag gave me a little sticker shock but it was worth every penny.  For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was the perfect ending.  I was not expecting something this great but I guess Chef Ramsay taught this kitchen well.  Service was excellent.",

It would have been better if the tv was in a different location as it was tough to watch right next to us. It was relatively loud based on the number of people but you could still talk. The seats were slightly low so your food felt like it was a bit too high to reach.   Food: The food was okay. I have never seen anything with Gordon Ramsay but the food was pretty good. I think his use of pretzel bread in salads and as a side is awesome. They didn't have salt and pepper on the tables and I wish they did.  Service: Our server was cool. He was super mellow and chill. Make sure you check in because you get 1 free desert. Overall, not bad, a bit pricey but worth trying out.",

Our waiter also informed us that we get a free dessert if there are any Yelpers at the table. Helloo, yes!! We got the sticky toffee pudding.

They were crispy and not soggy at all, however it did kind of seem like the seasoning was missing. The fries were fine, but thick cut fries aren't my favorite so I can't really have an un-biased opinion on those.   My parents ordered a burger and fries and the BLT with kettle chips. Both the kettle chips and regular fries were so, so good! My mom said the BLT was delicious, and my dad loved the burger.   I LOVE soft pretzels and saw people getting them after we had ordered. My dad asked our waiter (who was AMAZING- I believe his name was Adam) about them and he said they were only on the bar menu, but could (and did) get us some. You get three sticks with cheese and a mustard. They were pretty good, not great, but I was just happy that our waiter got them for us.",

The server was good at making suggestions, and described the dishes thoroughly.    Overall, I was underwhelmed by my experience.",

It started with the design/decor of the restaurant, the most delicious food I've ever tasted, and my server, Rodney, was spot on, friendly, professional, knowledgeable and I wish he could train every other server on the planet! Yes, he is that good.  The shrimp cocktail starter literally does not compare to any other I've ever tasted -- the quality of shrimp and light creamy sauce \"magic\", beef tenderloin cooked to perfection, tender melt-in-your mouth and the peppercorn sauce was the perfect compliment. And then that desert - sticky toffee pudding. Wow. Never had anything like that before. You'll need to try it for yourself, I'm not going to spoil the surprise!  I cannot recommend this restaurant, or Rodney enough. Thank you, Gordon Ramsey, for your vision and culinary expertise that you are sharing with the world. I would like to shake your hand one day to thank you. Health and happiness to you.",

I'm a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen television and Gordan Ramsey so this was an easy choice. I love when the menu is posted on the outside of the establishment and my mouth was watering before we walked in!   My mother in law always said \"Inly go to the restaurant with a full parking lot\". Well, this \"parking lot\" was packed!  And for good reason!  The food was fantastic!  And the atmosphere was full of energy. I'm definitely coming back here!",

    "text": "For as expensive as this place is for pub food, you'd expect much better quality. Especially because there's the name of a world-renowned chef on the building.   I admit that this place wasn't our first choice but after learning that there was a 6 hr total wait to get a seat at Bacchanal, we were starving and looking for something to eat fast.  We were seated almost immediately at the pub and grill.   Service is sub-par, again, I expected a lot more from a Gordon Ramsay branded restaurant.  They seem disorganized and unprofessional at the hostess stand. Our waitress was nice, but that was just about the extent of our decent experience here.   I opted to get the fish and chips since I've heard so many good things about it. $30 for two pieces of fish and some soggy fries.  I was terribly disappointed by this dish, and on top of it, the batter was incredibly salty.  We also had the lamb shank which was bland, the scallops that were super salty, and the ribeye that was not the least bit tender. The only decent thing was the Shepard's pie.  We also had the calamari and the crispy pork belly.  Neither were impressive and I wouldn't recommend ordering either again.    Expensive is what I expect when I come to Vegas, so I'm not mad about the price. I'm just really disappointed that it was fairly pricey and the food quality and service was sub-par.   I wouldn't recommend  this place, there are far better restaurants in Vegas.",

The lobster mac and cheese was a bit creamy, not drying and the tender lobster inside of it went so good with the cheese.

    "text": "My party decided to bounce from Alto Bar and walked around to find another spot to hang before heading out for another event.  None of us were really familiar with the layout of Caesars, so we walked around hoping to bump into another bar (like we did with Alto) then low and behold... Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill.   And what really pulled us in was when we all came into realization we were right dab smack in the middle of happy hour! WOOHOO!   We were seated on a table for 6 (although there were initially only 4 of us) which was a good thing since we were joined by 2 other people much later.   Half off all draft beer, we all went for 35oz drafts, hellfire wings (10), pigs in a blanket (2) and an order of truffle fries.   So... we're in Vegas, right?! In a pub, nonetheless located in Caesar's Palace which is located on the strip. Needless to say, our expectations are a bit high, but not high enough where we become completely unreasonable, but I have to say there is NO reason why it'd take more than 20 minutes for beer. If we ordered some complicated cocktail mixes, I might lean toward better understanding, but beer!? On tap?! NO.   Our server, Tesla, came by apologizing for the delay. 20 minutes gone and ALL our apps delivered, but still no drinks. Tesla, for a second time, came by apologizing again for the delay on our drinks and that \"it's coming right up.\"   All of us were a disappointed at that. We should have been at least a quarter through our drinks by the time our food got there.   Food was bomb, though. The wings, although called HELLFIRE, weren't spicy at all. There is a kick to it, but the sweet tempered it down a bit. Worth the price at a buck per piece during happy hour. Pigs in a blanket were okay. They are slightly bigger than what I'm used to and I really liked the sausage. There was a different type of seasoning to it vs. the ordinary ones I've had. I liked it. (Not everyone had it, but whoever did didn't really agree with me - she said it tasted more like regular Vienna sausage.) But the truffle fries topped them all. We were all absolute fans of these. The crisp, the crunch, the mushroom topping. This was perfect. We liked it so much we put in 2 more orders.   FOOD: 4.  SERVICE: 2. (Not our server's fault, but there should be NO reason for that 20 minute wait for beer.)   VALUE: 5. (Happy hour menu is a steal!)  PARKING: Located inside Caesar's Palace. Valet or self-park.  OVERALL: 3.75.   I'm confident the beer gaffe was an isolated incident. I'd come back for happy hour should a stop at Caesar's get included on future visits.",

    "text": "Thursday evening and looking for dinner at Ceasar's Palace - Gordon Ramsay Pub & grill is an okay choice.  It's a tough review to do because certain aspects were better than others - but averaging it out I'm sticking with just 3 stars.  NOT to be confused with Hell's Kitchen, located in front of Ceasar's Palace...  The pub is located inside the casino.  Reservations- check! Figuring out the reservations aren't for Hell's Kitchen - unfortunately check! Got there way early and they still seated us - check! Seated promptly- check! They brought out water and menus, and the evening began.  After ordering some sodas and appetizers; then ordered our main meals.  The waitress was very nice and then got several large groups seated around us...  After the food came, she checked in on us  and always made sure we had refills ready for our sodas - then at some point we realized that we had been there for over 2 hours.  By the time we paid and left (and chose not to eat desert here), we were there nearly 2 hrs and 45 minutes.  So while it was enjoyable, it took a long time to get through dinner.  Service was good, but it took a while to pay and get out.  Some of the food was great and other parts were very average.  PS - they have Pepsi products BUT NO Mt. Dew!!!",

It was a little pricy, but that is expected of a Las Vegas restaurant.  Service was good, servers were friendly, attentive and quick.  We ordered beef wellington, beef poutine, scallops with corn puree and uk beer flights.  Beef wellington: is Gordon Ramsay signature dish, you will see it in a lot of his restaurants and his cook books, and it does not disappoint.  The beef was cooked perfectly, and the pastry was flacky and buttery.  Beef poutine: was a pretty good dish, almost as good as a regular canadian poutine.  UK beer flights:  I was curious about UK beers, so this was my chance to taste different varaties from the country.  Scallops with corn puree:  were cooked perfectly, seasoned just right.  Corn puree complimented the sweetness of the scallops. And they gave a decent amount of scallops.  Overall the experience was good.  Being its my first time eating at a famous chefs restaurant i was impressed by the level detail in the food and service provided.  I would like to try more of Gordon Ramsays other restaurants someday",

    "text": "I LOVE GORDON RAMSAY!!!! I watch his shows... blah blah blah... we all have the same story.  I've been dying to eat at one of his places so when I was last in Vegas I made it a point to drive onto the strip to eat here. I was SOOO EXCITED! I mean Michelin star Gordon Ramsay! I have a Michelin Star restaurant near me I love and go when I can do my expectations where high!   Leaving the atmosphere and sloppy drunk as out of it as it's Vegas and that's the culture...   I had been looking online and was going back and forth between 2 meals... but I saw one on yelp and I was sold. I sat at the bar as I was alone and sat salivating. I ordered the steak and ale pie! When it arrived I was instantly confused by the veg. It was either not cooked and should have been as I normally eat asparagus and squashes cooked... or they accidentally the wrong things on the wrong plate. (I should have sent it back at that point.)I could have almost over looked that as the Steak and Ale pie was still waiting! THIRD BITE into my haft empty pot pie... I get a glob of fat. The picture doesn't do it justice. Inch squared and haft inch thick. Bigger then any of my actual meat pieces. I've never been so disappointed in a meal. If this was Denny's I would be annoyed. This isn't Denny's and if I'm paying $27 for a haft empty pot pie and uncooked veg I at least expect some meat and flavor in it. When asked how my meal was I shrugged and stated ok. By the end of it I was at \"fine and that's the best you are getting out of me\".   I got a sticky toffee pudding and had the waitress not been trying so hard to improve my meal and mood by going above and beyond to pour the sauce on it probably would have been amazing. She didn't know I'm not big on sweets so the very sweet sauce was a bit much and I would have only put haft on at most. Still was the best part of my meal. I've never been so unbelievably categorically disappointed in a meal in my life.   This was SUCH a disappointment! I expected better!",

The scallops came out lukewarm, the beef Wellington was also lukewarm plus dry and difficult to cut. it tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for a long time.I had to saw through it! I sent it back and the second one came out the same.  We were seated at a booth and the seat was a bench. It's too low for the table plus, to pull it closer all three of us on that side had to try to scoot forward at the same time.  I was truly disappointed as I expected greatness from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant! To think of the way he rips on chefs on Tv.... perhaps Gordon Ramsey should go spend some time saving his own disastrous restaurant .",

Always wanted to visit one of his restaurants. Yesterday, on our way from Grand Canyon to California after grueling rim to rim hike we had time till our flight and decided to hang out in Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.  From the first moment we felt well taken care of by all the staff members, but especially by our waiter Rodney. What a great personality, professionalism, attention to detail and sense of humor :)  We had Caesar's salad which was very fresh, dressing was really tasty and the shavings of parmigiano cheese rounded it up nicely.  I had calamari - my favorite pub's starter. Fresh, nicely seasoned, and cooked to perfection.  Las but not least - Fish & Chips, of course. We think it was the best Fish & Chips we've ever had. Fish was moist and cooked nicely, crust was thin, well seasoned and crispy. Fries were delicious and I loved mashed peas seasoning a lot.  Contrary to the other reviewer we were delighted that water was served without ice :) But we are Europeans...  Thanks to good food and our wonderful waiter Rodney Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill was the highlight of our long journey home. Thank you!",

We started with the wings and pigs in a blanket. Both were an absolute miss. The wings were traditional, generic and poorly executed buffalo wings. Which was so disappointing because when we go to AC we look forward to splitting a dozen of their wings, which are far from traditional. I would strongly suggest collaborating with the AC location on this item. The pigs in a blanket were edible but I can't think of anything else to say. After I bit of each item we both agreed to cut or losses here and move on. There are too many fantastic options in LV to waste a meal here.     I'm so glad I've gone to the AC location first. If I went to the LV location first, I never would've given AC a chance.",

They took money off the bill because of it. Come on gordon, Rogelio Fernandez JR seems like he may not be in control of his kitchen !!!",

I had the lamb burger and the cumin on the slaw plus the five spice on the green pepper overwhelmed the whole thing. In the end, the lamb in the burger was lost and it just was not a $21 burger for me. Fries were okay but their ketchup was pretty good. Brioche bun is an extra $1 and the server up charges that automatically - I feel like if u guys are going to do that without asking the customer, why even bother putting on the menu that u have an option on which bread you can offer?   Anyways, I was really looking forward to get blown away, and in the end, I just left disappointed. Maybe next time Ramsay.",

We had chicken wings for an app, a burger and a presto chicken sandwich for main course, and the sticky toffee pudding to end the meal.   The pesto chicken sandwich was to die for. It had so many fresh ingredients.   Normally, we do not get dessert, but we kept seeing that sticky toffee pudding ordered at other tables. With much envy, we decided to order it ourselves. We had no regrets.   I still admit, the price was high, but this does not change my five star rating as I know what we were getting into.",

    "text": "On our most recent trip to Las Vegas, we stopped in to have a bite and relax the feet from walking all day and decided to try another Gordon restaurant. We were seated very quickly and was greeted immediately by our server, Yaneisy. She quickly brought us a round of drinks and added a couple of glasses of water. The mad Russian had Mule's Hind Leg and I chose Goodbye Blue Sky. Both drinks were good and refreshing. For food, we had a classic bar menu taste in our mouths and ordered Nachos, deviled eggs, and Fish and Chips. The food came out hot and was well presented. The order of nachos was large and the fish was well cooked. No complaints about either the food or the service. All told, it was a good experience and we wouldn't shy away from coming back. Prices are a little steep, even for Vegas. $30 for fish and chips.... I don't mind spending money on a good meal, but let's keep it reasonable. Two drinks and bar food was $93. The reason for the three stars was not the service or the quality of the food, it's for the value of the whole meal. Seems to me that being in the center of a casino, and a winning brand, ought to make it a volume restaurant, not a place to make a killing on low traffic. We'd come back for sure as we had a nice meal and you won't regret coming here if you're hungry.",

Service was great, even had a few good drinks. It's a little over priced in my opinion. I'm wondering if Gordon is really involved with this restaurant based on the lack of quality.

    "text": "Big fan of Mr. Ramsay's TV shows.  My wife and I figured we'd be sure to get a great meal here.  I asked for a great wait-person and we got one.  Good start.  Bottles of wine marked up 4x retail, that's kind of steep, even for Vegas,  but it's OK if the meal is stellar.  My wife had the tomato soup, which was yummy and came out piping hot, just as she requested.  5 stars there.  The bread on the side was supposed to be a crostini, I guess, but the bread wasn't toasted, just warmed, so the topping and cheeses soaked right into the bread and created a bready mush.  That's just lousy work in the kitchen.  I had a Caesar salad, and our server asked if I liked anchovies, and as a matter of fact I do.  Usually a Caesar is made with tinned anchovies that have been cured.  The anchovies were fresh fish, fileted and lying on top of the salad.  None of the salty, cured taste of tinned anchovies.  The dressing was incredibly bland.  Hey!  There's supposed to be garlic, dried mustard, Worcestershire sauce and spicy goodness in there!  The kitchen made up for the lack of taste by liberally pouring the dressing all over the romaine lettuce.  The bottom leaves were floating in it.  Seriously, the worst Caesar I can remember having anywhere.    Our filet came out just right, and the bearnaise sauce we ordered was very nice.  The asparagus that accompanied the filet was woody.  The stems should have been trimmed up nearly to the tips so that what we ate was just the best, so another bit of sloppy work in the back of the house.  We also ordered mashed potatoes and a side of mushrooms.  The potatoes were good, served nice and warm (not hot enough for my wife who likes these things super-hot).  The mushrooms were nothing special or bad, just standard button mushrooms cut thick and sauteed in butter.    Then we had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  Oh, baby, was that good.  Super, super good.  5 stars and then some, so we ended the meal on a very happy note.     Oh yeah, English pub decor as \"designed\" by a high schooler from Columbus, OH.  Maybe a step up from a TGI Fridays.  Music playing, 80s disco and such, was loud, loud, LOUD.  Loudest restaurant in Vegas.  Hostesses were wearing very unflattering dresses designed to look like the old newsprint that fish and chips were wrapped up in back in the day.  Cute idea, but the dresses were oddly cut so that all of the women looked four months pregnant, and none of them were!  Definitely the worst-dressed hostesses in Vegas.  :-(    So... serious faults from a kitchen (supposedly) set up by Gordon Ramsay.  Half of the dishes would have earned F-bombs on his shows.  The other half were good.  So, three stars.  Would I go there again?  No, there are too many really good places to eat in Vegas.  Live and learn.",

I come from restaurant business of 6 years and my wife was pointing out more things than i was.  First off took us about 10 mins + to wait for our server because he had a problem with another guest.  Second took about 10 mins for our drinks to arrive.  Third the environment and people who worked here looked so lost.  Fourth I'm almost 100% sure i was served ketchup with my calamari. Now this could of been a runner mistake but i doubt it.  So all i had to eat was some fries.  Fifth after eating our food we wait 10+ mins for the bill  Last but not least i told the hostess to note a birthday for my wife and nothing was done.  I should of just gone to Applebee's or Chili's and spent the same amount of money for more food and more drinks and PROBABLY better service.",

He disappeared and a while later I saw him and asked again.  He told me that the dispensers kept getting clogged and that's why they didn't give it to people.  Wait, so did you run out?  Or are the dispensers clogged?  If the dispensers are clogged I'd like to suggest the following... since they are essentially metal creamers with a hinged, unlatched top that has holes, just open, put some in a rammekin and bring some over.    At the end of our meal we had to ask for our check several times.  When it came we gave two credit cards (not uncommon) and asked the bill to be split 60/40.  Our waiter looked at us like he had no clue what that meant and then about ten minutes later came back and said, \"So, if I put 91 on one and 71 on the other is that right?\"  WHAT?!  This is a very basic math problem.  And, in case math is not your forte, you can use the POS computer or a calculator (or a PENCIL) to figure out that it's $64.80 and $97.20.  Now, we didn't need it to the penny but seriously?",

    "text": "A few of us went to this place over the weekend.  Although I don't find British food all that exciting, I had to give this place a try...why not?  The interior and decor were ok.  This is a pub so, it's not a place to take your date.  There's bread service of pretzels with butter and a cheddar spread.  It's about $20-30 per entree, $10+ for sides like English chips - depending on the menu (there's a pub menu and a grill menu).    We wanted to try the duck confit poutine but unfortunately, they weren't available.  Such bad news.  So, we ordered truffle chips, short-rib and cheek sandwich, steak, pork belly, and cornish hen.  For dessert we had peanut butter and jelly, sticky toffee pudding, butterscotch pot de creme and potted triple chocolate trifle.  Nothing exciting about the truffle chips and the steak.  I mean, they were good...just nothing exciting.  Except for maybe, one tidbit about how they cook their chips/fries 3 times: boiled, baked and fried.    CORNISH HEN: It came with veggies and I'm glad I ordered a side of English chips or I would've ended up hungry.  The skin was nice and crisp and full of flavor. 4/5  PORK BELLY: This was my favorite out of all the stuff we ordered. Fatty, crispy and delicious! 5/5  SHORT-RIB AND CHEEK SANDWICH: It was quite tasty.  Reminds me of a dish my mom made called mechado...but in a sandwich. 4/5  PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY: It has a hint of peanut butter and some blackberries.  I'm not a fan. 2/5  STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: A classic.  It's warm, ooey-gooey and served with a scoop of ice cream and it was just perfect! 5/5  BUTTERSCOTCH POT DE CREME: It's got pumpkin and a hint of nutmeg with pumpkin seeds on top. Reminds me of fall/Thanksgiving. 4/5  TRIPLE CHOCOLATE TRIFLE: I'm a chocoholic so I had to have this. Not the best chocolate dessert I've had but it's good. I finished my dessert without a problem. 4/5  The food was good but the service needs to be improved.  Our food came one at a time and we normally wait until the last person gets her/his food before we all start eating.  A few follow-ups later, the last person got her food and by the time, everyone's food already had gotten cold.  The manager came and talked to us so, our desserts were comped.  It took forever to get drink refills and if you ask for sweetener or anything at all...you might have to wait 30 minutes to get it.  So, overall, I'd give this place 3.5/5 stars.  If I were Gordon Ramsay, I would tell the staff to \"f@*% off!\"",

The ambiance was casual and great for chilling.   This is the second Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've tried. The first one was the GR burger in Planet Hollywood. It doesn't make sense to compare the two as the menu and the dining experience are completely different. I got truffle fries and grilled salmon, which was like a seasonal special dish. The seafood was really bomb to my surprise! Service wise, I have to say that Planet Hollywood does a better job. The staff there are passionate and responsive to your request or questions. Here they are busier and less attentive.   Overall I had a amazing time here. I'm excited to come back next time!",

There was a 15-20 min wait to get in, no big deal, & compared to the 2 hr Bacchanal wait this seemed super minor. Our server (Ricardo I think?) did a great job, was personable, offered great advice, & was knowledgeable of the menu. Zero complaints there. Ambiance was fine, comfy chairs, TVs conveniently placed for sports, with kind of a modern British pub feel/layout.  We started off with the Devilishly Deviled Eggs, which are served with the deviled yolks in a separate bowl, and are amazing.  Super great flavor on the deviled yolks (is that bacon I taste??), great consistency, and an easy way to get some yolk with every bite. Next up were the Welsh Rarebit ham sandwich, and the Short Rib & Cheek sandwich.  Both had excellent flavor, were served hot, and were of more than adequate size.  My gf preferred her short rib/cheek sandwich, while I preferred the taste of the ham/rarebit cheese sauce, but we agreed both were very good.  We subbed out our fries for the mashed potatoes, and neither of us were disappointed.  I also got an imperial pint of Boddingtons, took maybe 7-10 minutes to be delivered (only real service delay), but was frosty cold when it arrived.    We had no issues with waiting for food, service in general, or anything else that several reviewers have mentioned.  I guess this place might struggle for service consistency based on crowd load, and dinner sounds like it is the worst time for issues, but for lunch time, British pub-style comfort food (read: super when hungover), this place completely hit the spot!",

    "text": "This review for the manager of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in Caesar Palace Las Vegas. While I will concede some time has passed since we patronized the restaurant . I am unable to forget our pleasant experience . During the mid afternoon of August 17, my husband and I stopped in for appetizers and a few cocktail before going, later that evening to Ruth Chris's for dinner. We were celebrating for our 19th wedding anniversary .  After enjoying appetizers and cocktail, our waitress, while carrying a tray with full  dirty dishes, leftover food & drinks, accidentally spilled the tray and all of its contents on me. My blouse and my purse were soaked and the pain of the dishes falling on me was  excruciating . The waitress was True professional , concern about me and most apologetic. Her manager was another story, it took him nearly 10 min. to come check on my husband and me. He never apologized, he never offered  to pay to have  my blouse cleaned, and instead of writing off our entire bill he simply paid for our cocktail . I was humiliate and embarrassed. Very awful & unprofessional manager !!!",

I had the onion soup and my wife had the pretzels, both were really good.  The bartender recommended a English beer if never had before that was really good, not something I would've normally ordered.  The   Staff was great.  We are a huge fan of his shoes do it was really cool to finally go to one if his restaurants. I would definitely recommend stopping in here.

    "text": "We came here for our last night in Vegas. The food was OK for the money, but honestly Umami burger or the Counter is equal if not better. I will say that my drink the garden spritz was awesome!   We had the lamb burger and the regular burger. The lamb burger was great, but the other burger had to be sent back, it was supposed to be rare but it came out medium, and we requested truffle oil on our fries, but that didn't happen either. Props does go out to our waitress ( I do not have her name :(, but she lived in Mexico prior) who took care of us, she insisted on returning the burger and fixed the fries. We also had the sticky pudding, which I'd order again and the bread pudding was also yummy.   I guess the one thing that bothers me is that on Kitchen Nightmares you have Mr. Ramsay saving other restaurants, but this our third time at one of his and I have yet to say Wow, you can tell Gordon Ramsay \"the dude from TV\" owns this place.   The floor to the bathroom was so greasy my husband and I had to hold on while walking. We were joking about the lawsuit that is just waiting to happen. And the men's bathroom was missing toilet paper and when they brought it, it didn't fit the holder. Silly things that are huge lazy oversights from management and are the kind of things that Mr. Ramsay would fix on his TV show.   So, Mr. Ramsay if you or your staff read this, keep in mind that we don't just rate the food. I was a restaurant/bar manager in NYC for 11 years and I totally understand things happen, but if it hadn't been for our waitress, who seemed to be acting out of her experience and not out of her GR P& G training, I would have given you two stars.",

    "text": "I live in Las Vegas so I'm used to having some great places to eat. And in my view  one of the best places on the Strip is Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris casino. We go there from time to time and we're consistently impressed. It's excellent from the moment you sit down to the minute you leave. We're not all too concerned with price, particularly for a great experience, but it's hard not to notice how expensive Steak is. Still, it's just that good.   This weekend we gave Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill a try at Caesars casino. It's decidedly different. Far more casual than Steak and focused on pub style food. Overall, we had a very good experience but as I recollect it now, I'm not sure it's enough to get us to go back. It's the kind of place that I'd gladly step into if I were strolling through Caesars, perhaps there to shop at the attached mall, but I don't think I'd make a special trip in just to eat there again. It's not that it's bad, not at all. But it's surrounded by a city full of great dining experiences.  To start (and despite some terrible reviews here to the contrary), our server was lovely, vivacious and helpful. She was friendly and attentive. The bar menu, complete with some innovative custom cocktails, tons of beer options, and a serviceable wine list, was presented on an iPad that provides plenty of details and an easy way to sort through to find what you want. We started with two of their own cocktails (I tried \"Mother's Ruin,\" a nice mix of gin, sage liqueur, cucumber and lime), and some oysters, which were tastefully presented on cutting boards with traditional accompaniments. The bread service was a nice array of crusty, warm, house-baked pretzels (three different kinds) and a nice cheese dipping sauce, all very good.   The only hiccup in service was when our mains arrived so quickly that our appetizers hadn't yet been cleared. The servers who delivered them (not our waitress but two other men) seemed flummoxed. Their hands full they sort of just looked at us to move the dishes aside for them. But the table being small, there really was no place to put the spent plates and utensils. A line manager came to help, but he too seemed sort of clueless and overwhelmed. Neither of us thought too much of it and helped as best we could, but it was a strange moment that you'd expect the team was better trained to handle.  Our food was good. I had the beef cheeks, which has the consistency of a pot roast. It was served over some mashed potatoes and roasted onion. The portion was very generous and the dish was tasty, though just a little underseasoned. My wife had the mustard-basted flat iron steak served with an onion puree and Stilton cheese. Good, but underwhelming, she said.  We split sides of smashed fingerling potatoes (which were seasoned with double cream, butter, and black truffle) and creamed spinach with Stilton cheese. Both were very good. The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was excellent.  At the bar that night was Jan'el Witt, the recent winner of Ramsay's television show \"Hell's Kitchen.\" Our waitress told us that she'd begin her reward as the \"head chef\" of the Pub & Grill in August.   So, in all, that leaves us at about a 3-star rating. A nice evening, a good meal, a fun time. But with so many options in Vegas, I'm not sure we'll be back again to the Pub & Grill. Unlike Gordon Ramsay Steak, which just screams a kind of uniqueness, Pub & Grill is good, but perhaps not special enough to warrant a return trip.",

The onion soup was laden with so much salt we couldn't even get through it.  All woke up the next day looking like the Goodyear Blimp - puffy eyes etc. I'm a Brit and sadly his menu didn't even come close to a \"pub\".  In all fairness, I don't even think he wrote the menu.  Their host staff look as though they have been stuffed into fish and chip wrappers. Completely unflattering dresses. Come on people, a pub should be the easiest restaurant to get right, but you tried too hard and you got this one wrong.",

    "text": "Sadly, I have to give Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, a less than stellar review. I can only muster the kindness to give this restaurant two stars.  I must admit, that were my rating based solely on my latest dining experience there, I would give the restaurant three stars, and, had I based my review solely on my first dining experience there, I would have given four stars.  I'm sure that you will ask, \"How does the average of 3 and 4 equal two?\"  The answer: disappointment.  This will sound silly, but bear with me.  The reason I returned to P&G after my first visit is also the reason I will not return: potatoes.  Specifically, two potato dishes: the Potato Puree and the Pub Fries.  These were not ordinary mashed potatoes and French fries.  These were a demonstration of what a potato can taste  like if a fine-dining approach is taken when preparing ordinary dishes.  Every now and again you taste a dish and experience it for the first time all over again.  Such was my experience with the fries and mashed potatoes at P&G.  They made me feel that, as a foodstuff, potatoes have much more potential that I had previously imagined.    The key to their french fries was the cooking technique: thick-cut potato planks, steamed, then lightly coated in seasoned flour, then deep-fried, then baked.  The result:  a hearty potato plank with a crispy outer crust that created the perfect seal to keep steam inside.  When you cut into them, you discovered a steamy, flaky potato meat.  These fries did not need any condiments whatsoever, and highlighted how good a potato can taste if treated properly   The mashed potatoes had a beautiful flavor.  The fluffy peaks of this dish were topped off with a drizzle of a chive infused olive oil that exploded in your mouth, filling your entire palette with the aroma of garden-fresh chives.  The key to this explosion was temperature of the potatoes: served piping hot.  On my second visit, I ordered these two side dishes again.  This time, the Pub Fries were plain, old french fries, and slightly soggy at that.  The mashed potatoes were a salty, gluey concoction that someone had tried to repair by thinning it out with copious amounts of cream and butter.  They were served cold.    Other highlights of the evening: arrived at 7:15pm and checked in for my 7:15pm reservation.  The hostess forgot to check me in, and when I made eye-contact with her every time she seated a walk-in customer before me, she quickly looked away and left the podium.  I approached a different hostess and was seated right away.  I ordered the seared scallops: scallops were seared on one side only. They were served in a bland seafood broth, with carrots, and artichoke hearts.  Not flavorful at all.  I ordered an espresso with dessert and it arrived cold.  The chocolate mousse trifle was sensational, though.  At any rate, I believe that what happened to this restaurant is not  so much carelessness on the part of its founder or staff.  It is a reaction to the caliber of the customer.  I spoke to the manager about the food, and he admitted that they had to change some recipes because their customers did not see the value in waiting extra time for french fries to be cooked three ways or for mashed potatoes to be prepared to order.  So, they have turned from their fine-dining philosophy to a food-mill philosophy: crank out orders.  And that is where the disappointment lies.  P&G once provided a fine-dining take on British pub fare.  It now caters to the lowest common denominator and provides tourists a place to grab a quick bite and gain some bragging rights: \"I went to Vegas and ate at Gordon Ramsay's.  You know?  That guy from TV?\"  Sadly, the Gordon Ramsay on TV is no longer anywhere to be found at P&G.  The Gordon Ramsay on TV preaches fine ingredients,  food prepared to perfection, good seasoning, good service, consistency, and, above all, passion and pride.  Where is the pride to be found when you don't stand by your food, and, instead, you cut corners to ramp up production.  Sorry, that's not fine-dining.  That's a factory.  I'll gladly drop $20 at Applebee's for factory food.  Not $200 at Gordon Ramsay's.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares? Try \"You Don't Know From a Nightmare Until You've Sat at Your Own Bar, Gordon Ramsay.\"  We went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill this evening to watch the NBA Playoffs. Things started off well enough--we though the fish and chips were a bit greasy and way overpriced, and the french fries tasted burnt, but this was our first time at this restaurant, so we just thought that they were prepared strangely. When someone next to us was served the same dish, we realized that our french fries HAD been burned beyond all recognition.  We were having a fun time with the bartenders--lots of laughing and jokes. However, one of the bar backs, Antoine, followed my girlfriend when she went to the bathroom. Antoine, is a large, menacing character, and she was not comfortable with his aggressive behavior. When she came back from the bathroom, he came out from the back and handed her his phone number. Later, he said, \"You better not have thrown that number away. You better call me or you can't ever come in here again.\"  At the end of the evening, one of the bartenders, Keith, put two drinks in front of us that we did not order, and said, \"Try this.\" We assumed that he wanted us to try a new drink he was working out--we are very familiar with bars, and it wouldn't be the first time that a bartender had asked us to try his drink. I did not care for mine, so I wasn't drinking it. When Antoine came out again, he said, \"What's wrong?\" I said that I did not like it. Antoine then proceed to PICK UP MY DRINK, DRINK OUT OF THE STRAW, AND PUT THE DRINK BACK IN FRONT OF ME. I sat, mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness, and all I could manage to utter was, \"I don't want that.\" He then took the drink and said, \"I can't drink this out here, but I will take it in the back. Thanks for the drink!\" I have never seen anything like this. As I type this, I still cannot fathom that a server (or any other human being) would drink out of a stranger's drink. IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?!?!? Especially in the context of a server and a customer. My head almost exploded. I supposed that it is fortuitous that I was intimidated by Antoine because that spared everyone from me causing a scene.  I called immediately after leaving the restaurant/bar. When I asked to speak to the manager, the hostess who answered the phone said, \"Sure! What's your name, Hun?\" I am a doctor and a college professor. \"Hun?\" What year is this?  When I spoke the the manager, there was no greeting on the phone, he just said, \"Zeus.\" It took a few seconds for me to understand that he was actually stating his name, and I wasn't transferred to the wrong number. When I told Zeus the story, his response was, \"So, I don't understand--are you saying that Antoine threatened you?\" Hopeless--these people are all so hopeless. Zeus assured me that he would take our last two drinks off of the bill and tell the regional manager about Antoine's behavior. I am not really sure how that is an appropriate response to this horrific situation.   So, I guess we won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, because my friend has no interest in calling Antoine--she couldn't afford to pay for all of his drinks all night anyway.",

    "text": "When you are in Vegas eating out is a chance to have a one of a kind experience, which is why my mom, brother, and I chose this place when walking through Caesar's Palace. Well, clearly we should have kept walking. The service was not good, I don't think our waiter smiled once during the entire meal, and didn't offer any suggestions, and it took a for him forever to even come over and take our drink orders when we first arrived. Come to think of it the service was slow the whole night.  I won't complain about my meal because out of the three it was by far the best. I got the fish and chips and it was really good, and a huge serving. There were three cod fillets and a large helping of fries. The tarter sauce was probably the best I've ever had. That being said my mom ordered the scallops, and the presentation was awful. They brought it out in a large bowl probably three sizes too big for the amount of food that was in it. There were only five scallops sitting in a broth with carrots. No presentation at all, and for the price of that meal with absolutely no side included it was far from worth it.  My brother ordered the lamb burger and fries, and his serving of fries was about half as much as I got, which was a little confusing. The burger had too many flavors that did not mesh well together. The menu selection didn't offer enough choices in terms of meat, there was only once chicken dish. The drink menu was pretty good, but they were all pretty pricey, and for the amount of wine my mom got in her first glass it was not worth the price at all, I think it counted as \"half a glass of wine\" so it should have been half the price.  The interior was very nice and very \"British.\" Our chairs were arm chairs that you would normally think of for a restaurant but they were very comfortable and made waiting for our food relaxing. All in all I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone, there are so many better places to eat on the strip.",

Had a unique flavor and was worth the $10.  For lunch I had the Pub Burger, I ordered it rare and it came well done and was extremely dry and salty.  And if you are a bigger person, the burger is small.  (Worked out for me, but smaller than one would expect for $20).  The fries that came with it were very good, had shavings of cheese on them, I mostly ate the fries and the burger was not so good.  This place was not horrible, but for Vegas, you expect exceptional food, this was not exceptional.  I will say the staff was very nice.  I think Gordon needs to spend some time yelling at himself for putting his name on this place.  I will not go back...maybe for the bloody Mary, but not for the food.",

I had fish and chips and while the fish was moist the batter flaked off in big slabs every time I touched it--I don't know why this happens with some fish and chips but not others.  The chips were a bit soggy, like they had been sitting for some minutes before I got them.  The mushy peas (they're actually called that) were very good, with a unique aftertaste I couldn't put my finger on, but delicious.  My wife's chicken curry was also good with some zip to it, but no better than what she makes at home.  Service was okay but brusque, they were very busy however and I suspect our server was run off her feet.  My biggest objection was the noise, it's impossible to have a conversation over a meal in a place this noisy, but that is common in Las Vegas where they seem to think a deafening racket is required everywhere all the time.  I'd like to try this place again when they aren't so busy, I might enjoy it more.",

We arrived for lunch and (even though the restaurant was only about 1/3 full) were told it would be a 30 min wait for a table. Huh? We decided to sit at the bar which was packed. We watched as arriving diners were told there was a wait for a table even though the tables near us never filled up. While we waited for our food we asked a waitress why we were told the wait was 30 min when there were so many empty tables that didn't fill up while we were there.  She said they (not sure who that is) tries to \"stagger\" the diners so the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed. She said she hates it because she doesn't make any money off empty tables. I told her I had a hard time believing a decision like that is left to two very young girls pretending to be hostesses and that a kitchen in Vegas run by a world famous chef can't handle a full dining room. CRAZY! Gordon! Don't be a donkey! If you're going to put your name on a restaurant make sure it embodies your customer satisfaction philosophy. Judging by the reviews this place is not doing that.

Stingy portion of barely-warm mash. This is such a simple pub dish, it is a shame it is not done well. Lincolnshire sausages with hearty mash would be so much better.  - No custard option on the sticky toffee pudding. Although good with the ice cream it just feels like the lazy option. Not very authentic for a pub.   The ugly:  - Poor selection of draft beers, especially from the UK and Vegas area microbrews. Mostly standard beers you can get at many bars. The exception is Fullers, and to a lesser extent Boddingtons.  - Everything is seriously overpriced, even for Vegas. Add 50% to what you think is reasonable, and you'll be in the ballpark of what you are going to pay.  - The prices may be justified with fine dining food or service, but you don't get either. You get adequate food and service.   3-3.5 stars seems about right.",

    "text": "I've actually been to this restaurant twice; once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both experiences were exceptional.  The first time I tried Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking for something affordable yet indicative of the reputation of Gordon Ramsay.    I looked the eatery up on the website and decided that a great way to test the waters would be to stop in for lunch.  We had a reservation, but we arrived early.  They sat us right away.  The atmosphere was interesting and industrial.  Large beer kegs lined the walls and pictures of Ramsay scattered the hallway.  There was a punk feel and a deliberately English design with emphasis on reds.    My husband had a burger and I had bangers and mash.  For appetizers we had the soft pretzels and I had the onion soup.  When I tried the English ale onion soup I was furious.  I am a 41 year old woman.  I have been cooking for over 20 years and I managed a commercial cookware store.  I'd like to think I know a thing or two about cooking.  That soup... it was so light.  The cheese on the croutons was so creamy.  My heavy, rich onion soup made with red wine pales in comparison.  The onions were sweet and perfectly caramelized just so slightly.  What a difference.  It occurred to me that that everything I thought I knew about cooking was absolutely 2nd rate.  It also was a portent or the next to come.  Sausages so flavorful and delicate... I was expecting heavy, filling pub food.  I received a delightful surprise.  The wait staff was expedient and attentive.  I was happy with the portions.  I didn't need a take home box at all.      Because of this experience my husband and I went right on Facebook and told everyone what an amazing time we had.  Of course when my cousin was in town for a sales meeting from Boston recently, it gave us the perfect excuse to return.  I spoke of that onion soup all the way there.  I've been searching for that recipe to no avail!  Again we arrived early and again we were seated immediately.  Boy was it busy!  We still had an attentive waitstaff though and my glass was never empty.  Music like Joy Division played and our waiter brought a round of ale.  He asked if we were in a hurry.  We said no and proceeded to work our way through roasted vegetables, smelt, scallops, onion soup, shepherd's pie and sticky toffee pudding.       EVERYTHING was amazing.  It was an experience to savor and although the restaurant was quite busy, we never felt rushed even though we were there for about 2 hours.  The next day I asked my cousin if I could bring some sushi up to her hotel.  She said she was in meetings all day then would fly back to Boston.  I said maybe next time then.  She said next time she comes to Las Vegas we're eating at Gordon Ramsay's again.  Forget sushi!",

The waiter, Taylor, was EXTREMLEY helpful to us in picking out the best entree's to have. I had the Grilled Lamb Burger - YUMM! My husband had the Grilled NY Strip - DELISH!  Our server overheard that we had asked for Ranch dressing and instead of leaving me to use the blue cheese that was brought to me - he brought me a number of options one of which included a cheese dip (which anyone who knows me knows I cannot say no to cheese dip)! Everything was amazing - I cant wait to go back one day!",

After 30 I asked and was told 10 minutes. At this point everyone behind us had already been seated. We ended up leaving so we could get to our show. At 7 pm an hour after giving our name I received a text that our table was ready. Wish we could have tried the food. This is why living in Vegas we stay away from the Strip. Sorry Gordan Ramsey you really are one of my favorites.",

    "text": "Kitchen Nightmares...  For years we watched Gordon Ramsay sweep into a restaurant, point out the inadequacies of the food and staff, whip everyone into shape and leave the owners and patrons happy. Well Gordon needs to visit his own restaurant. We waited over an hour for our food and when it finally arrived it came to the table in bits and pieces, even though there were only four of us. Two salmon dishes came out first and by the time the other two dishes came out, the salmon was cold. Gone are the days when the server knows who ordered what, now it's like an auction. At this price point, with only 4 diners the food should arrive at the same time and the server should be able to figure out the orders. One member of our group ordered the shepherds pie, it was very hot around the edges but really cold in the middle. This is one of Ramsay's signature dishes and it should have come to the table properly cooked. We sat in a booth and the seats were too low for the table, which was uncomfortable. The white wine glasses were very small, not conducive to enjoying the wine...I felt like a child seated at the big table and given a kids glass of wine. Our server was distracted and appeared overworked. Almost everything at Cesare's Palace is overpriced, as is this restaurant, but we don't mind paying if the food & service is good and the seating comfortable...this restaurant doesn't meet the standard of it's owner. Big disappointment.",

The restaurant was busy and bustling and we were seated immediately by John. We started with a beer and an appetizer which came promptly.  The service was professional, yet with a pleasant smile, so very welcome. My husband ordered the fish and chips and i the filet with lobster which came out fresh and hot and timely. It was all so delicious and perfectly cooked and presented.  We were delighted - and thoroughly enjoyed every scrumptious morsel!  We finished with a shared dessert and a chocalatey cocktail, a tasty way to end a lovely meal. Thank you Gordon Ramsey staff for coming through!  We'll be back next time we're in Vegas. The fish and chips get a big thumbs up from me too, as the daughter of an English fish and chip shop owner who loves the real thing.",

    "text": "Met up with a couple of friends to grab a quick dinner.  Just a note - we looked on the Caesar's website in detail at all of their restaurants to find one that wasn't too overpriced since we had a big weekend of eating at nice places in front of us.  I didn't even know Gordon Ramsay had a place in Caesar's, but to my delight, there it was on the list and it had two $$ in front of it, noting it as an average check price of $20 per person.  This was not the case.  An average cost for an entree appears to be about $28.  So I met up with my friends and ordered a dirty martini, which came out perfect.  We ordered our food and started chatting.  We noticed that 30 minutes had gone by and the waiter had not come back and our food had not arrived.  We waved him down and he said he would go check on it.  10 minutes later the food finally came out.  I had ordered the duck confit salad from the appetizer section.  The portion was almost an entree portion, but half the price!  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I finished the entire plate and was just full enough.  One of my friends ordered the roasted chicken, which looked like a tiny whole roasted chicken.  I didn't try any of it but he said it was great.  My other friend ordered the flank steak medium, and it came out medium rare.  She also said it was quite delicious.  We ordered the fingerling potatoes as a side, and those were BOMBtastic.  To my surprise, the side of brussel sprouts were okay (i HATE brussel sprouts).  The ambiance was classy, but not stuffy.  I liked it a lot.  It was fun and just the right amount of loud.  The service was fine, other than the food taking forever, but maybe that's just because it's so new they are still trying to work out all the kinks.  It's also a huge plus my duck confit was only $16 and was such a big portion.  I'd go here again and try the fish and chips.  I saw a couple of waiters carrying that by for another table and my mouth began to water.  They looked phenomenal!",

    "text": "Let me just start by saying that I do not understand the 1 and 2 star ratings. Perhaps there are some disillusioned expectations due to his status as a celebrity chef. Or maybe people are just pickier on the Strip ;)  We went with one of the fixed menu options.  Soup - Cream of Cauliflower. This was excellent. And I say that as some one who normally abhors cauliflower.  The curry oil was a wonderful, warm touch.  Fish and Chips - The batter was delicious and the portion of fish was generous. More then enough food on the plate, I was pleasantly surprised. The chips were some of the best I have ever had. Fresh potatoes and the shaved cheese was super flavorful  Shepherd's Pie - My husband ordered this but of course I had to sneak a bite. Smooth, creamy potatoes. The meat was tender and the vegetables still had a nice flavor to them that was not covered up by the broth from the meat. I am not normally a fan of lamb but this was pretty dang good!  Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding. This was my first time trying sticky toffee pudding but I am now a converted fan. I wanted to take a bath in the sauce that was poured all over the cake and the sweet cream ice cream was fantastic.  Peanut Butter & Jelly Cobbler - My husband picked this based on our server's recommendation (the sticky toffee pudding was her first recommendation but she said this was her second choice since we wanted to order different things). This was way different then any cobbler I have ever had. But it wasn't a bad thing! The crumble part tasted kind of like a crumbled up peanut butter cookie and the filling was reminiscent of black berry jam. The jam was not overly sweet so it wasn't overwhelming at all. We actually really liked it.  The service was attentive and informative. Our drinks never got below half before someone came by to refill. I was nervous after seeing so many complaining reviews but again. After going to the restaurant I really have no idea what those reviews are talking about. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who was visiting or simply wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's food without paying the steak house prices.   We will be trying his Burgr restaurant next!",

I had the prime rib but they forgot to put the beef drippings on the Yorkshire pudding which left me with a partial meal. Mr Ramsay would have had something to say about it for sure.

The concert was nothing shot of incredible by the way, strongly recommend it. We all went to Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill in Caesars Palace for dinner before the concert. They put us in our own private dining room. Now I watch Gordon Ramsay's TV Kitchen Nightmares and he is always screaming at restaurant owners to keep the menu short and sweet and the importance of outstanding food and customer service. It was reassuring to see that his words are not wasted in his own restaurant. The menu, short and sweet. The staff were exceedingly kind, polite, and accommodating. Even the manager popped in to check on us. The food was very good. I wished I could remember the name of our waiter, but in all the hubbub I forgot, but he was excellent. I too, like Mr. Ramsay, expect good service and good food, I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this restaurant, and the concert if you have interest!",

I guess I expected more from a GR restaurant being a huge fan of Masterchef. The waiter was super rude. I placed our order at the bar for take out and my husband stood next to me with our sleeping baby in his arms. The waiter basically yelled at us saying we can't stand there because we had a baby and they would lose their license. First, the baby was in the hallway not at the bar. And second you can just point us to the couch saying we can wait there instead of shooing us away in this extremely rude manner. 5 mins later he came by saying he can take a family picture of us. He did. Then gave us the bill and hovered around so I felt obliged to put a tip - not only is this take out and we didn't really get \"service\" by this waiter, he was also very rude.

He provided 3-4 (free) tastings, recommended an excellent Saison, and even opened a British IPA, poured us some, the people beside us some, and himself some, free of charge.

We had a reservation and were seated immediately, despite the crowd. The service is top notch. My husband ordered a Mocha Martini that was rich and chocolatey. We placed our dinner order and I went to the restroom . By the time I returned all our food had been placed at our respective seats!! Such quick and efficient service. Our server was polite and friendly and made sure we were comfortable all through our visit, which I found lacking at most other places in Las Vegas.  We ordered the Maine lobster and shrimp roll minis as one of our entree, to save space for dessert. It was a well grilled brioche and the lemon- garlic mayo with the seafood was really nice. The butter chicken curry was authentic. It was as Indian as Indian gets! It was served with a flavorful saffron basmati rice , and a fluffy naan bread, with a side of raita ( yoghurt). The bangers and mash was great too!! It nice sized portion with English sausages made of a trio of meats. The gravy went well with the sausages and the creamy mash potatoes. The best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding! If you visit this place, you must try it! It's moist , delicious  and served with a sweet cream icecream. The almond brittle melts in your mouth. The server pours the warm toffee over the dish when it's served. It is so, so good!  All in all a wonderful experience even amidst the Vegas chaos!",

On the show he is a perfectionist, and expects that from his teams, and yes it's a show, but this resto has his name on it and it was not perfection.  My burger was not overwhelming or juicy or delicious. That's what I expected. The truffle chips were actually my favorite here. We did not order any of the British staples like fish n chips or shepherds pie, and that may have been what all the great reviews were for. All I know is I did some major walking and shopping at the Forum Shops in Ceasars so when I saw Gordon Ramseys pub I walked in. I had such a taste for a great burger which I did not get. After posting this review, a GM did message me and invited me to try them again. I was most impressed as this was not a terrible review at all.  Apparently they care about the food they serve and about what customers think. Cheers to that!",

I don't know why most restaurants underseasoned their food, but it was the perfect amount of salt here.   Unfortunately the prices were INSANELY high and I felt so bad for the wait staff.

It was cold in parts, tasteless overall, and super salty on top. Our friends got the bangers and mash and the short ribs. Both were edible, but nothing you would ever go back for. I was completely underwhelmed and ended up needing to get room service later on because I was hungry since dinner was so bad.  The service was bad, too. Super slow even though there were enough servers for the few tables that were occupied and it felt like the waitress just didn't care.  I expected better from the name and honestly feel that's the only way this place stays in business.  Steer clear unless you only want drinks or a burger.",

Came here on Sunday around 1pm because Serendipity was a half hour wait (we should have waited). Got seated ASAP after checking in with waters but it took our waitress forever to get my lemons which she did not bring and it even took a lot longer for our food to come out. Not sure if it was her fault or if the kitchen was backed up but at 1pm the place wasn't busy at all.   I ordered this salmon puree appetizer and it came in a small jar with 6 thick slices of toasted white soft bread. Really good for less than $20 and it was very filling because I only ate about 3 slices of bread. The bread was really good, soft and crispy even when it cooled down it was still really good to eat with the salmon puree or by itself. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me a lot like a lox and bagel without the capers.   My two girlfriends got the lamb burger which they devoured and loved. I didn't get to try it because I don't eat meat but I did get to try the fries that it came with. I love fries so I already knew I would like it but I didn't know I would love it! It wasn't overly salty or oily and it was a thicker slice with the right amount of salt. It was so good just plain and it didn't need the ketchup dip.   Prices are reasonable and it's located in Cesar's hotel right across the casino by the Forum shops. Reasonable prizes and big portions! Just be sure to wait awhile.",

    "text": "Kitchen Nightmare! What a let-down! We had had reservations to come here for a long time, could not wait to try it out. I am a fan of GR and his personal high standards. Unfortunately, every single thing that could have gone wrong here - did. And we are not high maintenance guests. The atmosphere is OK and they had our reservation so things looked alright starting out. It took an eon for the waitress who was on planet Venus all night  to come by and bring us water. We were starving so we ordered right away - the scallops, steak and the soft and salty pretzels to start. We waited and waited and it was busy but not full.  It took forever for anyone to come back around with anything. We got mixed veg side dish brought to us by another waiter. Not our starter. We stated that we had ordered pretzels and then our own server came over and looked like a deer in headlights. I gently reminded her, that she was the one that had recommended them to us and that we had said yes to them as our starter. Sheesh. Then finally, our main courses arrived. Then so did the pretzels which we had lost interest in. 3 tiny sticks for $8 with sickly liquid cheddar and mustard so hot to one's senses it was inedible. And I love hot. The steak was vastly under seasoned. The scallops had a nice sear on them (4 for $32, yipes!)  but the chowder they were on was cold. Terrible thing to serve a chowder cold. The taste was there though. Too much $ for these plates. We had to ask for a steak knife, spoon for the chowder, salt and pepper. Really? No one came around to check on us. To add insult to injury not only were those late, overrated pretzels on the bill, so was the mixed veg starter we never had nor ordered!  Eventually these were taken off the bill after much waiting but I was surprised that a manager had not come by to rectify anything or see what they could do to improve. We paid,  shook our heads and left knowing that the high turn around of customers/tourists  will keep this place afloat but there is no organization here whatsoever, no one seems to give a rat's A$$ and we left a little dumbfounded.  Gordon, you better get back here and have your people retrained!!!  With so many restaurants to choose from for the price, I would look elsewhere. We will not return.",

But then again, he's probably kicking back somewhere in South London drinking a pint collecting the royalties off this mess.  The staff was terrible, it took 15 minutes to get water I had asked for 3 times.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but it's Las Vegas & a shrimp cocktail.  The whole town pretty much has this dish nailed.  I'd suggest trying one of the other 647480 restaurants within walking distance.",

There were pickled onions and swiss cheese on the sandwich as well. Chips were okay but not my favorite. My husband had fish and chips (french fries) and he enjoyed everything very much. The service was excellent. They have a great beer selection that we will try when we return!",

I dont have any thing else bad to say tho, def give it a try if you are around the area.

It still makes me giggle, but that's because I can be childish. ;) The bread pudding was extremely tasty alone, but with the sauce? Fabulous!  I can't eat a lot at once, and this meal didn't get me too full. Each course looked like it would be very dense, but it wasn't.  Our waiter, Ali (I think), was helpful and knowledgeable when we didn't understand what something was or what it was for.",

    "text": "This is the second time we went to Ramsay's. We wanted to go twice to be really get a rating for this place. The first time was for dinner. We go the Bangers & Mash and Shepherd's Pie, two items that a pub should be known for. Both were good, but not great. This dishes are both around $25. We also had the English Ale Onion Soup for an appetizer. That was very good.   The second time, we went for lunch and wanted to try the fish & chips. We had Calamari for an appetizer. This was good.  Please don't go by every ones recommendation on the fish & chips. We went there just for that and we both were very disappointed. $30 for fish & chips, they better be good, but they were not. You were given 2 not very big pieces of fish and not very tasty.  Go downtown at the Main Street Station at the 777 brewery that were 100 times better at better then half the cost.  Bottom line, not worth the cost of the items on the menu. Way overrated.  Really disappointed in a place with Ramsay's name on it, Seriously, walk 100 ft to Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in Caesar's to get a great dinner or lunch at pretty much at the same cost. It is not a pub, but his food is so much better and would rate it a 5 over this 2. If you are a Total Rewards person, be sure you tell them for that big $1 off per selection. Both times they did not ask and had to point that put to them when the bill came, even after making a reservation online and noting our Total Rewards number.",

As we were walking in, we heard a couple sending their food back. My family and I should've taken the hint and left right then.  They don't give you any bread, which for the price of basically $30 a plate I expected some. I got the salmon cooked \"medium\", but when it came, it was not only half the size of my palm but it was also raw. I felt like I was eating sushi. Not worth the price tag at all. My mom got a hamburger cooked \"well done\", but when it came, it was bloody and raw. When she sent it back, it came seared on the outside with the inside exactly the same. It was still raw and bloody. She sent it back a second time and told them not to bring it back. My brother got the scallops that were so flavorless he named it the worst he ever had. My dad's chicken was okay, but the mash potatoes he paid 11+ for were completely flavorless.   The only halfway decent thing I had was some French fries that were supposed to be truffle fries but only had salt on them..... Couldn't properly enjoy them though because both my and my mothers ketchup had strange black pieces of god knows what in them.  Honestly save your money and go to mcdonalds if you want some fries.",

It was worth the whole 15 dollars they charged for it.  We also ordered a couple snacks of truffle fries and brussel sprouts. We had to wait over 20 minutes to get our food, with no updates. I was frustrated enough that I was getting ready to leave, but then the fries were placed on my table without any apology for the wait. As for the fries they were... Okay but unimpressive. I'd do just as well to get fresh fries from McDonald's. The sprouts were a little better with the balsamic, bacon, and I think apricot... But not amazing.  In short the drink was good, the food took forever and was rather unimpressive.   This is particularly disappointing after having eaten at Burgr for similar pricing and having had such a better experience. Given all the options we have in Vegas I'd skip this one.",

Horseradish tasted really watered down.  Service was good, though it did take a little longer than expected for the entrees, especially since our appetizer came out super fast. We also had the \"DIC\" desert. Keep in mind, there's Bourbon in the caramel, so be aware. It was delicious, by far the best part of the Menu.  Overall, for the price we paid two, the Baccanal Buffet would of been a much better value and experience.",

Non stop bum kicks from servants to back on my chair. Food was mediocre at least. Lamb burger come with souse already start separating and half of bun was soaked in butter, definitely this one was sitting for some time, before was brought. Seasoning on truffle frys was ok, however frys it self was cooked in cold oil or was sitting for long time. Make it worse, got food poisoning from this experience, almost got to hospital, no other food was consumed after or 3 hours before. So it was only one source for that. Stay away, better food at Burger King, least fresher.",

I ordered the Salmon which was light and cooked perfectly with crispy skin on top.  My husband order the Steak and Ale Pie he said it was flavorful comfort food.  Our table also ordered the fish and chips, they had a great batter and were light and crispy.  The Shepherd's pie, which is made correctly with lamb and not beef, was tasty and comforting.  The curry chicken was larger than expected and had a good little kick of curry spice.  Lastly we order a couple of the burgers which were cooked perfectly.  The only thing not well liked was the pretzel appetizers, which had an ale cheese that had an unusual but not good taste and a grainy spicy mustard.    Overall we had a great time and will be returning on our next Vegas trip!",

The idea of going down to the strip for dinner was different back then, but it still seems like an adventure. I say how about fish and chips? Ok. Here we go to.... 18 dollars in valet, 30 dollars each in for fish and chips, 22 dollars in a pint each, and there you go. 100+ for an adventure. Was it worth it?!? Not any time soon, do I miss everything I knew about VEGAS? Yes. Good luck tourists! I too miss having a 20 I could gamble also. The food was good, but not that good!

Then then condiments were thrown on the table like the place is a gag diner with comic attitude,, but it isn't.  No salt and pepper on any tables or bar and the food crys out for it. You'll get attitude if you ask for it, and you just may not get it. Only Pub in the world without Brown Sauce.  Expensive, not worth it.  Surly, hostile bartender obviously flying on tweek or other powder. Nothing here folks. Just tourist-trap attitude, sorry menu, high prices, mediocre quality and shot glass size portions. Well cocktail: $16. Look to spend at least $60 to $70 per person plus drinks and walk out hungry.  5 star reviews are from employees.  Go elsewhere.",

The mac & cheese was tasty, and my wife really liked the French onion soup.  In my opinion, it was slightly overpriced, but we are in Vegas so that's to be expected.    The problem was the service.  There was more staff than patrons, so you'd think the service would be outstanding, but it wasn't.  My wife was three minutes from walking out because we hadn't seen a waiter for 10 minutes after being seated (and it wasn't busy), but the waiter finally showed up.  But he didn't go out of his way to be friendly, and we didn't see much of him for the rest of the night.  He finally came and asked if we wanted our drinks refilled at the end of the night, to which my wife said \"just the check,\" even though we really did want refills (but 15 minutes earlier).    I don't mind paying big bucks for good food, or even decent food and good service, but this was decent food and poor service in a city where there are limitless options.  Needless to say, we won't be back unless Mr. Ramsey can class the joint up a little.",

The ingredients were interesting for sure but the avocado dressing brought it all together. The Salmon was my main course and was just as good as the starters. The sauce it was paired with made it very flavorful. The service was on point through out the meal. The restaurant was very clean and not loud, when the atmosphere could make you think different. I would recommend coming back and will for the soup and chopped salad.",

    "text": "As a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I jumped at the opportunity to go and experience one of his restaurants myself. I almost wish I hadn't as it has given me a jaded view of one of my culinary heroes.  When we arrived, we were escorted to our seats and immediately brought water by a very warm and welcoming waiter. The menu was very broad and seemingly had something for everyone. For what it was, prices were a little on the high side, but as we are on vacation, we ordered and that's where things began to slip.  My girlfriend and I both opted for the chicken madras, my mum got the bangers and mash and dad went for the fish and chips. We were all waiting in anticipation to finally try some of Ramsay's British pub classics. The wait, however, was sadly much longer than anticipated. We clocked around 35 minutes sitting talking at the table before our food finally arrived. At this point, the waiter dropped the fish and chips all over the floor. Without a word, he cleaned the plate up and went back to the kitchen. We were waiting for 5 more minutes before our allocated waiter even recognised a plate was missing and no apology was given, simply a \"at least one made it\" when the second dish was delivered.   The food itself was actually delicious from what I had, which is perhaps the only thing keeping this review above 2 stars. The curry had excellent heat and flavour to it and was warm throughout. The bangers and mash were a hit as well, although it should be noted that the sausages are 3 different meats, so if you're not a fan of beef, chicken or pork sausage, I'm sure they would substitute to your preference. As for the fish and chips, it looked good and had crispy batter, however, I had expected it to be more like chip shop style chips from the UK rather than French fries.  I believe this place has potential to be great, but could do with some more training for the wait staff. I hope the next time that Mr Ramsay checks in to this part of his empire that he recognises the need for improvement.",

Nicely done. Since it was a busy week, the restaurant is integrated with OpenTable so you can reserve a table without calling in and waiting.   Food wise, I ordered their lamb burger - medium well. It was nicely cooked with the center slightly pink so the burger was nice and tender. The toppings on the burger is flavourful. But the seasoning on the meat seems to be uneven. First bite it feels like it was not seasoned enough, but when I reach the end it seemed a little too salty. Expected them to mix the seasoning in the meat evenly considering it is Ramsy's restaurant.   Service was a little slow but that might have been due to the CES volume of people.   btw they forgot to give me ketchup for the fries... gave me an empty dipping container...",

Housed in Caesars in a sizable space renovated from Bradley Ogden featuring plenty of wood, kegs, television, and Brit-kitsch it was just after noon when I sat down with two old friends and greeted by friendly, though pushy, service orders were expedited to the tune of an appetizer, a side, three mains, and two desserts - high prices and small portions tempered by a Total Rewards card...at least slightly.  Focusing mostly on signatures and favorites present since the menu's inception dining began with three small but lovely seasoned pretzels paired with cheese and mustard for $8 and progressing to plates proper another trio arrived in the $21 trio of small ramekin-pies, all well prepared but only the lamb loaded Shepherd living up to the high standards set by the exemplary golden cod selected by my friend, soggy 'chips' notwithstanding.  Ignoring the shortrib and what I'm told were vastly overseasoned potatoes while wishing some form of seasoning had graced the flavorless mushrooms it was with sweet redemption that desserts both shined, the rustic Sticky Toffee Pudding every bit as good as the fancy version at Steak and the \"DIC\" a bowl of buttery custard hefty with raisins and aromatics that I'd gladly return for along with a cup of coffee - breakfast, lunch, or dinner.",

Not the greatest option, but I'll take it.  After a half hour or so our food comes out. I got a salad that contained chanterelle mushrooms and spring mix with a vinaigrette on it... that's it. My special salad sucked. It wasn't very special and I ate about a third of it.   My wife had fish and chips and the fries were ok. The batter fell off the fish and was an oily mess and she said the Dog and Duck pub in Austin makes it better... This is supposed to be one of their signature dishes and it was a total fail.  The worst part about it is when you see Gordon on his shows \"fixing\" restaurants he is always watching what comes back to the dishwasher to see if customers actually finish their meals. Neither one of us came close to finishing ours and no one said anything to us about it...   I guess he doesn't hold his restaurants to the same standards as the failing ones that are on his shows.",

Perhaps it was just an off day,  but I think it was just a mediocre lunch at a premium price.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay but I do have to say the food was \"OK.\"  What impressed me was much more than the food...the decor, the drink menu, the waiter/waitresses outfits.    The service was extremely slow however we did not have to wait for a table on a Saturday during lunch time in February.  (I think the waiter had tables scattered all over the place and not in one vicinity).  The food was a little pricey but I loved the display of the food, originality, and atmosphere.  From my experience, almost everything in Vegas is pricey (even more than NYC) unless you grab a burger from McDonalds.     The drink and dessert menu was on an Ipad and gave you descriptions of the drink cocktails.  I got a drink that I can't remember the name but it had Guinness Cream, Boddingtons Ale, Jack Daniels Honey and something else...but all I know it was fantastic and I never drink Jack Daniels anything!  The cocktails were $15 each.  My bf got corned beef in a bread bowl that actually looked good (I never eat corn beef). I got the hamburger which was $19, with bacon would have been $23. All the french fries are 4 huge pieces of potato with a garlic seasoning that come with the meals.    I was told Ramsay had checked in the day before with the restaurant and I saw the head chef walking around.  PLENTY of seats, right in the middle of Caesar's.  It's definitely worth checking out and having a more casual meal than a fancy one in LV.  P.S. Huge Beer Menu as well!",

    "text": "So the winner of season 11 of Hell's Kitchen will be the head chef of this restaurant. Perhaps that is why the restaurant seems to have hit or miss reviews right now. The show finished filming awhile ago so the new head chef has already been chosen, but they can't be seen at the restaurant since that would give away the ending of the show. Having an absentee head chef certainly can't be helping. Even though overall I had a good dining experience, the restaurant was not without its rough edges.  We showed up around 9pm without reservations, but were able to get seated on the restaurant side almost immediately. They put our party of 5 at a table for 4. There were plenty of other tables, but we were told they had all been reserved. Of course they remained empty the rest of the night (we were there until closing) despite a post show rush right after we arrived. This was annoying, but pretty common for Las Vegas as almost no one charges a reservation no show fee.  Our server was pretty awesome. He was funny and really knew the food. Pretty much everyone working there was great from the hostess to the runners. The one big exception was one particularly sour runner. When she brought our starters I told her I did not have a fork and she snapped \"well, then I'll bring you one\" at me. She then brought me 3 forks and four knives. I shrugged this off as maybe a poorly executed attempt at humor. Later on, one of our party asked her for more bread, a fairly common request at a restaurant and one that other reviewers made with no difficulties, but she reacted with shock and began to tell us that wasn't allowed. Before she could finish, she cut herself off and said she would let the server know. Maybe she did, but I doubt it since we just saw her go off to the back while our server was elsewhere in the restaurant helping put some smaller tables together for a big group since heaven forbid they actually seat someone at one of the reserved tables that obviously weren't coming. When they brought out our entrees, she didn't bring mine and asked me what I ordered. After I told her she went to get it and plooped it down in front of me before walking away without a word. I guess that's what I get for asking for a fork.  The food was excellent all around, although the menu seemed too small. We later found out that the menu was once nearly twice the size, but they trimmed it down to just the most popular items. In my humble opinion, they went a bit too far with the trimming. The small plates (appetizers) menu now only has 5 choices and 3 of them are cold seafood items. There were 5 seafood items and 8 meat items (actually 7 since the beef cheeks were not available the evening we dined). There may or may not have been an entree sized salad since the menu did not differentiate them. The most expensive salad was only $4 more than the salad I had as a starter so I don't think it was entree size.  For starters I had the Herb Caesar Salad. The server warned that it came with \"a lot\" of anchovies which I was OK with, but it turns out it just came with one small anchovy. It was a good, if not particularly memorable salad. Another member of our party ordered the smashed potatoes and sauteed asparagus as her starters. They are technically sides, but none of the other starters interested her so she ordered them as starters. I thought the potatoes were good, but the asparagus was just OK for me. Another member of our party ordered the Pub \"Spots\" which are described as sliders on the menu, but the name \"Spots\" is a better description. They were very good, but also very small. You could finish the whole plate in 3 bites. We also had two members of our party order soups which they said were delicious, but I didn't get a chance to try.  For entrees, my friend and I each had a shepherd's pie. Since we were both quite hungry we were a little disappointed at how small it looked, but looks can be deceiving. The little pot they are served in is quite deep and there is a decent amount of food in there. I ended up completely satisfied and can say that this was the best shepherd's pie I have ever had. I also got to try the Scottish Salmon, rib eye steak, and the rack of lamb. All three were delicious. The rack of lamb in particular stood out because I love lamb, but am weary about ordering it in restaurants because often the portions are on the small side. The lamb here is a very hearty portion. Of course for dessert I had to try the sticky toffee. It was delicious. I can see why it is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. My friend ordered the chocolate trifle. We shared both desserts with the whole table and while the trifle was OK, the sticky toffee disappeared far quicker.  So overall I had a great experience except for the one bitter food runner. I could see myself coming back, but unless they expand that menu a bit I don't think I would come that often.",

I had seen this pub at Caesars and wanted to try it because of Gordon Ramsay.  the reviews didn't look to complimentary, but I still wanted to try.   I thought the restaurant was really good.  We ordered pretzels with dipping sauces for appetizers.  They were good.  Three kinds of favors and two dipping sauces.   My 5-year old son loved the sliders and fries. My wife ordered the signature hamburger, but it was built more for a large man with a hunger for lots of beef.  Just ok for a burger. We also ordered fish and chips and the short rib and cheek sandwich.  The fish was really good.  The short rib and cheek sandwich was awesome.  I put some of the garlic mayo on it and it was a fabulous sandwich.  Large enough to fill you up, tender enough to keep eating ! Don't believe the salty comments.  Nothing was salty, we actually asked for salt and pepper. Staff is excellent.  Fries are not that good.  If these are English fries, they should do them American style.",

I kept encountering small bits of shells in the lobster mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was meh. It was overly salty, watery, and not cheesy. The lobster in it was dry and tasted fishy. I had made a much better Costco take home mac n cheese for $10 that fed 15 people a week prior.  I tried the shepherd pie and it was ok....watery but not bad. I told our waiter about the shells and he seemed offended that I was complaining about my friend almost CRACKING/SPLITTING her tooth from eating a small roll. I had only finished half my mac n cheese so I wanted to take it home to add my own cheese and recreate the entire dish. No point in wasting food when there are starving kids in the world. The server ended up throwing out my food. I assumed he was going to box it up since he asked us if we wanted to box up our food and we said yes, turns out he was only directly addressing two people and unfortunately in our group of 6, I was not one of them. He did offer to remake my food (of course begrudgingly and offended that we were inconveniencing him with the shell-bit food that he accidentally threw out). However we were rushing to make a flight home so I didn't have time for them to remake it. For $22, I could have bought 2 Costco mac n cheeses that tastes insanely better and can feed 24 people.  Just sayin...I should have went to Mesa Grill  :*(",

Somewhat disappoint that the sparkling wine listed on the menu was not the one they were pouring...it was Chateau Ste. Michele, which is a good value but only about $8.00 at CVS and naturally it was $8.00 a glass here.  However, the bartender was cool and topped me off a few times free of charge, but I did order 3 glasses...I would have been smarter buying the bottle from the beginning.  Like I said I don't gamble, and expected my guest to turn up definitely by the time I was on drink #2...sadly they showed up when I completed glass #3 and was about to order #4...however, thankfully, husband intervened and comforted me that we have several bottle of this in our \"everyday\" wine stock.  So I stopped and like the intelligent person I am said let's order FOOD! to complete the evaluation of this place. I was only thinking of my fellow yelpers, YKWIM?  So all 4 of us shared sliders and fish and chips.  All of it was Ok, but given that Ramsey is such a hardass, I expected more so much more!  The food did not deliver, but still it was decent.  Fresh, but just ordinary.  if I come back, it is only to sit at the bar and have drinks.   PS.  Whoever won Hell's kitchen needs atleast a few more lessons.  Also the outfits of the wait staff are hideous.",

I haven't been for about 3-4 months but I did go twice only because the first time it was so bad I figured it was a fluke. Not a fluke.

Celebrity restaurants in Vegas are definitely hit or miss and while there were aspects of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill that were excellent, the service left something to be desired. First off -- since the service is what is giving this review poor marks let me start out by saying that our server had zero personality and was seldom seen or heard from. Service is the hallmark of a great restaurant, so even with the best food you can mess it up quickly with bad service. Our server should definitely find employment elsewhere. Now, on to the better part of the review - the food. The food was overall good. The short rib was extremely tender and tasty as it should be and it was atop an amazing risotto and the pearl onions were a very nice touch. The cheddar cauliflower was also very nicely done. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorite desserts and theirs was amazing. Cocktails were also great. Prices were high for what it is. I don't mind paying and you do expect to overpay on the strip, but this was a bit much. So, up the ante on service and you'd win me back -- not sure I'd give it another try based on what I experienced, however.",

    "text": "This is REALLY sad, because I actually came here a few months ago (back in January) and really enjoyed it then (I would've given it a 4/5 then), but after the experience tonight, I had to lower it :( I'm a HUGE fan of Mr. Ramsay, and when I had first eaten here, I was in love with all the dishes! I had never had fish and chips that good before!  After today, though, I don't know where I'd get those fish and chips again :( I went in today not knowing that just about 4 weeks ago, they changed the menu around and some of the recipes (I asked the waiters/waitresses about it). The fish, which before were perfectly sized, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, was now giant, thick slabs that were dry and overcooked. The batter, which used to be crispy but flaky to the touch, were now thick and hard. The fries, which used to be thick but crunchy, were now dry and burnt-tasting.  I did have other dishes, but nothing that was better than average. The majority of the dishes I ordered last time were no longer on the menu after the menu change, so nothing to compare (those other dishes were GREAT the first time I visited, though!).  The waiters/waitresses were quite nice though. To be fair, the place probably deserves a 2/5 stars now, but after that overwhelmingly disappointing decision to change the recipes and menu so drastically, I had to give this 1/5...I'm so sad.",

    "text": "Allow me to begin by saying thank you Mr. Randy Goldich.  Saturday night 2 of my friends and myself decide to eat at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Gril.  The ambiance and food was exemplary.  Yes I said it, my GOD I never had nothing that good not even a home cook meal from grandma house or momma house.  (smile)  However; that nite we had serve that was  not well but the night ended excellent.  2 of us had ceasar salad and the other young lady and the fish chips and it was divine.  Our waiter never check on us or even asked if we wanted any dessert.  Well we called the manager over and we just feel in love with his warmth and sincerity.  He was just a blast in which we could have stayed longer just talking about life and Mr. Gordon restaurant.  Then the bartender came over and grab my hand and we went to the kitchen and thats when I smiled from ear to ear seeing Mr. Scott  from hell kitchen  the man in action.  Oh my is the only thing I could think of at that moment. As if that wasn't enough Mr. Goldich invited us to come back as his guest the next day and it was a perfect fairy tale for us knowing it was our 1 and 2nd time there in vegas.  It was a perfect ending to a 2 day stay in vegas and we owe it to Gordon Ramsay and the staff.  Starting with Mr. Randy Goldich and the perfect hostess Saturday and Sunday nite and my bartenders Sauturday nite and finally to our server on Sunday.  Yes I forgot her name but she was beautiful and nice and absolutely a perfect waitress who take her job seriously.  Thank you to all and please know you made dreams real for three women from Detroit, Mi and Sacramento, Ca.",

The atmosphere was inviting, the waiters and waitresses were nice, and the food was great. We didn't wait long, even with a bit of a lunch rush, and the iPad thing for viewing and picking out drinks and dessert was interesting (a bit confusing at first, but our waitress explained it to me quickly). If I go back and have a friend, I would totally take them to this place for a lunch. The beer-battered fish & chips was a bit sweet for me, but generally good. The chips were cooked well and the smashed peas tasted nice. I had a specialty drink (forgot which one) but it was great as well - enough alcohol to make me happy, not too much to overpower. I may also now be a fan of trifles after the one I had. Perfect amount of chocolate to make it sinful, but not overpowering.   ...also, I want the waiters and waitresses outfits. they're awesome.",

When we tried to order a second round of drinks (light beer, not liquor) we were told we were too drunk!  When we asked to pay for our drinks and leave they tried to charge for the food which after 40 minutes had still not arrived.  When they finally brought the bill for the drinks only we were attended to by numerous staff, something that had been lacking all night.   So many better places to eat in Vegas. Don't go for the flashy celebrity name. Go somewhere with a good atmosphere and friendly service instead. (And where they don't charge $24 for shepherds pie. Ground beef and mashed potato - seriously?!?)",

I even asked the bartender if they are informed when people decide to eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table and was told no, they still would call you. Dinner was mediocre at best. My sliders were over cooked and very dry. My boyfriends scallops were decent but I guess we expected better for the cost. Beers are WAY over priced even for Vegas standards. Their signature dessert was the best part. Bartenders were friendly and personal. We both agree we would not eat here again.",

    "text": "Oh Gordon....where to begin. I've looked forward for so long to try this place out and the best way I can explain it is to think about the Price is Right song when people lose on the show......yeah exactly.  We were in Vegas for opening weekend of the tournament and originally had reservations for Gordon's steak house but after conversing with our bartender a couple days prior he mentioned that pub would be better suited for a larger group. We arrived for our reservation after seeing Seinfeld and were seated promptly, after that its ALL DOWNHILL. It took over 20 minutes just to get water! When the server finally came over he looked confused and to be honest a little pretentious.  I would have expected this from his steakhouse but not the pub. Anyway we put in our appetizer order, calamari and shrimp cocktail, which came out in piece meal again not seeing our waiter this entire time. I will say the shrimp cocktail was the best part of the meal (that's why they received a star) but the calamari left something to be desired. Two people in our party ordered the prime rib and after specifically asking the server how it was given the time (it was 10pm) he noted that it was perfectly cooked and good to go, however what they received was a tough gray log. I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out medium....at best, it was definitely more gray then pink. My one friend might have had it right just ordering a chicken sandwich!  All in all, I was very disappointed by this place and can say that I will not be going back. The things that Gordon prides himself on, service and perfectly cooked food, were surely lacking.",

My wife is a big, long-time fan of Chef Ramsay and especially Hell's Kitchen, and was excited to catch a glimpse of Chef Christina Wilson, the season 10 winner. A few minutes after being seated, we were treated to a visit by Randy Goldich, who introduced himself and seemed very interested in us and our Las Vegas trip. Randy brought Chef Wilson to the table to meet my wife, which obviously went over great!  I'm in the music business, and we had a great conversation. All of our food and drinks - beginning with the Scotch Egg - were amazing. The fish and chips are truly a masterpiece. Mr. Goldich invited us to return later after our Billy Idol show, and we had a great extended visit. Thumbs up to Chef Ramsay, Randy, Christina, and the whole staff!",

Her attitude was similar to a person that just got hit by a bus and then ran over by a steam roller.  If you get this server, RUN away..  She made me so mad I just ended up leaving.

My friends and son surprised me with a reservation here and my son flew in from Los Angeles. All a surprise. Food was ok, nothing to write home about. But what was so disturbing was the customer service by the managers and the waitress It was terrible. They over charged us, and we didn't see it until we payed the bill and that's how we felt they did this cause we had a group of 7 and they thought we would not notice.  It took forever to get someone to give us attention. Management (randy)did not try to do anything to defuse the the situation. It was so bad my son got upset not only because of the charges but it was my birthday, then they called security, instead of fixing the situation they call security but then the check was still wrong and while security ( Michael) was there they agreed, the bill was wrong. The incompetent waitress was to separate the bill five guest on one check two on the other she didn't do that so what happened , they charged the bill completely for seven people with tax and  gratuities when it should've been for only five because the waitress didn't separate the bills. This will be our last visit. We spent over $300 and this is the service you give. I will make sure I pass on this experience.",

    "text": "First up i want to say that everyone that knows me knows that i am n love with Gordon Ramsay, with that said here we go. We go to Vegas every month been trying to decide between his steakhouse, burger or pub. We figured we would do the in between so went with the pub. Just went Dec. 23rd so it wasnt crowded at all. Got seated immediately. First up the tables r too low seats very  uncomfortable. Our waitress took forever just to come over and take our drink order which was just 2 sodas. Very small menu so that made our choices pretty easy. Now mind u its 7:30pm i havent eaten since breakfast bcuz i wanted to make sure i would b able to eat my meal and end it with a great dessert.  Me: Had to go with the fish & chips of course bcuz thats all Gordon talks about, with a very heavy heart i must say i was not I'm pressed a matter of fact i was disappointed none of the dishes were flavorful. The only difference btween this fish & chips and HSalt fish & chips was it wasnt as greasy.Thank God they give u such big potatoe slices bcuz the fish pieces were small.  My daughter: shepards pie n this tiny bowl, which she had to salt and pepper, but she did love it.  My other daughter: braised lamb shank: shallow  bowl/plate the lamb was very tender.   Maybe if the meals came with a soup or salad or if they had some bread or something on the table u wouldnt realize how long it takes the food to come out. Once again we do splurge every few months on a fancy place and i dont mind if the total experience makes me say i cant wait to come back here, that didnt happen.This meal set us back $105.00 and just was very average. We went to the Chocolate Box and had some delicious dessert.  Now, i wont b back here to eat but i will at least try his other spots.",

Our server, Christopher was fantastic, and he and his assistant, Mehdi, were both prompt, full of humor, and very attentive.   Christopher had several recommendation but when my wife and I were both interested in the Fish and Chips, he suggested that we order one with their dessert add on special and share. We agreed and added a mixed green salad.   The salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go.   The sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share.   This is Las Vegas and everything was pricey but for the value of the food and the experience and the absolutely amazing service from Christopher and Mehdi, this was probably the best money we have spent so far on our trip.   A fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.",

We had Michael who was a fantastic server, very professional, kind and seemed to check on us at the exact right intervals. The water is pretty delicious, and comes in a unique bottle.  The draft beer selection could be better, but you can't go wrong with a Dogfish head IPA.  I would suggest asking your server for food suggestions, they really know what they are talking about, and also if your into splitting your meal with your date it might be a good idea to taste different dishes.   I had the lamb burger which was delicious and I highly recommend you try it.  This is a very unique dining experience and it is a must do if your in Vegas.

I had a sample of hers and thought it was quite good.  Second visit I had the short rib. Wow wow wow as Gordon would say. So delicious. We also split the calamari app. Was done in a unique way but was excellent. My husband had the bangers and mash. It was very good.  The only thing that I have a gripe about is the prices of the beers. But whatever. If I like my meal, I don't care what it costs. If you are on a budget, perhaps this is not the place for you. Also, if you come here why on earth would you order a burger? You can get a burger anywhere. I read lots of complaints about the burger and the price of it. Duh... No burger should cost $20 and if you come here, why not get something that is not so common?  One downside is the service was on the slower side each time I've been here, but I make reservations and allot 2 hours just so I don't feel rushed. I like to take my time to eat.   Give it a try, look at the menu before you come to make sure it is in your budget and you don't go on yelp later and complain. Also, make reservations, plan accordingly. Order something a bit out of your normal realm too. Complaining about burgers and fish and chips....you people....smh.",

By the time our waiter came over, I decided I wasn't going to order a drink and just get the bare min. I ordered the classic fish and chips and my wife ordered the butter chicken curry. Food was good, came out unusually fast. The waiter barely made small talk. I think he knew we were both upset about the service.  Being local, we might have to start picking another go to place at Caesars. Disappointed, it's been awhile.

Pub & Grill was actually my first Ramsay dining experience and it totally hit the spot.  Caesars Palace is a busy place, and Pub & Grill's central location on the casino floor makes this restaurant a really busy place too. On a Tuesday evening around 8p, we were quoted a 45 minute wait for a party of two. Ugh. Too hungry for all that, we scoured the bar for a couple stools and luckily found a spot at the back end. We squeezed-in near the drink pickup station, so it was definitely a busy spot. Even though the restaurant was buzzing, we were promptly helped by both a bartender and server. Overall service was quick & friendly-enough.  The Maine Lobster Roll Minis are super tasty & ideal for sharing since they are plated in pairs. The Shrimp Cocktail's also great - six massive prawns perfectly poached and served with a delicious horseradish-spiked cocktail sauce.  Vegas can get a little stuffy when it comes to dining, so turn to Pub & Grill for a casual, delicious meal.",

The Scottish Salmon tasted like re-heated below-average wedding caterer salmon. It had no flavor and a level of dryness that could only be achieved if the fish has died, like, multiple times until it reached a zombified state. (This shouldn't be the case if you're paying over $30 for a piece of salmon.)  The Sticky Toffee Pudding was also a bit questionable. When I first had it in 2015, it held its shape and was served with a neat, spherical scoop of ice cream. But this time, the cake portion was super loose and sloppily put together, topped with an amorphous, melty glob of ice cream. I wondered if they had smashed this dessert against the wall before serving it to me.   The Poutine was probably the best item I had this time around. Even though the fries were way too salty and the corned beef strips had the texture of rubber bands, but the fries were nice and crispy, and the cheese and gravy they used were tasty.   However, for a meal costing me over $70 (with no alcoholic drink!), it was not worth it and I probably won't be running back any time soon.",

    "text": "Yes, I know they specialize in steak and signature dishes, but I decided to go with the English cheddar and bacon burger. It was cooked to a perfect medium. This might be the most flavorful burger I have ever had the pleasure of introducing to my tastebuds. They were accompanied by amazing truffle fries. This burger was perfect and worth the $$. We started with a white cheddar and garlic Mac and cheese appetizer, also delicious. My wife had a delicious flavorful NY strip, also cooked to a perfect medium.  We finished off with his famous sticky toffee pudding, which was simply divine.  Everything about this place was 5 stars. The service was absolutely superb and the food was even better than I imagined it would be. With all the let down restaurants we've experienced in Vegas, this was the perfect turn around for us. I love this place and I will come back every time I'm in Vegas.",

Well at first it was supposed to be just some small appetizers and a few drinks before we started gambling. However it all changed once we had a chance to look  at the great menu. They have an awesome hoot hour where you can get some delicious chicken wings with \"real blue cheese\" and warm pretzels .   Great stuff, now on to the \"meat and potatoes\" of the menu. My better half enjoyed the fish and chips which were stellar and I had the famous Beef Wellington which didn't disappoint. We topped it off with the Toffee pudding dessert t seal the deal .  Lisa R was our server and she was friendly, suggested items from the menu, fast and always had a smile. Great experience overall for a couple of locals shaking it up mid week  Cheers to the staff , cannot wait to go back!",

We hit the place early, just before the lunch rush so we managed to avoid the crowd.  Nice place, classy atmosphere, and pleasant service staff.  So many things on the menu we would've like to have tried, but my wife chose the Fish and Chips and I got the Shepherd's Pie.  Both were as you'd expect from a Gordon Ramsay establishment....amazing, but pricey (not quite as wallet-breaking as Ramsay's other Vegas venues though).  If you want to try Gordon Ramsay cuisine but don't want to have to mortgage your house to do so, try here!  A great experience.....we'll be back!",

We were in the area for dinner and our next event for date night is nearby.  Atmosphere - By having a reservation we actually were seated at a booth for four people.  Two people made it nice, we still sat close together.  The place is big and has a lot of little sections but the volume in the place is loud, too loud.  Also a lot of TVs with the World Series game on.  Food   Drink - I had the classic Dogfish 60 Minute IPA on draft, 20 ounce pour.    Appetizer - We ordered the deviled eggs.  Described with sriracha and bacon bits, the sriracha was lacking.  We were expecting it in the egg yolk mixture or a drizzle.  Even without the sriracha the eggs were great.    Dinner - I had the flat iron steak with a side of truffle fries.  The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare.  The menu did not indicate this but the steak has a little bit of mashed potatoes and a few veggies.  I mean a few, a baby carrot, an okra, and a pearl onion.  Service - Out waiter was good.  The busy boy would never let our waters get even close to be empty.  Future - I could see coming back here.",

We decided on a late lunch bite, something quick to hold us over until later tonite.  We ordered the appetizer, this burger slider item which came in a pair, actually very good other than having slight to none dressing. It would have been better if the dressing complimented the beef, but i hardly tasted it. The bun was a little chewy. We also ordered to share, the fish and chips platter, it wasn't all that bad. I know....how could you mess up fish and chips. It did take forever to come out, maybe 20 minutes after we finished the appetizer. I didn't think it was too complex of a dish to prepare. The batter was crisp, had some flavor,  fish was slightly generous, came with potatoes wedges, and this minty pea dip concoction which I really didn't care for. I'm no Gordon Ramsey, so maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about. I'll try the other dishes in the future and hopefully justify get what I'm paying for. But hey, this is Las Vegas.",

A couple of us tried the beef Wellington - and quite honestly - being a Ramsay signature dish (and $60 each) We were disappointed. The meat was barely warm, and a bit dry,  the pastry not flaky. The meat was dry probably because the pastry was super soaked and mushy. The accompanying sauce was very tasty as well as the potatoes.  We also had a couple orders of fish and chips. While the chips were tasty and hot, the fish was flavorless, like the seasoning was missing.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and each other's company.  I do hope this was just an off night - we were there on a Friday at 6:40 - and others that night were not disappointed.",

The lobster Mac and cheese was overpriced given the small portion and very little lobster. Seating is ample and the dress code is casual with nice modern decorations (kegs along the wall are great for pictures).   The server was really attentive although some of his jokes fell flat and made things a bit awkward (like we were helping him with his comedy routine). However, the service from the hostesses was really poor because I arrived 5 minutes early to my reservation as was told to wait for my table to be ready. It turned out that the hostess never checked me in and she only realized after I asked her because I saw at least 5 groups of people behind me get seated and we were the only ones waiting.   I must admit we wanted to try out this restaurant because we are big fans of the Hell's Kitchen TV show so we were expecting this restaurant to be a tourist trap and the experience confirmed it.",

I ordered the signature tasting menu  Appetizer/ Scallops (10/10) Amazing sear, and the flavors are just there although it's very simple but it's a blast.  Entree/ Wellington (10/10) Always been craving it from the TV, but once you taste it. You can tell why it was so hard to achieve in Hell's Kitchen. It's perfect. Sauce and cook was on point.  Dessert/ Sticky pudding (6/10) I'm not a fan of a pudding but it's tasty.  Must to visit.",

The first time I came here was for cocktails at the bar for \"Pub Hour\" between 2:00 - 5:00 PM on weekdays.  Pub Hour (their happy hour) includes half off all draft beer and select wine, as well as pub bites under $5.  This was a really good deal, and the bartenders were the bomb, friendly conversations and excellent service.  The second time we came here was for drinks and dinner.  Couldn't decide what to order for a starter, however, the Maine Lobster & Shrimp Rolls came highly recommended.  My \"starter\" was really good, creamy, delicious.  I'm glad I ordered this.  For my main entree, I had the Braised Short Rib.  The ribs were so soft and tender I didn't need my knife to cut it!  For dessert, I had the Apple Tart, which was accompanied with a caramelized puff pastry and salted caramel ice cream.  It was really delicious, and a nice close to my meal.  I highly recommend these dishes.  Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill is a nice \"feel good\" place for cocktails at the bar or dinner with friends.  They have a nice selection of craft beers, wines and specialty cocktails.  The bar/pub area has flat screen TV's showcasing a lot of sports games.  Our hosts, waiters and servers were very accommodating, energetic, lively and entertaining .  Will definitely be back next time we're in Las Vegas!",

I already had reservations to Hell's Kitchen but the bachelor party group I was with wanted to check this place out. To my surprise they offered the beef wellington, I confirmed with the bartender that it's the legit serving and same as what I would receive at hells kitchen.  I have wanted this dish for so long and have thought about making it myself, so much so that I have watched lot's of Gordon's youtube videos and his Masterclass episode on how to prepare his famous beef wellington. I know the ingredients and what should be encased in the puff pastry and I could be wrong but didn't find parma ham or dijon mustard, both necessary ingredients. I also thought my filet was just slightly overcooked but didn't want to send it back because everyone I was with just got wings so I was already late.  The size is small, compare it to a taller hot pocket, and the plate was huge. Most of the plate was empty space or sauce. I think a smaller plate would make the portion seem larger. When they bring it out to you it's already cut it in half and covered in clovers... I kinda wish I could've cut it open myself. Everything else was good, I liked the drinks and everyone's food looked great. Just was not satisfied with my entree.",

The burger was juicy, a little pink with the perfect amount of flavor.  The pig in a blanket was a nice size bratwurst wrapped in warm flaky dough. At $1 per wing,  it was a slightly sweet tangy flavor with blue cheese for dipping.    Whopping $25 for the shepherd's pie,  it was a decent size, filling and had a good amount of protein. This is not a cheap meal, if not for happy hour tasting menu.  I took some pictures, and a video of the dessert to add to my review.    To top everything off,  the Yelp check-in offered free toffee pudding.  The pudding was surprisingly moist and the vanilla bean ice cream made it that much tastier. Ending with a free warm toffee pudding was a nice perk.",

The first thing I would like to point out is that our server was fantastic. He helped me pick out a beer that I actually enjoyed and gave good feedback on which dishes we should try! I ordered the Beef Wellington which was delicious. We also ordered Calamari for our appetizer and the pickled peppers really made the appetizer taste amazing. Then to top off this amazing experience, we asked a different waitress to take a picture of us standing up for my birthday and she took us to all of the best spots in the restaurant to take our picture and didn't even act like we were invading her time! This place is fantastic and we will definitely be back.",

The atmosphere is cozy with dim lighting. I enjoyed sitting close to the open window so I could people watch in the casino.   On the first occasion, we had deviled eggs for an appetizer and the shrimp and lobster rolls with truffle fries. They were outstanding! They look small but I was completely satisfied.   The second occasion, we had the sliders! They were legit the best sliders I ever had. Just wow! We also tried the 16oz New York Strip steak. It was to die for! And the plating was so beautiful! Wouldn't expect anything less from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   I checked in and earned a free dessert. Sticky toffee pudding--which I did not think I would enjoy but I sure did! It was delicious! It was absolutely amazing!   So excited to come here in a couple months and try something new!",

So I didn't order the Fish n' Chips, but my friend did and said it was \"Fine\".  I'm sorry, but in my opinion, $30 Fish n Chips should be the best Fish n Chips of my life!  I got the Mini Pub Bacon Burgers.  What a disappointment! The single miniscule slice of bacon barely covered a third of the burger, and I could barely see any of the aioli.  The burger was plain and boring.  I've had better burgers just about everywhere.  As a side I got the calamari.   It was good, but nothing spectacular.  So I give it one star for service, which was wonderful, and one star for drinks, which were delish.  I can't give it any more stars than that.  Will most likely never be back unless I'm going to the Colosseum and every other restaurant at Caesars has shut down.",

We had a table of 5 for a 10:15pm reservation. We were seated promptly and had our orders taken. Our soups seemed to come out at a decent time but we didn't get our entrees until at least 50 min after that. In that time I had lost my appetite from waiting so long. The restaurant occupancy was as expected for a Thursday night but not all the tables were taken. Maybe the kitchen was short-staffed, I don't know. I would have given 1 star because you shouldn't lose your appetite while at a restaurant, but my fish and chips were pretty good. However, they were not good enough to make me come back and wait that long (or pay that much again) for them.",

    "text": "Pretty standard gastropub fare - large beer selection, decent food, busy staff who just want to turn your table.  We arrived around 915p on a Tuesday and was told by a snarling hostess that it was 30 minutes.  Not the best start to the evening...but I thought the SMS system was cool - leave a number and they text you when the table is ready.  Got myself a Strongbow cider to go with the bread and pretzel.  Came with butter and some odd cheese sauce that didn't really do any justice to the pretzels.  Still, the caraway seed bread was tasty.  We started with crab salad with pickled radish and corn soup to share.  Crab salad was very good, lots of crab meat - though I wouldn't say the little bits of crab bones/shells were any good for the texture.  Suppose it's hard to get everything when there's that much crab meat.  Corn soup was kind of plain, even with the minced crab in it, and didn't have enough corn kernels to call it corn soup - unless it was pureed...then I just didn't taste it.  Wife had mussels and clams.  Was an enormous pile of them.  She was salivating when I was taking photos, but a few bites in she thought the broth brought out too much of the fishy taste in the shellfish.  Most chefs would use some butter, sake, or wine to cut the fish taste a bit - not here.    Needless to say, she didn't finish the dish.  I ordered the shepards pie.  After watching GR enough on tv, I'd figure I'd try his signature dish out and see what the hype was all about.  One of his biggest peeves about the pies he tries is the amount of grease in the dish.  Well, his kitchen staff must have missed those episodes, because my pie was chalk full of grease.  The meats in the stew itself was nice and tender, albeit a bit bland; but with the mashed potatos soaking up all the grease, the dish got to be really heavy.  Texture wise though, the dish wins 5 stars - creamy mashed, chewy meats, and crunchy vegetables makes for a texture dream.  Waiter asked how things were at the end and we started into some of the things above; but as he was tuning us out the moment his question was finished, we didn't bother to go into much detail.  We had hopes of bringing a visiting friend next week, but in the end, we decided on two things -- not to get a dessert as to prolong the staffs evening, and not returning for another visit.   Good night.",

    "text": "Well - I only write reviews in 2 instances:  1. the food and/or experience was totally awesome and would warrant a revisit.  or 2. the complete opposite - the food and/or experience was dismal and disappointing.  Sadly GR Pub and Grill was the latter.   I am a huge GR fan and was very excited in trying Mr. Ramsay's inspired menu and experience his detail to service. We arrived around 1:15pm for lunch and waited for a few mins while waitstaff cleared a table.  The restaurant was only about 1/4-1/2 full (at best) and yet we still had to wait about 10mins before a waiter poured our water and asked for drink orders.  I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it was waaaay too heavy on the rum and was not served with lime.  To the server's credit - he was very apologetic - rushed to get me a second one.  #2 Dark and stormy was slightly better (less rum)  but still a sub-standard drink which did NOT warrant the $11 price tag.  Again not served with lime - I had to ask for them.  Not.a.great start.    So I thought 'ok -we are not here for drinks the food should really speak for itself'. We ordered the deviled eggs per the waiter's suggestion plus I LOVE deviled eggs. I was so psyched to see them on the menu.  I have been known to eat 8-10 in one seating but I digress. With all Mr. Ramsay's emphasis on simplicity - it was lost on this dish.  I thought it was interesting mix of flavors on paper but in reality there was too much going on between the vinegar, bacon and cheese.  Weird texture too with the bits of bacon. The worst was that the egg whites were too firm - like they had been sitting in the fridge for too long or were just pulled out and were not given enough time to soften a little. And the yolks simply did not taste fresh.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by farm fresh eggs.  Nevertheless I was disappointed.    Ah but the entree should be better - right?  Nope.  My lamb burger arrived cold.  Cold fries and cold burger. WTF?! Not only did we wait approximately 15-20mins for the entrees to arrive but the my entire meal was cold.  COLD!  Again the waiter was very apologetic and rushed a second burger out to me.  So this one was warmer but sadly it had absolutely No.taste. None. Could not tell it was lamb.  In Mr. Ramsay's words: BLAND!.  It was not seasoned.  I've had better tasting lamb in the local middle eastern restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I cannot speak to my mother's dish because it contained gluten but she said her heirloom tomato sandwich was quite good.  So there was one bright spot.  Then again she admits that she really does not care about food e.g. tastes, flavors, experience as much as I do.    In conclusion, I had very high expectations for Mr. Ramsay's food and restaurant.  For the prices he charges I should have been WOWed.  Instead I left disappointed and very unhappy.  I do have to mention that the watier was thoughtful enough to offer a 20% employee discount which brought our lunch total to $59.02 but still a pricey sum for a sub-standard-will-not-return-to-lunch.  I would not recommend this place.  Sigh.    Happy Dining, KK Teh",

    "text": "Strange - i thought i posted a review of this place a few months ago ...  .As to this particular review, being the romantic, for Valentines Day i gave the girlfriend:  Diamonds ?  uhhhh No Perfume ?  Seriously ? Flowers ?  we've been together 3 years, I've yet to give her a flower so why start now. Candy ?  getting closer  How about two tickets to the Uncorked Dinner with Chef Gordon Ramsay since I think she loves him more than me ?  What can i say, I'm a giver.  So even though it's a special dinner, it is being prepared by the chefs that work at the pub and you figure, it's gotta be there best effort since Chef Ramsay is there riding their ass so i've opted to make this a review of the restaurant and not the event.  briefly, as to the event, they simply cut off a portion of the restaurant for about 60 diners.  Chef Ramsay made the rounds - pics autographs, etc.  My gf was gushing when he came up to our table - i jokingly told the chef he can grab my girls ass when i take the pic.  I gotta admit, the guy is personable - i couldn't resist - asked him about this so-called riff between him and Bobby Flay - to his credit, didn't miss a beat and explained that it's \"press-driven\" - he likes Bobby, thinks he's a great chef, blah blah blah.  Overall, A nice event.  What about the food ?  All the courses were paired with beers provided by Innis & Gunn  Course one -   Chilled Fennel Soup with Shrimp paired with I&G Original.  If I wasn't told it was fennel soup i never would have guessed fennel was in the soup and I'm a fennel fan !   Smooth, creamy, but it needs ... flava !  The beer was decent.  Course two - Heirloom Tomato. Goat Cheese and Chervil ( paired with Original again )  - believe it or not, the star of the evening - simple fresh the classic flavor explosion.   Course three - Pan seared Diver Scallops, braised artichokes, spring garlic ( paired with Original ) - nice, simple really like the artichokes.  Course four - Grilled Rack of Lamb, olive crushed potatoes, baby zucchini ( paired with I&G Finish ) - again, simple yet full of flavor and the beer was amazing.  The GF had a hard time with the rareness of the lamb - good, more for me !  Course five - Sticky toffee pudding ( matched with Melville fruit beer )  - for this being his \"signature\" dessert and i've seen rave reviews about it,  I can't lie - didn't care for it.  i actually was surprised what it looked like ( never had before ) - to me it looked and tasted like an upside down bran muffin.  I was expected a little jug of toffee sauce to pour over the muffin and ice cream - i guess not.  I simply didn't understand the dessert.  The beer had a fresh berry flavor to it - not bad, just not sure it complimented the dessert.  Overall, I thought it was a decent effort with the theme being fresh, quality ingredients that were not stifled by seasoning.  Most importantly, the GF was very pleased.  pics attached",

They had a great selection of micro brews on tap, a good enough reason in itself to stop by.  The deviled eggs and warm pretzel were awesome.  Unfortunately, our meal left a little to be desired.  The fish and chips were average, but plentiful.  They overcooked the first burger and felt it necessary to make a second one. The problem was, they forgot to tell us about the delay.  It was close to 40 minutes before we got our food.  By then, we were a little pissed.  Not a good idea to deliver food late to a Yelper.  Sorry Gordon, I really had high hopes.

So we gave it a shot today. We got right in on a busy Saturday but our food took quite a while to come out, our appetizer (pretzels) came after our meal, our side of fries didn't come until we reminded our server, our drinks were never refilled, and the food was just ok (except the lamb burger which was awesome). I had the fish and chips. It was good, but not $30 good. Anyway, they were super-slammed and the waiter was apologetic, but we won't be back.",

Our waitress was attentive, enthusiastic, and made great recommendations. We had the shrimp cocktail, pub sliders, beer flight, a bloody Mary (a meal in itself!), truffle fries, and the sticky toffee pudding. We enjoyed our late lunch so much, we came back for dinner to celebrate our anniversary, canceling our reservation at another restaurant at Caesars. For dinner, our waiter, Christopher Lee, was fantastic and our food was delivered so fast, we were pleasantly surprised. My compliments to the staff...not only was everything we had delicious, it came to our table piping hot, and we felt so well cared for by the staff. Definitely try the sliders, truffle fries, bloody Marys, fish and chips, and the sticky toffee pudding (save room and make sure to share the pudding!) We will be back the next time we hit Vegas and also plan to check out the steak house at Paris!!! Well done.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is the word of the day for Ramsay's Pub and Grill.   As a beer lover, I was most excited about the beer offerings at Ramsay's Pub and Grill, which was supposed to have 36 beers on tap, and another 63 in bottles. I make a point to seek out new brews where ever I travel. The quantity of the beer selection at Ramsay's Pub was the sole reason my girlfriend and I made the trek for dinner that night.   I was disappointed to find out that they do not have nearly this amount of beers for sale. They still have plenty (about 30-ish), but I was hoping to find something new, or perhaps a hard to find ale from when I used to live in London. If you visit hoping to drink some great craft brews, you will be let down. They stock the usual big brands, nothing special. Unless, of course, our server with-held some secret menu that contained the rest of the beers advertised on the website? I asked about this but was told everything they had was on the menu. :-(  As for the food, it's Vegas prices. High prices, almost too high for what they offer. I had the Steak and Ale pie, which is a staple of hearty pub food in the UK. But at $24, I suppose I expected something more than the underwhelming pie I received. I didn't think I would have to spice up a Gordon Ramsay pie with HP sauce... I've had better from UK chains like Fuller's. My girlfriend had the fish and chips, which were good, but still very expensive ($28) for what it is.   Again, I understand it's Vegas and prices are inflated, but it just seems like too much for the food they offer. They can advertise it as \"elevated\" pub food, but in the end it's still just pub food and doesn't justify a $75 bill for steak and ale pie, fish and chips, and two drinks (a full draft pint is anywhere from $9-$13).   I originally gave it 2 stars because of high prices, generally underwhelming food, and missing beer. But, the food wasn't bad, just not worth the high prices. The place does, however, have a great vibe. Lots of fun, but I would reconsider dining here again. For the price, there are better options. In fact, hundreds of options! Maybe I'll just grab a brew or cocktail at the bar next time.",

Amazingly creative sauces, freshly baked bread, mouthwatering shrimp salad...  Who mixes beer, horseradish and mayo and sells it for $12? Only a genius! He lures you in with the delicious teasers and then ...boom. Your trout is tasteless, fish and chips Denny's style, shepherd lacks zest... the beef cheek was really good and gentle but that is about it. I was digging for water in the dessert, but honestly out of four dishes, three were not even worth it. My Armenian in-laws could not even finish their dishes nostalgically mentioning that there was much better food half of this price in Bellagio's buffet. Of course, in another life I will totally come back and spend at least $500 on the rest of the menu just to check it out, in case of my punitive reincarnation into this very pretentious Saudi borehole owner.",

I had to return it and ordered lobster mac and cheese where it had big chunks of lobster but came out lukewarm.  The whole experience at this point was horrible but the manager comped us which was nice and im glad he did or i would give negative stars. Popularity of this place is because of mere location Inside ceasers. Meh. If you must go order the burger. They do have happy hour on the weekdays.  All in all not impressed.",

My wife got the brusselsprouts and said they were the best she ever had.  The sticky toffee pudding is a Gordon Ramsay classic, and it did not disappoint. One of the best desserts I've ever had. We hit it up back to back days because it was that good.   Definitely recommend this place!

I loved the decor and mood of the whole place. It was in a hotel, like most of the restaurants.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'd love to try another one of his restaurants.",

What I though was nice was the noise level for being off the main casino it was quiet enough to have a conversation without shouting.

I didn't expect so many for the HH item and was pleasantly surprised. Not a fan of the mustard sauce because I dislike mustard but for me, the dogs were fine without them. Love it.   The slider was good as well, although you really do just get a tiny little mini-burger. Paired with the nachos, it almost is enough to build a full meal portion.   Check in for the toffee pudding while it lasts! Comes topped a la mode with a healthy scoop of French Vanilla, and the caramel poured over the top was seriously like the perfect food video ever. We were in a rush, so the server let me to-go most of it after polishing off the ice cream on top.  Very solid choice for a snack, but didn't pay attention to the dinner time pricing so not sure if I'd want to visit for that instead~",

    "text": "Came for a rare night out, this was our first visit to the Pub although I have walked past them hundreds of times leaving work. Sat at the bar and were greeted with menus. The bartender came back after a minute and asked if we were ready, and I asked if they had any of their own beers (I know it's not a brewery, but Wolfgang Puck has his own wine and so figured does it hurt to ask?) to which he replied, \"no, we're not a brewery\" and walked off. Fine, maybe the guy gets asked that all the time, but as a bartender when people ask me for the fivehundreth time the same question I always hear, I respond in a pleasant way because maybe it's their first time at my bar and it's my entire job to make them feel welcome.   He seemed to change his tone a little when he carded us and saw we were locals. We started with the Lobster Mac n Cheese. $25 for the dish, it was large and visually appealing. The macaroni flavor was the most pronounced of the dish and I kept looking around to see if there was salt I could add to give it something. There were about five or six lumps of lobster, which was alright. Overall nothing impressive. Next the Fish and Chips, and the Scallops. The fish and chips was served with a side of ketchup, tartar and some green mint-like sauce which I still don't know what it is because the food runner didn't explain anything about our dishes, and the one or two times the bartender came by he didn't ask us how everything tasted or offer to explain anything. The fries were steak-fry style and decent. The fish was moist. The tartar sauce was extremely dill-forward, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  As we were eating I couldn't help but notice the thirty or forty dish towels on the bar floor soaking up what is probably old Caesar's building plumbing faults, but speaking from experience it really is not a good time to have to bartend while you're standing in an inch of water. The management staff should really handle their plumbing issues.   The Scallops were incredible. Perfectly cooked and paired with a sweet corn sauce on the side. The succotash it was served with on the other hand tasted like something I could get in a high school cafeteria. But really, those scallops were probably some of the best I've ever had. $42 I believe for four half-dollar size bites of heaven.   Looking over the dessert menu and two older white ladies came and sat at the bar. The same bartender who had given us blase service suddenly became the most friendly and interesting individual to them, making jokes and formally introducing himself and his co-workers. We left without dessert.",

Interior: I like how you can get away with jeans and a T-shirt or a dressy top and heels if you want to dress it up a little.  Entree: Curry w/nan bread and mint yogurt dipping sauce. The meat is so tender and melts in your mouth! If the curry starts to get too intense as you keep going for more the nan bread and mint yogurt dipping sauce will help aid in relief and giving you a more refreshing note!  Desserts:   sticky toffee pudding was Amazing love the texture of the sponge  caramelized vanilla pudding w/ orange zest cookies. I enjoyed it but it was quite boring if the cookie had more orange in there maybe it would've been more exciting! I did however enjoy the creaminess of the brulee.",

He was friendly and offered information about the menu without being overbearing. He checked on us, made sure we were happy with our meal and remembered us when he saw us walking by the pub a few days later. He's a good guy who is an added bonus to any staff.

However being a vegetarian my only option was salad according to my server but I'm glad I noticed Mac & cheese as a side and asked if I could just order that as my meal and I'm glad I did because It was delicious! Other Gordon Ramsay restaurants are more vegetarian friendly so maybe skip this one if you're a vegetarian who likes options.   Service was quick and friendly, the only thing I will say is we got quoted a ten minute wait time for our table and once it had been 20 minutes and we noticed people who came after were getting a table before us we asked about the status and they told u there was a mix up and someone else got our table. The issue was rectified right away but I would've preferred if no mix up happened in the first place.",

Our waitress was on point, she did great recommendations and my drink never went empty. The food, was 100% delicious. Appetizers perfect size and balance to the meals. We had an egg type appetizer, it was flavorful and unique, not something you can get anywhere.        Our burgers of choice was lamb and Hell's Kitchen. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, first of all the texture was so soft everything melted like butter in your mouth. Perfect cook, perfect amount of ingredients. The mushroom fries are also a good choice.  The best part of our meal was honestly the dessert. Best desert. The signature sticky toffee pudding left me speechless  The price in reflection of food was worth paying for. Beside the wonky table, I can not wait to try the steak house next:)",

While its food selection is more well thought out than most generic bars and pubs for food, it's not the bomb dot com that you might expect from the big name. (Sorry Gordon! I still love watching your youtube cooking videos though).  We came here as our consolation being too late to be seated soon for Bacchanal. The menu was pretty cool with a lot of grill favorites with a unique Ramsay twist. The servers were enthusiastic about the menu and all made reasonable recommendations.   I got the lamb burger and french onion soup. The burger was pretty good I guess but the cheese really overpowered everything. As for the soup, I think it was fine as well. The cheese is good but I didn't come away from it thinking it was amazing or anything. I feel like I could find something like that on par at TGI Fridays or something.",

The noise level from the casino made it difficult to hear the staff when seated up front. The food was good - nothing to blow us away as we'd hoped.  Overpriced given all over experience and expectation built from what Gordon's media brand he's built. We wouldn't return sorry to say.  The biggest surprise was the overall poor condition of the dining room furniture.",

The appetizer came out pretty quick but the drinks took a while. When they did come out though, they were pretty good. Maybe not worth the almost 20 mins wait, but the atmosphere was still vibrant enough to distract us.   We got the sliders and the Goodbye Blue Sky. The sliders were really good and the arugula added a nice touch to cut through the grease. The Goodbye Blue Sky was very fresh, and the blackberries on top were a great touch and very sweet. We got both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic version. The non-alcoholic was made with ginger ale which was an upgrade from any soda why could have used. The drinks were a bit on the pricey side but this is Vegas and Gordon Ramsey's' restaurant so it makes sense.",

    "text": "It was good. Not phenomenal, not outstanding, just good.   We dined at Pub & Grill on a Sunday night around 6pm. The ambiance could be improved. The music was much too loud for the setting and made it feel like you were at a loud bar, versus a $250+ meal. The service was for the most part good. The two waiters we had were attentive. No complaints there.   The food was alright. We ordered prime rib, short ribs, lobster rolls, poutine, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, smores shake and the famous sticky toffee pudding. The real stand outs were the desserts. Comparing Pub & Grill to GR's other restaurants, I feel there is much tastier food at Steak and Burgr. This was a comp'd meal for us, and I'm happy we didn't use much of our own money to pay for it.",

We had a table looking into the casino which was kinda cool to people watch.  They bring fresh rye bread and pretzel sticks to the table with a cheese dipping sauce. I was disappointed in the sauce due to some sort of horseradish taste to it. I didnt even really get to taste them because before you knew it the food was out at the table.   Ordered fish and chips..you definitely get a good portion of fish which I thought was good.T he potatoes were ok . I prefer smaller fries these were 4 giant ones with a little parm on em. Again all dipping sauces included horseradish. YUCK!    Overall not too impressed ..lets hope the new chef who wins hells kitchen can help. LOL",

On the first visit I had the Ramsay's Tonic (a decent drink, but a hefty $15 price tag), and the Shepherds Pie. The Shepherds pie was delicious.   For the second meal a friend and I shared the meat plate, which was pretty tasty, just enough for a two person appetizer. I had the bangers and mash, and he had the chicken. The bangers and mash were ok, the gravy was pretty delicious, and fortunately not over-salted. My friend liked the Chicken but didn't finish it. Several other friends showed up and all had the NY steak, which none of them were particularly fond of.   My friend and I had two drinks each, the meat plate, and the two entrees. The total was $141.00...OUCH.  Service was decent both times, but the food is just too expensive to justify eating here. It just wasn't that good. If I'm in Caesars again I'll be eating at MESA for these prices.",

I started with the English onion soup. It needed salt. Badly!  On the waiters suggestion I got the butter chicken. It was ok, but lacked flavor. The chunks of chicken thighs in it were kind of big and stringy.   My companions had burgers, which were average. You can't really screw those up too bad.   The best thing that we ate were the fries. I'm a French fry snob and am very picky. These fries were great!",

And as others have said, the service can be slow.  However, there were some positives. I made a reservation via Open Table directly from Yelp for 10 pm for after the Elton John show at the Colosseum. We arrived at 9:30 and were seated right away, even though there was currently an hour wait for the person in front of us. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on going.  As as others have said... OMG the sticky pudding! It is a must, one of the best desserts I have ever eaten. Definitely share with others to avoid sugar overload, just a few bites is enough lol.  If you want to experience a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, go to Burgr at Planet Hollywood. I haven't tried Steak at Paris yet, still trying to justify their prices for a single meal lol.",

We sat at the bar and I have to say Ray Ray was one of the nicest most genuine people we have come across in Vegas.  Total asset to the restaurant.  We are so pleased we stopped in. It is a bit pricey,  but not unreasonably so and the quality was there to back it up.  Ignore 3 star rating which I think is because some folks are hoping for food court pricing.

The GM contacted me to apologize, explained that he would be working with his staff to rectify my complaints and, offered to have me come back so he could  make my next experience a better one. I was taken a back and thoroughly impressed by this; it says a lot about this business and how they represent themselves.   Almost 6 months since my contact with the GM, I reached out to see if the offer was still on the table. And on March 28 I had an amazing 40th birthday filled with great friends, incredible food, wonderful sevice and a restored, impressive experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grille! I went with no expectations and told my friends they might send out a special appetizer or dessert, but they went above and beyond my/our expectations! Our server talked about the menu and  answered our questions expertly, the drinks were delicious,  the appetizers and main cooarse were incredible (I suggest the lamb burger!!!!), and the dessert was UNBELIEVABLE; sticky toffee pudding with one of the most delicious house made caramel sauces all of us had ever had! Then to top off our experience we got to meet the winner of Last Year's Hell's Kitchen, Scott Commings! I'm embarrassed  to say I cried, I was so over joyed!  Aside, from all the generous things done for us, I have to say I cannot wait to go back to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grille the next time I'm in Vegas. It truly is a great restaurant with traditional pub food that is made expertly with a presentation that sets them apart from many restaurants. You can tell they take pride in every thing they send out. I highly recommend you visiting this restaurant when you are in Vegas, and don't forget to get the on tap Guiness and sticky toffee pudding with house made caramel sauce!",

    "text": "4 stars mostly due to the cocktails and beer selection at this Pub.   I am not sure if Chef Gordon realizes what he has going behind the bar but between Adam Rains (also the beverage editor of Las Vegas Food and Beverage Professional magazine) Adam O'Donnell (Voted best bartender in Vegas by Vegas Seven and Bols Bartending Academy) Raul Faria (Host and creator of Mixology Made Simple), Ray Ray, Gene and a few others, this \"pub\" has created a great cocktail program.   While I have had the pleasure of being served by almost everyone above, I have had the most experience with Adam Rains including on this most recent trip.  Adam is one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met when it comes to cocktails and spirits in general AND food. I have a feeling that if he had chosen to be a chef he would have been as equally skilled as he is with spirits.  He has a collection of house made infusions and bitters that he uses as tools to create some very unique, next level cocktails but can also make you one of the best classic cocktails you've ever tasted as well. I had one or two cocktails listed on the menu but I was entirely comfortable just asking Adam to shoot from the hip and make me something unique. Every cocktail was a success. I did have the \"God Save the Queen\" off the menu and it was pretty tasty, everything else was a Rains original I believe. I go here for the cocktails, the food is secondary to me but I have never had a bad experience.   That being said, I have never had anything bad here, it's just everything seems so heavy. I know I know English Pub fare. I'm not flaming the food but we normally just get smaller plates throughout the course of the night at multiple restaurants and would like to see lighter options other than salad. They did  add a couple of lighter option since my last trip, the lobster roll being one of them. It was delicious, light, sweet, savory, one of the best lobster rolls I've had. We also had the wings which were wings and the pub sliders that were pretty good although we were sad to see that they changed the recipe for their deviled eggs though. The last incarnation were the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten.   In the end, it's a great place to grab an early cocktail and a snack as they open at 11am and while I have never had anything truly amazing off the food menu it's definitely worth a stop if you want to try a Ramsay property without spending an arm and a leg or if you want to have an amazing cocktail.",

I was hungry, so we ordered calamari and a salad for the table to snack on and I ordered the lamb burger.  The calamari and salad were just average and nothing to write home about.  But the lamb burger was fantastic.  The meat just juicy and savory, with just the right amount of gaminess to remind you that you are not eating a basic burger.  The goat cheese melded really well with the burger as well.  The french fries were thin and dull, and got cold pretty quick.    So the lamb burger is a 4.5 star meal, while everything else was 2 stars, so I ended up giving the place 3 stars.  I was also disappointed that the lunch menu only had about 4 sandwich options.",

They don't serve the pork belly anymore (which used to be incredible), the service is now AWEFUL, and the food is borderline edible in some cases (I'm not joking - out of 6 of us eating only one of us found our food acceptable).  It was so terrible, that I will never step foot in one of Ramsay's restaurants again. You can be a jerk on your show if you are amazing, but Gordon - your restaurant sucks. Knock off the act, quit selling out, and fix your terrible restaurants and the associated business model.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love Gordon Ramsay.  Hell's Kitchen is still one of my favorite reality shows and his steakhouse in Paris (the casino) is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere in the world.  All that said, I was woefully unimpressed with his Pub & Grill in Caesar's.   Given that we love GR, this was initially an easy pick for lunch after it opened in Caesar's.  The menu looked promising, and if it is GR, it has to be good, right?  Sadly, no.  Not even close.     The wife went with the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips w/ Mushy Peas ($30) and got a single, small, bland fish patty and what seemed like frozen french fries.  The peas were cold and off-putting in both flavor and texture.  All for the bargain price of $30.  Gotta love Vegas, right?   I ordered the Chicken, Kale, and Bacon Pot Pie ($24) and honestly believe that I've had better chicken pot pie from Marie Callender for 1/4 the price.  There were actually more vegetables than chicken, and it needed salt.  The pastry was dry and flaky, not the least bit buttery, and didn't do much to compensate for the lack of flavor in this dish.  I am so disappointed...even still.  C'mon, GR; you are better than this!   The main thing that salvaged a 2 Star rating was the service and the ambiance.  Our waitress was super fun and really made it feel like we were in a pub in London.  Other than that, and the wishful HOPE that a GR establishment can't possibly be this bad back-to-back, I likely won't give this place another shot...there are, literally, hundreds of other options in Vegas.",

    "text": "I never really give places two starts, but with here i went in with very high expectations and was completely disappointed. I'm a huge Gordon Ramsey fan iv seen all of his shows, I watch all his YouTube food tutorials, so of course i was so excited to finally eat at one of his restaurants. When we first arrived we were seated immediately which was nice the hostess though did have some what of an attitude which was already a bad start to the experience. It took about 5 minutes then the bus boy came over and served us some waters. About another five or so minutes the waitress finally came around. She recommend appetizers and told us what entrees were the most popular which was nice she was also very friendly.  We ordered the pigs in a blanket for the appetizer. As for the entrees I ordered the 14oz rib eye medium rare with a side of cream of spinach. My boyfriend ordered what was recommend by the waitress which was the shepherds pie, and our friend ordered the braised brisket i believe is what it was called it was also recommended. The appetizer took probably around 30 minutes to come out, it came out about 2 min before our entrees came out. I will say the appetizer was pretty tasty it only came with 3 pieces though so one for every person. When our entrees came out the presentation was pretty good so i was excited to taste mine and everyone's at the table. My steak was cooked perfect and the flavor  was spot on no complaints on the steak. As for the cream of spinach it was okay i felt it lacked a lot of flavor. I'm not a fan of lamb but i did try the shepherds pie it was okay i definitely expected a lot better because it was so highly recommended. As for the braised beef that was probably the worst one it had absolutely no flavor almost tasted as if it was just boiled in plain water. Overall it was just a big disappointment especially for the price we paid i expect a lot better for high end food. I will say the desert we ordered i'm not sure the name but it was by far one of the best things iv ever tasted ever i would return here again only to eat that desert again it was amazing. This was also my birthday dinner so again it was just a horrible way to end our trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I don't like posting negative reviews because I believe the majority of what goes into the culinary arts is subjective since it's weighted so heavily on taste, but my experience here warranted it. We dined here Tuesday night I believe, I ordered the oven-roasted Scottish Salmon with a side of mashed potatoes and my husband ordered the grilled lamb burger. Unfortunately, there was no real flavour in my salmon dish, and the lamb burger came with a block of goat cheese which just dwarfed any other flavors the lamb burger may have had. I'm no expert, but that seems like such an amateur mistake to make, not knowing how to balance flavors.   In addition to that, service was incredibly slow although they did try to make up for this by getting another waiter to get us started with drinks. As an aside, the tap water that they eventually brought to our table had an odd taste. Initially I figured maybe that was what tap water tastes like in Nevada so I didn't think I had cause for complaint, but after a more pleasant experience at another restaurant in Caesar's Palace, I know that this clearly isn't the case.  Calling this place overpriced would be an understatement and what we ordered was so devoid of flavor that this whole experience can, at best, be summed up as spectacularly underwhelming.  I left the restaurant supremely annoyed at the less-than-average dining experience offered at such premium prices. Certainly not worth the 70 bucks for two that they charged, in my opinion.",

On the downside: the calamari was tiny and insubstantial, the deviled eggs unimpressive, but the biggest disappointment was the chicken curry dish. If G. Ramsey were to go into one of his Restaurant nightmare charity cases and be served that dish he would have unleashed an expletive laden tirade and screamed, \"take it away,\" all the while going through his retching and gagging histrionics. It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste at all! Unbelievable that anything so devoid of flavor could stay on a menu.   Stick with a Wellington and a glass of Red.

I checked out Pub on Thursday for my first Gordon Ramsey dining experience.  We sat down and had Heather as our waitress (and she was amazing!) I asked about Hells Kitchen and Heather told me that one of the former contestants worked there and was there working that night.  Heather went above and beyond and arranged for us to meet Kristin (how cool!!) Kristin comes out to the table and talks to us for a bit and then takes pictures with us!  Everyone was so amazing and helpful all night.   I didn't even mention the food and drinks yet! So there were four of us there and we weren't super hungry so we decided to go for a few different shared plates.  We started out with the nachos - I was thinking \"how good can nachos be, and what kind of special twist can you put on nachos...\" But at Pub they were amazing - the chips were a different twist and really brought it all together!  Then we had the pigs and a blanket which were hands down the best pigs and a blanket I've ever had!  I want to talk about all of the food I had but it was all just to amazing!

    "text": "This is actually a 3.5 Star Review (come on Yelp you really need to expand our scoring options these days).  I had to choose between rounding down to 3 or up to 4 but I used my city-judging tie breaker and gave them a 4.  I've had my heart set on coming here for a while.  Then I started reading the recent reviews and few had something positive to say. However, I really wanted to judge for myself and give a fair assessment.   All thing a considered during the experience, here is how I landed at 3:  - Upon arriving, greeted by 3 possibly unhappy hostesses? 0 smiles given and a very bland \"enjoy your meal\" after seating us.    - Hospitality - 0 points - It's non-existent from the entire staff, which I would be making a much bigger deal out of if not for the fact that this is A: A Gordon Ramsay Establishment and well, hospitality isn't his M.O. and B: It's still Vegas where money and beauty trump all other things.    Food - We didn't eat anything bad.  But only the Chicken, Kale and Bacon pot pie stood out as a \"wow\" item.  Portions are small and it's kind of ridiculous when you consider the cuisine.  I'll pay $12 for truffle fries but you should be able to share them, not ration out a few fries to a table of 4.  Last I checked a 50 pound bag of potatoes was still $11.  Prices - this goes against everything I believe in but I'm going to go ahead and complain about it.  $30 for Fish N Chips Gordon? No one at the table even ordered them and I'm pissed off about this.  Again, noting that the portion on it is barely enough to feed 1 person and you're using Cod, not an expensive fish.    Service - not to be confused with hospitality, which there was none of....they do the job they need to do.  Water was always full, appetizers and entrees came out quickly, no mistakes on the orders.  Our server made no attempt to enhance the experience though.  Made no suggestions, didn't offer dessert which is a shame since I had already picked out what I would have 2 weeks prior and was pretty excited.    Atmosphere - It's a beautiful pub and very swanky.  Being located in Caesars Palace kind of makes that a requirement.  There are certainly a hundred much better options on the Strip but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try this place.  Just taper your expectations and be willing to overpay for what you get.",

The lettuce was not fresh-it was wilted under a great deal of dressing. There was one piece of shrimp and 3 cubes of chicken. The meat was definitely not freshly grilled. The croutons were a disappointment as well (all three of them). The salad looked like it was made a week ago. I didn't finish it. And what's worse is how expensive the meal was.

I did not mind paying higher price for the food, but super disappointed with food quality.. Probably you can get a better quality food in any casino buffet. This is the place to go if you are full and just want to show off that you ate at Gordon Ramsey's!!",

I admit I first visited because of Gordon Ramsay (who wouldn't? :), but the food is tasty! I've had pub appetizers one visit, and then the salmon for dinner on another - no disappointment here. If you're at a conference at Caesars (like I was), definitely add this in to your lunch repertoire!",

Once to order our drinks and meal at the same time (we had enough time to look over both since she didn't come to our table to take our drink order for 20 minutes), and another when we got our bill. The drinks and meals were delivered by runners. We came here an hour before they closed on a Friday night. I had the Fish and Chips paired with an Innis & Gunn, which the menu noted as Ramsay's favorite. I really didn't think it was anything mind blowing. I have been to Burgr (also owned by Ramsay) and I LOVED it. I would probably not eat here again or recommend it only because I expected so much more because of the name attached.",

I also had the Scotch egg and had sticky date pudding for dessert - both were very nice and worth the price - again just not the same.  So in summary excellent menu unless you're an English person looking for a bit if the old country.  One more thing I sat at a table with high back chairs. The chairs were comfortable but it feels too low compared to the height of the table.",

We had to ask for a table in front of a TV so that we can watch a basketball game while we eat dinner. They were very cooperative and sat us after about 10 minute wait which we didn't mind at all. Their bread selection was very good but their french onion soup was very very salty. I understand they are supposed to be served a bit salty, but wow. it was really salty. I enjoyed my fish and chips while my husband drooled over his beef stew. The beef stew is really soft and it'll literally melt in your mouth. Bread pudding is good but it was a flavor I expected. But overall, we enjoyed our dinner. They have great beer selection. Decent price level for it being a restaurant inside a strip hotel.",

We were placed at a low table. We asked for a different table and got attitude again. We stated that a member of our party was pregnant and couldn't even eat comfortably. That is why we made the reservation. We finally got a high table. Hostess kept giving us the stink eye. A member of our party ordered the bacon burger medium well. It was more like raw. It was sent back. Another table sent their burger back for the same reason. I will never return. Bad service and raw burgers = no return service",

Sevice: This is the second of his restaurants I've visited. When I returned for a second go the waitstaff remembered me by name! :-)  They are all wonderfully entertaining and attentive gentlemen! I advocate eating at the bar.  They are talented, too! Describe the flavors you're craving and voila they will make or recommend something delicious.  2. Food: Need I even comment given my caveat? I have had the: Scotch egg, heirloom carrots, Queen Vic Curry crisps & the chocolate triffle.    The heirloom vegetables are amazing, savory and just the right texture.  No floppy, flaccid carrots here!  The triffle is a snowballing surprise.  It is like consuming a chocolate cloud.  The tiny cookies served beside it hold multiple mysteries themselves.  As you can see I did not try an entree. I must share that a side and appetizer or a side and a dessert are plenty filling.  Plus,  I'd already been to BurGR so I wanted to try things that were new to me.    3. Ambiance: Fun and relaxed even on busy evenings. I don't think any sourpusses are allowed in here! Furthermore, I found myself seated beside Englishmen who were endorsing my selections.    Any future Las Vegas trips will include a visit here!",

It was a bit too late for the two little ones so we showed up early in hopes there might be a table.  They offered to seat us in the bar area up front but later on when I passed by the main dining room on the way to the restroom, I saw tons of empty tables. :/ The bar seating is fine for grown ups but tough for little ones due to the height & no backs.  Service was great here. Food was okay. It is pub food & not meant to be high end frou frou. I tried Ramsay's high end restaurant in Hollywood thanks to DineLA. I LOVED the food there.  I got the Hangar steak with fries here at the pub but thought the steak was under seasoned (for my taste). But it had great beef flavor & was tender. Fries were ok.  I tried a bite of our friend's fish of his fish & chips (the fries that came with the burger at our table & my steak were all the same.) While the fish was not super moist, the batter was amazing. I'd get the fish & chips were I ever to return. They give you a lot of food with this plate!  Overall, the food is simple but for the price, lacked a little something....extra. I guess you're just paying for the name Gordon Ramsay.  One other thing to note....this is more a Harrah's thing than Ramsay's thing but photographers go around & take pictures of your table & then mildly try to pressure you to purchase the pictures after they print them. What's funny is they photoshop a picture of a pixie sized Ramsay standing on your table. A bit odd!",

We stumbled across this place on our way to the casino and decided to give it a shot since it was Gordon Ramsey's place. The place was packed and very noisy, and there would have been a 20 minute wait if we decided to sit in the dining area. We then decided to sit at the bar where we were free to seat ourselves.  I can't comment on the dishes here, but the \"Nachos\" we ordered were out of this world. I actually thought they were actual corn nachos, but they were in fact kettle fried potato chips (English style I guess) with a sour cream sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and red chillies on top. All I will say is, it was so so so hard to stop eating them! ...yes, they were that good! Together with a glass of wine or an ice cold beer, this'll make an excellent pub snack.  Service was good and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Definitely a nice buzzing place to get together with friends.",

Ramon, an awesome bartender who went way out of his way to create an amazing bourbon drink, shared with us some of the cool insider stories that understandably has led to a terrific camaraderie here in the restaurant.  Staff is all pleasant, energetic, friendly and really love what they do. Easy to understand when you hire right and inspire the best.  Ok, enough of the overkill, but seriously this place is a lot of fun. Good British Pub food with the master touch of Gordon Ramsay.  Definitely check it out if you come to Las Vegas and consider sitting at the bar if you're solo or just the two of you.  Awesomeness.",

Perfect thing to start off dinner. My husband got the lamb burger and I got the braised short rib. They were both really tasty!   Dinner was about $100 including tip. Not bad for Vegas.",

Sat at the bar, which has full menu service.  Got a scotch egg for an appetizer, the brown mustard on top definitely opened up the nasal passages, but it had great flavor.  Had to get the fish and chips for my main entree, after all I was in a pub!  I was expecting the fish to be more like I was used to, strips of fish deep fried, and for there to be 4 or so strips.  Instead what I go were two large pieces of fish, cooked to a nice golden brown.  The fish was excellent and not too greasy, the chips on the other hand were a soggy mess.  They came out over cooked for the most part, and with a burnt oily flavor to them.  I was sadly disappointed in them and didn't even finish them all.  The two bartenders behind the bar gave great service, always ensuring I had a full drink and seeing if I needed anything else without being too overbearing.  Overall I would say I will give GR Pub & Grill a second chance, but may just steer clear of the chips the second go around.",

I had the Braised Short Ribs, which are very meaty and cooked pretty well.  It was a big piece of meat, which was good.  The cut of meat was kind of chewy though so disappointed for the price I paid.  Taste wise, the ribs were pretty good.  I left the sides, they weren't that awesome.  I also had some wine and a Guinness beer.   The restaurant was extremely loud so it was hard to hear other people talk.  So overall, I would say this place is very overpriced, the decor is cool, the food is not bad but ok overall.  Bring your wallet, it's Vegas.",

While this was a great idea in theory, it still took 40 minutes to get our food and we ended up eating quickly and dashing out to make the show. It seems the food for other tables came out within 10 minutes of ordering before and after ours hit the table, so maybe ours got caught up in a rush...  Food was average. Had the chicken salad sandwich and fries. There wasn't a lot of chicken salad and it was just okay. The fries were better. The other thing we got was the pub sliders and a side Caesar salad. Each of those were solid but not mind-blowing.  Service was friendly. Seems like it could be a cool place, but just didn't hit all the marks for me.",

I was walking around in the bellagio and i decided to cross the bridge to come here for a late dinner. Since i was a party of one again, i was ushered to the bar to have my dinner.   I ordered a fish and chips, it was supposed to be a \"classic favourite\" so i assumed it should be good. Boy i couldn't be more wrong. I also ordered a innis and gunn which was supposed to \"pair well\"  with the fish and chips and was \"gordon's\" favourite.   The fish and chips came in a bowl shaped plate on a piece of fancy tracing paper. The fish and chips were nicely done. The huge chunks of cod were very very fresh(gotta give it to them) and cooked perfectly. However, without the tartar sauce and the lemon, the fried fish was disgustingly plain, the fried batter came off the fish completely and i was eating fried batter separately from the fish. \"the entire plate was so oily, that the USA is deciding to invade the plate\" was how i felt after eating this 30 dollar dish.   The innis and gunn did its job, the only 2 reasons why i could think of why it paired so well with the dish is because it washes the grease away from your palate, and if you have enough glasses of this beer, you would probably get drunk enough to forget you had paid 30 bucks for a disgusting, oily plate of cod fish, fried batter and chips.   I was so disappointed by my experience at GR pub and grill i didn't even post it on my facebook. I do not recommend this restaurant for a first date.",

I've learned not to always judge a book by its cover so I still decided to give this place a try.   We went to dinner on a Sunday evening. Made reservations around 7:45p and this place was pretty busy.  My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio Pesto Chicken Sandwich-it's a cold sandwich by the way. Also ordered truffle fries. He enjoyed it. I had a bite and it was pretty good.   However.....I ordered an 8 oz burger, the waiter asked if I wanted cheese...I declined. But when the burger arrived....the burger was just a plain bun and the meat. I was thinking...okay...that's odd. Maybe these fancy-smancy restaurants make their burgers like that. It was plain and boring. Yes...I get it. I ordered a \"boring dish.\" But sometimes, a good restaurant can turn the most simple dish into something that will tickle your tastebuds and leave you wanting more.  We decide to ask the waiter what happened to the condiments. Where's the lettuce...tomatoes...onions...etc? He told us we were supposed to order that if we wanted it. -__- ugh. Thanks for your help, waiter. You were such a helpful guy. *insert sarcastic tone here.* So remember..FYI...IF you ever order the burger here, make sure to ask for veggies!!!!! What kind of restaurant don't automatically give you the lettuce to your burger? It's like ordering a chicken pot pie without the chicken.   Also, the price for what we paid was NOT worth the quality of the food. $17 for the pesto chicken sandwich and $18 for a plain ol tasteless hamburger. Disappointing. I'm never coming back here.",

Since the group wanted a more casual dining experience, we decided to try the Pub & Grill. Sadly, I was not very impressed.   We had reservations for a Sunday evening. I was disappointed when I saw that we were being seated at a table that was right next to a busy bussing station. It was not comfortable, and it was loud.  The noise made conversation difficult so it felt like we waited a long time for orders to be taken and food to arrive.  Service in general could have been a lot more friendly and attentive.   I had the Shepard's Pie . It was fine, a good sized portion, but not something I would recommend or rush back for. Prices are high, even for for the strip. I think I'd be more likely to overlook food that was just average if the environment had been more comfortable.   I'm still a Gordon Ramsey fan but for me, the Pub is a pass.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my Gordon Ramsay experience here so much to have it twice New Year's weekend.  I've always walked by it and wanted to try it out.  Both times we sat at the bar without wait and watched the games on the tv's that they had.  Made it convenient to get away from the sportsbook to grab a bite to eat and drink and not miss the game.  The first time we went, we ordered the chicken wings, deviled eggs and sliders.  The chicken wings were pretty tasty and a nice portion.  The deviled eggs were not cut as beautifully as I'm used to, but it didn't sacrifice its' taste, they were still delicious, topped with bacon.  The sliders were pretty good as well.  Not a huge fan of the bun type but the patty, cheese and bacon were a good combination.  The second time we came I had the corned beef brisket sandwich and the butter chicken with rice.  The corned beef brisket was moist and delicious.  I wish it came with fries automatically instead of the kettle chips, but the chips were good as well.  The butter chicken was also a great dish even from a place that doesn't focus on Indian cuisine.  The pita bread was good but I probably would have preferred the butter chicken to have a little more of a punch and spice.  Service was great both times, everyone was very nice and attentive.  Overall, a place with solid food and service.  Would definitely come back in the future.",

Mix match seating with living room chairs. Some of the seating sit low. We ordered the devil eggs for appetizer and fish and chips. The deviled eggs just was to much over the top for my liking. They had bacon and cheese in the filling. I do like the concept of putting the filling into your egg. The fish and chips, hubby like the chips as long as they were warm. I have mixed feeling about them. Love the ketchup!!!! The fish was really good along with the tartar sauce and mets vinegar. Oh the peas, ate all of those they were really good.   Service what service??? Yeah okay right maybe next time service will show up......",

After 35mins, asking another waitress to track down our waitress and complaining to the runner our food arrived cold, not all six entrees (burgers and chicken sandwiches) were brought out together...and the best part, 1 entree was missing!!!!! Oh, and we were still charged for the missing entree.....only after we complained was the item removed from our bill.  The most annoying part...they automatically charge 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.....smh, that explains why we weren't offered any type of apologetic gesture... Our waitress did apologize for the mishap when she brought us the check, but nonetheless....we couldn't wait to leave.   The best part of the evening.....the sweet, attentive older Latina woman who kept refilling our water glasses. Give that lady a raise!",

Ordered the 8 oz ribeye and 14 oz tenderloin both with the pub steak sauce and both steaks were dry. The steak sauce also wasn't good nor anything like A1 and they didnt offer A1 as an alternative! Steak was probably dryer than the desert. Also the only sode that came with the steaks were 3 pieces of asparagus. The dessert was about the size of my palm.   Price - RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. Both steaks, no matter the size was $40 EACH. Since there was a SEVERE lack of sides, we ordered a side of fries which ended up being $10 for a measly cup of basic fries. The tiny dessert would have been $11  Service - TOOK ALMOST ONE HOUR TO GET OUR FOOD! I was about to walk out of the restaurant. They claimed it was because they were busy and a lot of people ordered steak but there were many empty tables and no one I saw ordered steak.  The server offered free dessert as compensation for the wait but this place still gets a negative review. Seriously not worth the wait. Its a trap!",

My friend's steak was ordered medium rare but was delivered looking like a microwaved hamburger. Zero pink and no juices flowing from the steak. It took 10 minutes to track down the waitress who didn't seem surprised and said it looked more like a medium well vs medium rare. If she thinks dark grey is medium well, she probably should look into a different career path. It took 25 minutes to receive a replacement steak, which is ridiculous. They should have taken the next steak off the grill. The manager acted like he was doing us a favor by removing the steak from the bill, despite the fact that it was delivered after every other dish had been cleared from our table.   This was an embarrassing effort from a restaurant with a celebrity name and $100 per head prices for food and a couple drinks. Pass.",

Mind you it was a Saturday night during the memorial weekend. It only took a few minutes till our table was ready. Once seated, water was arrived at our table. Looked over the menu, selection was good. Some items looked amazing while others were just good. The drink menu was great.  Our waiter was excellent, very friendly and funny.  We didn't really get a starter besides soup. As at that point haven't not eaten all day we were ready for the main dish. Tried both the onion and and tomato bisque soup. Between those two, the onion was more of a favorite. Our main dishes arrived, portion wise was good. The steak pies was alright, and for the price. It was a bit high. Was a bit to dry for my liking with the pie crust and could use a bit more gravy. The lobster Mac and cheese was great. Really filling. Butter chicken curry was great. Portion was excellent. Kettle chips nachos may have been my favorite our off all the dishes we ordered. It's a starter but could be a main dish. The amount given is great for sharing or for a hungry soul. We also had the sticky toffee pudding which was a great ending to the meal. Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in caramel sauce. I've had it Europe plenty of times and this could compare to it.   Pros: Great drink menu. Friendly staff  Amazing location in cesar palace. Fun group gathering. Great English vibe.  Cons: Overpriced",

Replace them unless  the worn and dingy look is your goal. I get the Brit pub look, but we are paying Ramsay prices and expect better than average.  The service was horrendously slow. The Beef Wellington was flavorful, but our food temp was tepid, at best. We chose to not to have it redone, as we could not bear the wait. The Mac and Cheese side was very tasty and the awkwardly the best dish of the night.   We skipped the starter so we could save room for our favorite Ramsay dessert, the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I timed it at nearly 15mins to get to the table. The dish and sauce again arrived at room temp. We sent it back and had them take it off the bill.   A well-run establishment would have a management member address our concerns. None did.  What is sad is that the flavors are there, but service is lacking. If Gordon was here, he would be screaming about the food dying in the window.",

    "text": "interestingly enough, it was pretty f***ng good!  I'll preface this review by saying I have not watched Gordon Ramsay's show, but have come to know if his rep via social media and news outlets.  Our family had dined at this location two years ago post Celine Dion show, and we looked forward to returning on our most recent Vegas vacation.  NOTE:   Reservations made via Open Table.  Making a res proved to be good idea as the pub was quite busy when my mom and I arrived at five minutes to the hour.   SETTING: The restaurant is located on the casino level, LITERALLY across from the entrance to the Colosseum venue.  I'm sure one could not miss Chef Ramsay's name in bright lights (I'm sure he wouldn't have it any other way).  We checked in and briefly waited on the side for the hostess to show us to our seats.  The pub is simply decorated, and pays homage to its origins by way of a keg wall separating seating sections.    FOOD: Having studied the menu on the website, I knew I wanted to order the Shepard's Pie while my  mom chose the salmon.  We each ordered a cocktail as well; Goodbye Blue Sky for the lady, and the Mules Hind Leg (their version of the Moscow Mule) for myself.  I just loved the Shepard's Pie!  It was a perfectly sized portion and prepared well.  The top layer of potatoes is a bit deceiving of the dish, which is revealed brimming with filling as soon as you breach the surface.  A good dish indeed.  My mom absolutely loved her dinner entree.  She couldn't stop gushing about the salmon being prepared to her liking, as well as the numerous greens and vegetables on her plate.    SERVICE: Very outstanding.  Our server was an extremely nice, polite, and all around friendly guy.  He expertly answered our questions about the menu, and we appreciated his patience while we looked over the menu.  Needless to say, he truly made our evening a truly positive dining experience overall.  BOTTOM LINE: Great service.  Well prepared food.  Good energy.  Thanks Chef.....I'll be back for more Shepard's Pie.",

    "text": "Whenever you go to Vegas, you have to try some Gordon Ramsay restaurants. My family came here for lunch, and we had a reservation from Opentable, so there was no wait for us. Also, just a heads up, since this is a pub and really close to the casino floor, it can get a bit noisy inside. We skipped ordering appetizers, and headed straight to the entrees. The entrees are pretty pricey here, but that is to be expected with a brand name, such as Gordon Ramsay. For the entree, I went with the English Cheddar and bacon burger. I typically like my burgers medium well, and the burger was cooked to perfection. The patty was very flavorful and had an excellent amount of seasoning. Even the buns were very soft and fluffy. Unfortunately, I forgot to upgrade to the truffle fries, but the regular fries were seasoned well with salt and pepper. They were a perfect golden brown, and had just the right amount of crispiness. Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp because you get a free sticky toffee pudding! It is a great way to finish off your meal, and also comes with a big scoop of ice cream!",

I couldn't choose between but I made the decision here because the prices were reasonable for everyone.   I came for a specific meal - Beef Wellington. It was amazing. Everything I expected and more. I needed more sauce but the waitress was quick in coming back so I was very pleased. I also got truffle fries and the sticky toffee pudding. The dessert was amazing no complaints about anything here.   My boyfriend got a cheeseburger and it was very tender meat it was probably the most perfect burger I've ever tried! My other friends got the chicken and fish and chips. They said the chicken was very tender until the very end. Fish and chips were not greasy and tasted very crispy and good. The 35oz beers were fun and the guys enjoyed it.   The decor was lovely such a nice pub / steak house feel and it was pretty casual. I love all the photos of chef everywhere to be reminded of a great chef and great food.",

    "text": "Went here because of the affordability. The food was great, roasted tomato soup ( I did find a hard piece of tomato inside tho) the shrimp and lobster roll pub bites ( definitely two bites) and the fish and chips.   The portions for the bites were small as I would expect but for an entree I was really surprised that it was not much bigger. Truly a good bite but there are so many restaurants that give bigger portions for the same price and truly just as good. I get you always pay for the name and being in Las Vegas you pay double but a few more chips or a larger piece of fish should. It be breaking the bank and anyone know the mark ups are usually the alcohol anyway.   The place itself already is seeing wear, chipped paint for example. It was a bit surprising as anyone watching Chef's shows knows he looks at everything.   The staff, very attentive.... too attentive. This is where I took two stars away. Drink the water and they would fill it within seconds, great right? Not really as they would each across the table and pour from a height that I was just waiting for the splash.  I appreciate a quick refill but when in the middle of a conversation it's a bit annoying to have the person stand over you.  Then there was the clearing. Usually a server will wait, notice that the plate hasn't been touched for a few minutes and then ask if you are done. Not so, here the plates were asked to be cleared while eating, literally rushed to finish a bite because the server or the bus person , both were quick to clear, would stand close and wait for the second I was finished.   The restaurant was not busy so why such a rush... end of shift? If you go here sit at the bar, grab a small bite and a drink. It's interesting to see how Chef does his restaurants if you watch his shows. I like the design, the thought down to the uniform but that front of the house is important and as you watch you will see how it is not a Swiss time piece not matter how fancy it looks.",

I had the kettle chips and they were ok. By the time I finished eating them the chips were mostly soggy. I also tried the shrimp and lobster rolls and they were pretty good. The roll was buttery and crispy. They were pretty small though.   I also tried their Brussel sprouts and they were good. They were crispy and sweet from a balsamic glaze. The portion was good to share with someone else.  The best part of the meal though was the free toffee pudding that came from checking in on yelp. It's kinda sad to think that that is what actually made the whole meal worth it. This dessert is supper tasty! The ice cream cones in an edible chocolate cup.   Would I go back? Meh...maybe to get another dessert.",

He gave us great recommendations and even adjusted my order so it would be extra yummy  Lobster and Shrimp Roll - To be honest, the roll is TINY HAHA i guess it really is an appetizer. I thought it would be bigger but it's super good and creamy   Lamb Burger - BOMB!! Get this when you come here. I'm not a fan of goat cheese so I subbed the toppings, added bacon. So good dude and it comes with truffle fries to die for  Fish and Chips - I actually wasn't a fan of this one. The batter is pretty thick and oily. But the fish itself is really good quality!!   Tomato Soup - can't go wrong with tomato soup. It also comes with a garlic bread that is super flavorful!   I really enjoyed my meal here and would recommend anyone staying at Caesars Palace to give it a try. Unfortunately I didn't try any of the brews but I'll be back :)",

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in deciding what me and my best friend should order and they did not disappoint. My best friend ordered the braised short rib and I had the hellfire wings (as pictured below). The food was AMAZING and I rarely ever eat blue cheese at all but the blue cheese with the wings is truly better than the ranch. Also to be a Gordon Ramsay establishment the prices were fairly moderate. Usually when you go in to high celebrity named restaurants the prices are astronomical just due to the celebrity association but I love that Ramsay's restaurants here in Vegas seem to be priced very well especially for the quality of the food you are getting. A huge thank you to this establishment for the amazing food and the ability to show my best friend a good time with good food on her trip away from home. I definitely recommend the wings as an appetizer of even the shrimp and lobster rolls, either one will NOT disappoint.",

First night we came for drinks and a snack.  We had the Vic Queen Chips and Deviled Eggs.  Both were excellent.  The Chips were very delicate - thinly cut and perfectly fried - served with a side of malt vinegar for dipping.  Just excellent!!  The Deviled Eggs were served in an interesting way.  The egg whites were served separately, sprinkled with parsley, and the yolks were served in a small cup for you to scoop out and put as much as you wanted into the egg whites. The yolks were smashed and mixed with smokey bacon and cheese.   They were by far the best deviled eggs I have ever had.  In all, this experience was 5 star.  The second night we came shortly after 5 PM for the dinner menu.  We again sat at the bar.  They were out of the first beer that I ordered, but offered me a sample of another beer that I might like.  The bartender was very helpful.  We ordered the Fish & Chips.  It took about 25 minutes for us to get our food, which is a little long, but we thought it might be due to a lot of folks ordering right around 5 PM when they start the dinner menu.  I figured if anyone could do fish & chips right it would be Gordon Ramsay - however, I was disappointed in this meal.  It was definitely not the best fish & chips that I had ever had.  The fish was OK, the batter was really good, but the fish was a little dry & tough - like it had been overcooked.  I prefer fish that is more moist and flaky.  A thicker piece of fish would probably have held up better to the cooking.  The potatoes were the biggest disappointment, though.  We expected chips (french fries) what we got were big blocks of potatoes - hand cut in rectangles - which had been boiled and baked and fried into a state of blandness that I would never expect from a Gordon Ramsay product.  They were hard at the ends, like they had been overdone.  They were not seasoned at all - no salt when they were removed from the deep fryer - and no flavor at all.  However, the mushy peas were outstanding!!!  I have never really liked mushy peas - I mean, really, who would like anything called mushy peas?  However, this was a combination of whole baby peas and mushy peas with some seasoning that had me eating the entire portion (a first for me.)  In general the bartenders were very helpful and friendly.  Would have been nice had someone checked on our dinner and let us know the status when we went so long without getting our meal, but that's a small point.  I liked the decorations.  It's pretty noisy with music playing but not so much that we couldn't hear each other or talk to the people next to us.  It was pretty busy for 5 PM.  Probably even busier later on.  I would go again, but not for the Fish & Chips - definitely for the Deviled Eggs though.",

Managar suggested Innis & Gunn, reading other reviews, does seem they push that beer.  It was quite good.  Had the fish and chips based on Yelp feedback.  Good choice.

I guess the uniforms were supposed to be disco 80's, but I felt sorry for the girls. Our food service was prompt. I expect pub food to be fattening and it was delicious as well. I had the sliders and my husband had a ham and cheese sandwich.  I hope Ramsey keeps his eye on this place to keep it up to par. I've read several poor reviews that I think would get his ire up! Maybe better training of the staff? Our experience was great.",

We sat on the pub side and we were not even offered to look at the pub menu. It wasn't until we ordered that I realized there was a second menu. We both chose the fish and chips. Greasy thick batter on flavorless fish. Chips were these thick cut and I don't mean steak like fries, I mean these block rectangular potatoes with no seasoning.  If you want fish and chips go to his steakhouse at Paris!!!  Also, the place just opened and Vegas was packed but this place was half empty at 9 pm.  Lousy vibe and music. The only positive were the cocktails.  Much better choices in Vegas.",

    "text": "\"Gordon Ramsay would throw this plate across the room\", said one of my co-workers after tasting their entree.  I went here on a Wednesday night with two co-workers, while in town for business.  We all decided to order the fish and chips, but there was little consistency between the three plates.  Both of my co-workers received three pieces of fish, that were barely deep fried.  The batter was very soggy with no crisp or crunch you expect with an order of fish and chips. One of the dishes came out missing the lemon wedge and tartar sauce, which was quickly brought upon request.  While mine were cooked longer and actually tasted good, I only received two pieces instead of three.  The 'chips' tasted very much like Burger King's fries, something you don't expect when paying this price.  A friendly waiter could have made this experience better, but ours wasn't very personable.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, especially with so many other options in Las Vegas.",

The bread basket is actually 3 mini pretzels, which were delicious and it was a nice change. The potatoes were topped with parmesan and complemented the steak quite well. The steaks were cooked as we had asked and were absolutely delicious. The thing i was not pleased with were the sauces that they have. Everything has a bitter funky taste to it. I am not sure if they are adding mustard or horseradish or what the deal is but when i have ketchup i want it to taste like ketchup. The prices don't really match the ambiance and the decor offered here. This place is more of a bar/grill rather than a steakhouse but you will pay steakhouse prices.

We left disappointed with the bland food, high prices, and indifferent service.  Between us all, we tried a number of items. After being warned off the chicken salad sandwich by our waiter, we had a couple burgers, a couple tomato soups, a chicken pot pie, an chicken curry dish - by far the best, and a ny strip steak. Rather than go through item by item, suffice to say that the food lacked seasoning, was generally overcooked, and did little to distinguish itself beyond meeting the requirements of what we ordered.   Between the ten of us, with a couple sodas, one beer (nine bucks) and a couple glasses of wine, the total came to three hundred bucks. While this was not intended to be a \"highlight\" meal for our trip, it was still disappointing.   Finally, I don't know what horrible thing had happened to our waiter prior to his shift, but his attitude reeked of indifference to the happiness/satisfaction of his table. (Although he might have done me a favor warning me off the chicken salad, who knows.) Given other reviews I have read here, our service experience was not unique.",

We arrived at 8:30and were seated promptly but did not receive our meal until after 10:00pm.  Apparently an 8 oz, well done burger takes awhile to cook.  This is what the waitress told us and then we were told by a manager they had a \"small\" kitchen problem. Upon receiving our meal half the orders had been sitting under the heat lamp so long they felt like they had been prepared yesterday.  We received some replacement \"chips\" for our Fish N' Chips which were warm but completely uncooked in the center.  The staff offered little assistance and was completely absent.  Seemed like they knew a situation was occurring but neglected to inform our party of 8 or even try to come by our section.  I will never be back here to dine.",

We waited 30 minutes past our predicted seating time- I can understand this, as jostesses have no control over when people get up. But after waiting  a half hour over our wait time, we got no apology from management. Our waiter ignored us for the most part; the most active he was was when he failed to ask our beer sizes and automatically charged us for big beers. Our drinks, apps and food came out at one time- again with no apology from server or manager. I work in the service industry and can be extremely forgiving, but overall the food and service were far below par.",

The plate looked like it came out of a magazine, the beef was a perfect medium rare and the potatoes were so creamy.  The vegetable were cooked too perfection. The crust surrounding the beef was flaky and not too dry. The lobster mac and cheese came out perfect also, the lobster was not over cooked and the portion of lobster in the dish was perfect. They say you get what you pay for, well with this meal we absolutely got what we paid for. A excellent meal with a perfect price. The waiter Adam was very friendly and did not hover over us, he gave us plenty of time too figure out what we wanted. He answered all our questions and definitely knew what he was talking about. He took the time to make us feel at home and enjoy a wonderful meal. Yes I would recommend that if you are in Vegas stop and see Adam, and hope you feel welcomed as much as he made us feel.",

Not overloaded with mayo but just enough where the rolls weren't dry. Good amount of shrimp and lobster. The bread was so warm and soft. It was a tease, my husband and I wanted more but you only get two. For our entrees, I ordered the braised beef pot pie. The meat was so tender and the pie was creamy with veggies and mushroom flavor galore! I love mushrooms! My husband ordered the lamb Shepard pie. It had mashed potatoes on top. The pie itself was creamy and filled with ground lamb and veggies. My husband devoured it and enjoyed it. I normally don't like lamb but I had a little bite and it tasted great! Don't let the size fool you. Small but you will get full and possibly a food coma.  For dessert we had the toffee pudding ( if you check in on yelp, it's free) it was the most delicious dessert I have ever had! My husband and I were very impressed with this restaurant and had a great experience! We will have to try Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants when we return to Las Vegas :)",

I even reserved a table about two weeks prior to going to Vegas to ensure we had seating since it always looks so busy. I show up about 5 minutes before and they tell us to stand by on the side and wait to be seated. OK we waited a little over 30 minutes to be seated. I understand it's busy but why have reservations if they don't even reserve the table for us.  As we sat down, I thought the decor was nice and the outfits the waiters had on looked pretty awesome. Our waiter's name was Michael. We looked over the menu and asked for recommendations on our main dishes. For starters, we had the French onion soup and I wasn't a bit impressed with it. I took Michael's recommendation and ordered the Braised Shortrib. I didn't like it either, I thought that it would be better. Even the beef burger that we had wasn't as good as the one at Planet Hollywood BURGR Restaurant. Out if all the Gordon Ramsay restaurants his one was the biggest disappointment and I wont be back.",

Not sure how this place stays busy enough to stay open because most of the people I talked to during the convention I was there for were not impressed either. They all suggested going to Bobby Flays MESA instead but didn't get a chance to.",

The service was generally very good, though it took a little while to get the check.  I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, which was amazing!  The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the zucchini bread balanced the pesto and roasted red peppers beautifully.  The kettle chips were only okay, and were a little hard for my taste.  I also ordered a side of swiss chard, which was wonderfully rich!  The Goodbye Blue Sky drink was excellent as well.  My husband got the classic fish and chips and absolutely loved the cook and flavor!  We never knew the \"mushy peas\" could be so good :)  I would highly recommend!",

After all, it's nearly 2x what I've ever paid even though it was super beautiful white fish; 2 smallish pieces with a generous amount of fries, and a very little ramekin filled with fresh peas (and a bit of mint).  The flavor of everything was great even though I didn't have one bite with both fish & coating -- it broke when cutting it.  (3.0 stars due to price)  $18 for Sandwich?   It was terrific, though.  Chicken pesto with roasted peppers, arugula, tomato, caramelized onions.  Cold chicken, but the toasted bread was so good, it made up for it.  British?  (4.5 stars)  $11 dessert?  Sticky Toffee Pudding (available at all Ramsay eateries) is to die for.  Served with sweet cream ice cream and warm caramel poured over before your very eyes.  Mmmmm.  (4.5 stars)  Service was slow to begin with, but when Daisy finally made it over, she was all over my dining partner and I.  Very responsive, fun, and efficient.  (4.5 stars)  It's a really excellent pub, with drafts (Boddington's, $11) but expensive/costly/pricey.  Beautifully constructed, painted (like a pool table), and many different rooms offering a little different feel depending on your desire.  But, it's really expensive.  For that, I came and conquered but may not return.",

They have added a bunch of tables and used old conference room chairs that looked like they were pulled out of a storage room. We waited for ever for service and food. I would not recommend this place. There are way too many good places to eat in Vegas to have such a bad reastraunt. Maybe Gordon has spread himself to thin and cannot control the quality.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch with my boyfriend, since we had other obligations during our stay we couldn't visit a restaurant for dinner so we decided on a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. My boyfriend he is a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen so I picked this place since it was open for lunch. The decor was really fun and it had a British punk vibe. Our server was incredible sweet and nice.  Main lobster roll appetizer - two mini Lobster rolls, kinda felt like what sliders are to hamburgers. Very delicious and buttery.  Fish and chips with mashed peas - my boyfriend loves fish and chips so he ordered this classic. He isn't a huge fan of tartar sauce but really liked the kind served here, it was so fluffy like butter! The mashed peas were a surprise hit for him, since stateside they do not serve mashed peas. they really paired well with the giant pieces of fish.  Rib eye steak - it was good, but a little oversalted for me. I thought about sending it back but it was still decent and I was lazy and didn't want to bother. I was also hungry. The bearnaise sauce was good but too rich to go along. I wish I got a different sauce. It was served simply with asparagus. Not sure if I would pay $45 for it. Eh, I probably should have sent it back.  Sticky toffee pudding - my first time trying this! It was sickly sweet but delicious. The caramel topping had a deep flavor that added to the decadence of the cake. It reminds me of a very moist cake. You can taste the dates in it, but it's well blended, no chunks of dates it's just a well soaked cake. If you have a sweet tooth I wouldn't skip it. Sugar load in the best way!  All in all we had a good experience, I would round to 3.5 stars but rounded down due to my indifference about the steak. Should have been perfectly seasoned for $45,",

After glancing at the menu by the front, we decided this was a better option.  It wasn't very busy and we were greeted promptly at the host stand but we opted to sit at the bar.  Our bartender, Matt, was outstanding. He might be the best bartender I've ever had in my entire life!!  He was knowledgeable about the drinks, the menu, and made the best bloody Mary. He was also very friendly and offered a lot of great advice on what to do in the area that would be off the beaten path for the average tourist.    I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich which came with a side of chips.  It was nothing outstanding.  The sandwich actually kept falling apart and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife.  It was....edible. Being as Gordon Ramsey has his name on this restaurant, I expected a lot more from the food here.  With all the restaurant options in this area, I doubt I will be returning during my next trip to Vegas.  It's not a bad place but, not worth returning to.",

Given the manager doesn't even find an immediate problem with undercooked chicken, I'd rather not eat anything here. I declined the offer to remake and simply asked for our check. Of course I was charged for said undercooked wings. Overall a shitty experience with horrible management.",

The server suggested the deviled eggs, so I decided to try some. I've had amazing eggs at other places where they really jazz it up. These were literally just eggs you could make at home with bacon bits sprinkled on top.   We just ate a few hours earlier so I wasn't really feeling a full meal. Thank god because my friend got the short ribs which were bland and lacked any type of appeal. My other friend got the fish and chips which was a big portion and tasted way better in comparison to our dishes. I got the Caesar salad. Let me start by saying I LOVE dressing and am often told I use too much, but there was so much it was so unbearable I had to ask for extra croutons just to finish half of it. The salad was drenched in dressing and wasn't even edible.   We've been to other Gordon Ramsay places and I had my apprehensions reading all the reviews, but with all the other great places to eat on the strip...DO NOT eat here. Save your stomach space and money for something better.",

    "text": "I have to be honest this review is painful to write. I've been to many Gordon Ramsay restaurants and watch nearly all of his shows. I've enjoyed all of the restaurants I've been to that are run by Gordon Ramsay. I actually even enjoy this restaurant. I've been to this location three times now and the first two times deserve 5 to even 6 stars if I could. The most recent trip two weeks ago sadly did not live up to my expectations at all. I believe nearly all 7 members of my party did not really enjoy their meal. The appetizer I ordered was fine. The English sausage pigs in a blanket were fine. Then the entrees came and two members of my party including my wife ordered the lamb burger and somehow both came out different. One was a little soggy because of the goat cheese and onions combining and the other was very dry. I ordered the cornbeef brisket sandwich and it was disappointing as well. It had way too much sauerkraut but the cornbeef was very good. The chips that came with the sandwich were absolutely disappointing. I've never had a strange combination of chips. It seemed like a quarter of the chips were fine and the other three quarters were greasy and strange. The chips didn't have crunch and they were more like incredibly wet and soggy with grease. You could tell which chips were bad because they wouldn't snap when you bend them...they actually wouldn't break because they were so soggy. I have to admit I was very disappointed for multiple reasons. The food didn't live up to my previous experiences, we ate there also for a special occasion because it was my cousins birthday, and finally it was based on my suggestion that we eat there. I remember eating a delicious beef cheek sandwich there before and I understand the menu changes based on the season but I can't really suggest going back especially during the winter season again.",

The chicken felt like it was a week old and tasted like dried cardboard - seriously, I couldn't even eat a quarter of it because it was so hard.  The croutons added nothing but the texture of crunch. They had zero flavor.  The lettuce was wilted. The cheese was just giant shaved pieces of Parmesan that, somehow, tasted flavorless.   Overall, very disappointed. Obviously Ramsay doesn't do the cooking, but I would expect something with his name on it to adhere to his high standards. I hope you fly into Vegas and whip this place back into shape, Gordon. I do like the concept and decor otherwise.",

But due to my indulgence in adult beverages prior to coming here,  I wasn't that hungry...what a shocker,  I know.  I opted for the Sliders and a side of fries. The food came out faster than I thought. It presented very well atop a wooden plank. The sliders were cooked as ordered,  but the fries were a tad cold and soft. I didn't want to send the fries back cuz you know what happens when you do that... Our waiter was awesome and very attentive. My glass was always full.

The Lobster Rolls were delicious BUT the bread was too hard and there was too much bread in proportion to the lobster salad so that was a disappointment.  With all the food in Vegas I don't think we'd come back here.",

We reminded the waiter about our drink order. The bartender was EXTREMELY rude to us laughing at us under his breathe. I have never experienced something quite like this. With such rude service, we cancelled our drink order. The bartender out did himself by being even more rude to my family! Very disrespectful.   When we asked to speak with the manager it took him over 5-10 minutes to come speak with us. He had an inadequate response.   We ordered simple appetizers, truffle fries and nachos. The fries were not acceptable in any way to serve. There was an excessive amount of oil on the fries (a puddle) even the manager didn't think it was edible.   This is the worst restaurant in ceasers palace. They dont even deserve the one star that I am giving them. The only thing I can do at this point is to steer others away from this restaurant!!  Horrible experience. DO NOT COME HERE. I WILL NOT BE BACK.",

I wanted something light, as we were planning on gelato at the forum shops. I decided on the wedge salad- I can honestly say, with out taking a piss, it was clearly the best salad I have every eaten. I's scouring the internet as we speak looking for his vinaigrette recipe. My husband had the banger's and mash, and since he is straight out of London, he knows what is a hit and what is a miss. Definite hit. We added a couple pints and I have to say, it was a terrific meal. We had no wait on the food and I think if we had, so what~ Perfect place to people watch. Very Chill !

I had butternut soup that was tasty but baby food fine - I do prefer a bit of texture. We decided that we had 2 strikes and went to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for a great steak.",

Do not expect better quality than you would from the food court or handful of other Caesar owned food spots within Caesars Palace. Gordon Ramsay's influence ended at accepting a check to put his name above the door.   My friend and I didn't believe the restaurant  could be as bad as the reviews claimed. It was worse.  The fish and chips were revolting. I said to my friend, at least the bad reviews usually say the mushy peas are good. FALSE. I managed 2-3 bites of each, as did my friend, before sending it back. The waitress acted like she was doing me a favor by comping it, which was also contingent upon her taking the plates right then. Pretty insulting.  The staff was incompetent and rude. They wandered around clueless of what they should be doing. They would form large packs then break apart and begin wandering again, only to reform the pack in another area.  The sound from the sub woofer which was conveniently located 5 FEET behind my friends chair was an added bonus. We asked that it be turned down. The manager had the waitress tell us \"No\". For the record my friend and I are guys, we were there to eat, drink and watch the games. When I say the sound was to loud, I'm saying we had to lean in and almost yell to converse.   To add insult to injury my St. Bernadus 12 was served with a plastic cup.  This was par for my overall experience with Caesars. Pathetic.",

I love pub fare and after being a late fan to his show on tv, it seemed like a natural place to check out. My husband and I arrived on a Friday evening around 7 with no reservations. Hostess said around 30 min but if we found seats at bar to help ourselves and let her know. We did! That's where we are happiest anyway. Keith and Jose and a whole host of others took EXTREMELY good care of us. We ordered several different items from the menu including the scotch egg, fried oysters, and then the pork and duck rillettes. Omg. Everything was incredibly fresh, tasty and delicious in our book. The bartenders knew about different beers I asked about and advised accordingly. (I'm an IPA kind of girl).   They even changed the closest tv to something we requested with no issues.   I've read countless reviews about the service here and food and while I can't account for table service, our bar service was spot on. I would happily come back and keep trying more items on the menu. I know everyone has different experiences but ours was awesome. I hope that if you are reading this review that you take the adventure and go. It was great for us...at the bar...on a Friday night. Thanks to all at GR's P&G!",

We were pleasantly surprised by the great food here.  As soon as I saw poutine on the menu, I knew I need look no further.  Theirs is served with duck confit, brown gravy, just a little cheese, all on top of thin-cut fries.  It was rich and salty but also fabulous.  I would have licked the bowl if no one else was around.  My husband and daughter ordered different versions of their burger, and both loved them.  We also got a side of Brussels Sprouts.  These were very smoky and a bit overcooked, but otherwise okay.  They have this funny gimmick where your server hands you an iPad so you can view the drink menu.  There are buttons you can tap to place a drink order, only they don't actually work.  Turns out, the order isn't really placed via the iPad; you still have to order your drinks from your server.  Seems like a waste of time and technology to me.  I feel bad for the staff here.  The uniforms are pretty awful.  The men wear outfits that are sort of 1850s-bartender-meets-punk-rocker.  The hostesses wear tight tank dresses in a tacky newsprint pattern.  Still, it's more about the food than anything else, and the food here was very good.  I'd come back for that poutine again for sure.",

    "text": "So going into a restaurant with Gordon Ramswey's name on it, I wonder what he would do if this was a place on his famed Kitchen Nightmares.   First off, let me say the food was good. the only problem I had with the food is that it's very overpriced. I should've gotten a much better meal for what I was shelling out. And the decor and service left something to be desired. I asked for my drink to be served with my meal, and my meal arrived ten minutes before my drink, and I couldn't catch anyone to help me out, to the point where I didn't bother asking for salt, because I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to grab someone to bring me something that should've been on my table in the first place.  Which brings me to the table: I was seated in an oversized barstool, a ridiculous piece of furniture for even a pub/restaurant, making me wonder if Ramsey really did have anything whatsoever to do with setting up this restaurant.  If you're in Caesar's, don't bother with this place. Go to the Cheescake Factory instead. Better service and much more reasonably priced. And there's already salt on the table!  Ramsey, put this restaurant on your list for you own show!",

My fiance had the lamb chops  last year and  this time he enjoyed a juicy steak that was cooked just right.  Both of us also had the awesome lobster mac 'n' cheese and of course the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.   The food was super delicious, but what really keeps us going back is the service.  Manager Randy G. totally rocks when it comes to hospitality.  We had the pleasure of meeting him during our first visit and he actually remembered us when we returned a year later.

Antwone was hands down our favorite. Ladies, I am telling you, if you want a great view for the night, go no further. Antwone is the best view in Vegas. We ordered the chicken chop salad and scotch egg to split and I thought the food was amazing.  The people at the bar were social and fun. The whole vibe was great.

Their tone, demeanor, and body language reflected on how much they really didn't liked working there.  There seemed to be no management or supervision at all.  I really don't want disgruntled employees handling my food.  Lots of good people looking for jobs out there...  Food:  I ordered the fish and chips (20+$$$)  2 bites is all it took to realize that this tasted like long john silvers's fast food garbage.  It had no seasoning but it didn't lack the oil it was swamped in...very foul!!  The \"chips\" were thick rectangular potato wedges that tasted fine but nothing special.  Our waitress didn't seem to care and was not surprised at all, Hmmmm...makes ya wonder.  She seemed to care more about taking the plates away immediately as though my friend and I came there to scam them out of lunch. My friend ordered a rare and expensive beer that was supposed to be served in a special glass, but that didn't happen.  I wonder if they serve wine in shot glasses...after this experience it would not phase me one bit.  This place is a tourist trap using Gordon Ramsay's name and prices but clearly not his standards/quality.  The staff's \"costumes\" are hideous (maybe that's why they seem so disgruntled).  The noise level of this place is equal to a club, hope ya like to lean in and shout to one another!",

    "text": "Let's start with the good, since it won't take me long to cover that part.   The decor is definitely attractive and will peak your curiosity. Looks like a trendy new spot to stop by and hang out by the bar, or give a go at authentic British cuisine.   And we're done with the good. Now let's go into why I felt like I wasted a perfect meal-time (i hate it when that happens...) at Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant.  I literally ate like a rabbit all day just to save my stomach for Gordon Ramsay's. I mean, it's GORDON RAMSAY. The chef who is so angry and critical all the time, that I feel like his restaurant HAS to be good. I was so hungry that any mediocre dish (even fast food) could probably satisfy me, but Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill wasn't even close. For someone who markets himself as being a perfectionist in the kitchen, it certainly does not seem he has met his own standards.   I started with the Fried Oysters appetizer. The dish was presented with three oyster shells with two tiny fried bits in each. I literally felt like I was just eating batter. Wasn't much flavoring to it and wasn't anything special.   I followed it with the fish and chips. It wasn't terrible, but I feel like I could've probably found the same level of satisfaction at Long John Silver's. I would honestly rather make a stop at Long John's than pay $26 for that plate again. My date ordered the Braised Pork Belly ($30) and looked like it would be promising, but again, it was rather bland. You can definitely find a much better prepared pork belly elsewhere.   The most exciting part was probably the pretzels as the form of complimentary bread. It was offered with butter and a type of cheese-mustard. I've heard good things about the pudding dessert and that's probably the only thing that would ever weigh my consideration on returning.  My bill ended up being $100, 1 appetizer, 2 main course dishes, and 1 glass of Hennesey. Sadly, I would've been much happier spending that $100 at the Bacchanal Buffet.",

We started with delicious drinks--the Ramsay Tonic was the best gin and tonic I've ever had. How can a gin and tonic be better than another?! Next we had the calamari starter. Perfectly fried and seasoned, and the calamari were fresh and delicious. Coming from Boston, our seafood standards are high.  I had the fish and chips which were fantastic, My fiance had a ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly, and my niece had a steak and vegetable pie. The steak was reportedly not as good as home, but delicious. The steak and vegetable pie was reported to be tasty and flavorful. But oh my gosh, the sticky toffee pudding was a foodgasm!!!    I don't know how others could have had a bad experience here in the same time frame I visited. We ended up going back the next day for cocktails and more calamari, and would have dined there, but couldn't afford it.   The bartender confirmed that Chef Ramsay visits often and inspects to ensure the restaurant is up to his standards. It was fantastic!",

What I DO know is that I couldn't be happier with the meal i just had!  There are really clever design elements everywhere you look, from the hand-painted Keg wall to the 70s British punk uniforms for the staff, the distressed effect menus on wood boards, and the hand-hammered silverware that makes you want to buy a castle and tall-back velvet dining chairs just to put that silverware in it. So from an aesthetic standpoint, it does not disappoint at ALL.  The first thing that jumped out at me were the handmade soft pretzels appetizer. I just had to have that. SO good. They're amazing and come on a tray with a spicy, horse-radishy melted cheese and pub mustard. We also shared an order of the craziest (and most delicious) deviled eggs I've ever had. Four egg white halves seasoned with a warm, sparkly vinaigrette, and a bowl of the yolk seasoned with mustard, bacon and herbs.   I ordered Shepherd's pie, because it's one of Gordon's signature dishes, and because I have YET to have a decent Shepherd's pie in this country, though I keep trying. This was the best I've had anywhere. The stew was so rich and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes were perfect, with just the right amount of brown on the peaks. I really wanted Sticky Toffee pudding, but I am STILL way too full. Next time. There will most DEFINITELY be a next time.",

I thought we would have to wait a while for our food because the restaurant was packed, but the food came out right away! Big+ because I was tired and hungry. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was spicy and awesome. I ordered it well done bc I'm pregnant and I can't have it medium-well like I normally order burgers and steaks (my dr said no pink!). I was a bit worried because every time I have attempted to order something well done it comes back charred, which I absolutely hate. However, this burger was cooked to perfection! It is a bit on the expensive side (we paid $60+ for two burgers and two beverages). I expected it because of Gordon Ramsay's name being attached. It did not disappoint!

A local recommended this place as they had the best fish in chips in town, so my husband being a big fan of fish and chips, we thought hey why not?   Well, once we got seated, I looked around that people had pretzal breads at their tables, and I thought, looks good and cant wait to try.   Once we ordered our drinks, and food, there was no mention of bread coming or anything. So I looked at the menu, and did not see it on the menu to order it. We thought, it must come later.  So after about 15 min, we got our drinks, and no bread. Another 15 min, no bread. by this time, we are like WTF? Our waitress did not even come by!! UGH. I am hungry and mad  So 10 more min, she came by and we asked about the bread, and she said, \" you have to order it\". well by this time, our dinner was coming, and we said no.  Our food finally came. I ordered the Salmon, and I had asked if it was salty, and she said no. well first bite: SALTY!! UGH! Oh and it said it came with garlic chips, so I was expecting FRIES! as the rest of the menu had CHIPS (which are fries). Well you know what they were? SMALL ASS 4 pieces of garlic american chips. So small I didnt even see them!!!   the fish and chips were OKAY, notthing special. I have had much better in Seattle and in dana Point, CA.   So overall:  1. SERVICE: SUCKS! ( water NEVER got refilled) 2. FOOD is WAY TO Overprices for what you get (I can get much better food for the same price in Vegas) 3. FOOD IS OKAY, nothing WOW.  I will never come back here again, and I do not recommend it at all. horrible horrible. Dont waste you time. Vegas is about fun and good food, well this is not one of them.

We had a party of 10, and called at 8pm on a Thursday night, they couldn't fit us in until 9.45pm. OK so they're busy - a good sign I thought. We arrived at the appointed time, and there were about 20 people lined up for tables. Our table was ready so we went straight in.  Service was terrible! We struggled to get the attention of a waiter to order drinks, and food. Drinks were slow to come to the table (maybe within 30 mins of sitting down), and the food took over an hour and 15mins to arrive! They got some of the orders wrong too. The place was not full, almost empty by the time we got our food.  Within 5 minutes of our food arriving (by then 11.10pm) they turned the lights down, and down, all the way to almost complete darkness. We were eating in the dark! The waiters were using their iPhones flashlight just to see where they were going. We asked a passing waiter to turn the lights back on, he said he would have to ask his manager - eventually they turned them up a bit.  The food was hit and miss. Fish and Chips - great fish, light fluffy batter, but disappointing chips - giant slabs of potato that were not crunchy or flavorful. It came with \"house made tomato sauce\" which tasted *exactly* like Heinz Ketchup.  My friends weren't raving about their food either, some was good, some average.  If Gordon was there he would've slammed this place shut until they got their act together.",

At 6:18 I had to ask one of the 5 waiters/waitresses that had walked by without even looking at us, I had to ask if one of them could help us, and/or who was the server at our table.  We found out that 'Jennifer' was over our table and never did show up and at 6:25pm when 'Kimberly' was assigned to us she comes over apologizes to us, turns to the table beside us to take their order who was just seated, the couple points out that we had been waiting forever and the waitress Kimberly says to her 'it\"s ok, I will get them in a minute!'  My wife bless her heart is not one to make a scene stands up with me and I tell the waitress we are leaving for good. Out the door we went, we will not be back, period.  I am a Hugh Gordon Ramsay fan, books, cookware, knives, we have been to dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas, which was excellent. Just for the Gordonites in the crowd.  We left went over to Bobby Flays 'Mesa Grill', was seated in less than 2 minutes, waitress acknowledgement and glass of water on the table in less than 1 minute! Hugh difference, not even close!  Amazing Food and Amazing Service from Mesa Grill!! Saved our evening.  I realize that no may care of even read this review but, it was extremely upsetting to see such a bad performance by the staff of a World Class Chef who I highly admire.

    "text": "This is one of those place that you had to try at least once in your lifetime...  Riding on the coat tails of Ramsay's popularity, I came here for dinner one night with my mother.  After a day of high-rolling gambling (nickel slots), I was interested in trying this place out.  We were not in the mood for burgers (that's why we passed on Ramsay's Burgr) and didn't feel like taking out a loan to dine at Ramsay's Steak at the Paris casino.  So being the penny-pincher that I am, I opted for Pub & Grille since a) it was somewhat affordable, b) it was close-by (walking distance from where we were staying), and c) had food items on the menu that we were interested in trying.  Since it was on a weekday, the hostess said that reservations were not necessary but it would be a good idea.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 p.m. and continued with my high-rolling ways until then.  We got there a few minutes before 7:00 p.m. and was a bit surprised that the place was nearly empty.  There were a few patrons sitting in the front for drinks but not many for food.  The dining area was pretty nice; it was fairly dim but not too dark that we couldn't read the menu.  The entire restaurant was spotless and well decorated.  There was this huge poster of Ramsay on the wall just staring at the patrons, which was intimidating yet sort of funny.  Since my mother and I are relatively small eaters, we shared the fish n' chips and a side of braised vegetables.  The fish n' chips were nearly $30 so it better be good!  And it was!  I was probably one of the best fish n' chips I ever had.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flaky and the batter was not heavy/oily at all.  The fish was not overwhelmed by the batter.  The braised vegetables was perfectly cooked; it wasn't mushy and the flavor of each individual vegetable was preserved.  There was a light covering of butter but not too much; it complemented the dish perfectly.  Our server was very nice and attentive; checked on us every so often to make sure our meal was pleasant.  Overall my experience at Pub & Grille was positive.  Both my mother and I agreed that the quality of food was outstanding (agreement between us is very rare!).    Great place to eat if you're tired of buffets!",

The server went over and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything and recommeneded a few dishes for us to try. We had just landed in Vegas after a long flight and we were pleasantly surprised at how quick the service was. The food I would consider to be pub food, but it was great and just what we needed being so jet lagged.   Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Food-Nothing amazing but the truffle fries were yummy! Sometimes restaurants serve it with too much truffle and what not and makes me sick lol. I would definitely go back and try another dish... I don't remember what I got but it was ok.  Decor-loved! We had a huge booth too and a lot of room.   Service- Amazing! Everyone here had recommendations (even though I didn't try any of it haha) and always made sure we had everything we needed.  Very friendly and fun staff working here.   I would for sure go back and actually try something they recommend... I'll definitely give the food another chance!",

    "text": "Second time here overall, and first time here for dinner.   I was less than impressed. I ordered the Spots (sliders) and the meat was not seasoned at all. It tasted like plain hamburger meat and the oily grease dripped down my hand as I took a bite. Furthermore, there was no sauce on the spot and cheese was no where to be found which made it very dry. :(  The truffle chips were good. It was served with ketchup and a truffle aioli sauce. Now the aioli, I could spread on almost anything and enjoy it. At the same time, condiments shouldn't taste better than the food itself.  Finally, we tried the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. A small container of caramel came on the side so we poured that over the bread-like substance. This dessert has to have been the best part of my dining experience here. Although it could do without the brittle that was placed in the ice cream. The brittle was not sweet and just tasted like nuts. I felt it didn't really belong in this dessert.  The rest of it though was so delicious!!!   This Pub & Grill is an over priced Celebrity restaurant. I don't feel the quality is up to par with other restaurants in Las Vegas that are cheaper. Sorry, not sorry Ramsay.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of GR food shows and feel, if Pub & Grill were on Kitchen Nightmares, there would be some needed changes.   Perhaps he is just collecting the check and isn't as close to how the restaurant is being run?  While it wasn't a nightmare dining experience, it was disappointing because I know the hell GR puts other restaurants through.  Misses:  French soup was not a soup but an onion stew.  Way overdone on the onions and the bread was burnt on the edges.  Shepherd's Pie had greasy gravy instead of a well-developed flavorful, thick gravy.    The service was fast on delivering the food and drinks but slow on clearing plates, not getting the right entree in front of the right person (that has to be an expected from GR!?) and checking back in, not bringing malt vinegar automatically for fish & chips nor a lime for a vodka and tonic.  Hits:  Atmosphere was fun, if a little loud.  Mini Burger Sliders were small but tasty.  Mashed potatoes on top of the shepherd's pie - so smooth and well executed.  Fish for the fish and chips.  Pretty close to the real thing!  Fairly varied drink/beer list.  Expect the typical LV jacked up prices.  It would have almost been worth it if all had been executed in True GR fashion.",

I got the mixed green salad with elegant vegetables and heirloom tomatoes and it was great, very delicious! The white balsamic vinaigrette dressing on it was so good!! We also both got the steak and ale pie (beer braised beef with root vegetables and an amazing flaky perfectly crisp pie crust), and it was FANTASTIC! I can't wait to go back! Finally, at the end of our meal, I like how the manager asked if we enjoyed our food and made everyone feel well-attended. I expect a lot from a restaurant owned by Gordon Ramsay, and this lived up to the hype! Delicious & cool.",

The pretzels and dips were to die for and the salad was perfectly balanced in flavor and felt like a relatively healthy option compared to some of the other things on the menu. My friend really enjoyed her pesto chicken sandwich and fries as well.  The portions were huge so I felt like you weren't ripped off by any stretch considering it was a meal on the strip. Our server was AWESOME too, I wish I had gotten his name. Super friendly and on point, even gave me a refill of my soda in a to go cup which I thought was such a nice touch.  I only knocked one star off because the entrees took SO long to come out considering the place was less than half full....if they figured that out I think the restaurant would definitely deserve a 5* review.",

The service was ok, I mean there wasn't a lot of people so it should be expected.   As for the food, I had the lamb burger as the server mentioned it was one of their top sellers. I had it cooked medium rare but should have chosen medium. The patty had a mushy texture that did not appeal to me. The combination of the feta and goat cheese was probably my least favorite of that burger. I only ate a quarter of my burger and couldn't even muster my appetite to eat it all. The only thing positive here is the truffle fries and the sauces that come with it.",

    "text": "Went here last week a few weeks after it officially opened. Saw them doing practice dinners earlier in the week.  Overall, the place wasn't bad, but it wasn't wowing. I actually came here twice. Once for a business dinner, which was good food and great service. We had reservations and were promptly seated. The waiters had interesting uniforms, especially the very well supporting women's dresses. We ended up having 5 instead of 4 halfway through our meal and were very pleased with the flexibility of the staff considering the stature of the restaurant and their relatively business and newness. Props to them for being extremely considerate.  The food was good, for being British. Admittedly, my opinion of British food has never been good or bad. Just mediocre. Gordon Ramsay's name on it makes me have naturally higher expectations. As expected, the menu is relatively small, but very selective.  Since I had higher expectations, I can tell you that the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was amazing. I enjoyed eating here and so did all of the other people that came with me. We had a full course of appetizers, followed by entrees, and desserts.  So, I managed to get a full compliment of what the restaurant had to offer. After this visit, I went back with a few buddies after gambling at Caesar's and we just wanted to get drinks at the bar but they were 'too busy' to seat us so we actually stood at the bar waiting for somewhere to sit. We even had a waitress try to get one of the hostesses to seat us in one of the obviously empty tables, but they refused saying that they were booked. Needless to say, this part of my experience was a bit offsetting. In addition to that, we bartenders were a bit hissy when it came to asking to close the tab, which we found a bit odd. They seemed less than concerned to help us pay them.  Overall, I would say my experience was pretty good and that I would come back, just not for the bar. Only for food/drinks if I have a reservation. Oh, and I loved the Corgi chair that I had been sitting in. I'll post a picture later.",

We were greeted by Randi  who seated my husband and myself  at  what was  an intimate booth which surprised us, as the restaurant was extremely  packed. As soon as we sat down I noticed Randi replacing our utensils with another set of clean utensils. He caught me looking at him when he did this and responded to me by saying \"Sorry, those weren't shiny enough  ...Talk about someone being on top of their game.  Randi then introduced us to our waiter/server, Taylor. We chitchatted for a few seconds on how our day was and then proceeded to ask him his recommendations. We started with the lobster rolls. I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE lobster, but I have reservations in regards to ordering it in cities that are far from the ocean, however the meat on these rolls were absolutely delicious. One order between my husband and I definitely was not enough.  For our main course I got the Fish and Chips and while my husband ordered the BANGERS & MASH for himself. My meal was extremely tasty. The fish was extremely tender and did not have that oily after taste many other Fish and Chips meals come with. My assume husband enjoyed his meal as well as he did not even offer me a bite of his dinner.  We definitely stuffed our faces during dinner and as embarrassing as this sounds, we did also end up ordering dessert, which was definitely unnecessary but extremely worth it. Their pudding cake is to die for. It is a must when visiting this restaurant. All in all I can honestly say I had a really great experience dining here. The service was way above average. Randi and Taylor are absolute gems and made our experience wonderful.  Taylor made sure our glasses were never empty, our food was hot when it arrived  and continuously asked us if we needed anything else throughout our dining experience.  We are planning another trip with our entire family in the next few weeks to Vegas and we cannot wait to bring everyone back here to experience the awesome food.  5 STARS !!!!!!!",

Our waiter (Mike or Michael, IIRC) was excellent.  The food overall was a solid 4.  The drinks were great as well but incredibly expensive; the bottled beer the waiter recommended to my husband was $25!  He said it was good but not THAT good.  I had asked for a cocktail that was sweet but didn't taste too strong; and that's what he got for me (it was $17).  It hit me pretty hard even though it didn't taste strong.  I can't actually remember what my entree was (edited to add:  I think it was scallops?), though I remember dessert was some sort of parfait, and I remember that my husband and I both agreed on the 4 star rating overall.",

Thankfully, our table was ready.  I love the modern old pub feel with images of London all around. Gosh, we ordered enough to share and seriously, everything was so good! I had he'd the pork chops with a chunky apple sauce- chops were cooked perfectly. Fish and chips we're not oily and had just the right crunch-the fries are just the way I like them crunchy in the outside and soft on the inside. Braised pork belly- oh yeah a winner. I can't even deep scribe the taste really just that I was so happy eating it. We also had the home made pretzels with the mustard dipping sauce. Great with beer! We shared the toffee pudding and I had to stop myself from finishing it had to share win other, plus I was so stuffed that I didn't want to roll out of there!  The service was excellent and entertaining. I think the waiter knew what he was getting himself into when he first met our party. This was such a great time you can only go in and experience it yourself.  Definitely visiting again on my next trip to Vegas. Love the pups painting at the bar!!!",

When I sat down in my chair I felt like I was eating the food from my lap. I'm a tall person and it's hard sitting in a large chair that's at a small table. I really enjoyed the chicken I got and mostly just ate the inside of the sandwich. If you love chips let me tell you there will be plenty to go around!   The service was good!! Yes plenty of TVs to watch the sports.  I am not sure if I would eat at this restaurant again!!",

    "text": "The fiancee and I checked out Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill on two consecutive evenings, which allowed us to thoroughly explore its cocktail menu as well as sample some food. Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill resides in the space formerly occupied Bradley Ogden, one of the early pioneers of chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas.  Given what came before in the space, GRP&G and its gastropub cuisine had a tough act to follow.  While GRP&G may tout itself as an English pub, from a design perspective, it looked like anything but.  No matter, since I wasn't there to dissect the interior design.    On the first night, I had the Pub Crawl ($15) made with Knob Creek Bourbon, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, fresh lemon, mint & black tea syrup.  Perfectly balanced, nicely sweet, but not overdone, it was a big winner!  On the second night, I left it in the hands of the talented bartenders to craft me something with whiskey, boozy and bitter.  I don't know what they made me, but it was a taste success.  We also had the Duck Confit Poutine ($13/12 for Total Rewards members), which may have seemed out of place at an English pub, but I found it tasty if a bit untraditional. The fries were hot and crispy reminiscent of McDonald's fries in a very good way.  They were topped with a relatively generous amount of nicely tender and moist duck.  Thoughtfully, a flavorful and thankfully not overly salty duck gravy was served on the side allowing you to sauce the dish yourself (and likely preserve the crispiness of the fries).  What seemed to be missing from the dish were the expected cheese curds.  Perhaps they don't use it in their recipe since it wasn't listed on the menu or maybe they didn't add very much and it was simply lost in the dish.  Nevertheless, cheese curds would've added a nice color, textural, and flavor contrast to the poutine.  Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was an unexpected good time.  However, it was the friendliness, professionalism, and skill of the bartenders in crafting our drinks on both nights that really made it memorable.  If Gene, either of the Adams, and/or Raul are behind the bar, you'll be in very good hands with regards to craft cocktails, great customer service and witty banter.  As for the food, it was good, but not on par with the drinks.  Hopefully, with the newly anointed Hell's Kitchen winner in kitchen, the food will come together more completely and coherently with the rest of the restaurant.  Regardless, GRP&G will be at the top of the list for drinks (definitely) and another go at the food the next time we're in town.",

We had reservations before the Rod Stewart show, and were originally seated at a pub style table with stools.  However, when we asked to be moved to a \"real\" table with chairs, they were accommodating and moved us without any issues.  Our waiter, and all the servers, were fantastic.  We never had to wait for refills and the food was served promptly.  We started with a calamari appetizer, and it was as good as calamari gets.  We had recently watched an episode of Kitchen Disasters where Ramsay was brutal on the chef that made greasy calamari, but this plate was perfect.  I followed that with the classic - fish and chips - and it was also as good as it gets.  My wife had the chicken Caesar salad, and was not disappointed.   The only negative was the noise level from the casino, but that's expected.  We would not hesitate to eat at the Pub again.",

Sarah was so complimentary of the restaurant and even commented that one of the dishes our daughter ordered was a dish that Gordan Ramsay himself eats when visiting the restaurant. (Shepard's Pie; which was awesome). Her recommended Gordan Ramsay special Good bye Blue Sky cocktail was soooo good. Her customer service outrageous! We had the Happy Hour Hell's Kitchen wings, Mini-burger and onion rings....The flavors, the tenderness the deliciousness. We have been to several restaurants while here in Las Vegas and the food has been great but nothing compares to the service and the food @ Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill. We were also celebrating one of our daughters 30th Birthday. They delivered a birthday dessert to us at the table which was unbelievable!!! Did I mention how outstanding Sarah was??? LOL   The service does not stop there. I had to exclaim how amazing Sarah was and how she simply made this restaurant beyond good. The manager Manny Ramirez was just as extraordinary. I am sad that we don't have this restaurant in Toluca Lake, CA. (There is a restaurant for sale on the corner of Rose and Riverside in Toluca Lake, CA....Just Sayin! Oh and if you do open there can you send this staff??!!)  Thanks for the great food and great service. We left wanting more and wanting to come back again!!!!   :)",

She didn't check on us and never refilled the drinks. The guy waiting the table next to us noticed we were waiting for a long time and came to ask for our order. We order steak, the steak was perfectly cooked. I had medium and my boyfriend medium well.  I had a terrible experience in this hotel, everyone is so rude.",

The food did take awhile to come out but the woodburned chicken salad with shrimp was definitely work it. The avocado dressing was the shizzle. My boyfriend had the club and he wouldve liked it more if the toast was cooked a little less. It was so toasted that it was cutting the roof of his mouth.",

Our waiter was a bit of a retard. First he forgot to bring a Pepsi which we needed to fix the horrendous Long Island iced tea we made the mistake of ordering. Then he told us the fountain drinks were completely out.   He spent more time gossiping in the back of the store, and not enough time watching the levels.  Really can't recommend this place.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with this: Vegas is really just not my thing, but I was hoping that Gordon Ramsay would be a little \"less Vegas\" than some of the other restaurants. I was wrong. Everything was over sized, over done, etc. The British theme was overkill, the prices were overkill (completely expected), but I have to say that the service here was excellent. We had an awesome server whose name is escaping me, but he was wonderful. I didn't care too much for the food, but my friends really liked it, so maybe this just wasn't my place. I was content with the fairly extensive wine list, especially for a pub like restaurant. I probably won't be back to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill but I probably won't be back to Vegas either.",

My husband got the truffle fries for an up charge. They were ok but not worth the up charge. His beef burger was good but nothing special. The warm pretzel appetizer we got was cold. I also don't think this meal was a \"good value.\" Way overpriced for what you get. I understand this is Vegas but $22 for a bacon cheeseburger is excessive to me.   I feel bad for making these criticisms because overall the dining experience was good.",

I had to send back my braised beef short ribs and risotto twice because the risotto was undercooked, somehow the risotto was worse on the second attempt.  Ended up eating nothing.  The manager never even came to the table to apologize.  My friends meals were also underwhelming.  Save your money and go to the food court next door.",

The food is average and a little on the heavy side, but not bad for a quick bite.   If you have a TR card, you get a couple bucks off.",

Sliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solid juicy sliders  Beef cheek stew has a decadent jus and the meat was tender as a butcher's heart.    HOWEVER!  Service was absolutely atrocious!  Our server was aloof and did next to nothing.  Obviously the busser hadn't been trained either, because as my buddy is chewing a piece of his steak, the busser comes over and asks if he was all through, while there is still meat on his plate too boot.  Nice beer list and yummy pretzel bread.  I would return and hope for a better service and make a final judgment after that.",

What a disappointment, hubs ordered a steak, very pricey, but very flavorless.  I ordered the tomato bisque, while it was tasty, it definitely wasn't worth over $13 for a bowl of soup. Waitress seemed uninterested in her job, only took our order, and gave us our bill.  She wasn't the one to bring our food, and never once checked on us during the meal to see how we were doing.  As my first trip here to vegas, I am going to say that all of these restaurants really are not great, but what do they care? 90% of their business is tourist! their money doesn't come from repeat business.",
