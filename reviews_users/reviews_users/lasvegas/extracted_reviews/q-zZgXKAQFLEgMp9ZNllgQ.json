We got the all you can eat for $25.95 and it was way beyond worth it.  the dragon roll was sweet and crispy, and the fish tasted very fresh.  we were so stuffed after eating, and the dessert was really great! I would recommend this restaurant so much!! Sadly, we do not live near here, or I would come very often! The waiters and waitresses were so polite and nice, it made me feel very welcome. The meal left me so delighted. Everything was cooked perfectly.  this is a great restaurant, worthy of five stars.  I am lucky to eat at this restaurant!!",

We had several people doing the all-you-can-eat meals and some just ordering entrees. The entrees were bigger than expected and the food selection from the AYCE menu was huge! I haven't been to any sushi place before that offered so many options with appetizers, skewers, nigiri, rolls, dessert and more in the AYCE menu:) The fish was fresh and the everyone loved the flavor of their dishes! This is the 2nd time I've been here and it hasn't disappointed us yet!",

Couple bucks more than the typical sushi place. But well worth it. Variety and size of the menu is more than enough. There's plenty of fun rolls and also a excellent selection of the more traditional nigiri style. I've been here more than once and each time is does not disappoint. I def recommend this place to everyone. This place has never been a let down.",

    "text": "Umiya is fantastic!!! Been here twice in one week for lunch.This has quickly become our new favorite sushi hangout in Las Vegas. We have tried several places, and Umiya is definately a step above the rest. The interior is warm and inviting. You are immediately greeted by the friendly hostess and sushi chef. There is seating either at the sushi bar, or traditional table seating for large groups, there is also tables available for couples. The AYCE option is the best value. Lunch is $22.95. The menu has a wide variety to choose from including lunch specials you can find their menu on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusmenuguide.com%2Fumiya-las-vegas.html&s=8ade711e32c2834c84e92749684cbec69bf889c6d592c7817c20efd9abb96429\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">usmenuguide.com/umiya-la...</a>. We have had different salads and starters such as Cucumber salad, Poke, Edamame(spicy or garlic spicy), Gyoza, Rib-eye steak, Japanese steak, paired with an excellent steak/teriyaki sauce, Bacon wrapped scallop skewers, marinated pork belly, and New Zealand green mussels. The Nigiri is very good, the fish is super fresh with just the right amount of sushi rice. The Rolls are simply the best I've had, because of how they are made. The rice they use is japanese sushi grade, and the chef uses just the right amount. They are rolled tight and never fall apart in your soy sauce as has been the case at other establishments. The sauces are a whole other story. Simply the best I've ever had. They are flavorful, not drenched just the right amount of sauce to compliments the roll, and use different sauces for each roll, complex in flavor and taste. Just makes you want to try everything on the menu. The food comes out fast and with excellent service. You also have 90 minutes to eat the AYCE. Most AYCE sushi restaurants only allow 45 minutes to an hour for lunchtime. Looking forward to also trying their AYCE dinner menu and sake and saketini cocktails which we haven't gotten around to yet. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "I really dont like trying out new sushi places especially if the group going is in the double digit numbers. For one too many people make a lot of issues with the wait staff as well as the kitchen. Sushi is a made to order type of dining experience and is best with just a handful of people. So far off the top of my head there's one place *cough*GOYEMON*cough that can handle an entire private room full of diners and not miss a single order as well as another *cough*KOMA*cough* where the waitress will go out of her way to remind and boss the sushi chefs to push the orders and correct mistakes.   So this was Chad's UYE and he threw up a whole bunch of recommendations on what we should all try out with the AYCE menu. Sure this sounds great and all but....  Problem is i didnt receive over half of the initial order i put in the beginning, eventually one out of many came but it was so late in the game i didnt really care about it any more. As for the others such as the oysters and the baby octopus...i guess they've gone through the doorway into Narnia out to take the one ring to Mt Doom before the Death Star blows up the planet because they sure as hell weren't anywhere in front of me or anywhere near me...  Service was...typical of any Asian restaurant. For being known as a hard working people, servers are fucking lazy...When we tell you in the beginning we want SEPARATE CHECKS it doesn't mean put everything one bill and let us play the 'oh well on the back of the receipt we put our names and how much we want charged to the card. oh wait we dont know how to divide up the service charge, the tax and everyone's individual drinks...oh my god this is getting complicated'. Server offered to split everything up and brought us back SEPARATE checks with all the tax and mandatory 18% all split up. Wow thanks bro you brought us what we originally asked for after you determined what a pain in the ass it was bringing an undivided check...Stupid of us to ASK for SEPARATE checks in the BEGINNING.   Drinks were okay, I had 3 Sakeinis which our server assured me was on the buy two get one free deal and they were. The best tasting was the Lychee one. Perfectly balanced between booze and Lychee flavor. The Peach and Pineapple were so bland and tasteless i might as well been drinking a bud lite. Not to say that both these drinks tasted like bud lite, i just mean there was no harmony no balance between the natural or artificial flavors of the fruit to match or complement the flavored sake they used.  As far as everything else food-wise i dont know i just dont know at all. Over half the things i ordered never got delivered. Most of dining experience was grabbing bits and pieces from others around me. Noticeably the spicy yellowtail hand roll was absolutely amazing when i first ordered it. They did it Goyemon style where it was chunks of yellowtail with spicy sauce drizzled all over it. It was so good or i havent had one in so long what ever it was pretty damn good so i decided to order another which was on par with the first as well as a spicy tuna hand roll. Wow the tuna was an epic fail in my opinion. Both the yellow tail and tuna were ordered as hand rolls, both were ordered spicy...yet two VERY different things were delivered other than the type of fish. As stated before the yellowtail was cubed and had sauce poured on top. The tuna was...minced into a paste with hot sauce and visible chunks of chilies in the mix. Totally not what i was expecting and was a bit spicier than i was willing to put up with. Good thing LJ was around...Big up to LJ!!  For the most part a lot of the nigiri was decently fresh especially the yellowtail.  Overall...i dont know I wanna give this place another chance by coming back with a considerably smaller group...but...i know other places that do a considerably better job.   Oh and dont get drunk here or try to get drunk here you might die of massive liver failure.   Yelp 100 - 012 of 100 Sorry Chad...",

    "text": "This was formally known as Kan / Kaizen Sushi. It's about $30 for dinner AYCE including tax. The hot tea is $2 each but during their Happy Hour it's buy two drinks get one free, so with four people it came down to $1.25 per. It's located on Flamingo and Arville in the plaza by the Starbucks.   My friends got here before I did, so they got us all a table, while of course waiting for me. It's a real nice place inside, loved the decor, very simple, elegant, and modern. There weren't that many people there when we were there, maybe around 20-ish people there including us. Service started promising, but as soon as the place started to fill up with only two servers, the service just went downhill. I didn't understand why they didn't have more servers on a Saturday evening during a dinner service. I was a little baffled by that.   Not sure if this matters, but this place is run by Koreans as is most sushi places in Vegas it seems. Started with the usual, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. The quality was mediocre, it wasn't that bad but it wasn't good either, they weren't really fresh in my opinion. The tamago and masago were okay as well, the tamago was definitely better than any of the fish. The Ikura, well didn't really look like regular Ikura to me, it was much smaller than normal, and the color was a bit off to me, which goes back to the question of freshness, it wasn't really fresh, as it tasted different from what I'm used to (and I usually order about 20 pieces of Ikura). What really got me was ordering the sweet shrimp, I nearly gagged on this and really felt nauseous eating it. That's a huge no no for me, they poured Ponzu sauce on it what seemed to me they were trying to mask the age of the fish, it was NOT fresh at all. One friend ordered Uni and well the presentation of it was bad, it looked horrible to say the least, and he was very skeptical of tasting it after my reaction with the sweet shrimp.   My friend got the rib eye and pork belly. They weren't bad according to him and for the pork belly though, it was dripping in oil. Like the plate was saturated with it. Looked good at least, but I wouldn't touch it without at least dabbing it down with a napkin. We also got a first kiss roll since it sounded it, it wasn't too bad, but I'm not usually a fan of rolls in general.  At the end we ordered dessert, two tempura ice cream and two ice cream, one order per person, and waited close to 15 minutes for it, before we cancelled and just left. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen, but it seemed under staffed all around for a Saturday evening.   The only real good thing I would say on the menu is everything else but the nigiri. They have an extensive AYCE menu, but it'll be a very long time before I come back here, if ever. It's worth a try, and I hope the experience of others are better than mine, but I do have high standards for sushi restaurant in general. It's worth a try if you cannot tell the difference in quality or freshness of fish as some of my friends cannot, but if you get easy queasy from bad fish, I would avoid it at least for now.",

One thing that is a downfall is the service isn't exceptional in terms of being attentive to their customers. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for just one plate, yes it's understandable that they probably have lots of orders but they had 5+ sushi chefs. Other than that, this place is great and I would definitely come again. My favorite rolls: Banana roll (if you're a banana lover, if not-stay away!) Red Rock is also really delicious. The Yakisoba was yummy and I also loved the touchdown roll is a must every time!",

We opted for the AYCE dinner which has a good sized menu to choose from (4 pages) plus dessert, came out to $60 for two people. Great price for great quality food.  I rarely ever eat raw food besides tuna, and even then I can't stomach too much of it. However, this place changed my mind. I started with their spicy tuna salad (delicious!) and got hooked. Pretty much everything I ordered after that had spicy tuna in it!  We also ordered crunchy lobster roll, oysters, tuna naruto, red mountain, baby octopus, shrimp tempura, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and king of the ocean. Everything tasted great, no complaints from me or my boyfriend, we loved everything.  TIP: most rolls can be ordered half sized so that you don't get full from one roll and you can try a variety of menu items. (5 or 6 piece rolls and the whole deep fried rolls can't be half sized)  Overall, great experience and will definitely return when I'm in town! If only they would open a location closer to home (;",

We ordered sushi alacart  and the price was reasonable. All the sushi came in a heavy Sriracha sauce or a vinegar sauce.   The fish wasn't super fresh tasting. The California roll was made from a crab salad mixture with a lot of mayo in it very disappointing. If I ordered all you can eat my expectations would have been way lower. The few pluses are the family style seating was fun, service was good, and if you don't know a lot about sushi you can get all you can eat and try a bunch of different rolls.",

Yelp rated Umiya well so I thought I'd give it a shot.  The layout of this place is amazing, and it should fit a lot of people even if it gets popular.  Here's hoping this place picks up, because it was dead when I went.  No complaints about the AYCE really, other than the limitations on quantity of certain items.  They even had similar unique appetizers to Goyemon, including crispy rice spicy tuna and pork belly.  My friend was a non-sushi eater and seemed pleased with the steak options on the AYCE menu, so that's also a major plus.  Oh, and this is probably the closest AYCE to the strip, which can be a HUGE plus.  I'll be back.",

The ayce is standard like most other places in Las Vegas and reasonably priced.  Pretty good selection of appetizers, rolls and nigiri for the ayce will make sure you get full.  Must haves include the salmon belly, Yuzu yellowtail and whatever specials they have for the day which is written on the wall board.  The restaurant is quite spacious and the picnic bench style tables are great for groups.  Usually I'll sit at the bar or one of the tables that are more private.  Ambience is very casual and energetic with music videos playing on a projector screen centered in the restaurant.  TVs located behind the sushi bar usually show sports center which is great to eat sushi and watch sports to me.",

I'm surprised that this sushi restaurant has such high reviews because compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants like Sakana and Yama Sushi, this is by far the worst AYCE sushi restaurant I've been to in the Las Vegas area.  First off, the server was extremely rude and rushed us to order right after we sat down and my boyfriend and I didn't even have time to look at the menu. After ordering once, we had to wave for a server to take our orders even though there were only four other parties in the restaurant at the time.  As for the sushi, the sushi rice was soggy and too wet. It wasn't even the sauce that made it soggy, the rice was probably just cooked with too much water. The salmon nigiri tasted chewy and did not taste fresh at as if it's been frozen for a long time.  We could tell that the restaurant was very unorganized because we kept receiving appetizers after we received our sushi rolls, which was really weird.  The only great thing about this restaurant is the amount of items in the menu, there's a lot to choose from ranging from appetizers, soups, salads, poke, and sushi rolls, however everything that my boyfriend and I ordered did not taste as good as we were expecting. I believe it was the bad sushi rice that ruined the sushi rolls for us.",

I'm not sure if this is just a Socal thing which is where I am from, but usually for AYCE sushi they limit you to the number of rounds you can order sushi but at this restaurant there were no limits for number of rounds which was great because it took off the pressure for what to order.  There was a variety of things to chose from other than sushi like tempura, udon, chicken, etc.  All the food tasted very fresh and I like that it comes in small portions as well.  You can also order the rolls in half rolls if you want to be able to try more rolls without getting full as quickly.  Would definitively recommend to anyone looking to satisfy their sushi craving and its nice that it's so close to the strip!",

    "text": "This. Place. ROCKS!   The little known secret about AYCE sushi joints in Vegas is that most of them have marginal sushi. Maybe that's why they don't care how much you eat because they aren't spending for the best quality or hiring great sushi chefs. So I was a little skeptical when I left the gym and decided that if there was ever a time to give it a shot it was when I was carb depleted and starving. :)   One fantastic thing about Umiya is that they let you order half rolls which gives you a chance to try a lot of different options. Let's just say that I took full advantage of this option! The big winners for me were AJ Tuna (unreal!), Orange Blossom (love the sauce), Yum Yum Crab Roll (perfectly named), Spicy Tataki Roll, Vegas Lasagna and Crunch Lobster Roll.   Another thing that led to the 5 Stars was the service. Friendly, prompt and they kept the food coming without much of a wait at all. Some AYCE waiters/waitresses act like you are stealing food from their children's mouths every time you order another item (OK, maybe only like they have to pay for it personally but you get the point). Not this place. They would have just kept it coming but everyone has their limit and I tapped out full, satisfied and happy that I found this place. And all for $26! Cannot beat that price for the quality of this food, volume of choices and awesome service. Bring your appetite but leave your AMEX Black Card at home!",

Also another bummer was that a lot of the good pieces on the menu were only one per person on the all you can eat... Kind of defeats the purpose.  DONT USE THE SAUCE THAT COMES WITH THE STEAK! Very ill tasting... Up to you if you want to try it but man... That did not sit well in my mouth.",

The place being as popular and busy as it is, it surprises me every time that our food always gets to us so efficiently. I'm talking about ALL of your food on your table in less than 10 mins after you order kind of efficient. Empty plates are always cleared away, drinks refilled without you even knowing. This is what you call attentiveness! I don't know how they do it!! Sushi Chef Lee was amazing! Thank you Umiya for bringing great sushi to Vegas!",

I told her I was not and my boyfriend was in the bathroom so she went away and came back another 2 times in the next 2 minutes while I was still sitting by myself. The second my boyfriend came back, before he even cracked the menu, there they were again! Seriously we felt like they were trying to rush us right out.  Once we ordered, they brought the rolls before the edamame so we told them to skip it since we were already half way done with our sushi anyways and they seemed to not understand why we wouldn't want to eat an appetizer after the main course. The sushi was ok but the pieces of cucumber in the rolls were big chunks, which is weird to me.  The icing on the cake is when they gave us the check and told us to \"take our time.\" Really? After all that?",

This is my first review of a restaurant. I felt that it needed to be recognized for the great service.   The food is made freshly  as you order. I normally do not like eating at an AYCE restaurant but I was in Vegas so we had to check one out. I was curious but reluctant at first however I was pleasantly surprised when the first orders of food came out.  If you're in town and have a big appetite for good Japanese food then drop on by whether it is in the middle of the day or late into the night. Highly recommend it!",

Alex (the owner) came up with all of the sauces for the rolls by himself so the sushi is different than all other places. Umiya serves such high quality fresh fish. Just try the sashimi salads and seared ahi tuna with AJ sauce to see what I mean.   We went last night for a birthday, and Alex and his crew made it an amazing night. They went out of their way to make a special roll and carved fruit sculptures for the birthday boy.  Not only is the food beyond delicious, the people are just so genuine.

The price was pretty decent (around $8-$15 per dish) but we had to go for an all you can eat deal since it would be a better deal for us and it sure was! The server was very friendly and provided us with a great service with a big smile on his face. He recommended us with all these great dishes that were on the menu. The food were incredibly awesome!! The chef is a truly master chef! Every dish that came out was a piece of art! He greatly dedicated his time and his master sushi chef skills in making our food looks to pretty and artsy. We were blown away by his creativity and his fast cooking skills.  Conclusion: At the end I would definitely recommend all my friends and family to try out this new all you can eat sushi restaurant. It is a great bang for the buck$$!  All you can deal  $25-29.99 (forgot the price) but it is for sure under $30 add $10 more for all you can drink (sake, beers)",

This place gets PACKED during peak dinner times so I would call to make a reservation if you can. The good thing is that this place is open till 2 am every night so if you want, you can come after dinner time to avoid the crowds.   We had a big group so it took us a while to get seated. But once we got seated, our orders came out really quickly. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and they all tasted pretty average except for the salmon skin. The salmon skin was burnt and we had to send it back. Avoid that if you can! Other than that, the fish to rice ratio was pretty good. It's nice when the piece of sushi hides the rice underneath it. There's a limit on the more expensive items such as sweet shrimp and uni (typical for ayce sushi spots).  Umiya is serviceable for ayce sushi but there are definitely better options out there.",

Yes I did give this place three stars. Only on food quality and variety but the biggest issue here is service. Service is not something I overlook regardless of the food. Seating is a nightmare. Empty tables covered in food remained for almost twenty minutes. Waitresses are overworked and do not come around often enough. Drinks stayed empty while we were forced to order large quantities to avoid a long wait. The kicker was we waited over an hour to be seated. While on large table parties of two were seated. While we watched smaller two people tables remain empty. So yeah foods fine but on a weekday the wait is not worth what you get.",

Even though the kids didn't eat raw fish they had plenty of food to enjoy such as grilled squid , fish and chix cutlet ,marinated beef and the list goes on. staff are very prompt .empty plates are gone and your drinks are filled before you know it. Especially the waitress who took care of our table - In-Sun  was a Star.  We loved all the dishes she recommended and she  knew excatly what we need for kids . really enjoyed the night and the food .",

And when that happens, you don't get your food as fast since they have to serve everyone else.   80% of the menu is good! Did not like the ribeye (one per person) since it was overcooked and tough. My girl loved the pork belly (sizzling oh yeahh) and thankfully it was nicely thin.   The ceviche was refreshing, the uni NOT good (not sweet/fresh), all the rolls great but beware,  they are filling and you will have leftovers that you must force down. The oysters were also a bit meh.   A must get also is the soft shell crab! we got more than we should have.   Great place to dine with a large party (just make a reservation early which they will call to confirm again).",

    "text": "I initially blew off Umiya due to the location. It's so close to the Strip, I figured half the high ratings were due to tourists from landlocked midwestern cities trying AYCE sushi for the first time without any frame of reference. A friend pulled me aside and told me to check myself, and insisted I go try it ASAP.  And the reviews are right, this place is awesome. I'm happy to eat my words, along with a large assortment of apps, small plates, grilled items, skewers, nigiri, rolls, and desserts. The menu has nearly anything you could ask for, and everything was done well from the baby octopus skewers to the macaron desserts and all the sushi rolls in between. The rolls, and particularly the sauces, are where they stand above the crowd of other options in Vegas- try anything with the unique tangy sauce. Favorite rolls include the King of the Ocean and the Orange Blossom.  The tasty food comes with funky izakaya style decor and incredibly attentive service: they use a team approach, so anyone nearby will ask if you want to add any orders. Dishes were whisked away within seconds of the food atop them being consumed, drinks never got less than a two thirds full, sushi came out within a couple of minutes of being ordered, and everyone had a great attitude and a smile.   In a city with so many sushi options that come and go or vary based on who is working behind the counter, Umiya is my new go-to. Whether you are going with traditionalists who order nigiri exclusively or those who love rolls or even one of those weirdos who don't like sushi at all, this spot will satisfy them all.",

    "text": "This place is more like 4.5 stars, which is well worth a visit every time I crave sushi when I'm in Vegas!  Came here last week with a bachelorette party of 8. They seated half of the party that showed up first so I guess you don't need everyone to be there to get seated (and I think we had reservations). 3 out of 8 girls did not get the AYCE (1.5hr time limit) and those girls regretted big time! I was definitely NOT one of the 3 girls. It was an easy pick to do AYCE sushi for the price (about $30/person including a drink, tax, and tip) which was a good deal to me!   What's better is the selection of food. You honestly want to eat so much from their menu, but you can't because your belly won't be able to take it. Choose wisely also because they supposedly charge you for any leftover food. In terms of taste, everything was tasty. I don't think I was disappointed with any of the items and when sharing with 4 other girls I honestly got to try so many food choices! After paying I totally remember that desserts come with AYCE, but the girls and I were ready to leave so we asked for our green tea ice cream in cups and the staff absolutely accommodated us and even gave us big scoops of ice cream! Yay!   The only reason this establishment did not get a perfect rating from me was because after we got our drinks, our initial waitress never came back to us. It took 10-15 minutes to actually flag down another waitress just to start our first order of AYCE. The second waitress was helpful though. Overall, great choice for AYCE sushi! Will be back when I visit sin city again which I hope will be soon! =D",

    "text": "AYCE sushi places have four criteria that I judge them on: their appetizers, their nigiri, their rolls, and how good their servers are. I don't have a favorite place, but I do have places I like to go depending on what I'm craving. This is definitely an appetizer place for me. That means their rolls and nigiri were just like everyone else, but they had a lot of unique appetizers that I liked that they carried or that I RE-ordered. I have to say that their uni was an honorable mention though.  So Umiya is right off the strip and just south of China Town so it's a pretty popular place. They have bar seating, some booths, and communal looking seats in the middle.   Most sushi places like this are gunna be very similar so I won't go into much detail. Price was just like everywhere else give or take a buck.   My main draw here was I loved how fast service was here. There are multiple servers bringing by orders and taking away plates. I eat a lot and my bar area never seemed too crowded because the servers were around constantly. Also many AYCE sushi places seem to come around less after an order or two, but they were constantly asking if we wanted to order more.  The space was nice, everything we ordered was good, and the staff was nice. Couldn't complain one bit.",

    "text": "This was the first time I walked into a sushi spot where we didn't get no \"irrashaimase\", sushi chefs all looking down, host's back facing us. When he did turn around it was to ask how many in our party. I normally don't prefer taking the whole crew out for an AYCE sushi, but on this night we did. It wasn't as busy when we entered in comparison to when we left. We were able to get seated pretty quick. The tables are more of picnic style seating where their tables are connected so be prepared to share another end with another couple/family.  Since the whole crew was present, that meant a highchair was needed. I quickly made a mental note to never bring the babies with me when coming here because the highchair is seated at the end of the table where they have this button system...which of course any curious toddler/baby turn into gumby just to press those buttons. Which....gets pretty annoying because the button isn't something you can move off. Therefore, you have to scootch the highchair more towards the corner of the table giving your kid an awkward seating and the potential to slam his/her face on that corner because he/she is throwing a fit over not being able to reach the button. Sigh.  Anyway, they have quite a selection for their AYCE. I found Umiya to be pretty good. I loved how their rolls/nigiris weren't rice/sauce overloaded. No fishy flavors which is a great thing! I personally ordered/tried their garlic tuna nigiri, crispy rice with spicy tuna, salmon lovers roll, vegetable tempura (a brocolli, zucchini, carrot), spicy garlic edamame (which wasn't spicy at all), spicy tuna toll, and their ribeye steak (which is like 4slices of steak served alone). The only thing I didn't really care for was their garlic edamame. I love edamame, didn't love it here.   The husband had uni, ebi, fried shrimp heads, salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail, unagi, tuna, salmon, and aji. Don't even get me started on the quantities. Lol. He thought they were all pretty good. Typical.  Anyway, they clearly have a system. Water was quickly refilled, plates were quickly cleaned off, service wasn't neglectful at all...out of all the sushi spots we have ever been to...I swear it felt like 5mins after we ordered...we were getting our orders. I connected my eyebrows a few times upon getting our orders because the turn around was ridiculously quick! At this point...it was busy so getting our orders quick and it being busy...that was quite impressive. I looked back at the chefs a couple times convinced there was an octopus working.   Even though we didn't get the greeting upon entering, my husband never getting his masago and me having to remind the waitress of an order and reminding one of the wait helps of the fork he was supposed to bring...we gave it a 4 because despite it all...thought our experience was pretty deserving of a 4.   We'd come here again but I don't think this place is as kid-friendly especially if you have one needing to be in a high chair and that damn button system thing. Okay, so the button is to call your waiter over, red button is for your check, and I completely forgot what the other colored button was for but I believe it's for drinks.   Definitely worth a try if you are looking to try a new spot. I'd say slip bringing the kids in so you can thoroughly bask in the ambiance and enjoy. But if you do bring the kids...highchairs have working buckles! For AYCE...kids ages 3-7 are 12.95 (half-off). Children 8 and up are full price. For desserts...their ice cream are unlimited except for the mochi. 1 each per person.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "All you can eat $26. Came in at 8 on Monday night. Waited 15 minutes and was seated at a nice table to ourselves. There are big tables where they seat 2 parties of 2 people and separate ends though. So call ahead if you do not want this to happen. Seared tuna sashimi is a must. Oysters, baby octopus skewer and crispy rice were okay. Salmon belly sashimi is great. Uni wasn't my favorite. We got half orders on all our rolls, which is an awesome option! King of the ocean and kiss of fire were my partners favorite. I liked the salsa dancing and salmon lover rolls. Dessert was tempura green tea ice cream and coffee/red bean  mochi, delicious!   Overall it was a decent dinner. For the price and the quality of the food I liked it and would recommend to people that are staying at Rio, Palms or if you are looking for sushi off the strip to avoid strip prices.",

There are 2 things i really love about this place.  1- call/service/receipt button located at the end of the table.  2- friendly and fast service. Every time ive been here they are always fully manned. During my last visit, which was a saturday night.. there had to be at least 5 chiefs at the sushi bar and at least 6-8 waiters running around.   Can't wait to go back!   I",

Out of the few times I have been here for dinner, there has always been a wait so I guess that just shows how popular the place is.   We ordered a bunch of items, but I would recommend getting the Yuzu Hamachi and the garlic tuna nigiri! Both are really flavorful and delicious. I ended up eating like 4 pieces of each lol! In terms of rolls I would recommend trying the orange blossom roll (it is my favorite at the moment). I really like the citrusy taste along with the crunch from the tempura. I also got to try the ribeye appetizer along with the soft shell crab. My friend got ramen (IDK why he did that), but it tasted okay. I'm pretty sure the vast selection of appetizers you can pick from is just there to bait you, so I would recommend just trying 1 or 2 and focusing most of your energy and stomach space on the sushi! I would also get the 2 cucumber wrapped rolls (I think one is called the Naruto and I forgot the other, but they are listed next to each other). I have always wanted to try the chicken katsu, but I think that would fill me up relatively fast.   You can also order more than 1 dessert item here so I would recommend the red bean and green tea ice cream scoop.   I would recommend checking this place out if you want a sushi place that has a decent selection of items that goes beyond sushi. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't do that, I will be generous and give them 4 stars lol!",

For what it was it was pricey and the yakatori was weak. Over-cooked and smeared in teriyaki sauce to make it palatable.   I have to admit I expected better or more affordable. If you got the dough to blow for mediocre sushi then go for it. It was my bad. I was in a bind and needed to eat ASAP.   I probably would either go to a more affordable place or go high-end.

They have a 90 min limit for AYCE but it took almost 30 mins to get our first order. To make matters worse, after placing our second order, the server forgot to input it into their system and checked up on us 30 mins later asking if we ever got our order. All in all, we ended up being there for over 2 hours and waited for long increments during our visit. Maybe if the service improves, this place would be worth rating higher.",

She then proceed to say if we wanted to sit at the bar it had to be separate seats, we told her there was three seats together, she says we couldn't push them together from the few feet away they were.

I called in for a party of 5 at 5:00pm, and the host said that there were a few open tables if we came now.  My party arrived within 15 minutes and we had to wait over 35 minutes due to the place being full already. They have a bar there and the bar seating was completely open, yet they sat 1 and 1-2 people parties at the 6 seater tables.  Since the NBA game was on, I went to the bar to order a beer and the guy asked if I'm waiting for a table. I replied yes and he said I can't sit at the bar. Really? Why not? I told him I would stand or get up when the 1st customer arrives, but he said in a Korean accent no.  Japanese food is not only the taste, but the top-notch service that goes with it. Avoid this place if you want authentic Japanese food.    I could only imagine the sushi is low grade that cats wouldn't eat.",

    "text": "So I actually want to give this place 3.5 stars...but alas I have no such option.  Why?! Do you the...oh so inquisitive minds, observantly inquire...well...something fishy going on with the rice. (Pardon the pun...I know, I know...corny)  Sushi rice is supposed to be big round sticky pressed vinegared grains of rice...well specifically Japanese White rice AKA \"Shari or Sushi-Meshi\"...basically something that specifically complements Sashimi turning it into Nigiri. (Can you tell I really, really, really like Sushi?) I'm not sure what this place uses...but the rice turns out strange.   The cuts of fish over the Nigiri are actually very good...fresh, perfectly proportioned over small servings of rice. But the rice itself is either not done correctly or it is not the right type of grain. I just tastes odd...like an inexperienced Sushi chef made it. One of the other mishaps here was the Rib-Eye I ordered. i requested medium rare, but got it medium...to well. There was nothing rare about it...no pink at all.   Other that that...hands down this is one of the better AYCE places I had the pleasure of dining at. I ordered a fairly long list of items...a bit tedious to list here, so I will only put what I thought was outstanding...but feel free to take a look at a pic of the bill I posted. The Sweet shrimp was very impressive! One of the best I had, considering this is coming from an AYCE restaurant. Succulent, meaty and actually sweet. They even asked me if i wanted the heads fried separately...bonus points!   The service here was very good, I was frequently checked upon, my Tea was refilled regularly and the waitresses were polite and courteous without being overbearing. I came here on a late afternoon, around 4:15, so I might have beaten the crowds...well actually I did, because there were only five other people in the restaurant...so maybe that might have been a factor to consider. All the food came out rather quickly. I was impressed at the promptness my orders were filled.  I will return to try this place again...",

Even though they were busy, they got us right in. Our server gave us suggestions and was quick and on the ball. We all had the all you can eat for 26 bucks a piece. Everything was fresh and delicious.  They have several unique rolls but the banana roll has to be my favorite. It is a little sweet so we had it for dessert.",

Ordered damn near one of everything on the sushi and nigiri menu and it was ALL amazing. The picnic-table-style tables are an amazing touch, great ambiance, wonderful vibes, really just a gorgeous experience, I will absolutely be bringing friends and family back here on every Vegas run I make from here on out.",

    "text": "So I've been essentially going to \"I love Sushi\", for 13 years. I do go some other places but \"I Love Sushi\" has been my go to place. I just started using \"Bite Squad\" for food delivery and I Love Sushi isn't a part of it. So based on good reviews I tried Umiya. I am very satisfied with the quality and taste of their food. It is excellent. It is much better than most sushi places around. They are obviously professionals and they know what they are doing. Looks like I have a new Sushi place when ordering delivery. Everything was very good. I ordered $150 worth of sushi and every dish was well prepared even for carry out. I knew nothing of this restaurant until seeing them on the Bite Squad app. I'm sure they do a good business there. I've been a sushi connoisseur for 30 years and this Umiya definitely passes the test.   Update. I ordered a second and third. I wasn't as impressed. The food was good. I did go to another sushi place called SAI in Anthem Vilage. The food at SAI was excellent. I will give Umiya a rest. I don't believe the food was consistently excellent.",

I don't know if we went in on a bad day or what happened. Most of their nigiri were unbelievable bad. Tuna, salmon, super white tuna, sweet shrimp and uni. None of them I would eat another piece. I refused to eat the uni because the color was brownish looking, very scary. I mentioned that to the waiter and explained it to her the reason I could not eat it. Another waiter came and explained to me the head chef has told him that's how the uni looking like recently. He came and showed me the entire piece to prove that they weren't giving me the old ones. I appreciated they took time and explained. However, I would still not eat it since it looked really awful.  However their rolls and cooked stuff were not so bad. The only thing I would eat from the place is hamachi kama( the yellowtail collar) , that was pretty good and most of the ayce places don't include that.  The service was not bad considered we had 11 people and that's the reason I gave two stars. If it weren't for the service, I would have given one star. Won't be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "I found this place a bit ago and after my second trip I am now getting to reviewing it!  I used to think I wasn't into AYCE sushi but more and more good places are opening up, it is no longer sushi waiting too long sitting in the little fridge by the unfriendly guys in front getting old before it's served sushi.  So I guess with this, yet another good AYCE, I'm into it!   When you walk in you are greeted with the usual loud \"Konnichiwa!!!\"  They have a nice area with tables in a kind of tented areas off to the sides, a large bar to watch the chefs and lots and lots of a picnic kind of tables all throughout.  Both times we were here there were men from Japan drinking their butts off hanging in the restaurant so if from the fish capital of the world love it why can't we?!   The AYCE menu is huge, the first trip we came with his mom and dad who were in town.  She eats nothing raw, so I put my preferences aside and we order cooked food.  In most cases I am left with the everlasting want for sushi until we head back to one, in this case I left happy and satisfied.  All of the cooked rolls and food were nummy!  Next trip was with people who eat it all, so we did.  As mentioned earlier they have a 90 minute limit ( I was done way before, but for you men or heavy eaters out there! ) My boyfriend and his friends enjoyed it all, no I truly mean it all! ;) lol  The staff was nice and fast the entire time and even though the guys ate a TON of food they never made us feel bad.    The quality of fish:  Good, in lines with some of the other top AYCE places in town, not as good as some of the best non AYCE places in town but what can you expect.  Next AYCE night I will be back great service and great food!",

Most sushi places tastes the same to me. So my criterion for good sushi is predicated heavily on atmosphere, service, and deals. On that note, this place was up to par with all three of my criteria.   It's a pretty place; modern, open, and stylish. It was dinner time and there weren't many people in there -- although, it was a Tuesday night. I like a social atmosphere, so being one of the few groups there was a downer.   The service was great, outgoing, and very accommodating. They even let us order one last roll out of the 90-minute AYCE limitation. One of the best parts of Umiya is the full bar, a rarity in sushi places.   The deals were the best part. Very competitive AYCE prices. Also, there were great sake deals with buy two, get one free (we had nine in total).   All in all, Umiya was a solid place which was perfect for a date.",

    "text": "First time ever coming here with a friend's recommendation. Have to say I'm not a fan. Came in with my boyfriend and his friends. There are basically 3 rules when eating here. 1) if you have all you can eat you can ONLY share with people who eat all you can eat.  2) if you don't finish they will charge you extra.  3) if there is a (1) next to the food you can't share it.   The food- not the greatest sushi I have had. It was decent. Had the caterpillar and it was complete mush. Any sushi roll we tried picking up with the chop sticks came apart instantly.   The service- everyone seems like they are in a rush here. They sit you down and rush you to get out. When they drop off the food they say it completely fast and literally run off. The WORST of it was the MANAGER. Her name is ASHLEY! She was completely RUDE. Any time she reached over she would elbow you in the face and walk off. She hit our friend twice in the face hard. When she dropped the food off she said everything fast and tried to run off. When we stopped her to repeat thinking it wasn't out food she says it again and laughs at us in a mocking way. We asked our server who the manager was and he said that Ashely was. We were shocked and in disbelief. We couldn't believe a manager would treat us like this.  I wanted to give this place a rating of 0 but our server TAYLOR changed my mind. He was friendly and made us all laugh and took his time with us when we were having problems deciding what we wanted to eat. We all hoped he was the manager or we want him to be promoted because he was professional and caring.   All and all I would never come back here again. I would recommend going to Oyshi on Sahara and Tenaya instead if you want good sushi and better service.",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a good sushi place to have dinner. Using Yelp we found Umiya near our hotel. We decided to give this place a try based on the reviews.  The place was not very busy for dinner during the weeknight. Jay and Krystal was our servers that night and they did a wonderful job of taking our orders and refilling our drinks. We never had to ask for refills they just knew when we needed it. They are very friendly and accommodating.  We went for all you can eat buffet style. For dinner it was 26.95 per person vs. 22.95 for lunch. The only difference is that for dinner you can order one Uni, sweet shrimp, and some tuna dish. But honestly not worth the extra four dollars you have to pay unless you can not make it for lunch or you love Uni. The food for a buffet was good and reasonable fresh. (I mean we are out in a dessert LOL). We enjoyed all the dishes except for Uni (not a fan of the slimmy sea creature=P_) and the Ginkgo (some kind of fried beans). The rolls were big and very filling. I would recommend to order one roll at a time and try lots of appetizers and udon/ ramen dish. This way you will not fill up on the rolls without getting the chance to try the other dishes. I would recommend this place.",

My daughter doesnt eat much for 4 yrs old so she ask if we want make her pay all you can eat or just regular , we decided just regular entree , she mention 3 times , she will charge extra if she see my daughter take a bite of sushi, and we said its ok, because we know she wont eat, and she took our order and guess what our order never come out correctly we missed our fried rice 4 order, yakisoba, miso soup, our sushi, and we kept asking and asking where is our foods but never came out . And the server just watching and stand around our table make sure my daughter didnt touch the sushi orders. At the end we still had 1 tray sushi . We were not done yet, we still eating and talking and she came again at our table and said she will charge us full price for what ever we dont finish it and we told her this isnt the first time we eat at all you can eat sushi and we aware about that and we arent finish. We still talking and eating. At the end we order ice cream 2 vanilla and 1 green tea, when the ice cream came my daughter touch the ice cream and she grabbed the ice cream and she said she will charge because my daughter not pay for all you can eat and we had to tell her she wont eat that ice cream because she has stomach problem thats why we dont pay for her, we just order tonkatsu soup for her. We really disappointed with the service and we disnt get the food we order. And that wasnt the first time every time we came there our food never completed",

They have the most diverse AYCE menu out of all of the sushi spots I've been to in Vegas.  However, they do have a lot of rules such as only one half-roll order per person, one dessert, and a number of menu options that are restricted to one order.  Their service was also friendly and excellent.  Overall a great place for AYCE that is clean, has plenty of seating, modern / trendy, and open late as well.",

The dinner price is $26.95 and for kids it's about $13.  Most of the nigiri I've tried was good, with standouts being the tuna, super white tuna, sea bream, yellowtail and eel. Other items on their menu that I'm a fan of include their gyoza, the yellowtail lover roll, and crispy rice with spicy tuna. Their oysters and pork belly are decent and worth ordering again.  I wasn't a fan of the seared tuna in AJ sauce or the Hawaiian roll.  The interior is cool with the long communal tables and benches. It also seems to be easier to get a seat than other AYCE places around town. The times I went I've never had to wait, which is perfect when my patience is running low, I'm hungry, and all I want to do is stuff my face.",

My friend was so excited at the large fish portions in some of the hand rolls. They also have no-rice rolls if you're watching your carb intake. In addition, I'm gluten free because I have Celiac disease and while I'm not sure if they have Tamari available (I usually bring my own anyway, just in case), there were enough gluten free options available to fill me up!!

    "text": "Umiya has been one of those really nice sushi places I would always look forward to going. I have been to Umiya probably about close to 10 times so far. However, given the recent service I encountered here, I will not be coming back again. Given that it's my dad's favorite sushi places, I still won't go. Their quality seems to have gone down from years before and everytime I come it is always so crowded and takes forever to wait for a table. It's not a very spacious restaurant,  and with so many customers it really sucks having to wait inside shoulder to shoulder sometimes.   My recent experience with them was probably one of the worst. They had my family (all 5 of us) sit with a couple of loud and noisy people who I believed sat there at least longer than an hour already. They did not give us much room and the person next to me had THE LOUDEST voice EVER! I was getting a headache and my ears were starting to actually hurt from his voice. I eventually had to switch seats, but that didnt stop them from continuing. Eventually more of their friends came and sat down making for even less room to sit. I couldn't take it anymore and had to ask one of the workers there to move. Looking around, I saw larger spacious tables with only two or three people sitting there while my family had to sit with 8+ people in a small crowded table. That was unacceptable and unfair! Good thing I spotted an empty table behind us where the workers there eventually allowed us to move to. At first they were hesitant to even let us move, which I had no idea why. After we moved, the extremely loud group doubled in size as more of their friends came and joined them.   However, being able to accommodate us in that is why I gave them another star.   The service being as they were so busy that night, was pretty quick surprisingly. Umiya really never disappoints in that area, which is a good thing. However, they do forget some of your orders so you have to remind them a few times. By that time, you're already full and it's not worth it to bother them anymore. Maybe that's their strategy?? A way to slow down the workflow a bit?    The sushi was good, but the quality like I mentioned has gone down. It is not as high quality as it was before (maybe a year or two ago). The seasoning and flavors did not mend well together with the fishes. The rolls seemed messy at times and did not show effort in making the sushi. However, I will say it is still better quality than other sushi places I've gone too, so Umiya is not all THAT bad if you're a first timer there, or do not mind those little things.",

The problem I have with this place is it is not accommodating for single people. They have a \"bar\" you can sit at but every woman by herself knows when you sit at a bar you will have creepy guys come to try to sit next to you and hit on you. They don't have single tables, instead they have these very long 15 foot tables that you see at summer camp. I don't want to come to a restaurant to eat and be forced to sit next to some creeper. The last time I did sit at the bar I ordered the all you can eat menu and only got 2 1/2 small plate dishes in the 90 minutes I was there because the service was so slow. They also sat me next to the middle of the bar where the cooks were handing things to the waitresses so I had people reaching over me the entire time I was there.  Edit: literally 2 minutes after I posted this review some guy came up to try to sit with me and get my phone number. I came here to eat and not get picked up.",

Yes this place is busy however they have a system where instead of writing your name down for your table, you give them your name and number and they will TEXT you when you table is ready! Super convenient and save you from waiting at the door or Incase your table is done before the estimate time. Our service was excellent. Everything from our server (Curtis D)to how fast our food came out and how fast they remove your plates I was impressed. As soon as you are done with your plate they removed it almost immediately. Food was very delicious I tried a lot of things on the A.Y.C.E. menu and everything tasted fresh to me especially the nigiri. I even tried the oysters and they were delicious! I've never been to a place where they have fresh oysters on the menu even tho it's only 1 order per person. Loved that they have udon and ramen! Can't wait to come back and try both! This will now be my go to spot for A.Y.C.E.",

I'm not a big fan of rolls but their banana roll was amusing. I believe it is my had avocado, shrimp tempura, and a sweet piece of banana on top. And the usual sushi rice of course.  Their oysters were alright, not too bad but definitely need more lemon and sauce. Some were a little bit fishy though. Bigger than regular oysters FYI.  Poke salad was pretty good, but the cerviche was okay. Nothing to write home about. People were also raving about the seared sashimi but I thought it was alright.   To end the night, the pineapple sherbet and pistachio almond ice cream were the best finishing touches on a quite satisfying meal.  The staff was also super nice, fast, and hard-working. Bless them cuz it was packed on Christmas day. About an hour wait at 6:30 pm. Would definitely recommend when you need that sushi fix.",

The only thing that slightly annoys me is that the appetizers usually take longer than the food to get to you.

My friends were able to get the ayce which was nice because they were really hungry.   We got seated immediately and the ayce plates came out really fast! Everything looked so good I was really tempted to try, but I abided by the rules. I asked my friends and they said the quality was really good, but they use a lot of rice. I saw the nigiri and they do use a lot of rice compared to other ayce places (so be careful when ordering too much).

For a AYCE place, its relatively small, mostly long benches in the middle, and some smaller seating around the sides of the restaurant.    Price for AYCE is very reasonable at $26, considering its triple that price in vegas buffets i would say the price is excellent.    In terms of food selection, its pretty deep in addition to sushi, there is grilled skewers, fresh seafood, and good dessert options.    Overall quality of the food was good to excellent.  We enjoyed everything we tried and the staff was very attentive and friendly.    If your looking for a place off the strip at a good value, this place is worth checking out.  It gets pretty busy at night though so you may wait for a little.  Would definitely recommend this place.",

I ate at Umiya Sushi Twice!   Umiya has a great AYCE sushi menu and is open late. Everything i ordered was amazing! Its located off the strip so i would say its decently priced, Dinner $25.95 (3pm -closing)  Its awesome because if you do a Yelp Check in you can even receive a Free Gift- an umiya sushi mug.

They played catchy pop music both in English & Japanese and that was fun. Their decor was what interest me the most as it wasn't the typical sushi restaurant with basic seating. You just gotta see it for yourself. Awesome! We were able to order half rolls on ALMOST everything on the menu, which gave us the opportunity to try basically everything. We ordered 3-4 rolls at a time to keep a steady pace, and we received our orders within 5 minutes. I'm only giving 4 stars simply because we also ordered soup midway into our visit & we asked for it probably 3 times. They just kept forgetting about it. All in all though, I would come again.",

I love the Lobster Crunch roll, vegetable tempura, soft shell crab, and so much more!  For two people, the bill came out to 68 bucks including tax and tip for all you can eat.   Orders come very fast as you order them. Some special items you can order only once. Besides rolls and nigiri there is a selection of hot and cold apps, skewers, entrees, and noodles.  Overall I really enjoy this place and would come back if I'm super hungry and craving sushi.",

    "text": "Review number 1000 for Umiya woohoo!  I've been here twice now, and I gotta say that overall this is my second favorite ayce sushi place in Vegas (Sushi-mon on Sahara still being number one on my list). Most ayce sushi places that I know of have a 1 hour time limit, but the time limit here is a generous 90 minutes. $20.95 for lunch (11AM-3PM) and $25.95 for dinner (3PM-Close). They have a broad selection of items from ramen/udon noodles, to grilled skewers, ribeye steak (1 order per person), miso marinated pork belly, and a vast array of nigiri and rolls. Their fish is pretty fresh, and I like how they don't put a lot of rice in their nigiri. However, the service was a bit inconsistent today. One of the servers was really accommodating and on top of our orders, but it seemed like some of the other servers there were trying to rush us out. My buddy was eating his ramen, and even though he wasn't done, they kept trying to take it away lol. Also, he literally asked for his salad like 5 times before it finally came out. Not sure what happened there...  I would say that coming here for lunch is definitely a bargain at $20.95. Even if you're not a huge fan of sushi, they have enough non-sushi items that will compensate for that price.",

    "text": "Went here last night with a group of friends for a going away dinner for a coworker. The moment we sat down the servers assisted us right away considering that it was busy. Do keep in mind that they will not seat any party that is incomplete, everyone in your party needs to be present upon being seated.   This review is a combination of my last visit a year ago and recently. Both times I came here was in a group of friends/coworkers. The cool thing about this place is the communial seating arrangement with outdoor picnic tables and chairs with an industrial like ceiling. Great when dinning with a group of friends because they are able to accommodate sizable groups. One group had 14ppl, another table had 12ppl and there was a mixed amount of 6-8ppl at other tables during our visit.  Our small group of 4ppl went with the AYCE menu with the exception of 1, who opted to order individual items. This place is a good option to introduce someone who is not to familiar with AYCE and Japanese food.  Some of the few items we enjoyed: -Baked Green Mussels-Fresh and seasoned just right with the a good amount of cheese. \"Oceany\" taste according to two of my friends.  -Hawaiian & Firecracker roll was really good and left a lasting impression, considering a few of us who don't do Nigiri.  -Tempura Ice Cream & Mochi Ice Cream was good.  In my personal opinion, I would given this place 3.5 stars because their Nigiri didn't have a fresh consistent taste with a few a bit dry ones but there were times it was good. Since Im biased with Nigiri opposed to rolls.  The reason for my 4 star rating is based on the attentive service, because there isn't really a set server. More of a group of servers working as a team. We had a few order takers, food runners, bussers and the manager occasionally checking up on us. The great thing our group appreciated was that they were able to split the check in 4 individual checks, which made it easier to pay with less confusion. This option is not common in many Asian restaraunts.",

We ordered ala cart instead of the AYCA option because we didn't figure we would eat $75 worth. Maybe if a person was there for quantity instead of quality rolls I would have given it more stars.  Our server did a good job checking on us. The fish was not very fresh tasting and everything had  a strong rice vinegar taste to it. The only spice I really tasted with sriracha. There was nothing \"fancy\" such as sesame seeds on top of the spicy tuna etc. I felt it was a pump it out and get it to the table kind of place.",

    "text": "I definitely got my money's worth here for $26.95 AYCE it is totally worth it here! A couple friends and I wanted to check this place out for dinner-- and we were ALL glad we did.   As everyone has been saying, they do have a large selection of appetizers, BUT I feel like most AYCE sushi restaurants do now-a-days, such as Oyishi  What I can say that stood out was the fact that they had skewers in their AYCE and man did we order a bunch of the bacon wrapped scallop skewers. They were A-MAAZING. They put a little too much eel sauce on it, but I got over that quickly.   We also ordered the ** seared tuna sashimi with AJ sauce** totally recommend this. So zesty with flavor. Too bad it's only 1 order per person, but that's the reason why. womp womp womp.   Baked mussels were alright, when they reached us, they weren't super hot.  I didn't like the fresh oysters we got, they tasted really fishy and straight from the ocean. But hooray they are included in the AYCE.   I really like crispy rice, the texture is so chewy and crisp, I love it. They have a crispy rice tuna appetizer, which I loved so much, that we ordered 2 orders of it.   We ordered a TON of sushi rolls. They were all made to perfection. Baked rolls were  baked perfectly and delivered hot. While the regular rolls weren't wrapped with too much sushi and were bite size and they looked like they were delicately rolled.   I recommend getting the **snow white roll** and the **orange blossom roll**   I also ordered a mackerel at the end of all of our sushi roll rounds which was a mistake because it was a hearty portion. They give you the WHOLE mackerel.   Dessert option is kinda bleh, as you only get ONE from the entire dessert list. It's your average dessert list from sushi restaurants (ie: tempura ice cream, mochi, etc)",

The food is pretty good. I like the hand rolls the most. They were loaded with fish and a fair amount of rice (good ratio). I also liked the fried rice with spicy tuna. $30 is not bad for all you can eat dinner. They had good variety of rolls and even steak for those of that don't want all raw fish. Good sized picnic like tables hold a lot of the dishes as they come flying out of the sushi bar. I was impressed at the speed of the orders coming out. All freshly made. The rice was still warm in the hand rolls.  I would give more like 3-3.5 stars for the taste of the food. But the service really makes this place hard to dislike.",

I dragged my boyfriend from his comfy nest and persuaded him to join. He and I both have great places we enjoy sushi and Kaya is one of them. (One of the best in Las Vegas) After trying Umiya it has immediately become my favorite. Although the service and dining experience as a whole is very very fast, I enjoyed the food and the attentive service. The types of rolls were damn near specialty and all looked so amazing!!! You know when you try \"All You Can Eat\" just to try bits and pieces everything and share? Well, we ordered doubles of the same thing and literally stuff our faces! And everything was unique and tasty! It was a taste bud overload! I don't remember much of the names of rolls but my favorite was the roll with the lightly fried banana on top. Like, who thinks of that?! It was delicious!!! I ordered it twice!!! From now on I will recommend Umiya over Kaya, but both are unique in their own ways. I lean more towards Umiya since they have an edge. A very sharp one atm.",

Staff is on top of tables,they fill water and drinks without having to be asked or looked for!  There is nothing worse then being a thirsty guest, especially in Las Vegas. Our staff was also friendly and continued to check on us throughout our meal.  Most places I've been to wont allow someone in a group of  AYCE menu goers to just order off the the regular menu.  Umiya Sushi does and it was great.  Everyone got exactly what they wanted and the food just kept coming.  Full of flavor, sweet rice, fresh ingredients and all of the staff were in complete harmony with each other.  No hiccups, no worries and an overall great dinning experience.     We will all be back!  Thank you for a wonderful time and feeding the bodybuilders in our group!    - Cara",

My party of 10 seemed to really enjoy the food and the servers were nice even if they did forget a few things. The caterpillar roll, rainbow roll, crunchy rice roll, samurai roll were all decent. We enjoyed the seaweed salad a lot, along with salmon skin hand rolls, tempura, and multiple desserts of mochi and ice cream. :)",

    "text": "Can I start out by saying that it's been a long time since I left a restaurant feeling more than satisfied about their customer service game?  This wait staff is COMPLETELY on point.   You have one designated waiter/waitress that is incredibly attentive as to when you need to order, what you need, etc.  But you also have the ENTIRE wait staff coming to check up on you to make sure everything is going well.  I don't think I've gone more than 5 minutes without someone asking me if I need a refill, need to order anything, or if everything is good so far.  It might sound annoying, but it really isn't.  They do it so casually, it doesn't even bother your meal.  I am completely loyal to this place now specifically because of how AMAZING their staff is.  Also!  My waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  She picked out two great rolls for me when I asked which one she thinks I should get.  She took her time to go through all of the options for me and made sure that I would love it.       Food portion:  I really LOVE their meal portion for AYCE.  You get one complete roll, but the rolls aren't fat.  They're cute size.  So you don't feel overwhelmed with one roll.  This is great with AYCE, that means you can order a lot more rolls and still be able to eat them all.  There isn't a lot of rice on their sushi, which gives you room to eat a lot more.    If you see my past Sushi reviews, I tend to lose loyalty if the service is terrible.  Needless to say, this place has gotten my loyalty and I will definitely be back.  How I know that this service isn't a fluke:  I overheard an experienced waiter teach a new waiter to make sure to always be attentive to all of the tables.  Not just his, but all of them.  I heard him go over how if you see a dirty plate, you take it away immediately.  You make sure you go around and ask if everyone is doing okay.  Refill their drinks, etc.  That's how I know that they take their customer service serious and that this isn't a once in a full moon service.  This is type of service that they strive for.  And they're damn great at it.",

The menu isn't overwhelming and has lots of pictures! It is all you can eat! It is timed from the time you put in your order. You get 90 minutes to order all you can eat. Best thing about this place is that you can order half rolls. I totally take advantage of this because I get to try every roll on the menu. They have some very unique sushi, And they even have steak to order (one order of steak per person).   This place has a dim light ambience. Great date place. Also great for a group of friends!   It is $20.95 for all you can eat lunch. (From open til 3 pm), and $25.95 for all you can eat for dinner. (From 3 pm til closing).",

They were uber attentive to us, but it wasn't packed that night so I can't judge if this is how it is every night.  The rolls were delicious, we also had some hot garlic edamame and nigiri. Very fresh.  The rolls were quite intricate and I wish I had a bigger stomach to try more, but alas, AYCE sushi always ends.  I did check in on Yelp for the free sake, totally worth it.  The ambiance was great, fun music with the music videos but they also had the football game on.  I loved the interior and it felt more modern than some of the other AYCE places and also more open. Although I wasn't a large group this time, this place is a much better fit for a large group than other places I've eaten at.",

They have entree stuff listed with the AYCE menu such as steak and chicken, which is great. Also, they have ramen.  The appetizers included in the AYCE are more than the typical gyoza. I had a \"Who's Your Daddy\", a fried ball of shrimp and other stuff. Delicious. The spicy rice cake on a skewer? Must have for anyone that likes spice.  The huge negative here? The kitchen time is absolutely horrible. Throughout the whole time, the food coming out was pretty slow. But towards the end, I ordered one last order of tempura shrimp and a spicy rice cake skewer. Our friend ordered dessert, and my fiance wanted to wait for me to get my order before placing our dessert order. For the scoops of ice cream that our friend ordered, it took at least 20-25 minutes. My food never came out. We asked about it, and they apologized and said the kitchen claims it's coming. We had to be somewhere in the next 20 minutes, so we left without my last order. Our friend did let us try some of her plum wine ice cream, though, and it is a MUST. I don't care if you hate plums or wine. You have to try this.",

Yes, the fried rice. The chicken fried rice was really really delicious. Great flavor, and the chicken was fried on the outside. I cannot express how delicious the fried rice is. It makes no sense but it just is.   I also would have to point out that this place is most likely not run by Japanese people. They hand you the bill before all the food on the table is gone which is less than cordial. No Japanese restaurant run by actual Japanese people would ever think of treating a customer that way.",

For nigiri, a couple of my tuna and albacore orders didn't look that fresh. They don't have a huge selection of rolls, but they're still ok.  If you like AYCE for the non sushi selection, they have pretty good stuff. I really like their grilled salmon and this tofu dish. I actually really enjoyed the tuna poke. I did like that they had more variety for their ice cream mochis than other sushi restaurants.  As for the ambiance and the customer service, It was pretty good! The decor is pleasant and modern looking. Our waitress was very nice, polite, and attentive too.   Overall, this place is alright, but it's not my favorite. The good thing about this place, though, is if you check in on yelp, you get a free soda or small sake!",

We ordered ala carte for the 4 kids (not worth the money having kids doing the AYCE).  They enjoyed their favorite rolls.  The 4 adults ordered AYCE and it was delicious! The menu had more than just sushi, but beef steak (very petite and juicy, which was perfect), raw oysters, baked mussels, soft shell crabs, desserts, and more.  Our waitress, young Asian lady, was efficient; we did not need to flag her down; she always know when to come by our tables to take more orders.  We will definitely come back when we are in Vegas and we have recommended this place to our friends and families.",

I really liked their baked mussels and their bacon wrapped scallops. Also their tuna poke is probably the best around since I'm really picky about what I like ! I tried their oysters and they're really fresh and taste so good !  Moving onto the main course, the AYCE sushi ! I love love love sushi, but it was just alright to me. I had really high expectations, but I was disappointed /: everything tasted so bland and simple, not much flavor to them. And although they had a wide selection, I didn't find anything interesting to try out. Probably the good ones were the spicy rolls, but I didn't try since I wasn't feeling something HOT. Ohwells.... Oh ! And they burnt my rice when making their baked rolls, so be aware !!!!  Overall, I love their appetizer selection. The AYCE was fresh, but not enough flavor to satisfy. And dessert was good, but their tempura part of the tempura ice cream was not good at all for me.   Not sure if I'll come back /: sorry, I'll be taking my money elsewhere.",

Ive been here 3 times now and sadly the best part of this place is their hot dishes. Bacon scallops are delicious, even though they are the sizs of a nickle. The sushi was a huge disappointment my last visit a couple of days ago. Like alot of other reviews say, the fish just doesnt taste that fresh like its been sitting at room temp for too long. And the unagi is a bit on the rubbery side compared to good fresh and properly grilled unagi that is flaky and delicious. The salmon belly honestly had a sour aftertaste which totally ruined my appetite for raw fish from this place. The salmon roe is way saltier and fishier than at sushi twister. Probably wont be back for a while. I also find it funny that all the employees yell japanese greetings even though they are all korean but thats beside the point. All the sushi chefs are young korean dudes, and you can tell they dont put enough pride into their sushi here.. the taste just isnt nearly as good as the competition.",

I remembered a short wait time, excellent service & fresh & delicious food. This time we had a lengthy wait time, less than mediocre service & food & sushi especially did not seem as fresh. For a party of 9 we were forced to cram onto a small table & had to wait over 30 mins. to use an additional table even though one was available the whole time. It seemed like the waiters were definitely consumed in the busyness of what was going on in the restaurant & we definitely felt it as we were very rushed. They forgot some of our items toward the end of our night & then ended up bringing them out with our check. They also cleared off the rice & miso soup my niece was working on when she went to the bathroom without asking the remaining party if she was done. Not sure if we'll go again on our next visit to Vegas but good thing Vegas has a wide variety of AYCE sushi spots.",

Service seemed promising at first but as soon as they got busy for the dinner rush, it went downhill FAST. They should have staffed better on a Saturday evening, and dinner for that matter.   The place is run by Koreans by the looks of it (if it matters to any of you). The tuna, salmon, and yellowtail were actually pretty good, IMO. Uni and sweet shrimp were pretty awful.  I didn't try the sweet shrimp nor uni personally but my friend wanted to gag on the sweet shrimp. I liked the tamago and masago. For dessert, they have tempura ice cream, regular ice cream, mochi ice cream, and banana split. Didn't get my spicy tuna salad either :(.  It took awhile to order when it got busy so it also took awhile to get our orders. We even ordered dessert (1 item per person) but never ended up getting them cause it took too long so we just left. We had already paid by then.  To sum it all up, for the price and my first experience, I will most likely not be coming back. I didn't try any of the rolls personally since I can only eat so much in one sitting. I think the sushi itself wasn't too shabby (for the ones that I tried) but the overall experience was just bleh. Hence the 3 stars as opposed to 2.  Their AYCE menu is pretty extensive, though. So if you can eat a lot, you can try a whole bunch of shiznits. Like pork belly, ribs, skewers, and salads among other things. I wouldn't say to not give it a chance, but just saying my first experience didn't make me keen on going back.",

I really liked the yuzu seafood ceviche, baby octopus, lobster roll, jalapeno poppers, seared Tuna Sashimi, and the Lisa Lisa roll. There was a large variety of seafood, nigiri, ramen, poke, desserts, and rolls included in the buffet deal. The menu also specifies what's in the rolls and which items are raw for conscience eaters.  Disclaimer: make sure to order what you can eat. They charge extra for leftovers.  I highly recommend this place. There's both quality and quantity for a good price. I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

They had 3 long tables waiting for us. Awesome.   Our waiter Tony took control right away and sectioned us into 3 groups of 6. He started getting orders for each group and he did not miss one order.   We ordered do much food, these are the highlights: The Best: *Tsubu Gai (giant clams) super tender and clean tasting. *Yuzu Hamachi - Yuzu definitely elevated the freshness of the hamachi.  *Salmon Belly - yum *Uni - creamy goodness.  *Fresh Oyster - I had 6 of these by myself YUM!  *Bacon & Scallop Skewer - small, but wow was it good.   The Good: *Tuna Poke *Marinated Pork Belly *Rib Eye Steak *Baked Mussels *Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream   The Bad: None  Price was reasonable. Comparable to other AYCE I've been to.   Tip: free soda with Yelp Check in.   Our last family dinner on this LV trip turned out to be the best. They accommodated a big group and provided good food and excellent service. Go try them out, it's definitely worth a visit =)",

There are so many choices ranging from noodles, nigiri, special rolls, soups, appetizers and desserts. The rice to nigiri portion is A-ok! There is not much rice to it. My favorite is usually the Tamago (egg), and Masago (fish egg).   The service is ok. They sometimes forget to give you the rest of the order in which you just order it again. The restrooms are kind of ghetto....... Yeah. Let's leave it like that. When you own a restaurant or business, best to make sure the restroom is presentable and smells good. Thats the one place we as customers need to go when nature calls.   I do hope to make a return!!!",

    "text": "Never realized that there was a hidden gem down the street from my house! Plenty of parking in the plaza, but it has few street lights and looks kind of sketchy from the outside. But never judged a book by its cover because the insides atmosphere is sort of like a club! Good music and dim lighting! I felt super rushed eating because I felt that all the servers were running around. Food came out quickly and dirty plates were taken away promptly.   I like the appetizer options here as they offered a lot of things you wouldn't normally see in other sushi restaurants, at least none of the ones I have been to! My friends gobbled a plate of shishito peppers (limit one order per person), the plate had quite a few peppers on them. I did not try them but my friends said they're good, and taste like bell peppers.  THE GOOD:  - oysters (limit one order per person). Quite meaty and clean! I didn't have a mouthful of sand or bits of sand in my mouth after eating it. We were all surprised at how big the oysters were. - baby octopus skewers. They literally give you a tiny one - soft shell crab. I was surprised at how good this was! You can literally eat the entire thing without having to spit anything out. We wanted to order more since it's limit one per person I think, but we were saving room for our rolls.   THE EHH - chicken skewers look nothing like the picture on the menu. There were hardly any vegetables on the skewer. Maybe one piece of onion or bell pepper to separate the chicken pieces.  - Ginkgo has a lot of Heath benefits and it came in a bowl with about 10 or so. Tasted sort of like boiled peanuts - bacon scallops. They gave us 2 pieces and the bacon was too crispy/overdone.   I'D SKIP - mussels were overcooked and a bit too chewy IMO.  - yuzu ceviche (limit one per person): I would not order this again. The fish pieces tasted really off and they were kind of mushy.  - ribeye was very small. We got 4 small slices and it was over cooked.   You can't go wrong with any of their rolls but the nigiri had way too much rice. I'm used to 1/3 of the rice they out in the nigiri but the quality of the fish wasn't bad. Our favorite was the eel and salmon belly.   Their dessert options are kind of limited. They offer tempura ice cream (green tea or vanilla) which is a single scoop of ice cream. It's not very big, so I would recommend not sharing! They also offer different mochi ice cream flavors including red bean, green tea, strawberry and others. And, ice cream scoops as well.   If the rice ratio is a big deal for you then I wouldn't recommend coming here. But the upside is that they do offer a variety of appetizers and the food comes out super quick! Plus service is great.",

The all you can eat menu is large, lots of appetizer, nigiri and roll options. The menu goes beyond sushi, we did not look at that part. Nigiri pieces are small. Tuna poke is good. We enjoyed all of the rolls we ordered, trying a variety.   Communal large tables and benches where you share the table with others. Makes it very accommodating for large parties of people.   Service is fantastic. There are plenty of servers working, walking around refilling water and clearing plates. Not once was our section of the table cluttered.

    "text": "When I saw a 4.5 rated AYCE sushi restaurant right across the street from our hotel, Palms, I knew my family and I had to go.  On weekends they open at 12, so my parents and I made it by 12:10. Good thing we came early, because this place gets PACKED! At 12:10, there was half of the room already full with more people flooding on in. There were only 2 servers during opening which made service really slow at first, however, once more servers started their shift, it got more consistent. One thing to keep in mind is that all the servers work together, you're not just assigned one. We totally kept trying to get the attention of the first person who took our drink orders before eventually realizing that every server attends to every table. Wooooopsss!! Don't make this mistake y'all, you'll save yourself a lot of frustration lmao.  $21 all you can eat sushi, yes plz. My parents and I ordered an assortment of items from both the sushi bar and the kitchen. There are some items that they only let each person order one of, but a majority of the stuff is free for all. Although the pieces weren't super fat, I was honestly impressed by the quality of the nigiri to the point were the slice size didn't bother me, especially since you could just order more. The salmon (sake) was extremely fatty which made it all the more delicious! DEFINITELY skip the seared albacore though. This was the one dish that I was very disappointed in. Other things I would recommend getting include the poke!! The tuna chunks were really thick and seasoned very well. I also really liked the grilled mackerel and grilled squid from the kitchen. Polished off our palettes with some yummy green tea ice cream too.  Overall, I really like Umiya. Except for the seared albacore, everything was fresh! Meats weren't as impressive (we got rib eye and pork belly), but it's always nice to have that option if you're craving a little bite of meat. There are tons of AYCE sushi options in Vegas, but I definitely feel like Umiya is one of the best, hands down. My only major comment would but that I feel like they should get at least ONE more server per lunch/dinner rush though. The servers are constantly running around and I feel bad for them!! They're working hard for sure.",

    "text": "I come here every time I visit and it's always consistent with their quality of fish and other dishes. I was in a party of 4 and had sat right away on a Friday afternoon.   Their AYCE menu has a really good selection of rolls, appetizers, and grilled food. They also have a good selection of alcohol from sake to soju, and to your hard liquors like Jameson and Makers Mark.    The service was fast and came to check on us every now and then to ask if everything was good. Would love to give my experience 5 stars but I felt a little unwelcomed when I was being served. I did not care so much for the underwhelming service because I was hungry. it was ending lunch when we had come in so I assumed they were all ending their shifts so they must have been tired. Not sure if their call button was working at the time or if was slow enough to be ignored by the staff, but they had no problem helping us when we flagged them down.   Other than that, it was great! Quick, pretty good quality, sushi & appetizers & other options for AYCE for a good price. Definitely recommend when in town",

The menu has a huge variety of sushi (maki, nigiri,and special rolls) as well as other japanese appetizers and entrees (udon, ramen, and meats). You order everything off of the menu and it's freshly made at the bar and brought out to you. The 2 hour time limit seems a little rushed, but we came at a late hour (around 11:00pm on a weekday) and the waiters were very attentive in taking orders and food came out almost instantly. There are a few items marked on the menu that you can only order one serving of, but everything else is fair game for as many orders as you want. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the size of the menu, I'd recommend focusing on these marked items first - I tried almost all of them and they were unusual and among the best stuff I ate all night.",

    "text": "Umiya sushi is a moderately sized restaurant with a dark and gloomy interior. There is a sushi menu for all you can eat and a regular menu. I will post photos for both menus later...   Outside, it is on a barren road. There is a parking lot and several other Japanese restaurants nearby. Parking should not be a problem. There are plenty of spaces to park.   Inside, it is dark. It feels like it is nighttime once you enter. There is a bar to the right and sushi station. The tables are wooden in the middle and have wooden benches. On the sides are small regular tables and chairs surrounded by willow, tree-like strands. To the left of the entrance is an Asahi alcoholic station. I'm not much into alcoholic drinks, but people would probably like it. There are restrooms in the back and no free wifi.    The service was pretty bad to be honest. The servers were bored and never smiled while serving me. But, the service came by at about the 5-10 minute mark.    The food is very good,  high quality and fresh. I felt it was one of the best I have ever eaten. We happened to order the all you can eat. I felt it was expensive but, you get what you pay for here. The all you can eat for adults at dinner time which is after 3pm-2am everyday costs us $25.95 a person. The lunch was cheaper at about $20.95, this option is only open from 11am-3pm. The rules are: no leftovers or you pay extra, you only get 90 minutes to eat and no sharing. I found this out the hard way at another sushi restaurant. This is standard for most, if not all sushi places.    The prices are high for majority of their items on the regular menu. At least for the good entree items, it ranges from $12 and up. Overall, my experience here was great. I felt that the service let me down and all you can eat prices were a little on the rough side, but felt it was worth the try.I",

For examples 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner compared to 21.95 and 26.95 at other places. Environment wise, I like spacing of the tables as well as the option of being in a bar. Food wise, they offer the usual like sushi rolls, nigiri sushi and appetizers. But I wanna talk about the stuff that makes them special. For example, they don't only offer 1 yakitori, they also offer other good stuff like the bacon wrapped scallop skewer. For entrees, they don't only offer simple teriyaki stuff, they also have grilled mackerel and octopus which was decent. Last but not least they have fresh oysters, not fried oysters like the other joints. Overall, their price was really good, the environment felt welcoming and their food selection is better than most AYCE Japanese places. There were a few bad things; like they don't have enough waiters and desserts is limited to 1.",

Where's other places.. (Oh jah) gives you two who slabs of chicken katsu. **Forgot to take a picture before eating, but remembered half way through**  I went with a 4 star because my family loved the sushi! They did the all you can eat, and they definitely got their money's worth. My boyfriend however ordered the Japanese steak as his first order and waited 30-45 min before they brought it out. And to his surprise.. it was a tiny little \"hamburger\" like patty. He was pretty disappointed, but stuck with the sushi after that.   Banana split is pretty bomb. I ordered it as the Ala carte because I didn't have the all you can eat. It was two hugggeeee scoops of vanilla ice cream, and it came with a huge banana cut in half, whip cream and a cherry",

First of all, the location of the restaurant is very convenient and it's in a good area, near the Palms Casino on Flamingo only a 10 minute drive from the Strip.  Secondly, the service is very fast and efficient.  The Manager is constantly walking around to make sure that all of your orders are completed.  He even followed up on a few orders that was missed and heard him in the radio to his staff to hurry up the order (in Korean, watching Korean soap operas are paying off).  Third of all, the restaurant is spacious and has feels even bigger with very high ceilings.  The tables are quite large, enough to hold all of the food you will soon order.   The sushi is not bad, nothing really stands out from other AYCE sushi places and are pretty much on par in terms of quality and selection.  Definitely one of the AYCE sushi places to try.",

This is important because many sushi restaurants think that clients are idiots and don't care about that. Quality of rice and preparation is important. And also to eat whole sushi that doesn't fall apart much convenient.  Second they have big menu and my favorite sushi with unagi which is rare.

One small round of rolls; a king of the ocean, half and Alaska and half a veggie roll. And one round of nigiri that included tuna, salmon, seared salmon, smoked salmon (which we never got), mackerel and ikura. We also ordered oysters.   The rice and all of the fish were just off. It wasn't fresh. The temperature was borderline warm. That was very apparent in the oysters and nigiri. The rice was very mealy and had way too much vinegar in it.  Service was decent. Nothing to write home about. We sat at the sushi bar as usual and just happened to have the pleasure of watching an employee wrap a bunch of tuna without any gloves-- grabbing pieces of Saran Wrap and touching fish over and over. Another thing that bothered me was watching the sushi chefs bring rolls in the back for deep frying. I caught a few glimpses here and there and it definitely made me uneasy and wasn't enticing me to order those any time soon.  Umiya, we had a nice run but we're breaking up for good. There's no way I can give you another go after what we saw and tasted today. Womp womp.",

They don't even include all the rolls on all you can eat so I don't understand why I would pay 30 dollars for some OKAY sushi. The service here is so horrible. I come here weekly with my friends after work and every time we're there they forget rolls or they give us such bad attitude... LISTEN LINDA I get your pregnant but I didn't make you get pregnant and work so don't be rude to me. And let's mention there NO SAFE closing procedures first of all. Why the fuck are you guys putting DIRTY trashcan stacked up right next to the sushi bar when you guys are still prepping food? I've never seen something like this and it's ridiculous. The only reason I could even think about coming here was bc the late night special was only 20 bucks but after not getting ALL my rolls I ordered and YES I ordered before 1:30 because I know exactly what I want already. Get new staff, get better sushi and come up with a better menu and maybe you'll see my service again..... as for my friends and I were not coming back and it's a shame when we would go there at least two times a week.

As my first time visiting the city of excess, I was super stoked to eat to excess from one of Vegas' many bountiful buffets. But what's this you say?! There's actually a restaurant that lets you eat as much sushi to heart's content at a capped cost? Don't mind if I do!  Not only was the service eager to please and friendly, but the options were as plentiful as the portions. I tried some grilled peppers, tempura jalapeno peppers with cream cheese and tuna, wonderful, spicy yellow tail roll, and melt-in-your mouth yellow tail sushi nigiri. The most unique element was that you had the option to roll your sushi in brown rice instead of white - not healthier but a whole new texture, too!",

They have rules about the \"all you can eat\" menu. Some are 1 order person, some are one piece, etc. we orders the tuna poke, excellent , fresh and succulent , nicely spiced. Followed by oysters - fresh and tasty. Then onto the hamachi- 2 stars, Saba -3 stars and unagi-4 stars. For hot plates, we had the grilled Mackerel -5 stars and chicken skewers- 3 stars. We also orders the baked mussels which was meh. We ended this meal with plum ice cream -3 stars and mango mochi- 4 stars. All this was $21. Spectacular! We also got some hot sake to compliment the meal.  The service was excellent. Once u order, they leave a call button on your table and the servers were very responsive.

BUT BIG mistake!!! the sushi chef comes over to our table and warns us FREAKIN WARNS US and really SCOLDS US that we should be ashamed because we left rice! I ONLY left rice in my soup because I like to eat rice in my soup. it's a Korean thing! and they're korean! The first round of sushi was great. small pieces and little rice. BUT the 2nd round. rice got bigger than the fish AND the slice of fish was thinner. then the 3rd round, Big balls of rice and super razor thin slices... no... SLIVERS Of fish. How do they expect us to eat that much rice towards the end of our meal!? Seriously do they not think!? Never will we return and I will warn everyone I care about to NEVERA Come here, unless they want to be harassed and SCOLDED for leaving rice. it wasn't even that frkn much. those a**hole staff for calling us out like that. OH! Did I mention that the sushi chef especially told us it's because we're KOREAN and he expected us to do that.",

This was the freshest and most delicious sushi ever, and for a ridiculously low price of $26.95 we ordered the all you can eat menu. Appetizers were amazing with a fresh tuna salad, delicious steak and seared tuna. The fresh made sushi rolls were among the best I have ever had, no crazy sauce just great flavor and so good. We ordered tuna hand rolls, ramen...you name it. We were stuffed and all agreed this was the absolute best meal we had in Vegas. Service was incredibly fast, even the hot tea and green tea ice cream were great. I could not recommend a sushi restaurant any more highly than Umiya. I cannot wait to go there again. A+++++",

They were short staffed, didn't check in with us very often, and from time to time they would forget a couple orders. Even though these acts are forgivable due to past experiences, I feel that if you set a specific standard through each and every visit, you should always follow through with that high standard. I will in the future give Umiya another shot, but hopefully my next experience will be better than my last.",

It's sometimes crowded which is a good thing because it means other people like it too. Most of the time it's not crowded which is awesome too because...NO WAIT WOOOO! The service is awesome, they're always on top of things and the guys behind the sushi bar are funny.

We went on a Wednesday nite and everyone knows that the WEEKENDS are the best times to eat fresh Sushi.  We sat right at the counter and I can spot fresh gleaming fish when I see it . After I saw a few orders of fresh fish go out and they looked delicious, I decided to give it a try.  I started with the halibut, next the tuna, then the salmon, then the albacore. I really was totally impressed and the place wasn't that busy.  Then I went for the kill, pork belly, rib-eye steak,  squid,baby octopus,fresh oysters. I downed a bottle of saki and some beer, took a little breather.  For my final finally I had bacon wrapped scallops,flamingo rolls. I had the lobster roll and it had nice chunks of lobster that you could really taste.  I wanted to try some of the nice desserts that I saw, but I was just to full, and I don't believe in wasting good food.  I am very picky about what I eat and I have to say everything was great. overall this is a great place and I hope they do well. I left a good tip also.  I will be back next week and so will my friends Anyone who complains about this place for the price and variety, are just some unhappy souls. I looked at some of the stupid remarks of others and for some reason they don't realize what their getting for $27.00 . On the strip I would have paid $150 or more for all this.  So for all the cheap complainers, don't expect Wagyu Filet and Australian Lobster when your paying McDonalds prices.  Some of these people think they are Anthony Bourdain. Learn to enjoy life , eat drink , be merry , leave a nice tip, and don't sweat the small stuff. Most small businesses really bust their but to survive. So be nice and be fair, before you go on a bashing mission.",

Just standing waiting for anyone to help us.   When we were finally seated at the bar, we sat and waited for anybody to take orders for us. I asked the sushi chef if we order from him and he rudely told me he'll ask for the server. The staff were very RUDE and cold. Every time we tried to order, the guy would slam his notepad and say what do you want. They were so disorganized that they came up to us 5 times with food that wasn't ours.   The nigiri was paper thin with a huge chunk of rice. The rice itself was so dry and tasted very off. The oysters were disgusting. I almost threw up trying to swallow it. With as much lemon and ponzu on the oysters, nothing can hide that foul dead ocean taste. The seafood ceviche was even weird tasting like it was old. There was random pieces of fish from idk what part of fish. The ribeye was JOKE! It was so dry and thin that it couldn't been ribeye. It had to be some cheap meat on sale at Smiths.  THE BEST PART. I ordered tuna roll and it was literally 5 percent fish and 95 percent rice. I couldn't help but laugh because I've never seen a roll like this in any sushi place in my life!!   I also tried their ramen which was INSTANT RAMEN. I wish it said that or else I would of never ordered it. It's okay though, I used the ramen to hide my pitty tuna rolls in.   I was so disappointed at this place that I didn't even brother with a second round of nigiri. Save your money and go else where NOW!",

The cucumber and seaweed salad were good.  The worst part of our experience was that our orders were messed up a couple of times and that it took over 20 minutes to receive several different orders. We noticed other tables seemingly receive food before us and were attended to more frequently.  I usually eat the nigiri and overall is was average and didn't seem that fresh.  The rice seemed to easily fall apart when dipping the sushi into the soy sauce.  The texture and overall taste of the rice didn't seem right.  We tried the chicken katsu, yakisoba and ramen and these were overall good.  The place was never over 1/2 full and with several people working there we expected the staff to be more attentive to us.",

    "text": "Recommended this wonderful AYCE sushi joint by a resident friend. It's located in a small strip mall, but don't let that deter you from the quality inside. This little place ranks up there with some of the best AYCE I have encountered anywhere...and the $26/p is ridiculously cheap for the quality.   The menu was very extensive, the quality was exceptional and the food came fast...like 3-minutes from ordering to your table fast! Plus their waiters were very attentive and would constantly check in on you if your plates were getting empty.   I don't give 5-Stars often, but this place deserves it! Check them out!",

    "text": "Best Sushi Place in town at the moment on 06/15/17.  This location has the fastest service with almost never a wait.  It has the freshest fish off the strip right now!  The open seating is great and I love the large wooden tables here.    The AYCE dinner menu is awesome and often includes salmon belly and other great bites.   The Garlic Ponzu sauce here is to die for and I use it on almost all my rolls.   The baked green muscles are great and all the fish comes out at the right temperature which is not always the case here in Las Vegas because it is a desert!    The fast service here and water refills really separate this place apart from the rest!  Keep up the good work!  Notes:  This location actually gives you a receipt with every item you ate even if it's AYCE.  I enjoy this because I can look back and see if it was worth the AYCE and I can see what we enjoy eating the most!  It's really amazing sushi.  The last time I was here I ate around 120$ if I was to eat a la cart!  * Update 01/15/18:  This location remains my favorite Las Vegas Sushi Restaurant!",

    "text": "I have already told every single soul I know about this place - I wouldn't say the fish was the freshest that I have ever had, or that the quality was too good to be True, BUT for the price of $26 pp, the food they delivered was definitely worth the price.  We were a party of 6, got to make reservation and was seated right when we got there.  Service was quite swift , we were very cooperative by writing down all we wanted in the first round, and the food came with no problem.  The second round took a bit more effort, we did the same and ordered with a piece of paper that we had written down but the food never came, and then with a bit of struggle, we got a little more than half of what we ordered. We were full by that time, so didn't even bother asking about it anyways.  Uni was good, amaebi was quite fresh, and best of all - they didn't make mega-sushi like a lot of the other sushi joints in US.  Most of the food was pretty good, the rice was decently made, not bad.   I think I will definitely come back again, and try the dishes that we ordered but never came..lol",

Soft shell crab roll was oily and shaggy, seafood dynamite scallop taste BAD, other sushi rolls we ordered wasn't up to standard all taste old, not fresh and also our rolls order keep taking forever to get to our table we keep on reminding the several different servers about our food order.   SIMPLY THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD DINING HERE AT UMIYA!!!  Came back the next few hours later around 7pm (on July 3 2017) talked to the manager he took me to the back and I explain everything and he simply said I will talk to the owner and send me off my way. He took down my phone number and name but the manager or the owner never called me back with the follow!!!   I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE EVER AGAIN THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD THIS IS SIMPLY RIDICILIOUS!!!",

They don't have as much as Korean food as tomo, and you have to get nigiri instead of sashimi. But the quality of the dishes (baby octopus, hot appetizers, the tuna and uni mentioned above) are definitely tops in this game.  One other really amazing thing is the speed - waiters are literally flying around and we got our food super fast.  They give you 90min instead of Jjanga's 60min so that's a win too!",

They have a LARGE selection of specialty rolls, appetizers, entrees, and dessert. There were at least 4 staff that came to us filling our drinks, taking our orders, bussing our table, and simply just checking on us. We sat at the sushi bar so even the sushi chefs were catering to us. I love that because in my opinion, the best dining experience doesnt only mean good food but more importantly getting superior customer service. Everything tasted great! My favorite were the fresh and fried oysters, soft shell crab, and baked lobster roll. The only thing I wished were part of the ayce is the hamachi kama. That would just make this place hands down the best AYCE sushi place! The music was a lil' loud but it was just part of the fun vibe this place has to offer. I would definitely come back here! Keep up the great service and amazing food!",

    "text": "We just had the worst experience of AYCE sushi ever. We were there for lunch today.  We planned to have sushi lunch for me and one of our group's birthday. We had been picking a sushi place for the whole week. One of my friends picked this place ad I was here last month for dinner. I told my friends I liked the interior this place. So we ended up here.  There were only 3 tables were seated when we got there. Our table had 6 asian girls with one baby. We got water all set up. Oh good. A server came right when everyone got there \" are you ready to order?\" well we hadn't even looked at the menu yet. We were discussing about paying dinner price to get sweet shrimp and sea urchin. then we ordered salmon nigari to start and the question we got was \"so are you gonna pay lunch or dinner?\" I replied \"start with salmon nigari. it is in both lunch and dinner. and we will decide in a couple minutes\" I got a little annoyed. We decided to just have lunch because some of us don't eat sweet shrimp and sea urchin.  Once we started ordering, one of the servers said \"make sure you guys read all the rules\" the rules are pretty much the same as the other AYCE sushi restaurant. No rice left, no sharing with non-AYCE, and so on. We all got annoyed. I understand the waitress was doing her job by informing us. but we all know the rules.  Food is good. We got our orders pretty fast. There were some confusion but we ignored it. There were two waitresses. on we got too many orders of grilled mackerels, and i told them \"don't worry about it. I will eat them.\"   Here come the worst parts. They got more customers coming. There were only two waitresses. Our water and hot tea was empty. We had to call them and asked for refills. One time my friend pulled out her dr.peppers bottle to drink, the server came right at her \"no outside food or drink in here\" or now they were more observant with outside drink than our glasses of water that were empty. awesome job ladies! Morever, in the middle of the meal, the server came and told us \"you have to finish all the rice\" We know. and we were still working on our food. We were eating and having a great conversation. Our meal started to be ruined by. Another server came and picked the spoon in my miso soup bowl and said \"you have to finish rice in the soup too\" oh this is so RUDE. You can talk to me but you don't touch my spoon in my food that is right in front of me! I said \"I eat my soup with rice\" she said \"oh ok because someone tries to hide rice in soup\" I got so pissed. They spoke to us with attitude. honey, let me tell you here. If we cheat about rice, we make sure you can't catch me hiding all the rice somewhere.  Our group decided to not tip them because this was so bad of dinning experience, but the server dropped the check and said gratuity had been added. We still gotta pay them without gratuity anyway.  Lucky for the server that I saw a gentleman walking in and out the restaurant for a while. I decided to call him and asked \"are you a manager?\" he said \"I am the owner\" Bingo! We told him the food was great but the service was really bad. He said \"talk to me, tell me everything\" We told him everything. He said \"they are trying to protect me\" but they didn't try to have a good service to protect you from the bad review. We asked if he could take the gratuity out because there is no law to add gratuity in vegas anymore. he said it was in the system, then he handed us $20 to be a part of the gratuity we had to pay. The owner is really nice guy. One of our friends told him to the point \"we are not cheap. When we tip, we tip a lot. We are in service industrial too. We know what is good what is bad service.\" We gave him his $20 back. Then he gave us a couple 20% discount cards and told us to come back. We felt like we could let this go and we wouldn't review anything, but we won't come back.   Unfortunately, the server wouldn't let us go. We put all the money in. Of course we are pain in the ass when someone is a B to us. We paid the check with all $1 bills. she said \"Oh my god\" why? it is the money too!!!! we tipped you! because your employer is nice to us and he protects his employees! I told her \"we already talked to the owner\"   ****GUESS WHAT SHE TOLD US? SHE SAID \"it's ok. He is not the owner\"****  They need to fire this girl. I feel bad for the owner or whoever he is. He could be a partner/a manager but he is her employer. He tried to protect her and took the money out of his pocket to help us pay for gratuity, but obviously she didn't protect him.  NOT done yet, we all were still sitting and eating after we gave her money. Only one of us had to stand up to hold her baby because she started crying. That server said to me \"everyone has to finish the rice\" more like yelled at me. I couldn't stand this anymore so I yelled back \"I AM STILL WORKING ON IT!\" god damn it! I didn't wanna finish my mackerel and rice anymore. We just walked out right after. 2 bites of rice left they can finish it.",

Getting there from the strip: If you don't want to pay for a tax, get on the Gold Coast shuttle from Bally's to Gold Coast. The restaurant is  a 1/3 mile walk down W Flamingo.",

You don't find these great sauces at a lot of other places! Nigiri is on the smaller side but we decided that might be a good thing so you can try more stuff and eat less rice!

One female staff with black hair and chubby cheeks was extremely rude and neglected every request that was made. Even after the total negative vibe from chubby, she had the nerve to ask us to tip her even though it's an option. An older woman who seemed to be the manager was very friendly but all in all, I'll never come back.",

At the end, they included the tip for our 6 meals. I was alright with the included tip, but usually included tips for casual dining places like this establishment only charge like 12%. 18% included tip for fine dining. But this place had an included tip of 20% for 6 people! I believe they counted the baby. And they didn't specify it anywhere, or not anywhere convenient.

    "text": "It is our first time visiting this AYCE Sushi restaurant on a friend's recommendation and based on service alone, I would have rated 1-star but gave it 2-stars for the average sushi.  The sushi nigiri is decent with good ratio between rice and fish (the fish were a tad dry, but I'll stop nitpicking). Miso soup is something I usually order FIRST from sushi restos but would totally avoid it here -- instant miso packets bought from a supermarket tastes way better! And the sad part is it's the first thing we ordered but had to keep asking for its whereabouts a few times before it was delivered. We also tried their tuna poke and fresh oysters which were excellent but then let down by the heavily breaded soft shell crab and sour-tasting calamari. And don't get me started on how awful the spicy tuna roll is, it's a simple dish that should be the least hardest to screw up on.  The service we received was sub par to put it kindly. Maybe we arrived after lunch rush hour and everyone is dead tired but I'm making excuses to understand why the wait staff sucked. Our inattentive waitresses (yes that's plural) often neglected us and kept \"forgetting\" simple requests like napkins, soy sauce, wasabi and then (almost) tossing in orders on our table as they flew by.  On a larger scale, it became increasingly annoying when we kept getting wrong orders and repeatedly had to ask for and follow up our sushi orders which we eventually gave up on and decided to move on and just pay our bill. In Las Vegas where there's lots of choices, including good AYCE sushi joints, Umiya will not be one of them.  I can overlook mediocre food, even bad food, but crappy service is unforgivable especially if the price point is higher than better places. At least I can tell my friend we tried the place and it was 'okay' at best.",

I asked for a cup of water 3 times to 3 different people before asking for the manager. He simply said sorry and filled it.but still no further service. after receiving my check they spotted our table for 30 minutes again while I waited for water, and the would walk by and eye the check.but never fill the empty cups sitting in front of it.   food is a definite 5/5 service was a 1/5  paid 75 dollars for 3 people and received fast food style service .",

Mind you the service was really bad. But besides the point, one by one we ALL got food poisoning from this place. If we all got food poisoning, it gives you an idea of just how hazardous this food was. We went Sunday 07/29 at 4 pm and that same night my sister got diarrhea around 11pm and I woke up at 6 am running to the bathroom to vomit. Next thing you know I hear from everyone else in our group that they had vigorous food poisoning and one of us even went to the hospital (Doctor said it was food poisoning from the sushi.) I call 4 times before getting ahold of the manager through out the day and finally get ahold of him letting him know what happened and he said there's nothing he can do without all 5 of us going in person with doctor's notes and MAYBE he could process a refund. (As if hospital care is cheap and all this just for a $27 refund.) That if we had claimed the food poisoning RIGHT after the meal he could've given us a refund but since it wasn't exactly after the meal he has to \"go through insurance to process a refund but only with paperwork stating the exact bacteria that came the exact fish they serve to conclude it was indeed their food\" ALL OF THIS FOR A REFUND. Which in my opinion is the LEAST they could do for what we went through. (Btw Who gets sick RIGHT after you're done eating to begin with!?!) I was obviously pissed and told him well if you need us to all go through so much JUST for a refund then why don't your customers receive their own paperwork stating that your fish has parasitic microbes before feeding us and getting us sick in the first place? And this guy really said \"because it's such a high volume of people, we cannot let everyone know of the circumstances we are under at all moments.\" Idk what he meant with that but sounds to me like he was admitting to knowing the food really is a problem. Well, to conclude we got nowhere but so far, two dreadful days of vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, dizziness, and muscle/bone pain. Horrifying.   Beware.. you are warned.",

The servers were very friendly and helpful though, and we really appreciated the staff. The environment was good as well, but I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone as a \"must eat\" location.",

    "text": "The all you can eat is one of the best deals in Vegas.  At 26.95 for dinner it was one of the best choices we made.   There's no limit to what you can order at one time, but several highest quality things are indeed limited to one per paying customer.  We had about twenty different dishes and all were good.    The quality of the food was spectacular for the price point.  Sushi was well done.  We wish we had a strategy going into it as we talked and ate then talked some more and missed out as the 1 1/2 hour time limit slipped by.  We kicked ourselves afterwards for not ordering more nigiri as we easily could have inhaled those morsels.    Located a few miles off the strip it did not disappoint.    Our strategy next time: 1. Look carefully at the specials and ask what the portion size is. (Example: the salmon kama was HUGE, whereas the yuzu hamachi could be thrown into your mouth with one-bite ease)  2. Anything limited, like the toro, max it out for the total of paying people.  Do the same for the fresh oysters and a few others.   3. While it's nice to have garnish dishes like agedashi tofu or edamame, we came here to eat, so don't bother unless you are a nibbler and want variety.   Caveat: they do charge for waste so don't go over board.    Service was excellent.  They work in tandem between bussing, table drops, and ordering.  Our guy was like the newest Spider-Man, \"Tom Holland\" was attentive, gave great recommendations and did everything asked of from a server.",

My party and I ordered around 12:45pm ((and keep in mind that this is not the usual busy hours)), they brought out all the appetizers after 40+ minutes and we just wondered why our nigiri and rolls didn't come out shortly after. Come to find out that our server didn't put in our order, which she didn't apologize or even try to compensate for our forgotten order that we had to wait 40 minutes for. Instead another server decided to charge us for not eating a small portion of rice.  On top of that, usually when ordering nigiri the rice is half the size of the fish but it seems that they're choosing to up the size of the rice so that you get full faster :(  You definitely won't catch me eating AYCE sushi anymore, Island Sushi is the move!",

It will overfill your stomachs with the good good :)  PRICE: - $25.95 for dinner AYCE - Half price for children up to 7 yo  FOOD: - They have pretty much every type of fish available including uni & fresh oysters. But for items like these there is a limit to your order (ex.1 order of uni per person) - Plenty of appetizers available including miso soup, ceviche, baked mussels, seaweed salad, gyoza, spicy tuna on crispy rice & soft shell crab - Full 2 pages of rolls if you're not much of a sushi person - Wrap up your raw meal with some meat (teriyaki, rib-eye) and noodles (udon, ramen)  - And don't forget... ICE CREAM! From tempura ice cream to mochi ice cream (1 per person) like o m g pls don't miss out on this!  - Some of my favorites were fresh oysters, soft shell crab, garlic tuna, uni, eel, mackerel, and mochi ice cream!  SERVICE/ETC: - I wouldn't say the staff is welcoming/nice, but they're quick and do what needs to be done. - No limit on \"rounds\" just keep ordering!  - Love the ambience inside: open & modern space with slightly dim lights. And there's a full bar!  As you already know, AYCE doesn't offer the best quality of food. But for such cheap price, food here is not bad AT ALL! I was surprised at how fresh some of the fish were. Definitely coming back on my next visit!",

I feel that more often than not, I feel unsatisfied after ordering roll than I do at other places. The service is great though and they are always quick and respectful. I like the ahi tuna selections and the dynamite is my favorite appetizer.",

The portions are good sized.  We ordered lots of different types of food, shrimp tempura, grilled squid, sushi rolls, hand rolls, nigiri & oysters.   The Snow White roll,  soft shell crab with ono was delish.   Yellowtail hand rolls were amazing with nigiri sized fish with minimal rice.   It was $22.95 for lunch & $26.95 for dinner.   You only get a few extra items for the dinner menu such as 1 order of amaebi, 1 order of uni & a few other things I forgot.   The service was great as there werent too many people when we were there.   Music included today's pop along with the videos.   Check in offer: free soda!  We'll be back for sure!",

One waitress barely speak English, and the whole staff spoke in Korean at the bar where I was sitting during my whole visit made me kinda uncomfortable.   The bright side is one waiter was really attentive so I tipped him but not sure that he would get the tip.",

The location is a walking distance away from The Palms so if you have a movie date or have friends in town you got some place to go before/after.  I would have given them 5 stars, but the only thing that brought it down was the ice cream~ they have them already pre-scooped and frozen into the bowl so it was a bit of a struggle to scoop out (my daughter is still young, she couldn't dig her spoon in without the bowl flying). Adults will be able to serve themselves but it's still stiff. Put the bowl upside down and gravity will be on its side.   So... Get the mochi!   Other than that! I will definitely come back again!   **Updated** I came back here and their ice cream is way fresher now! Thank you Umiya!!",

I was disappointed with the rice to fish ratio for the nigiri. Too much rice! Also the rice was hard and cold! The different pieces of fish itself were perfect, soft, room temp and delicious.  Some packed with explosions of flavors, but that rice killed it for me and my bf.  The baked mussels were yummy. Lots of mayo, the way I like it. You can still taste the mussels too. Some places make it so that the sauce drowns out the flavor.  Their other dishes that aren't sushi related were amazing though. That rib eye steak, the soft shell crab, chicken katsu and tonkotsu ramen were delicious. Service was really good and overall, my bf and I had our fill and left satisfied.",

Once we got seated, my boyfriend and I checked in on Yelp with the waitress to get our free sodas but our 2 other friends were still logging into their accounts.   They apparently switched waitresses on our table and another girl came; with whom my other 2 friends showed their Yelp checkin. My boyfriend and I told our new waitress that we had already checked in with a different waitress. No big deal.   However, halfway through our meal, our waitress came back and gave us problems for not checking in with her on Yelp and asked who we had checked in with and whatnot.   ...it's a free soda...it's not a big deal...relax lady.   Anyways, staff was overall a little rude and unhappy the whole time. The food was okay but the service could definitely be better.",

The sashimi is probably about half of the thickness of what it should be, they are so thin that they seem to be transparent. The Hamachi lover roll is super tiny.

    "text": "Let me start off by my experience was pleasant until the end.  Service and employees where attentive and prompt. Food was not the greatest but definitely delicious (4 stars when it comes to food)  My experience changed when I was treating my guest to dinner. 199 to be exact.  I left my card with the server and waited to receive my receipt. This is when one of the employees comes back to the table and ask \"who does this card belong to\" capturing everyone's attention. That's when the employee said loudly \"your card is declined.\" I was speechless and felt uneasy because of how it made me look really bad. It seemed like the employee was happy to say it was declined.   I called my bank and they said they did not receive a decline and to have them try again. So I went up to clear up the situation and fix what happened. I saw with my eyes the card declined and had to use another card.   Anyway, I asked for a manager which seemed like a young kid compared to the gentlemen that embarrassed me. When I explained what happened he told me in a calm not really caring voice sorry. He said he will talk to the employee. I felt like no justice was being served so I mentioned I will just leave a Yelp review about my experience. He just smiled and continued with business.  So I went back to my table to ease my guest and let them know the bill was paid. As we were leaving the young manager tried to apologize and made up an excuse to say his English was \"bad\" and that he will have a discussion with the staff. The employee even used broken English to say sorry.... here the crazy part. The same employee that was using broken English was pronouncing \"who does this card belong to\" and the word \"decline\" in perfect English. Maybe dropping the YELP hint changed his heart to make discipline sound more serious. It was too late after giving you the first opportunity to fix it.   I would have given this establishment a 5 start rating until what happened at the end.   All my friends agreed that this place was great until the employee changed the whole mood.   I'm definitely not coming back to this establishment.",

Rooks, nigiri, ramen, hot and cold appetizers and some entrees and dessert! But of course I didn't have any room for desserts....  This place is clean, hip and the staff is super friendly! Unfortunately at AYCE places, service is generally not that great.... but this place isn't one of those places. Our waitress was super cute and friendly and pretty much knew what we wanted lol. Then there was a male waiter that was almost too much. He was funny and was having a blast at his job which is alway awesome to see!  They have certain items that are only available with the dinner AYCE so we just decided to get that. I mean $5 more to get uni, salmon belly, tsubugai and much much more? Why wouldn't you!? The only sad part was that the amaebi didn't come with the fried head... but I can over look that the quality and variety that umiya had to offer!",

Thank goodness because the wait was about 40 mins. Well worth it. Talk about hard to find good AYCE sushi places. None exist in Seattle. Sorry Todai but you weren't that good even when you were open.

    "text": "4.5-star?  Either I went on the wrong night or Umiya Sushi isn't as good as it's advertised on here.  I ordered an assortment of sushi and non-sushi items and I can't say any one of them stood out.  Everything did have a common theme and it's that NOTHING was fresh.  The white tuna and the sweet shrimp had this fishy (old) odor emanating from them and the other fish were sticky, kind of like when you sweat and it dries on your skin.  Overall, not worth the price or the quality.  I understand that Las Vegas isn't exactly near the ocean so the fish is probably sent in frozen but everything just tasted like it was on the verge of going rotten.  The staff kept messing up our order and the table next to us had to tell the waiter/waitress several times that they didn't order something that they brought over.  Not to mention, the staff were a bit rude in trying to rush us out after less than 1 hour into our meal just because people were waiting and we weren't even close to reaching their self imposed 2 hour limit.  When they start suggesting that you order ice cream, that their hint for you to GTFO.   Needless to say, I'm definitely not coming back.",

    "text": "(Read all the way to the end! Saved the best for last!)  We visited Umiya for a late lunch AYCE, Tues. around 2:30 and there was only one other group seated, so virtually we had the whole huge open place to ourselves. (Liked that!) Once seated, it took her about ten minutes to come by and take our first order. I'll say only one thing about the service and that it was chilly but businesslike: take order, bring order, clear plates, take order, bring order -no eye contact, no smile, and no re-filling of beverages unless we requested. It is what it is. I can usually warm up any chilly server, but not this one! Might try sitting at the bar next time so as to not be 100% reliant on the server.   Nonetheless, the food was pretty spectacular. If you're familiar with the AYCE sushi scene in Vegas, you get a little hard to impress after a short time. This was a happy surprise and I'm delighted to be impressed after so long...   The menu was indeed very extensive. I'm sure you could visit many multiple times and never duplicate, yet leave full and happily satisfied. Since it was our trial run, I took some tips from previous yelpers...  1. Screaming O salad: did not like this - it was like a mayonaise soup. Steer clear if you don't like a heavy-handed dose of the stuff. 90% mayo, coating of thick mayo on top, three thin slices of ahi underneath, and some lettuce swimming in the watery mayo soup at the bottom of the bowl. Now we know... 2. The snow white roll and orange blossom roll were FRIKKIN AMAZING. Snow white roll -each individual piece of the roll is ever so slightly grilled, so it has a whisp of a smokey flavor. My little tastebuds were freaking out. Insanely good, and so different! Orange blossom roll was also enjoyably different. 3. Red Rock roll - kind of forgettable, but I do remember thinking, \"ugh, more mayonaise?\" 4. Rib eye steak - was just ok.  5. Now, there's one thing on the menu we discovered this day I would place in the \"EXQUISITE\" category. The bacon wrapped scallop skewer. O. M. G. These tiny little gems come two (ONLY TWO?) to a skewer. Just trust me -you're going to want a few of these. I popped the first one in my mouth, and just had to sit there for a moment-what was this? Sweet, salty, chewy, fluffy... what? I just stared at my pal across the table. No words. Eyeballs scanned the restaurant for next closest waitress/server. \"Yes, another one of these, please?\" I forced my now-stuffed table-mate to try one because they are that good. Crack. Bacon-wrapped-scallop CRACK.  6. Mango mochi for dessert. Couldn't hold a candle to the sweet candied bacon wrapped goodness I just described.  Few little notes: - I could imagine a full house, with such a big open space and all hard surfaces would get pretty obnoxiously loud. Prepare, and time your dining session if that would bother you.   -They charge $2 for green tea. This really chapped the hide of my dining partner. He was personally affronted -like they were charging for breathing air. Again, so now you know.  - Service with a little charm doesn't cost anything, but apparently its not a priority here. Ok, got it. (The food outshines this aspect of Umiya.)  Overall: excellent and delightfully impressed, will be back, again at an \"off\" hour.  (Let me know if you like those bacon-crack-skewers, too!)",

The rolls seem pricey, but they are quite big with lots of fish \"stuffing.\" My favorite roll and I recommend this to anyone who loves avocado, spicy tuna or will try just about anything, has got to be the AVOCADO TRAIN. It isn't on the AYCE menu so I'm always torn between my options, either I go with the Roll and salad option or if I want to fish out and do the AYCE. My fave salad is the Spicy Tuna Salad, They add chunks of fresh tuna on a bed of greens with a tangy dressing, quite satisfying and not too heavy. All in all I highly recommend this place. It is small, quite, the staff are friendly and if you get bored with your companionship they have music videos playing on a big screen ;)",

Usually when i go to ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI, i kinda give up on quality of food. However with Alex, you still and always  meet the perfection!  Last night I was at Umiya with my friends and we were doing al la carte ( i usually do all u can eat) since we were not that starving. As soon as i sat at the bar, i ordered an order of uni sushi which is $8.50. Seconds later Alex came up and gave me an apology saying they actually do have uni today but it's not worth the money since it's not that fresh. Then he recommended salmon sushi which was only $5. I was so impressed!! He could have served the uni and took it off from the bill only if and after customer complains about it! But he is always honest with the food he serves.  Try their AYCE SUSHI! It's cheap and you still get variety Japanese food! I will absolutely go back to this place!",

The staffs were friendly and nice.  Overall this place was not bad.  All you can eat Lunch price $21 & Dinner $26 (around that price).",

    "text": "I can understand a lot of the reviews here. As far as my experience is concerned, I think 3 stars is fair. But, I'm leaning more towards 2.5 stars.  This place used to be the old sushi Kaizen. Never been to that one so I would have nothing to compare it too.  Came here with a pretty large group, and suffice to say, the service was excellent. The server did a great job taking the orders and made sure that each person got the correct dish, even while she was taking care of other tables as well. I also liked how we were able to order from the runners and bussers when she was busy.  Food wise, everything was mediocre to OK. One thing I had to mention was that the rice wasn't really good, it tasted like it had been refrigerated or undercooked. It was weird. The fish quality tasted average at best. As many of people have mentioned, they make the rolls and nigiri pretty fast here, but presentation isn't really their strong suit. And, they are pretty heavy handed with the sauces. I did like the chicken katsu roll, something that I have never had before. But, don't be fooled by the miso or tonkatsu ramen that is on the menu. It isn't late night Goyemon's. I ordered the miso ramen and it was their regular miso soup with instant ramen noodles LOL.  I definitely like trying new AYCE sushi spots. But at this place, I would have to probably have to put it in my mid to lower range spots.",

    "text": "First of all this place has great food and quality. My family enjoyed their food a lot. But,   They have horrible service. When we came around 6:30, they told me that it was going to take an hour and 40 minutes. But when my mom asked again around 6:50, they told us that it was only going to take 20-30 minutes. It was dinner time and we were all hungry. My mom got up to just look at the waiting list to see when our turn was and the waitress who was in front of my mom gave my mom an unpleasant look and started talking to the waiter next to her saying \"That lady won't just sit down and she keeps wandering in front of us\" like my mom was some annoying person who's just randomly annoying her. First of all, my mother is not just \"that lady\". She is your customer and despite the fact that we are in a restaurant, isn't it just straight up rude giving someone who you don't know at all a nasty look and talking about them? I was just so mad and shocked about how they treated my mother.   It was just my mom, my brother, and I who went to eat. As I was eating, I can see and hear with my two eyes and ears that the servers were asking around \"How was the food?\" or \"How is it going so far?\",yet all we got was \"Are you guys done eating?\" like they wanted to kick us out and bring in new customers. I know. Dinner time is very busy and they had a lot in their minds but they were treating us like we weren't going to pay and just take off or like we've been staying there for hours which none of it is True. Those services just started to make me think \"Is it because they see my mother as a single mom or something?\" or because it's just two weak women and some 7 years old kid.   Eating dinner outside with your family means having a meaningful time outside with your family by spending money. I am not sure what my mom did to deserve this kind of service but it was terrible and I was just so furious.",

Atmosphere: Big screen TVs, good music, upscale (not typical home in the wall place...very nice \"nightlife\" decor).   The comments about attentive, awesome service....CORRECT  Food/Fish/Portions Quality: Outstanding (Try the Lobster Roll, Las Vegas, Baked Mussels, Octopus, Salmon & if course...the Tuna) BTW...The chef dropped me a few pieces of Toro just to show how legit everything really is.    Poke is BANGIN & Seaweed Salad is fresh.    Sake & Beer: About 10-12 solid brands (sake) & all Asia beers.   I humbly consider myself a sushi expert with 400-500 sittings globally (yeah..avg 2x month x 20 years), as well as the son of a famous chef....(growing up in a kitchen has its benefits...later in life)   If you've read this much....stop & start driving to Umiya.  You'll be writing a review after you recover from the awesome meal your about to experience.    Cheers!",

We asked to be seated at the bar and it sucked because you weren't even allowed to order sushi from the chefs. Completely defeats the whole purpose and the bar is so high you can't even see how they make your food. Sushi was good but not great. I mean honestly nothing was great here. Then to put the cherry on top, my boyfriend order ramen before we closed out and it never came. We asked for it twice and nothing. Talk about waiting for over 20 minutes. We paid and left.

I've done a couple of all you can eat places in Vegas but they're all relatively the same. This was awesome because if was purely sushi and fish. We checked in through yelp and got a free beverage (non alcoholic)! The garlic tuna nigiri was tasty. We also had the orange blossom, salmon killer and cinch lobster roll. Sooooo good. We also had the spicy seafood salad to start. Again, delicious. It also comes with dessert. I had the tempura green tea ice cream. Definitely going to come back next time I'm in LV.",

Nigiri- maguro, hamachi, ono were all cut thinly and uneven, as if cut with an old knife. The tako was clearly over boiled and fishy which suggests it was cooked, frozen, then thawed again. All skewers were overly sauced taking out any flavor of being grilled. Miso soup was warm by the time we got it and lacked any seaweed or tofu. We did order one maki, a cucumber wrap instead of nori. That roll actually turned out to be quite refreshing and fun.  The wait staff seemed like they wanted us out quickly as they insisted on picking up the bill 3 times prior to us finishing our rock hard mochi ice cream. Pretty persistent on us leaving considering there was only 3 tables dining at 930pm on a Sunday night.  I don't know if I'd come back here. Though I'm not a fan of most AYCE sushi joints, I'd suggest Oyshi over here any day.",

    "text": "So if you read my previous review of Goyemon, this is where we came in place of the crowded. It was my first time and my sister thought I'd the place better. She was right as usual. Umiya was located in a small Japanese plaza right next to a starbucks. As soon as I walked in, the cool ambience and decor already began to soothe my hangry (hungry  angry) mood. Our server Jay was polite and got us our drinks quickly. He took our orders promptly and our first dish came out in less than 10mins! Every dish we tried was very good. Although, we didn't order many rolls because we thought it would fill us quickly, between the three of us, we ordered a lot of food. I felt like I was at an expensive course menu restaurant. I ended up having 5 courses in total with a tempura ice cream dessert. Jay probably refilled my diet coke 10 times which I appreciated as it was a seperate cost (even though with a check-in on yelp you get a free soda!). All in all, this is the evolution of Las Vegas buffets. All you can eat Japanese buffets have been popping up and all I could think was..how could the owner afford to keep this place? The quality of the food was outstanding, everything came out cooked-to-order, and service was 5 stars. The establishment was clean, the ambience would be great for a date, and also suitable for business meetings or hangover cures in the low light tents they have set up. Excellent Gem of a restaurant. I really don't understand why this joint wasn't busy while Goyemon was packed. Umiya is a few minutes from the strip and an absolute must eat in Las Vegas!",

This time around they insisted i try Umiya and compare it. Was not disappointed! The calamari tempura roll was my favorite. We tried a lot of the sushi on the menu as we were a big party, and needless to say we left pretty satisfied. I'm not saying Umiya is better than Goyemon, i think they are both great. It's just good to be able to try a new place in vegas that serves high quality sushi. Will be back!",

When we were done the server came over & told us if we didn't finish those last bites of our food they would have to charge extra to the whole table. Really? What if we didn't like the food? You would still make us eat it? Then the server didn't know how to ring up the bill & tried charging us extra anyway. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! It's like a prison camp where they are constantly watching us eat and checking our plates as they take each one away! Not a good way to keep customers coming back.

My daughter had a Philadelphia roll and a fried shrimp appetizer. They were both very good, however the salad dressing on both salads was not very palatable.  The service was good, they offer specials during the day ends late night. We went in on a Sunday night that turned into a Monday morning at midnight and they were unwilling to honor their Monday through Thursday, bonus. This was due fact( as they said it) it's still Sunday to us. Ok but to the rest of the world it's now Monday.  Anyways the service, ambiance and entree items made up for the music and awful salad dressing. 50/50 on return since it's far from us.",

The staff is very friendly and can accommodate small parties to very large parties--we have dined with both types and they service stays consistent. The rolls are very well-made and have a good ratio between rice and fish. The appetizers are also really good and are included in the all you can eat. They offer a big array of sides and apps that you can order from if one isn't up to sushi. The uni is also always fresh which is hard to find in a AYCE place.

    "text": "We landed in Vegas Saturday afternoon and had some time to kill before checking in to our house for a party. We wanted to stay off the strip and Umiya checked all the boxes we were searching for (off the strip, good reviews, sit down restaurant style, full bar) ... we hoped in our Uber and headed over.  Upon arriving, umiya is in a strip mall which was a bit disappointing for me initially, but I suppose most places in Vegas are strip malls. I'm from San Francisco where we don't have many at all. Once inside we were pleasantly surprised with the open, chill, modern, laid back decor. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and sat within minutes.  We ordered a couple appetizers and 3 rolls.  The egg rolls were just kinda gross, which I don't usually say about food. They tasted more like mashed potatoes than egg rolls, just mushy and flavorless, and a texture that no egg roll should have. I had a salmon roll (I forgot the name) it had crab inside and salmon / avocado on top. The crab was imitation, which wasn't labeled on the menu, or I would have asked for real crab, overall it was tasty but the sweet sauce they put on the plate, and then put the roll on was not good. It also came with tobiko which was not listed on the menu, or I would have asked for no tobiko. My guy enjoyed everything he had except the egg rolls & miso.   We still had an hour to kill when we finished eating and felt very rushed by the staff. We asked if it was fine to just order some drinks and chill, it was Saturday afternoon and there were still a ton of empty tables. They were fine with that, but the \"attentive\" service seemed a bit like they wanted us to just finish and leave, so we did.. after being asked several times if we wanted anything else, and let them know we'd catch their attention when ready for another drink.   Overall  Ambiance- surprisingly very nice. Bathrooms are a bit dingy, but not bad!  Service- friendly, fast, attentive   Food- great salmon & tuna, bad egg rolls & miso",

From speciality rolls to regular nigiri and temaki, for an AYCE place they did it well and right! The sushi tasted amazing and all plates were cleared at my table somehow!!  Being mixed Japanese the quality was good but the rice to fish ratio on a few rolls weren't the best for some of the specialty and cut rolls. But for an AYCE sushi place you aren't going for perfection of the roll, but just the food itself. As I said before, the taste was amazing!  What I love most about Umiya was that they had such an amazing menu apart from the impressive sushi menu. From salads, to oysters, to fried appetizers, to soups, to even things such as ramen and udon!  If you're in the mood for a lot of food and for an understandable price in Vegas, go to Umiya!",

All of their sushi that i have gotten has been fresh and super tasty. The only reason i had to give it 4 stars was because the last couple times we've been there, we've had the same server and she is extremely rude. She kept rushing us and cutting off our orders.

Lunch price was $20.95, which is still a good deal since I usually just order nigiri and apps and skip out on the rolls.  I ordered unagi, seared salmon, yuzu yellowtail, salmon belly nigiri and my favorites were the unagi and salmon belly.  Make sure to check the specials board - that's usually where the good stuff is listed. I was a little baffled my the seared salmon - it was only seared on the edges and not the top like most places.  It seemed like just regular salmon because of the minimal sear.  I did like that the pieces of fish were big compared to the amount of rice.  I ordered the bacon/scallop skewer - this was also sad because it's like tiny bay scallops wrapped in bacon.  The whole thing was probably the size of my finger tip.  The \"sausage\" was literally sausage, like polish or kieblasa....=(  I was thinking kurobuta sausage for some reason, so definitely skip this, not worth your time.  The breaded shrimp was good - think shrimp ball but fried but of course limited to one order.  Overall, not bad, but also not the best AYCE sushi place in town.  Super busy, I went at 2pm on a Sunday and the place was packed with people waiting.  Korean owned establishment.",

We sat at the bar and boy it had space compared to the usual bar tables where everybody touched elbows. I felt closer to the sushi making experience and had room for all my orders. It was not overcrowded at all here and easy to get around.  The vibe was great, good lighting and the music wasn't too loud and overbearing. My wife and I had a great time.   Service was super fast and We got our orders right on time ! Excellent service from the staff I give this place  Two thumbs up",

We sampled the egg rolls, edamame, tempura shrimp/calamari/veggies, chicken satay, a fried softshell crab, and a shit load of rolls!!!  I love that they allow half orders (4 pieces) so that we could sample different ones!!  The attached photo doesn't even include all the food we ate!!  It was all sooo good and the service was great!!  Only issues is that 90% of seating is hard benches with no back, which is awful on my back.

    "text": "Not my favorite spot in town for AYCE Sushi...but the one I frequent the most due to the combination of service, quality, and AVAILABILITY! Umiya has been consistent across several visits the last couple years, so when the topic of AYCE Sushi comes up these days, it tends to be our go-to option. My love and I are fans of nigiri, while our girls also like to mix it up with rolls. Umiya serves a good enough quality of fish with their nigiri that the adults are content, while the huge selection of rolls means everyone is pleased. And while sushi is our mainstay, we will venture into other types of food. There are certainly enough options that a non-sushi eater **pausing to sigh and shed a tear at the sad plight that some endure** could easily fill up on noodles, skewers, tempura, katsu, etc. without straining for options.  You don't tend to go to AYCE Sushi for the ambiance and Umiya doesn't really buck the trend. It's not that Umiya is bad by any means...mostly a large open dining room full of several long tables with bench seating...and as such things can get loud during their dinner rush. That being said, the tables are large enough that you have your own space.   I love that you can call ahead for reservations. Umiya goes on a wait wist during peak dinning options, but when we've made reservations...or even just called ahead 30-45 mins before we arrived, a table has been ready for us. This could just be our luck, but after more than a handful of visits here the last couple of years, I'd like to believe that it's the norm.  As a nigiri eater, the most import thing I can leave you with is a note on the specials board. There are a couple of wax marker boards hanging in the dinning room, and another at the sushi bar itself, that list some special that are in that day. These typically include some premium items that have a limit on how many you can order, and my favorite items of the night are typically listed here...such as salmon belly and madai. Make a point to check it out!  AYCE Sushi is a category all to itself. I'm a fan of Umiya. For me they are a very strong 3 stars or a weak 4 stars, but I have to lean to 4 stars.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking up sushi places back at the hotel and decided to go to this one because of the high reviews. I've never been to an all you can eat sushi place before, but I've had some real good high quality sushi and a lot of yelpers said they have fresh sushi; so I had to give them a try.  It was near midnight and there were a few groups. We didn't have to wait, we sat at the sushi bar. I was real excited for the AYCE menu. We ordered a variety of sushi and sushi rolls. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice was hard and dry. It tasted as if they used regular rice instead of sushi rice. The sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. They were very simple and was not worth it.  I don't think I do very well at AYCEs. I was expecting really fresh fish, but they didn't deliver on quality. I'm beginning to think Las Vegas restaurants are overhyped. I've been to a few with high reviews, but they've only disappointed.  For the same price I could eat a simpler, but fresher sushi meal elsewhere. Our server was friendly and attentive, but the sushi chefs looked arrogant and rude. They didn't talk to us much and we ordered some sushi rolls from them, but they didn't seem happy and even frowned as us.   For some reason, I don't usually give second chances if my experience was horrible, but I want to come back when I'm in town; so I can see what this place has to offer. Perhaps it was a mishap, perhaps they do suck. Only a second visit will tell.",

I do have to say that the service is very good and at any point when our drinks were low they would come refill it without us asking. That is always nice and a change from most of the other sushi joint.   There were a few creative appetizer items such as the monkey bring, which was decent but over fried. We did order a bunch of nigiri sushi and for the most part the rice was huge and the piece of fish was very small. Generally I would say the ratio is terrible compared to many of the other places in town. I do like that they have a variety of other items on the menu there appetizer menu is quite extensive, and they have 5 different skewers as well. The quality of fish was decent, but we did order the salmon belly special item and it tasted very weird.  I would say overall a decent experience, but the rice ratio really made this place rather disappointing.",

    "text": "A popular recent discussion in Yelp Talk of Las Vegas has been about overrated businesses. Well, count me in as puzzled at the 4.5 star average rating of this restaurant.  I first tried Umiya Sushi back when I was frequently exploring different all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants. Although I did have a positive impression at the time, it ended up being a one-and-done visit until tonight because it wasn't nearly as good as other AYCE sushi spots. My group's options were more limited late at night though, and we settled on one of the closer ones.  There are certainly some positives this meal. Some of the highlights from my first visit were also standouts on this trip. I enjoyed the tuna sashimi with AJ sauce and the baked New Zealand mussels as much as any AYCE appetizer. The oysters were pretty fresh and decently sized. The fish katsu was a surprise hit with tender fish, a crunchy fried exterior, and just the right amount of sauce.  Tsubugai (whelk) was on the one-per-person specials menu. It was a first-time nigiri for me, and the flavor and chewiness was great. Unagi was spectacular, with a bit of extra caramelization than usual that gave texture and flavor. Yuzu hamachi (yelllowtail with citrus) and garlic tuna (albeit more sweet than garlicky) were also nice. The uni was above average in an AYCE context and had little of that \"dirty seawater\" issue that often plagues AYCE uni.  The rolls that I tasted weren't too bad either. Yellowtail Lovers with hamachi and spicy hamachi, and both of the no-rice rolls. I would have gone for more, but we were all getting pretty full  The list of letdowns is too long though. Soft-shell crab was fine, especially with soy sauce, but the shell was just a bit too hard and persisted while chewing (note: photo omitted due to low quality). Salmon was bland in all versions: salmon nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, and salmon kama. The kama was overcooked and dry as well. We have not been AYCE friends for a little bit too long, sadly. Screaming o salad was actually nice, but I only found three relatively thin slices of tuna in the huge bed of salad. You can't skimp like that on a one-per-person order.  Super white tuna nigiri was also boring. I do prefer unsauced ono, but this version was bland. I think this was also the nigiri that had a few hard grains of rice, which is rarely ever seen even with the lower standards of AYCE sushi. Amaebi (sweet shrimp) had the right texture but was also bland. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was one of the more boring versions that I've had. The grilled mackerel was also on the dry side. And both the green tea and plum wine ice cream scoops were a little icy and just seemed like another off-balance way to end the dinner (although the mango mochi was fine, probably because it's the standard packaged stuff).  The biggest lowlight was the mixed karai. My friend's bowl looked tempting with its assortment of fish, but I got the impression that my bowl was made wholly of thin discarded pieces and/or low-quality cuts. It was a chore to eat it, especially one of the big chunks of tuna. I found myself dipping the fish in soy sauce or leftover sauce from one of the no-rice rolls. I can't remember having a worse mixed seafood salad in town.  Service issues were again present. They somehow missed giving us the uni on the first order and we had to re-request it. Perhaps they gave it to another table? The servers seemed to constantly bring out superfluous items, forcing us to tell them that we hadn't ordered whatever it was. I just don't run into these issues with table dining at another AYCE sushi restaurants, so it's telling that it's happened 2 out of 2 times here.  Umiya is a passable AYCE sushi restaurant if your options are limited or if you're hanging out in the vicinity (such as the Strip or one of the Flamingo Rd casinos), but I really wouldn't mind staying away for another three years. There are simply far better options in the genre.",

And for the price, I hope they have good alcohol sales because it seems like they're giving away the sushi. I look forward to my next trip to Vegas and will definitely return.",

The rolls are pretty good, but they will definitely fill you up. I rarely even dipped the rolls in soy sauce since they already put their special sauces all over. I thought the appetizers were actually the best thing on the menu. Poke, seafood ceviche, seared tuna, oysters, and the fried soft shell crab were my favorites on the dinner menu. Don't forget to eat dessert! They have mochi ice cream, which can be kind of hard. Maybe they could defrost it a little? Overall pretty great.",

    "text": "Our table of 9 was..... disappointed.   So we checked in at 7:17p and we didn't have a table until about 8-8:10p.  See, that's not usually a problem since we understand that we're a large party arriving at dinner time so yes, we expected to wait quite a while. But after 40 minutes, we decided to sit inside the restaurant. we noticed that the hostesses has absolutely no idea of seating or planning. An entire table that could comfortably sit 10-12 people were occupied by a couple. One couple. They actually sat one couple down at a table that could easily fit ours.   Moving on. We ordered (ordering is already a pain since it seems like there's certain people only available to take orders and they seem to disappear as soon as you hold a menu in your hand). throughout our night, the food kept coming out like, in spurts. Like 4 dishes would come out. Then 15 minutes of nothing would come. I ordered nigiri and after 20 minutes, i accepted that it wasn't put in. So I ordered the same thing again and explained the situation to the waitress. After another 20 minutes, it still didn't come. Towards the very end of our meal, all of the nigiri came. Like really?   Annoyed, My sister's fiance actually asked a waitress if they have some sort of system or list that they cross off as the food is delivered to our table. She actually said no. Which explains the unpredictable timing of food, delay of food, and just ... it was chaos.   The food itself was, alright. My sister literally broke out in hives after eating at Umiya. The drive to find an open pharmacy was intense (they all seem to close at 11p by our house). For all parents with a child breaking out in hives: GET BENADRYL. it works faster! Today my sister's doctor said that the food might not have been fresh or the oil clean.   Our waitress saw 2 little rice pieces of rice (from the nigiri) and she immediately prompted us with a speech about how left over rice will be an extra charge. Wouldn't be a better idea to prompt us towards the END of our meal? Because my dad planned on eating the sushi rice with his soft shell crab...   I understand that we are a big party. And we always loved coming to Umiya. But the quality and service has been going downhill steadily. It hasn't actually affected us until now.",

    "text": "We tried this place cause it was recommended and also, it had good reviews. This review is for the AYCE. The fish was sub par on the warm side.  The handrolls were 85% rice with very little fish.  The cutrolls were doused in sauce and had very little fish.  They were definitely trying to get you full on the rice. To top it off, one of our servers chided us for leaving some rice in one of the handrolls. The same server came back and asked if we were going to finish what is on our table. We had to tell her we were still working on it. She was acting like the rice police...  Another server \"Hj L\" from the receipt, charged us adult price for our kid and when we corrected him since we told him the correct age from the start, he said I told him our kid was over the age. Why would I do that? He had the nerve to come back and tell me we got free oysters earlier because he thought my child was being charged the adult price.  Did he really need to cone back and tell me that? All in all a very bad experience.  The only plus was service provided by the 2 non-asian servers.  They were great! I'm Asian btw so I can say this. Definitely not coming back here.",

The oysters were perfect, each order was awesome.   Cons Server asked multiple times in a 10 minute window if everything's ok which was unnecessary, but then was Unseen the rest of the 25 minutes..we both needed refills, waited forever not wanting to press their Call-button on the table but decided to..made eye contact tried to get attention few times,..still nothing..waited pressed again..5 mins, nothing. Finally came up asked if ready for more or desserts said no we wanted drinks while back and rang the button thing twice in 10 mins dont think ours works. They got our check and card fast though!

When you walk in the atmosphere is a very Japanese semi outdoor picnic feel. The lighting is dim and the decorations makes it feel you're really in japan. The tables are very large and enough to order plenty of food.  I started with their spicy tuna salad and it had a lot of flavor and different types of fishes mix with it. My friends and I ordered several specials orders such as the Hawaiian roll, firecracker and all the dishes was delicious.  The staff was very friendly and the sushi chefs surprisingly made our food very fast even if though it was busy.  Thank you and we will be back!",

Was so happy to come back again and fill my belly with delicious sushi. This time around, the food was still really good and didn't take too long to get to our tables after we ordered. Service was different this time around.. Seemed like our server's mind was somewhere else because we had to repeat our orders several times for her to hear us and write it down. Everybody that dropped off our dishes was really friendly and helpful.   The restaurant itself is really spacious, so it makes it ideal for larger groups and there are plenty of regular tables for smaller parties.",

When I've gone on a Friday or Saturday night, they usually give an estimation of 30-45 minute wait; however, I've never waited more than 20 minutes or so. The all you can eat is a great deal. From my experience, it has the most appetizer items available as part of the AYCE menu. The udon soup is one of my favorites! As for the sushi and nigiri, it is absolutely delicious. I love how for most of their rolls, the sauce comes on the side, allowing you to decide how much to add to your roll rather than it being served smothered in sauce.  This is our go to place. Consistent and great every time.",

    "text": "Umiya wasn't the best AYCE I've ever had, but it satisfied my sushi cravings!   Nigiri: A majority of what I order at AYCE is nigiri. Most of it was pretty fresh! The yellowtail was subpar, but the ika, halibut, uni, salmon, surf clams, sweet shrimp, and tuna tasted fresh. The oysters are especially fresh! The one thing that I didn't like at all was the rice. It's overcooked and doesn't go well with the fish. I've noticed that many Korean-owned sushi places don't get the sushi rice quite right.   Rolls: The roll that stood out was the Kiss of Fire roll, which is great if you're a fan of spice.   Appetizers: The bacon-wrapped scallop and octopus skewers were pretty good! The poke was really underwhelming, but I did just get back from Hawaii.   Entrees: The udon is pretty good, but the ramen and yakisoba are really disappointing. Both lacked flavor and the necessary consistency.   Service: What bumped up my review from three to four stars! They're really attentive and friendly! They constantly check up on you and don't avoid you like they do at mos AYCE sushi places I've been to.   Overall, I'm not ever really a fan of AYCE. I would rather just go to a good quality place and order a reasonable amount of food, but I enjoyed my experience at Umiya. I think it's worth trying out.",

Sat at the bar and the workers were nonstop talking to each other in Korean which is cool, but they completely ignored us the entire time and I felt like I was annoying them  to interject an order. It was like we weren't even there.  Now to the food. TOO MUCH SAUCE!  My first roll came drenched in this oily sauce where I couldn't even pick up a piece of the roll without it crumbling. The rice was cold and hard and just horrible. My girlfriend tried one piece and didn't even want to finish it with me.  I ordered another roll after that and asked the guy if he could put the sauce on the side.  He called the order out to someone else and the thing came drenched in this oily nasty sauce AGAIN where you can't even taste what fish you are having...couldn't tell if it was red snapper or tuna or salmon.   Pissed me off that he totally ignored my request for sauce on the side.  I ordered another roll...told him PLEASE NO SAUCE.  He calls out the order to have one of his friends make it...and how does it come?  COMPLETELY SOAKED in sauce a third time. My girlfriend who hated the sauce, just ate ramen and was disgusted by the whole experience.  I've been to many AYCE joints that try to pull a little fusion with these different sauces, some creamy, some spicy, some whatever in an attempt to try and compliment the roll (so I'm not a total sauce Nazi)...but this place DESTROYS it's sushi with this nasty oily sauce that doesn't compliment the sushi whatsoever and makes it unbearable to finish.   This was my worst AYCE sushi experience in Vegas to date.   Get your act together, listen to your customers...and give a shit about their requests.   Your sauce is effing gross. I didn't come to eat half a bottle of oil based Ken's salad dressing.",

Service was awesome but we went in between lunch/dinner time so it was not busy. Their appetizers are better than most ayce sushi places and the rolls are decent.

Who's Your Daddy is a big favorite of mine!  The service is ALWAYS on point!  Everyone is ALWAYS in a great mood and everyone is willing to assist with All of the Tables!!  Love this place can't get enough!",

There's a lot of variety on their menu.  Most AYCE places in So Cal have a few appetizer choices and then nigiri and rolls.  Umiya has a ton of appetizers, salad options and some yakitori as well.  The sushi is pretty fresh as well.  The only thing I didn't like was the nigiri had a bit too much rice. Also, if you check in on yelp, you get a free soda.",

    "text": "The quality and selection for AYCE at $25? Who knew there would be such a hidden gem right behind The Palms Hotel. I had it for the first time coming back from a 3 day camping/hiking trip to Zion, and let me tell you. We killed it. It was so good that I went again the very next week while I was in Vegas... But it's so good! And so close to the strip.  Honestly I would put it on same the level as Bacchanal. I know they're totally different, but on my scale of buffet/AYCE choices... Umiya is pretty up there with Bacchanal. Hands down better than Wicked Spoon.   The UNI... So good. But sadly its limited to one order.. So is the SWEET SHRIMP, AJ SAUCE TUNA. All the ones labeled 1D. But that just means you know it's bomb! So order all them 1Ds.   They have ramen too and it's pretty good. Pretty large selection in sushi, rolls, and appetizers. TUNA SALAD, SUNRISE ROLL, FIRST KISS ROLL, PORK BELLY, BAKED MUSSELS, ETC! They let you get half orders of rolls too so you can try as many as you want.  Oh and don't forget the green tea mochi icecream and green tea tempura for dessert. :)  They have a huge screen showing a mix of Kpop and top20s style music videos on one wall and then a TV with like some random news channel on the opposite wall. So just a warning, whichever side of the table you end up choosing on... You will have a very different scenery for the next 1.5hrs. Because that's the time limit; you'd think that's enough time, but it goes by pretty quickly!   Anyways, the people there are all really nice too. They'll tell you what's good if you don't know what to order too. Super helpful and friendly!",

They not only had sushi, but also pork belly, poke(one time order) salads, etc. another good thing is that the rolls are offered as half rolls. This made it easier to try various rolls. From rainbow rolls, to tempura rolls, to scallop rolls, if you can name it, it was probably there. One thing is They do charge for food that is uneaten/ wasted but I didn't have that problem. I plan to visit when I am in town. It was well worth the lyft ride there.",

When going in, I thought it would be packed since a lot of the reviewers have said that it's a good place.  For us, our experience was just decent. Nothing amazing or great. Even though we were just the only table being served, these servers are still slow. When being asked for more food & serving them were extremely slow and they expect us to have that 90 minutes limit? No way. Unfair.   With that being said, I would rather go to some place else. Makino was the best one for us.",

    "text": "Right when I walked in, it reminded me of another sushi place I've been to & it didn't click until we got the check that it is Kaizen (also in Vegas)!   My friends & I came here about a month ago because we were craving AYCE sushi & wanted to try someplace new. The reviews looked good on Yelp, so why not?   There were a couple of good things going for this place. It is a BIG space, which is nice compared to smaller sushi places like Goyemon or Sushi Koma. Another nice thing is that their nigiri is small, which we liked so we could have more of the other sushi.  Now, onto the bad. The biggest thing I did not like was their service. We ordered the first round of sushi & rolls - which was fine. Then a couple more. Then we decided to ask the waiter for recommendations. We ordered some of the special rolls since our first round of sushi was mainly nigiri. Well, the waiter who brought our rolls brought the wrong rolls! & the original waiter LEFT FOR THE DAY. Wait, what?! I'm used to places introducing the second waiter or at least letting us know if they are taking a break or leaving. So, of course, we're telling this new waiter that the rolls he brought us are NOT the ones we ordered. He kept saying one was the lobster roll & we had a shrimp tempura roll - which was the same thing! So we had these two baked rolls (that were the same!) which are heavy, so of course we got full faster. We didn't send one of those rolls back which was our fault, but in the end, they didn't charge us for what we didn't finish, so I guess we're even.",

(once again) Most of my previous experiences in sushi places in Vegas were pretty good, but the ones with really good sushi lacked in choices for appetizers or good appetizers with bad sushi. Sometimes it would be good sushi in a run down place.   Umiya has it all! Really good choices in appetizers, amazingly fresh sushi ( a la carte fresh!), trendy indoor decor, and friendly staff!   It seems like there is always one person in a large group does not like sushi. No worries! With so many choices in appetizers, and a lot of non-sushi items, your group can have a pleasant dinner without someone going hungry.   For all you sake lovers, chef Alex has many exotic sake from all over in Japan that will suffice your thirst. Chef Alex is very picky when it comes to purchasing his fish and you will be very pleased with the quality of your food.",

The nigiri is pretty good (better than most AYCE places) but it's the endless stream of delicious goodies from the kitchen that you will never find at other AYCE places. The cheese salmon sticks, the pork belly, the soft-shell crab -- they nailed all of these, and kept them coming with great service and a friendly attitude.  Very, very impressive.",

I really like how many options you get and they all taste amazing--ribeye steak with the aju, great combinations of shrimp and meat skewers, and the one thing I always look forward to is the tuna poke. Most places give you that 10:1 ratio of seaweed to poke but Umiya likes to do things the other way around. It's pretty much all poke. And I love it.  Service. I can't rave enough about how phenomenal the service is. Their chefs and servers are on point. From the time we sat down and order, the food arrived in 4 minutes. The people here are machines and they do it all with the biggest smile. Coming here with just my girlfriend or with a large group of friends, this level of service has been consistent.  Quality of fish. Top of the charts. Uni is so fresh I felt like I caught it and cut the gonads off myself. And the oysters don't have that musky slimy texture that you'd often find at other places. It goes without saying that the ingredients in the rolls and sushi are the same high quality.   Overall, you will not be disappointed with choosing Umiya. As locals, we are always looking for the next and greatest sushi restaurant but Umiya is a timeless classic.",

The first time in I went up to the bar to see the fish.  Well they don't display the fish here so no looking at what you're going to order like most sushi places.  One of the sushi chefs yells at me \"What do you want sir?\"  I asked him \"What is fresh tonight\"  Him, \"EVERTHING IS FRESH!\"  Me;  Okay, then what do you recommend? What is the freshest?\"  Him:  \"EVERTHING IS THE FRESHEST!\"  I kind of knew right then that this was not an honest place.  The good:  Tempura, fish katsu, Tuna poke with seaweed salad (excellent!!).  We had this twice and I would get it again.  Salad was fresh and tasty.  Good rice too.  The bad:  the \"no-rice\" roll with crab was actually Krab (Pollack) and daikon radish and cucumber.  It tasted essentially like daikon radish and the 6 slices were no more than a 1/4 inch thick ($12.00???) We actually sent this back it tasted so bad.  The worst other bad:  Seafood Chirashi:  I've had this dish many many times at other establishments and I always get 10 to 11 different types of raw seafood over rice.    Here I got tomago, tuna, a light fish I could not identify, a single small cooked shrimp, salmon and tobiko.  The fish was sliced very thin to make it appear like more was there.  Half the bowl was covered with shredded radish as filler.  What a joke.  I could see straight away that the tuna was bad (dark and sagging), one sniff and I moved it to the side.  Next I smell the light colored fish and it seems okay so I try it and nope, its bad too.  Also warm!!  Had to spit it out type of bad.  I had to send the whole dish back and ordered the fish katsu again which was excellent.  They did not charge for the Chirashi but they did not own up to the fact that the fish was bad.  I know they will read this and think I am full of it but seriously guys I've been eating and MAKING sushi for 30 years.  Also, just read the reviews where people claim food poisoning from your fish.  I am sure it is True.  Lastly, quit bribing people to give you 5-star reviews.  It looks really bad.",

Our bill only came out to like $37 between the two of us. We got the miso soup and some other stuff too. We were way impressed. We're going to be coming back when we stay at the Palms Place again next year. It was packed here too, and we had to wait. That's another indication that this might be a favorite by people in the area.",

Service: For me, service is something that I cannot reiterate enough. It is the break or make it factor for me and sadly, the service can do a little bit of cleaning. I have been here a handful of times and I get the same service... rudeness. I am not sure if the servers are being purposely rude, but the last three times I have been there (less than a month), they have been rude. I was trying to order something at the bar one time and the lady who was taking care of our orders rudely said that she will come back to us and take orders from her other tables. I understand that me and my party was not ready, but she did not have to be rude and impatient. I was baffled by how she reacted to the situation with me and my party. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that has happened. I am constantly getting rude service. Also, I happen to get new servers every time I go there. I do not know who is taking care of me at the end of my experience.  Quality: The food and quality of fish is amazing. Even though I do not get service how I am used to getting, the food can help balance it. The seared tuna AJ fish is to die for! I constantly crave it and come back for it. They also have special yuzu hamachi nigiri and salmon belly. it tastes so good and so fresh I cannot have enough of it! They also have an array of sushi rolls, appetizers and other stuff that they have on the menu. They have a lot of things on their menu that a lot of other sushi restaurants set them apart.  Overall, I am very impressed with their menu. It really sets them apart from other sushi restaurants and they have their own style. However, service can be so much better. If all the servers were willing to give their 100% everyday no matter how late is or early, then this place would be my favorite places in Vegas. If they didn't have good items on their menu, I wouldn't be back because of their service.",

Our server was friendly and fast..   We both did the AYCE dinner ($26.96)  and started off with: -tuna poke salad (1/pp)- good chunks of tuna, nice marinade and not too much salad -seared salmon salad (1/pp)- I liked the salmon quality and it came on a bed of greens & daikon -salmon skin salad- I wish the salmon skin was crispier -raw oyster (2pieces/pp)- wasn't the best quality but better than Hikari's  -seared tuna sashimi with AJ sauce (2pieces/pp)- good quality I liked the sauce it was creamy & tangy -agedashi tofu- yummy -softshell crab- these were HUGE  -monkey brain- spicy tuna stuffed avocado.. it's deep-fried but doesn't mention that on the menu -grilled yellowtail- was kind of dry and they were out of salmon & yellowtail collar  Then we got assorted nigiri: -quality- ok...it's not that it was bad but the fish quality was just not all there for me.. Some things like the ikura tasted SUPER fishy and the coloring on some of the fish like the tuna was dull and not appetizing.. Also they charge extra for quail egg and soy paper even when you do AYCE.. They don't have fresh scallops on the menu :( What I did LOVE was their fish to rice ratio.. they give you very little rice.. YAY ;]]]   I also noticed some things we ordered never made it to the table like baby octopus skewers, pork belly, fried shrimp heads.. So there must have been some miscommunication with the kitchen..   Like I said over-all experience was a 3.5... I think I will come back for a lunch bento box or back if they did some Happy Hour prices on their apps and rolls but maybe not for AYCE.. well not until they step up their fish quality game haha ~   HOT TIP: ask about their drink specials.. it seems they always have some sort of promotion going on!",

It sounds like I'm being a diva, but it needs to be said! You can't happily eat your weight in AYCE sushi if your butt starts to hurt.  The food, though, is good. The sushi rice seemed to be lacking the vinegar, but it wasn't a huge deal considering this is an AYCE place. Service was quick and friendly. Nigiri is yummy but the rolls kind of all taste similar. There are a quite a few reviews on here stating that the seafood wasn't fresh, but I did not find that to be an issue on my visit.   I think I have really high standards when it comes to sushi places, but this is a solid sushi spot and I'd be willing to come back again if I was in the area.",

A friend was at running a booth at CES so i took him to this place. Just the two of us. Perfect! Good was great. The waitresses was very attentive to our needs. Cool. So 7 days later when my friend's last day at CES. We decided to go here as a group with my family and his family plus a friend. Total 6 of us. Bad! Service was horrible. It seemed as though they wanted us to hurry up and eat and leave. The table next to us cam it after us and they were given more attention than our table. My friends wife ask for low sodium soy sauce. They charged us $1.50. Not a big deal but i dont recall regular soy sauce and low sodium soy sauce were much different in price at the market. After our dinner we were charged a service fee. Which most of the time i would give more. But this time I didn't the server deserve what any tip. Her service was horrible. So my suggestion is dont go here if you have a big group.  Food is good not going to lie. I will be back but not as a big group",

They might have several items which has a limit, like oysters, uni, sweet shrimp, rib eye beef, soft shell crab, but the quality are really good. Oysters are pacific oysters from Washington that are clean and fresh.  They do have a limit of 90 minutes for ayce so that you dont have to sit there and eat all day. What a great location too 7 minutes walk from the palms casino.  Ayce is only 25.99 for dinner. A tip is to order all the items that has a limit first so that you can have more room for the best stuff. Also the seating area might be a bit busy at the front, but the booths are better and more spacious. The servers are mostly Korean, but they have pretty good team work. The restaurant is located near Starbucks so free wifi.",

    "text": "TLDR: AYCE (90 minute time limit) and lunch specials available; yelp check-in deal; hit-or-miss service  My friend and I like to venture over to Umiya when we're looking for a decent meal. They have the standard AYCE prices with dinner specials available such as salmon kama or a specialty appetizer item. Their lunch specials are pretty decent and filling if you're looking for something to take home or if you just want an entree. We like to check-in and get a free soda or iced green tea (the real deal and not the Coca-Cola one).   One thing that this location offers is the super white tuna or ono. I've been noticing that some restaurants are choosing not to carry this item, due to a supplier issue, but I'm happy to enjoy it at this location. Is it True super white? Who knows, but it sure tastes like it. They have interesting dessert-style specialty rolls which contain fruit and eel sauce. If you're getting AYCE, you might as well split a half roll.  We've come here a couple of times and it's safe to say that service depends on the moon and the stars, the Dow Jones, or the shape of the clouds because I don't get it. Whether busy or slow, the service can be super quick or patiently long and I'm just talking about placing an order, not to receive the food. I often have to ask for refills and usually have to flag someone down to get something. Myabe this speaks for the lack of adequate staffing. Who knows? Either way the food is pretty good.  Note: They're offering free mugs for posting of reviews. Will this lead to an oversampling of 5-star reviews? Probably. Did I get a cup for this? Not yet, but who doesn't want a free cup?",

    "text": "BAD SERVICE. We called ahead to see what the waiting time was like. Woman was quick and snappy and hung up before we could ask another question. My boyfriend and I go anyways and it takes a while to get seated. Not bad, we expected as much.   We got waters and lay down our first round of orders. This was okay, but after this service slowed down. I was feeling a little sick soon after and this might've been because of the quality of food.   We'd be constantly overlooked and ignored and we were in the middle of the restaurant! I'd watch other tables get serviced except for us. Service is just bad. They let people wait up front when there are clearly tables empty and ready to go. They say AYCE can only last 90 minutes, but we can't help how long we stay when no one takes our orders!   This was our second time eating here and service was still just as poor(first time was a few months ago). Bathrooms were dirty as well. Food was good for the most part, just bad service.",

What a major disappointment this place was. Service was terrible; we had to ask for someone to take our order because the staff was busy chatting. We had to ask for our drinks twice. The teriyaki beef was so tough that I couldn't chew it. I ordered scallop & bacon skewers and got shrimp and bacon instead. Several dishes ordered we didn't get and got tired of trying to wave somebody down to ask for them finally just giving up. Sauces are thick and mayo based with zero flavor. Spicy tuna is NOT spicy. My friend who loves AYCE sushi places said it was the worst one she had ever been to so I guess that says it all !!!",

I liked almost all the dishes that came out, but I wouldn't waste your time on the steak. It looked pretty, but tasted just ok.  My favorites were a Creamy shrimp fried appetizer and the First Kiss. Both delish!  Oh yeah, and a lobster dish which I tasted off someone else's plate. Yum!  Also, we came with a large group and had to sit at their bigger tables, which have horrible no-back bench seating.  If you come with up to 4 people, they have normal comfortable chairs at their smaller tables.  I would come again, but with a smaller group so I could sit comfortable.",

They left out a roll of sushi from my order and never came back for our bill. My guest and I walked to the front to pay. Due to lack of attention is why I'd recommend somewhere else. Time in Vegas is valuable and fast service is appreciated but the least any restaurant can do is be attentive. 3 stars for this Japanese crew. Good sushi but there are other places nearby just as good. So much for the bellman recommendation.",

The menu had a lot of different options. I can't remember any cause we tried so many. All I can say is that the food was fresh, the fish was of good quality, and the service was great. The food came fast and the servers were very attentive; our glasses never went empty. I liked the variety of music that was playing (along with the music videos). The were a variety of desserts on the menu that did not disappoint as well.   Would recommend this place to any of my friends and would 10/10 come back.",

First, when I walked in, the waitress who works on Tuesday day shift already seem not happy about her job. Then, she sat us at the front table nearest the front entrance and it is 105 degrees outside and they have so many table available. I asked her nicely if I can sit at other table instead. Do you know what she said to me? She said you have to sit here and you can't move to another tables . WTF! The problem I have with her is her fxxking attitude and her facial expression that make me sick. If she doesn't want to be a server, quit and do something else. Then I went to the Chef and let him know what's going on. All the Chef always been great to us when we go there. Then me and my family decided to walk out because I really don't want to see her face for another 45 minutes. I believe one bad server can easily ruin up the restaurant and other people hard work. MANAGER! Please do something about this young waitress. THANK YOU!",

    "text": "Husband and I decided to try Umiya for a lunch date before a movie. We don't live on that side of town so I googled sushi places in the zip code of the theater and Umiya came up with great reviews.   We were seated promptly after walking in however it took about 10 minutes before someone offered drinks or a menu. Once we had menus several people stopped in a 3 minute span to ask if we wanted to order.   They were prompt in getting rolls and nigiri out. As far as the nigiri it was reallllly good. They werent overly thick or large pieces. I also had a screaming O salad with tuna and it was delicious. The spicy garlic Edamame was cold and tasted like it was tossed in just sriracha with no garlic.  The rolls left a little to be desired.they tasted alright.  They were not very neat. What I mean is they were messy. One roll we ordered kept coming unrolled when we would use the chopstick to grab a piece. One roll had an excess of crunch on top. I'm all for crunch I really am but it went everywhere, I have never had crunch on a Japanese lasagna either. There wasn't anything special about the sauces on top (if any.) mostly just straight sriracha or eel sauce. One roll came out to us with no sauce but the description had a ponzu sauce and spicy mayo so we couldn't tell if it was even the right roll. Now I know you're thinking well did you tell someone. We tried. After several failed attempts we just ate it. One thing I really liked was they offer macarons! My husband loves mochi, I do not so when I saw chocolate macorons I was pretty excited and they were good! Another odd thing was our table was not level. It kept wobbling back and forth which is slightly irritating while eating.   Recap: nigiri was great (salmon,tuna, yellow tail and red snapper) the rolls were meh but they weren't awful. The wobbling table was irritating and it seemed either every waiter showed up in 2 minutes to ask if you wanted to order or they disappeared for 10 minutes all together.",

    "text": "Went here with bf on a Monday night. Not a busy night for the restaurant. There were only about 5 to 6 tables occupied with just a couple per table.   I noticed immediately that the service was a little slow and was a little unorganized. We were seated though immediately but the orders were taken after 15 minutes. I mentioned it was kind of unorganized because after the male server took our orders, after 5 minutes the female server approached our table and asked if our orders were taken.  Now let's rate the food...  I can say the fish quality was good, fish was very fresh and firm (Nigiris).  Grilled seafood was so so... I've eaten better.  Deep fried items were also so so... The soft shell crab that I ordered was drenched in oil. Also they don't put the dipping sauce on the side but they just drizzle it and it makes the dish more wet rather than crispy and light on the outside and moist in the inside  Rolls were okay... I ordered the Tuna Tataki (Rating: 7 out of 10) and Snow White (4 out of 10).   I can say though that the Seared Tuna with AJ sauce was something different and it was really good. Too bad it's only 1 order per person.  Desserts... Also ordinary and it's one per person too. We tried the mango mochi and tempura ice cream.  Maybe we will be back, I say Goyemon is still the best AYCE in town!",

Everything on the menu is available for all you can eat, unlike some places that have a separate AYCE menu.  There are also the standard exceptions of a few items that you can only get one order per person.    I usually habit Goyemon, but wanted to try something different today. I dragged a few friends along, and this place really hit the spot for everyone. Fish was really fresh. We had giant clam, uni, sweet shrimp, oysters, baked mussel, yellow tail, salmon, soft shell crab, a bunch of rolls.... And much more. They were all delicious! Definitely would recommend the Snow White roll, the spicy tuna rice cracker and the Seared tuna with AJ sauce.  The spicy garlic edamame was great too.  Only complaints are that the agedashi tofu did not have much broth - basically fried tofu with a little sauce on it, and the ahi poke had too much sesame oil that you could barely taste the fish.  Also, drinks are not included.  I had to pay extra for hot tea ($1.75).   And they were out of a few dishes like yellow tail collar and scallops.  Also limited to one dessert per person and no stamp cards.  Despite my complaints, the menu is all encompassing and I will likely be back to try more dishes.",

Lol To start off with some recommendations; we started with the seared tuna with AJ sauce, it was very fresh and had great flavor. The baked muscles are probably the best I've ever had! We ordered monkey brains which is avocado and spicy tuna fried which was seriously AMAZING. All the rolls we ordered (first kiss, kiss of fire, Japanese lasagna, seafood volcano, & the  green chili one) the one that stood out the most was the seafood volcano. Although all rolls were very fresh and flavorful, this one was my favorite! Another cool thing is that you get dessert with the AYCE which is always a plus :) There are other items on the menu I wish we could of tried like the skewers and jalapeno poppers, but that's for next time! The staff was extremely friendly and the place looks very clean and such a nice vibe. Love the little button at your table where you can alert them if you need a refill, your check, or just to order more food. Highly recommend this place. My husband and I have been looking for a new sushi place with some quality fish & this place is just that and more!",

Maybe the kitchen was low in staffing since it took them about 15 minutes to get a few small plates out. The service was poor since they never filled our drinks and kept forgetting our dishes/giving it to another table. You have to be careful and remember what limited items you order. They are not organized with the orders at all and tried to tell me that I had ordered the limited items already. I know I've ordered it but it didn't go to my table. Once or twice I will understand but 4 times and telling me it was delivered, I really think it's their fault now. For example: When I ordered the uni and the sweet shrimp together they would bring out the sweet shrimp and not the uni. So I asked about the order and was told it's out already. Same thing with the single baby octopus, amaebi head, 2 rolls were not received but ordered. The food was 3.5 stars. Nothing I would crave or come back for. It's just an average sushi spot. The reason why I decided to try thid spot was the 4.5 stars on Yelp. I should've known better and just stick to the spot I prefer. (kaya).",

High ceilings, good lighting, and a screen playing music videos of everything from Rihanna to Girls Generation. Everything you want in a sushi spot! *kidding*  I usually only order nigiri + appetizers. They have nice cuts of fish which so far, have always been fresh. Rice is solid. However, if you're a roll person, my friend ordered a few which were pretty delicious. Their appetizer menu is larger than most. I would say it's comparable to that of OYSHI. My favorites being the spicy garlic edamame and spicy tuna crispy rice.   Service has always been up to par. The servers are generally friendly and attentive. It's never so crazy busy in there that you feel as though you're ignored and can't put an order in.  Note: Last call is at 1:30am. No AYCE after 1:00am, just a la carte. They also have a sushi chef which has a THUG LIFE tattoo. Because that is absolutely relevant.",

The fact that it wasn't busy allowed the chef to make me their favorite rolls.  I always asked for chef's choice for nigiri.  Since, it was my first time at this establishment, I asked the chef to just order me anything.  First order by the chef was Tuna Sashimi in special AJ sauce (WOW, sauce was freaking incredible!), baked mussells were good, crispy lobster roll was really good, and I couldn't forget the ocean  salmon nigiri which was so buttery.  The latter was probably the highlight of my meal. Don't forget to order the Soft shell crab appetizer, the batter was so good!  Service was excellent.  One of the best AYCE sushi I ever had.",

Officially my favorite AYCE sushi place...too bad it's all the way in Las Vegas :/  Let me start off by saying that the service was spectacular...stellar...mindblowingly good! Not only was the staff incredibly helpful and on point, but even the chef/owner came out to make our experience that much better. He personally recommended most of the dishes that we had that night and made quite a few of them himself, even throwing a few lessons on fish quality and freshness our way.  I wish I could remember what we had that night, but unfortunately I have no recollection of the names. I do suggest trying the dishes on their \"Specials\" board...they were all fantastic. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. Everything was fresh and had a unique twist to regular dishes.  Located a few minutes away from the Palms and like 10 minutes off the Strip, but it is 100% worth the drive. Very reasonably priced as well.",

    "text": "Typically, Umiya would be my go to spot if I know Goyemon will be crowded.  I attempted my usual Umiya trip a few nights ago and left after 15 minutes of there being open tables and not being sat down.  I realized the boys working were a bit new, as the ladies who sit people down and take their orders weren't working that night.    The ladies working know me already and the treatment that night by the males were pretty bad.  It looks like they were overwhelmed and I saw that people were waiting to order again but weren't being taken care of.  So instead of anticipating a bad night of sushi, I left to go to Sushi Bay instead, where I know there wouldn't be a wait to order.  Take notes from the female co-workers guys..only go when the ladies are working.",

They give you so many options and very little restrictions as far the AYCE rules go. The servers are very friendly and quick with your order. I like that there's usually 2-3 different workers that'll assist with taking your order and refilling the drinks.   The shrimp lover roll, dragon roll, Lisa Lisa roll, shrimp skewers and mussels here are beyond amazing! Every roll I've had here I've loved, those were just to name a few and keep the list short. This is definitely my favorite sushi spot in Vegas!",

My husband loves the Orange Blossom Roll, Touchdown Roll, Fried Pork Belly, Poke, Fried Shrimp Heads, and Sashimi. I'm not one for raw foods so,I usually get the fully cooked ones like the Lisa Lisa Roll which Shrimp Tempura, Avocado,Cucumber,Philly Cheese topped with Crunch and Eel sauce. This place is usually busy round the clock on the major meal times so I would go in between meals in order to get faster service. This place has yet to let me down!!",

We had cucumber salad (different from most), seaweed salad, nigiri, rolls, the tuna sashimi, soft shelled crab, Vegas lasagna roll, riceless rolls (my hubby loved both kinds), etc., etc. All delicious. The bacon wrapped scallop was delicious. I don't think you can go wrong here.  Service was amazingly fast and efficient. Nothing was forgotten. No request was refused with the exception of changing the ingredients in a roll. No substitutions.  Definitely worth a try!",

We sat at the bar and we were able to order quickly. I was able to customize my roll. Chef Alex was extremely nice and suggested different rolls to my boyfriend. He liked every single one. He was extremely nice to us and very friendly. Made us feel like a valued regular customer even though it was our first time we ever visited that restaurant.   Chef Alex personally introduced himself as the owner of the restaurant and he invited us to try another of his signature rolls for the next time.   We recommend this restaurant and we're definitely going back since the service was outstanding and the prices were not bad either!",

The tonkotsu ramen is really tasty just not really rich. Oh I almost forgot if you guys have ever had the seafood salad from Yama sushi the spicy tuna salad is on par with that man!

It's clean, refreshing, and a great roll to start off the meal since it has no rice. I'm not sure how long these items will be on the specials, but the yuzu yellowtail, salmon belly, and ocean trout are some of the best nigiri I've ever had. I love their appetizer menu! The fried softshell crab is soooo good! It comes with some kind of dijon sauce. You can only order one though so enjoy it while it lasts. They also have green tea tempura ice cream. I usually ask them for a green tea tempura ice cream banana split or I do it with the vanilla. I just let you in on a secret, so you better order it lol. Try this place out!

I have been there three times now, and I never leave a bad review until its happened a few times, because some times stuff happens. But, this is bad, every time I go the service is terrible. I had to order my food multiple times, I received other peoples orders, I never received parts of my order, and even after ordering rolls and nigiri multiple times, the server came over 20 minutes later and asked \"would you like to order anything more?\". I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN MY FOOD YET. WTF. so weird. They seem chaotic and unorganized. I ordered a total of 40 pieces of hamachi nigiri and ended up eating 8 pieces, my wife and I laughed about it. This place is amazing and has great potential but seriously needs work on their service. Get organized!

    "text": "This place used to be called Kaizen and they didn't have the AYCE sushi.  But one Friday night, my wife and I were looking for an AYCE sushi spot and we saw this place and everywhere else was a crazy 1-1.5 hr wait.  So we decided to try the place out.  We immediately took to it because of the atmosphere and it was spacious.  It wasn't crowded nor was the place like most sushi spots where it's small and compact and there's barely any room to walk on.   The staff was very friendly and warm.  The menu is very extensive! It actually has 4 whole pages of food, including a huge amount of foods that aren't seafood-ish.  I know many people would say, \"why go to a sushi spot and not eat seafood or sushi?\"  Well some people have something called \"allergies\" and we don't want them excluded, especially since I have a brother who is allergic to shellfish and a nephew who is allergic to freshwater fish.  So, it was really awesome that they had plenty of great choices for those who cannot enjoy certain aspect of sushi eating.  Including steak, teriyaki, noodles, beef, pork and chicken dishes.    My favorite is Snow White and the Ono nigiri.  But. their Tuna sashimi w/ AJ sauce is to die for.  My wife loves the oysters and she said that their uni is very fresh.  The food is just all around very good, fresh and well prepared.  We loved the place so much, we went back with our family the next evening.  AND we would definitely be going back again!",

The fish to rice ratio was decent not the best I've had at a ayce sushi but not the worst. I tend to order mostly nigiri when I go and avoid mostly rolls. The freshness of the fish was pretty good and the appetizers were also good especially the fried soft shell crab, too bad it was limit one.   They're open till 2am but last call is 1am for all you can eat. It's a decent size restaurant and service was good. Time limit 1 1/2 hour.  My only complaint and the reason they didn't receive 5 stars is they limit certain appetizers and the black board specials to 1 per person. At some ayce sushi places in Vegas they do not limit you.",

There is a huge selection of cooked items like baked mussels, calamari, chicken or beef skewers, etc, edamame, soups, etc. They offer a fes salads, nigri and pages of rolls.  Some items, like Uni will be limited to 1 order pp.  We had a delicious roll wrapped in cucumber which is a rare find on an AYCE menu as is Uni. We had tuna, albacore, yellowtail, salmon, octopus, seared albacore and halibut sushi (like 4 pieces pp of each) the poke which is served with seaweed salad, the spicy tuna on crispy rice and a few other items.  Nice option is certain rolls can be made 1/2 order.  For me, the pieces of fish were very long and super thin, while fresh I do prefer a fuller piece of fish but with AYCE I guess they figure you will just order more pieces.  They do use very little rice which is so nice.  Large, open restaurant very friendly staff and a super clean restroom.",

The only complaint I have is that they pack their rice balls so tight for the nigiri. I think they do it to make it look like there is less rice but I'd rather them not because it makes it so much harder to chew each piece.   The appetizers and non sushi items are great here. My favorite is the crispy rice with spicy tuna! So good. Another favorite is the rib eye steak. Medium rare is the way to go. It's served as a thin slice on a wooden platter with some dipping sauce on the side.   Service is great here. We had a party of 17 so they were prepared and took our orders by table. It was pretty organized. They were able to split the bill a couple times for our convenience. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. No complaints on customer service!",

Order the available nigris they had. Ranging from classic tuna to sweet shrimp. I also had the rolls, which they can do half order. The waiting staff is very attentive. The busser do ask if you are satisfied or need any assistance.    As much I enjoyed eating from it. There are a few things that bothered me:  - I had ordered Uni and had a shell piece in. It was quite noticeable.  - I had a order that I waited longer than usual. Turns out it was given to the person next to me - One of the roll I received was cold. A tempura based one.   The service was exceptional fare for both ends of the house. I was very pleased with most of the items and selection and as well expectation. The only criticism I have if the chefs could be more wary of the food they produce and given to. I had the courtesy of sitting near the Expo/Lead cook. The available of items is exceptionally. If it weren't for the quality and the front of the house's good management, I would had a worse outlook on Umiya.  I would come back again. If I'm back in town.",

We ordered only 3 TIMES with all you can eat. Between we were waiting for order. It look the ridiculous wait like 20mins each time to have their attention.

For 90 minutes , we did a marathon eating, round by round. My fave is the oyster, just the right size although this one is limited to oysters per person. That is why I am rating it 4 stars. I could eat only this. Luckily, 4 of my party did not eat oysters so I got their part. I like their style that  everything is in small plates except the sushi. This way we do not feel guilty leaving food unfinished.The tuna poke was very good. Over all the experience was satisfying including the service. I just wished I could have more oysters.   Sorry, the pork belly and the crispy chicharon wasnt theirs. We were in a road trip and got the pics mixed up",

All-you-can-eat is $26 for dinner time and $21 for lunch time. You can order ANYTHING you want off of the expansive menu. We got plate after plate of Nigiri: salmon, Baby scallops (my fave), salmon eggs, yellowtail, eel, jalapeno poppers, naked mussels etc.  we are from the LA area here for the weekend and we are SO happy with our dinner choice here",

In the last 3 times I've been there, I've noticed changes within the freshness/quality of the food, the amount of the fish went down so now you're eating more rice etc. Maybe they changed the owner? I have no clue but I was regular in this place and I'm sure there are changes. I think it's very hard to be consistent in this field, this is why I went there 3 times before I chose to stop going, just to make sure it wasn't a bad day or something.  I wish it wasn't like this because it was my \"AYCE Sushi\" go to place, no I just need to find another place - any suggestions?",

    "text": "I'm not sure why the reviews on this place is rated so highly...  I came here this past weekend after a long trafficy drive from LA. I called Umiya Sushi on the way there and ask how long the wait it would be for 2 people. They told me it was around 15-20 minutes. I didn't mind and I was hungry so we drove here anyway. It was about 3/4 full and we got seated fairly quickly (didn't end up waiting 15-20 min).   We decided to just go with AYCE and not the a la carte menu because we thought it would be around the same price. I do understand they have a 90 minute time limit for dining in. To be honest, I usually don't take that long to eat as long as the food comes out in a decent time period. They were very pushy and I felt very rushed while eating. I had not even been there for 30 minutes and at least 3 people came by and kept trying to get us to order more food. I see their tricks...order fast, fill up on rice, gtfo quicker. No thanks. Just wanted to enjoy my sushi.  Their fish was decent but man...they put so much rice on their rolls. Ive been to places back in LA where they aren't trying to rob you of your money by giving you 5:1 rice to fish ratio.   Also, one of the servers put down a half order of sunrise roll. The sunrise roll consisted  of:   Inside: spicy crab  Top: salmon, avocado, green onion Sauce: Spicy ponzu  As soon as he placed it down, he told his manager (might possibly be the owner too) and said the avocado looked a little off and brown... Manager came by, inspected the roll in front of us and told us the avocado looked bad and then said he would make us a new one. Why would you even place the sushi down in the first place if it looks bad? It made me feel more uneasy when he came over and inspected it and then told us it looked bad.   I guess.....Thanks for not letting us eat bad avocado, but no thanks for making me not want to eat it at all, even if it was a new one.  I think its safe to say I wont be returning here...",

They serve non-Sushi items too, which makes it a great place to eat!  Parking is easy (Vegas is always easy for a metropolitan city)   The price is around $25 for lunch.",

Hot tea was a little expensive, paid $7.50 for it. Still wondering why it cost that much for 1 tea. Other than that we had a great time.",

Service was great from the moment we walked in and even tho they were packed everyone was really nice.  Got seated and got drink order right away(16oz draft & glass of white wine fo da wifey).  Sashimi??? for ayce...limited to 1 order but was still ba...bomb!!  Soft shell crab??? for ayce...limited to 1 order but devoured.  Uni, amaebi, salmon belly were all awesome.  Ayce menu was huge from appetizers to sushi to sashimi to custom rolls to hand rolls which were probably the best hand rolls (spicy hamachi, spicy tuna, spicy salmon & yes i ate them all & yes i like to eat)  i've eaten at an ayce or anywhere not ayce to steaks to noodles this place has it all.  There's sumthin' for everyone!  Definitely found a new place for ayce and the reviews are spot on this time.",

    "text": "I have been to Umiya... probably about 10 times, sometimes even twice a week. For someone like my sister and I who work til 10 or 11pm, a spot that opens late into the night is perfect and apparently it's hard to find in a 24 hour city like this one.   I like Umiya for one thing and one thing only: their sushi and quality of fish. Most of the rolls that I've tried are pretty damn good. (Salmon killer; orange blossom, and although this roll was my absolute all time favorite, they must have tweaked something because it just doesn't taste the same; snow white; rattlesnake) The nigiri is composed well in terms of the ratio of rice to fish. The quality of their ingredients are fresh--with the exception of avocados perhaps being too fresh since it was nearing raw in my Monkey Brain. Oh man, with an abundance of ginger flowing with my nigiri and rolls, I'm a girl in heaven after a long day at work!  The only thing that holds me back from a 5 star rating is the service. To pick on the nitty gritty stuff, even though the servers know my sister and I their greeting is always the same. (I work in the service industry as a waitress and I can't say that I'm the best in my field but 8 out of 10 customers complement me on my service and I can say with confidence that 100% of the returning customers like to be recognized.) Whether they are busy or not, they rarely check up on my table and we always have to ask for attention. Even when they drop off our orders they never seem to ask if everything is alright and if we need something. I hope that they realize quickly that service is just as important as food for a business and regroup the way they serve customers.   Other than the service, a must try sushi joint! :)",

So I took a risk and tried this joint out..the place was very subtle and the ambience was relaxing. The server was very attentive and always came to our table at the right time we needed him. Now to the food. The nigiri was super fresh, with the right amount of rice and the appetizers were incredible. The must have are the salmon cheese stick, sizzling pork belly on a skillet, and soft shell crab just to name a few..the rolls were very delicious, great texture and flavors..oh! And you can order half rolls as well so that really got me loving this place even more! So in conclusion, I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back soon!! Peeeeace!!",

The good thing is, they have a very extensive menu, the place was well decorated and service was exceptional the night I came here.  Now the bad side, all the rolls/sushi is about 70% rice and 30% fish, fine I get that this is AYCE but the quality of the raw stuff is beyond bad, the sweet shrimp and oyster literally made me wanna puke, call me harsh but I'm from LA and my taste buds are spoiled.  The rice was hard and they give u plenty of that, I was also informed that if we left out any rice we would be charged, but after a few sushis I almost didn't give a shit cause it was so bad  My suggestions, stay away from the sushi or rolls, or anything with rice in them   For $26 per person u might as well suck it up and go to a real buffet.   If u must come, order yakitori, meat or the appetizer dishes, they're quite good.",

Like my bro doesn't like to eat rice and wanna stay in shape, he only ate fish and waitress said he couldnt do that, but my bro just wanna pay extra because he really didnt wanna eat rice. Not that he wanted wasted food. Hope they could understand that.   They have very big menu, so there are a lot of options for you. You can have 2 pieces of fresh oyster too   Soft shell crab is available,  but it has too much tempura mix on it. not that crispy.   $25 is not expensive for that many options.

All the food that my large group had was great and we are absolutely coming back for more!!!!!  I love this place!",

    "text": "Been a little while since the last sushi exploration.  This place wasn't too far from home and had great reviews, so it was a no brainer.  Appetizers: Baby Octupus Skewer, Bacon Scallop Skewer, Tuna Poke, Mushroom boy, and Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna.  All delicious. Highly suggest them all.  Mushroom boy is a deep fried mushroom filled with cream cheese and spicy tuna. No further explanation necessary.  On to the rolls.....  Philly Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Chicken Teriyaki Roll, and Vegas Lasagna.  Normally, there'd be another roll and 2-3 nigiri orders but. We tapped out. Today our bellies could not withstand AYCE as usual. But it's all good. We'll be back for sure to try everything else we missed!!  The service was very quick and on cue. Always ready to serve you and refill your drinks and take your plates.  Ambiance is laid back and cool. Love the bar and how big it is. Plenty of space for the 96 rolls you're gonna order.  They have some amazing sauces on their stuff, and just enough.  They have the news and sports on while playing top 40/EDM  Not my #1 place, but it's a great sushi option. And REALLY good for groups.",

There was absolutely nothing on the menu we didn't like besides the Uni (but we only ordered it to gross out our non sushi eating friends.  Seriously, it would be nasty anywhere).  The place was packed which is always a good sign for sushi.  The bench and table seating was very comfortable. This place is spot on across-the-board.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

I have frequented many sushi restaurants around town and nationwide and have to say this is the best I've ever been to. We were seated as soon as our party arrived. The waitress was quick to take our drink order. As she was doing this, another server came to take our food order. I really need to become better at getting the servers names. There was just such a team effort and they were all moving so fast that it was difficult to pinpoint one.  The food began to present itself and they did not miss a beat. We had a table of 9 and not one item was missed. I have a habit of letting everyone order before me as a courtesy. That tends to get my order last and by that time, everyone has already eaten. It was a pleasant surprise to receive my food so that I could enjoy it with the rest of the party. The faster we ordered, the quicker the staff brought our food. The drinks never dried up and I was pleased with the overall experience. I will certainly become a regular here if they can keep this level of greatness. I will highly recommend this place to many other friends and family. I also work in a medical office where our patients constantly ask for new places to eat. Keep up the great work and i hope to see you all soon.",

I am sure it is probably this one time and hope other times they get the rice right. But it is quite unfortunate they didn't taste the rice...they would've stopped serving it.  Service was very very slow. There were only two waiters working there and we can see that they were really trying. But the restaurant was full and they couldn't keep up.

So yeah visited this spot on like a Tuesday night I think? It was packed and there was a 15 min wait so my friends and I went to coffee bean to kill what little  time we had. One of my friends brought his coffee in with him and the staff told him no outside food allowed. Which is annoying, but understandable. My friend kind of threw a fit and the staff remained really calm and collected which I admired. My friend apologized later for his episode about the coffee, and to my amazement the staff was sweet and cordial with us throughout the night. Really groovy ambiance as well. Definitely a cool place to bring friends and I don't do AYCE sushi because that sounds horrifying and cheap to me but the sushi was actually good.",

So much to try and all came out perfect.  I felt a little guilty with the wife constantly ordering and requesting stuff, but the crew was quick and courteous. This is now our favorite AYCE sushi joint!!  Even beating out all our other favorites in the OC (CA).  Nice job guys!",

After we were finally the last party seated, I realized that the AYCE did not apply to the salmon belly, which was a daily special (which is not the case at Goyemon).   Some of the dishes I enjoyed included the daily special yuzu hamachi, sweet shrimp, grilled mackerel, uni, and the AJ (seared tuna sashimi in sauce). Some of the many missteps include the service which forgot to place our initial orders and then failed to apologize or acknowledge it, the soft-shell crab, and the unforgivable spicy tuna nachos. There was no flow to the ordering and our server even tried to take a second order without us having received the first. The only special item that Umiya has over the other sushi buffets is the soft shell crab and perhaps the rib-eye steak. But, with the multitude of AYCE sushi buffets available in Vegas, I can't see myself coming back for another disappointing meal.",

We walked in when they opened and sat down, the server said they were short staffed and that there would be an increased wait time, which I was fine with.  We ordered AYCE, only $20 at lunch.  We ordered mussels, oysters, ahi, yellow tail, albacore, a few rolls, steak, and a ton of other stuff.  The sushi was small but fresh and good. The rolls, you can order full or half rolls, were nice and really flavorful. The meat was cooked well, and the service, despite the longer wait, was really quite great.  We sat and chatted while we ate for about an hour, no rush, and our drinks were always full.  The place was packed for the duration but it still felt nice and open. Cool decor, and nice big wood tables for larger groups.  I would come back here 100%. Really had a fine time and enjoyed the heck out of my food.",

All the sushi we ordered was fantastic, I didn't have one bad roll. The oysters were really good as well! I definitely love that they had unlimited seaweed salad! At first when we got here we were worried about the 90 minute time limit but we chowed down ALOT of food in like 30 mins and got full fast so don't worry about the time limit and really enjoy each dish you order! This is a must go to place if you are in Vegas and a huge fan of sushi! I will definitely be coming back my next trip to Vegas!",

Having a party with the majority of them being visitor from Japan, I was really curious as to what they think of this place.  For about $26 per person, other than alcoholic beverages and specialty drinks, we got to order from a huge menu of all you can eat sushi rolls with certain dishes limited to a single serving per person. The caveat is that you must eat everything you order or get penalized.  Everyone was tired and quite famished so we happily ordered and consumed an assortment cold and hot sushi rolls along with certain specialties like grilled steak, uni, poke, etc.  \"the quality is okay but you really can't beat the price for the amount of sushi you get.\" one of my Japanese cohorts commented.   I agree completely.",

They were very helpful getting us started, made great suggestions, and the food came out quickly for a Saturday night. If I was strictly rating the food, I think it is a solid 4 stars. We really liked the assortment that was offered on an AYCE menu. Our favorite was the soft shell crab which is rarely seen on an AYCE menu. Another interesting item was the nacho pokie. I doubt I will be able to return to Vegas without hitting this place up several times. Our entire party was thrilled that we found this restaurant.",

We opted for their all you can eat option and the only thing worth it was the uni and amaebi. The other items were mediocre. They brought us yellow tail that was not fresh at all. I understand this is a desert but if fish looks like it's processed you shouldn't be serving it.  Although you can eat your hearts content the quality is sub par. If you don't care for quality then the AYCE is for you, but I wouldn't return even if I were from Vegas area.",

At first our server was very accommodating and then as the count down continued to the end of our AYCE endeavor she became less and less attentive.  I hate waving a person down for service as she isn't our servant but  I would like assume that in this specific industry you'd have to have customer service. I am a little person with a very big appetite who can pretty much out eat my husband any time sushi is involved and when I wanted what seemed like my 100th round of nigiri she didn't complete my order and I was starting to lose my appetite. Completely ignoring us for desserts, we had to ask another server to assist us. Super annoying. My husband is a bartender and believes in giving back he gets back... well, some people should work for the tips and not expect it like the girl who helped us. Thanks for another bad experience in yet another sushi restaurant.",

The kitchen helpers were seen cutting big chunk of salmons, put it on a cart, and from there cut into little strips. Not even a real chef is cutting these fishes carefully. Don't expect anything close of what you watch on Jiro.   I hate to say it but the best part of my ACYE was the appetizers. And that's sad because it's a sushi restaurant.   Their rolls were just ok. Nothing glorious.  There are definitely better sushi places in Vegas.   Probably will not come back here.",

I was wondering why there were couples seated at tables for at least 4 people and even one guy had a table to himself and they wanted to put us with a group of strangers. I'd understand if the place were packed and that was the only place to sit was with another party and both parties would be fine sitting together. It was just so bewildering why they'd even have us sit with strangers when there are tables open.   I love the food here and their prices are really good but just having them try to make us sit with others is just so mind boggling.",

    "text": "Like $27.00 + tax for AYCE.  Tips: 1. Go with at least 3 friends if you can. That way you can share food as a table instead of trying to eat something all by yourself. You can try more this way. 2. Don't order rolls that have 8000 pounds of rice! You'll be full super fast like the rookies at our table. 3. Order everything on the limited menu/special. Make sure you order those things as they are limited for a reason!  4. Eat the fried shrimp heads!   Stay away from some things like: 1. The iced tea. It tastes weird and like it's from fountain concentrate, not fresh. 2. The fried calamari. It's fish cake-based, not actually squid. 3. Fried banana ice cream. Not tasty. 4. Green tea mochi. Tastes cheap and actually floral. 5. Ramen. It's a throw away of stomach space and not exactly a ramen shop.  No reservations unless it's a party of 6 or more, so time your trip appropriately. You get 90 minutes to eat. We were initially worried it would take forever to get food, but our server was the absolute shit! We slammed him with the world's largest order and then told him \"we trust your judgment\" about anything he wanted to add. Our food came out so fast at 8PM on a Sunday right after we ordered.   If you want the most chill, AWESOME server, get the guy with sideswept hair. I want to say he's Filipino or SE Asian. (Bro, I'm so sorry if you're not, but everyone there is Asian, so I don't know how to describe you. You deserve big money, and I hope people throw tons of it at you.)  Come eat when you are HUNGRY, and bring fun friends that bring good vibes.",

It's really a rhetorical question because the obvious answer is, \"No, I've never eaten real sushi prepared by someone who had to work to learn his craft.\" Otherwise, you'd realize that the shit they serve here in NO WAY approximates real sushi, let alone real food. Four stars for the crap they plated for us? You must be joking. The food here isn't even worthy of a single star.",

The only thing I was actually worried about was how busy it might be. Every review pointed out to longer wait times and unusually seating arrangements which means I have to wait an eternity for my food..and we're just so freaking hungry.  I did pick up on a tip to reserve on open table. Turns out we didn't have to worry 11:30p we rolled in, had a nice table to ourselves. Curtis was our server nice dude, he offered a late night special for $20.95 lunch special we declined we wanted the whole shebang.   Food: Awesome. The rice to sushi ratio was perfect. No heavy hands on sauce. Uni was yummy, soft shell crabs and oysters - delicious (all 1 per order). The Tuna Naruto roll bomb option for the no rice choice. Honestly we tried many nigiri and specialty rolls none disappointed. ****TIP: Order half orders if you can, theres sooo many to try***  Location: Ok. Considering it's proximity to The Palms and The Apothecary this area is aiiighht. There all sorts of characters walking around this plaza in the day but late a night it was just fine. Plenty of parking too.  Service: 5 star. They were so quick bringing out all the apps, sushi!! They replenished drinks often, and removed plates promptly. Curtis was polite, recommending popular options as well as his. Never far so we didn't have try to look for him if we needed anything..damn good at his job.  I think we got to experience the best of this place definitely because of the late hour. Setting the bar pretty high for a late night sushi option or perhaps in general.",

We came here for lunch but immediately wished we could have visited during dinner instead. A lot of their menu items were only available during dinner.   Despite not having the full menu available to us, everything was fresh and delicious! I'm still thinking about their salmon belly!! Yumm!!! It's not on their sushi menu but our waitress recommended it to us and let us know it was part of all you can eat! Amazing! It was so buttery and fatty... It's making my mouth water just writing about it! The highlights for me was their softshell crab appetizer and their sizzling pork belly appetizer. Unfortunately, the softshell carb was limit 1 order per person. Service was fast and friendly. Parking was not a problem since they have their own parking lot.   The only downside was you couldn't upgrade to their dinner menu for lunch and limited servings for certain items. Other than that, we would definitely visit again but for dinner!!",

    "text": "Even we had a hefty brunch, late-night sushi run is always fun.   To end our night we want to have some sushi and we found out that this place close around 2 am in the morning, well that is a plus to us, so there we go.  This place is a combination of AYCE and regular menu, at that time they actually have a promo going on called \"reverse happy hours\" for $20.99 from 11-2am (double check the price and time, but I think it's around that price and time) you can get AYCE. Well, we arrived around 10:30 pm so we just got the normal AYCE price still a decent price.  So, the AYCE menu consists of a lot of things, you can get soup, appetizer, and of course the sushi, wait, I think you can also get dessert, well, the AYCE menu is huge and offers a lot of food so that's a plus.   What I like about this place is that the sushi is made to order, which means the rice is still fresh and not stale, and personally, I think that's way better than letting the made-sushi sitting for hours and no one will eat it, at least this time you can order what you really want, the will make it and you will eat, simple and less wasteful.   All in all, this is a great AYCE Sushi place, opens late, made to order, huge sushi selection and AYCE menu.",

    "text": "Got the chance to come back to visit Las Vegas so you know I had to come back to eat at UMIYA!!!  My party came at a less busy time so all our food came out QUICK. Mostly ordered the limited rolls that were offer during dinner time and a few of the fried appetizers. Customer service was GREAT. Our table mostly consisted of nigiri( salmon,salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, konch, yuzu yellowtail). We also got the tuna carpaccio, garlic edamame (we asked for non spicy and they were able to accommodate), fried shrimp shumai, soft shell crab appetizer, marinated pork belly, seafood ceviche was pretty good! Oyster was delicious! The food quality here is really top notch for an AYCE sushi joint. I'm so glad the service and food was just as great as the first time I've came here alittle over a year ago. Don't forget, there's unlimited ice cream!( pistachio almond, vanilla, green tea) and limited mochi per person!! Keep up the great food and service!",

    "text": "From time to time, I have this urge to go to AYCE sushi...and Umiya Sushi is my go to place. You can make a reservation by calling or making it through Open Table.  What I love about Umiya:  - Daily special items, found on the boards on the wall, are quite good and premium - You have the option to do a la cart...but why would you? - The ratio of fish and rice is spot on, with the fish hovering over a small ball of rice. - Quick and friendly service...before you put the last piece in your mouth, one of the staff members will come over and take your next order. - Because you can make a reservation in advance, you don't really have to wait for the table to open! Just be sure to make it in advance. - There are a lot of non-sushi items on the AYCE menu including noodles, tempura, chicken, and beef options...there are enough that someone that doesn't enjoy sushi could come in for a good meal, or join a party of AYCE sushi eaters and not feel left out.  - Most of all, the freshness of the fish and how tasty all the cooked items are. The quality at Umiya is certainly better than you will find at most AYCE spots in town.  You can have the dinner AYCE option during lunchtime...I often choose to do so, since you get more options to pick from, such as Ama Ebi and Uni.  So if your AYCE sushi spot isn't up to the standard, or doesn't take reservations, then make a reservation at Umiya Sushi and come on in.   -2019 review #5-",

    "text": "Umiya is my absolute favorite place to get sushi. Believe me, I put up quite an argument when my friends or family suggest going to any other sushi place. The sushi is amazing but my main love of Umiya comes from their massive selection of non sushi items in the ayce menu. I know that sounds insane, who goes to sushi restaurant to not eat sushi? But of course I eat it, I just like the option of having more variety on the side.   Occupancy is unpredictable at best so always set a reservation just to spare yourself a 30 minute wait, more so if you are arriving with a group. Service is quick both in the form of getting a waiters attention and getting your food which is great considering how busy this place can get.  I always order their udon soup and recommend you do the same. Their nabeyaki is full of veggies, tempura, kamboko  and even an egg. This comes as a sharp contrast to the udon at other ayce sushis where I'm usually just served a small bowl with noodles and broth.  Onto the rest of the menu, I've ordered everything they serve from chicken to sea urchin and I could not be anymore impressed by the quality and freshness of their meats. Even the oysters are incredibly fresh which is something I'm very partial about. 10/10 Umiya sets the gold standard for me.",

    "text": "Umiya is definitely in my top 5 ayce sushi spots here in Vegas! The quality of the sushi is great and I especially appreciate how they include just the right amount of rice in their nigiri's. I've been to sushi spots where the ratio of rice to fish is just too much. My go-to order at umiya is the salmon belly nigiri and spicy tuna nigiri. Go-to rolls include the orange blossom and the Snow White rolls! We also get the Vegas lasagna roll when we're craving it- it is on the heavier side as far as filling you up, so we try to save that for last. Overall, every time I come in the staff is very polite and service is pretty quick too. Definitely recommend if umiya if you're visiting Vegas and looking for a great sushi spot! The weekends get pretty busy, so I would keep that in mind as well.",

You can even order half rolls so you can squeeze in more variety. They best was actually the marinated beef and chicken yakitori. The orange blossom roll was probably my favorite sushi part because of the tangy flavor of the sauce with the salmon. Coffee mochi ice cream was a great finish to the meal. Though I had an upset stomach afterwards, I did have a good meal while I was eating and will probably give them another shot before I finalize judgment.",

    "text": "Ok.... As a business owner I'm telling you up front to take my review with a grain of salt.  Here's why.    #1  It's a Wednesday that I'm writing this review.  I know many sushi restaurants don't carry their freshest stuff on Wednesday's but that it comes in for the weekends.  I get it.  #2 After coming here did I find out it's an \"all you can eat\" kinda place.  With that as a preamble here's my review.  At roughly $26 per person for all you can eat ... I mean ... what do you expect really?  Top shelf uni?  Top shelf ... anything?  In any case when I see 4.5 stars on Yelp where I come from (New York) I expect buttery toro, perfect texture uni ... so creamy, baby yellowtail, king salmon, kunomoto oyster, live scallop ... if  you've ever eaten top shelf YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  Apparently 4.5 stars in Las Vegas is NOT THE SAME as 4.5 stars in New York.  THAT'S FOR SURE.  Did they have uni? Yes. It was so mushy though and two of the four pieces were various colors ... :-/    The ikura (salmon roe) was rubbery. The True test of fresh salmon roe is that it POPS in your mouth.  That is 4.5-5 star quality.  Is it just me or do people in Las Vegas don't know great sushi?  Did I catch them on a bad night?  IDK... I've been here to Raku twice and both times during the week it was off the hook and met my expectations.  To it's credit ... the staff was very helpful and the service was FAST.  I love fast service.   With regards to the food ... large quantities at cheap prices always seems good but if you've ever really experienced top shelf sushi/sashimi and you're looking for that here... uh uh.  You've seen what I said regarding the uni and ikura.  To it's credit the yellow tail was very good as were the two special rolls we ordered which were the salmon everything kinda roll and the yellow tail lover roll.  See ... when you go to any sushi restaurant you'll always find the best \"flavor\" in special rolls where they can cover up the freshness that you would otherwise find in their sashimi dishes and when you order the \"all you can eat\" you are prevented from ordering sashimi.  :-/  THAT'S BECAUSE they want you to fill up on the rice.  As a business owner I get it ... it makes sense. ;)  But if you are a True sushi connoisseur ... homey don't play dat. By the waiters suggestion I did order the oysters and to their credit they were really good but were they \"great\"?  Sorry.  I like my oysters ice cold.  Call me a sushi snob but I like my raw fish fresh and cold.  So ... my recommendations for a person coming here.  If your sushi habits are to have all you can eat on a budget ... this is the place for you. $26 per person... you can't beat it.  If however you are a sushi snob like I am and you've been spoiled with the likes of top shelf raw fish ... don't bother coming here while in Vegas.  Face the facts ... you've going to have to bite the bullet and check out some of the higher end places.    I'm willing to come back here on a weekend and see if I'm wrong but ... we'll see. Till then ... no more than 2 stars.",

They seemed a little under staffed because when we went it was a little busy but it felt like the two servers that were there were constantly running around in circles and it was kind of hard to track them down at some points. They were very friendly though! As for the food, the fish was okay. It didn't taste very fresh and I tasted a sort of sweetness to the fish that threw me off, but it wasn't terrible, just not what I was expecting. Everything tasted sweet to me, especially the spicy tuna dishes that we ordered. Great price for all you can eat sushi though and lots of roll, appetizer, and nigiri choices which was nice! I'd give this place another shot if I came back to town.",

As with most of the AYCE sushi places I've tried, the chefs and staff are great here.  What makes it stand out is the flavors of their rolls and sauces to go with the rolls.  The fish is fresh and flavorful.  Umiya is priced right, in a great location, near the Palms, Rio, and Gold Coast, and when I'm in that area, craving sushi, this place is sure to be on the top of my list.    One of the best parts about Umiya is the selection.  They have a wide variety of rolls, and so many delicious options.  If only I had known about it sooner, when I used to stay at the Rio.  The price is typical of most of the other AYCE sushi places, and it's a great choice for tourists and locals alike.  I still have my favorite on the other side of town, but I'll be back here.",

This place reminds me of dollar tree or any discount store.  The selection of items is overwhelming, but there's nothing really of quality or substance.    The rolls doused with mayo were fine; however, if you are used to fresh nigiri, this is definitely not the place for you.  There are many ayce sushi bars with much fresher fish.  I understand this is not fine dining, but at this price point, there are many other places to choose from.",

The place was pretty empty on the Friday night we went...not a good sign.  The rolls we got were good: Sunrise, Sunset, Salsa Dancing and Snow White.  I also liked the pork belly, ribeye steak and the fact that they have skewers as part of AYCE.  What I didn't like and have had better in other sushi restaurants: lobster crunch, super white tuna and green tea ice cream.  The langoustine on the lobster crunch tasted too briny.  The super white tuna was rubbery and didn't taste fresh.  The green tea ice cream tasted like medicine.  It reminded me of the time I ate green tea ice cream I had in the freezer for a year.  This place is good for cooked food.  Sushi...not so much.",

The server was at our table at regular intervals to check on us and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. She also made suggestions based on our tastes that were spot on.  The menu is incredible. Appetizers, salads, soups, ramen and steak (yes, steak) were all available on the $26 AYCE menu as well as sushi and nigiri. The food is high quality, fresh, and the chefs were willing to tweak their rolls according to my very picky (I prefer selective) taste.  We were there kind of later (12am-1:30am--they close at 2am) but not once felt a rush to leave or pressure from the staff.  The Umiya experience was amazing and I'll definitely be back. This is probably my new favorite sushi joint.",

I was wrong.  Almost everyone got AYCE. After the waiter took our order, we waited for a long time for our food to come out. Besides our table, there were about 4 other small tables. Not so busy. One of us ordered Chicken Katsu, he waited 40 minutes for it to come out while the rest of us ate our sushi. It should not take that long for them to make chicken katsu unless they had to hunt a chicken down, skin it, THEN cook it. The service was terrible, the quality of the sushi seemed like they pre cut it. I tend to stay within my usual ayce sushi places but since this was for my friend's 20th birthday we all tried it out.  The only reason why I'm not giving it a 1 star because of this one waiter, unfortunately I didn't get his name but he looked Korean and he had a cross necklace. He was the only waiter who provided us with good service. The other workers had attitude and one female worker with red hair accidentally hit my friend on the head with a plate and he did not get an apology. This place is NOT worth going to.",

    "text": "What separates Umiya from other sushi/Japanese restaurants is that their \"All You Can Eat\" menu includes choices like (chicken or beef) yakisoba, udon, and small steaks if you'd like to take a break from your sushi marathon. I highly recommend the \"Seared Tuna Sashimi in AJ Sauce\" appetizer. You're only allowed one order per person for dinner, and I can taste why!   Desserts are included in AYCE, and the plum wine-flavored ice cream is a MUST. Totally different taste from what it sounds like.   The casual/cool atmosphere is great for families and parties, and it's convenient location by the strip is perfect before a night out on the town.",

The only thing i did not like was that the servers were a little pushy about us ordering fast and would stand there until we did.  Overall it was a good place to get sushi.  The place was not packed at all when we went (around 11 pm) so we got to eat as soon as we got there unlike the 40 minute to an hour wait at sushi kaya.",

Giving it 5 stars is a bit nice of me, and it is to be honest close to 4 stars. But I'll go with the 5 stars for now :)  I would recommend going for the \"all you can eat\" option. Especially if you are at least two persons since you then can order different things and share (if you don't like sharing you suck). For me sharing the different rolls and talk about them as we eat is a good experience. I will recommend starting with a Screaming O(rgasme) and some Edamame. Of the rolls there are several good ones: Orange Blossom, Sexy Roll and the Baked Salmon Roll are among my favorites. And you have to get the tuna pieces in AJ sauce. They do have things that are not typical Japanese on their menu. I wouldn't recommend those to be honest. This is a sushi restaurant!  I will keep coming back here for sure!",

Upon walking in we were greeted in a prompt manner and sat immediately.  Our server asked if we wanted the all you can eat option and neither of us girls wanted to grub too crazy so we just ordered a few rolls each. As a starter we got a miso soup and patiently waited for 2 rolls. One of them was a dragon roll and the other was a salmon salsa roll.  15 minutes later we finally got our rolls. And just as I was getting ready to get my chopsticks ready, I noticed something a little off about my roll. I took a closer look and guess what was in my roll? A hair. I immediately called for my server and told him there was something in my roll and that it looked like a hair. He then took my plate, took a quick look at it and said that he didn't notice anything. I then pointed out the hair that was protruding out of the baked eel dragon roll and he said... oh I see it now and quickly took it away. He then said he was making me a new one but by that time I was pretty over it.  And didn't want one to replace it all. I ate my other salmon salsa roll thing and when I finished they had brought me a new eel roll but I asked them to take it back because I was kind of grossed out.  Our server seemed sorry about it.  And he comped us a mochi that we had ordered towards the end of the meal. However, I was really thrown off. He also gave us a card that gives us 2 free drinks with the purchase of $35 or more but I highly doubt I would ever go back. With so many delicious options in vegas, this is a spot that is very forgettable.",

We had a whole table to ourselves and it wasn't very busy. We probably arrived there around 8pm.   We ordered a couple things at first so we can all share, but as we went along, we ordered more, which was perfect.  The different sushi rolls were really cool and really good! I got the Snow White, spicy octopus (2 pieces) and a number of others I can't remember. but Snow White was realllly good. The First Kiss sushi roll was also delicious.    I got the passion fruit saketini. It was good but it was really sweet and you can barely taste the alcohol. I would recommend getting the lychee saketini or ordering the buy 2 get 1 free beer (Asee, I think it was).   The udon noodle soup was a little sweet as well. But the soup was good to have with all the sushi. Jalepeno poppers was amazing and it wasn't spicy.   We also got the Japanese Lasagna sushi. it was odd, there was cheese, sauces, and panko (i think it was) on top. A whole mixture of flavors. it was kinda odd, weird, okay tasting. I'd say try it..but don't let it get too cold or else you won't want to finish it.   Unfortunately, they don't have sashimi. :(  I really wanted that with the spicy red pepper sauce (choh goh chi jang).  But they do have   I gave it 3 stars because they charge you for whatever is not finished.  :(  lol but the servers were really nice, really friendly and helpful.",

The waiters/waitresses were on point with the water and checking back with you.  Went with a group and did the AYCE. The menu was really large and had a pretty good variety - even for non-sushi eaters like myself. My other half loves sushi so he was all over it. In his opinion the sushi was on point.  $26 is well worth it since you can order a variety of things.",

    "text": "Walking in, the decor is appealing, lighting was the perfect not too dark and they sat us in tables off to the side kind of intimate little areas, leaving their long tables for large groups. BTW, I think this would be a good place if you have a big group of friends or family because of their farm tables.  Started w/ house salad- loved it. It had a great sweet/salty, & tangy dressing. Very good portion of fresh mixed greens, juicy tomatoes and avocado slices. Loved the sticks of marinated cucumber throughout.  On to some Grilled Skewers-  -baby tako (spicy, yummy BBQ like sauce) too bad it was tough, took a lot of chewing :/ -grilled chicken, had some soggy skin that didn't crisp up, unappetizing -bacon wrapped scallops were great, (crispy, sweet, succulent) of the ones we tried, I would have tripled our scallop order and scrapped the rest. Good to know.  Creamy shrimp comes with a little ketchup dipper and side house salad. Good concept with shrimp wrapped in wonton wrappers & cream cheese, then fried. Unfortunately, it seemed they used pre-cooked shrimp, drying out the shrimp; even cream cheese cannot save rubbery and tough shrimp. Dish has potential, though, if only the shrimp were succulent! I also think the ketchup was a weird sauce choice-  maybe a citrus ginger or one of the sushi sauces. Just not the ketchup.  On to sushi, we went basic. Sometimes when I'm not sure about a restaurant, I start with a spicy tuna roll. Gotta be able to make a great spicy tuna before earning my trust in rolls! Theirs was decent but low on the spice factor IMO and they had decent Philly California roll, as well. A nice bowl of tempura ice cream and that was it folks, we were stuffed. I'll say service was a rollercoaster as bigger groups came in and received more attention, understandable, but still we were sometimes hanging out there in space and sometimes our servers (there were 2 tag-teaming) were on top of it. That's kind of how our food went, too, solid 2.5 overall.",

The standard garlic tuna is still good and my favorite roll is the orange blossom . I also have to get the spicy octopus nigiri which is tasty .   Overall they need a revamp and a refresh . They also need to get new physical menus for they are pretty dirty and falling apart .   I wish for the day where they were like they used to be .",

It is rare that you will see an AYCE place lets you order shucked oysters, pork belly dishes, rib eye, and ramen/udon in addition to everything else on the menu.  They also have a large selection of beers but their house sake is tasty! oh not to forget they also had no rice sushi rolls wrapped in cucumber which I love.  Some of the items on an ayce sushi list are sweet shrimp, white tuna!! oysters, ramen, Kalbi, and pork belly dishes. Some of the desserts are Mochi, ice cream, banana splits, all included in the ayce.   My favorite are Salmon Skin, tempura shrimp, soft shell crab and Snow white rolls and the sushi wrapped with cucumber instead of rice, I forgot the name.   The staff were nice and the service was great and the food was so fresh and delicious!!  one of my favorite place to add to my list, we will definitely be back.",

I'm not so crazy about the sushi but I love how we can get a taste of what's in their menu.  The portions given are perfect and me and my friend love their cute poke salad. Very well marinated and with a cute side of seaweed salad it's the one thing she craves about and she doesn't even like raw sushi.   Customer service was quick and attentive. The atmosphere was a dim setting reminds me of a sports bar. This place does get crowded in the evening.  If you're looking for a place for all you can eat with a large selection of appetizers (what I mostly order), yakatoris, ramen/udon, Japanese entree dishes, nigiri, or sushi. This is your place. I love how it's different from a buffet. You get a variety of Japanese cuisine all made to order.  However, their are certain items in the menu that are only one order per person. And it's usually my favorites. I can understand why it's only allowed 1 per order.",

This place had an overall of 4 stars so we decided to go here.   This is an AYCE Sushi place, you order off the menu and some items like UNI can only be ordered once per person. Sad face. They have daily special items that you can also order in the AYCE. Other then that, I thought most of the items were pretty good. The last items we ordered were crab and I didn't like it, took a bite gave it to my friend. He didn't like it but finished it. (The best thing about dining with my friend is he'll finish everything.. yay to me for sampling everything. Makes me enjoy eating out way more.)   If you order tea they charge you for it but comes in this clear mug with their logo. The service here is wonderful. They communicate with each other over mics/walkie talkies and if one checked on a table stating they are good on water, they will announce that so you don't get checked again and again with repeating yourself. Good job on that!",

Place had a modern, cozy feel with wooden decor that was like benches and not seats. We were told an hour wait, but got in at 30 in a 6 seater when we had 7. They made it work for us and we got to eating. Everything came quickly even though it was packed house, and service was great. The sushi quality was a B+ with most things fresh for an AYCE. There was  one HUGE red flag in the sushi. The Uni (sea urchin) was complete garbage. It was fishy, smelled like it was old and tasted awful. They limit certain things to one per person, and the uni was one of them. But it was thw worst thing I have ever tasted. It was the only reason this place did not get a 5 star. Other tha  that, great place.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas for one night and searched for sushi and decided on this place based off my fellow Yelpers giving it a high rating.  This place is a very good value for $25.99 AYCE dinner- it includes an extensive menu of sushi, sides, small entrees, rolls and even dessert!  Drinks are not included.  Some items are only available during dinner and limited to one order per person.   I really enjoyed the Orange Blossom roll, King of the Ocean roll, Sashimi with AJ sauce, poke salad, Naruto roll (cucumber wrapped and limited to one order per person), yellowtail collar, and salmon belly sushi.  Those were my favs.  They also had a special board for items not offered in their regular menu.  I was concerned about their previous C rating that a yelper left and it is now an A rating.  We asked.  I used to run a sushi business with my mom and brother and I'm very particular about sushi restaurants having no less than an A rating because food temperature and cleanliness is paramount to serving food safely.   Service was very quick on an early Friday night- orders taken very often, friendly servers, refills given frequently because my husband is a thirsty camel that needs upwards of 4-5 refills on average.    Dishes were cleared away quickly.  Food came out quickly as well.  Plenty of parking.  They text you when you're table is ready.  Half orders are rolls are available.",

If you need a quick, affordable, tasty meal this is a great spot. The ambiance is also very nice and it's clean.   I wasn't crazy about the rolls I got. Nothing wrong with the quality or anything like that, just my taste preferences. The caterpillar was too sweet for my liking and the Tokyo roll was really big in size which made it hard to manage and it was not super flavorful. The miso soup was great and so was the seaweed salad. We also got green tea and great green tea ice cream and both were delicious.   Overall this place is affordable and yummy and I would recommend trying it out if you're sick of the strip. I didn't give them the full 5 stars because as a sushi place I feel like you really have to bring it on the rolls and your taste buds should be dancing and leaping with joy, this place is good but not at that level.",

    "text": "In my review I'm going to compare Umiya Sushi to other AYCE sushi I've had instead of to sushi restaurants in general. It's All You Can Eat ($20 for lunch and $25 for dinner) , so I was going here with the expectation that the sushi was going to be OK and that I was determined to get my money's worth of food (AKA eat as much raw fish as I physically can). I was SO pleasantly surprised at the selection, service, and the quality of some of the menu items!   I've only eaten AYCE sushi in California (mostly LA) and I think that Umiya is some of the best AYCE sushi I've ever had. Of course, the sushi is not going to be as quality as an omakase or a restaurant that sells individual rolls (and it's unfair to compare AYCE quality to that). But I think it's pretty darn good for what it is and fresh for AYCE. Some of the rolls I ordered came with really generous slices of fish and minimal rice.  What really impresses me is the extensive menu! It's huge and covers everything from fried appetizers to unique rolls to desserts (yes, the dessert is AYCE too). Some of the pricier items are \"one serving per person\" and are definitely worth ordering. There are also daily specials on the board that you can order from.   A few delicious items that I recommend:  Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar) Fried soft shell crab Sea urchin (Uni) nigiri Salmon belly nigiri Sweet shrimp (Amaebi) nigiri Fried shrimp head Baby octopus skewer Spicy rice cake skewers (fried) Rice-free (cucumber wrapped) rolls  Tempura green tea ice cream Mochi ice cream  There was also stuff I didn't get to try like ramen, katsu, gyoza, agedashi tofu, and various yakitori (will probably try these next time). You usually don't see items of this quality on a typical AYCE sushi menu. I will say that some of the fried items and rolls were hit or miss but, hey, it's AYCE so if you don't like it just order something else!   One more huge pro to this place: it's super well staffed! There were about six tables in the restaurant at 4PM and there were six sushi chefs making sushi. All our food came out really fast. Also, I love that there was no limit to how much you can order at a time and the amount of orders you can put in ( I see these restrictions a lot at other AYCE sushi! )",

    "text": "It's always funny to say that my favorite sushi place is in the dessert but this is favorite AYCE sushi buffet. Every time I visit Vegas I always try to make an attempt to come here. I'd recommend making a reservation through Open Table or calling in. We did this and got seated pretty much right when we got there. The whole menu minus the drinks are AYCE. There are items on the menu that you can only get ONE of like the sweet shrimp and the sea urchin. Take a quick look at the menu and start ordering away. I'd normally order an appetizer and go straight for the nigiri. I'll follow up with some grilled items then a soup like udon and miso. The food comes out really quick, well within 5 minutes of ordering and that's one thing I love about this place.   There will be times when they forget an item or two or maybe our order just went to a different table. Mistakenly this past time we got an order of the salmon belly that wasn't even on the menu. Quite the serendipity. It was actually on the special's menu that's on small blacklight board at the back of the restaurant. Thanks to this mistake we got to try some delicious specials. Always a pleasure coming here and I always leave filling I got my money's worth. Great value for about $30 after tax and tip.  SERVICE: It's great, the servers comes by every 5ish minutes to take order or take our empty plates away.  PARKING: No problem there. Plenty of space in the parking lot.",

    "text": "I'm very pleased that Yelp suggested that this was one of the best sushi restaurant off the strip. I was a little hesitant because it's AYCE but it has the option for ala carte. The waitress was super friendly and the team of them worked very well together, helping each other with drink refills, cleaning off after each serving and the service was prompt and efficient. She explained that the AYCE menu is very similar but the portions are usually smaller so you're able to try more variety and that was perfect for me.   I usually will order 2 rolls and that alone would cost more than the AYCE price of $25 (dinner). Desserts are included but not drinks. In Chicago we have 1 AYCE but they give so much rice and they don't offer premium nigiri and offer mainly rolls.   Here they offered over a dozen appetizers and thankfully the portions were just the right amount so I was able to enjoy 2 maki rolls (1/2 orders), Miso soup, agadashi tofu, and nigiri. The uni and sweet shrimp were limited to one order but I couldn't eat more anyway. The yellowtail, unagi, sweet shrimp and uni were so good and fresh!   My husband enjoyed his Japanese steak, shrimp tempura, Kiss of Fire, Fresh and Easy roll (which had no rice), and Rattlesnake roll.   The bathroom was tidy and clean.   I'm definitely giving this place a 5 stars rating not only for the great service but fresh and tasty AYCE deliciousness.",

I didn't have time to do my research because I didn't know they have sushi Ayce for only $25 diner and $20 lunch. If I knew beforehand, we would have opted for this deal instead. Oh well, I'll make sure to have that option on my next visit.   We were greeted as soon as we came in and was seated in one of the booths. I liked that you can eat privately in these booths. We were served with water instantly and handed with the menu.  We ordered salmon sashimi, vegetable tempura, rainbow roll, California roll and miso ramen. Everything was great. I liked that they were all fresh, a must when it comes to sushi and rolls. However, ramen was just okay. I had better ramen somewhere else.  Service wasn't the friendliest because the server was a bit shy but she tried her best in taking care of us. She was attentive and constantly checked on us.",

But, the hostess did place in the wrong phone number so they could not contact us.  We had to double check with them .  So we ended up waiting longer.   We then sat down on a very big table which we did like.  The service here is not the best.... I felt like every encounter we had, the person was annoyed.  We also decided to order alcohol.  I particularly ordered pineapple juice and vodka.... It tasted like rotten pineapples!! I thought I was going crazy.  I made everyone on my table take a sip to confirm.  Do they not double check their products?! It was disgusting.  I ended up getting a cranberry juice and vodka but It was just watered down.    The wait for the food was about 10-15 min which is not that bad for ayce.  The hard part was trying to order again.  I felt that servers never really knew when to come and check up on the table.    After experiencing what I did last night,  I don't think I'd like to come back.  The service and the lack of quality justified It all.

They make the food fresh and tasty flavors from their kitchen. I ate here many times here and it's VERY DELICIOUS!  They have many different variety of foods from appetizers, sushi, chicken, beef, desserts, soups, seafood, and much more. This place also have sodas, teas, beer, and wine. Just a heads up, some of the portions are limited to one per person.   So far, I tried:  Appetizers - Baked Mussels (MY FAVORITE!) (Now limited one entree per person) - Salmon Cheesesticks - Jalapeno Poppers  Salad - Seaweed Salad  Tempura - Large Shrimp Tempura  Entree - Teriyaki Chicken - Chicken Katsu - BBQ Short Ribs - Fresh Oysters - Fried Oysters - Fried Squid  Noodles - Tempura Udon  Sushi - Smoked Salmon Sashimi - Spicy Tuna Roll - Spicy Salmon Roll - King of Ocean Roll - Fire Cracker Roll - Sexy Roll - Rainbow Roll - Salsa Dancing Roll - Sunrise Roll - Baked Salmon Roll - Dragon Roll - Rattle Snake Roll - Creamy Eel Roll - Orange Blossom Roll - Energy Roll - Banana Roll - Snow White Roll - Shrimp Tempura Roll - Flamingo Roll - Snow Corn Roll - First Kiss Sushi - Salmon Lovers Roll  Dessert - Ice Cream   - Vanilla   - Green Tea - Banana Split - Vanilla Tempura Ice Cream (Delicious!) - Mochi Ice Cream   - Green Tea   - Coffee   - Red Bean   - Strawberry  If you are around this area, I recommend to try this restaurant! This place may be pricey but worth to try! Don't go to the Japanese buffet around the corner, its the almost the same price as here as well. $26 for each adult isn't bad, as long as you come in and you have a large appetite, it's worth the price. They also have price per item menu if your not that hungry or if you want to take out.   All the food here are made to order and much fresher here also. All the staff here are friendlier and making sure if your happy. They also get your orders correctly! I recommend to make reservation because this place is very busy and walk ins takes a long time to get in. They also have a text message system to let you know when your table is ready as well!",

There's a large variety of items to choose from: from soup and salad to noodles, entrees, sushi and dessert. For $25 you really get the bang for your buck. Some items are limited to one serving per person but that's also a good thing cause you get to try more of the other items on the menu.",

The decor of the restaurant was very modernized and I really liked the ambience the place brought. What really brought my rating down for me was the service. Our waitress came and got our order the first time and came and checked on us once after, but after that she didn't check on us again for a while. The table next to us who sat down 20 minutes after us was getting their food ordered faster than us. I just didn't really feel welcomed.  Most of the sushi was very good and the amaebi, uni, mussels and tempura udon were on point. The rolls we ordered were also very good. The problem I had with the food was the salmon. I love salmon and this was a huge disappointment for me. It was really fishy tasting, and it was a little warm. It was definitely an area of concern.  It wasn't too busy tonight, so hopefully they can be more attentive with their customers, but I am willing to try it again as most of the sushi except the salmon was very good, maybe sit at the bar next time.",

It is definitely like a bar typed sushi restaurant since there are TVs showing sports and the ambiance being dark and mind of loud as if you were in a bar. The seating is also on benches with the tables and the bar having bar seats. But this is not a bad thing.  As for the food I certainly ate more than what I had to pay for the all you can eat. The fish was cut well (bigger portion compared to rice) and seemed fresh. The cooked food was also very good. I enjoyed eating everything I ate from various nigiris to tempura to the marinated meat to the ice cream. The food was just amazing.  Not only was the food excellent but the service was amazing. They made sure our waters were always full, whenever we looked at the menu they came by asking If we wanted more, they took empty plates immediately, and served our food very quickly. It was honestly the fastest service I've had at any all you can eat place and usually they take their time since they always have a time limit. I noticed that all of the servers and waiters helped each other which made things smoother and satisfied customers.   Overall I cant say enough good things about this restaurant. I will definitely be back and bring my friends and family. Keep up the good work.",

So, if there are 2 people in your group. You may be seated with other people. How fun is that. I did the all up can eat which is quite reasonable for $20.95 before 3pm and $25.95 from 3p-closing 2am. The marinated Pork Belly is quite flavorful (3 pieces). Order the baked mussels when you get there, because it takes a lil bit longer to cook. I also ordered Salmon Collar which is on the dinner menu...yummy!!! 1 piece is perfect for 1 person. I topped with a tempura green tea ice cream. Overall a good place to meet for sushi off and by the strip.",

Good quality nigiri and tasty rolls. Not 5stars cause the bar was a little unorganized in the back but I'm picky working in F&B industry. Will return with joy  Shootout to the Umiya team",

I came here with my family on a Saturday night a little over an hour before they closed. We got menus and started going through it then a server (male) came over to our table and said \"what would you guys want to drink, I'm only taking drinks order!\". At that moment I felt we were being rushed and probably had pissed off that server for the fact that we came in 1 hour before they were closed. An hour is actually plenty of time to give your customers a full service dining experience without rushing them, I know because I'm a long time server myself at a full service sushi restaurant. I get it when customers come in late but thats a con when you work in this restaurant industry. After that server took our drinks order a new server came and took care of us the rest of the time. Overall, food was definitely better than all the AYCE sushi joints i've been too. But service left me feeling like I was not welcomed. I would probably recommend not coming here 1.5 hours before they close.",

This is key when wasting food, including rice, will cost you. Still thought it was worth it. $26 per person for all you can eat sushi sounded scary. I mean 2 specialty rolls cost that. However the quality was actually good. I'd recommend this place.",

Upon arriving, our table was ready for us and we were able to start ordering as soon as we sat down (we were all very hungry from our flight and a day of walking the strip waiting for our rooms to be ready).  If you're coming here to expect a sushi meal from Tsukiji Fish Market, you'll definitely be disappointed.. but if you come expecting to be full, have decent AYCE sushi for an amazing price.. you'll be very pleased.  All of us left with full and satisfied stomachs.  You can't beat it for the price and I love that they take reservations.  I will definitely be back when traveling back to Vegas.  **Get the oysters & the uni.. and take your friend's order if they pass on it ;)",

The host was extremely rude when I told him I had a pick up order and told me in an accusing tone that he did not see the order (how is that my fault??). He then demanded angrily that I show him the order confirmation, which I did (which somehow annoyed him more). They then found the order and prepared it. Got back to the hotel and was super disappointed with the sushi. Fish did not taste fresh at all, and all my rolls were overpowered by imitation crab. I did not end up finishing my food because I disliked it so much. Only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because I did not get food poisoning, so kudos for that!",

    "text": "I really don't get all of the great reviews for this place - this wasn't the worst sushi I've ever had, but it comes pretty close to the bottom of the list. If it matters to you, this is a very Korean sushi place, not Japanese run - complete with K-pop videos and a particularly cute flower boy (pretty) waiter who looked straight out of my Korean dramas.   Service was very friendly and since it was empty, the food came out ridiculously fast. This is normally a positive, except that in this case, speed meant careless and sloppy sushi. I got mostly nigiri and everything seemed pretty fresh, but the rice was borderline hard, and the nori was coming off nigiri and hand rolls. My friend's fancy rolls were ok, but drowned in way too much sauce.   One of the daily specials was ocean trout, which I've never tried before, but now LOVE - it's really similar to salmon, but better somehow... Spicy tuna on crispy rice was the only other thing I'd say was good. They didn't have a few of the sides pictured on yelp like the fish collar, and nothing that we tried was really above mediocre.   Rib eye was half well done, half rare. Japanese hamburg steak (like salisbury steak) was ok, but weird to serve it without rice. Ika yaki grilled squid was rubbery but not bad. Poor grilled baby octopus skewer was just cooked to hell, but I liked the kochujang sauce. Teri chicken was a big bowl of chicken w/ lots of stir fried veggies, friend said it was ok. Soft shell crab tasted like old oil. Pork belly was soft, but not much flavor. Seared tuna with AJ sauce (whatever that is) was a mess, but tasted ok. Uni was sweet and better than some other ayce places. Spicy scallop wasn't spicy at all, and was barely even scallop - it was mostly mildly spicy imitation crab.   We mostly came here because of positive yelp reviews, along with some miscommunication on which sushi place a friend had recommended (we found out later that she wasn't talking about Umiya). Unless I came to stalk the cute Korean waiter, I won't be back. I always forget to abide by the rule where if a sushi place has majority non-Asian customers, you should just leave. Every single crappy sushi place I've been to, I look around before we leave and it's a lot of non-Asians enjoying an awesome california roll. Racist to say...sure, but it's been True so far at least in my experience.",

Then she came back five minutes later, warned us one more time how we must finish every grain of rice or we will be charged. We were like... Huh? Really? We barely started eating. Then food started coming, and other older Korean waitress started coming to us to SERIOUSLY remind us of NOT leaving any rice on the table OR they will CHARGE US!! She literally stayed at the table for 30 seconds to advocate this rule. At this point, we were very irritated and we actually tried eating as much rice as we could as they put so much rice on every roll :((    Food was very good, service overall was attentive.   But, BE AWARE OF the two Korean ladies that will NOT stop harassing you if you are the only table there. Don't go too early.   Be rice lover too !!",

This was Chad S's UYE and I couldn't resist the combination of meeting new Yelpers and eating sushi.  When it comes to this place, it's all about AYCE.  I'm one of those guys that can eat a ton, so AYCE is never a bad choice.  As for the food, I got so much of it that it's tough for me to remember, but I'll try.  -Yellowtail and Tuna Nigiri:  Small, but since it's AYCE it wasn't an issue. Tasty, fresh, and the texture was just right. Believe me, I've had some stale dry nigiri before.  My favorite Yellowtail is still at Kaizen off Paradise.  -Katsu Chicken:  Not bad, just a little greasy.  Still fresh and crunchy.  Tasted perfect with their chicken fried rice.  -Chicken Fried Rice:  Thick pieces of chicken mixed with their fried rice.  If it's not sushi to come here for, then it's their fried rice.  -Ramen (miso):  Just okay, but it's also one of my first ramens.  Not much to compare against. I didn't think it was bad, but others have stated that Chinatown has better.  -Tempura Shrimp Hand Roll:  I use to be a western roll type of person. Now it's all about Nigiri, Shashimi, and Hand Rolls.  Still got a yum yum type hand roll and it didn't disappoint.  Again, small but it's ACYE.  -Tempura Ice Cream:  Not a dessert person, but couldn't resist on this visit.  This was pretty good too.   Service wasn't bad considering that our group was fairly big.  Between all the food request from other Yelpers, the fact it was Friday night, and because this location was close to the strip..I felt that the service was decent.   Overall, I will be back.  There's a ton of other sushi joints out here in Vegas.  But this one is little closer to the strip, which makes it a good stop when out of town friends/family are in the sushi mood.   Thanks to Chad S. for setting this up.  Got to meet some Yelp friends that I've never met in person.  Also was able to hang out with some Yelpers that still are the coolest peeps around. New Yelper Alicia R (Terri R's twin) was in attendance. She ended up being my run/walk buddy for the next day's Color Run 5K.  Good thing because I thought I would be the only walker at this event.",

    "text": "Disappointed. I followed the recommendation of fellow Yelpers to this spot in search of great sushi in Vegas - after going here I am 100% certain that anyone who says this is good sushi has 100% never had good sushi.   While we were settling in, one of the sushi rollers dropped off a salmon sashimi salad in front of us which we thought was complementary, as in our past experience at sushi joints sitting at the bar sometimes yields tasting plates on the house. Well, apparently this was not meant for us. When our server came back to take our order, a man whom I can only assume to be the owner or manager started yelling, asking if we ordered the tiny salad in front of us. I said no. And he began to yell at the workers behind the counter. It was very strange and uncomfortable. I finished the rest of the salad, which ended up being the best thing we ate.   Our plate of sashimi was made and given to us by the same man, who dropped the plate and then quickly picked something off a piece of tuna before saying, \"ok it's good.\" Not very reassuring... All the fish - salmon, tuna, and super white tuna, left a strange after taste that was off putting. Doesn't need to be said, but not a good sign when eating raw fish.   Lychee martini tasted of straight lychee juice with a splash of saki and had whole ice cubes floating in it. Rolls were reasonably priced and large in size, but again, I just didn't feel the fish tasted all that fresh, and even the avocado on them looked past its prime.   Service is a mess and food nor drinks make up for it. Would not go back or recommend. Shout out to the sushi roller though. He was really friendly and cool.",

    "text": "Trying another AUCE sushi joint cuz damnit, I'm hungry and this spot is right by my credit union that I stopped at and because SOMETHING is going on with Woo Che! Second day I've rolled by there and they've been closed! AND I almost went to go try Korean Garden BBQ cuz they have a pretty cheap AUCE BBQ price but I quickly pulled up some reviews and they were weird. ANYHOO. This is what I stuffed into the fat girl stuck inside of my body:  Spicy Garlic Edamame - a little overcooked, some of the shells were downright MUSHY. The flavor was OK. A little spicy, but not much and the garlic flavor was rather mild. I LOVE garlic.  Marinated Pork Belly - I have been CRAVING pork belly lately! This didnt necessarily satisfy my craving either. The pork belly itself was melt in your mouth tender and the marination was aiight. Not bad at all - I am just personally craving some samgyupsol!  Grilled Shishito Peppers - served with Bonito flakes on the side. I always love shishito peppers but these could have use some togarashi!  Crispy SS Crab - I highly DON'T recommend this. Too much breading and not enough flavor. I even tried dipping it in some spicy mayo but ended up just leaving the other half, untouched.   Baked New Zealand Mussel in Dynamite Sauce - these were good. Nothing stuck out about them but they werent bad at all.  Seafood Dynamite - good as well. Typically these taste the same wherever I get them. Not bad at all.  Tuna Poke - this was REALLY good! A little seaweed salad on the side and just enough seasoning and spiciness to leave me wanting more!  Jalapeno Popper - spicy tuna and cream cheese inside the jalapeno and deep fried. Um. No. I ate one out of the four. Just not a good combination and really not much flavor. They probably deseeded the jalapeno taking all of it's delicious spiciness with and the half way cooked spicy tuna inside wasn't cuttin it. Besides, COOKED spicy tuna is NOT something I EVER look forward to.  The Nigiri I tried was:  Tuna, Albacore, Super White Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. ALL of it was VERY good. Very fresh tasting and fatty and melt in your mouth. The Albacore was kind of fishy but that just might be how the fish is suppose to be. I'm not a fan of really fishy tasting fish, but some people are!   Anyway I finished off my meal with a salmon and avocado hand roll and a banana split!!!! I love handrolls and this one did not disappoint! Really good quality fish!  And my banana split was a nice small personal size - just a scoop of vanilla with a banana and some chocolate syrup. Simple and tasty.   Four stars for the NIGIRI. Three stars for the rest of the menu.",

None of the dishes I tried knocked my socks off and that's the only reason I wear socks to restaurants but I would go back.  They have a local cult following as this restaurant was recommended by a die hard \"Umiyaer\" that visits weekly.  There's a hashtag so I believe they exist.  I have never heard of this restaurant prior to last week but I'm glad I got to enjoy their offerings.  If I lived or worked closer to their location (right by the Palms Casino) I would go back as it's priced well but since I don't engorge myself during lunch (2 rolls are filling) I would feel that I'm not getting the full experience.  I guess that just means I will have to visit on numerous occasions which my belly would be OK with.",

    "text": "The best selling point of this AYCE sushi spot is the addition $10 cost for all you can drink draft beers and house sake.  But other than that, this is a really solid spot.    Another thing Umiya did right being \"new\" is adopting what's good and getting rid of what didn't work.  Umiya is not totally new, it was the former Kaizen Fusion.  But with the name change it severs any affiliation with the other Kaizen.. except the sushi names have been kept the same.    The only times I come in is during their slow hours and before dinner service.  Because it's slow, service has been great.  I sit up right at the bar and get even better/faster service.  Any time you can order straight to the Chef, that's how you should do it.  Trust me it works, I've done it at Honey Salt.  If you come in during lunch like me it's not worth upgrading to dinner price for the Uni/Ama ebi/Seared tuna sashimi.    There were some good items and some AYCE grade sushi, neither is bad.  If you know what to look for then ask for it, more likely than not they'll have it or he'll lie and say he doesn't.  Some of the few items I asked for was salmon belly, fresh wasabi, yellowtail belly, etc.  They had some of these items but not advertised anywhere, so ask.   When you come in, order everything you can order one item of which includes:  Baby Octopus, Gingko (if you know herbal medical properties or take vitamins then order it, if not, don't), pork belly, oysters.  Ask for specialty fishes, every time I have come in there hasn't been one but keep asking.  Uni was good, ama ebi I was a little disappointed in especially the pre-prepped head/deep fried antennas.    The ice cream was good and I confirmed it by ordering a second but different flavor.  The waitress gave me a hard time about getting another even though I told her I'd pay for another, separate it on a different check if she needed, there was no language barrier here and I knew I only get one per AYCE.",

I've dined here on several occasions and each time was because I was REALLY HUNGRY and wasn't feeling the wait at either Goyemon or Sushi Koma during prime times (around 7pm) of the night. This place can really turn and burn- and for an AYCE restaurant? I'm quite impressed.  The quality of the food wasn't there for me. The first couple of bites after coping with starvation is good but it's sad to realize that you're judgement will drastically change once you're 30% full. The menu is more extensive than most AYCE restaurants but I guess that's why you're getting mediocre quality dealing with the amount of overhead this place carries. The fresh oysters? Probably my favorite part of the place but it limits one time order per diner. Bummer, really.  The service really stood out for me. The staff didn't mind how busy it was and was heavily focused on attending to our every need. Water refills, clearing empty plates off the table, letting our server know that we wanted to order more; their teamwork have earned their high tip since working at an AYCE restaurant can seem annoying.  The best part? Food will literally come out the minute after you order. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing but it was definitely good since we were hungry. If I'm ever on a time restraint, I'll come back. If I'm looking for quality vs. quantity, I won't. This place has its perks though.",

Excited to have found a great new sushi place, I went back to try the lunch specials, which were also great. However, over the last few months the quality and service have taken a nosedive.   A friend and I were in on a Sat night for AYCE dinner. We were seated promptly even though it was somewhat busy, but we hadn't even got our coats off before someone came to take our order. Clearly not ready yet. Then, when we were ready, despite the army of staff, no one came. I'll spare the extensive list of service fails throughout the evening, but it's really the service that is earning the 2 star rating here. Basically, we didn't get what we ordered the first time, were unable to get someone to take a follow up order, had food thrown down on the table by servers on their way to somewhere else, and were overcharged. To top it off, the fish was bland and the portion sizes had shrunk from previous visits. I'd rate the food about 2.5 stars. Time to scratch this one off the list. There's just so many better places in town.",

Even the uni and unagi were delicious (two dishes that come to mind that tend to be underwhelming for all you can eat sushi). The selection is HUGE and the rolls are really original. Highly recommend the banana roll, Alaska roll, bacon and scallop skewers, orange blossom roll. would come again when I'm in town. YAY!!!!!!!!!!",

Creamy agedashi tofu that melts in your mouth and tuna poke that make me want to poke you (hahaha)! Where else can you find a roll with high self esteem (\"I love my ass roll\")? Bottom line: skip the strip and eat here for good quality Japanese food that will make you feel like you are sitting at a Tokyo table.",

This is a place that I can take friends who do not enjoy sushi.  They can still eat a lot of food and get their money's worth too while I gorge on sushi.  It has something for everyone.  I would have given it 5 stars if the service was not so slow toward the middle/end.  I feel like they purposely slowed down on making our orders at the end because we were eating so much.  The slow service was in reference to the cooks/sushi chefs only.  The waiter and waitresses were all sweet and attentive.",

I was very disappointed by the quality of their food although the service was not bad...There are so many better AYCE sushi places out there. Don't choose this one!!",

A lot of the rolls are renditions of the previous roll, just with the addition or removal of one ingredient.  BUT, if I asked them to change a roll to make it more interesting they did it without hesitation. AYCE pricing is the same as everywhere else in town, so I wasn't surprised at all by the price. The environment is really nice and open, doesn't feel crowded or busy like many of the other sushi restaurants, so that was a definite plus. The staff here was ON POINT, they tended to all of our needs and we're very helpful. I couldn't even finish my glass of water before the waitress came around to fill it up again haha.  I will definitely return to this place.",

We mostly went back because of our favorite waitress (Jeanie) who always provides the best service and knows our order before we go.  We were going go stop coming here after the issues we had but we literally stayed for now because of Jeanie and the relationship we built with her. She makes us feel at home.   I told her about our issue last time with not being able to get our favorite roll that we have gotten for the past year. She was very surprised and went up to the chefs and they made us two of them on the spot. Hopefully our bad experience last time was just a new waitress in a bad mood or some kind of confusion (although I dont see how it could have been confusion) Hopefully we dont run into another weird situation.",

    "text": "Wow. Thank you yelpers! After your recommendations we ventured off the strip and tried this place! Never had AYCE sushi before, and now Im wondering if we have these in Texas.  They explain the rules up front: 90 minutes, items with a 1 you can only order once per person, if there's a D it's dinner only, and if you leave too much behind you will pay extra! Knowing that...we started! Major pro: for the sushi rolls you can do a half order! This is awesome! It allowed us to experience so much more! So here is what we ordered: Tuna poke- tender, favorable, delicious  Miso ramen- eh. Not the star of the party. Tasted like packaged ramen.  Pork belly- YUMMY! Flavorable, crisp, delicious!  Yum yum roll- this was my favorite! So much flavor! Vegas lasagna- again delicious! Excellent blend of flavors Shrimp lover roll- basic but good  Rattlesnake roll- this was my least favorite roll. It wasn't bad, but I could do without it  Banana roll- this was surprisingly good. The sweet of the banana and the savary of the crab inside was a good pairing  Green chili tempura roll- I didn't taste green chili. This is another roll I could do without. It wasn't bad, it was just ok Fresh n easy roll- wrapped in cucumber and no rice, it was good! I liked it!   I'm leaving here about 10 lbs heavier but it was worth it! If you're visiting Vegas come here. You won't be disappointed!",

Ambiance: 3 - nice looking place with a fun atmosphere and giant tables to fill with sushi. So basically umiya is really nice for group dinners and sushi dates, etc.   Service: 2 - They were really great people with nice personalities, but our service was pretty terrible. They had a big group walk in on them and they couldn't really handle the rest of the restaurant. Food came really slow, and we were still pretty hungry afterwards.   Food: 1 - If you would like to dine here, I suggest the garlic tuna nigiri and the soft shell crab appetizer. Those were the only 2 things out of the menu that I liked.   Food took a long time to come to our table, so dishes that were supposed to be warm were cold and cold dishes were warm. But even then it didn't really taste great for me, so I still stick by to my 2 recommendations above. Have a good time dining, but I probably won't come back!",

Also, they charge for hot tea? What kind of asian restaurant charges for tea :/ There are so many other places to eat in Vegas DO NOT GO HERE. Waste of your time and stomach space. (Also, my stomach felt kind of uncomfortable afterwards..) I will say that I liked their sweet potato tempura though.  UPDATE:I got food poisoning from this place. DO NOT GO HERE.

My partner and I walked from the Excalibur thinking it wasn't too far -- we wouldn't recommend doing this, as we walked for over an hour and had to cross the freeway.  Umiya had a great selection of items, and all of their staff are super attentive and friendly. The neat thing is that Umiya lets you do \"half-orders\" so that you can try a lot of different things. We didn't see any sashimi on the menu, but this was fine for us since we had poke.  Great price point for AYCE -- we really didn't feel like paying premium prices that you'd typically find I the strip. The restaurant itself is quite large, and unfortunately there wasn't a lot of people there when we went on a Tuesday night (unfortunate because it's quite a cool spot). Those that were there -- we think -- are locals, so it's nice to dine where locals dine.",

Pros:  - All you can eat dinner for $26! We had (for apps): fried oysters, soft shell crab, pork belly and gyoza. All delicious! We ordered 4 half rolls and 1 full roll (all great!). Then 2 mochi (awesome!) and 2 tempura ice cream. Walked away pretty full and very satisfied (not stuffed and uncomfortable). In summary, the food was great as expected.  - Food arrived timely - Service was good  - Noise level = good! Not too quiet but great for conversation  - We didn't have to wait for a table at 6:30pm on a Friday in December  Cons:  - The waitress literally warned us that they would charge us for food not eaten even if we said we \"didn't like the roll\" :-X I understand what they are trying to do here, but it was maybe too stern of a warning. I think instituting a \"no more than x rolls every x minutes per person unless the food is gone/eaten\" is perhaps a better way of getting people to not order a ton of food just because it's all you can eat. - I'm nitpicking here, but I would like to see a larger selection of alcohol, especially beer. But this is an overall complaint of mine for most Asian cuisine restaurants so take it with a grain of salt   Overall a great value and delicious food for Vegas. I always complain that it's hard to use Yelp in Vegas because everything is rated 3.5 stars or higher. I've been to Vegas 5 times and this place, in my opinion, is above average! Check it out if you don't mind going off the strip!",

Well, it is not authentic Japanese sushi, so we just ordered a little bit to eat. But if you like all kind of sushi rolls, you can try. We had the salmon skin salad which was good but way too salty for me, especially on the bottom of the bowl, it's all kind of mixed soy source. The other yellow tail sushi roll, well like I said it is American style to taste of",

Portions were reasonable and balanced (decent sized pieces of sushi that weren't overwhelmed by gigantic portions of rice).   Best sushi I ever had? No. But the food was good and overall excellent value compared to the overhyped overpriced establishments on the strip. Definitely worth the trek for a $20 lunch/$25 dinner.

I would highly recommend the tuna poke and the seared tuna. Each person is only limited to one, but it was delicious! The nigiri was also pretty good. I personally liked the scallops one. It was definitely a great deal for everyone at the table, and I was really impressed by the quality of sushi for AYCE. It's not the most amazing fish that I've ever tried, but given that it's AYCE, it was pretty good.  The things I would not recommend are the oyster and ice cream. My friends said the oysters did not taste fresh, and I didn't even try because it didn't seem particularly appetizing. My ice cream had freezer burn, so that was disappointing as well.  Overall, we had a good experience, and it was so worth it!",

    "text": "The Skinny: came on a Tuesday... after having a 2 star meal experienced the bathroom Olympics with the hubs. Avoid! (1) service: slightly zealous server who wanted to know what we wanted right away(3) Value: there is no real positive value when your head is in the toilet (0)  Okay, it was my fault. After being without sushi for 3 months, I had a big craving. So after looking at the reviews online we settled at this place for lunch.  We came for lunch to check things out. We were kind of leery about making a huge commitment to ordering the AYCE option. First of all, we weren't that hungry and we had a Yelp event planned later in the evening. Secondly, the AYCE menu is $21 for lunch, consisted largely of carb heavy rolls and cooked items which didn't really appeal to us (there is no sashimi on the AYCE menu).  Our server was slightly overly attentive to the point where she was checking every 2-3 minutes of us getting seated to put in our order.  We ended up ordering 2 lunch specials. I got the sushi combo which comes with 4 pieces of nigiri and a choice of spicy tuna or California roll plus miso soup. ($10.95)The hubs got the bento box with a spicy tuna roll, tempura, salad and miso soup.($9.95)  Our food came out suspiciously fast - like definitely not in a good way kind of fast. Like literally within 5 minutes of getting our soup.   The miso soup tasted like bilge water. The little tofu swimming in there looked like the dehydrated stuff you reconstitute from the small miso soup packets.  My sushi combo was supposed to be salmon, red snapper, tuna. The fish tasted very ummm...fishy in an unpleasant way with a slightly mushier texture than expected for sushi grade product. The rice was not seasoned well and was too firm. The maki spicy tuna roll incorporated way too much hot sauce so it suspiciously masked whatever flavor of fish that was in there. More on that later.  The hubs experience with his spicy tuna roll was the same as mine above. His tempura was overly battered and thick. The salad was a tad sweet but was otherwise okay.  Overall, at that point we were thinking 2 starred joint. Nothing too offensive, but not great either. Definitely not a repeat experience. We figured hey! it was only like a $10 meal per person and didn't set us back too much.  That is until we got home and the vomiting began.   How I heaved into my toilet! Betwixt me and my beloved hubby, we were out for the count. We were totally bummed that we had to miss out on a Yelp event due to the the food poisoning.  At the time of writing this review, the bile is still rising in my throat from the thought of what I ate for lunch. Deep down, I think perhaps the spicy tuna is the culprit as it was the only common denominator for my hubs and I.  So for that, Umiya, you've joined my +1club.",

My favorite thing about sushi is the nigiri. Umiya's nigiri is very fresh and so worth the cost of ayce. My favorite nigiri here are unagi, salmon, giant clam, yellowtail, halibut, garlic tuna, and sweet shrimp. I'm not much of a roll eater, but I highly recommend the Rattle Snake Roll and the Touchdown Roll. Best of all, mochi ice cream is included in ayce, so many sushi restaurants don't. Overall, this is my favorite sushi restaurant for ayce!  I also threw a birthday party here once and they brought out a plate with ice cream and mochi decorated with whipped cream and caramel syrup and it was so nice of them. The waiter passed around sake and beer throughout my table and all the waiters and sushi chefs joined us as well. It was just one fun experience!",

    "text": "I will not be returning to this restaurant. I came in with a friend after his date ditched him. I said lets go to where his date wanted to go. We tried the all you can eat dinner menu.  First off, their menu is highly incorrect. I asked for seared salmon. Both times it was taken out and guess what...???? It wasn't even seared. Seared salmon is torched and becomes a light pink. Each time the \"seared salmon\" came out it was raw. After explaining to the waiter that this is not seared for the third time, he never returned to the table. I don't believe that's how the customer service industry works. It took over 30 mins for someone to bring us our bill. My date had to get up 2x to ask for the check. If he didn't get up, how long would it have taken? Hmmm.... The food was so so. Tempura calamari, I would not recommend. Crispy rice with spicy tuna was alright, not the best. Chicken skewer tasted like a McDonald's chicken nugget. Enjoyed my miso soup, and cucumber salad, which explains the sushi was not good or fresh tasting.  I was so hungry after leaving this place I went to another restaurant to get to-go. I highly regret going here. 1 star!!!",

Huge selection and everything is fresh and served how you want it and nicely displayed by expert sushi artist chefs. I have been to this place like every couple months for a treat and to bring company visiting town.  Everyone is friendly and the price is about $25 for AYCE per person which is very reasonable.  They also seem to have a full bar and some fancy non alcoholic drinks.  With so many sushi places in Las Vegas we keep coming back here.  I won't give names but it is much better than a sushi place on the strip that if you ordered what you ate their it would be five times the price and not close to as good.  This place is close to the strip but maybe a half hour from where I live however it is well worth the trip!",

    "text": "My family was coming in to town for Christmas, and we decided to have dinner here on Christmas Day. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance.  The interior was very modern, with bench-style seating and pop music videos playing from screens on the wall. It was also definitely on the noisier (but lively) side in terms of atmosphere.  The restaurant was VERY busy that night, and they almost gave up our table (they will only hold for 15 minutes after your reservation time, and your whole party must be present to be seated). Service was friendly, but I don't think food came quite as fast as some other Yelpers have been mentioning in their reviews. In particular, any hot kitchen items (e.g. that required deep-frying or baking) seemed to take a particularly long time to prepare. They also ran out of some \"dinner only\" items such as uni and even agedashi tofu at one point, which is kind of silly since it was only 7PM and the restaurant is open until 2AM. In addition, the lunch and dinner menus are essentially the same, so to charge several dollars more per person for dinner without having all the dinner items in stock is a bit unfair.  Overall, the food was very tasty, and the menu is extensive. Like another Yelper mentioned, I think they shine more in the appetizer/non-rolls area, as the sushi rolls were not particularly special/memorable.   They didn't strictly enforce the 90-minute time limit, but did start trying to nudge us along after that time passed (given that there were people waiting for tables). One of the managers wanted to give us the check, but we said we were still waiting for some dessert items. In addition, my mom's boyfriend ended up proposing to her during this meal. That same manager was very honest though, as he came back to explain that they had already added an 18% gratuity since we were a large group and the payer had inadvertently tipped based on the post-gratuity amount.  My aunt and uncle were griping about how this was a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant, but at this point, I'm used to it. There are a ton of Korean-owned Japanese restaurants in many different states, and while they are usually not 100% authentic, they still serve up decent food.  Oh, and if you don't want to opt for all-you-can-eat, there is a regular menu too/you can always order a la carte. However, it is really easy to spend the same amount as AYCE, so you might as well choose AYCE unless you just aren't that hungry.  P.S. Don't forget to utilize the call buttons on the table! We forget they were there.",

    "text": "Lots of places to choose from but we ended up here to the \"all you can eat\" sushi in LV.    This place had a lot of highs and a lot of lows.   After everything was said and done, we left with mixed reviews.      The good:   The fried soft shell crab.  Excellent!  Get it! The oysters.  Fresh shucked and tasty!  Ordered as many as we could.     The ok: Udon noodles.  Meh.    The bad: The fish......  Ugh.   Metallic tasting and not fresh.  Bad after taste.  The onions were not fresh, dried and dehydrated in the rolls.    The really bad: The soups.  Tonkatsu ramen was terrible.   Tasted nothing like tonkatsu and didn't eat it.   The miso soup was even worse.  Watered down to the point it was not edible.  Almost refused it but decided to just not eat it.     Overall the highs and lows will prove to be enough to not eat here.   It was not quality at all as far as fish goes.     Customer service was fast, courteous and friendly.    Eat at your own risk.    Not recommended.",

Serving size can be order in half or full which no waste of food and money. I love pretty much what I've order from the appetizers to the main course. They have a variety of selections and so overwhelming didn't get to try a lot what's in the menu . I tried some bake mussels and it's pretty darn good. I can't even remember all the sushi roll I've order aside from the classic one's like dragon rolls. This is one of my best place to go!!",

Ordered pretty much one of every item that was designated as limit of 1 per person for dinner rate which was a little over a dozen dishes including the daily specials. Ate all of it and then some. Tried to avoid the rolls and nigiri that have a lot of rice. Was highly impressed at the speed and quality of all the food. It probably helped that we came around 4:30 pm for dinner. Definitely on my list to hit up whenever I'm back in Vegas. Make sure to leave a generous tip if you're a fat pig that eats a lot like me.",

Fresh and wide variety of rolls and nigiri, appetizers and cooked dishes for a super deal of less than $21 per person at lunch.

    "text": "So I came here with my friend over the weekend. After looking at their menu, I proceeded to ask if they were affiliated with Sumo Sushi and the waitress said yes.   The environment was lovely and just love all the bench seating. The service was great until after we got our desserts. No refilling of water and they weren't anywhere to be found.   The food was okay, nothing great. They made their rolls really weird is all I can say. For instance, philly roll, instead of putting everything inside the roll like its suppose to be, the salmon was on top and it just made it taste a bit off. Their poke tasted pretty horrible. It didn't seem like nice big chunk of smooth tuna, instead it was grainy like. The hand roll was just filled with rice, just way too much.  Overall, I didn't enjoy myself. I definitely would not be coming back at all. I prefer Sumo Sushi I/II instead.",

I had the most excellent and memorable bento box special that I've ever had - the pre-meal miso soup was well paced, like a minute after I ordered, a dramatic pause, then the main course bento box came rolling out. There are actually 8 types of bento boxes, and I got the 4-piece sushi & chicken teriyaki.   What made this bento box the bestest was the chicken teriyaki specially prepared with artfully cut carrots, zucchini, mushroom, broccoli, onions, in a savory sauce. And the tempura had 5 or 6 pieces, usual fare plus a bonus gyoza! Salad and sushi were very good, no extra descriptive words necessary. Very enjoyable all around, and the waitress checked on how I was doing 5 or 6 times, very kind and attentive.   The decor and ambiance neatly minimalistic with wooden tables and benches, sushi bar, and 2 side box rooms for a little more privacy. And with a Starbucks next door, the wifi signal is strong enough for me to hangout here a bit longer and cowork. Sweetness!",

My wife, not being a fan of sushi, had the the gyoza & BBQ'd short ribs and she raved about them. The servers were attentive w/o being overbearing. The only criticisms (very minor) that I have were: the lame looking wooden picnic-styled benches and the 90 minute time limit for the AYCE, but then I was easily able to eat my fill in one hour anyway. Finally, the fact that we saw many happy Japanese patrons during our time at Umiya was quite comforting.  I can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Another sushi restaurant in a city of plenty.  Umiya is located right next to Starbucks in a plaza off of Flamingo and Arville. It's a very nicely decorated sushi spot definitely the nicest, 5 star for just that.   They offer a large AYCE menu of sushi and non-sushi items with a few items that you can only order one order of, as many other sushi restaurants do. Order the items that you can only order one order of and on chef's special menu first, just to get them out of the way.  They have a pork belly that could maybe rival Goyemon, maybe, I don't remember how Goyemon pork belly taste like again I need to go again soon. It's 3 delicious thinly sliced pieces of pork belly in a sauce that just melts in your mouth.  I made the mistake of sharing once, never again all mine.  They serve a fried soft shelled crab which was heavily battered which wasn't my favorite but it could be with less batter. Their baby octopus are very delicious. Their nigiris and hand rolls aren't that bad too.  Their beef was very good.  Oysters fried and not fried, poke salad, specialty rolls, deep fried tempura rolls, shrimp tempura, uni, everything you usually expect from a sushi spot they probably had it.  Drinks aren't included in the AYCE sushi price you pay extra, soft drinks were extra $2 but refill are included.  Also they no longer have AYCD on for extra $10 its something like buy 2 get the 3rd free for certain drinks. Know you limits when drinking they probably won't kick you out for being a drunken mess but it annoys everyone elses who are trying to have a nice meal with family and friends, especially if there in another party.  As always when going to a sushi restaurant sit at the bar right infront of the sushi chefs, you'll get food faster and chefs are usually pretty cool guys. Customer service was great but once if got busy they had a hard time keeping up with food and drink orders. Try not going when busy but if your patient enough like I am go whenever you feel like sushi.   Their prices are average, sushi quality and selection good, but probably won't replace any of my top 5 but top 10 in Vegas sure.",

The food on the other hand is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I read the reviews and thought it would be nice to try a new spot, what an awful waste of a day off.  I'm sorry to rip into this place, but I hope they read this. The oysters (which are my favorite thing to eat) were so bad I couldn't eat more than one.  It tasted so fishy and awful compared to the number of oysters I've had in my life.  The yellowfin tuna was like dull brown yellow with a fishy taste as well.  We were told if we didn't finish food from our all you can eat that we would be charged. Never have I ever left food because I didn't like it, until last night.  Soho blows this place away on a whole new level.  If you want a descent priced all you can eat sushi, I recommend GOYMON, and it's not that far.  Goymon's service sucks but the food at least taste better. If you want sushi that actually taste like SUSHI and FRESH fish go to SOHO, the M, Naked FISH, anywhere but this place.",

The chef gave us some special sushi that wasn't on the menu, which was simply amazing. We were the few people there so I think the chef felt trigger-happy to shoot us a few special dishes. I'm not complaining.  Also, I'm not a huge roll fan but I have to say they use very little sauce and it actually compliments the sushi nicely. The ribeye steak was great. The nigiri is fresh and served with very little rice. I would like to revisit Umiya again and focus more on the nigiri but the rolls and special dishes were simply too good for me to leave room for anything else. But from the tuna, yellowtail and shrimp nigiri I ate I could say it was great. Cheers that Kaizen is out and Umiya is in. Looking forward to my next visit.",

Definitely NOT coming back here again because I'm a huge fan of great customer service. It really ruins the mood of the night.",

The Good: Decor (Very nicely decorated, lots of space and table room) Salmon nigiri Ika Nigiri Yelp check-in = free drink  The Bad: Service (No one even looked me in the eye, let alone acted friendly, aside from the lone waitress) Yellowtail (Not horrible, but probably one of the worst I've had in Vegas) Ikura (Noticeably small and tasted kind of funky) Charge for hot tea  The Okay: Everything else we ate (all nigiri, mochi ice cream) Presentation (ex: tuna poke was haphazardly piled onto the place with seaweed salad, looked unappealing, bad cuts of fish)  Fresh oysters offered only for dinner even though it's not indicated on the menu like other dinner-only items.

    "text": "Came here for AYCE sushi on a Sunday afternoon after finding it on Yelp, and was more than pleased with my meal.   The tables are big wooden picnic style tables, so not the most comfortable, but they fit the atmosphere of the restaurant. There were a lot of servers and sushi chefs working so service was quick and efficient. Everything we ordered came out so quick it was great!   The fish was fresh and the presentation great. Everything we ordered was fantastic. My only gripe is that we came shortly after 3pm so I assumed it was lunch and did not order any dinner only items. Then realized after ordering dessert that their dinner pricing starts at 3pm! What a bummer because there were specials and items that I really wanted too. Also I fee like 3pm is so early to be considered dinner :/",

    "text": "Goyemon has been my favorite AYCE sushi joint in town for quite a while and I've been very hesitant to try other places because I'm always disappointed when I do. However, I was really craving uni and Goyemon was all out so we decided to give Umiya a try based on all the great reviews. Now I see what I've been missing out on.   Pros: Oysters, uni, amaebi A lot of items on AYCE menu Half rolls available Dinner starts at 3pm  Cons: No salmon skin Extra 50 for quail egg Only ice cream desserts Dinner starts at 3pm  Firstly, they have quite a selection of items to order, which is great because you're likely to find a few rolls that float your boat. They also let you order half rolls, so you can try more rolls.  I mean the whole point of going to AYCE places is so you can order a lot of different things.   I love that the dinner menu starts at 3pm, because uni and the seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce is only available for dinner. It's totally worth the extra $5 for me, but if you don't like uni, amaebi, or seared tuna sashimi, this wouldn't be a pro for you as those three items are basically the only difference between lunch and dinner. (The seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce is so good though! I'd definitely recommend everybody to try it)  The sushi chefs and serve staff are rock stars. It was packed during my first visit and everybody was hard at work. The chefs banged out orders and didn't let a plate sit for more than a few seconds before yelling out the table number again for the servers to pick it up. We came back just a few days later (this time during the day when it was super slow) and the chefs were all busy prepping for the night. We never saw any of the employees just standing around not doing anything.",

So, when my sushi-loving brother came to town, I decided to take  him there. Big mistake. The staff was rude, the food was rushed, and good flavors were nowhere to be found.  There was no greeting when we walked in, and all the person at the check-in desk said was \"you are going to have to wait, ok?\" After waiting for about 10 minutes (mind you, we had reservations), the same rude server walked us over to our table and sat us down. No interest in knowing if it was our first time, nothing... he just left. Once our waiter knew some of us were not doing AYCE, every server became obsessed wanting to know why that was the case. They repeated the AYCE no-sharing rules several times, despite everyone understanding we could not share the food.  Most dishes were wrong and bland, with the servers dropping off dishes we hadn't ordered and then running off to waiting other tables. We then had to flag down any of the servers running by to take the unwanted food away. I get they were busy, but the way the staff was literally running around and essentially plopping food on the table and leaving, made for an unnecessarily awful ambiance.  I will not be coming to back to this place. Ever.",

The seating is somewhat uncomfortable, with rustic picnic style tables and benches. Being so busy, the noise level is also quite high. Lots of items to choose from on the all you can eat menu and it is reasonably priced. Be sure you make a reservation as we had a group of six on Wednesday night and there was a wait for those who did not have reservations. If you're in the mood for all you can eat sushi, this is a good selection, but I recommend you bring your own seat cushion.",

We put in our order for the first round of food and it's now 701pm and we will haven't received items from the first round. About 45 minutes ago, we put in an order for a second round, and we haven't received any of that order. We've called different wait staff over during the whole time to ask where our food was and nothing ever came. Not quite sure what happened... If I had the luck of carrying cash, I would have dropped some on the table and walked out. Not sure our absence would have even been noticed.   My husband and I were so hopeful for this place. The food is to die for - if you don't mind waiting an hour an a half to get it. Unfortunately, my husband and I will never be returning. I don't even think we got our ACYE money's worth either, because we filled up on our beer while waiting for food. What a shame.",

Now this being the second day in a row for raw seafood, I was a little hesitant, but boy I was not disappointed.  I ordered tuna, super white tuna, fresh water eel well done, and the spicy tataki roll (inside is spicy tuna, with seared tuna, avocado, green onion and pickled onion on the outside. Dressed in hot sauce and ponzu sauce)   I have to say for ayce the rice attached to the sushi was very small compared to most ayce sushi places in Las Vegas.  The fish was very fresh and flavorful.  And with as busy as this restaurant was the food was served very quickly.  Plenty of restaurant staff to ensure speedy delivery and quick refills.  Also when you check in you get a free soda.

After being seated she left us with the menus not asking if we wanted hot tea or water... 5 minutes later I wanted to leave once another customer opened the entrance door directly behind me I felt a cool breeze. I was at discomfort first the terrible greeting, no beverages, uncomfortable wooden chairs and negative feng shui.   As I was waiting patiently and browsing through their menu my waitress came back asking if we were ready to order. Um sure how about I start off with my free drink please. I asked for green tea she said\" cold \"I said \"hot\" she said \"how about cold \"so I said \"okay cold\" assuming that the hot green tea is free refills...   She then took down our order I got done with the first stage, went to the restroom and started throwing up. They forgot a couple of things I asked for and waited as I was receiving my second stage of order, I started to get very sore stomach ache after eating their hamachi and orange flower. I absolutely did not enjoy their sushi with any fish on it because it was NOT fresh... I should have stopped ordering knowing the fact my stomach was sore. Went to the restroom again then came back to my table and I'm not even half way done with my cold green tea she asked \"would you like a refill\" I said \"actually may I get hot green tea I'm not feeling very well\" she said \"it's extra charge but I can give to you this time because you didn't know.\" I said \"thank you\".  I Drank my hot green tea as my stomach felt alittle at ease.... I finished my third stage of order because if you don't finish all of your food it is extra charge. I just felt even worse! Very sick... I spent my New Years in the hospital the entire day and night vomiting   We all got FOOD POISONING!!!!! I am still very sick and highly do not recommend this Resturant.",

I heard this place was good, read some of the reviews, and was drooling over the photos! The restaurant was not that busy, our rolls came out pretty fast, and they were delicious! I usually stick with ordering the nigiri but I wanted to try some new rolls! I loved how the menu had pictures and the descriptions. The food was great but the experience....not so much...we had to ask several times to get our waters refilled and then when we ordered dessert, the one that we would think took longest to make (tempura ice cream) came out first and all others were forgotten (ice cream and mochi). I would definitely go back because the food was great and people deserve second chances! Maybe the service will be better next time!  Oh, and please take out the stupid Harlem shake music video off the loop! It is so annoying! :)",

    "text": "AYCE sushi! It's been a few years since we've been back to Vegas, and we wanted to find a good sushi spot, and I think we may have. For us the sushi rolls were good, but not great. The nigiri however was actually perfect! The ratio of rice to fish was perfect. The rice was perfect, not too dry or wet. The fish tasted fresh and not too small or large. The cut of fish was great. I'm a sucker for sushi spots with \"super white\" and was not disappointed! The appetizers were really good for us. I had the Monkey brains and was very impressed. Dessert was on spot too. We had the deep fried ice cream, which was prefect and the mochi ice cream. The mochi wasn't  your normal mochi you can pick up at Trader Joe's either. My only complaint was you could only have one order  of mochi per person. :(  The service was good. We were the only ones there at first because we came in pretty early for dinner. We had one incident where they sent our deep fried ice cream to another table, but overall we would come back!",

Their nigiri is fresh, the service is speedy and delightful, the ambiance is both charming and clean, and the pricing is lower than I would expect from the quality of the experience. Try this new gem before sampling  their pricer and more reviewed competition, you won't regret it!  Update: visited again almost a year later, the food is just as good as I remember! The porkbelly is delicious and they have tempura ice cream. Yumm!!!",

There were 4 of us, and we ordered 5 rolls, but in the hour and 15 minutes after that, the waitress never came back to take our order.  We had to leave, so we paid $25.00 each for a total of 5 sushi rolls and 2 bowls of miso soup.  Very disappointing!  We could have gone elsewhere and paid half that ($114 plus tip) for 5 sushi rolls.  It's a shame, because I enjoyed the food, but I was extremely frustrated to pay so much for so little.",

The place is clean and the staff are very nice. I did the AYCE lunch special but did not like some of the rolls. When I didn't finish them rolls I was told I would be charged extra to leave them. I ate a few more pieces but really didn't enjoy them. What I did like was their yellowtail sushi and their spicy yellowtail roll. Other than that, I won't be visiting back. :(",

The seating is spread out, long picnic tables and some smaller tables in the back. Not as cramped as some of the other sushi spots in town.   Sometimes it can be a little slow to get your first order in, but once it's in they are good about coming around often to ask if you need anything. Sometimes we have the same wait person and sometimes several come around. They are always pleasant no matter how busy it is.   Good menu, favorites are the green valley roll and kiss of fire. If you don't like the crab with mayo like us you can say no crab and they are very good about that.   For dessert ask to hear the sorbet flavors, these are new and not on the menu. Raspberry is my favorite!",

Food overall GREAT! As you can see in a photo I posted after I ate with the family and friends, that we enjoy our ayce. We ate everything and it was all great.

    "text": "Living in Dayton, OH, sushi, for the wife and me, is a definite no-go.  As a result, we decided to try to get our fill of sushi while in town.  Everyone likely has opinions on the merits of AYCE sushi concept.  However, for us, the tastebuds want what the tastebuds want.  Looking for a place we hadn't previously tried, we went to Umiya Sushi for its AYCE lunch on a Friday.  Located in a strip mall on W. Flamingo just past the Palms, Umiya Sushi offered a decent price ($20.95/person for lunch) for its AYCE sushi.  We sat at the sushi bar in the dimly lit restaurant.  I found the selection offered to be merely average and of seeming lesser quality/freshness (the poke comes immediately to mind) compared to other AYCE sushi places we've been to in Las Vegas.  Service was hit or miss, too, as items that we ordered were forgotten and only delivered after we asked about them or were simply forgotten and we didn't feel the need to inquire about the forgotten item since we had other places to be and things to do.  Umiya Sushi was merely average, at best, and easily the most forgettable meal we had while we were in town.  Call it 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.",

It was about 9 or 10pm and the resturant was still packed, since we had a big group we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for  a table which wasn't a big deal. We did the AYCE for $25/person. There were so many option we decided to stick to the nigiris appetizers and etc. stayed away from the rolls because we knew it was gonna make us full faster. My absolute favorite thing from here was the oysters, grilled squid and seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce! I will come back whenever I'm back in town!   The only thing that grossed me out was when they brought me my water there were chunks of rice I my cup.... And when we tried to pay with a debit card they said that it didn't work and we had to pay with cash..",

    "text": "There are a lot of other AYCE options in the area so next time I'm definitely going to try another place out to see how it is. I'm iffy about coming back here mainly because the service just wasn't good. I know that service can be of less quality when a restaurant is busy but in my case I came at an off hour and only a few tables were full.   The food is good enough for me to come back - the nigiri is of good quality but it can be a hit or miss sometimes you'll get a good cut of fish and other times it won't be as good as another. The tuna poke is also good.   One thing a server said with a sort of attitude when I ordered 10 orders of a nigiri was \"it's 20 pieces, are you sure you're going to eat all that?\" I don't think he realized it was going to be split between my friend and I so he thought I was going to eat it on my own and that's kind of rude to say??? I mean I can read the menu so I know what I'm getting myself into and if I can't eat it all then I'm going to pay for it lol   Another thing is that when you try to flag down a server it seems like they either can't see you or they ignore you. Now I work as a server in the food industry as well and if I were to not be paying more attention to the restaurant patrons my boss would be so pissed and yet these servers are walking around not aware of things half the time.   I think an experience here is a hit or miss for the most part since I've read several other reviews that say negatory things about the service here as well. Come with caution.",

We didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money like you I would on the strip, so our friend told us about this place and said it was BOMB! It was pretty packed when we got there so I'm guessing everyone had the same idea as us.   All you can eat sushi?... but lets just all take a minute to appreciate those 5 words  I feel like sometimes when I eat raw seafood, I get a little picky and concerned if the quality is gonna be good... but OMG the food was so good! The fish looked fresh and everything came out in a timely matter. I didn't think we could eat so much sushi!!   They give you a time limit of an hour and a half, which is more than enough time to eat as much as you want. They also have desserts! Alcohol and tea cost extra. Some items on the menu are limited to one per customer. + The menu has a lot of pictures and tells you exactly what's in it.  I suggest going with a group of people so that way you can eat a little bit of everything. Or if you're super hungry, you can just go by yourself. Either way, it's so worth it! Another suggestion is to order as you go. If you don't end up eating everything, they will charge you extra. So it's better to just order a few things at a time so you know you can finish everything. Think I ended up paying only ~$30 (take in mind I ate like 4 rolls, an udon, steak, 3 appetizers, and dessert). I usually pay that much, if not more, for like 3 sushi rolls at other places.   Definitely a must eat place if you love sushi and are super hungry! I was very impressed by how much food my friends and I consumed! I left feeling so food drunk  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas",

I'd prob have it again if I were in the mood. Hubby had four different rolls, oysters, and dessert. Service was so so. Ambience was not anything too special. We walked out paying less than $50 including tip. Not bad.  We're not local, so can't say I'd return. But we would tell people to give it a shot.",

My favorite roll I had was the Hawaiian roll. It has garlic albacore which I couldn't recommend more! It's amazing but it's sadly the only specialty roll with it and I wanted more! They also had delicious tempura ice cream for dessert. I also had the green valley roll which was ok.   The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though the food was really good, the service wasn't. We were there for 2.5 hours total and they completely forgot about 2 of the rolls that i ordered and the rest of the food took an extremely long time to hit the table. It was busy and I'm a server so I understand but they were so hard to track down to order from or ask for anything that I just said forget it. I didn't really feel like I got my $26 worth but I'm not so full that I hate myself so it's a partial win lol  Overall I'd probably come back for lunch when it's (hopefully) not so busy and a little cheaper.",

    "text": "An average AYCE (all you can eat) sushi restaurant, but I fear that we won't be returning any time soon. The price for AYCE dinner is competitive, at $25.95, but we just weren't satisfied with their appetizer selection and quality of their nigiri.   My boyfriend and I enjoy eating fresh fish, nigiri and trying a few appetizers when we dine at AYCE sushi restaurants, unfortunately the nigiri and appetizers here do not shine. The fish to rice ratio is inconsistent. The sushi rice was undercooked and compacted under paper thin slivers of raw fish. After a couple nigiri my stomach felt dense and full. That's not a good feeling or a good value.   There were a few fish we tried that were extremely enjoyable and sweet such as the albacore and salmon; but the paper thin sliver made it difficult to really enjoy the quality of fish. We actually sent back the salmon belly because it was offensively fishy and old.    I also felt very limited with the appetizer selection, some items were sized too large for us to feel comfortable ordering and the others were just not desirable.   Here are some appetizers that were enjoyable:  Miso Soup Baked Mussels Tuna poke ...that's it?  Pass on these: Jalapeno popper (super dense and crazy filling with ok flavor) Fried soft shell crab (all soggy batter) Most nigiri...  I suggest going to Sakana (on Maryland) for fresh fatty cuts of fish on their nigiri with a generous fish to rice ratio, a big flavorful selection of appetizers and also creative, juicy rolls.",

They say they have a 90 minute time limit, but they do not really enforce it.   They have such a huge selection and i was not dissapointed.

I've heard that they went to another location or the sister company I'm not really sure. But they are amazing and provides you an excellent service.

The moment my sister and I entered the restaurant, it was quite busy so none of the servers greeted us. We only got a half hearted greeting from one sushi chef. Then we waited around 5 minutes for a server to get us seated, but we stood at the front counter awkwardly because one server was busy dealing with checks and talking on the walkie. For the ayce, we didn't even get to look at the menu for 1 minute before the same server came back. He honestly seemed bothered with our presence and all the other servers kept eyeballing our table at first. (??) Throughout our dinner, they didn't come to check up on us to really see how we were doing but it was more like to pick up our empty plates. We were rushed to order more and rushed to finish fast. Not too enjoyable.   When we got to ordering, the rolls came out very quick and there was one nice server who was good with refilling our water.  On to the food... the only ones that stuck out to me were the Who's Your Daddy appetizer and the First Kiss roll. The other rolls tasted similar and was quite lacking on the eel sauce for those that we ordered with eel sauce. But then halfway through our dinner, my sister noticed a hair in our soft shell crab roll.... uhh I know damn well that it is not mine nor hers because our hair is pretty long while that one was significantly short.  Such an inane experience, I won't give this place another chance.",

Also, half orders are available!  I dont think they post it.  But this is a great option.  The menu is great.  Nice selections.  It is here I learned I will never have uni again; ever - not even by accident.  Sorry, it wasn't my thing.  Give me the inside of a steamed crab shell well cooked instead, with lemon and tabasco please.  Their main dining area is set up with several large tables, then some along the wall.  There is a sushi bar and liquor bar.  Nothing fancy and no art to admire... except the edible art!  Maybe that's the point?    Service is good, quick, attentive (don't forget you will be hawk eyed).  Sushi is fresh, some are unique.  There is raw and cooked sushi.  Pricing is $$ - in the range of what to expect for the area.  Yeah, they seem popular.  Just watch the dinner crowd.  You can tell.  A good meal is to be enjoyed here.",

The rest of the dishes were delicious as well! The fish was so unexpectedly fresh!   Service was on point too. They were very attentive! When I called to ask for the check, the Asian male server reminded me about dessert! I totally forgot that it was also included in the AYCE!! I really appreciated that he reminded me about it.

    "text": "Food: Fantastic! Never had to wait too long. Food is plated beautifully; sometimes almost too pretty to eat - ALMOST HAHA. All ingredients are fresh. Nothing tastes fishy.   Ambiance: Lots of seating. Fairly dimly lit restaurant for a more mellow vibe. Very relaxed. You don't feel rushed to turn tables or anything.   Overall: Visited my family and ended up eating at this AYCE establishment. We were served and cared for by a kind and charismatic guy named Curtis. He's the type of person to welcome you and have a sincere chat; instead of doing the minimum by simply taking your order. He takes the time to ask you what you like and make recommendations accordingly.   He walked over to the head chef and came back with a plethora of new entrees to try. We thought it was going to be just one or two dishes, but we were delightfully wrong. He came back with so many dishes that we didn't have to order anymore LOL  Basically, I trust Curtis and his tastebuds. He definitely gives wonderful suggestions. This may sound stalker-esque, but I'll only go if he's working. Please keep him forever hahaha jkidding-ish. :P  Tip: If possible, go eat when CURTIS is serving. He will undoubtedly take great care of you. Your water/tea will always be refilled and he may even help you discover new food outside of your go-to orders. Please allow him to expand your sushi repertoire. Hehe.",

Well this one definitely exceeded my expectations. Service was quick and friendly.... I sat right at the sushi bar. I suggest the pork belly to start off with as an appetizer. I tried several types of nigiri, and all of them were prepared nicely with a decent fish to rice ratio. For $20 lunch price, it is definitely a deal, and very easy to eat your money's worth of good quality sushi.",

They were very accommodating to that fact and I think they had extra people on shift to help us. Service was on point. Food came out no more than five minutes after ordering. As soon as plates were cleaned, they were picked up and our next orders were taken!   Food was fantastic as well. The tuna tataki is a must. Although it is listed as a one time item, I think I had about three rounds. I tried staying away from rolls as I didn't want to fill myself up too fast. I went straight for the one order items. The poke was also pretty damn fresh. Comes with a little side of seaweed salad. All in all I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town. Good choice before the turn up.",

    "text": "I was able to check this place off my bucket list on my recent trip to Vegas.  While the interior of the restaurant isn't very appealing or inviting.  Overall it was a pleasurable experience and staff was friendly.    In the beginning everything tasted fresh.   Towards the end of my meal however the fish started to taste spoiled/old.   I ate mainly nigiri as I'm not big into rolls.   I did try a half of roll of soft shell crab.   All I could taste was greasy fried batter and nothing else.    The tomago was too sweet n mushy.  I'm guessing it's not made in house.  One big thing that would up the quality is the rice.  It didn't have the proper texture sushi rice should have.   Rice is just as important as fresh fish.   If they took the time to make the best quality rice they can, the overall quality would go up just from that single ingredient.    I was impressed by how fast everything came out and how well coordinated the staff is.   I truly respect that as it's not easy to pull off what they are doing. While there was a few items I ate that were disappointing, I would return again.   Definitely a must try if you're a sushi lover.",

I happen to love sesame seeds. There is only about 4 tables with a chair back. Otherwise it's a picnic table & bench. We sat at the sushi bar with 1/2 a back. It was ok.

    "text": "Thursday night I went back to the restaurant around 7:30 and brought a friend for his first time and it was busy inside. We were greeted immediately and given our menus. Our server's name was Daniel and he let us know in the grinning that it was going to be a little slow because it was busy. Other then the little wait for our food it was a great experience. The sushi was amazing as always and the server was very kind and attentive. As soon as people started to leave we received our food much quicker. So if you do go in and it is busy you might expect a decent delay with your sushi since I believe it Kirby just be the one sushi chef so order appetizers and other things to pass the time.",

    "text": "I came here with my brother, my son and niece last week some time. Me and my brother have different preferences in places to go for sushi. He named this one and Oyshi. I picked this place because it had a higher rating. Of course he likes to be opposite than me, he thinks Oyshi is better and doesn't believe in ratings lol. I personally love Sushi Hero and their ratings reflect it. I started at Yama on Flamingo, then to Sakana. Anyway, let's talk about Umiya... I tend to get more of the kitchen stuff now rather than the rolls, and I love the kitchen food here. I always need my fresh oysters, shrimp tempura, seafood salad or some sort, baked mussels and Tako. This place has Fish Katsu and I was like o_O OMG, it was heaven to just have it on the  menu and even a higher place in heaven was the taste. Their Sashimi that you can get in the AYCE was delicious as well. Too bad it was only 1 order per person.  Now to the \"negatives\".  1.They seem to focus too much on making sure you only ordered the \"1 order per person\" once, that when my brother ordered the 2 sashimi orders (for him and his daughter, I went to order it and she said we already had two orders. I said \"we have 4 people\". And when my brother ordered the fresh oysters for me, because he doesn't like it, he was worried they would see me eat it. I hope they don't trip about that because we paid for 4 AYCE so no matter who eats the 1 order per person stuff, we can get 4 orders. So don't trip on little things like that for the price we're paying.  2. I know it was a little busy but if you're gonna put a time limit, you should make sure you're  fully staffed enough so people can get their orders in. There was a point in time neither of us 4 had any food to eat LOL. First world problems, I know..but still...Time is money.  All in all, I'd go again. I'd probably just sit at a table next time, since I really just like sitting at the bar if we can order directly from the chef. You don't really do that here. Okay bye.",

    "text": "ITS AYCE - so one must withhold their usual sushi quality expectations.   But with that said - I haven't been this disappointed with an AYCE sushi restaurant in a long, long time.  The sashimi just was NOT fresh. Whether it was the salmon, tuna, ono, yellowtail, uni, or the sweet shrimp - all you can taste is the FISHINESS of everything. The rice was huge, the quality was poor, and to top it off wreak of fishiness.  After my first round of sashimi, I was so turned off by their nigiri I ended up ordering hot food instead in fear of food poisoning.  The only thing Umiya has going for them is that their service was very attentive.   But even that was then undid when I had to experience the horrendousness of sitting at the bar and watching their kitchen staff grounding up raw salmon and tuna like it was ground beef. No reputable sushi restaurant should be treating precious sashimi that way.",

Not the best ive had but certainly good enough to visit again.",

And the table they had was a good size for ayce.  The menu had a variety and not just sushi and sashimi. They had filet mignon, oyster shooters, ramen, udon, miso soup, and of course all the other sushi you would find at a sushi joint! The fish were fresh and the rolls they made are a good size. They also have a full bar.  Last but not least, they had ice cream and mochi ice cream! I'm a dessert person, so I always make room for dessert! You gotta check out the green tea mochi ice cream!   The waiters were very friendly and always checked in on you. They always come back to fill up your water.  I would come back again the next time I'm in Vegas. This is my new spot and I'll definitely come by and bring some friends for good times and good eats!",

    "text": "In this review tried some new items that never had before because really the menu is that extensive never going too fit all in. Why would you? Each visit can be all its own going with more little side dishes plus sushi, all sushi, some ramen or udon and sushi. Endlesssss. I wanted too try the ramen on the menu. It on point tasty and delicious like everything else on the menu! The broth such nice depth of flavor unique taste unlike other True ramen restaurants. It little less salty then other places, the noodles solid, and AYCE just the right size portion have room for other stuff.   Sushi Chef Alex is awesome. I was able too try some stuff not even on the AYCE menu. I had the black sea bass nigiri style, fresh eel (he showed me fresh eel; ever since my experience at Yummy feel sushi chef presents the fish see that quality adds personal touch) that never had before amazing, and even more AMAZING thing was the fresh Umi. Unfortunately again not on the AYCE but presented fresh UMI then he literally cut it open served order a la carte another table but kind enough make me one nigiri. Wow! If could get that kind of fresh Umi I would kill the whole population of Umi. Lol! Lunch is never that crowded really one of the best times too go. Truly one of my best sushi experience one that not only truly feel sushi chef Alex passion for sushi, the attention too service is on point (never have empty glass of soda or water), and all sushi chefs are easy too talk stories with just makes it that much more enjoyable. I can not give Chef Alex enough stars because every time I have gone in he shows passion for sushi, bringing in different fish, and makes sure you have the best sushi experience. On my last visit I took my brother and his family Umiya first time. Chef Alex came around the sushi bar say Hello, check up, and if anything else we needed or wanted too try. It that kind of service that almost lost art in this day and age of culinary scene or big names. The only bummer is they no longer do all you can drink. It buy two get the third one free. I go Umiya for the food not so much drinking. It not missed too much.",

They offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??    This location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.    Sushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.      I was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.    Service was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.",

Sitting at the bar, you get a feel for the chefs and their sushi-styling. I mainly ordered nigiri and side dishes from the kitchen. The ratio of fish-to-rice was decent enough, however I felt that the rice was over seasoned to the point that it hindered the delicate nature of some of the fish. My friend seemed to like it though. For the side dishes, the servers helped us as best as they could. I went through most items, requesting gluten-free if possible so that my friend could try.  The chefs were very accommodating for my gluten-free friend. They even checked all their ingredients / packaging for hidden wheat. It was then that we all found out that the masago unfortunately had wheat in it.",

    "text": "You gotta get here just to see the Alex/Pete/Eric Show, it's crazy! The sushi chefs are just one amazing thing about this place. You will love all of the reasons, though, I promise!  First, the menu is EX-TEN-SIVE. For an AYCE place to have this many choices (granted, some are 1X only) is mind-blowing. From the nigiri, to the appetizers, right on down to the mochi, you will be hoping for a second stomach by the time all is said and done. I certainly needed one!  I made the mistake of filling up on rolls instead of the fresh fish, I won't do that again. The albacore, salmon, oysters, filet, pork, octopus, whatever you want, it's delicious! The rolls were awesome too, but with such a huge selection you'll do better to keep those to a minimum.   I did happen to ask for their hottest roll and they made one up that is now named after me (yeah, right). It was hot, spicy and delicious. I'm sorry, I ate so much last night I forgot what was in it, but I'm pretty sure it was basically seafood and avocado dipped in hot ass sauce. Whew!  The service was superb. I didn't wait for drinks or food for very long at all. I loved it! The place is also beautiful and big so bring a party, you'll enjoy the heck out of it!  I'm headed back in a few months once all this sushi is digested. Wow, ate so much. Enjoy!",

Service was good and the hosts were very attentive to us.   When the first 5 rolls we ordered came out, I immediately stuffed my face with food as fast as I could. I think that wasn't a good idea because by the time we got to the last 3-4 plates, I was just eating the rolls in avoidance of getting charged, and everything just started to not taste pleasant anymore. But at least we managed to try 16 different rolls off the menu.  Word of advice: Order half rolls!!!! Gives you the opportunity to taste different things off the menu and knit pick which ones are your favorites. I think my favorite rolls had to be the sunset roll, shrimp tempura roll, and Snow White roll. on the other hand, I really liked the chicken katsu roll. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely hit this place up again if I'm ever craving for sushi.",

Tried nearly every raw fish but only thing I would avoid is the mackerel. It needed more acid, it's a very oily fish.   My biggest problem was the warm oysters. Not feeling sick yet.   Also try the yuzu! Ceviche is a nice touch",

I had gone with a group of my boys from college, trying to satisfy our late night sushi cravings!  We were sat right away and started off ordering the load of nigiri. I think our first order was 10 Hamachi, 5 sake, 5 maguro.  When I go out for sushi I don't mess around! The thing I loved most about this place was that the nigiri came with small portions of the rice and a good sized slice of sashimi on top.  The sake (salmon) was oh so good! melt in your mouth kind of fish.  They also had many great appetizers to choose from my favorite had to be the either the fried soft shell crab and baked mussels, literally heaven!  The staff was great, our waitress was funny and even cracked jokes with us during the night which I always like seeing.  The only con I have about this place is that when i ordered my uni is tasted a little frozen not as fresh as the other places I have around Vegas.    But for the most part I enjoyed this place very much and will definitely be back for another round at Umiya :)",

    "text": "Glad I found this place on Instagram! Me and my friends came here after cruising around Fremont St. after midnight. They open until 2am, so my first impression would be that the food won't be fresh and that they would be rushing us to get out of there, lack of service. I was totally wrong!! We came and opt for the AYCE and the owner (I think) said they stopped taking orders around 1:20am so we were okay with that. We were seated and I ordered whatever that caught my attention to ensure I got to try everything before the cut off time. Everything was made to order and served in little platters one by one and everything was delicious!! They limit certain dishes to one at a time which is good because I would've just ordered probably 3 plates of everything because my eyes are bigger than my stomach! They have ramen, steak, teriyaki, nigiri, tempura, appetizers, dessert, grilled fish, etc! It's about $27 per person after tax and it is definitely worth it. Also, free soda with Yelp check in. Everything was nice, hot and fresh except for the uni, which was so bad you can see it in the color but it was okay because it was near closing so I skipped it. I especially like the fresh oysters and the spicy tuna over crispy rice! Felt bad I couldn't finish some items because I was so full and I read that if you don't finish your food, you will be charged for it! I got scared so I forced myself to it but the owner was really nice, she brought out the check and didn't charge us for it and not only did her and her employees didn't make us feel rushed or bad we came in late but they were really friendly! I definitely recommend this place to my friends and I will of course be back!",

    "text": "I wanted to try a new sushi spot for AYCE sushi and this place popped it. Boy did I strike gold! I am so glad that I came across this place. I usually frequent Sushi House Goyemon whenever I have that sushi craving but this one is up there with it. There are somethings that are done better here than over there and vice versa but Umiya was a pleasant surprise. They have a huge selection and have a 90 minute time limit.  Highlights: Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - OMG can I say that this was one of the best crispy rice and spicy tuna combos I have ever had. The rice was perfectly crispy and didn't overwhelm the spicy tuna. The Spicy tuna was perfect and had the right taste - I could taste the freshness of the fish.  I had two orders of these because they were THAT good.  Nigiri, Salmon and albacore - the fish was super fresh and exactly what I expected. They didn't overdo the rice like they do at other places so I am thankful for that.   Agedashi Tofu - THE BEST AGEDASHI TOFU I'VE EVER HAD. Yes, I had to put that in all caps to emphasize how good it was. I had 4 orders. You heard that correctly. I know this is a sushi place but they do all of their other non-sushi dishes so well! The broth was delicious and the batter was light and crispy while the tofu was silken and melted in my mouth.  Spicy Tuna Salad - large chunks of tuna in a spicy sauce mix. Delicious! Too bad you can only order 1 of these per person.  The only negative thing I would have to say about this place is that they have more dishes that are only 1 per person (desserts, some sushi items, etc) than Goyemon and that they don't do half rolls (so I can't try as many rolls as I would if I were to go to Goyemon). Other than that, they are on par with other AYCE sushi places and I will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "There's many AYCE in town and you gotta standout to get noticed. A few things going for them off the bat - right by the strip ( off Flamingo in the strip mall by the Palms casino) so easy for industry folks and tourist to hit up, it's nicely decorated, open late until 2am daily and the menu selection is large and offering unique items other spots do not in terms of appetizers. Probably a good place to take folks who aren't sushi people when you want to eat sushi yet try to still meet them halfway.   Appetizers  Screaming O Salad - seared salmon (or tuna - your choice) with spicy ponzu, mayo, shredded daikon, mixed greens - decent but I think I prefer without the greens which is how most places do it. Oysters - it was a  briny varietal probably from SoCal waters so I'm not a fan. Tuna sashimi w/ AJ sauce - good but only 2pcs  Grilled Yellowtail collar - awesome! one of my favorite things, but most places you can only order one whereas there isn't a order limit here!  Soft Shell Crab - another favorite and theirs were lightly battered but crisp and with a tiny bit of Japanese mustard sauce on top.  Bacon wrapped scallop skewer - reminds me of bacon wrapped dates as the sauce had that similar sweet flavor about it  spicy rice cake skewer - crisp outside and chewy inside, the way I prefer my dokbokki Crispy rice with spicy tuna - these were large compared to other places and came 4 to a order!  Pork belly - pretty good and base. It's thin slices and grilled like KBBQ, not roasted in a big hunk and then sliced.  Nigiri  There are daily specials so ask a server or look at the small glowing board on the left wall of the sushi bar. The specials today were sea bream which was fresh and really good, spanish mackerel which was decent though I thought maybe the sauce was slightly too sweet for it, giant clam which was crunchy in a surprising way and I like the thin slice of nori on it. Super white - pretty fresh here!  Seared Salmon - more like peppered style than a fresh torch like some bars do. I liked it and enjoyed the flavor of the pepper and ponzu sauce.  Peppered Albacore - this was good, but thought the seared salmon was better. Yellowtail - this was just OK, had a different flavor about it. Don't know how to describe, just different and the BF didn't like it.  Tuna - acceptable level of freshness, but nothing outstanding.  Masago - good, but I don't know when masago is ever bad.  Uni - pretty fresh and was sweet so I was pleased. Mackerel - not a salty nor vinegary brine to this so I wonder if it was cured at all? It was fresh though, but not what I'm accustomed to.   Sushi  Snow White - this is the BFs favorite roll elsewhere and I think it's better made here. It's spicy diced up soft shell crab, avocado topped with super white tuna that's been torched and then Japanese mustard sauce.  Salmon Skin Hand Roll - it wasn't crispy enough so it wasn't too pleasing to have a few bites with chewy skin bits.   Rice to fish ratio here was very good, more fish than there is rice for sure. No roll half orders except for one per person here. Like always, stuff like uni and specials are one per person as well.   Dessert is included. and we got a mochi and a tempura green ice cream.  Service  The service was very nice. We had a male server that checked on us and was super friendly explaining everything. We also had a female server that took our initial orders and also often brought us plates. The sushi bar was also friendly and asked if everything was tasting right and how was our experience at the end of the meal. It's evident that they do care about the customer, which is hugely appreciated by me.   I don't think they have a stamp card, at least non was offered to us.  Overall, this was a solid inaugural visit. I think it has a lot of good things going for it so I'm sure I'll be back. I don't think it tops my favorite spot, but I think it's good to put into the rotation.",

    "text": "This sushi restaurant has such good quality food I mean it's open late and it's never that busy so you can be seated right away and get your food fast! Unlike goyemon ugh literally I'd have to wait like 30-40 mins every single time I go to goyemon and honestly their food isn't that great of quality I mean their mussels are kinda nasty. This is the first sushi restaurant in Vegas where their mussels were so delicious I finished the whole thing. Their rolls are pretty dang good too. They even have a check in that gives you one free soda and they allowed us to get lemonade for it so that was pretty amazing too. I came here just because goyemons wait was like 30-40 mins and umiya was not busy at all, their price for all you can eat is $25 and a few rolls can fill you up quickly plus their fish was so fresh so good. Plus the portions are a bit bigger too. I loved it. I mean next time I'm coming here to eat I don't know why goyemons so hyped this place is the place you should go. definitely coming back here again",

Oh well, on to the rest of the food.....if it is on the specials board, you need to try the salmon belly nigiri and yuzu hamachi. The rolls were ok, and the hot and cold apps are the norm of what you get at other AYCE suchi places. We may give this place another chance but there are other AYCE sushi places out there that are better.",

The quality of the fish is top notch, and I have never seen such an extensive AYCE menu, for $25.95 for dinner, it is an INCREDIBLE deal! They don't pile on the rice for filler, we were each able to try several dishes, including three unique specials! All three were fish I had never tried, and were delicious! I usually base my opinion of the quality of a place on their saba, uni and fresh oysters- these all taste bad when improperly handled, or not fresh, but Umiya nailed all three, they were perfect!!  This is definitely my new spot for sushi, and it is more centrally located than my previous faves too! Parking is really easy, and even though the place looked fairly packed the food came out FAST with no mistakes! All three of us were incredibly impressed, and would recommend Umiya to anyone!!",

Each sushi is thinly cut but at least the rice isn't overly too much. I wish the rice had more vinegar in it and softer. The sushi rice was cold and tasteless.   Service was pretty much on top of things and orders were made quite fast. There were like six Korean guys behind the counter making every sushi order.   The place had TV's so you can be in there watching the game. They give you 90 minutes to eat as much as possible.   For the bang for the buck it's cheaper than the casinos and they have a good variety of items to eat.",

We feared the long lines and wait we had read about in other reviews and when we called they warned of a 1-2 hour wait. However, when we arrived we were seated in mere minutes.  The fish quality and really food quality overall is pretty surprisingly good for AYCE. One thing that really stands out is the variety of their menu. It is rare that an AYCE place lets you order shucked oysters, rib eye, and ramen/udon in addition to everything else on the menu.  Service is also tremendous here. They gave us a wrong order or an extra portion but quickly remedied the issue. They are also constantly available to take your orders and the food comes out so fast.   The Yelp-check-in deals gets you a free drink which is always nice. Overall, I remember the yellowtail and albacore being especially impressive. The rice to fish ratio is definitely in the customer's favor. Easily my new favorite AYCE place in Vegas.",

It gives the place a romantic vibe.   I came on a Friday around 4:00pm and it was dead. Which I liked because from the reviews I really thought it was going to be a busy.   I ordered a few of the popular rolls such as: King of the ocean, Kiss of fire, First kiss, sunset, sunrise, rainbow, firecracker, etc. also ordered a bunch of nigiri.   I honestly wasn't too impressed with the fish. It wasn't as fresh as I would have hoped. And the flavors didn't go as well either. There was one roll I got called Seafood Volcano Roll and it was a bit of a mess. There was a lot of things going on with it. It had mushrooms which I thought was a bit out of the ordinary but didn't go very well with the fish.   I ordered a spicy seafood salad, which I thought was really good. It had a lot of fish in it and the dressing was just right. They have a variety of mochi ice cream flavors which was appreciated but of course it is just 1 order per person. I tried their plum wine flavored ice cream which I really thought was delicious!   Service was great. Staff was nice and attentive. Goyemon is still my #1 AYCE.",

    "text": "In this city of sushi bars galore, finding a good one can be tough. In the past, I had two favorites. One of which (whose name I can't even remember) was in The Lakes area and closed many years ago. The other one, Kobe, I have since moved too far away from to justify making the hike for AYCE lunch. For all I know, it could end up being dinner by the time I get there from where I currently live.   So, the hunt began for me to find a new sushi joint. I've heard many sing the praises of Yama. I wasn't impressed. Sushi-Mon? Overrated. Ra Sushi? Decent rolls, obnoxiously clubby and trendy atmosphere coupled with high prices and the lack of AYCE. I learned that many of the no-name joints where the main sign literally just says \"sushi\" are like that for a reason. Sushi 21 was my main go-to for a while, and it was pretty decent, but that's it. Nothing mind-blowing. Eager to have sushi but wanting something mind-blowing, I was led to try this place.  Yes. This place is pretty mind-blowing indeed. It actually blows my prior two faves out of the water.  Located in a strip mall that appears to be slowly becoming Little Tokyo due to all the Japanese-related businesses popping up, it is a space that is fairly large but still maintains a degree of intimacy. The music is noticeable, but not TOO noticeable. The servers are attentive and friendly.   As for the menu? Probably the most extensive AYCE menu I've ever seen. For starters (no pun intended), the list of appetizers is so long that it takes up a whole page. I've never seen that before. There's also some very creative rolls indeed. A chicken katsu roll? Again: Mind. Blown.  Everything came out quite fast, with the pork belly being sizzling hot and the right balance of tough and tender. The chicken katsu being tiny in the most satisfying way possible. Their eel sauce was off the chain. The lobster roll was a bit messy, but that's easily forgiven. I mean, it's chunk lobster meat after all.   The Final Verdict:  Pros: Great ambiance and dining setting. Large AYCE menu at a decent price (20.95 for Lunch) Copious amounts of appetizers on the AYCE menu. Fresh, flavorful and creative rolls.  Cons: Messy lobster roll....but this is minor.  Yum-yum sauce and japanese-style mayo seemed to be everywhere.  Suggestions: Lay off the Japanese mayo please.  Return Factor: 10/10. Already planning on it.",

We were greeted warmly and with a smile which is always a good start to your meal. They have picnic tables in the larger eating areas for those large groups coming for good sushi. With smaller tables scattered about the main dining floor is not to cluttered. We were lucky we got to sit towards the back in one of there rooms that was portioned off by curtains. Our section had two tables it was perfect. We arrived at 6:30 and it was not crazy busy on Saturday, but it got busier when we left at 8. Our waitress was a very polite young lady who took care of us really well. My apologies I for got her name.   The sushi was delicious, period! AYCE for $26 was a great deal. You are always kinda skeptical when you see AYCE sushi for such a great price. We were happily surprised with the quality and portions. Most of our meal we did the half portions which is a good option if you want to try a little bit of everything. After our waitress took our drink orders it was on. Mom & Steph ordered the yuzu drink and loved it so much. We started our first round off with 2 orders of monkey brains, 2 orders of Japanese lasagne, 4 orders yellow tail, 2 orders unagi, 1 order spicy scallop. All was amazing! Portions and sushi on the smaller side but good cause you can eat all kinds of different types of sushi. Second round was more Japanese lasagne 2, 4 yellow tail, 2 maguro, one order each of the rice-less sushi which was different but good, crunchy scallop roll 1. Third round was more yellowtail, maguro, mom got an udon and that was it. We threw in the towel. An amazing meal and a wonderful dining experience. Thank you to the staff at Umiya Sushi on flamingo! We will definitely be back.",

They have such unique sushi combinations that really amazed me. I've tried so many different restaurants in Vegas and this is by far THE best place.       To start off the pricing is just like other AYCE sushi places - $25.00 using yelp you also get a free soda!        The staffs gotta be the best as well since you basically don't get one specific server and all the servers work together which isn't something you'll see everyday. They had a really large number of staff which makes it so much more efficient! All the staffs are super super friendly and surprisingly knows the menu by heart and knows what they have in the sushi and what not (really trained). I still can't wrap my head around at the fact that the sushi was so fresh and extraordinarily and that the staffs service was amazing.      The banana roll was my favorite - a great example Of whacky unique flavors that works so well together. You also get ramen/udon to choose from and some yummy appetizers! Mushroom boy was really strange and good too! I'll def be coming back here this is such a good professional place and the food is literally to die for! Thank you!!!!",

FRIENDLY people constantly refilled our drinks (alcoholic and otherwise), cleared dishes, asked us (at appropriate and non-annoying times) if we needed anything, etc. The sushi chefs were also incredibly diligent; we never had to wait or catch their eye to order, and the rolls came out consistently quickly.   Additionally, they are the only sushi restaurant I've visited in both Vegas and Reno (places in which I've lived for 14 years now, so I've visited quite a few) that allows you to order a huge selection of rolls as half rolls. This may seem like a minor point, but it's a HUGE deal when you've never been to a restaurant before and want to try out several different rolls before your \"sushi coma\" begins.  They ALSO allowed you to order more than one appetizer with an all-you-can-eat meal! I'm almost certain I've NEVER seen this before at the 20+ sushi restaurants I've visited in Nevada. Fantastic.   The restaurant was clean and spacious, and they actually space people out at the bar in spite of the restaurant being busy. Well done, Umiya!   Check out the Green Chili Tempura roll, as it was excellent!",

Two people asked us if we wanted anything to drink and that was it. A chef took notice of us and personally took our order. It took about 30 minutes for one of our orders to finally come, and at this point my husband wants to leave because I had work in a few hours. Our appetizers came last and it was difficult to get another order in. The chef was now super busy and he's the one who took our order to begin with. My husband wasn't happy so we asked for the check and that took another 15 minutes. It wasn't worth the money we paid. The food wasn't that great, we've had way better. Not looking forward to giving this place another try.  If you're tight on time, this isn't the place. As a server myself I felt like this place didn't really care if their customers were unhappy. I still left a $15 tip, and my husband said I shouldn't because we didn't even get to finish eating. But I didn't want to stiff them, I know how that feels. They need to be more organized. Other tables had multiple servers asking them if they needed anything and they were told that the other server already helped them. I've taken a liking to Sakana. Busy, but we're always taken care of.",

Asked if I can have a side of yuzu (because I get it every time I go there) and rudely says \"no you can't.\" I'm a server myself and I was always trained to say I'm sorry but we don't have that available. Asked we could have our edamame seared a little extra and again he said no you can't because we cook it in large batches not just for one table at a time. The food has always been great but this guy was just so rude that he really ruined our meal. Won't be coming back unfortunately.",

    "text": "I tried Umiya during my recent visit to Vegas since it was close to my hotel. The restaurant is about a mile off the strip, across the street from Palms Place.  Upon entering, the sushi chefs shout out 'Hello' and 'Welcome' greetings in Korean. In the background, there are TVs with PSY music videos playing on repeat (Gangnam style and Gentleman). Kind of strange to be in a Korean environment while eating Japanese sushi, but if you focus on the food, the awkwardness can be filtered out.  Umiya carries a similar menu to other Vegas AYCE sushi restaurants. For example, tuna, albacore, super white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, red snapper, shrimp, eel, mackerel, etc are on the sushi list. However, Umiya distinguishes itself from the pack by offering premium sushi. There are 3 daily specials of high quality fish. During my visit, they were spanish mackerel, giant clam, and striped bass. Sometimes, the specials may include sea bream and giant scallop. These varieties are rarely found in common AYCE sushi lists. On top of that, there were oysters, uni, and ama-ebi. All of the premium and special items have a limit of 1 order, but it was not really enforced since order forms and records were not used.   The oysters, uni, spanish mackerel, and halibut were my favorites. The quality and freshness of the fish were invariably excellent. Fish were cut thick, characteristic of the Korean preference. Unfortunately, the presentation was sometimes poor. Sauces were overapplied to the fish at times, resulting in sauce overflowing onto the plate and rice. A carefully-crafted piece of nigiri should not have ponzu or soy sauce staining the rice before it reaches the consumer. This is a common occurrence in Korean sushi restaurants.  Organization was another issue that I encountered. Umiya did not utilize order forms at the bar. Each customer is expected to order in front of a chef. Unfortunately, the chefs could not handle large orders. I tried making 10 orders at once but he was overwhelmed and could only remember 4 to 6 at a time. When the restaurant filled up halfway during our meal, I was neglected for over 30 minutes in favor of the new diners. An order form might be useful for Umiya to implement in the future.  Aside from the aforementioned issues, Umiya is still phenomenal for the price. $25 for unlimited decent seafood with premium options is an exceptional deal. This is perfect for those who are hungry, seeking a budget sushi restaurant in Vegas, and can sacrifice a little bit of quality. I am already anticipating a visit to Umiya during my next visit to Vegas.",

We decided on Umiya since it was close to our hotel and very reasonably priced for AYCE.  We got there at 6 pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. The space itself is really pretty and open. We got drinks and our first orders in within a couple of minutes of being seated. Our rolls came super quickly, which continued throughout our meal, despite the restaurant getting much busier. Those familiar with AYCE know how important superfast ordering and delivery are!  The food was completely decent. The rolls themselves are on the small side, but very light on rice. I really liked the size, since each one takes up less belly real estate, so you can try more tasty things! The fish quality is average, depending on the roll (the salmon and ahi were great; the super white tuna was meh). As with a lot of sushi places with huge menus, the sauces on the rolls can be their downfall. There are many that come with spicy mayo, but they're easily avoided.   The AYCE menu is enormous. There are lots of fresh, fried and baked rolls, plus nigiri, various non-fish items and dessert. It's $27 per person for dinner, with a HUGE 90 minute time limit. Umiya is definitely our new go-to on this side of town!",

He basically said it was comparable to Kabuto, but less expensive. Boy, was he right. The AYCE selection is better than any other place in town and the dinner was $26.95 a person. The service was happy, and not snooty or too busy, even when it was. The seating was a bit more BBQ house type, but in all honesty, this did not matter to me. The sushi was fresh, the oysters were soooo good. It made me rethink Shuck's oysters and their quality.  The bill was not split correctly, so double check as you should anywhere else, and head to this sushi house. The orange blossom and other rolls are good to try, but the nigiri is so good. Especially for being in the desert. Reason for the 4 stars? We had to remind them 3 times about our oysters and uni. Sorry Umiya!",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this location tucked in a shopping plaza off of Flamingo and Arville, across from Palms Hotel and Casino.   Is there anything better than taking a chance on a restaurant and finding a hidden gem that could become an absolutely favorite?!?!  By far one of the largest AYCE menu selections. Although some of the selections are a 1x order only it's an absolute must try!   The staff was friendly and attentive. When my gf and I ordered the food came out rather quickly. The seafood salad was absolutely yummy!  The decor is beautifully understated. Long tables with wooden benches. Not the average sushi spot with tables. Great place for groups!   $25.99 for an AYCE. After dinner for two and two drinks we walked out completely stuffed with sushi and mochi ice cream about an hour and a half later bringing our total to $62.59.",

My boyfriend and I  certainly walked into quite a gem!    The wait staff warmly greeted us, great customer service!  We ordered 28 different items from the AYCE menu and EVERYTHING was absolutely quality, great tasting, and fresh, fresh, fresh!  Wow!!!!!!  We savored every bite!  The wide selection from the AYCE menu was amazing.  What a great variety.    Great atmosphere, staff, food, experience!!!! THANK YOU UMIYA!  Definitely,  our new hot spot when we come to town.",

    "text": "It was little hard to find this place we were at the right parking lot but we couldn't see the sign(Actually there's no sign yet only little banner saying UMIYA all you can eat sushi coming soon) so we used my navigation on my smartphone. But we ended up at the same parking lot as first time??? This time we paid more attention, UMIYA is right next door of Starbucks. It looks small from outside but inside is very modern and upscale looking. I was very surprised by the quality of foods for AYCE sushi place. Food was fantastic, me and my husband was so busy to eat to take any pictures. When we realized we were only able to take two pictures. We really liked everything we ordered. Orange blossom roll, The bacon wrapped scallop skewer, Marinated Pork Belly, Baby Octopus skewer, Fresh Oyster, Crunch lobster Roll( plenty of real lobster)....I can't remember any more but all was so good.  I highly recommend this place to anyone love sushi but don't eat AYCE sushi because the poor quality of food @most of AYCE sushi places.  UMIYA is Only High Quality AYCE sushi place in Las Vegas.  I can't wait for next time.",

Our server was rude and uninformative. When I was done and ready to leave I had to ask for the check three times. Then instead of having one charge for left overs they charged every single roll that had left overs.  I waited at lest 20 minutes just for my check. Everything was very slow and the atmosphere wasn't enjoyable.",

    "text": "I've never been much of a sushi eater, but my brother loves it, and the last couple times he's been in Vegas we've gone here for lunch. I prefer the cooked tempura, and he prefers the raw stuff. During our last visit I had the lobster crunch roll, the Lisa Lisa, and something that I think was called an Orange Crush. (It was with salmon, I think). All three were good, especially the lobster roll. It was topped with a cream sauce that was irresistible, and my brother was equally impressed with his choices. (I can't remember what they were, but I know one was topped with raw tuna.) Both times we've come here the service has been excellent, and the atmosphere nice. (They play a music video channel on their big screen TV, and it's piped through the restaurant's sound system. It's loud but not loud enough that you can't have a nice quiet conversation at your table.)",

Lots of people working so the waitress was very attentive and the orders came in fast. All you can eat is not a buffet but instead you order as you wish a couple of things at a time, even 1/2 rolls if you want to try lots of stuff. Awesome. Would come back again.",

LOL jk. just about tho.. my favorite rolls were the SALMON KILLER, SNOW WHITE,  and u must try the seared ahi tuna with AJ special sauce... that was bomb!  there wasnt one thing that i ordered that wasnt good.... i give this place an A+!! so far...
