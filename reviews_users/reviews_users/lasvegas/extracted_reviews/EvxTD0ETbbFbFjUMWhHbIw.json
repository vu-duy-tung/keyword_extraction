The first time I had curry from this place, which was about 6 months or so ago, the curry had a meaty, chili taste, but this time it was spot on with how I think Japanese curry should taste.  Food prices are reasonable, comparing to other curry places I have been.",

He made sure to check on us during our meal and would ask if the food was good.

There was a lot of oniony flavor to the curry.  The meat was fried just right.  I like the fries which you can dip in curry.  If you like over-processed fast food fries, you won't like these fries.

    "text": "WHY: WOOHOOO!! There is finally a Japanese curry place on the East Side!! THAT'S WHY! =D  WHO: Bring your entire family!! I believe they do a free meal for kids if you eat there (check me on how many kids though, lol).  WHEN: Monday through Saturday they are open from noon-9pm, Sundays from noon to 8pm.  WHERE: In the small plaza on the corner of Nellis & Stewart (right beside Shell gas station).  WHAT: First and foremost... Can I get a HALLELUJAH?!  I am so thankful that this Cute Curry Cafe (you like that alliteration, don't you? Lol) opened right down the street from my house!! (because I randomly have curry cravings).   Japanese curry is a fusion of different spices from Asia, and is certainly delicious and Tasty! It comes in three levels of spiciness: Mild, Regular, & Hot. There are different combos such as Tonkatsu (Pork cutlet) curry, Vegetable with curry, chicken with curry, and you can even request their fried chicken with curry. Whatever you choose is a good choice, but I personally recommend the Tonkatsu curry! It is just worth your TIME AND MONEY!  On the dessert end, they have an Orange jello called the \"Orange Dream\" topped with whipped cream. NOTE** If you're curious and willing to try, they have this BOMB.ORG coffee jello topped with whipped cream. It's not on the menu yet, but ASK FOR IT! It is absolutely REFRESHING!  & If the curry, rice & your choice combo doesn't seem to suffice your TUMMY, try the french fries with curry, or the fried chicken with curry, where the curry acts as a dipping sauce.   Decor-wise walking in, it is bright orange and definitely brightens my mood! It is a peaceful place to eat, and the employees are absolute darlings! It will definitely become my second home soon. =X hahaha.  Random: A few days ago I chose to bring one of my friends here, and it was the perfect timing because the owner happened to be there! =) He is such a friendly Japanese man who is all SMILES! I got to chat with him a bit and SECRET... he is going to start serving CURRY UDON! That I am freaking excited for! CURRY ON NOODLES?! WHO COULD REFUSE?! - I CAN'T!  So come down to the East, and take a look-see, you will definitely enjoy it! Try the coffee jello, and I will fill you all in when Curry Udon is up on the menu!   =D SMILES!",

It was a really good decision ! The owner gave us a warm welcome and was really friendly and talkative with us. The curry is amazing ! The gravy is thick and give this warm feeling that curry should have.

You can get the chicken either fried or grilled/lightly pan fried and I opted for the latter. The meal took about 20 minutes and was a bit of a long wait as the waitress said she got the orders mixed up and had to redo them. They did give us a free dessert to apologize for the wait and I thought that was a nice gesture. The curry itself isn't really comparable to some of the curry joints in town, but it is a nice quick drive when I want my Japanese curry fixed. I just wished they had some pickled stuff to go on my curry like the other restaurants in town.  Service is nice and prices are pretty good on the pocket. I'll be back when I'm craving and don't want to drive to China town. Hopefully they get more menu items and condiments to match in order to up the east side curry game and keep me really coming back for me.. we'll see!",

Also, their to go menu has a couple of coupons to use on future visits.   Food - I ordered the chicken cutlet and added veggies, which is a sauteed mix of red peppers, zucchini and yellow squash. I ordered it medium spicy, which wasn't spicy imho, but, a few shakes of dry spice and the heat was perfect. The chicken cutlet was fried perfectly. I'm not a curry expert, but I loved the flavor  Service - I happened to catch the owner, Hide, manning the counter and it was spot on. He even gave me a free side of pickles, which was appreciated.   Cleanliness - Super clean! A proudly posted.   Value - This place has yuuuugge portions and is super cheap when compared to other curry spots.   In all....

    "text": "So I've been thinking about coming to this place for a while now...  Living on the other side of town, there's another Japanese curry place that is more convenient to get to, but is definitely not as authentic.  I ordered the hot curry and it was just like I was back in Japan, wandering around Tokyo Station when I was a kid. Curry rice was a staple for me when I was there, as when I was younger I didn't really care for grilled fish and sushi which seemed to be everywhere. While there are other places which sell Japanese curry here in town, none of them have the flavor that this one does.  The owner is very friendly, and says he is from Tokyo.  It shows in his curry, as it tastes just like it should.   If you're close by and have never tried Japanese curry, definitely stop in and have some. The prices are good for the portion size and the service is great. Even if you're nowhere close, and you want to know what REAL Japanese curry tastes like, it's definitely worth the drive. They also have delivery with BiteLV & Uber Eats.  We'll be coming back!!",

They're great at helping you figure out what you might like if it's your first time with Japanese curry (my first with any form of curry). If you're dining in they bring it to your table and clean it themselves but not a waitress situation, similar to Panera bread. I try something different every time I go and have yet to try something I didn't like. Easy on the \"hot curry\" it's a slow heat that builds and will hit you half way through the meal.

    "text": "I visited Oh! Curry today while visiting my grandparents. They live in the east side of town that is heavily Hispanic so food choices tend to be limited to taquerias, fast food, diners and occasional Chinese food, so this curry house was a refreshing surprise.  We walked in and found the restaurant to be spacious and exceedingly clean. The cashier/server was immediately helpful in assisting us and wanted to help us if this had been out first curry experience. She answered all our questions (this being my grandparents first curry experience) and promptly rang is up.   We got our soft drinks from the dispenser and sat down. We observed and commented on the giant sign on the wall that explained what Japanese curry is to the customer in Spanish, which I think was a smart move on the owners part considering the location of the restaurant.  The food was served quickly on cafeteria trays. The portions are very large so expect to leave very full or take home leftovers. This is usually the case though because rice is essentially half the dish. Dude note, extra rice is free for dine-in.   We ordered tonkatsu curry, beef curry, fried chicken and French fries. The curry itself is very reminiscent of Golden Curry that you can buy out of a box, but more flavorful with different spices. I'm not usually an avid curry fan, but I really enjoyed this curry. We all got mild because we don't like spicy food.   The tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) was a little bland as in it needed salt, but otherwise moist and crunchy. The beef was sort of like roast meat, not like stew meat, but it was very tender and flavorful. I didn't try the fried chicken, but was told it was good. The breading is a thicker Japanese style, so don't expect KFC. The fries were amazing! Fresh and crunchy with great flavor. I would go back just for the fries.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and the curry. It's not quite as expensive as sit down restaurant curry (this is fast food curry). It's delicious at the right price (about $7 per dish). They have a rewards card where you buy 8 curry dishes and get one free. They offer delivery within 3 miles for $2 and a minimum $15 purchase (which is very reasonable). I look forward to visiting again the next time I am in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Play by play of the restaurant here at Stewart and nellis for oh! Curry.  The person taking our order was very pleasant and cordial. Though, she really doesn't know much about japanese curry, her hospitality and customer service makes up for it.  Ordering the curry, there's only 3 choices for the curry sauce. Regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry powder/blocks. Which in turn, makes me think that their curry sauce aren't homemade recipe unlike cocos ichibanya, or the local contenders, zen curry or kaba curry. But even if that's the case, the curry sauce was pretty good. I opted for hot only because I know the mild is almost like the regular...she let me taste the difference. I would have preferred it between mild and hot, but since that's not a choice, I have to go for hot. The scale for the choices of what they have would be regular (no spice which is 0 on the scale), mild (little spice which would have been a 2 on the scale), and hot (lots of spice which would be a 8.5 on a scale of 1 - 10). I prefer my curry to be right around 5, which would be a medium, so it's spicy but I can still taste the base stock of the curry.  As for the chicken cutlet curry that I ordered, it was nice and good. It was cooked just right. Not too dry but the breading is still nice and crispy.   Being a newly opened restaurant, relatively, they are doing a card promotion where if you have visited and ordered a curry meal, the tenth meal is free. This would drive some word of mouth, but if they want to have more presence, they need to actively promote the place.   The only reasons I'm giving oh! Curry a four star are these:  -Location. I wouldn't have known this place existed if I didn't use the walmart pass through way to get to Stewart...I really don't go to that specific walmart for obvious reasons. -Menu. They don't have a full japanese curry restaurant menu.  -Curry sauce options. There's only three choices which I have covered; regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry...which I do cook myself...but instead I use panku breading.  Other than that, this place is a great alternative if you want japanese curry when you're in the east side of town and don't feel like driving all the way to spring mountain for Zen Curry or Kaba Curry...or all the way to California for Coco's Ichibanya.",

Very reasonably priced curry with big portion of Tonkatsu or Chicken Katsu.  Per owner, they can do curry with gyoza (pot stickers) or croquette.  They have added a small side salad in a menu.  Don't forget to try coffee jello as a desert :)",

I was a little thrown off that I couldn't pay extra for snap peas because the owner was not there at the time. She did however offer samples of the curry since it was our first time.  As for the food, I felt it had good flavor but, the sizes were extremely to large. After a few bites it was to much of the same flavor and texture. Loved the potato cakes and thought they were the best part of the meal.  I gave a lower score as well due to the soft drink fountain not being fully operational. All they offered to drink were canned green tea, another soda, and bottle water. Not to mention they were out of beef by 3 pm. If you have a business I feel that you need to be 100% all the time in a competitive town such as this. I wish this place the very best and based on the reviews it has a very loyal customer base. Hopefully we caught them on a off day.",

Other thoughts: their menu is simple and straightforward by design. I suggested to the host that they might want to consider adding tofu as an option for vegetarian diners, and I got the sense they might possibly be open to it if there seemed to be demand for it from their customers.",

I'm still thinking as I'm typing, the sauce itself is an interesting flavor combination, I actually think I will end up buying the sauce by itself and add my own proteins. That is not a put down on Oh Curry, but let's face realities, for $6,99 you get a good sized portion, but it's still only $6,99 at that price point it is excellent value, but my first thought after eating it was this sauce would be great as the base for a shrimp curry, but at $6,99 there is no way they could do it..

He gave us a stamp card, and gave us 2/8 stamps with the 8th one being a free meal so we are definitely coming back! Wait time was about 10 min. and he was very informative with telling us how to eat the curry for best flavor. Would absolutely recommended people come here and try it out!",

    "text": "Yummmmmmmy.  This was the first curry place I tried when I moved to Vegas a few months ago!  You order at the counter and they serve you the food!  It was good and portions were HUGE!  The curry is definitely on the more aromatic and savory side over which really compliments the katsu well.  I ordered the combo with both pork and chicken katsu and that was definitely the way to go for first timers.  I preferred the chicken because of moisture, taste, and texture--in case you're determined to only go with one.  Also add the cheese for an extra 50 cents.  It makes the curry so much creamier.  I've never been to Japan, so I can't vouch for how \"authentic\" it is, but growing up in so-cal, I've been exposed to several curry spots, including chains from Japan.  I wouldn't quite rate it up there with my favorite places (Mitsuwa food court), but it's still good and I'd come back.  Also, when coming here, you guys have to try the coffee jello...such a refreshing, stimulating dessert to help wake you up after such a carbo-loaded food coma inducing meal.  Also, the owner was super nice.  He's helpful and sweet--he even told about what restaurants I should try around the area since there's so limited options in north Vegas.  Definitely coming back again.",

I drove 3 miles, out of my way to eat, on a Wednesday evening; I arrived at 7:44 pm. As I entered the restaurant, the owner told me he was closed.  This was 45 min before his posted closing time.  Before leaving the parking lot I rechecked his business hours. 8:30pm.   After driving out~of-my-way, for nothing, I decided to go to Jack-in-the-Box instead... saved about 7 dollars.  The moral of this story don't think this restaurant is going to stay open till their posted hours.   Go somewhere else if it's around 7:30pm. Save yourself the aggravation of a closed restaurant.  This restaurant now has 1 strike against it; Hopefully they don't strike out in the future.",

Chicken cutlet, tonkatsu, veggie, steak, tofu, grilled chicken and pork nuggets (w/ fries) pretty much sums up the menu. Then you have your add-ons (corn, gyoza, cheese, etc) and some other sides, a couple drinks and dessert. I ordered the same thing every time I went: chicken cutlet w/ hot curry, gyoza topping and a UCC green tea.  Perfect lunch/dinner. You should DEFINITELY grab some curry from here if you haven't yet.",

They have dessert option, too!  The tonkatsu curry is most often recommended in the reviews, so I opted for that with a medium heat level and the coffee jello dessert. Started with the sweets because that's just how I roll, and was surprised at the quality. Not something I'd usually like, but solid and unique. The curry though? Good-size portion for a good price. But the curry sauce that makes the dish was bland and almost flavorless. I guess I should have upped the spice, but the sauce itself should have had flavor aside from just heat, and I didn't find this to be the case.   I can't say I'd come here for curry again, and looking through some other reviews I'm not the only one underwhelmed by the curry sauce. Hope they kick it up a notch: being the only option on this side of town shouldn't be an excuse to slack off.",

After finding out about Oh Curry I fell in love. I am always catching myself eat here. The owner is very nice and courteous, he always checks up to make sure your meal is good. I get the chicken cutlet hot and a side a fries with a calpico. So good and still budget friendly. Definitely my favorite Japanese curry place in Las Vegas. Visit Hide and give it a try, it won't be your last time in, the curry is addicting!",

I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.  Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!",

They had different levels of spiciness for their curry, but I'm a wimp, so I always eat mild (which is not spicy at all).  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The owner, Hide, is also really nice.  One of the biggest things that drew me to the store, besides the curry, were the anime wall scrolls on the front windows. I feel like places like this are hard to find, and they just make me feel at home.   The only problem that I can see is that their fountain machine isn't working 100%, but it's a small detail compared to how great everything else is. :]",

The taste was alright but I could tell they were a little easy on the seasoning. The worst part was the amount of pickled radish that came with it... I love it so much but the literally gave me a pinch of it and charge for extra. I counted 5 shreds and that's tiny. Way disappointed in that.

Me and a co worker went here for lunch and the staff was very friendly, the owner was from Tokyo, so I knew the food was going to be good/authentic   I elected to get the chicken curry cutlet with an extra chicken cutlet.. I got spice level: Hot..  10-15 min later our food came out, the presentation was on point! The food was pretty good, the Hot spice level wasn't too spicy but it was enough to give you the \"sniffles\"..My only complaint is that my chicken was kind of dry!  If I am back in the area, I will give them another try..",

So to have a restaurant like Oh Curry to debut in the local area is an amazing relief to the monotony than many of us endure.     The food is amazing and sold at reasonable prices. I suggest going with the standard tonkatsu curry and venturing out from there. I guarantee you'll love it at your first bite!",

I can't exactly comment on the ambiance of the restaurant because I ordered my food to go through Eat24 so I just came in and out. From what I saw, it looked like the restaurant was pretty big and spacious.   The ordering process on Eat24 was pretty simple and when I arrived, I literally just walked in and out because everything was already ready.   I was going to give it 4 stars because they were going to charge me extra for the pickled radish (and no other curry place in town charges me for it), but the cashier just gave it to me without charge so I am content!   I ordered the pork Katsu and asked for my curry sauce to be hot. I will say that their curry sauce has a different flavor from the curry houses on spring mountain, but regardless, I still really enjoyed the taste. The hotness level was perfect for my liking and the portion was huge for what I was paying.",

Anywho we ventured another day there and it was ok. Cutlets (had pork) were good and the curry was ok, the spicy was better of the spicy and the regular. The stand out was the potato croquet, creamy and a bit sweet. Also the UCC coffee was quite pleasant. Overall a decent place, friendly staff but nothing worth driving 30 mins for.",

My husband and I recently took a trip to Okinawa, Japan for vacation  to visit friends and they introduced us to the well known awesome restaurant \"coco's curry\" and this place is just like that! Owner hide is so nice, but we did experience some of the best service and genuinely kind people in Japan so we weren't surprised by his excellent service. We got the combo pork katsu and chicken cutlet katsu which was great, curry was perfect flavor and consistency. I also ordered the side salad which had sesame dressing just like the kind we've had at coco's curry in Japan. Prices are very reasonable especially with the good size portions u get. The owner also offered us free dessert since it was our first time and they also offer military discount, just make sure to ask before they place your order. This place is kind of a drive for us from North Las Vegas but definitely worth it for our Japanese curry cravings. We'll definitely be frequent customers :)",

It's hard to to think of places to eat sometimes and this is a place I ALWAYS say yes to. The owner and staff are friendly. The food is very reasonably priced with good portions and the taste is AMAZING! If you've never tried Japanese curry, why not try the best?...you wont be disappointed.",

You can drive by it if you aren't looking for it, which is a pity because it's worth finding, which is why I'm spending so much time telling you where it's at. They are new so don't let the small number of reviews fool you, they're really good!   First of all the restaurant was spotless. The lady at the counter asked me  if I'd had Japanese curry before and let me try some. She was very friendly and helpful. Japanese curry is a little different from Indian and Asian curries, more like a rich brown gravy.  If you're sensitive to the coconut milk in the other curries try Japanese curry.  I chose the pork tonkatsu which is a breaded and fried pork cutlet with rice and gravy. It was as good as tonkatsu that I've had at other Japanese restaurants for twice the price. I also got a side order of fried chicken. It's small pieces of crispy fried chicken thighs. I paid a little over $10.00 for all of it. In fact, everything at Oh Curry was very reasonable. I look forward to trying other things at the restaurant. I hope that they make  it.",

    "text": "Great place to get curry on the east side of town. Katherine O. was right, this is a diamond in the rough considering it's mainly taquerias and mainstream fast food joints in the area. So I've been wanting to try them since I was assigned to work a location in this area for 3 months. My 3 months was over so I finally decided to have lunch here on my last day. I called ahead of time so it would be ready by the time I got there. When I arrived I still had to wait a minute or two which was fine with me. When it was ready it was in a to-go container and the cashier/expediter explained that the curry sauce gets thick and to add a little bit water after an hour. However, little did she know I was going to eat it right then and there. I had the combination which is half tonkatsu and chicken katsu. The texture was great and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the pork or chicken, so I would get the chicken since it's supposed to be better for you anyway vs. pork. I had the mild curry because I am weak sauce, but it was a good almost thick consistency. I absolutely love it on the rice more so than the chicken/pork because the breading gets a tad bit soggy. I tried the radish on the side, which is a nice crunch but I didn't really taste anything. The inside of this place is very clean and the menu is pretty big with pictures. On the side of the menu there's a explanation of what curry is in Japan, the funny part is there was also a Spanish translation- that's how you know you're on the east side is when there's a Spanish translation even for something Asian. Overall great experience, I probably won't be back because I am never on the side of town, but for all you curry lovers who live here you won't have to travel all the way to China town anymore for your curry fix.",

There are two other Japanese Curry restaurants in Las Vegas but you have to go to China Town to eat there.  The food was great (I ordered the chicken cutlet with cheese) and reminded me of Coco Ichibanya in Okinawa but better!  The food portions are much larger than Kaba Curry and Zen Curry.  The restaurant is also way bigger.  The location is kind of off to the side so just look out for it.    The service was great and they offered plenty of coupons and everything was reasonably priced.  Food came out pretty quickly and the owner came out and was very friendly and spoke to us as well.",

The curry itself is authentic japanese curry with its own recipe I haven't really tasted elsewhere- what sets it aside in the most obvious sense is the thickness of it. In this sense it sticks out for better or worse among other curries around town but honestly, I love it. The spice levels all are distinguishable even with the texture. The owner, Hide, is such a sweet caring man and you can probably find him working when you go and will go out of his way to make sure you are happy because he cares deeply about his restaurant :) also he gives free rice if you finish it all and I appreciate that! My recommendation is the chicken cutlet curry with any spice level tbh. Even though it's close to my home I would go out of my way to come here if it were further. I mean I come here like every week along with my best friend since it's also really affordable and we're always broke lol. Much appreciation to Hide and his amazing curry!",

We will both stand by the owner \"Hide\" (pronounced he-day) in saying that this tastes just like the curry you would get at a cafe in Japan, and the pork and chicken cutlets were fried excellently. We also got an order of the red bean ice cream. It was awesome to get that flavor that I haven't had since coming back to the states.

If you know Japanese curry and you like it, then you have to give this place a try. They have three levels of spice... Mild, medium and hot. If you are not familiar with their level of spice, you can ask them for a sample to see what level would be good for you.  I got the hot and in the beginning it was just fine but after a couple of spoonfuls,the heat kicked in and sweat started to bead on my lip and I knew I should of got the medium instead. Haha but I enjoyed every last scoop of the curry.  The chicken katsu was a little on the thin side but it was breaded nice and golden brown with  nice white pieces of chicken.   If you need more rice, you can ask for more (no charge).   Still hungry?  You can try one of their desserts. They have a coffee twist and orange dream along with green tea or red bean ice cream ($1.39).   All in all this place rocks and the curry is authentic. The owner Hide is from Tokyo and brings down the Tokyo style to Las Vegas. Thank you Hide San!",

Their stamp card is great and makes me come back so I can receive a free meal! Whenever I go, there's not many people so I get the whole restaurant alone majority of the time. The food is delicious though, I always get the tonkatsu curry. Great service as well",

The curry and the pork is delicious, careful as you get it because it is really hot (temperature wise) I ended up added more chili powder onto the curry since I like my meals spicy! The tonkatsu was fried with a good amount of crisp and it there was a good amount of pork.   The service here was fast and the employees are very kind. If you're a budget eater, the meal is fairly priced for the amount you get! I'll definitely come back here!",

The curry was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. They also give you a huge serving of the curry so be prepared to eat! I could've just eaten the curry with rice which, by the way, is an option. They will also give you extra rice at no charge so you can soak up all that amazing curry.   The pork nuggets are covered in a sweet and savory Japanese BBQ sauce and are nice and juicy. It's a must order. Seriously. The Japanese salad was a simple salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and corn but the sesame dressing on it was amazing. Wish they sold bottles of it because I would eat a salad everyday...maybe.    The folks behind the counter were super friendly and attentive. Made dining here really pleasant. They also have stamp cards so after 8 stamps you get the 9th free. Will be back soon!",

    "text": "Oh! Curry is a pleasant surprise: Japanese Curry dishes that are tasty and affordable.   We were visiting Las Vegas + drove around looking for somewhere affordable to eat, off the Vegas Strip. We ended up at Oh! Curry located in a small strip mall. Most, if not all, entrees were $6.99 My daughters and I each had chicken curry (with grilled chicken) and my husband had the vegetable curry. Each plate was simple: steamed white rice, a generous serving of thick, savory curry sauce + cut up chicken (or sauteed vegetables). The portions were good: we don't have large appetites so each plate was enough, however it might not be enough for larger appetites.   The restaurant had coupons for free items so we chose the free kid's meal, which was rice, 2 chicken nuggets, a serving of curry sauce and French fries.   There was only one guy manning the register. He brought the food out to us and later took back the dirty dishes. The food was brought out as it became ready, so 2 of us got our meals, then the next 2 and a little later, the rest of the meals came out. We didn't mind this, but I know some people like all the meals brought out at the same time.   The meals were served on regular plates, with silverware. Paper napkins were available at the counter. We got fountain sodas, so nothing fancy. The decor is very simple + plain.    There are information leaflets on the history of curry in Japan. It's a nice read while you're waiting for your food and it was pretty informative. It's clear that the owners know what they're doing and they're proud of what they do.   The restroom was clean and tidy. The ladies room was a single stall, large enough to be accessible for those with disabilities.   So in conclusion, Oh! Curry offers delicious food at a reasonable price. Service is friendly, decor is plain. Great choice if you're hungry.",

The wait for the food did not take long at all. The portions are perfect: just enough that you clean your plate but leave full. On top of that, the service was wonderful. The owner made sure to check on us and let us know that if we needed more rice for our curry we could have it. I'll definitely be back.",

My favorite meal is the chicken cutlet, when you bite in to it the outside is crispy and the inside is really tender and juice. I usually get it hot but regular is also very tasty. My favorite side orders are the croquette and the salad they are so yummy a definite must try!!! Also the calpico Japanese drink is different but you will definitely love it. Affordable and delicious place to eat with family and friends :)",

I've lived over here for about 12 years-- it's not the best side but when you're not looking to travel, this is the best thing.  Chicken katsu, the grilled chicken with the curry, the rice and pork-- I'm hungry now, haha. Definitely a place to visit.",

Finally, a local mom and pop spot bringing some Japanese flavor to the Sunrise Mountain community.  Oh! Curry has a simple menu. You get your curry normal, mild, or hot. Then you choose what you want with your curry (grilled or katsu choices). Definitely hits the spot on a cold winter day. I wouldn't say that it's the best Japanese curry in the city (Curry Zen remains my fav), but it's definitely some good radius eating if you're in the area.  It's good simple Japanese comfort food. I ain't mad at that. It's good enough to keep me coming back.",

    "text": "I wonder if this place is named after Sadaharu Oh, because this place knocked it out of the ball park for their Japanese style curry.   Who would have thought that a East side Las Vegas strip center would have a hidden Japanese owned treasure.  If you didn't already know, I love my Japanese style curry, and even was awarded a ROTD for another curry house review in Las Vegas, but for some reason...I kind of like this place a little better.  Even though the past week, I made a pot of Japanese style curry at home, and hammered it, I still had a craving for it this weekend.  So I followed my bookmark, then ventured out this part of town.   Okay, I know what a few of you are thinking, East Las Vegas, and who the heck would come out here?   This is what I believe, some of the best places are located in the hood, for example, Honey Kettle fried chicken in Compton, and some of best tacos in the valley are just up the street from Oh! Curry.   Walking into Oh! Curry is unlike most of the area, because I was very impressed on how clean this restaurant was, and how friendly the staff made you feel.  The prices was very inexpensive compared to the other curry house in the valley, and their serving size was much larger than the competitors.   My order of the Tonkatsu curry was very good, and Oh! curry had a bolder, but sweeter flavor, and had a smoother milky consistency than Zen.  At $6.99, it was more than enough to make the me happy, and if I wanted more rice it would have been no extra charge for it.   Too bad, I didn't take picture of this dish, because it didn't stand a chance, and there wasn't a grain of rice on the plate.  Good stuff.  I thought of about the Orange dream while first ordering my meal, and why not...I was in bliss with the last dish.  So what the heck, how much calories can jello dessert really have!   Some how, the young lady got me thinking about their other flavor, Coffee!   As soon as the spoon hit this dessert, I was smiling because I haven't had Kanten in ages.  It was good!  Thinking about Oh! Curry, I'm stunned that this place is located so far from most Japanese folks in the Las Vegas valley, but on the other hand, Oh! Curry venturing out of their comfort zone will make anyone a fan of Japan's comfort dishes,  Oh! well, like what the famous saying in the movie, Field of Dream...Build it and they will come!   I have a feeling they will.",

In any Japanese restaurant you may find yourself in, there's a high probability they have some type of curry on their menu. However, Japanese Curry House in the east side of town was non existent until Oh! Curry opened its doors.   I finally had the chance to dine in twice after visiting my relatives in this side of town. The place is spacious, clean and airy. There are lots of options on the menu which I was impressed about such as curry udon, beef curry dog and curry soup with naan bread or rice to name a few.   On my first visit, I ordered their mild Chicken Cutlet with  Kurobuta Sausages for an additional $3.79 and that gave me four pieces of delicious sausages with a generous amount of curry sauce and rice. Their curry heat level is available in mild, medium or hot. I have to say that the curry sauce is delicious and flavorful! It is comparable to other curry sauces in town. The only thing I wish they may consider in the future, is to have their pickled radish as a free condiment like some other places do.   I love this family run Japanese Curry House. You will have the opportunity to meet the owner Hide, who is super friendly and brought Oh! Curry directly from Tokyo! It's a must try to taste their excellent, smooth and flavorful curry sauce. It may just become your new favorite!",

Of course, you'll see the katsu curry and the hamburger curry (oh the classics). I ordered the combo (chicken and beef katsu).  On spicy level: - I picked the hottest level. It wasn't too spicy. I licked the plate clean and only had to drink one small cup of water, haha - I tried mild and it wasn't spicy to me. It definitely needed a kick so I recommend medium or hot.

I believe I only paid under $15 for my boyfriend and I and we were really full and satisfied. I ordered the chicken and my bf had the pork and the chicken was better by a long shot. The pork was not tender at all and quite hard to eat. Also, you can add another serving of their chicken for only a little more!!   We came in about 30 mins before closing time. Employees were not very kind, but maybe it's because they were closing soon? They didn't let us dine there which made me wonder why they even gave us the option \"for here or to go?\" Also, I wish they added a little more radish, the plate literally comes with a dime sized piece of radish, maybe even smaller! But overall, it's really good here and I wish this place was closer to me because I'd definitely come here more!",

    "text": "Found this place around my work place for lunch. Given that I have never been around this area (Nellis and Stewart) or even in North Las Vegas, I did not know any good places to eat. I was having a craving for some curry at that time and super hungry. After looking on Yelp, I decided to go. So I came in around 12:30pm and it was pretty empty inside. Small little shop, with four tables. It was just me and a group of high schoolers eating at that time. I ordered the Pork Cutlet and added some vegetables. The cashier asked me the spicy level for my curry and I told her mild. As I'm paying, she asked if I had a stamp card and I told her no. When she gave me one, she was surprised because it seemed I've been here before knowing what to order already. I laughed and kindly told her I yelped before coming.   So I sat down to wait. They have benches on one side and a standard chair on the other side of the table. It was a bit uncomfortably at first to sit on, but I got used it to. They prepared and brought out the plate pretty quick. It was a big portion and filled me up really well!   The pork cutlet was crispy and tender. Seasoned well. The curry was not at all overly spicy. Just the way I liked it. Also they had a small table of condiments and forks and spoons near the cashier, so if I wanted a bit more spicy, I could add some hot sauce. I really enjoyed the flavors and the veggies were sliced cucumbers, yellow squash, and mushrooms. It also included a tiny portion of pickled ginger. The rice was cooked very well. Not too dry or mushy. Just how I would cook it at home. Oh Curry, is definitely one of my new favorite Japanese curry spot to go from now on. If there's ever a day I forget to bring my lunch to work, I'll stop by to get some curry here. The cashier/servicer was really nice. She kept checking up on me to ask if everything was okay. I really appreciated that!",

They are genuine mom and pop shop with original curry recipe. They have an outstanding return customer program, additionally did I say all their recipes and food is made from scratch? It is hands down one of my favorite spots to eat in town. I always come back and always change my order as for everything in the menu is worth the price and wait to add a sensation of flavor to your taste buds.",

After a few minutes he told us it would be about 20 minutes before we get our food cuz he was sending out last minute online orders. We had the time so we waited and eventually got our food (chicken cutlets- regular and tonkatsu-mild). The portion was on the big side, half the plate was rice and lots of curry. The flavor was great, the manager (at least I think he was) was very polite and at one point asked us if we've had Japanese curry before and showed us how to eat it. Over all I would definitely go back and bring/drag my mom with me.",

You can add cheese to it if you'd Like, but I like it regular and maybe with a side of tofu. Also, If you haven't tried the croquette before, give it a shot, it is interestingly delicious. Great meat substitute. The Calpico drink is very refreshing and compliment the meal very well. The gentleman there is always so nice and makes ordering easy, you can phone your order ahead and have it ready for pick up so you can enjoy at home. He will explain to you about the curry getting a bit thick and how to prepare it of you will have a long drive home. Overall worth a check out if you are on the East side of Las Vegas.",

I got the Tonkatsu curry and Chicken katsu curry both with cheese, fries, and a drink for under $20. The curry is more like a gravy and perfectly executed the Japanese curry style. Definitely a must visit and a refreshing burst of dining diversity in east Las Vegas",

When our food arrived, the esthetic of the plate left something to be desired, but omg!!! The food was really amazing! My boyfriend had the chicken cutlet and I had the tonkatsu. It was so delicious; we both loved it.  I've lived right around the corner since before they opened and was always curry curious. It took almost two years and a freebie to get me to go. I was always surprised to see it still open. Nowi know how they have managed to survive in this somewhat cursed location... Simple delicious food.   The only reason I only gave four stars was due to the appearance of the plate. Other than that, it was excellent. We have gone back and taken or friends. It's so much better than any of the surrounding fast food places.   Hurry Hurry to OH CURRY!!!",

All in all if you live on the east side of Vegas and  want affordable curry that taste like it should cost a lot, stop by plus they have some pretty great deals!! I guess you can say that I'm a regular customer and a fan of all their tasty food!",

Da concept of just curry with da choice of different types of meat is soooo smart. With that being said, the Japanese curry is tasty and you can be in charge of how spicy you want it. I got the tonkatsu/chicken cutlet combo medium heat. Half way through this delicious meal, I spiced it up a bit by adding da spicy powder. Yummy, a whole new taste half way through da same meal. The service here is off da charts. Right away he asked us if this was our first time. He went through da whole menu and took his time explaining everything. 2 thumbs up on service and cleanliness of da restaurant. This place is a must try. Only suggestion is a side of mac salad to top off da great taste experience. Come to da east side and try this great curry house. Aloha",

    "text": "\"Oh! Curry\" stood out to me compared to other restaurants in Vegas, not only is it the only of its kind in this area but I've never even heard of Japanese curry until the first day that my boyfriend and I walked in to give it a try. I've tried Thai and Indian curry before, but to be honest I didn't like it so much so of course I was skeptical at first.      Believe me when I tell you, I wish I have heard of Japanese curry before because it's absolutely delicious, flavorful, and satisfying; in my eyes it's the perfect comfort food. Not only is the food amazing, so is the service, cleanliness, and the overall quality of the restaurant. I always feel welcomed when I walk in and leave with a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face. The food is authentic Japanese food and I feel like im in a small part of Japan when I eat there, and I can't go a week without eating there because its so good!      I've also found that on their facebook page they're ALWAYS doing facebook promotions so you can get a discount off of your meal, this is amazing considering how inexpensive it is to dine here in the first place. Oh, and you also get all you can eat rice if you're dining in, all you have to do is ask! I definitely recommend for anyone to go here if you haven't already, I PROMISE you wont disappointed.",

The restaurant is spotless and the nice girl behind the counter was busy cleaning the whole time i was there.  The food was well packaged, with the curry separate so the food would not get soggy, and it was taped closed so it could not leak! Awesome! The food was fantastic!  Salad was delicious and fresh, with a creamy sesame seed dressing. The veggies were very flavorful, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  The curry was divine!  Different from Indian curry.  Seems more hearty.  All of the cooked food was nice and hot (in temperature.) And the spicy curry is definitely hot but still packed with incredible flavor.  You can tell how good it will be by the aroma as soon as you enter!  I wish there were more vegetarian options, such as eggplant or tofu, or ??? And personally, I would love it if they offered brown rice as an option.  I can't wait to try the coffee and orange dream jellos next time.  This is absolutely my favorite place now!!!! It is also the healthiest and freshest food I have found in this area, by far! I wish I had tried it sooner!",

Passive aggressive service. Haha   The menu up until recently has been out of date with the beef curry still hanging on the back wall though it has been discontinued. And for the soda machine that only has one to two options available at all times. The cup size has gotten smaller but the price has still stayed the same.

You go in the heavenly aroma of curry can be found. Just from the smell of the restaurant alone I knew this would be good. I ordered a chicken cutlet curry, a drink and an orange jello for dessert. Very affordable and very nice portion size. I left full for sure. The chicken was crispy and not greasy at all, rice was perfect and the curry was amazing. I ordered the regular/medium curry and plan to give the hot a shot next time and there will be a next time. Many next times. The orange jello was jello with some whipped cream on top. Nothing fancy but a nice way to end the meal.   They give you a stamp card so every 8 dishes you buy you get 1 free and unlike some places you get free refills. If you se in the neighborhood definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it.",

Hide, the man himself, is super friendly! Strikes up conversation with his customers whenever he can and always has a smile on his face  On arrival he walked us through his menu since we were first timers in his humble restaurant. The food rolled out very quickly, and boy was it amazing! The serving is huge, rice is plentiful and the pricing is perfect! I come from a Vietnamese family so the curry I've had is more soup-like. Hide's curry is nicely thick and goes perfectly with the rice and meat cutlets. My fiance added a side of Gyoza to her curry and it was to die for  It didn't seem so...heavy (?) compared to the Gyoza I've had at many dim sum restaurants. The fries and curry dipping sauce make for a great combo! The fries soak up the curry so well and it's great  After our meal we decided to enjoy desert, we ordered an orange dream and it was delicious, pretty much a creamsicle. Hide was very generous and gave us a coffee twist with the orange dream. Everything just made for an amazing dine in experience.  Hide's made a customer for life and he'll be seeing the two of us very often!",

First timers at the restaurant get a discount as well - be sure to check out the flyer for the different coupons.  Fun fact: The owner is going to start offering Curry Dogs on his menu!  Yummmm",

If you have ever had Coco Itchibanya Curry House in Hawaii this is the closest you will find in Vegas! The location is a bit far from me but well worth the drive don't let the location scare you. The food is well worth it. I went with my son and My Dad which i will say we're leery about the place. After we all ordered 2 chicken katsu curries one regular and mild with a side of the potato croquettes and 1 spicy pork cutlet. We were all amazed how delicious the curry was. There pickled radish was the best in town especially with my rice and curry. The katsu was the bomb cooked just right not to tough like a lot of these places serving katsu here in  Vegas. It is a definite must try a hidden gem for us locals! To top it off the gentleman in the restaurant who may be the owner was kind, friendly and knowledgeable we talked a bit about all the curry spots her and different Japanese restaurants in town. I can tell he enjoys good authentic food as much as i do!",

Oh Curry is a great stop for quick lunch, especially during rushed hours when time is not on your side. Finally, mild is mild and Hot is Medium so do not expect a heat suppose.

I was super excited when it first opened!  I ordered katsu curry to go and the owner is really nice!  He explained how to reheat the curry so I have the same consistency at home (fyi, you add a little bit of water and heat it up in the microwave.)    You can get your curry in either, mild, medium, or hot.  My second time trying it, I bought one of each and found hot to be the most flavorful, without being nose dripping spicy.  I saw some chili powder near the counter, so you could add some more heat while dining in.  They now have pickled radish!  It adds a nice texture and taste to the curry.    The curry is comparable to the ones in Chinatown, considering where it's located.  Out of the four curry spots I've had in Vegas, this place ranks second in my book.  Which is pretty good!

    "text": "First, I have to mention that the people who work this store are extremely nice and fun to talk to! Out of all the Asian peoples, the Japanese are known to have the greatest customer service--it's True. :)   Oh! Curry is a restaurant that is new and pretty clean, with a large bench of tables that you could hella throw birthday parties in and a pretty straightforward menu! We visited this location because my friend adores Japanese curry and I just love curry in general; and I was not disappointed.   Their curry was extremely cheap and pretty good! (I do wish the regular had more spice though lol) The price is legit; they give you a lot of rice, a lot of curry, and a good amount of meat!! They also have some sides: fried chicken, fries, and tonkatsu. These you can buy separately and dip in curry--YUM!   Also, that jelly dessert is just delicious. I don't even like orange flavored things, but it was great!! And the owner told us that he was adding coffee jelly to the menu and let us taste it--IT WAS BOMB. The man is gonna be known for that coffee jelly, guys. They should really add more jelly flavors to their menu because it's just too good to pass up!   We didn't order a drink, but soda is 1.29 and bottled water is --under a dollar--. Even at gas stations, that can be rare lol.   So, I'm in love with their curry, and I will be trying their hottest curry next time",

    "text": "Finally an Asian spot on the east side! It's hard to compete with china town but I was pleasantly surprised.   After my first visit today is definitely go back. The price is right, the food quality was good, and the place was clean with a nice staff.  You basically pick a meat to go with your curry sauce and rice.  I'm accustomed to eating Japanese curry at home. It's simple and cheap to make. I'd definitely say I know a thing or two about food curry.  They have beef, grilled or fried chicken, veggie, or plain.   Comes with the meat and comes with white rice and the sauce. You can order sides also.  I believe they all come with the same sauce which has a bit of a spice to it.  First of all the counter girl was awesome. She asked if I was a first timer and also checked with the kitchen for wait times on the orders. I thought that was really cool of her.  Anyways my order was Tonkatsu pork to go.  The girl have me instructions on reheating which I thought was awesome.  The amount of sauce they gave me seemed excessive but when I ate it all with the rice is say it was a food amount. It was served with some pickled ginger on top which was nice.  The sauce itself was good. It had a lot of heat. The heat might even have been a bit much IMO. I would have liked it to have more depth of flavor and less heat but it was still good.  The rice they used was really good. I'd say it is about 1.5-2 cups of white rice.   The Tonkatsu was perfectly fried and juicy. I'd say it was lacking in the flavor department. It could have used some salt. Again the lightly breaded pork was fried perfectly. Also this isn't pounded like Hawaiian Katsu chicken.  Overall I'd definitely go back.",

It feels like it'll eventually lose its business due to having barely any traffic coming through here. Buts its a really good place! Portions are good for the price you pay. Vegetable curry is the cheapest, and they give you barely any vegetables, so order a side. The curry sauce is great at hot level, and the meat is cooked very well. Soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, unless doused in curry. Give this place a try, it deserves more business",

I ordered fried chicken with fries and extra cheese (MILD) curry. The chicken was juicy and the curry was hot in temp. What I liked about this curry in particular is that it didn't have carrot chunks that other curry I've tried had. Needless to say the food was delicious and the portions were excellent for the price.

I had never eaten curry before and did not know what to expect.  The place was clean, spacious and the person that took my order was friendly.  The large picture of dishes on the wall were about as unappetizing as I had ever seen.  The only colors were brown sauce with white rice with a few \"lumps\" under the sauce.  No Color whatsoever, but I thought it might  be an advertising mistake that the owner just had to deal with.  I ordered Curry with pork and what came out was 1/2 a plate of white rice on one side,  with the ugliest brown sauce  covering the other half and a fried pork patty (sliced into about 8 slices)  laying on top.  My dish had no vegetables to give it color and It was one of the most unappetizing dishes that has ever been served to me.  If you look at the pictures posted, you will see the plates with brown sauce and white rice that  I'm talking about.   If this was a typical dish of Japanese Curry, it is not for me.   I wish this place well and would suggest you try it for yourself as my tastes and preferences may not be the same as others.  It is hidden and only viewable from Stewart directly across the street from CiCi's Pizza.  (You  have to be going east on Stewart and turn into a small strip mall, just before you come to Nellis, to access Oh Curry)",
