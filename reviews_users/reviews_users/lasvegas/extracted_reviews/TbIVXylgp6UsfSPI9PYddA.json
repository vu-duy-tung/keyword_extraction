I had several cups to wake me up after a early flight. Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, burger topped with eggs were all delicious. Bloody Mary's looked awesome, we were sitting near the bar. One negative, onion rings were soggy and sub par to everything else we had. Found out after asking the server, this was their opening first weekend . As we leaving, this little place got packed. Will stop here everytime we are in Vegas. Don't think the chain has made it  to TX  yet.",

    "text": "The Broken Yolk is a nice place for breakfast/lunch. The menu features several unique benedict creations, omelettes, mexican style dishes and some tempting sweet pancake/waffle selections, so the variety is interesting. I had a create your own omelette with chili and green onions and cheese (they actually forgot the cheese but no biggie, it was still good), hash browns and a biscuit. The portions are large, the food came out hot, the service was timely, attentive, and friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The restaurant itself was full and pretty loud, but that's probably pretty normal for a busy breakfast place. For locals, I would put it on par with an Eggworks or Egg and I, but not quite as good as The Omelette House or the Original Pancake House. Just my own personal preference but you may have a different opinion. Definitely worth a visit though.",

After 20 minutes of waiting, I finally had to flag our waitress down and it seemed as if we were bothering her. So sorry I inconvenienced you to actually do your job. After that lovely encounter, our food came fairly quick. Food was decent but guess what!?! WAITRESS...somewhere, anywhere!? Nope. Empty cups, needed a box, needed the check to get out of there. Another 20 minutes, whoop!! I got up to ask the front area lady and she didn't even look up and said where's your waitress. I pointed and she said, you need to deal with her. WOW!! What is the hiring process you guys have. Hey, do you have no personality, hate people and want to piss off customers!? YOU'RE HIRED!!! Good luck with your customer service team. Have a bunch of winners. May want to wipe the place clean and start over. It's sad as the food was good.

I have been to many of the other locations and never had this problem. First the order took forty three minutes to get with three requests on the status. I'm sorry but forty three minutes for breakfast?  Finally someone said they had a health inspector in and it was slowing things down. One, most quality locations would have said something to the newly seated customer that it may take a little longer for your food due to the inspectors visit, not done. Two, had to flag down someone twice to get a refill on my coffee. And to top it off in a most grandiosely fashion, my eggs Benedict came out with two hard boiled eggs on top and everything cold. They did do the correct thing even though I said not to, bright out two perfect eggs. But why, the meal was by then cold. Learning mode can only get you by for so long. What a shame as I have enjoyed this companies service at other locations outside of Vegas.",

Our waitress was very good, she didn't even need to write down our order! Ok now let's fast forward to 5/17/19 when my son decides to treat my daughter and I to breakfast. Our server was Matthew and the only words he said to us the whole time we were there was to take our order. He kept looking at us in weird way that made me feel upset and we couldn't even enjoy our meal. I would still like to know what the problem was?  Was it my sons Lakers cap? Race? What???????? The busser was very nice so I made sure to give him the tip and I hope that he didn't have to share it with Matthew. Our waiter just put our bill on the table and didn't say one word so I didn't know that you don't pay at the front anymore & I went to pay and the hostess told me that the waiter takes the payment now. I told her my experience with him and she was nice enough to take my payment for me. She also gave me the yelp card to share my comments and said that she'd let the manager know our experience. We've never experienced this type of service anywhere ever! I'm hoping that the manager does address this so that it doesn't happen to anyone else! I knew we should've stuck with Metro Diner or Eggworks. Also, this is my first time on yelp.",

There's seating outside (which I hope they will expand more because it wasn't a lot of room outside). There's a LOT of food for the price. Speaking of price, it's really reasonable, about $$. I had the crunchy french toast and it was TO DIE FOR!!! My honey had the waffle sandwich and he really enjoyed it.   We also arrived at a very busy time on Saturday (around 12pm) and we only had to wait about 10mins to get seated.  The only thing that could be improved in is getting bigger high top tables.  The high top tables they have now are WAY too small, especially when they have the condiments rack sitting on the table.  That alone takes up half the table space, and there is no room left for any plates, especially with the amount of plates it takes to hold all of the food that they give you.  Its DEFINITELY not enough room for 2 people to sit at.",

    "text": "First time here and it was very good! I ordered the chicken and waffles benedict with a side of fruit. The portion size isn't the biggest but it was perfect for me. I came here after the gym and drank a lot of my water prior to actually eating my meal, so take that into consideration. The flavor was very good in all parts of the meal. It's basically a chicken tender on a waffle and then the poached egg and hollandaise sauce. The chicken wasn't overly breaded and seasoned well, the the waffle was fluffy and had a decent crust on the outside, the hollandaise sauce was a great consistency and creamy! Both the poached eggs still had a great runny yolk! The only thing that I didn't enjoy was that the hollandaise sauce made the waffle very very soggy half way through my meal. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE when there is a lot of sauce, especially in the traditional eggs benedict. With english muffins, the sauce gets soaked up enough to where it softens the bread, but doesn't loose its shape. Because the waffle here is so fluffy it just turned out to be soggy. I'd probably suggest serving a light ladle of the sauce for the aesthetic look that benedicts have and probably serve the remainder in a separate sauce ramikin or something. Other then that, I would highly recommend and will be coming back!!",

It was Memorial Day, we were a party of 10 and the place was packed. The second we got there we were greeted at the host stand to put our party on the list. While waiting outside, there is complimentary water, coffee and muffin which I thought was pretty awesome.   Once seated we were greeted by the waitress for our drinks, then followed with taking our orders then followed with the delivery of the order. Everything flowed really nicely and timely. The waitress was quick, the food runners were fast and as I scanned the place the bussers were so quick to turn the table for the next party. Another great thing to see was the Manager was very hands on. He helped greet, seat, clean, opened doors etc while looking calm and collected.   Customer Service was great and even greater to see that Customer Service was not sacrificed for quick service. It was very well balanced.   Would definitely come back!!",

He was very friendly and we struck up a conversation about the LA Chargers.  Chelsea was our server.  Chelsea was prompt and efficient.  My wife ordered the ham and cheese omelette and I ordered the Golden State Benedict.  The Benedict was delicious as it had 2 strips of bacon and sriracha sauce on top of the hollandaise sauce.

    "text": "After visiting San Diego and enjoying breakfast at the Pacific Beach location I was excited when I heard they opened one at Town Square!   First visit was 6/10 although we had a large party of 12 and half of them being kids, I understand it can be overwhelming. Like majority of the people in this town I have been in the service industry for 14 years and understand people have off days. So we decided to give it another try with four of us eating.  So on the second take the service was worse. The server never asked if I wanted anything to drink so I had to flag her down. No big deal! But then I had to tell her that I wanted to order food. When it finally arrived I asked for mushrooms in my omelette which there were none. So I told the runner not to worry about it, but he insisted on remaking it which took another 15 minutes. The second time it came the mushrooms weren't even cooked.   The best part of all was the Manager was busier trying to chat up the hostess rather than expedite or run the (no exaggeration) 12 plates sitting in the window. Good Luck Broken Yolk, Im sure you'll be a Chili's in about 6 months.",

The reviews were correct, this restaurant was busy and full but we didn't feel neglected at all. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was exceptional. Their online waiting process was refreshing and they even provided complimentary beverages while we waited. We highly recommend this new spot and may make this a regular venue we visit.   I should also mention, this was on Easter Sunday so you can imagine what I mean when I say BUSY. The staff was still all smiles and efficient. Our server was amazing. I think his name was Steven (I will edit when I know for sure).   BIG KUDOS!!!",

Our server Mathew sucked. I felt discriminated.The manager Jaclyn was rude Asf. Our food didn't look properly cooked and when we told the manger she seemed so bothered. She took the food to the back and brought back the SAME dish. That's a violation, she just refried the onions, after we had already taken a bite. She contaminated everything. Mathew didn't give us the correct change back and when we told them, the manger laughed and said \"Oh she needs her correct change\".",

    "text": "Located in an obscure corner in the Fry's parking lot. After I sat inside for lunch and ordered the half sandwich with soup and salad, I tried to remember the name of the restaurant I was in. This is the grand opening and I just walked in off the street with a business associate.  I looked around me, here, there, everywhere for a sign of the business. From my vantage was no clue as to the name of the place until I searched restaurants near me on Yelp and found the name.  I think that the menu items are a dollar or two pricier than they should be, which is why I am giving this a 4 star review. The food was presented on clean new white plates and bowls, which looks appetizing. For a grand opening day, I would have thought that they would do more to brand themselves for referrals and repeat business.  There were only a few balloons outside, very low key .  They don't offer any freebies on their big day.  Nothing to take away from the experience to make them standout from the nearby competitors. The only thing they did do is interrupt our eating every few minutes to ask how it was, which was a little annoying while I was writing this review and discussing business with my associate. After my meal, which was delicious, I was still hungry.  For a local who is used to paying $7 for all you can eat buffets,$30 with a tip seemed pricey.  But, again, the food is good and I will eat here again. They have a real bar, inside, which is cool and outdoor seating with a view of the free way entrance.",

    "text": "Some friends of mine came to town and were staying not too far from here, so we decided to try this place for breakfast.  One of my bosses is from San Diego and he said this place was really good.  I really didn't expect it to be as busy as it was, because they haven't been open long, and they're in a fairly new strip center.  However, for our party of three, we waited about 15 minutes at 9am on a Sunday Morning.  I must say that they staff was excellent, friendly, and helpful.  I ordered the Acai Bowl (pictured).  It was good, but it was a LOT of citric acid.  I should've gotten some bacon or hash browns or something different to go with it, to balance out the citric acid, but I did not.  But don't get me wrong, it was good & fresh.  One of my friends had one of the Benedict dishes.  She enjoyed it very much.  And her boyfriend had the Tuna Melt, which if I ate those, it looked really good.  I couldn't tell if he ordered onion rings or fries that were circular.  They looked like rings, but they also looked very small for onion rings.  I should've asked him.  The place was packed, yet it was immaculate. I definitely look forward to eating there again.  It was very good.",

    "text": "Been here twice now. Everything I've gotten is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The first time, I ordered an omelette with bacon and ham and onions. The food came out fast and was delicious. My friend also ordered an omelette and while she did not say whether she enjoyed it or not, the plate was clear so I'm guessing she did. The second time, I went more traditional with the bacon and eggs plate. Also delicious. Bacon was  cooked and the eggs were fluffy. I also ordered a biscuit and you could definitely tell it was home made. Flakey, buttery, and huge. The only downside was that the jam was not home made. We also ordered a mimosa flight to share and had 4 different flavors and was reasonably priced. All in all, would recommend.",

    "text": "This day we decided to skip a brunch buffet instead headed to a regular serving brunch. Since it is newly open at this area most of the uber drive are not familiar with the place but if you live in Vegas or have a rented car, you can drive yourself and enjoy a massive parking space which they shared to the other establishment.  When we got in around passed noon-ish the place was not packed and got our table instantly. We sat down, ordered some drinks, and browse the menu. First, let me just say that they have a wide variety of food and drink options, and I saw a full bar so they might even have a variety of drinks (ask your server to be sure). Once we decided we got:  Mimosa - Well, I did not have this but it was in the skinny tall glass.  Soy Latte - I just started drinking soy milk and added it to my drinks, I am still a newbie, at that time the latte does not taste soy milk at all, there's this distinct taste of soy that you will not get from regular cow milk, well, I might be wrong. Well, I still had it and moved on.   Shorstack Blueberry Pancake with a side of Two eggs and Two Patties - These pancakes were huge, we shared and still took me a good hour to finish my part. The taste was okay, not too buttery, a little bit toasted at the bottom but that was okay I don't mind a little crunch. Eggs were cooked perfectly just add seasoning, and the patties were good too not salty at all.  Stuffed French Toast Combo with Two Eggs and Two Turkey Patties - French toast was delicious, it was not too sweet, the caramel complements everything in it.   Size - pancake and french toast were huge enough that you can share it.  Service - everyone was nice and attentive, but they look like they were on the edge or something.  It was a good brunch, I enjoyed the French toast the most. I would go back again and try something else.  p.s When I went to the bathroom one of the male crew members restock the tissue or something, next time I suggest announce or ask if someone is there, they will probably reply back since the bathroom is pretty small.",

    "text": "Not everything was a win, but it was still pretty good :) We were impressed by the decor and modern feel of the restaurant. Our order started with the mimosa flight, which was amazing with orange juice, grapefruit juice, pomegranate juice, & a sunrise juice. We had the S.B.A. Omelet, the John Wayne omelet, and the stuffed French toast. The SBA was the kind of thing you can pretty much make at home, but a good option when you want something between healthy and 'not so good for you' lol. My hubs says the John Wayne had too much onion and we both thought that there wasn't enough filling in the stuffed French toast. The service wasn't exactly the best, but I knew she was trying with the many tables she had. Overall, it's a good spot to go for simple breakfast and Mimosas. We would still return to try it out again.",

We came on a weekday at 1:30 so it wasn't too busy. We got the first burrito, it was huge and so much flavor!!! Def worth the calories. And we also got the crunchy French toast which was deeeeelicious! Soooo tasty. Only downfall was the raspberry jam on top l, I'm not a fan of raspberries but I looked past it because I didn't read the menu and it was so delicious that I didn't care much. You have to try it!!! The coffee though, below average. I would skip on the coffee. Still over all 5 starts for service and food. I'd come back again very soon!",

    "text": "Occasionally I will look up \"Hot & New\" restaurants and see if something piques my interest. I did just that and came across the BYC. I'm all for brunch food and gave it a try. I was glad to see that there's finally another brunch place at Town Square so my friends could finally meet me \"halfway\" between Henderson & Summerlin lol.  Helpful Tip: I'd recommend \"joining the live waitlist\" before heading there (through Yelp) which basically saves you a spot, but you must check in once you're there to confirm it. I did this and only waited 5 minutes at around 10am while there were other parties already waiting in line. It kinda works similar to how Supercuts/Great Clips does their mobile check-in. Very convenient.  Interior: The inside is deceivingly large and has a lot of tables that can accompany many 4-6 person parties. The outdoor patio has plenty of seating with umbrellas as well. There's live sports on the TVs and Vegas sports team art pieces on the walls.   Service/Server: The girl who sat us was really nice and told us that they opened about 12 days prior. Our server was Rusty and he was very friendly and gave us some good recommendations. He told us that the Broken Yolk was a chain from San Diego. Most everything we asked about on the menu he said was \"bomb\" so we had a little trouble kinda picking something to eat. When we finally got our food our waters were only filled the first time and never refilled after that. Our server checked on us once when we got our food, and then kinda disappeared until we were finished. My water cup was empty mid-meal and finally got refilled when we were already done eating (if that matters to some people).  Food:  We ended up ordering the (1) Chicken Fried Steak, (2) the Golden State Benedict, and (3) the crunchy French toast. It took about 20-25 min to finally get our food, which didn't really bother us because there were tv's to watch and time just passed by.  Each of their dishes were good but nothing to write home about.  (1) The CFS was a fair size and the gravy was just like I'd imagine it too, (nothing sweet like at Babystacks) and hash browns were just right. (2) The benedict we ordered had an overcooked poached egg and the yolk did not ooze out as we expected when cutting into it. (3) The crunchy French toast was just toast with corn flakes (atleast it tasted like just corn) on top drizzled with raspberry sauce. I was hoping there would be something to make me say \"oh my gwodd\" but I just ate it to eat it.   Albeit I'm not a food snob, but the food was acceptable. It tasted exactly as you would expect it to and there isn't a \"wow\" factor to it.  (Side note: Some of my favorite breakfast places to eat are Truffles & Bacon, Kitchen Table, DW Bistro, and Peg's, for comparison)  TL;DR  The interior is nice, the staff is friendly and service is okay for being a busy restaurant, food is a solid and a good fix and it tastes as you'd expect it to, but it was nothing spectacular. It is worth giving it a try with your friends/spouse/by yourself since it's Hot & New. I'll definitely come back to try other things and hopefully change my initial impressions.",

Besides the beautiful presentation of the food, it is full of flavor and every ingredient is just right. This was the only picture I got of the food, we had demolished everything else we ordered lol.

Oh and shout out to Chelsea for providing us with the best customer service we have ever had in Vegas! She was super friendly and very informative on the whole menu!

The environment is very open and welcoming. We were greeted by the server and didn't wait long for our party of 8. They have a few selections for skillets, I had the hash skillet and my sister the ranchero. They were good just, too me there was too much potatoes. Other than that the skillets were good but nothing to go home writing about. The acai bowl is huge and very filling, enough to share. The tiki toast was delicious, enough to share as well. For it being open only for a few weeks the menu and service is quite good. Thanks Broken Yolk!",

There are plenty of tables, and arriving at 11am on a Tuesday it was only a few minutes to wait for a table for two.  The service was just a little bit slow as it seemed like our waitress was working quite a few tables, but what it lacked in speed it made up for in friendliness.  We started with the very appealing Mimosa and Bloody Mary Flights, both including 4 small varieties of each beverage. The Mimosas were delightful, and the Bloody Mary flight was good, but definitely included a lot of the alcoholic base. The morning cocktail menu was huge and definitely includes a little something for every alcoholic inclination.  The Tiki Toast was just as delicious as it looks in the photo, and surprisingly not too sweet. I was expecting an almost cake like texture but was pleased to find that it was a lot like a classic French Toast, just with a sweet bread instead of classic toast triangles.  The 'Momlette' as I called it was beautifully plated and tasted fresh, light, and fluffy. The hash browns were crispy and delicious.   Overall, The Broken Yolk Cafe lives up to the hype. I will definitely visit again!",

I ordered the huevos rancheros and thought it was ok. Fiance ordered chicken fried steak and eggs which he really enjoyed. I can see myself coming back to try this CA chain for other menu items. It's definitely going to do really well because it's so close to the airport and people seem to know the chain already.",

My family and I came here and the workers were so nice and the food was excellent. We opted to sit outside and it was such a nice day! They have inside seating too and there are umbrellas outside which was super nice. Even though we were seated outside we still got plenty of attention from our server and did not have to beg for refills or anything extra we needed. We all enjoyed our food and our server was a sweet lady. We bonded over our babies and it was seriously just a nice experience overall. HIGHLY recommend coming here.",

We were seated for about 7-10 minutes and haven't heard from our server. (Place was not busy)This is a new restaurant and our first time being here so off the back that was  it a good sign. When our server came around she automatically asked if we were ready. A pretty ehh welcoming since we overheard her give the whole introduction to the table behind us. Asked for a few suggestions, she didn't seem to know the menu to well.  As for our order, decided to do family style and try different things.   Tiki Toast -  yum a must try if you're craving something sweet.  Crunchy French toast - another must have if you're craving something sweet  Machaca-  meh, not to much flavor Hash Skillet -  yes! The best thing we ordered it was full of flavor and just all over yum.  Food was pretty good, service meh.  We got a free waffle coupon just 1 for a table of 4 so we will give this place another chance.",

It is a kid friendly place. The food was delicious and I liked that the menu had a wide variety of options. We had two of the eggs Benedict options and a Belgian waffle. I definitely recommend this place over the breakfast chains anyway. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant itself is clean and spacious. We didn't have to wait too long for our food either.

Keep in mind the portion size for the pancakes are big. The food was delicious! They do also have a bar and they have all different varieties of cocktails and drinks.

So on our last day before heading home, we decided to try this place out for breakfast. From the moment we walked into the restaurant we were greeted with a warm welcome. The place was very clean , and we were seated quickly. The hostess told us that our waiter will be coming shortly, his name is Rusty. Rusty came by, took our drink order and asked if we had been here before. We said first timers here. He had some recommendations for us and we were not disappointed. Rusty would check up on us to make sure everything was ok. If you are ever in Las Vegas and want to have great food and great service. You should stop by this place. If possible ask to be seated in Rusty's section he'll take good care of you. Here are some pictures of our food selections. Please don't judge us, we couldn't make up our minds. Hahaha",

We we're shown to our table and Crystal was our waitress. She is super bubbly and gave many amazing suggestions. I got the chicken and waffles Benedict with home fries and it was amazing! The waffles are super fluffy, soft, and flavorful. My boyfriend got The Gaslamp sandwich and Crystal made a great suggestion to add diced serrano peppers to the sandwich and it elevated it even more! I got the Ceasar Bloody Mary, it was a hard decision because their drink menu comes with so many options and specialty cocktails for the Vegas location. My boyfriend ended up getting the BYC Old Fashioned and the Dr. Pepper syrup gave it a great twist. We will definitely be coming back to this location whenever we are in town! Thank you Crystal and the staff here at The Broken Yolk for your amazing service and great hospitality.",

The food was really tasty and our waiter Matthew had us laughing constantly. He was very attentive as well as we asked for a few things and if certain ingredients were in some dishes, so he checked and acted like it was no problem at all. He was so friendly and we knew we wanted to write a review as my friend loved his humour as did I. I think it's a new place, not sure, but it was nice and friendly atmosphere and we both really enjoyed our food as well. Highly recommended",

While trying to figure out what to have our waitress Amanda helped explain the menu and what her favorites were. I had a breakfast burrito and made some substitutions which were easily accommodated. My husband had the stuffed french toast and said it's the best stuff he's ever had. Amanda helped us sign up for a reward card which will be beneficial as we will be back. Definitely recommend for the family or early morning breakfast date.",

They open at 6am so if you're an early bird this is your place. The service is great, our waitress was very kind and all smiles. She was fast an efficient. Very classy decor. I will definitely be back for some more delicious food and great service. Thanks Broken Yolk for being my new brunch spot....",

You say there is no reservation and yet you accept calls ahead of time to be added on the list!?! What do you call that?! It's RACISM that's what it is.   Good thing we had a witness who confirmed that the group they seated before us just arrived and didn't even call! They just got there, barely signed in and got called in right away didnt even wait 30 mins and they told us the waiting time is 30 mins.   Then they blame their technology- NO! Make all the excuses in the world, but that was just horrible.   When all you wanted was try a new place for brunch place and get screwed over.   You haven't been seated, food hasn't even been served and you're already screwed.   If you have time to chitchat your customers, gee perhaps use that time to fix your system in taking in customers.   Also get some sensitivity training while you're at it, if you want to be professional racists.",

I opted for the Benedict with bacon & avocado (can't remember its name) and my friend got the No-name omelette and we were both very pleased with our meals. Our waiter, Jon, was a smiling face who took great care of us. Our orders came out quickly and correctly, pleasantly surprising given how busy it was.   I look forward to coming back for more!",

    "text": "Opened early April of 2019, but a known entity near San Diego for forty years, The Broken Yolk Cafe promised to capture Las Vegas' attention by offering \"high quality, homemade Food in large portions,\" and a visit on Sunday showed the locally-owned space already very successful with a thirty-five minute wait despite windy weather at 11:00am.   An expanding concept with over thirty locations across six states, Sin City's first adjacent Total Wine at Town Square, it is after securing parking that guests approach a freshly built space capable of seating hundreds, though for a Restaurant so new and busy service is outstanding from the General Manager manning a digital waitlist to servers, bussers and even folks at the hostess stand.  Made (more) famous by an appearance on \"Man vs Food,\" a twelve-Egg Omelet weighing in at nearly 4,000 calories earning a free T-shirt and comped check for those who finish under an hour, it is from a five page menu that those desiring more variety are invited to make choices, a full-bar offered from open to close daily also provided to tempt those who desire more than just Mimosas and Bloody Marys.  Priced competitive to Cracked Egg or Babystacks, and approximately half the cost of other Las Vegas Boulevard Breakfasts, it was with bottomless Coffee and Cocktails ranging $8-10 each that things got underway, \"Suit & Thai\" proving a bit bitter but certainly not lacking for Booze while \"Chai Little One\" and \"Pucker Up Strawberry Lemonade\" each acted as light sippers that compliment The Broken Yolk Cafe's fare nicely.  Opting to dine across three-courses, though in reality a check-average of approximately $18 will leave most over-sated, first bites came from extra-large Biscuits made from scratch with Butter, a gentle yeastiness amidst good rise attesting to quality with or without added Honey while Onion Rings and Hash Browns each cook up crispy as sides to a generous Fiesta Burrito smothered in Salsa and Sopes Benedict with Masa boats filled by seasoned Beef, carefully poached Eggs, housemade Ranchero Sauce and Avocado.  Focusing on items marked as \"BYC Favorites,\" many of these recipes dating back four decades, it was after splitting a warm Blueberry Muffin that attention turned to a Belgian Waffle halved and stacked around Bacon, Egg and Cheese, a touch of Real Maple Syrup from home pushing flavor even further while a $10.95 Acai Bowl takes the \"Superfood\" in a new direction by offering it as tangy Sorbet surrounded by Fresh Berries, Coconut and Granola.    Not about to pass on French Toast and Pancakes, the latter offered solo or stacked in seven varieties including Gluten Free, those unafraid to indulge are highly encouraged to order swirled Cinna-Cakes drizzled with Vanilla Icing, and although \"Crunchy French Toast\" looks better on the menu than it does as plated the flavor is still excellent - though not quite on the level of Tiki Toast that perfectly suit's \"The Ninth Island\" with thick slices of Hawaiian Bread, Berries and Caramel Sauce.  FOUR STARS:  Although Henderson continues to show-up the West side in terms of Breakfast and Brunch, The Broken Yolk Cafe's recent arrival at Town Square gives those who don't like to cross The Strip something to be excited about. Imported from San Diego, but locally owned, consider this a great alternative to Egg & I or Cracked Egg with more creativity and better service at a similar price-point.",

Parking is behind Fry's and is shared in a limited lot with a nail shop and Cafe Rio in front but they do have additional on the side.   Seating in booth were comfy. Bar seating by the entrance. Patio seating available.   ---Vegas Mule Cocktail-My guest ordered the Vegas Mule cocktail and said it was tasty but wasn't too strong. I guess he wanted more buzz in the morning.  ---Sope Benedict was nice and traditional flavors. Only reason why it's considered a benny is the poached egg but it was good the way it was meaning I could want it on a English Portion was great and I had it accompanied with beans. The beans complimented very well.  ---Caprese Benedict was also very traditional in expectation which made it comforting. Clean presentation and nice thick mozzarella  ---Stuffed Banana French Toast was a nice choice. The mascarpone in between slices paired with banana was perfect together. Very reminiscent of bananas foster with the flavors and we were a big fan of this sweet option.   We were checked on my management and our waitress made sure to check on us appropriately throughout the meal. I would like to try a few more of their signature dishes for sure.",

    "text": "We heard about this place during teacher appreciation week and decided to drive across town to go check it out. The biggest complaint I have and why they didn't get 5 stars, was because of the service. The service, I'd only give 2 stars to. We waited a good 15 minutes before anybody ever came up to us to ask us what we would like to drink. I don't feel that is acceptable. And even then, it wasn't our waiter, it was a guy that was cleaning off the tables around us. At the time we got there, it wasn't busy at all, only a few tables of people. There shouldn't have been a long wait for drinks. Eventually we got our drinks, (that also took awhile) and no one came back to take our orders. A waitress walking by, we stopped and mentioned that nobody has come to take our order and she was nice enough to take our orders. Throughout the time we were there, we still didn't get very good service. It's a shame that the service wasn't good. We had high hopes for this place since we took the tie to drive so far to check it out.  On a positive note...the food. The food was amazing! I saw a picture of the chicken and waffles benedict and knew I HAD to try it. Who combines these two amazing meals? They do and it is definitely worth it. They took two of my favorite foods and made them into one! I didn't however like the potatoes that came with them. They tasted bland, definitely needed some seasoning or something. My husband had the crunch french toast and that was also pretty delicious. We decided since it was Sunday, why not have a drink with our breakfast? I decided to try the mimosa flight because I love mimosas and it was actually pretty good. A good variety of flavors. They also have a bloody mary flight too, but my husband tried the bloody best instead because he wanted the one with the waffle and bacon in it. He said it was really good.",

    "text": "We were really looking forward to trying this new breakfast restaurant out. It was Mother's Day and we expected a crowd and a wait. It was nice to have a message system to let us know where we were in the queue. It was also a great touch to have water, coffee and muffins outside for those waiting for a table. The great part is we only waited 16 minutes for a table.  Once inside we were seated and drink orders were taken. Our waitress was very nice and patient while we made our menu choices. I ordered the Country Skillet; my wife ordered the Original Benedict; my daughter had a short stack of pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage; and my son have make your own omelet with fresh fruit. After she took our order we knew it would probably be awhile because it was so busy, but never thought we would have to wait as long as we did. It was about 45 minutes after our order was taken before we got our food. The couple next to us came in after us, ordered, ate and left long before we even got our meals. I think they had made ours then somehow forgot about it. You could kind of tell by the state of my wife's Eggs Benedict. The Hollandaise Sauce was all congealed on top like it had been sitting awhile, and there wasn't enough. Her eggs were also hard, as were mine, even though they were supposed to be over medium. My daughter's pancakes were dense to say the least (not at all light and fluffy) and she could only eat about a quarter of them. My Country Skillet was very good despite the eggs being too hard. My son's omelet was good and he enjoyed it.  Overall between the long wait for our food, the quality of the food and a higher than necessary price point it will be awhile before we come back, if at all. With all of the great 6-3 breakfast/lunch places in the area this will unfortunately be one of our last choices. We were just hoping for a better experience. Let's hope that they can get some of what appears to be growing pains out of the way soon, so that this place with a lot of potential can succeed.",

The hosts and servers were all friendly and the restaurant was clean; decor was super cute!  Portions are HUGE and totally share-able.    We ordered the Tiki Toast and the Mom Omelette (1 sweet and 1 savory dish)!   The Tiki toast was my absolute favorite - it's a french toast made from hawaiian bread topped with strawberries, coconuts and blueberries. The crunchiness of the outside had the perfect balance for the soft inside of the french toast. I highly recommend trying the Tiki Toast (it went perfect with my carmel latte).   Prices are very reasonable given the big portion size - will come back again! :P",

Now to the food.  We had a turkey sandwich/ salad combo, crunchy French toast and a chicken wrap with sweet potato fries.  All of the food was excellent.  My daughter loved the turkey sandwich and the French toast was crispy but soft in the middle.  The fries were nice and hot.  Great place with great service and not a buffet",

We had to ask another server to get us drinks, as our waitress was MIA. We waited another 25 minutes to place our food order, and had to ask where she was again to get that done. No one checked on us, or even asked if everything was okay. If the place was busy, yeah I can excuse this, but it was EMPTY. The food was meh, the prices okay. No free drink refills on many selections that are free at far better places. We will not be back. Maybe the ones elsewhere are better that they deserve 5 stars, this one, not so much.

My steak was ordered medium rare. It came, well,... well done would be giving the cooks some credit. It was toasted. Matthew took a look and said it was far from medium rare. He wanted to replace it. When it came, it was RAW! Not undercooked, RAW. It went back for try three. Came back and it was still raw. Matthew went to talk with the manager, Jim, who was hanging out at the front desk. Didn't come to talk to us. Matthew went to him again. Still no response. He looked at our table and then ducked into the kitchen. Matthew was apologetic. Why is a server needing to apologize for a manager than is willing to cash his paycheck, but throws his staff under the bus and ignore customer issues? Matthew ended taking it off the check since Jim was MIA and unwilling. Matthew asked we come back and ask for him so he could make up for it. Sorry Matthew, but I am hesitant since your boss, Jim, is still the guy running the show. If he can't address the most basic managerial tasks, I am fearful of another attempt where food, service and issues are left up to a person that is either incapable, or unwilling, to right wrongs.",

    "text": "First time trying this place, more than likely the last. My wife and I wanted to try something new with the kids so last Saturday we got up early and headed down did something we rarely do (head to LV Blvd.). Upon arrival all was good there was, no wait and initially the staff seemed friendly. Then the food came.... let me start off by saying from the time we ordered to the time the food hit our table your talking less than 5 minutes. Already we were a little skeptical, being we ordered several dishes all of which would take sometime to cook fresh. The Huevos Rancheros, Golden State Benedict, Stuffed French toast and eggs and bacon for the baby. The time it took for them to serve our food suggested that virtually nothing was made to order. The Huevos Rancheros were luke-warm and that was accompanied with dry/hard rice and cold beans thankfully they heated up the tortillas (15 sec. in a microwave). The Stuffed French toast was cold which was understandable given the qty of filling however the French toast itself was just two pieces of bread lightly toasted with some cinnamon. My son joked that \"technically it was stuffed toast, they forgot the French part\". The bacon reminded me of the mass produced/drowning in grease bacon you get at a Carnival Cruise buffet. Finally we come to the Golden State Benedict, who out there has ever tried cold Hollandaise sauce? It's interesting, even more so when eaten with two almost Hard Boiled eggs underneath it. The cooks were kind enough to add a side that was supposed to be hashbrowns, sadly they more closely resembled and tasted like cold mashed potatoes. Like I said the staff seemed nice enough and if your looking for a breakfast that doesn't require actual cooking I wouldn't detour you. There were plenty of dinners eating yogurt and fruit bowls that looked pleased. It is obvious that most items are cooked in advance resulting in a sub par breakfast experience considering A. the location and B. the numerous amazing breakfast restaurants in the area. Las Vegas is a haven for amazing chefs/cooks young and old, a mecca of food Breakfast to Dinner. I truly hope my experience was a fluke one off",

The first couple of times I went within a month of opening and everything was great.  Five stars.  However the past couple of visits the service has really plummeted.  The food is still really good, however it is very apparent that after the first month of being open they severely cut back on the number of servers.  There are very few servers to a full restaurant and as a result, the service suffers.    Again, the food, amazing. But be ready to wait. Multiple times, because they are busy and will forget.",

I got a mimosa with orange juice and got my boyfriend the strawberry banana smoothie. Loved both of the drinks. I wanted to try the flight mimosa but I felt like it was too much for this early morning for me. For food we ordered the waffle sandwich and the breakfast tacos. Wow it was big portions and delicious! I would recommend sharing here because we didn't get to finish our meal, it was a lot of food but it was so yummy! The inside of the restaurant was vibrant and bright which created the perfect ambiance. We sat in the back booth and it was a delightful brunch. Highly recommend this place",

Location, Location, Location. Oh, and a nail place under construction next door. Breakfast and manicures with friends this is where you'll want to be. Now on to the food. I have only visited during breakfast and have sampled their chicken and waffles and California Omelette. Both were quite good. Each time I have dined here has been quite pleasant. The food is good, service attentive, pleasant ambiance and great location for locals and tourists. I will be back to sample more delectable meals hopefully very soon!",

Tons of room to bring your biggest groups to. The servers were crazy nice and very helpful. I think someone had spilled OJ under the table we were seated at. My shoes stuck to the floor like I was in a movie theater. I mentioned it to the server and he was over with a wet rag in a heartbeat to clean it up.  The table top was spotless, and 2 seconds later we had cups of some great tasting coffee hitting down in front of us. We ordered and the food was out crazy fast. I had a traditional 2 egg breakfast. The portions were hefty. Had the hash browns not been so perfectly cooked I might have been able to stop eating before my gut felt ready to pop.  The coffee was always hot and fresh and we left full and happy!  The menu has tons of great options that will be sure to cover even your pickiest eaters! Give it a try!",

This time it was horrible, total Flat Tire.  All three.  The steaks were bad cuts, only about 1/3 was edible and my medium rare was well done.  The place was super busy this time but that is not an excuse.  My 5 star just went down 2 stars because of this.  I imagine that this place might be hit or miss, but...  IDK give it a try, the first experience was great, try them when there not too busy??  Oh ya, even the sides were not that great this time, my refried beans were old and crusty, eggs were over cooked on one side and runny on the other side.  Just bad all around.

I had the two eggs breakfast and the eggs were relatively small...little disappointing.    I was able to get a substitute of french toast instead of regular toast which was very good.  Place puts a high emphasis on alcoholic drinks which I didn't get.  They also have healthier items on the menu, but judging by the girth of many of its customers, I don't think these were that popular.   I love breakfast and this was a decent choice.  I feel that First Watch and Snooze execute this concept better but they are not in this market.    Might give it another try.",

I got the Border Benedict, which was exactly what I had hoped for. Reminded me of a Benicio del Porko I'd eaten elsewhere. This place is a perfect spot for a Saturday/Sunday brunch. No doubt one of the best new brunch spots in Las Vegas.  Perfect Sunday Funday before a Las Vegas Aces WNBA game just down the road...oh, and mimosas galore!",

I ordered basically a build my own S.B.A. Which is an omelette with bacon, asparagus, spinach and cheddar cheese. I substituted the cheddar cheese with goat cheese, so much better and made it egg whites, so good!!! Barry who is a manager came by just to say Hi!  Friendly atmosphere and the team can handle high-volume of customers still with a smile!! Kudos to all!! Very good!!!! June 9th- Ruben is excellent and awesome, kind and great all the way around.  This my second time with Ruben! This time a Hash Skillet, amazing too. 4th meal and each one has been great here!  Always busy so have patience for the waitress, cooks and servers! It's well worth it!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group with high Hope's, the reviews made it easy to pick. The food took FOREVER and not once did someone come to the table to explain or apologize even though the table behind us got an apology and an explanation from (Jackelyn, Manager).  We felt discriminated after the server (Mathew) and the Manager (Jacklyn) walked by us multiple times with out checking on us, I was ready to walk out. The food finally arrived after waiting for about an hour not including the 30 minute wait outside the restaurant. Honestly I don't see why pre cooked food took so long red rice, beans, machaca meat, soup you can literally just reheat that and the things that are made on the spot eggs, club sandwich... how long does that take to prep? It would've made a difference if the food was great but unfortunately it's just the hype because my soup came with the cabbage hanging over like a wet sock on the edge like they served it with a super soaker. The fries and club sandwich were good but the soup unfortunately was so salty that it was inedible, I poured some of the water I had as a drink to make it somewhat enjoyable. After telling Mathew he just took it away and offered to remove it from the check, normally at other places that's when the manager comes with their tail tucked between their legs with an apology but we got nothing! Please excuse my French but Jackelyn was a rude, racist bitch! My cousins onion rings were pale and under cooked and after she requested to be cooked more like an onion ring should feel and look, Jackelyn came with the rings and sarcastically asked \"who ordered the extra crispy rings\"... she seemed annoyed with our presence from the beginning. We left with out leaving a tip and I left a note that said \"Shit food, Shit service\" and as we walked out the manager and the rest of the clowns including a chunky girl with black shirt and glasses and Mathew looked out the window and laughed after sharing the note I left so I flicked a quarter towards the door so they can fetch!  Whoever owns this place, I would get rid of the racist cunts because bad food is one thing I can move on but feeling discriminated in a place that serves Mexican food is a joke!  Next time I'll just get Taco bell and deal with shits instead.",

We said yes & a confirmation text got sent to us. that was first step to great service. Then we received amazing service from josh & jaclyn. Even though Josh was new, he knew all the information we asked him. Very friendly & ontop of his game. We ordered the club sandwich, tiki french toast, hash skillet & a bottle of mimosa. Everything was great from the atmosphere, food, service. would highly recommend!!",

The extra thick slices of bread are crunchy from the frosted flakes (picture attached). I also had a regular mimosa. The seating area was clean and the staff was friendly. The only negative I have for this place is that it took nearly a half an hour for my order to be taken. Other than that, I would recommend this place to others.",

One lady asked if I wanted some more water and I said yes but she never came back. So I asked another server if I could have some water and they said yes but never came back. So I just got up and got the water myself. Then, our server just brought our check without asking if we wanted anything after we finished our food. Not that I actually wanted anything afterwards but it was hella rude to not ask and just straight bring the check. Like what if I wanted to order something to go. Maybe I'm just being hella picky about it cuz I used to be a server back in the day, but I would never let my customers drink get empty and I would always ask if they wanted or needed anything before I brought the check. #brokenyolk #grubbin #needsbetterservice",

The atmosphere is perfect, and I like that it's located off the strip.. it tends to be less crowded then. I suggest if you're nearby this cafe to stop in for some mind blowing breakfast. The eggs were cooked exactly how I asked for them. We ordered the blueberry muffins and they were great to even take on the road, heat up, and eat as a snack later in the day. The hashbrowns were browned on the top and cooked less under which leaves a great taste when you add hot sauce on them :) overall pleased with my experience here and would LOVE to go back!",

Sparking nostalgic feels as if I was hanging by the Pier again while watching the waves.    We went on Mother's Day. It was about a 45 min wait (which is expected to be since it just opened and it's a holiday). So don't knock them down until everything gets ironed out. They use a phone-text feature to notify you when you're next, in case you wanted to leave and come back. I really like that they had a coffee and water station outside for people waiting and plenty of bench seats. A plus for customers. There were even little mini muffins! More points.    The ambiance and interior design are really nice. Very roomy, airy, and spacious. Large groups will not be an issue. Food was great! We had the El Fuego omelet and the Hash Skillet. Got a side of strawberry banana smoothie because it looked oh-so-refreshing. There are plenty of food choices from light and healthy down to heavy and food coma. Best known for their eggs benedicts, french toasts, and omelets. So look into that.   What's ideal about Broken Yolk's location at the corner of Town Square, is it's next to lots of upcoming restaurants and shops. In addition, it is minutes away from the airport! So for you visitors out there that are arriving in or leaving. Look no further, this place has breakfast and lunch, mimosas, and a full bar! Great way to start or end your Vegas vacation.",

    "text": "A hidden gem located in Townsquare shopping plaza. After reading the reviews and looking through the pictures, I knew that this place would be amazing for brunch with friends.  My friend and I arrived around 12:00 for a late brunch on Wednesday. I was surprised to see the dining area full. We were greeted and sat right away by the host. From acai bowls to burger, the Broken Yolk Cafe has all your typical breakfast and lunch favorites.  My friend ordered the steak and eggs which came with choice of either home fries, hash browns, fresh fruit, Mexican rice or refried beans. Then you get the option to pick from a biscuit, blueberry muffin, English muffin, tortillas or toast.  I decided to go with something different from my usual eggs and bacon. I went with the Baja breakfast tacos, which came with two corn tortillas filled with beef chorizo sausage, scrambled eggs, and avocado with homemade salsa and cotijia cheese. Mexican rice and black beans were served on the side, but since I am not a fan of beans I opted in for more rice. Overall, I am super impressed with this place. I highly recommend visiting if you're near or shopping at Townsquare.",

Walking in, I was greeting by an amazing host who was super friendly, wish I caught her name. I was then seated by an even likewise server. Everyone here is super friendly and actually seems like they want to work there.   Although, friendliness can only go so far. Even though we were in this positive atmosphere, the food was at most, iHop level. In actuality, I think I would've preferred iHop more.   While sitting down, two altercations erupted between a customer and waiter. One customer was asked to be carded multiple times for alcohol and then there was a big scene, alarming the guests. Right in that same minute, another woman's food was incorrect and it took them a long amount of time to get the correct food. Maybe it was just a bad day for the cooks, but those both set off alarms as a customer looking to try something new. The store manager had to be called to both these guests tables and had to de-escalate the situation.   All in all, had a lot of potential. Probably not coming back. Maybe if the food was re-amped and wasn't as stale, I would recommend.",

    "text": "Nice looking new breakfast spot located at Town Square, near Total Wine. We've been patiently awaiting the grand opening. Open for breakfast and lunch only. Whilst waiting to be seated, we were next to the bar and saw plenty of drinks beverages being prepared. The bloody looked delicious with bacon and a waffle on top.  We waited about 15 minutes and were seated at a booth.  Rusty was our server and was very cordial and pleasant. The mimosa flights looked tasty so ordered up one of those. The drinks weren't very cold so popped in an ice cube from our waters. Guess they were behind or overwhelmed today. Overall nice flight with orange, grapefruit, pomegranate and a mix of grapefruit and cranberry.  We perused the menu and they have plenty of items that sound tasty, like the crunchy French toast covered in corn flakes and the waffle sandwich. We chose the Hash skillet 5/5, home fried potatoes sauteed with corned beef hash, onions and peppers topped with cheddar cheese, eggs your way and bacon...YUM!  We also ordered the fiesta burrito and Rusty was quick to let us know how the burrito was: the fiesta burrito \"is like a party in your mouth!\" SOLD! Now we had to try it. Amazing and lived up to the party 5/5. Get extra salsa verde, the shredded beef burrito topped with fresh avocado was good to the last shared bite!  They had some sweet and savory selections, next time we will get one of each and share. Thank you for a very good brunch, can't wait to come back again.  Tip: they offer 10% Military / Veteran discount.",

We went on a Sunday around 1pm and put ourselves on the online waiting list, so when we arrived, we only waited a few minutes. But I imagine the wait is much longer earlier in the day. There were a bunch of people waiting inside and outside.  We had the Tiki Toast, which was described as grilled Hawaiian sweet bread with fruit, coconut and caramel drizzle. I honestly couldn't tell it was sweet bread, and the texture was inconsistent - some parts were mushy, other parts dry. Not a lot of flavor, definitely needed syrup. We also ordered the John Wayne omelet (mushrooms, onions, cheese, topped with chili). It was good, not great, but I really liked the blueberry muffin that came with it.  Service was also just okay. Our server came over quickly after we sat down, but it was our first time and they have a large menu, so it took us a while to decide (maybe 7-8 minutes). Our server literally came by 3 times to take our order. We had our noses buried in the menu, so you'd think she'd see we weren't ready yet. We had to ask for drink refills and at the end of the meal, we waited about 10 minutes for her to pick up our credit card.   I'd probably go back to give them another chance, but I wouldn't wait more than a few minutes.",

After 45 minutes, we were finally seated. The menu is huge with something for everyone. We also took advantage of the liquor menu. We got a bucket of champagne for mimosas with pineapple and orange mixers and I got a frozen Tipsy Joe which was absolutely delicious. For my meal I got the recommended fiesta burrito and it did not disappoint! I love green sauce so that made it even better. Despite being busy, food came out quickly. Great service and staff!",

Las Vegas Blvd, is a new eatery serving up some awesome food.  The space is very clean and has a modern flair.   It was Saturday when I visited and we waited about 45 minutes for 6 people.  But the line for a wait was hella long and I just thought of it as a popular spot...no biggie.  When we were finally sat, we were greeted by a very enthusiastic waitress. She took my sons order immediately cuz he had to leave.  We ordered after a few minutes and my sons order was on the table in about 15 minutes. That was awesome. Some of the food we ordered were Huevos con Chorizo, Chicken Fried Steak, Tuna Melt, French Toast with a side of bacon, and The Crunchy French Toast (combo with eggs and bacon). OMG. I HIGHLY recommend the Crunchy French Toast...bomb.   Partway through our service, I noticed the wait staff running around more than I usually notice while dining.  So I mentioned to our waitress \"wow you guys are busy\" and that's when she told me it was their opening weekend.   So to their credit, when you come visit this awesome place, be patient. The staff is still working out bugs and I'm sure the rough edges will smooth out. I highly recommend this place for brunch or whatever tickles your fancy.",

    "text": "Welcome to Las Vegas Broken Yolk!!!  This location was dishing out food very quickly, and the food came out super fresh.  The kitchen staff is efficient and is dishing out some delicious food.   I highly suggest the country fried steak -- it will give any other breakfast place in Las Vegas a run for it's money.  At $11, it's a hell of a steal for the huge chicken fried steak, fresh and crispy hash browns, egg-cellently cooked eggs (I mean, it is called broken yolk!) and a really good Blueberry muffin.  The country fried gravy sauce is the boss! Soooo Good - I'm drooling thinking about it right now.  I also highly suggest getting some of their mixed drinks.  The prices are reasonable and they're using top shelf alcohol.  They keep them nice and strong too.  Other suggestions are:  the Tiki Toast (a great finisher for the table.  Crispy, sweet, airy, oh man...)  The Chilaquiles: The chips remain pretty crispy and are covered in delicious salsa and cheese.  I'm not sure what they do to their beans and rice, but they would give mexican restaurants a run for their money.    The NoName Omelette was very tasty as well.  Light, but packed with the ingredients and my favorite - bacon.  The eggs are not overcooked, which is a typical issue with omelettes at other places.  This place knows their eggs!  If you're not in the alcoholic mood, the orange juice is freshly squeezed and tastes like you got it at a farmers market.  Pomegranate juice is also an excellent hangover cure.  The service was excellent as well.  My party had Rusty, and he was always checking in on us and making sure that our drinks were never empty.  He was always very prompt in making sure that we got our stuff and was very attentive.  He had great knowledge of the menu as well.  Thanks Rusty!  Stop by and try Broken Yolk.  You will not be disappointed! One of my favorite places for breakfast.",

    "text": "Visiting from California for the week and we stopped here for breakfast. When we got here the hostess told us 15-20 minutes for a table for two. This was confusing because there was an entire wall of open booths as well as taller tables available for parties of two. We gave our phone number and sat to wait.   Once we got seated, our server Matthew came over with two waters in his hand. We had been sitting long enough to check out the menu and decide what we wanted to order. We ordered our food and then he asked us if we wanted anything else to drink. We ordered a Tipsy Joe to share between the two of us, one of the frozen coffee cocktails I assume? We never got it. He checked both of our ID's and made small talk about the taste of the drink. He had the handheld device in his hand putting in our orders so I'm confused where he went wrong. After he put everything in, or so we thought, he walked away and was not to be seen again until much after our food had been delivered.   Our food came out, and there was no quality check or water refills. We still didn't have our drink. Then an older gentleman in glasses and a button up, assuming the manager, brought over two mimosa flights. We didn't order mimosa flights. The man kept saying \"13? For table 13?\" To Matthew. On our check, it did say table 13. Matthew told the man that it was so funny, someone must have just put in those drinks under his number and our table. He's right, hilarious. NOT. How did someone else ring in two mimosa flights for his table? Under his number? When he had the handheld device in front of him? Unlikely. After we refused the mimosa flights, more time went by before Matthew finally came by to ask us what drink we ordered. (Because he never put it in!) Again I would like to bring up the fact that he had the handheld POS in front of him at the table when we ordered.   The food wasn't bad. It could have been served hotter but otherwise it tasted good. Wasn't spectacular but it wasn't awful. After we had finished eating, we sat for about ten minutes looking for Matthew with him nowhere in sight. When he appeared again, he ignored us and sat to chat with the table next to us. He was there for 5 minutes while we were still waiting for boxes and a check. A bus boy noticed we looked ready to go and he came to clear our plates and give us the boxes we needed. We had to ask him for our check as well. He asked who the server was.   Matthew FINALLY brought the check to us. He looked it over before he set it down and then confirmed it was ours. This is important because the check given to us still had a mimosa flight on it. He walked back to the other table to chat them up again and we were left waiting AGAIN to tell him the check was wrong. When I brought it up to him about the mimosa flight, he insisted someone else put it there. Regardless of who put it there, while it's incredibly unlikely that someone else did, it was still on our check that he looked over before dropping off. When he had to fix it, he brought back the handheld POS and told us our new total and then made a joke about how expensive the mimosa flights are. So I am sure he can understand why we didn't want that on our check ESPECIALLY because we didn't order or receive them.   Overall, the restaurant was nice and clean. The hostess with the ginger hair and the French braids super friendly and doing a great job by herself. Otherwise, Matthew's service was slow and lackluster. We had high hopes for this place.

Both things were amazing! The eggs were fluffy but not too light and the pancake was crunchy on the outside but hot and soft on the inside. The manager was walking around greeting everyone, I mentioned to him that I really wanted to try the crunch French toast. Ten minutes later, he came back with some! He said they had just gotten the ingredients and brought it to our table... amazing! Definitely will come back!",

The potato's in my food were burnt and made the whole meal subpar. Plus they had way too much gravy on it. After that, one of the people I was with found lipstick stains stuck on her cup. And when we brought this to the attention of the server, she laughed and said \"oops\" then walked away. She came back with a new one but in this one there was food particles and residue on the inside of the cup. It was disgusting and not okay. This is an fairly new restaurant and if it had been one isolated incident it would be fine but when the second cup that was brought to us also had dirt from past uses we all stopped eating. The service was not terrible but the food and drinks were anything but good. We will not be coming back.",

Got a few dessert dishes to share -- cinnacake (cinnamon pancakes) & Nutella crepes-- and a waffle sandwich for myself, & he got the chilaquiles (he said it was the best he's ever had).

The waffle sandwich was also quite tasty-- eggs were fluffy & bacon had just the right amount of crisp.   This will definitely be my go-to breakfast for off-strip Vegas in the future!",

We even had a conversation about why. Burrito arrives with bacon anyway. The rice and beans tasted like they were out of a box. Not saying that they were,  but they sure tasted like it.   Our water glasses were never refilled.  The place has a nice clean design with lots of natural lighting. But all those reflective surfaces also make it loud. A crying child on the other side of the restaurant made it almost impossible to have a conversation.",

Anyhow, after 3 nights in Vegas hubby and I were on our way out of Sin City until we realized omg we haven't eaten! Located just a couple of miles down from the strip we decided to stop by. This was just last month in August  When we first arrived to the place there was already a good amount of people there. The decor was all so very cute and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Our server was upbeat and welcoming! We were immediately seated, given our menu and offered \"mimosas\" if that's not a great way to start I don't know what is!   I ordered the no name omelette which consisted of bacon, avocado, mushroom, onions, while hubby got a skillet. My eggs tasted amazing along with my fresh avocado! Nothing was over cooked and my hash browns were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Hubby and I were really impressed with overall quality and quantity and not to mention a great price!   If we stop in Vegas we will definitely be back for breakfast! If you want somewhere off the strip or even if you are a local check out this place!",

My kids had chocolate chip pancakes and unless you are a huge eater the half Ortiz more than enough for an adult.  I had a Mamosa and it was made well I loved that they don't drowned it in orange juice. And for 8 dollars I felt it was a good value. This is my new go to breakfast spot in Las Vegas",

This new-ish brunch spot amidst the hustle and bustle of Town Square makes for the perfect place to indulge in a flight of mimosas alongside an omelet and catch up with your social circle or prep for some midday shopping. Conveniently located right off the southern end of Las Vegas Blvd within my favorite local shopping complex, Broken Yolk offers a wide selection of delicious eats and beverages suitable for parties of all kinds, whether you're day-drinking or out for lunch with the fam.   A note to the gluten-sensitive - you're in luck. The menu even includes gluten-free pancakes, a rare luxury that I hope turns out deliciously for you!  As for my recommendations? Do yourself a solid and indulge in the Nutella Crepes with both bananas AND strawberries with an Arnold Palmer on the side.",

He told us that they opened about two months ago and he is glad that we visited them that day.  The food is good and delicious and made fresh, as they always do based on past visits, albeit in San Diego. They also serve cocktails early in the morning which is an added bonus.  I recommend this breakfast place to locals and visitors alike. It's close to the Airport so stop here first as soon as you land! Enjoy!!",

That way, you don't have to stand there and wait. You can go around exploring Town Square and do some shopping. Or you could be like us and walk on over to Total Wine to look at their selection of beer   The Broken Yolk came from San Diego and they have items on the menu that are influenced by flavors from the border, which makes them really unique.   Except, my party usually has a tough time deciding on what they want to eat so it took a while. I ended up getting their crunchy french toast, which is french toast with cereal flakes on the outside. My husband went with their blueberry pancakes and my friend got the border benedict and belgian waffle.  The food didn't take long despite how busy and packed they were. My french toast was actually very tasty. I really like the addition of the cereal flakes, which give it a contrast in texture. My husband's pancakes were okay -- I'm not a fan of pancakes so I actually did not have an opinion. I tried some of the meat on my friend's benedict and I actually really liked the flavor/seasoning of it. The waffle was a waffle.   Overall, good food. Some of it is pricier than it should be but that's a lot of breakfast/brunch places so it's normal. Nice flavors and unique items. I wouldn't mind coming back to try some other things on the menu.   TIP: Make sure your waiter/waitress repeats your order back to you. My husband had wanted the full stack but the waitress only heard short stack. At least the bill was correct. Just double check before your server leaves the table!",

    "text": "Came here for brunch one day as best friend had mentioned this place opening in Town Square by Total Wine (alchy...). Originally we had planned to go to Truffles and Bacon but decided against it because of the possibility of a dish being too sweet. LOL.   I had arrived around 11AM and had saw the line out the door, reaching half way across the building, towards Cafe Rio. Omg. I parked and stood in line. A friend and her husband had came out and said i needed to check in. So I did, 10 minutes later. Oops? Didn't get an approximate wait time but saw on the tablet it was 60-75 minutes. With the text system, it just says it will contact you when table is ready. We ended up walking to Total Wine (....alchys....) to kill time. About 30 minutes later, got a text stating table was ready. Walked in and was sat almost immediately.   As always, we have decision issues. LOL Took a while to decide what to get. Waitress had left from our indecisiveness to help another table real quick before coming back to us to take our order.  I had ordered the \"Border Benedict\" which was poached eggs and seasoned carne asada atop two sweet corn cakes, smothered in homemade poblano sauce  Overall, this was pretty good. The poached eggs were nicely cooked, mildly more than I expected though. The carne asada was decent. Good flavor. The poblano sauce was mild but had a nice flavor. Unfortunately, the two sweet corn cakes were SUPER HARD and DRY. I'm ok with corn bread or similar, when its fresh and softer, but this was as hard as a rock. It was hard to even cut through with a knife.   Also had ordered a \"Belgian Waffle\" plain w/ powdered sugar and whipped butter  This Belgian waffle was pretty decent ! I was afraid it was going to be dense. I've seen some places use like a thick ball squished into the waffle maker but this was nothing like that. Crispy outside. Nice and light on the inside. Mild amount of powdered sugar and the whipped butter was nice and light as well. Nice side to share. Probably one of the better waffles i've had in a long while !  Friends had ordered a \"Blueberry Short Stack\" and \"Crunchy French Toast\"   The \"Crunchy French Toast\" includes three extra thick slices of bread rolled in crunchy frosted flakes, sprinkled w/ sliced almonds, raspberries, and powdered sugar, topped w/ whipped cream and a raspberry drizzle  This was quite interesting. Large portion. The frosted flakes and almonds adds a nice texture and flavor to it all. It was a bit sweet, but not bad. Would be great with a cup of coffee HEHE   Blueberry pancakes.... well... its pancakes... i can't say much about it cuz most pancakes are dead to me. LOL   Overall, pretty decent place. Despite the long line, the wait wasn't bad. The location is pretty spacious with some outdoor seating too. Would like to come back to try other things",

    "text": "Let's meet for brunch here at the Broken Yolk Cafe! Don't worry I won't break the yolks till you get here!!  The Broken Yolk is the newest flavor to be added to the collection of chaos here at Town Square. This is not your typical mall. It's more a menagerie of stores that are made popular by those of us whom frequent this area and call it home for shopping; both local and tourist alike.   Let's dive right into the menu, so it's a breakfast place. Why should I wait in line to eat at this place? What makes it so special? I could go to Denny's right! Wrong, but it is America; so if it's Denny's you crave by all means. If not then listen up for the why? Their might be a surprise quiz at the end. You want to get an A, Right ?! Unique and quirky names grace the covers of this sacred document that we will cover called the menu. First thing that we start with being brunch or breakfast is the coffee! Plus this cafe is in a few states with some built of following, check google for more information.  Coffee is easy and essential, so already the Broken Yolk rates high on my meter with such spins on the Caramel Macchiato with their dirty Caramel Macchiato. The Caramel Messy Macchiato comes hot or iced with all the dirtiness one would expect with extra caramel and whip flavor. The espresso is strong and that messy Macchiato looks just like that of the picture too! Wow !!  If it's breakfast with that newest simplicities of healthiness then this is the perfect place. All the calorie counts are listed on the menu very clearly. The menu is in full color with most of the food pictured in clear and concise wording. The menu especially breakfast is the largest portion of their menu. The menu is organized very throughly and planned beautifully. The names of some of the menu items. Let's pick John Wayne which is an Omelet which the Duke, would probably of eaten in his days here on Earth. The Dukes omelet has onion, cheese, mushrooms, and chili.   Anything one could be craving for breakfast can be attained here. Pancakes, waffles, French toast, crepes, biscuits and gravy!! Wow the list continues until breakfast coma sets in. I'm loving the spin and class that is being brought back to breakfast by the cafe here. Both indoor and outdoor seating exist in this little cafe. The cafe is truly \"cafe\" size too! If you are dining here on a Sunday usually their is an over an hour wait; at least! Unless you want to dine in the patio area which is covered by Umbrellas but has no air conditioning. It's beautiful to sit either outside or inside. While I prefer the outdoors and then you can enjoy your meal with less noise and other patrons so close in proximity to one another. Plus mimosas taste best on the patio!  The staff here are so amazing as they move through their days all is grand as they work. The boss and owner whom calls this business his home makes his rounds to ensure that the customers are all fairing well with their food choices. This place is so great that employees that work here eat here when not working. The energy and empowerment of the staff is phenomenal and so appreciated as I eat !  Now everything that I have had here has been amazing. Truly each item on the menu that I try continues to amaze and surprise. The crepes are fab and we ordered them with strawberries of course, with the other choice being banana. The strawberries are placed and packed inside of the crepe too. Then to top it off Nutella is drizzled over the top. What a way to have breakfast? Fresh strawberry crepes!!",

I loved the savory crepes I ordered, it has a Mexican twist because of the green sauce which was a good bite, very flavorful. I loved the filling; shredded chicken, jack cheese and corn. It was simple but delicious. My bf got the ranchero skillet and the breakfast tacos. He said both were delicious and the prevention was definitely beautiful. I wish the Arnold Palmer was a little sweet but it was natural and that's what counts. From the order being put in to the food coming out, was about a 15-20 minute gap which wasn't bad for a early Sunday. I'll be back!",

    "text": "On the way to Vegas, the hubs said that he found a breakfast place we can try out. The restaurant got its start in San Diego, and decided to bring their success (and delicious offerings) to LV.  The restaurant is about 15 minutes away from the strip, and it's located in a large commercial area, so there's PLENTY of parking. The restaurant itself is pretty big too.  The hubs had a Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and hash browns. Instead of their usual toast offerings, he asked for biscuits with a side of gravy (see why I said \"YES\"?). The biscuits were HUGE! They were freshly baked and so soft. The hubs seemed to enjoy the rest of the dish, but the biscuits definitely overshadowed everything else. We were, however, a bit disappointed with the gravy. We're both all for thick, country gravy, but this gravy looked like it had been sitting for a bit - it was so thick (almost clunky) that instead of drenching the biscuit and complimenting it with unctuous flavors, it kind of just plopped on top of the biscuits and just... kinda... sat there. I would have been put off by it, but I was too busy enjoying my selection.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles Benedict and the Bloody Maria. The waffles were definitely not as crisp as I would have liked them, but they're topped with chicken tenders and poached eggs. The eggs were a TAAAAAAD bit over, but overall, the dish was pretty delish~ The Bloody Maria was absolutely delicious as well - I told the hubs that the next time we're there, I'll have to try one of the other options they offer for Bloody Marys.   Or maybe I'll get the flight...  Then order my favorite for the meal.",

The food took over 35 minutes for three meals. The waitress messed up the billing and a added drinks that were not ours.   The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the fiesta burrito,  having fresh avocado helps anything taste better. I ordered the bloody Mary sampler, which just made the meal worse, but it was my fault for expecting more than what anybody that can Google can make at home.(15 bucks down the drain)  My wife ordered the border benidict, too sweet and dry, it looked nice. She ordered the Carmel iced coffee latte, they should have just given us a cup water and Carmel on the side( I recommend just go to Starbucks instead)  My son ordered the pancakes, really hard to mess up chocolate chip pancakes.",

So many brunch spots in Vegas feel crowded and claustrophobic but even though Broken Yolk was busy, I felt like I had space to breathe. There's plenty of natural light as well as tasteful decorations and TVs that were playing the Masters during my visit.  My waiter was Rusty and he provided excellent service! He was attentive and immediately provided my table with waters but still gave us plenty of time to order. He was also prepared with recommendations and had answers to all of our questions as well.  I got the American breakfast (eggs, toast, hash browns, sausage) and let me tell you, the hash browns especially were EXCELLENT! The real star of my meal was the mimosa flight though. It came with four different mimosas (Orange, grapefruit, apple, cranberry) for $12. I will be coming back for that bad boy asap! I also ordered a spiked strawberry lemonade which was delicious!  Already planning my next visit!",

A very nice break from the chaos of Vegas. Thank you Blanca and the rest of the cafe team.",

The waffle was quite stale. Ambiance was also average. There were waiters just standing around socializing and made it quite uncomfortable as they were staring at my girlfriend and I. Overall, 3 stars is an appropriate rating of this place. Would I recommend? No, stick with your traditional Egg Works.",

    "text": "Very good service and delicious food. Our server, Jon, was extremely friendly. I got the tiki toast which was Hawaiian bread that tasted very similar to French toast (very good) and a blueberry banana smoothie (also very good). The place was clean, which is always a big plus. The only negative was that when I googled the place and looked at popular times for eleven, it said that it wasn't very busy and there would be no wait. There were actually quite a few groups waiting when we got there a little before eleven. We ended up waiting 22 minutes. There was a water cooler outside and plenty of outside seating that happened to be in the shade so it wasn't bad just inaccurately listed online. However, I feel that that's not a fault of the restaurant. Would definitely visit again.",

We actually were able to visit there location in California a week prior to there soft opening and was a little disappointed and thought well lets give the Vegas spot a try since we were so excited there were coming to Vegas.  I am so glad we went, there food and service was great.  I had the Fiesta Breakfast Burrito and the Tiki French Toast, my husband had the steak and eggs.  Burrito was huge and topped with a green verde sauce which I loved.  They have a hot sauce there which I kept using because it was so good and went well with my burrito.  Our server was Jordan and she was so sweet and definitely will be requesting her on our next visit.  All around food and service was great, they have a really great menu for breakfast and lunch.",

My friend Barbara and I had the Tipsy Joe, a frozen coffee drink, which was so very good! It was recommended to me and it did not disappoint at all!!! Everyone loved the restaurant, the atmosphere, and the food!!!! We could not have been happier!!

The food was amazing, and it is great that they will bring you anything you might need to make your meal better.

We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with hash brown and a side with a blueberry muffin, the portion size was huge but didn't help with the flavor as there was none. My wife had the S.B.A and she said it was good, but nothing special. We were hoping to enjoy the Crunchy French Toast but our waiter forgot to enter it in, she even came to us and said it's at very big possibility that I never put in the order. Well thanks for letting us know Amanda that you forgot to place the order instead of apologizing. she came back at us with well to be honest your table isn't really my table! Then walked away.

I also expect a breakfast place to be able to make toast. They sent me out toast twice and both times it had zero browning and was soggy. I might have well had buttered stale bread. The picture is of the second attempt. May sound stupid but I feel the simple things are what show how good a restaurant is. Don't think I will be coming back as there are better breakfast places in Vegas that are much cheaper as well. Hope the tourist enjoy wasting their money.",

I looked over at the cooks and noticed they were not wearing hair nets which I highly recommend that they do. I also went to the bathroom and there was no soap available to wash my hands which means more than likely that the employees are not washing their hands properly which is another deep concern. I am writing this review to make others aware of the health and safety of this restaurant so that no one gets sick, the employees seem nice and I just hope that management can resolve these issues quickly.",

Did not disappoint! I ordered the crunchy French toast and my brother ordered the border Benedict! This is our new favorite place! We live close to Glendora so look forward to checking out that location too!",

New to the Las Vegas area a Southern California staple-mark. Do your self a favor. Drop in. If you don't like the wait. Call ahead for a 30 minute call ahead to be placed on the seating list. I mean 30 minutes in Vegas? You can live on the other side of town and show up to a table waiting on you! It's also very helpful on weekends. If not. Show up. Have a Mimosa or Bloody Mary flight at the full service bar while you wait. Or sample a good old fashioned draft beer.   When you get to your seat bring an appetite! Portions aren't here for the unhungry. It's like your grandmother throwing down. Always makes sure your full before you leave. The food is amazing.  Plus, the service. Can't beat it. Super friendly, respectful and super accommodating. They really have a dialed in program here. If the first meal of your day is truly your most important. You owe yourself a trip here.",

Clean bathrooms, plenty of seating, and good service all made this experience stand up to the broken yolk reputation. We did have to wait outside on a hot July day BUT they offer complimentary fruit infused water as well as coffee so it makes the wait super bearable. They put you on a waitlist via text and I was surprised to see when I checked in that it transferred to show in my yelp acct which was neat to be able to track our wait. I ordered steak and eggs and when my steak was a little redder than I liked I attempted to enjoy but I just couldn't. When I told my waiter he was beyond accommodating and the manager made sure he was right there to deliver my new plate. My whole dish was delicious and it's definitely not worth knocking down any stars. I also got to try the cinna cakes! I personally couldn't have eaten them by myself, they are super rich but they were delicious to try. As well as the.... I'm not sure what it's called...Banana Marscapone french toast, it was amazing! Good enough that I would order next time. I watched Jim make sure his team was picking up trash and making sure things were running great. Keep up the good work Jim and team, we will be back for sure!",

    "text": "My wife wanted to try this new restaurant out because of the reviews. We missed the brunch rush on a Sunday, but the tables still needed to be bussed. Although we didn't wait long to get seated, the tables should still have been ready.  The hostess sat us down but we waited nearly 10 mins before waitress #2 came to ask us for drinks. The waitress (#1) that was supposed to service our table was servicing another party. But prior to asking us for drinks, the waitress #2 took drink and food orders for a couple who sat adjacent to us that arrived after us. Down the aisle another group who arrived after us got their orders taken. Waitress #2 put our orders in at the same time as the couple.  The couple received their food within 10 mins while we were waiting for ours. Another 10 mins goes by and we flagged down a random waitress asking where our food was. The manager, Jim, stops by to apologize for our wait. After 5 mins later, our food arrives. The group down the aisle got their food, finished eating, and was about to pay before we started eating. Jim offered to pay for our meal for the mistake. Apparently there was something wrong with our ticket in the kitchen.  The couple next to us finished eating after we started eating. I think they rushed my wife's hash browns because it was barely brown and she said the potatoes were still crunchy. We flagged waitress #1 about the hash browns, and her excuse was \"order it extra crispy\". Mind you, my hash browns were perfectly cooked and crispy without having to tell the kitchen. Waitress #2 came to apologize about our tardy food; she said she put in the ticket at the same time as the couple. My wife and I already figured this out, and we thanked her. The hash browns were replaced and again Jim came by apologize again.  As for the actual food, minus my wife's hash browns, it was really tasty. It was too bad that it was clouded by the terrible service. Hopefully we decide to come back, and it will be a better experience.",

We arrived close to noon on a Saturday, and there was a decent line with a 15 minute wait- except we chose the bar so were seated immediately. Our friendly and efficient waitress gave good recommendations! We began with a mimosa flight- perfect tastes of each flavor- it was a delicious choice as we perused the large, colorful menu. I chose a \"Golden State Benedict\"- bacon, avocado, tomato, and 2 perfectly poached eggs with a siracha spiked hollandaise- absolutely amazing. My friend choose a breakfast taco that she compared to the flavors only previously experienced in Cancun. The meals are generously priced at less than $15 for a considerable portion of truly well-prepared food. When we were finished, we ordered blueberry smoothies for the road, and they were also fantastic. 5 stars all around.",

We went around 630am and they already had people filling up the restaurant. By the time we left the restaurant was almost completely full. It's very spacious and also good for large partys.  Border Benedict - is an absolute must try if you like eggs benedict. The potatoes were missing flavor, inwould recommend getting beans on the side goes well with the border benedict. Orange juice was great tasted fresh and very cold.  Pancakes - Very large sized pancakes but cooked perfect and great flavor.  Service - was great multiple members of staffed checked on our party and made sure that our drinks stayed full and made sure we were happy with our meal.

The make your own omelet is not a novel idea, however, the ingredients I included and the taste of the food is excellent.  Ground beef, potato and cheese omelet with a little tomatillo sauce and sour cream on the side is to die for!  I also love their breakfast potatoes, just like my mom used to make!

The pancakes are fluffy but are a little doughy for my personal taste.   The service...as good as the food is this is where this store really excels. Always greeted with a smile and they hired an AMAZING staff. Came in about two weeks ago and received superior service from Chelsea.

We have a Broken Yolk Cafe at home in Bakersfield and can't wait to try it out.",

Had the chicken and waffle eggs Benedict and was very pleased. Service was awesome and location is so new you can smell the paint.  Glad we found this location away from the chaos of the Las Vegas Strip (2 miles away) and didn't pay a resort price. Will definitely return when in Vegas.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and the skillet kept hot throughout the entire sitting. Typically i expect skillets to cool down as soon as i start digging in but it wasn't the case with this one. I love that! Friend ordered an omelet which aside from being loaded with goodies it also included a generous amount of fruit and a muffin on the side. Our waitress was very kind and welcoming, she gave us plenty of time to decide on what we wanted. The place is very open and there's plenty of seating throughout.",

    "text": "After seeing all the great reviews on open table andYelp, I was really excited to try this place. Me and the wife came in around noon on a Monday. If you're a local, you'll know what restaurant week is.   Anyhow we come in, hostess was friendly and interior was nice. Waitress came right away and took drink orders. Shortly after food order. When you order using the restaurant week menu, you order 3 courses up front. I order the acai scoop, wild west burger with sweet potato fries, and the nutella crepe. Wife gets acai scoop, golden state Benedict, and the cinna cake.  Acai scoops come out first. It was good. Wish it had some granola in it. Then what was weird was, they brought out our deserts next and said our food was coming out. (1st course plates still on table).  so we start eating them then 2 minutes after, our entrees come out. (1st course plates still on table) desert was ok. The cinna cake was ok. The crepe was pretty good.   We start eating our entrees. The Benedict  visually looked good. Wife cuts into it and...solid yolk! Cmon! 2nd egg, same thing. Burger was poorly put together and the tooth pick holding it together was not put in all the way through. Flavor was good, execution poor. The sweet potato fries were fire tho! Super good.   I would give this place a 2nd try because of all the great reviews. But this particular visit, I wasnt impressed",

Nope we're not the first customers, this place was already packed when we got there. In spite of the influx of customers, the staff are still all smiles and they are just radiating with positive energy. I wasn't able to take pictures as we've came from a 10-hour drive and we just want to sit and eat.  There was about a 15-minute wait when we arrived. No biggie because the staff keeps checking up on us within that 15-minute time.  My hubby ordered the Golden State Benedicts w/o the Sriracha but his food came out with Sriracha and the staff immediately gave my husband a new one the moment he informed the staff about it. I ordered the tuna sandwich-cesar salad-chicken noodle soup combo, for which I was served a Tomato Basil soup instead. The staff immediately gave me a cup of chxn noodle soup ones I informed them of the mistake and they also had me keep the tomato basil soup to try. Our kids ordered, pancakes, Chicken strips and nutella/strawberry crepes. The food taste so good and it even taste better with very nice poeple serving them.  The staff was very nice and accomodating. The manager checked on every customers. He also came to our table and chatted a little bit. This place is awesome with Awesome people and food. We are definitely recommending this place to our friends and family and this is gonna be our go to breakfast place everytime we're in town.",

    "text": "Ordered take out on Monday at around 11:05. At first they didn't pick up which I understand if someone else was on the line. The second time they picked up and I ordered Ham Scramble and the Acai Bowl. They said that my order would be ready in 15 minutes. Okay that's cool everything is all good but this is where everything went downhill. Arrived about 15 minutes later and paid and my food still wasn't ready. Before I could even pay, the workers were struggling to find my order because they put the wrong name down... When they found it, my food still wasn't ready. The girl said she'll go check on it but didn't come back. Asked a different worker how much longer and they told me let me go ask the manager like why do you need to ask the manager to know when my food that I ordered a long time ago over the phone to be done. She didn't even go and check or look for her manager. She literally just stood by the cash register the whole time. At this point I waited for over 30 minutes and my food ain't out and still I don't know how much longer. Thank god it came out 10 minutes later. So overall I waited 40 minutes for some scramble eggs with ham and ice cream like okay y'all really need that long to cook eggs?? I didn't even get an apology for waiting such a long ass time. Since they took so long the food better be decent. But it wasn't even edible. Scrambled eggs were a bit on the runny side. Toast were burnt. Like imagine being a restaurant that manage to burn such a simple dish like toast. The hash weren't even good. The acai bowl did not come in a BOWL like why include the BOWL in the name if the container it came in isn't even close to a BOWL. I checked it when and it was a sad melted mess probably because they took 40 minutes. At this point I don't even want to come back in and complain because it's probably gonna take them two decades to get it right. The Ham Scramble wasn't worth $8.95 and the Acai bowl is not worth $10.95 especially when I can go to Bowlology or VitalityBowls for better and cheaper bowls. I rather go to Metro Diner which is a totally better place compared to here. Can't believed I really wasted $9 for semi scrambled eggs and like five pieces tiny ass pieces of diced ham and $11 for ice cream soup that ain't serve in a bowl. Also, let's not forget the tax so I really paid like over$20 for this garbage. Never coming back here again.",

YES!!!!  There were only a limited number of the cards. Glad I got there when I did. Anywho, my server Bianca was very nice and knowledgeable being opening day. I ordered the Hash Skillet with my eggs over medium and Mother's Light IPA (or something like that not the cream soda kind). Food was delivered crazy quickly! Compared to some other places, the portion size was not as big, but is still good for the price and I couldn't finish it anyway.  I really enjoyed the skillet, only thing, I wish I had the option to order crispier potatoes, would have been better.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed my meal and the drink. Overall, I give the service 5 stars, from not just my server, Bianca, but other servers and Alexei, very, very nice young man. Glad, I live relatively close, I will definitely be back this week to get my FREE pancakes!!!!   Let me know what you think!",

My daughters LOVED their French toast sticks and loved the options on the kids menu. The Broken Yolk has earned its way into our Sunday breakfast rotation.",

The food was excellent, the service was fantastic and it was better than any buffet that you would go to on the strip!! No matter if you live in Las Vegas or you are from out of town like i was, this place is a must for breakfast or brunch. I will be coming back when i visit Las Vegas again!!",

It also seemed like she had a lot of tables to serve. The food took a very long time to come out and the waitress apologized and gave us free biscuits and a muffin. That was nice. When the food came out my friend's acai bowl was a quarter melted and they had to send back their poached eggs twice for being over cooked. Frustrating. Our waitress did take the eggs off our bill, which we appreciated. But all in all, we would never go back. We should've known never to stray from our favorite breakfast place...Babystacks.",

My son who is 12 figured he would order food off the kids menu being he wasn't to hungry but he order his eggs the same way he does at all restaurants and at home, over easy. The manger came over and was very rude about it and said my son would have to eat scrambled eggs. I asked can i order him an adult meal instead and he said no we will not serve him over easy eggs. We have gone to Cracker Barrel, ihop, Denny's, the cracked egg, egg works, etc. and Have never had this happen or anyone be this rude! We won't back!",

We were told around a 20 minute wait for two people and added to a text alert. After about 45 minutes of waiting and watching group after group of people that came much later than us get seated we asked how much longer. The hostess didn't know who we were and couldn't find us on the list. How is this even possible with an at least partially automated system? She kept asking people who they were and seemed very mixed up. She was also quite rude to us and most people that came. After waiting another 5 minutes we asked if were were up next. She said about 15 minutes as she was seating yet another group that came probably 30 minutes after us. We left at that point. We will never be coming back. We went over to the Lazy Dog at the other end of Town Square where we were politely greeted, sat immediately, and had a nice brunch/ lunch. There are much better options than the Broken Yolk for a weekend brunch.",
