    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for New Year's Eve and we were quite impressed with the food and ambience. We ordered quite a few items, the scallops, hanger steak, meat and cheese board, octopus, and the baked truffle ricotta. We got a couple drinks as well. The scallops were amazing, flavorful and tender. My boyfriend loved the hanger steak. The octopus could have been a little more tender but it was quite tasty. The baked truffle ricotta was delicious especially with the bread. I wasn't too impressed with the meat and cheese board. It had duck, prosciutto, and mortadella. The duck was an acquired taste and we both didn't prefer it. I found it odd that mortadella was served on the board since its such a simple cold cut, nothing special. Prosciutto is common as well. Parmesan cheese slices were included which was just okay.   I will say that I'm impressed that they granted our seating request for a nice booth. The back waiter was kind of in a hurry to wrap our food and kept asking if we were still working on our plates every few minutes so we felt rushed. Server was nice but our waters were never even filled once. Food was great but service was average hence the 4 stars. Be prepared to spend quite a bit here. Our bill almost neared $160 before gratuity.",

    "text": "Where are all my young people at? They're all at Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar! Not one employee looked a day over 30 and the diners were pretty youthful themselves. I felt young and hip just eating at this Red Rock Casino restaurant.   I made reservations using OpenTable after reading about long wait times from other Yelpers. I made a 7:30PM reservation for two, but I think it might have been unnecessary. Upon arriving 10 minutes early, I informed the hostess I had a reservation. She seemed confused and didn't seem to actually look up reservation requests, but proceeded to seat us right away anyways. It was a Monday night, so that might explain things.   We were handed at least 4 different menus. Craziness! We already knew what we wanted after looking up the menu online - I was getting the Tomato Bisque and my husband was ordering the rotisserie chicken.   SERVICE: The hostess was an absolute doll. She was super nice and even draped a napkin across my lap! The various staff who filled up our beverages did a decent job. What really killed our experience at Hearthstone, however, was our waitress with some kind of mermaid name - Lorelai. She took FOREVER to take our order and pretty much avoided us the entire time we were there. My husband wanted to order a glass of wine but decided not to because it would take too long. Waitress Fail!    ROTISSERIE CHICKEN ($21): This is a baby-sized rotisserie chicken. My husband said it was good but not enough food. The chicken came with a small salad which he didn't care for. The \"dressing\" didn't taste like anything. Be careful of the teeny red jalapeno slices. I ate half a slither and just about burned my face off.  TOMATO BISQUE ($10): Mimi's Cafe has better tomato soup. Plus, it was lukewarm. The grilled cheese served with the soup had annoyingly super crusty bread.   AMBIANCE: I loved the decor and feel of the restaurant. It's open and spacious, and I think I saw shuffleboard over by the bar/lounge area!   PRICE: I didn't even order an entree and the tab came to just shy of $38, not including tip. They charge $4 for a Pepsi. WTF? To top it off, we were both still hungry upon leaving Hearthstone. I don't get the whole \"You're supposed to share these plates\" concept. For that price, I better be stuffed at my meal's end!  Return Visit?  No thanks, I'll pass. The waitress sucked big time. The food is mediocre, overpriced, and the portions are for infants.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #21  *THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW!!*",

I ordered the burger & fries, my boyfriend got the pasta & of course I liked his dish more than mine. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium & the texture wasn't burnt but the flavor was burnt. Enjoyed the fries & my boyfriends dish. Can't remember which pasta exactly but it was so good & a nice size portion. Overpriced as most of the other reviews state - we thought about some appetizers but decided drinks instead (one or the other so we didn't have $100+ bill for a random night out for dinner). Not shocked about the prices, expected from a casino restaurant. I'll be back & would recommend.",

It's a place to take your friends and family. The best part is they have live music every 8pm and you can even dance. There's an elegant seating area by the performers where you can have a relaxing time sipping your wine while enjoying the live music. I highly recommend this place. It's worth it!",

She quickly caught on to our sarcastic nature and really added a great element to our time spent here. We had some drinks, including the special mule made with whiskey, which was spot on. In addition, we had some appetizers, and it was more than enough to satisfy our cravings. The ricotta spread was savory and had a nice crunch factor with the toast, and you can't go wrong with sweet potato fries and the surprise kick of the harissa yogurt. Overall a great experience and we will certainly return.",

However, I will say that our server last night was very attentive, and our food was brought out really quickly without compromising on quality.   We went for the Wednesday $1 oyster special, and were also there during happy hour, so were able to take advantage of both. The oysters were extremely fresh, perfectly chilled, and we didn't receive any of the overly large ones that can at times be unappetizing. We started out with two glasses of wine, a dozen oysters, 2 orders of the steak tartar bites ($6 each during happy hr), and an order of hummus that was complimentary with a yelp check-in. Everything was perfect. We opted to sit on the patio since the weather was as perfect as it could possibly be, and ended up deciding to get another 2 glasses of wine, with an additional dozen oysters.   As I mentioned, I've been here quite a few times before, and none of the food has ever been bad. Sometimes the service is lacking, and occasionally the food is 'good, not great', but as for last night, the experience was a perfect 10 all around.   I will most definitely be returning for the oyster special, as it really can't be beat for the price and quality.",

I came despite the fact that the item I saw on food porn could only be ordered for a few hours on Sunday during brunch and I was coming for dinner... still I came! Well, you walk in to the place and honestly it is stunning. The design is clever, using reclaimed, repurposed everything. Super chic. Old, dimly lit industrial lighting is everywhere. As far as design goes, it doesn't get any better. We started at the bar, ordered a Big Tom's Sour. What I received was watery fruit juice with hardly any rum. One of the worst drinks I've had in quite some time. Bad tasting and no feeling whatsoever on the brain. Avoid the Latin bartender with the red Henley.  At the table we ordered this stuff: Deviled eggs - how do they make such mini deviled eggs and why are they so bland? Tasted like yellow cream. Burger with an added egg - adequate but missing every flavor you want. Shrimp Pasta - this was good! Green beans - another hit! Fries - the worst type in the world.. steak fries. Triple frying helped a little. Peanut Butter Lava Cake - the cake was not good, the filling better. Butterscotch pudding - lacking a key ingredient... Butterscotch! Super meh Seems like this place is on it's way out, like the chef has moved on or is working on something else... like the restaurant is not a priority. Manager no longer responds to reviews here. Sad because this place could have been great.",

    "text": "Located at the Red Rock Hotel and Casino which is probably about 15-20min away from the strip, Hearthstone Kitchen and Cellar is an excellent option to dine, in a very relaxed chilled out rustic atmosphere eatery. Added plus, either before or after dinner, the casino is right there if you want to try your hand at luck, though you may want to opt for the after dinner gambling foray to make sure you can pay for dinner, ha! Certainly glad I did, haha! Made reservations for 7pm and we opted to eat in their outdoor seating area because the weather outside was so awesome (yes, i know, Summer in Vegas where temps hover in the 100's) but it was a warm 85 with nice breeze, which made it ideal. Plus they sat us next to flowing water fountain, which I think part of the cool breeze came from. The menu is plentiful with multiple options to fit everyone's taste which I believe 90% of the dishes are wood roasted in two oversize hearth ovens, hence the name. We had three vegetarians in our party, and everyone was pleased with the selections to choose from. I opted for the Hangar Steak and Wood Roasted Octopus as an appetizer and both were cooked to perfection and delicious! Others opted for various selections of pizza and asparagus and roasted garlic mash potatoes (which seem to be the only dish that didn't wow) but with a great selection of wines to choose, awesome service and reasonable prices, everyone was extremely pleased. This was my first time in Vegas visiting family and friends, and I will definitely be back and Hearthstone Kitchen and Cellar is definitely worth a repeat visit!",

I'm about great service and quality food and our main courses were not impressive at all. I order a chicken pot pie but their veloute was poorly made, the flavors were not there. The veloute was more of a runny soup than the thick stock it should be. Scallops were great and the tuna tartar was delicious, it was flavorful and decent portioned for an appetizer. Major work of improvement is attention to all tables not just certain tables!",

    "text": "I came here for the happy hour. I got there and had a complimentary glass of wine with my yelp checkin. The wine was quite good too. The bartender was very friendly and took very good care of me.    I ordered the tartare and wings because she recommended them. I also got the pepperoni pizza and parm meatball slider.   Very glad that I ordered the tartare. Very good recommendation. Wasn't sure how pickled veggies would taste in tartare but it was pretty good. I'd order it again.   The pepperoni pizza had a little bit of a spicy kick to it but nothing I couldn't handle and the crust was very good. Tasted like it had been made in a brick oven. No soggy parts on it even the middle was nice and crispy. I would have liked for it to have a little more cheese on it but nonetheless very tasty. I'll be getting that again.   The tartare and pizza came out first and I ate it. After finishing the pizza and tartare I Waited about five minutes before the wings got there that I had ordered at the same time. The bartender had to go and check on what was taking them so long. Eventually they got there. I had ordered them because of the bartenders recommendation. She said they were \"falling off the bone,\" but I would say that's a very bad description of them. They weren't falling off the bone by any means. They were tasty though. Paired nicely with the blue cheese dressing. They were 6 one sized bite each of \"wings\". I honestly don't think they were wings but rather maybe thighs. The bone did stick out nicely from the meat making them quite easy to eat. But it took a little bit of effort to tear them apart from the bone. They came with a slice of carrot and celery and some purple thing. I'm thinking it maybe was a purple carrot. They were very good but not falling off the bone and honestly don't know what took it so long to get to my seat. Would have rather had it with the rest of my food.  After finishing the tartare, pizza, and wings I was still feeling a bit hungry. So I ordered the parm meatball slider. But after having the first bite of it I wished I hadn't. The meat in the meatball had NO flavor. I don't even think they added salt to it. I could have gotten packaged meat at the supermarket and rolled it into a ball and that might have had more flavor than this sandwich. Why didn't they add any Italian seasoning to it I'll never know. Honestly the meatball sandwich at subway is a lot better than this sad to say. The fries that came with it were good. Very thin, crispy, and very lightly salted. Maybe even too lightly salted for some people's taste but for me it worked.   I saw that there is a Thursday night wine tasting with appetizers so I'm going to come tomorrow and check that out. Made a reservation for two for that. Maybe try a few more things on hh.   I've lived here a year and a half and have always walked by this restaurant when at Red rock and had never yet tried it til now. Glad I did. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of how long the wings took to get to me and the tasteless meatball slider. I'm willing to overlook that though and give it another try tomorrow night. Hopefully the wine tasting will make up for it.  *******Update *****  Went to the wine tasting on Thursdays. Had a reservation made for the lounge. The night I went there just happened to have a group in the lounge area so they moved the wine tasting to the back of the restaurant near the casino side. I checked in with the lady at the door on the casino side entrance and gave her my email address and she gave me two tickets for each person on the reservation. Each ticket was good for a wine tasting. I would say they poured about 2 ounces worth  in each glass. Not quite a full drink but after two tickets and my free wine with yelp checkin I was feeling good. A waitress and  waiter made rounds to each of the tables in the wine tasting area and allowed us to try different hors d'oeuvres. Some of the things that I sampled were the hummus which had chunks of chickpeas in it, the pepperoni pizza, the tartare, and I think something else too that I forget (thanks wine). They also brought out bread to the table. We were able to order appetizers from the happy hour menu even while being seated at a table. That was really nice. We ordered a couple of the burger sliders, the pigs in a blanket, the lamb pizza, and the pepperoni pizza.  The lamb pizza tasted really meaty. The meat was a little bit overpowering imo. I would have liked less meat and more cheese on it. The burger sliders were just ok and the fries that come with the burger I do like. The pigs in the blanket had a very nice flakey roll for the blanket and the pigs part was mediocre. Would have been nice to have packed that little piggy with some bigger flavors. I had a very fun time there though. Don't know if it was because of the wine, my company, or the overall atmosphere and service but whatever it is I would recommend trying the place out on Thursday nights. Lots of fun.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I came here this evening, thought we would try something new and off the strip.  First of all, the atmosphere is very hipster/ NYC ish. Love it!  We got a charcuterie board with salami, pepperoni and pecorino cheese with stone ground mustard and truffle honey. I could have eaten the honey by itself with a straw but I didn't wanna be that weird person lol  The baked ricotta was hands down the best thing we tried. It came in a deep dish and was still warm from the oven. Again with truffle honey  Short Rib Meatballs were delicious and paired very well with the goat cheese underneath.  The DOC pizza was the only thing I didn't care for. It was  good, but lacking flavor. Crust was very thin and flimsy. Buffalo mozzarella needed some salt to set off the flavor. The pizza itself didn't have much sauce either. But I ate it because I love pizza and I refuse to send food back.  The Wagyu Short Rib Burger was delicious. Perfect portion and had a side of fries. Fries were GF free too!    Service was fantastic! Ryan A was our server, did a menu walk thru and gave recommendations. If you come in, sit in his section, he was very knowledgable !   At the end of our meal we decided that we would rather drive all the way up from deep henderson to eat here than deal with the hustle and bustle of the strip.  Amazing find!",

    "text": "Went here for their Restaurant Week menu. It was my first time dining at Hearthstone.  It's such a cute place. Loved the decor and airiness of it. Now the important stuff.  Food & cocktails. The BlackBerry Bliss mule was refreshing and delicious.  A must try is the lobster roll. Great app for the table. IMO. From the RW menu I got the cheese plate,  flat iron steak and the nutella pizza.  The cheese plate was my least favorite item. They used slices of parm for the cheese. It overtook the prosciutto and bread. The flat iron steak was cooked perfectly & flavorful. The nutella pizza was nothing special. I'd definitely go again and try something different from the regular menu.",

Caitlin was our server and was phenomenal. . Great knowledge of the menu with a smile on her face the whole time. Very attentive and on her game. Sarah the manager was very hands on and as I watched her go to every single table to assure everyone's comfort. You can tell she has a good hold of her staff and her knowledge of how to run the front of the house is second to none. The food was fantastic. The Chick Pea salad was amazing along with the Wood Oven Pepperoni pizza. I recommend this place to everyone... A++",

Love the atmosphere of this place and I love that they have live music on Saturday's now! Food is great and they have happy hours, sometimes reversed happy hours. Their seared lamb was really good, and the D.O.C pizza is something I always order when I go. The GM was present the last time we went but he makes sure your food is good and that everything is ok, so it sort of has a professional yet laid back feel in the restaurant. Overall, I always take my friends here if they haven't tried it because I like it that much!",

    "text": "First visit and we're hooked!  It doesn't seem Hearthstone has been open all that long, but it's been long enough that it's a shame we haven't gone before.  Located right in Red Rock Casino, and right in the front of the building, it's easy to find.  A great menu and good prices.  Lots of indoor seating, and a generous section of scenic outdoor seating where you're surrounded by fountains and nice views of the mountains on the west side of town.  It's definitely a casual place (advertised as \"rustic\"), but if you're in a job requiring business clothes and you're headed there after work, you won't feel like you're overdressed.  There's no need to head home to change first.  To kick off dinner, we shared an order of Crispy Calamari.  It was just the right amount to prep us for dinner (most places serve you too much) and it wasn't really crispy--it's just a nicer way to say it's fried.  Don't panic though:  it was lightly breaded, lightly fried, and very tender.  I followed the appetizer with the Prime Flat Iron Steak (ordered medium rare and cooked perfectly) and my wife had the Prime Rib French Dip.  Both were amazing and as with the Calamari, the portions were just right.  We had room for dessert if we'd been in the mood for it, which is nice.  Next time we go back we'll try some other dishes and probably see what's happening on the dessert menu.  There are lots of regular and high-top tables, with seating and full service available in the bar area too.  There are also sofas and chairs around low coffee-style tables making this a great place to come for casual snacks and drinks, and creating a vibe that is almost like sitting at home.  As we were getting ready to leave there was a guitarist setting up to play in the area between the bar and where the couches were, adding live music to an already cool place.  They feature live music on Friday and Saturday evenings:  something we'll definitely go back to check out.  Annie was our waitress, and she was outstanding!  I rarely mention wait staff by name, but I wanted to mention her.  She treated us so well we felt like family or close friends.  We'll definitely ask to sit in her section again!  One note:  even though it didn't appear busy when we arrived, all the regular tables were full and there was clearly a list of reservations.  Go ahead and make one if you're headed there during typically busy restaurant hours or on those nights when folks like to go out (Friday and Saturday for sure).  When we went (on a Friday evening), there was only seating available in the bar area without a wait.  Not a big deal though, the seating and service in the bar area was just as nice as the rest of the restaurant, and frankly, if you're there for casual conversation with friends and want to be near the music, the bar is probably the best place to be.  And it was never too loud to carry on a nice conversation.  We're going back soon.  Hearthstone is definitely on our list of new favorites in Summerlin!",

We just loved the atmosphere too , live music is always a plus and sooo hard to find good live music around vegas that's off the strip !

I want to say it reminds me of a rustic southern countryside feel. We enjoyed our dinning experience outside on their patio area. Very spacious, lot of seating arrangements as well as a bar. It's a great place to catch a bite or to grab drinks after a long day.   Baked Truffle Ricotta (Truffle Honey+Black Pepper+Gouda): This was excellent! I love anything truffle & ricotta, so I really enjoyed this appetizer. Pigs-in-a-Blanket (Ketchup+Mustard): Traditional snack, didn't find it extraordinaire. Blackberry Bliss (Grey Goose Vodka+Blackberry Shrub+Lime+Mint+Ginger beer): This cocktail was yummy! Great combination of flavors, almost like a blackberry-mule  Happy Hour is from 5pm-7pm & Reverse Happy Hour from 6pm to 11pm All items on happy hour menu is $6 +including draft beers & house wines. * Don't forget to check-in on Yelp to redeem a free glass of wine offer.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and I like the ambiance and decor, especially the patio, but I'm not consistently wowed by the food or service, which should arguably be the highlights of a restaurant. One networking event had passed apps that focused on bar food like flatbread pizzas, wings, and deviled eggs. They were fine but not memorable. I attended a wine tasting that included access to a Whole Beast Feast (wood fire roasted pig!), which was cool to see and tasty to eat. Returned for HH with a friend and enjoyed the subtle sweetness of the Ricotta toast but loved the tartare bites! Wish we'd ordered a second round of those rather than the unremarkable chickpea chopped salad, which had maybe three chickpeas in it altogether and arrived nearly a half hour after our other dishes.   The service is what prevents me from rounding this up. At events, servers came across as disinterested and aloof. Most recently, we passed five employees on our trip through the empty restaurant to sit at the bar and not a single one said a word to us. Jocelyn helped us with our order and she was friendly. Then as we left, an employee walked out from the raw bar area, literally crashed right into us, and kept right on walking. It was downright bizarre.  They're currently running a half-off pizza special on Sunday evenings. Maybe I'll try that? I'm confused about why they're emphasizing their pizzas and bar food but going for an upscale vibe, it's uninspired and doesn't really work.",

I make my own truffle honey at home. I buy ricotta and fancy crusty bread. But it isn't the same. I keep thinking: what can I do without? Should I stop paying utilities? How can I save in gas? Do I really *need* other food? Or should I just eat one of the ricotta things a day? And unfortunately, reason normally takes over.  If you're with a group and have the budget, it's fun to get the charcuterie, the truffle ricotta, maybe split a pizza and some bacon brussel sprouts - it'll be $60+drinks, but also, it's fun, the ambiance is nice, and you'll be dreaming about it for the next year.",

Noticed the poster out front about $1 Oysters on Wednesdays and waited around for a few more hours just for that. So glad we did! The ambience was great, love the decor, oysters were great, small and freshly shucked (Kumis today), unlike most places that give you the extra large yucky tasty ones that the staff can't tell you what kind they are. Our server, Ahmed was attentive and awesome! Wish this place was here when we lived here. We'll be back when we're back in town. Thank you!",

Now for the restaurant in general it has a great view in and out it has it's own look. It has a great timing service hosts and waiters are fantastic at there customer service and getting the food orders right. The place is Friendly great for dates with your significant other or big family.",

My girlfriends and I came here for Sunday brunch which by the time we came, around one, the rush had basically died down. Once seated we weren't approached by our waitress until about 10 minutes later. Throughout the entire meal she was very inattentive. It wasn't just our waitress though our runner also seemed pretty awful. He first brought our food to the wrong table and then to us. Even as he was setting everything down he seemed very uneasy and shaky. It seemed like this was the first week they had ever worked in a restaurant.  Food wise it was pretty good. I had the croquet Madame sandwich which came with a fried egg and gravy type sauce on the top, very good! Also you can't beat bottomless mimosas for $15.   If only this place could train up their staff it'd be a huge successful. The ambulance and location are great!",

If you're a big fan of oysters or seafood in general, Wednesday's are a great night to indulge on the little sea pearls! They have $1 oyster specials the entire evening and specials throughout the week to suit your needs be it half price wine on Mondays or their happy hr through the weekday. The real reason to come is for the service. The entire staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. I've had several great encounters with Jocelyn who is such a boss behind the bo! Hard not to want to sit up up there with a great view of the tv and feel like you're VIP!   Update 2/07/2018 THEY HAVE WINE ON TAP, YA'LL! $6 for happy hour Mon-Fri 5pm-7pm. That alone should prompt you to get in your car and drive over directly for work stress relieve if anything.",

    "text": "Came in on a Weds night and it was hoppin so the fella and I found a cozy spot in the bar area while waiting for a booth to open up. The hostess was so attentive and kept checking in with us and updating us on their status. Loved that! Once we got our booth, I looked up to see their specials of the evening and was soooo so excited to have the Florida stone crab & clam chowder in a bread bowl!!! Unfortunately, we were sat at 6:30 pm and told the specials ran out \"10 minutes ago\" bummer. Major bummer, but the lesson here is MAKE A RES. and get your orders in for specials, early!  So, moving on to the meal, I had a hard time deciding on anything once the specials fell through, since I had a taste for clam chowder and crab now, but I really enjoyed my glass of Educated Guess Cab, and was sooo excited they had it on their wine list. +1 for that! Eventually the fella and I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, beet salad and a meatball flat bread. The dates texture was off for me - the bacon wasn't crisped, and soggy bacon fat was not pleasant. The flavor was awesome though- good garlic, tomato and smokey flavor from bacon. Lesson here, order them extra crispy, maybe?? Could be a really yummy dish when crisped up.  I moved on to the beet salad and had my MIND BLOWN, so completely that I didn't even care about the dates anymore, and was only slightly sad about the crab and chowder :). Seriously though, if you are a fan of the beet/goat cheese relationship, you must must order this salad!  The flat bread was also delicious, but the salad had all of my attention. We also enjoyed really great and fun service. Our server didn't rush us as we sat for a loooong time drinking wine and mulling over the menu trying to decide. She was so patient, all smiles and offered us plenty of suggestions. The hostess checking in with is while we waited for a booth in the beginning also sticks out for me as GREAT hospitality, and you definitely won me over in hospitality.",

You have to wait for the server to bring them, and if they are busy, you can sometimes end up waiting up to 5 minutes just to get a menu. This has happened to us on so many occasions, and it's super annoying. Its sooooo much easier to have a menu to look at while your waiting for your server to greet you, and be able to order right away,  instead of wasting 5-10 minutes. Hopefully they will change this practice",

But we either have 5 different people serving us, or we have a server that is not attentive at all. As much as they charge for their food, you'd think they'd have better service.  The last time, we were sat at a table that had no menus, dinnerware, silverware or glasses. It took about 10-15 minutes after asking to get some. After the actual server came around, it took him 10 minutes to get us water and over 30 minutes just to get our drinks. It took 4 of us 2 hours just to have dinner because he was seriously slacking. Quite frustrating.  Also, it was not that busy. There were larger parties around us that were in after us a left before us. I'm very observant.   The food here is good. But for me, it's not worth flagging your waiter down just to order things.  The only cool thing is they have some local artists play chill music on the weekends. If it's not that, their DJ plays...but it's loud af.   If you want good food in this casino, Lucille's and Yard House are your best two $$ price range options. The food is always pretty good and the service is almost always on point.",

The decor was really nice! It was a mix of big screens for games and updated charming seating a decorator would appreciate. I really thought it was nicely done and way better than I expected.

    "text": "My friend and I went to a brunch event that they advertised and hosted a couple of months ago. It was called \"kegs and eggs.\"  It had to be one of the worst planned events I have ever attended. Well, maybe that's being a little bit dramatic....This event was advertised for MONTHS. We made reservations via Open Table and closer to the date, we tried to call for information. Neither the hostess or Manager were able to provide any, all the way up until the DAY BEFORE. Perhaps that should've been a warning.  They kept telling us that they were \"putting the final touches on the menu,\" however the actual menu was not any different than what they normally offer for brunch. The only addition was the Nate from Bad Beat had a table set up in the back of the restaurant, where he was giving out samples of beer. That's awesome, but I live 5 minutes from the brewery and didn't need to drive all the way to Summerlin for that.  There seemed to be A LOT of miscommunication. When we arrived to check in for our table, they tried to seat us on the patio. It was hotter than hell and there wasn't a single other person out there. Um, no thank you, we'll take a table inside. They didn't have a table inside and ended up sitting us at the end of one of their high-top large tables. It was really weird.  The service overall was really lacking. Our server was painfully slow and when it was time to cash out, he kept our change as a tip without asking.  I wasn't overall impressed with the food either. I ordered the California Bennie. I think the menu should be more specific and mention that there is NO bread as part of this dish. Instead of brioche or an english muffin, the bottom half is a large slice of tomato. I was expecting there to be bread, topped with a small slice of tomato and everything else. It was really not great.   Anyhow, the decor is really cute and it's bright and open and cheery. Unfortunately, it just came off to me like a place where hipster-ish people were going to be \"seen,\" rather than a place that stands on it's food and service.",

Both times, they have been understaffed and as a result you're left waiting for the menus to be delivered, waiting to order, waiting excessively for basic necessities like small plates, table clearing, your food and your check. Also the ambiance was cool until the music stopped for a good 10 minutes, which shows that restaurant doesn't even care enough to either have pandora going or set a long enough playlist.   The food is good but it had been sitting a while so it came out Luke warm which typically you wouldn't notice but the hollaindaise on the eggs benny started to harden which really isn't appealing. It would also help if the seafood bar chefs were trained well on how to shuck oysters as the oysters had so much shell in it, it was hard to enjoy... not to mention it would have been nice to know what oysters were plated.  It really comes down to management. If management can get their stuff together, this place could really be an awesome dining experience. Instead we waited a while for the menus, then the oysters came out with shells in them and we also weren't explained the type/ order they came in (this is pretty standard for a place that boasts an oyster bar), waiting a long while until we received our mains that had obviously been sitting out waiting to be served, waited 20 minutes for our check until we decided to get up and request it from the hostess, and suggested that we speak to the manager only to be told that there's only one around and kind of ignored the request we had.  To be honest, I don't know if i'll be returning after having been disappointed a second time. It truly is a shame though bc the food is actually quite tasty despite having been sitting out.",

Being a local these prices were just to much :(  113$ for 2 people with 2 appetizer's, 2 beers and 1 entree was just ridiculous. Not to mention if you get the steak tartare and want the poached egg they up sell you 2$ and if you want extra toast to go with it, it's an extra 2$ boo!",

Loved eating lots of appetizers instead of one large meal.  Seems like there are several good choices for anyone (veggie, seafood, meat, etc.).  Drinks were great!",

We began with the organic vegetables which we shared. The waitress couldn't tell us accurately what all the different veggies were in this wonderfully presented dish but we ate all of them. The dip was zesty (if you like miracle whip) but there was not enough of if. We moved on and ordered the baked ricotta, roasted squash, grilled broccoli & the chick pea salad. I know it sounds like a lot of food but we took our time and the portions are very moderate so it was not over the top. Everything they served was well presented and very yummy, expecially the baked ricotta with the truffle honey. We hadto ask for more bread!! Service was very good and attentive. I strongly suggest reservations as it gets pretty busy.",

Not only was Shane so great to us but I noticed how he went from table to table making sure everyone was enjoying their food and service. Our waiters were also wonderful! And the food...SO good. Love that it comes in sharing sizes. Very reasonably priced as well. I could see Hearthstone becoming one of my go to spots. Five stars from me.",

She took our order and then we never saw her again.  We had to flag a busboy down on 3 separate occasions to get some bread, some salad dressing, and get the waitress so we could get our check.  The food was just OK.  The hash browns were not good but the roasted potatoes were good.  The salad was a salad.  The California Benedict eggs were bland and the 'chicken' tasted like packaged lunch meat.  We were there for an hour and a half.  You would think in 90 minutes the waitress could have at least stopped to see how we were doing, but nope.  This is the 3rd time I have given this place a chance.  and each time the service has gotten worse and worse and the price is not cheap.  And do not go for the oysters, they are notoriously TINY.  We had 2 shells with nothing in it???  Maybe the shucker was hungry too?  Goodbye hearthstone.",

    "text": "Unbelievable...the first time we came here we had a horrible experience where we had someone name drop the owner of the casinos to get in on their reservation on time when we had been waiting for ours for 35 minutes. After my yelp review I was contacted and comped a meal which I really appreciated. We have since come back and had no issues until today when I talked this restaurant up to our closest friends only to have a waitress who doesn't come to the table, won't stay for more than a second, didn't ask how our food was, and what's going on with every person who works here not knowing anything about the menu? I gave this place a second chance and clearly there is a lack of direction, training, passion or even an ounce of consideration for the customer. You're in Summerlin which is probably on par with the strip on what you expect when you drop $200-$400 on a meal. There shouldn't be any issues when you're paying  $16 for an omelette that comes out bland and boring. I'm embarrassed that we brought them here to this. We won't be coming back off of shear principle. Things need to be fixed or this will be the next restaurant to turnover quickly. With restaurants like Andiron less than a mile a way you can't operate how you are.",

The overall vibe of the place is great for an early evening sunset dinner with huge windows that let tons of light in, or a great date spot where you can dine on the patio in the warm, summer air underneath beautiful tea lights. The charcuterie is great with a glass of wine. The bartender Jocelyn was very sweet and super attentive whenever we were in need of a refill and our server Johann's table side manner was genuine and quick. He anticipated our needs and we had a great time. Definitely making Hearthstone one of my regular spots.",

This place was truly the WORST restaurant I've ever been to in my life. The service and SERVER made the experience truly memorable and NOT in a good way. My husband and I sat in the patio area on a Monday night at 9pm. The place was nowhere busy whatsoever. The server didn't even greet us until 15 minutes later. Bad sign already. She came to take our order 10 minutes later with a huge attitude. She refused to even look me in the eye, then when I ordered a glass of Torrentes she snapped at me saying they didn't have it by the glass or even serve it there. I pointed to it on the menu and she rolld her eyes at me then said, \"fine.\"  Another BAD sign. My husband ordered a glass of wine as well and 2 appetizers. We decided to just enjoy ourselves and wait for our wine. Problem was, the vapid server NEVER CAME BACK. Nobody came to check on us or anything. Yet oddly enough, other patio tables that got seated after us were getting impecable service from this minles server and drinks and appetizers. At this point my husband and I had it. Finally a food runner comes over with our grilled artichoke and truffled popcorn. uuumm.... no drinks still!!!! WE ask him what's going on and he looks at us not understanding. He said he had no idea we had drinks and hed go check. 3 other people come back to our table with NO WINE but refill our waters. I felt as if we were on the show, WHAT WOULD YOU DO. Only that show always seems to inform people they are on a show and try to make ammends for their actions. We have had at this point and ask for the manager AGAIN!!!  Surprisingly the elusive server comes by and asks what the problem is. We tell her we how is it possible that our appetizers which took 20 mins to make, came out before our wines? She once again, ever so pleasantly rolls her eys and storms off. My husband gets up to look for a manager. 10 minutes later and 3 MORE servers later a manger finally emerges. WE break down everything that has happened to us and ask her what the server has against us specifially since she only seems to be serving all the other tables but us. The manager says, well she's young. REALLY?! That's the excuse you give for repulsive service and night? There is no excuse for her actions towards us. The manager sent over a couple of items on the house and that seemed to be that with them. Words cannot describe the amateur back alley 3 ring circus of a night we had at this restuarant. We definitely will not be going back to be treated like circus folk again.",

Tried the meatball appetizer which was $16 for three tiny balls in very average red sauce. We asked for some bread which was nice but we're surprised when the bill came that it cost $8!  Hubby had pasta that was supposed to have short ribs in it but could barely find the meat. I had scallop special on shrimp risotto which was about a \"B\" but for $42 could have had some hint of seasoning. Very average food for $130. Oh yeah, $8 for bottle of beer.

We sat down, and a bus person came and asked if we wanted water, and we said regular water would be fine.  He walked by our table approximately 3 times in 10 mins, and never brought water, finally i stopped him and asked him about our waters, yeah, he forgot.  Nobody came to our table offering a menu, so I went to the hostess and said we had been there 15 mins, and have not even received a menu.  She promptly gave us menus, but nobody explained anything, and she said she would send over the manager.  The manager start walking over to us, but we noticed it was a terrible service manager, Peter from Vintner Grill, who was awful....to the point that after so many years of being regular customers, we stopped going there.  When he saw who we were, he stopped near our table, turned around to look at us and walked away.  He never did come to our table to apologize for the terrible service.  The table behind us got seated, and within a minute, had water, a table server and menus.  Our serve was very nice, and did bring us dessert on the house, even though we told her not to bother.  Its seems that when the other manager was there, from what my friends told me, the place was much better.  I remember when you had to wait at least 1 hour for a table on a Saturday night.  We walked right in, as so did many others after us without a wait, and there were several empty table, and this was approximately 7 pm.",

The Waitress that handled our experience was super knowledgeable and made us feel special through the meal, We never wanted for anything.  Dessert time!!!  We declined the menus as we couldn't fit another bite.  However our server mentioned the chocolate cake is \"to die for\"  and if we didn't like it she would remove it from our bill.  OK  we loved it and took some home for later that night.   Octopus Meatballs Watermelon Salad Burger Salmon Shrimp Pasta Chocolate Cake  all Winners and must have's, can't wait to come back.

I was in this past weekend for the 2nd time and yes I will agree that some of the food is overpriced, but my wife and I enjoy the environment and have had great service BOTH times. I think the food sometimes does take a bit long but the place is huge and I'm not in any hurry otherwise I'd go to the food court lol. I cant remember who served us the first time but Ryan took care of us last, he was amazing and we basically went with most of his suggestions, we had:  Stuffed Dates which were so good Quinoa Salad was delicious  A few other things and then we had the special NY steak that was on their board. He told us we would love it and he was right!   Everything we've had has been pretty great, a few things weren't my favorite but hey thats at ANY restaurant. Oh and definitely try the Lava Cake! Best part of the meal!! A manager even came by at some point to check on us, so I dont know what some of these people are talking about. Bussers and everyone was great.

Ending the meal with wine and the honey oil cake with blood orange sherbet and the peanut butter Lava cake. Both drool worthy.   However the service was mediocre at best.  My friends that have been several times before stated its always bad.  She came to the table and would ask if we have questions and mid sentence of our reply would haul ass away. Never refilled water. We had to ask repeatedly for her to clean up the old dishes.  She brought all drinks in front of me and told me to pass them around which isn't a huge deal if she was cooler but she was pretty much just bossing us around. Definitely recommend management to be more engaged bc if someone would have come by I'd have said something. I would have asked her for the manager but we could barely order without lassoing her in.  I'd go again but I'll move if we get her again.",

If you want some of the best pizza in Vegas order any of them on the menu. This time my friend had the truffle chicken, smelled great. I had the burger w/ bacon, nice thick patty with skinny fries. Ended with my fav peanut butter lava cake... wowwww. Thank you Hstone!!",

    "text": "This is my 2nd trip to Hearthstone. The first time the dysfunction at the hostess stand was way too much to endure so I left and had a hot dog by the sports book.  The dysfunction sadly still remains.  The restaurant wasn't full; plenty of tables, but even with a reservation we waited for 10 minutes. I have to say training the front of the house staff can be beneficial.  We were assigned two servers; kind of odd, but okay.  The appetizer or small plate of jalapeno hummus was good; not too hot.  Our dinners; the rotisserie chicken and DOC Flatbread were average at best. The rotisserie potatoes were delicious.  Our dessert was the apple tart. It was very good.  Tye servers are trying very hard, which is always appreciated. The noise level is deafening, couldn't hear anything our server suggested.  We will give them another chance down the road, but with the many new choices at downtown summerlin it may be a while.",

But it's also a bummer because things that we went back for were gone. Our waiter was awesome... the 1st two times there, that was not the case. These past two times, though,  zero complaints! The calamari was still spot-on but with more deep fried lemons & zucchini & I'm pretty sure the portion was a bit larger (yay!). I tried 2 new items for my entree: French onion soup & adult grilled cheese. My g*d, the soup was incredible. Perfect balance of sweet & savory. The cheese & crouton were easy to manage. The grilled cheese, however, lacked in a couple places: 1) no flavor whatsoever & 2) it was rather dry. It needed more cheese or a more creamy one. I wasn't blown away by the desserts either. Luckily the calamari & soup carried the meal & made it mostly worth it.",

    "text": "Went for dinner and oysters last night.  Without a doubt, this overrated place has the worst, most unprofessional service you can find. Sat at the seafood counter. There were several empty seats and the staff was not busy nor were they attentive to their jobs.  There were three waitresses/bartenders behind the counter.  They were very busy socializing with eachother and ignoring this customers waiting for service.  While the counter was not full, it took over ten minutes just to get the attention of the servers.  One finally came over just to tell us that she won't be serving us and she let me know that someone else will be coming by soon.  We ordered drinks, oysters and an appetizer.  They were served by someone who appeared mad that they were working there. Their hostility towards their job was obvious.  Our intention was to have diner there but after fininshing what we ordered, we were completly ignored by the incompetent, unprofessional, untrained and unsupervised help. We were not even asked if we wanted a second drink.  Everyone knows that the margins on drinks can make or break the bottom line for any restaurant.  After another fifteen minutes, a rude servered cleared the area, never asking if we wanted to order anything else.  At that point I was disgusted with the horrible service, presented my credit card and was expected to pay the bill, without even being presented with the check to review. I had to ask the server to see the check prior to paying the bill.  Really? The management here better wake up before it's time to close the doors.  If service remains as-is, it's just a matter of time.",

    "text": "Amazing!... At how a little service and go a long way at any establishment. Hearthstone is a pleasantly comfortable restaurant slash bar on the northern side of red rock casino. But don't be fooled, despite the warm entrance, lies a horrid truth. A dissatisfied empty stomach! Every meal on the list was completely overpriced but even that isn't what motivate such a low 2 star rating from me. Not only was I ignored by 1, but by 2 servers. I came in with 2 others and we sat at our table and each ordered 1 order of their unlimited wings for national wing day. Our friend also ordered 1 steak fries recommended by our waiter to share, having been told us the steak fries were perfect to share between the 3 of us. Laughable. The fries $8, were made from 1 single potato, consisting of 7 pieces. I counted.. It wasn't enough to feed a squirrel.. But besides our misleading waiter, what annoyed me was his lack to keep with our order. I also asked if we could use the check in offer on yelp for a glass of wine.. One that never came! When our food finally came out, instead of individual plates, we were given 1 plate to share the wings. But it didn't even compensate by adding more wings to the plate, it was simply done to make their serving easier on them. And when we asked for 1 more sauce cup, it also was lost along with our Houdini server. So we then asked Criss Angel, the chef who also vanished along with our nonexistent extra sauce as well. I was amazing at their vanishing act but left distressed in the process. It took 3 hours to get 2 dishes of wings.. All you can eat in the course of 12 hours?  The only single redeeming quality in service wasn't even from our host, but the water boy. He filled our water cups and our drinks and even tried to fill in and do the service that our host lacked at one point for him. I think this kid should take over and the waiter be demoted.  **update in case there is a misunderstanding in this review. The wing day deal of 10$ per person was clear to us prior to coming here and we ordered it that way as well, there was no miscommunication on that. But what was disappointing was receiving 1 plate of wings for 3 separate unlimited wing orders. Instead of giving 3 individual plates to each of us, I mean, we did order separately, why are we all sharing on 1 plate for? If we all order steak dinner are we gonna be given 3 steaks on 1 plate or 3 plates with 1 steak? That's my issue. It created a shorter meal, longer wait time for our orders to come through, less sauce for our wings, and horrible service.",

    "text": "There are so many things I really like about Hearthstone. Unfortunately, the things I do not like cloud the experience there.  In spite of the major issue I have with Hearthstone, I will definitely come back.  It's the kind of place I want to work. And the issue is incredibly \"fixable.\"  The issue is the service. The employees are very kind and accommodating. My issue is not with the staff but with the system of service. Let me say this was my second meal at Hearthstone and the service during the first meal was abysmal. But the restaurant was new and I was looking forward to getting back to see what changes had been made. While their service has progressed by leaps and bounds, there are still some confusing missteps that keep this place from being an excellent venue.   It begins when you call. I called a few times the same day (for different reasons) and each time the phone was answered with an informal yet relatively friendly, \"Hello.\" I was taken aback each time and had to ask on the last call if I had even reached the business.  I don't know the last time I made a reservation and did not hear the name of the business.  It's an odd experience to have to say, \"Is this Hearthstone?\"  Then there were issues at the hostess stand. The hostess was friendly and sorted everything out, but there were very serious communication issues at the hostess stand during our first visit as well. This seems to be an area they need to tighten up. We arrived on time for our reservation and were content to wait at the hostess stand to be helped. While we were waiting for the hostess to return another couple stepped behind us. After a few minutes, the man behind us become frustrated and went to go find the hostess. When he returned with the hostess behind him, she apologized to him and his guest and was preparing to seat them without even acknowledging us. We had to tell her that we had been waiting longer and expected to be seated first. She apologized (this time to us) and seated us.   When we sat down we were promptly forgotten and had to ask a manager for menus. People seated some time after us were ordering food by the time we received a menu. Not a huge deal and the waiter was very kind. But it was another odd glitch in service that just doesn't serve this space well.   Once we made contact with our waiter, service was fantastic and we enjoyed our experience. The space has the earthy/industrial vibe that so many places have. But they marry it well with Italian country kitchen touches so that it feels less industrial and more warm. It feels good to be in there. And they get lots of light, so an early dinner means you will enjoy plenty of natural light even if you are not sitting on the patio.   The menu is simple/rustic and thoughtful. Lots of flatbreads, charcuterie, and small bites appetizers make for varied options when ordering. We tasted the meat and cheese board, deviled eggs, roasted broccoli, arugula salad, baked ricotta (OUTSTANDING), marinara flatbread, and popcorn. Everything was very tasty and well prepared. I love that they let the simple ingredients shine. Of all the dishes we enjoyed, only one (deviled eggs) did not reach its potential.  I like the tapas/small plates explosion because it allows people to try more dishes without having to commit to a large portion. The menu at Hearthstone is one of their strengths. It is simple and I love that the offerings all \"go together\". You can order a few of the small bites, a few appetizers, a flatbread, and a main course and feel a sort of cohesion to the food and ingredients.  Unlike some tapas places, the food items here are generally familiar. They take simple ingredients and prepare them thoughtfully with a small (and very safe) twist. For example, you have had ricotta cheese before, no doubt.  You may not have had ricotta with truffle honey and gouda on toast. Hearthstone offers this delectable dish I want to return for.  Overall: The food is simple, well prepared, rustic(ish), and most importantly, tasty.  If they weren't also attempting (like most restaurants) to offer an experience, I would ONLY judge them on the food. But they are and I can't. I have to look at the totality of my experience at Hearthstone and say that they have the potential to be a really great local restaurant. The service issues are \"small\" but consistent and frequent. And unfortunately those issues take away from my experiences with the appetizing food at Hearthstone.",

    "text": "Hearthstone is the restaurant in the station group that I visit the most. I've been here many times for dinner, and I like some of the items a lot. This location is also convenient to me. Hence, I kept coming back. As for brunch, I was only here once and I didn't like the options nor the entree I had.   The service was decent when I visited this week. It can be hit or miss.   On my recent visit, they changed the menu again and took out some of my favorites including steak tartare and FG&J(it just came back and it's gone again). The whole dining experience was disappointing with some of the new items. I will list them out in below.   1. Baked Ricotta (3/5): this dish no longer came with small jar of truffle money on the side, or they forgot? It did not taste the same with it. This is my must order dish each time, so I was highly disappointed. I guess I will need to ask for truffle honey on the side next time to see if it still tastes the same.   2. Tuna Tartare (1/5): it was sooo terrible. The fish wasn't that fresh. They might as well call this salty tuna. It was so salty that we couldn't psychically  eat it.   3. Brussel Sprouts (1/5): it was burnt and bitter. We had to send this back to the kitchen because it was not inedible. I never had crispy Brussels sprouts this bad.   4. Oysters (4/5): they are $1 each on wed, so not much complaints there for the quality of the oysters.   5. Apple and Quinoa Salad (3/5): it was decent. We added the chicken with it and the chicken was kinda of meh.   6. Lollipop Chicken Wings (4/5): this was one of the new items that I've tried and it was one of the few items that we liked this time.   7. Shrimp and Grits (3/5): I love shrimp and grits. I often order it when I see it on the menu. Shrimp was fresh and the sauce was yummy. However, the grits was not fully cooked and it was still touch and crunchy.   8. Wood Roasted Octopus (3/5): it was decent. Not the best nor the worst one I've had. It seemed lack in flavors compared to before. Also, there used to be two octopus arms, now just one?   9. Upside Down Pineapple Caked (5/5): it was the savior of our dinner. The cake was warm and soft. Not too sweet just the way we like it. I will order this again.   In all, the whole dining experience was terrible to try some of the new items on the menu, and even the existing  menu items were not the same. We asked the waitress to send back the Brussel sprouts. She didn't bother to ask other items so we didn't tell her about the salty tuna tartare nor the uncooked grits. I really want to be a repeat customers since I really liked the place at one point. I hope that they will reorganize the menu and fix the existing items on the menu.i",

It took a while to get water and drinks and also longer than usual to place our orders. All of us opted for the bottomless mimosas but I would not get them again. The orange juice was sour and there was too much pulp in the mix. The chicken and waffles I had was good, but I felt it was overpriced. Overall, an underwhelming experience for the money.",

The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was splendid.  We sat outside and enjoyed the sun while indulging in great eats!  I will be back...and that's a long drive from Chicago.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for Las Vegas Restaurant Week for the first time. This is somewhere we have both been wanting to try but wow were we disappointed! We spent over $100 on very mediocre food. To start we had the apple quinoa salad, which to our surprise, came out much smaller than the regular size and did not have chicken. We also had the calamari which was very tasty. The hanger steak was very small for the regular menu price of $33 and had zero flavor. Even the aioli served with it just tasted like mayo. I had the truffle pasta and while the portion was good and the flavor was decent, it had very small pieces of prosciutto and the sauce was the consistency of water. We were so bummed by the meal so far that we were really hoping the desserts would save the day!... they also failed miserably. Bread pudding is by far my favorite dessert and while this one definitely had a glazed donut flavor as advertised, it was very mushy and just tasted like a soggy donut. The pineapple upside down cake should be renamed dry lemon cake. Aside from the pineapple slice, there was no pineapple flavor. The white tsp serving on top is the vanilla ice cream... The 2 stars I gave were for the ambience (very nice retro farmhouse vibe) and the service because our server was very nice and attentive.",

The waiter told us we made good choices and that they were well known for their pizza.   We received the salad first it was just ok wouldn't eat the chicken it was not appetizing it looked like it was opened from a package and dumped on it.  They finally brought our pizza and believe you me I would not have ordered it, it tasted terrible and the Brussels sprouts were burnt and had absolutely no flavor.  I have been in town for over 47yrs and have eaten at the Red Rock many times, worst meal I have ever had there.  Don't have to worry about me spending money there again.  Had Blaze pizza the next night and it was better than the pizza at hearthstones.  The service lacked after we had our order taken as they had 2 big parties there so I understand that a table with 2 people don't count as much.",

Unfortunately the hummus was blah and they didn't offer any vegan/ vegetarian options for their taco plate so I had to spend a little more to eat. Overall other than the food disappointment the experience was nice and they kept my margarita filled for the full duration of my time there! I might consider going again but hope that they add a bean/potato/mushroom taco option for their taco Tuesday deal! I bet they would get more business!",

We were seated promptly. The place is a modern bar-staraunt with indoor and outdoor seating. The wine room was dark, but they turned the lights on brighter for us. It isnt FULLY private because parts of the ceiling is exposed so closing the doors still kept the volume outside louder than expected but it was still nice. Since it was Sunday at 2pm we were still in the brunch menu. I had the loco moco and WOW! It was so full of flavor, meat nice and tender and egg yolks perfectly melty. My father in law got the strawberry french toast and he said that was the best breakfast food he has ever had. The kids had pizza, which was eaten up. And my hubs got the french dip. He said the meat was well seasoned and the au jus was a nice addition. We will be back. And surprisingly, even on a busy day, the waitress was very kind and attentive. Cant wait to brunch here again.",

I had a martini and we ordered the lollipop chicken wings (incredible) and the brussel sprouts.  What most impressed me about this place was the service.  I run a hospitality company in California and we are considering a move to the area and this, by far, was the best dining experience we have had so far.  We had Shane as our waiter and he was INCREDIBLE!!!!  He was knowledgeable, courteous, friendly, and had some incredible suggestions and really helped to guide us through the menu.  He absolutely made the experience wonderful and had incredible situational awareness and EQ and was there when we needed him, but didn't hover.      I spoke with the general manager Russell later on and thanked him for the experience and you could tell through the conversation (and from what I could tell watching him around the restaurant) that he worked hard, and really cared about his team.  The restaurant was well laid out and the music was the perfect volume, quiet enough to allow us to talk, but loud enough to set the ambiance.  I will 100% be back as soon as I am back in town and especially as I move to town!  Thank you Hearthstone!",

I will update this review once I eat there again but they're already doing better than two stars.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Disappointed.   My sister and brother-in-law flew to Vegas for my birthday and stayed at Red Rock Casino and said that they'd like to take me dinner. I chose Hearthstone for dinner after walking through the casino and seeing shishito peppers on the menu, one of my favorites.  We had a reservation and were seated quickly, no complaints. We ordered two appetizers, the shishito peppers and baked truffle ricotta. We ordered salads to follow, my sister ordered the beet salad and my brother-in-law and I each ordered  an apple & quinoa salad. For our mains my sister ordered the zucchini ribbons pesto, my brother-in-law ordered short ribs and, on the servers recommendation, I ordered the hanger steak.  The server said we could order everything at once and they would stagger the courses, so we did. This is when the problems started.   Someone that we'd never seen brought the salads out before our appetizers. When we were halfway through the salads the baked truffle ricotta arrived, delicious but should have been served first. We expected the peppers (why I even chose the restaurant) to show up shortly, but didn't. We had to ask our server about them and it was clear that they were forgotten or overlooked, and they took at least another ten minutes to arrive, almost as the mains did. Our mains arrived but my hanger steak and shoestring fries, that were recommended, were room temperature at best. I only mentioned it when my sister asked how my steak was. I didn't want to complain about a meal she was treating me to for my birthday. She asked me if I wanted to send it back, but I didn't want it to seem like I didn't appreciate the meal, as both she and my brother-in-law's meals we're both seemed tasty and hot.   How do you thumb your nose at a gift?  The courses were not staggered or served in the right order, maybe if I'd received my steak first it would have been warm, who knows how long it was sitting there. It's hard to appreciate the appetizers when they are served after the salads as promised..and one's MIA. Although the steak was cooked as I asked it was cold. How long was it sitting on the pass??  The food was tasty, don't get me wrong. The letdown occurred between the kitchen and the table I think. The courses got mixed up or lost, and that ruined the whole experience. Normally I would have said something but this dinner was a gift which made it uncomfortable.  IF I ever eat there again I hope the service is better. The food is good, and probably better when it's warm, but I can't say for sure.  P.S. It wasn't busy when we went, so that wasn't the problem.",

I decided to go with the pizza with smoked salmon and caviar and although it may sound odd, it was really good.  This place is good for groups.  Not sure if its the best place for kids.

Bacon-wrapped Dates: We've seen this so many times before. The bacon wasn't evenly cooked - a portion is nice and crisp, and some portion is pink. 3/5  Octopus: Beautifully grilled, nice and tender. There's hummus at the bottom. 3/5  Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad: I think this proves the reason why people think healthy food is pricey. It is pricey for what it is and what it tastes like - uninspired. 1/5  The other dishes we tried and we're just ok: Calabrian Shrimp Pasta: 2.5/5 Lobster Roll: 2/5 Fried Chicken: 3/5",

It's air-y and some nights they have live music as well and service was fairly good.   What's bad: The food. I was there for happy hour so my review is based off of a lot of the happy hour bites. The jalapeno hummus was accompanied by a \"crispy lavosh\", which was really just a bland cracker. The harvest quinoa salad was OK (I did enjoy the dressing) and the chickpea chopped salad was just not good. The wings were tinnyyy (so get two orders if that's your dish of choice). To end on a positive note, the one satisfying plate was the sweet potato fries, mainly because of the Harissa yogurt that came with it. It was creamy and light!",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try for Father's Day because they were offering one free Entree for dad.   Dad and I almost always get two different plates and then share. After feeling very indecisive over all the good sounding options, we finally settled on Chicken & Waffles and the Pimento Cheeseburger. I felt like this took a little while to come out, but I was very hungry and they were pretty busy due to it being a holiday.   Unfortunately, when I food did arrive, we had a problem. We were pretty sure we'd been sent the wrong burger by mistake. There was no Pimento Cheese in sight. When I asked about it, they insisted that it was the right burger. I apologized, but said I didn't understand. Where was the Pimento Cheese?? They explained that it was underneath the patty....Well, all I saw was a mayo sauce that might have had Pimento in it. But the only Cheese was a slice of Cheddar on top of my burger. So this wasn't a burger \"with Pimento Cheese\" as the menu explained. Instead, it was a cheeseburger with a Pimento sauce. Again, I apologized and explained that we ordered this burger with something completely different in mind and really weren't interested or impressed with what came out and asked if we could possibly get something else. Thank goodness, the waitress said yes. So dad picked the adult grilled cheese.   While we waited on the new sandwich. We dug into the Chicken. It's served in the form of sandwich - one fourth of a waffle on the top and bottom with the chicken in between. I happened to take mine apart so I could put syrup all over to find something odd. While the top of my fried chicken looked normal, the underside was naked.....the meat was pulling away from the crunchy skin of batter and looked dry and unimpressive. So strange. And again, another problem of an inaccurate menu - the menu said the plate came with a wheat waffle. Nope. This was a regular waffle. And unfortunately, not even a good one. The whole thing was over soft and cakey. No crisp on the outside and fluff on the inside.   But finally or Grilled Cheese arrived and it made up for a number of sines by being pretty awesome! It was absolutely oozing a thick layer of cheese out the side. And the sweetness of the bacon jam perfectly paired with the soft, round flavor of the truffle.   When the bill came, I saw that they only charged us for the least expensive Entree! I appreciated this considering the food, on the whole, being less than impressive. Also, while out waitress was never rude exactly, she always made me feel like she only ever had two seconds to talk and something much more important to do. In the end, I'm going with a 3/5 because of the awesome grilled cheese and the good deal we were given when it came to price. But I can't say that I was given any real reason to come back and try something else. Especially since you can't trust the menu and dot actually know what you'll be getting.",

The prices are still expensive here but the quality of food allows you to justify the price.  We tried the hummus and buffalo wings for appetizers, those I thought were just mediocre.  The real star of the show was my lobster roll with brown butter aioli.  Yum!  I've lived on the east coast, so I know my way around lobster rolls.  The bread was nicely toasted and the lobster was generous and the brown butter aioli definitely helped elevate the flavors.  A few ladies ordered the pizzas and those also looked delicious.  I'm already planning my next trip back for the prime rib sandwich!  We were afraid that this place would not be kid friendly, so my husband and I have not come here with our daughter.  However, I saw quite a few families with kids and this place is loud, so screaming children can be drowned out by the noise.  Only knock, is it almost takes an act of God to get water refilled....",

It's close to the sportsbook if you want to make a bet and when the weather is nice it's all open to the outside unlike all the other closed bars. So you can enjoy the weather, watch football, and have a drink all at the same time. I highly recommend Hearthstone at any time of day.",

Some of the dishes are overcomplicated for no reason. I'd love some more simple dishes done well (like the wings, trust me).

I thought it tasted good, someone else thought the chicken lacked flavor. But everyone's taste buds are different, so you be the judge. I was disappointed that the free check in offer is only valid for dinner. Here's the issue: I don't know why restaurants don't separate the checks, it just makes it more difficult on the staff and there's ALWAYS a problem. I had a $20 off of $60 purchase coupon which helped, that I was able to use. We had about 17 people in our party. Thank goodness we all brought cash. For some reason, there was an extra amount of about $90 on our ticket and management couldn't figure out why. So what ended up happening is, 1 of the girls in our party was given a business card from accounting and would be notified when the issue was resolved. Never would've happened if they just gave us each our check with our own order. I'd probably return, just in a smaller number, so maybe, just maybe I can get my own individual receipt.",

    "text": "Hearthstone is located in Red Rock Casino which is so close to my new place so I was excited to try it out. We came with a larger group for cinco de mayo and actually planned on going to Mercadito, but Mercadito was slammed so we went next door instead.   Hearthstone is gorgeous!! Totally my scene, with big comfortable chairs and great ambiance. We decided to sit outside because it was such a nice day. I can totally imagine going there on a warm Vegas night and sitting outside enjoying myself. We had dinner reservations late on the strip so we just wanted to order a few apps and a couple drinks. However, I loved the variety of unique food options. They have flatbreads, jams, but some heftier dishes, as well.  I ordered a sparking sangria on drink special. It was very tasty, but at $12 it was less of a special and more of cocktail-on-the-strip prices. I also had just got the sparkling sangria a few days before at Kona Grill which was twice as good at a quarter of the price. I got the parmesan/truffle popcorn and the mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was just ok. I prefer stronger flavors and it was somewhat bland. However, the popcorn was so yummy and it was a large portion, enough to share with an entire table. I also enjoyed their presentation of the food on their menus. The service was attentive and friendly and the prices were somewhat high, but you have to remember that it is a casino restaurant.   I can't wait to come back with the girls for happy hour. Such a gorgeous place!",

The white sangria was refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet. The bacon wrapped dates were on the larger size, placed in a red sauce and the flavors were both sweet and savory. We also ordered the truffle popcorn, chicken wing lollipops and macaroni and cheese. I loved the wings! They had just enough buffalo sauce on them, the meat was tender and they were easy to eat without the typical chicken wing mess. The popcorn was a great snack layered with Parmesan cheese and just a hint of truffle oil. The mac and cheese was a little on the dry side for me but the noodles were cooked perfectly. This is a fun place with an open concept, eclectic furniture, a nice lounge area for quick drinks and socialization and a great patio. I will be back to try brunch or more of the menu.",

    "text": "The food is good but the reservation process is horrible and neither management nor the hostesses really care about your patronage.  We have tried a number of times and every time just to get a table it's so painful.  First time we had a reservation at 630 and they didn't sit us until 730 the hostesses were completely indifferent when mentioned. Worse yet when we finally did get in one hour late there are plenty of tables available.  Second time we tried to make reservation by calling ahead but it went straight to voicemail which indicated leave a message and someone will call you right back one hour later still no call back.  We arrived and mentioned this to the hostesses (both exhibiting a16 year old mentality with no clue) and basically got the \"oh duh\", \"the phone doesn't ring to us\" response. \"Sorry 1 hour wait\".  Wow.  We walked in looking for a bar spot .. Found a manager asked to help us..  Told him the entire situation .. His response was he asked us to sit on a couch for dinner. Thats not dining.  No thanks.  He wasn't even concerned about the experience we just had.  We told him we were going to the competitors. He said okay thank you.  Third attempt more of the same.  We spent some time talking to the hostess about our poor experience.. who said her father was a VP of such and such and that's why she got the job there. She admitted to having no experience and believe me it showed. She admitted they purposely stack reservations just to try and create a hype. Ridiculous.  Bottom line if you want to go somewhere where they don't care about you this is your spot considering there are dozens of other great restaurants in the area for both service and food (T Bones, Honey Salt, Echo and Rig, Wolfgang Pucks, Vinter Grill, Flemings, etc), the Light Group should really get their act together here.   We'd recommend staying away and leave it to the tourist to be forced to eat here with sub par experience.",

The food was delicious:  -Deviled eggs -Baked ricotta (MY FAV!) -Pepperoni flatbread  We also had some cocktails, champagne and a moscow mule-type of cocktail. The baked ricotta was my favorite! It came with crusty bread slices and a little pot of honey. The perfect starter.  End result, I will definitely return!",

Funny...the restaurant was completely empty many tables available and open for a group of 4 people. There were people at the bar, not sure why we were not offered to sit at the bar for cocktails. Being in the business myself, you never turn away customers when all your tables are empty.  A local in Summerlin and highly educated in customer service and training of employees. I was surprised that that the hostess would not seat us. The Yard House was packed and we were seated right away, The food was awesome at Yard House. I wish my first experience at Hearthstone would have been more favorable, but it was not. I find it very hard the entire restaurant was booked...when tables sat empty at 6pm.",

Then we Ordered the fp & j  (foie with pnut &jelly) and a charcuterie board. Thought it was a little tacky you had to pay extra for bread/ honey to come with your meat and cheese board, I have never seen this before but it was only 1$ so hey, whatever.. So we added on truffle honey and bread and purchased a bottle of wine all at the same time.  The food was fabulous! Cheese was perfect temp. Foie was so yummy. But no bread...we were Sat right next to the kitchens expo so I felt guilty bothering here but had to inquire about bread a few times, 10 min later our server shows up with 4 tiny pieces if bread. I ordered more right away. We had cheese, foie and rillette all requiring bread. 10 minutes later our bread order came, I ordered another right away.  Keep in mind we never got our bottle of wine. After the 3rd round of bread we cancelled the wine and told the server politely that we paid 15$ in bread and have waited over half an hour for wine and we weren't even able to finish our charcuterie board. She sent a Manager and they offered complimentary apps and we're really nice and apologetic but by that time we were over it. They comped our charcuteriebut our Bill was still about 100$ for the foi, some oysters and a glass of bubbles.  We most likely won't return. Any place that charges for bread that takes 10 min to get to your table and wine that takes 30+ min is not my cup of tea.",

    "text": "We have heard nothing but good things about the food at Hearthstone, and we were not disappointed there.  We tried several of their cocktails, as well as 7-8 tapas dishes, and we liked all of them.  Mushroom flatbread and Stuffed dates were both favorites.  Atmospherre was also great.  Very large open space, great decor.  Outside seating.  Best part is, the whole end of the restaurants opens up, to give the room an open air feel.  Can't beat the atmosphere.  The issue for us was the service.  We had a 6:30 reservation, arrived promptly.  The hostess said an outside table was available, and she would come get us at the bar - it was just being bussed.  20 minutes later she still had not come.  I went back to the hostess stand, and she apologized, saying the table still wasn't bussed, and this sometimes happened.   5 minutes later, a different hostess, with a different story, came to seat us, saying it was simpy a miscommunication.  Next issue - once seated, it was 10 minutes before anyone said a peep to us.  No menus, no \"I'll be right with you\", nothing.  Once the server came, she was very friendly, and excellent.    Final issue, we never got one of our tapas dishes.  We said somethning about midway through, and server checked, and said somethning happened.   Did not arrive until after we were done everything else.  As they are relatively new, we can certainly understand these issues, and will try them again.  Also, consideing how nice the atmosphere was, the delays, while they should not have happened, did not ruin the evening.",

The roasted chicken was OK, but the juice that was served with it was sweet instead of savory, and I didn't care for it very much.  The presentations were nice, but the flavor didn't hold up.  We were seated at a table with chairs, and after the first hour of waiting for our food, the seats were very uncomfortable.  Our table was next to a carving station where they cut up the whole suckling pigs that are an option on the menu.  While some people might enjoy watching a pig get carved up, we did not.  And the smell of the roasted pig detracted from our experience.  Hearthstone was loud, had poor service, and mediocre food.  We won't be back.

The bar was the only area that was providing service.  We were ignored by 2 bartenders for roughly 8 minutes.  They were speaking with the server and did not bother to great us.  I have them the benefit of the doubt and 7 minutes later there was still no greeting.  The experience was very disappointing.  My wife and I walked out disenchanted.",

    "text": "My daughter and I went here for Christmas and found that it was a pleasant choice to fit in with an excellent film that we had seen earlier. The service was excellent, perhaps because the restaurant has a large staff to unobtrusively take care of all diners. They had a \"Christmas Menu\" that seemed high priced at $55.00 a person for almost no choices and food we didn't like. We decided on less expensive a la carte items from the menu which turned out good. I pictured the restaurant being cozy, in keeping with its name. Actually it was a large dining room with widely space tables, a few booths and a counter with views of the kitchen. At first this was disappointing since we were hoping for Christmas decorations. After a few minutes the dining room felt fine, except we were near an entry from outside. Whenever (not often) someone came in, a blast of cold air momentarily hit us. I'd say our experience was very good. Our modest dinner was about $100 with tip and without alcoholic beverages or dessert. Not bad in Las Vegas these days.",

Ultimately, while the menu sounds pretty good the restaurant is truly nothing special. The big issue was service, which I will mostly attribute to dining outside but who knows. Long wait for the menus, for the drinks, for refills, for the check...etc. Food came out quickly though. But then of course the food was nothing to rave about. Three things ordered: truffle chicken pizza, hanger steak, and lobster roll. The pizza was good but basically just tasted like a white pizza, the hanger steak was fine but nothing special, and the lobster roll was also fine but kind of bland. Food portions were pretty small and the bill was upwards of $100 which seems like a lot for what we got. Ultimately, if I have a choice between this and ordering 50 quesalupas from t bell I will choose the latter.",

    "text": "I'll try to break this review down a bit more than my last (first). I went with a co-worker from the UK.  The atmosphere/look is great, one of the best I've seen here. It doesn't feel like a Strip restaurant. I went at 7pm, around 8 they lower the lights and turn up the music, unnecessary but not bad.    The service was strange, we didn't have one server, so this left us trying to grab someone when we wanted to order an additional item or ask a question. The bartender was the only who made a suggestion. I tried the margarita with carrot juice, a little spicy but very good.    The food was good--not great. We had a meat and cheese board, we opted for the \"chef's choice\"  because there were so many cheeses and meats to choose from. I thought it would give us an exciting variety but for the price it was underwhelming and a small amount. We also had the stuffed dates which were delicious. I had the rib dish for my entree which was fantastic and my co-worker had a pepperoni flat bread dish which he wasn't a fan of.  For dessert I had an item no longer on the menu which was the only chocolate option-- it was so bad! The server covered it in this almond sauce that then drowned it and made it mush -- steaming almond mush...    so overall I think a three is pretty good, I will definitely come back but I will switch it up and see what else this establishment has to offer. I would still recommend it.",

We ordered our food immediately with the drink order. We ordered the charcuterie it was pretty lame. I feel that it was compared to store bought lunch meat. The crackers were fresh from a box oh and the whole mustard seed mustard. It was close to what I ate when I was 5 years old and ate a lunch able except the lunch able was much fresher. The entree we ordered was the pizza which some smart expediter put a fist full of salt on the top of the pizza which, made it near impossible to eat. The sides we ordered were potatoes which were the best thing and the Mac and cheese which was undercooked pasta (not al dente but raw). I was told by many people this place was great! Not sure if I would give this place another shot.",

    "text": "I went to Hearthstone last night with my family for my birthday. Food was good, service was absolutely off point. First off we started with one server and then 29 minutes later had another server. Second round of drinks took three times asking about them and 40 minutes to actually get. Manager did come to table and apologize and took care of those for us. That's fine. Good recovery. Hoped things would get better. They did not. We ordered the roasted potatoes, we asked about them a few times and never got them. Ended up asking them to be removed from our bill. The wrong flat bread was brought to us because our waitress pressed the wrong button. Then the Bronzino we ordered with our entrees to share was also never received because it was never written down when we ordered it. It was a mess. Which is really sad because the food was pretty damn good! Apart from the jalapeno hummus. This was bland. There was no jalapeno flavor and needed salt. The wood fire clams were very good, but are served in an amazing broth and no bread to sop it up with. I did ask for bread because it was a very tasty broth. Plus the items are shared so you can't really pass the bowl around to eat with a spoon. We had a lot of other items that were all good. Drinks were very good, however I got the Pimm's 50 first and then the blackberry drink and then another Pimm's 50 which didn't look like the first one I got, so there was some inconsistency there.   I know this isn't the most eloquent review but I just want Hearthstone to know that the restaurant is beautiful inside. The menu is lovely and the food is very good for the most part. What ruined it for myself and my family was the service and all the mistakes made last night. We didn't even stay to look at or get dessert, and I'm a pastry chef, I love to check out other desserts and menus. We just wanted our of there. Will I go back? Yeah, sure, not anytime soon though. This place needs to get their service in order first. Which is really unfortunate because the food is worth coming back for.",

Personally this place seems to be an attempt to bring The Strip restaurant experience to Summerlin. Perhaps all the Summerlin and Summerlin wanna-be folks that are into the scene will keep it going. However, I can think of several places to eat nearby that are two-thirds of the price or less.",

    "text": "Went here for a business dinner this week.    The look of the restaurant is trendy and okay but in no way inviting for an extended meal.  Tables for a party of more than four are high-tops with exceedingly uncomfortable bar chairs.  One of our party has had knee replacement and couldn't have her leg hanging from the stool/chair for and extended time.  We asked for one of the lobby stools to be brought over for her to rest her foot on; the wait staff was unable to accommodate this and told us it would have to be a manager (the manager never showed) but the wait staff kept coming by to find out if the manager had satisfied our request (we were there nearly 3 hours it never happened).  Everything in the restaurant is hard surfaces which leads to a very LOUD room, the only saving grace to this was the staff didn't increase the volume of the music with the volume of the patrons.  As it was it was so loud you could only hear the person immediately next to you, forget about having a cohesive group conversation with the 7 people we had there for dinner.  The wait staff is done \"team style\" which is good in theory but leads to a lot of disconnect between what we asking for versus what we were being given.  Regarding the food: Its billed as rustic American cuisine; however, its very French and Italian - sorry but this gave me a chuckle as I was reviewing the menu.   Cocktails -   Mojito - she returned it as undrinkable Red Sangria - she said it was alright but rather weak in flavor. Bottle of red wine - unsure of what it was but the others started doing internet searches on its value and rating which led me to believe they weren't overly impressed with it. Appetizers -  Abe Froman flatbread - was told that it was good but way to heavy with fennel for my taste. Carbonara  Flatbread - was alright, I've had better. Roasted Artichokes with Black Truffle Yogurt - this was pretty tasty and we all seemed to enjoy it. Dinner - We had several with duplicate food orderings. Rotisseri Chicken & Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Jalapenos  and Roast  Broccoli- Chicken was okay, moist not dried out, could have done without the charred thyme stalks. Potatoes were tasty but randomly seasoned.  Was told that the broccoli was not worth ordering again. Wagyu Burger Special - he said it was good but only ate half of it so I was left wondering. Wagyu Short Ribs - he seemed to be satisfied with his. Pesto Shrimp Pasta - was told it was good but she felt over priced. Desert -  Peanut Butter Lava Cake - everyone said this was good but they couldn't have more than a couple of bites. Apple Tart - was very good according to all. Blood Orange Sorbet - was really looking forward to this and sorely disappointed, tasted like it was made with Tang and red food coloring.  All in all I'm glad someone was able to put this on their expense account.  I don't see that any of us that live here will be returning for another meal.",

When I first started coming here, about a year ago, I really wasn't too overly excited about it...but something kept drawing me back and now I'm loud and proud and don't care who knows it.  I love the sharing plates, which are just the perfect size for 2-3 people so that you can sample several items at a time (the meatballs, the lollipop chicken wings, stuffed dates, meat and cheese boards).  And, with the updated menu items like the shaved brussels sprout caesar salad, lobster roll, chicken pot pie, baked honey truffle ricotta (I dream about it, I do) you're ensured happy tastebuds no matter what you choose.  My favorite standby is their cheeseburger, made with pimiento cheese.  I can't stress enough how delicious that burger is.  Also, try happy hour with the mini menu items to get even more for your mouth.  The staff is always friendly and the service pretty efficient, and the atmosphere open and inviting.  Whether you want to go for a drink and a game of shuffle board, or sit in the comfy couches and chat with friends, or sit on the patio and enjoy the Summerlin outdoors, you'll always find that there's a spot depending on your mood.  Oh, and don't forget about Sunday brunch.  It's spot on, with limitless mimosas, amazing baked goods and various sweet and savory offerings guaranteed to please.",

    "text": "I have never written a bad review, and I really wanted to like this place, with the cute and trendy decor, but it was extremely disappointing. Service was very very slow and the server was abrupt and couldn't answer extremely basic questions about menu items. As and server myself, I try to cut everyone some slack, but this was pretty substandard, especially for a restaurant with this price point. I went for Sunday brunch for a friend's birthday. I ordered the bottomless bellinis for 24 dollars, which I only got 3 of over the course of 2.5 hrs, while having to wait 15-20 min after I finished each beverage. Also, even though the waiter said the bottomless drinks were pre-made, every drink I received tasted extremely different, with one being all champagne to one being extremely sweet and juicy. The same inconsistencies were applied to the other bottomless bloody beers my friends ordered, the first one being extremely tomato based, and others being beer heavy. I also ordered the D. O. C. Pizza (18 dollars for personal sized pizza), which is basically a margarita pizza. I would say that 4 of the 8 pieces had just plain marinara and nothing else (not even cheese or herbs), and the other 4 pieces had small circles of lukewarm cheese and about 5 small pieces of basil over the entire pizza. My friend ordered the California Egg Benedict, and the egg whites were translucent and runny and inedible unless you like mostly raw egg. We wanted to send our food back, but since we were at the restaurant at the request of our friend for her birthday, we didn't want to complain or cause a scene. Overall, my extremely awful excuse for a pizza and drinks were 42 bucks before tax and tip, and I honestly can say little caesars take out pizza is inifnitely better. I feel like the trendiness of the decor coupled with the wine/charcuterie vibe of the place is giving it hype, but I would never return to pay this much for food or beverages for brunch or any other meal. Try Mercadito next door. Really great food and delicious cocktails.  I've been a server in high end restaurants for years and spending money has never been an issue for me as long as the food/drink quality and service were worth it, but definitely not for hearthstone. I wouldn't pay half of what I paid.",

Happy hour is offered everyday from 5-7 pm, then reversed happy hour is offered on Saturday night. The happy hour has a good variety of options to offer... cant beat $6 bucks for good, quick food!  This restaurant has a lot to offer during the week as well. On Mondays, they have a special which offers guests half off of a $100 priced bottle of wine.. and they have a LARGE selection of red and white wines. On Wednesdays they offer $1 FRESH oysters. On Thursdays they have a private cellar for guests. Live music Friday and Saturday (great acoustic singer) and an overall fun environment to be in. On Sunday, brunch is offered. They also are open on holidays and offer special menus for each holiday... amazing.  The staff is very polite, kind, and caring. The servers offer great service, the hostesses are very sweet, and if there is a problem, the managers are extremely helpful. They are a joy to dine with!  The food is FRESH. It is an American Rustic style cuisine, has a lot of variety. I absolutely love how this restaurant has a fresh shellfish selection. The shrimp pasta, fried chicken, and hanger steak are to die for. Excellent quality food.  The design of the restaurant has a good feel to it. I really like how this restaurant has couches towards the back of the restaurant, it makes a more cozy environment. They have a bar, pizza counter, dining tables, nice booths, and hightop tables. I like how there is a variety of options of seating.  Overall, one of the best restaurants I have dined at and enjoyed everything they have to offer! Definitely recommend!",

Save your money and irritation and go next door to Libre and get what you are paying for.....the food.  To put the icing on the cake our service was great, until our server ran our card for another tables tab! 33.00 for more than what our tab was... Now we wait 3 to 5 days for a 33.00 credit.

As soon as we sat down I couldn't help but enjoy the aromas of different dishes being led to their destination.  We finally got our menu and to our surprise, it felt like we're paying for the ambiance.  OVERPRICED.  The flatbread pizza we shared was $18 and equivalent to a personal pizza, let's say CPK.  We settled on that because we only went in with intentions to share an appetizer, but found that the flatbread was the same price (I'll let you imagine what the prices were for entrees, which were the size of appetizer dishes!) .  Once again, good food, but needless to say we will not be coming back.",

We ordered the deviled eggs which were alright as well. We also had the bone marrow which I loved. We ordered a cheese and meat board which is their thing there. We weren't overly impressed by this either.  For an entree I got the Salmon Carpaccio which was really good.  Their sangria was excellent along with their Blueberry Bliss cocktail. Our meal experience didn't feel like it was really worth the cost however. I would like to come here for brunch some time and enjoy the nice outdoor seating.",

She offered to seat me at a table, in which i declined . I prefer to sit at the bar so I sat myself! Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and dropped menus. One for happy hour (who doesn't love happy hour) a full dinner menu and a drink menu. After looking over the menu I ordered the happy hour buffalo wings as a recommendation from the bartender. WOW. Simple, to the point and SO BOMB! I don't like spicy food so I was hesitant but tried it anyways. Six bucks how can I lose? Not too spicy, little tangy and mouthwatering! Should have taken a picture before eating because they were gone before I remembered. Next I ordered the shrimp ceviche off the dinner menu. It's a different twist on the traditional ceviche I am used to but another winner! Easily! This one I got a picture of first before devouring! Has little chunks of watermelon in it. Yummy and very refreshing! Paired this one with a nice Pinot Grigio  by the glass, they carry one of my favorites Santa Margarita! Have j told you how I love this place? Lastly I ordered the Hanger steak, medium rare! I got it and was impressed and also thankful! Yes... Thankful lol They cut the steak for you before sending it out! Saves you time and you can just get down to business, lol! They cooked it to my liking and the steak fries that come with it.. YUM! Sarah the manager came by asked how everything was I told her I love this place and can't wait to share my future experiences with friends! See you again real soon Hearthstone! My experience tonight was amazing!",

    "text": "I really love Hearthstone. My first experience with them was last Thanksgiving as our plans fell through to go visit family, so we were left wandering around looking for where to eat a Thanksgiving meal. We saw that Hearthstone was doing an endless turkey dinner, and my husband and I LOVED it. They really saved Thanksgiving for us. If they do it again this year, and you don't feel like cooking, you have got to try it!  I've been twice for brunch. Their quinoa salad is great, and last time I splurged calories wise and got the egg sandwich. The thick buttery toast is sooooooooo good. My husband usually gets the egg bennies. My bottomless mimosa glass is never left empty, either.  I planned a girls' night at Hearthstone last night, and that finally pushed me to write a review. I swear they must hire the nicest, most adorable people to work here! From the hostess stand to our waiter, everyone is so sweet. And I always feel so super bad for having to itemize receipts on a group dinner, but when I get the $39 halibut and someone else gets a $13 salad, it is what it is. They did it with a smile though, which is sincerely appreciated as I know it blows when you have 5 girls throw down 5 cards with various amounts needing to be charged.   Dinner is on the pricey side (depending on what you order), but I got a hearty portion of halibut, so I consider it a girls' night treat. Their brunch is really reasonable and comparable if you want to dip your toes in the water first.",

I'm giving Hearthstone 3 stars, because the service was great and I love the ambiance of the place.   The only thing that I'm still not sold on is the food. I'd have to come again and try some of their other items to really see if this place truly deserves a thumbs up or thumbs down... we will see.  I had a Sangria, which was pretty darn strong and the waitress was nice enough to remake it for me.   I also had their braised short rib meatballs in tomato sauce and it was a bit spicy for my taste. It was still decent, but I've definitely tasted better. Waaaay better.  My husband had the chocolate shuffle and he wasn't really impressed by it not 1 bit or should I say bite. He also had their house cabernet and we both agreed that $16 a glass seemed like a rip off.  Overall our bill for 1 dessert,  small meatballs tapas, 1 cocktail, 1 glass of red wine  for $60 and then add a 15% tip was a little overkill. I really don't mind spending a good amount of money on fancy food, but it has to taste good and this just did not.  In a nutshell this was a little too high for food that was very poorly executed, but this won't be my last visit. I still look forward to seeing what else this place has to offer.  At this point I would only recommend this place for drinks and thats about it for now. Until next time foodie friends!",

The service has always been excellent and the ambiance can't be matched in the area. It's got a rustic American feel. They do Oyster towers for brunch as well as their famous wood-fired pizzas. A must try is the Huckleberry Caramel French toast with banana bourbon syrup. It's on the sweeter side, but mind-blowing. Have an Uber (shameless plug) on standby after this Boozy brunch.",

The hostess asked if we had a reservation and when we said no they quickly said that they were \"fully committed,\" but could put us on a waiting list. We were completely fine with the wait until we started looking around and there were A TON of open tables. After asking about the open tables the girls repeated that they were \"fully committed,\" and we could not be seated at any of the open tables. Disappointed, we decided to go eat at one of the nearby restaurants. Our car was parked in the Red Rock parking lot so we walked back through Hearthstone and (not to our surprise) they STILL had a bunch of tables opened.   Knowing the restaurant business turning away business is always a bad thing to do. I give Hearthstone 2 stars because the decor was right up my alley. Maybe one day I will be lucky enough to get a table and be able to update my review. As for now I would rather stick to my favorite restaurants.",

My food was also really good! We sat on the patio and there was a view of the mountains to look at the entire brunch. Before we got our food the manager came up to us and said there was a seating issue and asked if we would mind moving to a two person table (we were sitting at a 4 top), and of course we didn't mind. But beyond that, he said he would take care of our mimosas for the trouble. I have never had a restaurant do that before. Amazing hospitality!! Will definitely be returning.",

We also has the crispy brussel sprouts which are a most try.. super good. The herb green salad was good as well. The sweet potato fries were great as well. Best to make reservations.

We then watched her go to another table (that was seated after us) and take their order. At this point we walked out.",

The open kitchen and bar idea is really cool. Definitely a cool vibe and ambiance inside as well as outside. The only thing I didn't like about the outside were the tables and chairs. The inside is very open with lots of table and booths along the wall. However, I did feel like this place had an identity crisis. Open atmosphere and great intimate lighting only to be thrown off by a bunch of big screen TV's all over the place with the football game on. A mix between a sports bar and a really nice restaurant.   Service here was impeccable. Hostess, server, waiter, down to the restaurant manager. All very nice, attentive, and on top of everything.   The food here is where this place really shines.   We ordered pretty much the entire menu:  Bacon wrapped stuffed dates - awesome  Meat and Cheese board - great!  Baked Ricotta dish - my favorite!  Calamari - great  Chicken Truffle Flatbread - great  Meatball and ricotta flatbread - delicious  Apple and quinoa salad - great!  Scallops - Cooked perfectly  Hanger Steak - good, next time I should order it medium.    Peanut butter lava cake - Fire! So good!  Chocolate Souffle - good, not worth the 15 minute wait  Great place with great food! Will definitely be back - especially to try the brunch!",

Wasn't to busy so we were able to get right in. The service was okay, but very slow. We waited 15 minutes for water to come to our table and another 5 minutes for our bloody Mary's. We ordered and it took another 20 minutes, and by this time I was starving. The waiter was very apologetic for the wait , but I tend to be very patient with the staff as well.

I like that you can see outside almost anywhere you're seated, & if a sports fan there are enough not-in-your-face screens.  It's great to see all ages represented here, thus also making it feel community-oriented.  On this visit we had the quinoa salad for two as well as the sausage/fennel/garlic pizza.  The salad is delectable & crunchy, but didn't have any of the Gouda cheese listed on menu (though we'd definitely give it another go).  The pizza crust is just right, not too thick, & actually flavorful.  All ingredients were fine also & the only complaint is that of before:  too salty.  The pizzas are also listed on the happy hour menu but are only big enough for one @ $6.00.  Their house red on happy hour is a good one & wine & beer are $6.00.  Note:  A number of restaurants with excellent happy hour pizzas are full size, for $6-8.00.  Just sayin' Hearthstone.  If I have a complaint, it's what  they can't remedy:  the noise level, at any hour of the day.",

    "text": "When we arrived last night, I immediately noticed the beautiful interior of this place. With the rustic charm of the decor, this place has a cozy and lush ambience. We were seated outside on the beautiful patio. This place has a prime time location if you are looking to see a movie at Red Rock or go to the casino afterwards.   The service throughout the night was 5 stars. My server was very knowledgeable and helpful and made sure we were satisfied.   Now to the food. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings happy hour deal, which were buttery and well coated. We also got the Wood Roasted Octopus which I really enjoyed. There is a smoky flavor to the octopus, so only get this if you like that charbroiled taste. The Tuna Tartare was nice as well with the accent of the apples and hazelnuts.   For the main entrees, we shared the Lobster Roll, the Catch of the Day Halibut, Truffle Chicken Pizza, Truffle Pasta, and Lamb. My two favorites were the Lobster Roll and the Lamb. The lobster roll was well toasted and buttery against the cold lobster salad medley inside. The lamb was super delicious and had that gamey fresh lamb flavor that I love. It came with two big portions of lamb rack over buttery mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, and what tasted like a red wine reduction.   I personally did not try the Halibut, but someone in my group did not enjoy it too much because of the \"fishiness\" of it. I personally love truffle anything in general, but I was let down some by both the truffle chicken pizza and the truffle pasta. The pizza was on the drier side and needed something extra, and I also could barely taste any truffle on it. The truffle pasta was better since I could clearly taste the truffle, but the sauce was on the clumpier and heavy side. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the sauce was a bit smoother.   For dessert, we got the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. I loved the bread pudding part of this dessert along with the ice cream. It was dense and moist and not too sweet. I only wish they accented this dish with a flavor combo other than cherries. I think caramel, white chocolate, or even blueberries would have been better.  All in all, I had a really good time. I would definitely come back to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Was decent. Food was the primary reason this review got 3 stars. The best thing about this restaurant was it's atmosphere. It does have inside and outdoor seating which you can request. There are lounge booths, barstool tables, and dining table to eat at.   As for the food, we ordered the lobster $24(?) Special, and the lobster was not super flakey, was very gooey, and reeked of salt water. Undercooked. The Truffle Pasta, was a little dry but had excellent flavor. I was told by other members in my party that the brussel sprouts weren't the best they had; but the fried chicken had an amazing sweet batter it was fried in.  The most disappointing part for me is that it was my birthday, and the birthday cake that came out was EXTREMELY soft, melted, and droopy. Honestly, this is the worst birthday cake I've had at a restaurant. I'm surprised they would even think it's remotely okay to display a cake in that condition. You could see the frosting melting down the sides. The cookie that came with it I wasn't a fan of, it was hard as a rock. I took the puddle of cake home with me, but there was no point in eating the bed mess, so I threw it away with when I got home.  I'm not really sure if I would go back to eat. Probably not. Wouldn't recommend either. For such a small menu, they should focus more on their quality. But it is a great hangout spot, as there are also TV's around the restaurant.",

Second visit for brunch, we choose the patio and were seated with the sun beaming on us. We asked our server if we could move to a table with shade. He came back and told us we could move but that table is booked in 1 hour and 15 mins so we need to be done by then. Um excuse me but there were tons of tables still available on the patio and I just felt that comment wasn't needed by him. (They offer bottomless mimosas that are premixed with heavy pulp OJ, not very good, but bottomless) Good thing he wasn't going to be our server any longer. Our new server was fine. Food though no bueno. Had bread pudding French toast that was so soggy on it's own and they even had a side of syrup? Like it wasn't soggy enough.   Overall the service blah. Food could be awesome or a complete miss.",

Their only downfall is the food. It's overpriced and underwhelming.   My first visit to Hearthstone was during brunch. I am a firm believer that's it's nearly impossible to ruin breakfast -- until now. My breakfast potatoes were over cooked and bland. Even drowning them in ketchup couldn't do the trick. The breakfast sandwich was decent, but I could have ordered something similar for a fraction of the cost at Kneaders. Granted, you have the same ambience that Hearthstone is known for.   My husband ordered the French toast, which sounded better than it actually tasted. I thought that maybe my husband and I just ordered the wrong items, but until our friend was disappointed with her eggs Benedict.   I figured I would give them another shot, so I stopped by for happy hour/ $1 Presidents Day pizzas. My hummus lacked flavor and the pizza sauce was too salty. They offered veggie sliders (plural), but it was actually just one lonely slider. My husband devoured his, but my tastebuds never had the pleasure enjoying it because there was only one. Even our server was shocked to see only one slider. A new set of friends joined us, but weren't impressed with the food either.   Hearthstone reminds me of a really attractive guy or girl with no substance. It's just plain disappointing!",

Our server Jade was really attentive and we were seated at a nice both in the middle of the restaurant. Also, they have live music on Saturday nights. My bf and I ordered the raging bull and flower bomb. Both drinks were very good. For the appetizer we ordered the small shellfish platter (came with 3 oysters, 3 shrimp, and one lobster claw), 3 oysters, bacon wrapped dates (just okay), and a ricotta dip (highly recommend)! For the entree we shared the special which was a branzino with lobster risotto. Honestly, best fish I've had in a while. Fish was cooked to perfection, nice and flaky flesh with crispy skin. For dessert we had nutella and chocolate pot that came with two warm cookies. Great way to end the dinner",

Everyone was very personable and attentive. Our server, I think his name was Amit/Amir (if you read this please forgive me for not remembering correctly) but man he was AMAZING! He gave great suggestions and had quite a sense of humor, and with our family that's a must!  Drinks were so good and refreshing, I suggest trying the flower Bomb!   Started with the baked truffle ricotta and that was nice and creamy with a hint of sweetness from the honey.  The shrimp and grits was absolutely delicious. So creamy and silky, it didn't look like a huge helping, but I couldn't finish the last two shrimps which is unheard of for me!  The fried chicken was crispy and juicy with a lil honey to top it off. The cheddar bacon biscuit so soft and flaky.   The sea bass with lobster risotto...are you kidding me!!! So good!!  The s'mores dessert was different than I've ever had. A cake with marshmallow fluff and chocolate chips.   Everything was so deelish I cant wait to go back for brunch!",

I got an egg added on for $3 (!) extra. They forgot the egg initially so I ended up with a fried egg side.  So, let's start with the least regrettable, the dollar pizza. It was terrible, in taste and texture.  Like something you would find at a chuck e cheese.  So how on earth could this be the least regrettable? Because it only cost me a dollar, which is only one more dollar than it was worth.  The burger on the other hand, was a $20 mistake. And terrible, lifeless, like something that came out of a frozen package. The $3 egg wasn't even good. The burger left a bad aftertaste, too. Yuck!  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this place. It was dreadfully bad. One of the worst meals I have had in vegas...or anywhere else.",

The kitchen scribbled initials on the wax paper to know what goes where though they did not obviously illustrate to us what was what. Servers (2 that I asked) didn't know anything productive about the product.   Ambience was really hip and they have shuffle board which I love.",

    "text": "Unable to give a review on quality of food because we left. Wanted to try out the the chicken wings yesterday for the all you can eat. Was in town from Chicago visiting family, so my brother wanted me to check it out. Once seated and drinks ordered, we placed out order. To our surprise we were told that everyone at our table had to order wings. Well one of us doesn't eat chicken and wanted to order something different and double the price of the wings. We were told \" no can do \". Which I find completely ridiculous.  Believe it or not,  some people don't eat chicken. How this restaurant couldn't accommodate an individual that doesn't eat chicken is bewildering.  If you are stead fast in that policy, then make sure it's posted or noted prior to patrons entering your establishment.  Very disappointed, I was looking forward to the experience",

I've had the charcuterie board, Mac and Cheese (basic but amazing), pizza, salad, fried chicken, and beef tartare. I absolutely love the food. Not sure if anything there is bad.   Ambiance. Is so awesome. I love the layout, the TV's are everywhere. Perfect place to watch a game. Just a really cool spot to eat or drink at.   Only bad thing...is the service. I've never waited to long for a drink. Each drink takes about 15 mins. Our server Shahenna never once asked how our food was. Mind you the 4 of us in the bar area had a $250 bill. It would of been way more if someone wanted to help serve us. We would of ordered more food or drinks. She was definitely not feeling us that night. The group of guys behind us got their water before we got asked if we wanted anything. They got refills before we got a drink. Seems like the table that was spending money would of got faster service.   Either way this place is awesome. Service is something that can easily be fixed.",

    "text": "Decided to go for dinner before are movies starts. There is 4 of us. Wife and me and another couple. Showed up at happy hour just are luck as this was are first time at the restaurant. Hostess sat us outside patio awesome. The waiter come over with menus we asked for the happy hour menu then he informed us there was no happy hour on the patio. We told him the hostess told us happy hour was patio friendly he checked with the manager (kinda weird) he came back with happy hour menus and said we were good to go. Noticed only certain cocktails were listed for happy hour no problem. Appetizers were half off same as certain cocktails and a couple of red wine selections. Told the waiter other than the cocktails and champagne we would order food from the Happy hour menu. Order jalapeno hummus was awesome.  Pigs in a blanket also good. Chicken wings also good. Waiter was very polite. Time to go movie starts in 20 min. Asked for the check the girls notice it was a little high. Paid the bill then noticed we were charged full price for appetizers and the red wine. No big deal a honest over site we thought. Well we were SO wrong. Waiter began telling us the red wine he brought her was not on happy hour menu (how would we know)and instead of $6 per glass it was $13 per glass. The red wine he brought (Cabernet) was not on the happy hour menu. The appetizers we ordered from the menu he doubled the orders we had no idea cause the waiter didn't inform us. When we asked him he told us that he would talk with the manager to try and straighten it out. Well 25 min later (now late for the movie now) the manager appears and explains what happened. They partially reduced the check. Waiter not seen again. The waiter new exactly what he was doing \"really\" doubling orders and not informing the customers. 6 appetizers and 5 titos and 2 glasses of champagne and 3 glasses of wine Original check $210.00  Check reduced by $12 dollars as manager explained she forgot to reduce the 3 glasses of wine from $13 each to $6 each.  That some of the appetizers were not from the happy hour menu (again how would we know) Wow super disappointed. As we're are locals and seen many restaurants come and go. Let's check back on this place. As it was Saturday night and maybe a 12 tables in the whole restaurant had customers.  Seemed to be classic bait and switch.  So absolutely NOT recommend save the aggravation and explaining to the people that work there how we feel really miss lead, how we couldn't of be any more clear to the waiter.",

For dinner we started with the pigs in a blanket and the charcuterie board which were both very good. For my entree I had the apple & quinoa salad and split the D.O.C. pizza with a friend. Both were so yummy. The pizza is made in a wood fired oven and it makes it taste so much better than normal pizza!  Hearthstone is one of the best brunch places I've been. The pancakes are soooo good and the croissant is very good as well. Everything is a pretty large portion which makes it even better.  If you haven't been to Hearthstone yet, you need to go!!!",

All of the other food came out and they forgot about the pizzas. None of the food was worth it at all! The chicken sandwich from the lunch menu had barely anything in it served with a pile of cold fries. Asked the waiter numerous time for refills and never brought us more until we got the attention of a bus boy to refill them. Definitely not a good experience on Mother's Day! Will not be back!",

Mind you this is after we waited 20 for someone to bring our party waters. No cocktail order was taken, which really sucked. The table next to us sent back their pizza, when we left they too still had no pizza. Left an email for the manger and of course NO response, can't be surprised at this considering the shit show they were running. The food may be good but I literally wouldn't know since it never came. So if you're looking for a restaurant, that takes your order and never brings your food, with zero cocktails, and an absentee manager that won't respond then knock yourself out. I never write reviews but I just had to, this place sucks",

    "text": "Hearthstone lost four customers for False advertising and terrible customer service. My wife and I went with another couple to last Thursdays Wine event 9pm till 11pm. It is a RSVP only event. We received a invite by email and printed tickets for the event. This was our first time visiting this new Restaurant. We have been looking forward to it since it opened. The Restaurant is beautiful but customer service is terrible. The music was way to loud for a wine event, no one could really talk to each other without yelling. The real issue we had with this place was the terrible service by the two waitresses serving the event area. I asked one young lady where the free appetizers  were. She informed me that they don't do that anymore it was something they did when they first started the events but have stopped. I explained it was in the email and on the tickets and that was not a good way to do business. I then asked her to bring us menu's. It took about 15 minutes to get them and from another waitress. I then asked this young lady about the appetizers too and she had no clue and was going to ask the manager. I told her please do and that we were going to order something off the menu either way. She never returned. We watched her and the first waitress wait on only certain people around us. The people they waited on were younger people about the waitresses ages. The older customer seemed to be ignored. Not sure what that was about. So after 2 very good glasses of wine that they did give us free (separate wine server) as part of the event. We all were very hungry and decided to go next door to Mercadito and order food and drinks. We were not disappointed. The service was outstanding and the food and drinks were great. We bought a couple bottles of wine at Mercadito too, which we were going to buy a few bottles at Hearthstone but never had the chance. So we highly recommend Mercadito and would suggest passing on Hearthstone until they step up their game. Very disappointed because it is a beautiful place and the menu and wine list looks great but it does not matter if service sucks.   One last note. We commented on this issue on Hearthstones facebook page under the Wine event post and they deleted it and never commented or messaged us back. So remember, only positive feedback will they share on social media. That is why I decided to go to Yelp and post.",

We dined here on Friday excited to go to a new fun restuarant and all parties agreed it was \"ok\" for the price.  Beautiful restuarant, ambiance, but service, food needed much work.  So....here is the reason for my 1 star.  Tonight we took a friend for a birthday dinner, I was the only person in out party that had expierence Hearthstone and I was the one that suggested this restuarant.  The service was incepredibly bad, they were out of the crudites which was on the menu so subbed for \"everything alacart, which totaled $20.00.  The cheese was suppose to be bri and was a mixture of goat cheese and something else and  amounted to a teaspoon of cheese.  We ordered roasted  beets, carpaccio, fries, a ricotta dip that looked and tasted like glue.  I recommended the pasta which took about 40 minutes and actually we thought maybe they forgot about the order.  We requested a glass of wine and after 20 minutes I went to the reception desk and asked for the manager.  I expressed my displeasure  and embarrassment for bringing my friends here, he took the wine off (big deal) but never came over to talk with us about the bad service and believe me; you would think after expressing your displeasure things would get better...they got worse.  Here is a summary of my back to back dining experiences.  1) bad service 2) very high prices for the quantity/ quality of food  3) after addressing my concerns with the servers and managers...NO ONE really cared!!!  They all looked at you like a deer in headlights!!!!  Not exaggerating!!! 4) A manager never came over once and said I'm sorry for your bad expierence, what can we do to make this better....hey at least a BJ's they train the managers to \"act\" like they care! 5) I called when I got home to discuss this with the manager who never came on the phone which left me no other outlet but to write this review. 6) I am not looking for anything \"free\". If you are going to charge these prices you better have the quality and service to support your restuarant. 7) you have just lost 6 people in 3 days that will never return....Im surprised the Fratitas have you on the property....I know they have higher standards than this!",

Will be going back soon to try out the food. Keep up the excellent service Tien and great attitude It's hard to find that now these days. Will be asking for you again. Awesome Place!",

Your entree does not come with a side so on top of the $30-$40 entree you are paying $7 for a side dish.  Although I can appreciate the concept, I wont run back to eat here in the near future.  I ordered the short rib, it was very tender and flavorful but again I cant justify the $30 price tag when I've been to other restaurants who offer short rib dishes with choice of sides for less money.  I typically do not base my reviews on prices as I appreciate quality but these portions were almost appetizer size.",

We just walked in and though we couldn't get a table, the hostess told us we could sit at the bar. There  were only two spots  so we tried to sit and the bartender quickly said nope, reserved.   That was slightly annoying, but we were able to sit at the pizza bar. Enrico was making the pizzas and he's super friendly and made us a heart shaped margherita pizza...Delish!  We ordered oysters caviar (bomb....love fresh oysters that taste like the sea) and the octopus (texture soft and on point). A food runner tried to give us the fois gras but we said we didn't order it. Then our server, Alex, came back with it compliments of the chef. I can never pass up fois!    Loved the server Alex, she was super sweet and knowledgeable. We wanted to order more but got too full.   Bonus points for half off bottles of wine under $100 that night!",

The service was weird. It was very hard to get our servers attention, and when she made deliveries...she barely stopped at the table. It was like a drive by.

I had to ask what the fish of the day was and the server dug through her notebook to find a scrap of paper she had written it on a read it off in a bored tone mispronouncing many of the ingredients. Besides that she was barely around and incredibly hard to get the attention of. The fried chicken was tragically overfried and $4 for a soda water is unbelievable. We live close by so we're hoping to make this a regular spot but the cost for the lackluster quality and service will be a deterrent.",

While I think it is on the pricy side I was there for a Christmas party so I didn't have to worry about paying :)   The service was very good. They came over several times throughout our meal and checked on us and made sure we were enjoying our experience. They also took our picture a couple of times when we asked which was nice of them.  I have to say I enjoyed their appetizers and small bites more than my actual meal. I would love to come back and try more of them because they were hard to choose from because they all looked so good!  We decided to start off with the hummus, mac and cheese and the dates. I have to say the dates were my favorite out of all three. They were served with red sauce which was a great pairing. The mac and cheese was great for splitting since it was very heavy. The hummus was good but my least favorite.  We then also decided to order the deviled eggs. OMG they were probably the best denied eggs I have ever have and they looked so pretty when they were served.  If I came back I would have to order the dates and the eggs again.  I then ordered the tomato basil soup. So good and creamy. It was also served with a tiny grilled cheese sandwich that was great for dipping.   I ordered a pasta dish but I don't recall the name. By that time I was pretty full and probably didn't need to order this. I took it home for my uncle to try.   I did, however, save room for dessert. We tried the Honey Olive Oil Cake and the Milk Chocolate Souffle. The souffle was just ok to me but I really enjoyed the olive oil cake. The olive oil made it very moist. It was served with blood orange sherbet. Which felt kind of odd as a pairing but still tasted good.  I enjoyed the dining experience. I will be back to try more apps and dessert.",

    "text": "Pizza and whiskey make this a must visit location. Hearthstone has many attributes. First among them is the pizza. Chef Enzo is a pizza master straight from Italy and specializes in Neapolitan style thin crust pizzas. They are amazing. The crust is well done with a hint of smokiness from the wood fired oven. Try the meatball pizza for a touch of salty protein goodness complimented by fresh cheese and tomato sauce. If you're feeling adventurous, ask for the pizza of the night. It's a special pizza creation which changes regularly.  All of the menu items are amazing. The lollipop chicken wings, prime rib, and pork shoulder are phenomenal. The meat and cheese board is great for sharing. The roasted jalapeno hummus makes for a wonderful non-meat snack.  I could eat here everyday.  While Hearthstone is light on beer and wine by the glass options, they shine with their whiskey selection. It's a showcase with Woodford, Elijah Craig, Sunntori, Crown XR, Red Breast and other whiskey favorites. I haven't seen a collection like this in quite some time.  The only real downside is that the restaurant is not usually busy. On the odd occasion when it is, the staff gets weeded very easily. Then it's hard to get service. The servers aren't used to high customer volume.",

We felt so uncomfortable we moved to a table. We tried the steak tar tar and popcorn. Both were mediocre at best so we decided to leave and go to yard house instead.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times for brunch and every time was excellent. But I am writing about our specific experience for dinner last night. After a long work week for both of us, my husband and I wanted an easy dinner with our 8 month old daughter. We decided on Hearthstone to have something a little different than our usual spots. We were seated right away, even though the restaurant was full and bustling. Our server Ahmed was attentive and friendly. We shared a DOC pizza which was as good as the best pizza places in town. Thin and gooey deliciousness! I had the apple and quinoa salad. Extremely filling, refreshing, and tasty. My husband was in the mood for a burger, but decided on Ahmed recommendation of the French dip. Amazing choice!!  With all of this and two beers the bill was $85 with tax and tip. We will definitely be going back soon. It is a fun, hip atmosphere with delicious food and excellent service. Who needs much more?",

    "text": "My wife and I wanted to try a new place for our anniversary. So Hearthstone was the spot.  Made 530 reservations, showed up at 5, no problem they sat us at a table.  Our Server was Rigo and he was fantastic. As were all of the servers that had any interaction with us during the meal. The service was the only reason there's 3 stars.  We started with the Bacon Wrapped Dates. There was nothing special or interesting about them. For $14 we were given 3 dates stuffed with chorizo, wrapped in a chunk of bacon, and set atop some red sauce that was too close to RAGU from a jar, to be called anything else. Literally $2.50 worth meat and produce sold for $14. My wife ordered the Burger $17 and added bacon $3. It was good, not great, bacon was top notch.So again, $20 for a burger??  Myself after seeing what $14 got me with the Dates I ordered the Froman pizza. $19 for 10\"-12\" of paper thin crust with about 8 slices of garlic sausage, and I could see more sauce than cheese.   I had 2 805 draft beers with dinner and they were spot on. Cold, clean and crisp, you could tell they were doing simple drink preparation right.   I get it, the build out for this place probably cost a fortune, and the rent Stations is charging is scary to say the least. At the same time $73 for a burger, a tiny pizza, a few pieces of fruit and a couple beers???   We could have spent $40 more and went to Echo and Rig and had a legit meal.   Oh and the desert special was sweet potato pie.. 2 days after thanksgiving. Just what people want, more sweet potatoes.   Won't say won't, but highly unlikely that we'll be back.",

Let's focus on the last time I was there though and the last time I ever plan on going here. We sat at the bar, it was like 1pm and we were starving. We ordered the crispy potato waffle - there's a HUGE difference between crispy and burnt. There was absolutely no flavor to it. It was dry and unappetizing. We sent it back. We also got their donut thingy and it was way too sweet plus by then our remaining tastebuds had committed suicide so didn't even finish that. Needless to say we don't plan on going back.",

Beverages like a fruit juice or iced tea is $4  The chicken and mushroom pizzas were good, but for the price and portion size (individual size) at $20+, you're better off going somewhere else.

I ordered the lobster roll - good, but was missing something. I couldn't help but compare it to Cousin's Maine Lobster food truck's lobster rolls, which are my favorite. I think the bread needed more butter or a sauce... I don't know, it was just missing something. But still good! I got the mac & cheese as a side, which was delicious - hot and gooey.  We had our young son with us, and there was plenty of space that allowed us to pull his stroller up beside our table. There were plenty of families with kids there - while I wouldn't say it's a \"good place for kids,\" they are definitely welcome.  I'll definitely be back, but probably won't order the lobster roll again.",

Two large pigs rotating on an open fire, fresh garlic being mixed in their specially blended sauce and hearing the skin break as the fire traveled deeper into the pig was enough for me to try this place out.  I got their pig wrap which was fresh pulled pork in a bed of their creamy garlic sauce and vegetables. Packed a lot of flavor and definitely was the food highlight for this years life is beautiful event.  Next its off to the restaurant to try what else they have and if it was like that pork wrap then i know i won't be disappointed.",

I don't mean that there's a section inside that leads to an outside patio. Literally half the restaurant is inside and the other half is outside. There isn't really any border. It's sick! The restaurant has such an amazing vibe, in and out.  Also, the staff is very friendly and very helpful. They are always coming back cleaning up as soon as you finish an appetizer or drink which is very convenient. They are really are quality staff. The only thing I'd warn anyone about this place is that the portions are a bit on the smaller side. I wasn't shocked, seeing that this restaurant is a bit on the pricier side. That's to be expected of a place like this, but all in all, this place rocks. Definitely a great date spot and/or higher end hang for a group of people.",

Fried egg on pizza??? So good.  - The only thing I do wish is that we sat in the outdoor area!!  - My family and I met the manager, awesome guy!

The wait for a table was one hour at 8:00 p.m., but there was open seating at the coffee table at the back, so we went for that.  I love the decor and ambiance. The feeling is like being at a very laid back wealthy person's suburban or country home. Not flashy, but luxurious while remaining casual.   The service was good but the food was just OK.  My friend and I each had a cocktail ($12 each, which is the going rate these days) and we split the hummus, meatballs, and stuffed dates.   The hummus was served with flatbread that I liked, but the dip itself was NOT good. The texture was oddly fluffy and the flavor was lacking. Not bad, just bland.   The short rib meatballs were OK. Not worth $12 for three mediocre meatballs, but not bad. Just not special or very good.   The stuffed dates were OK. I have had these at a lot of other places (Firefly and Cafe BaBa Reeba, among them) and I think that they were also overpriced and just OK.   Our tab, with the above was $60 before tip. I would go back for a drink and maybe to share different small plates but I am not in a hurry to go there again.",

    "text": "Hello, and welcome to Hearthstone Kitchen &Cellar. This was our first stop for restaurant week 2017. #helpoutdineout. We hit up 4 this year and I have reviewed them in reverse order. We had reservations through open table and arrived early. We were seated immediately and drink orders were taken. The first thing I noticed is how loud this place is. we were seated not far from the bar and close to a couple group tables. Hearthstone is a Clique Entertainment group facility they have Baracha and Botigla in GVR. We are a fan of their product so Hearthstone seemed like a natural choice. Plus it's in a local casino not on the strip which is a plus.  We received both the regular and the restaurant week menus and took a gander at both. We decided on restaurant week menu as it gave a great sampling and helps out local charity.  First course, Chef's Meat and Cheese Board and crispy calamari.. We also ordered a Cheesy bread off the Happy Hour menu. So, this is where the meal takes a left turn. I start to notice that other meals start to come out at the tables seated around us but after us. I stay silent (for a change) and just wait. Every time waitress comes by she says it should only be a few more minutes. The meat and cheese area where they make stuff is visible and we can see what is coming out. Not our stuff. The cheesy bread was good, but I am ready to order a second beer and on a 3rd water. Finally our Calamari comes out and the Meet & Cheese Board. I am on my 2nd bite of Calamari and my main dish shows up. More on the mains in a moment. I must have had a look of confusion on my face because the manager comes by and asks if all was okay. I stated that the timing of the kitchen is off because our apps and main dishes just arrived almost at same time. So something is going to get either warm or cold while I eat the other. She stated that she would talk to kitchen and take care of our drinks for the night and our apps. Since its restaurant week apps are part of the all inclusive, so that is not an option. However, drinks were taken care of and the one off menu item we had was deducted. Good recovery. we heard from others that this is an on going issue. Back to the food. Since it is a Clique facility we had High expectations. Was not disappointed. The apps were Calamari and Meat and Cheese board. Calamari was seasoned and cooked well just as it is at Botiglia. Meat and cheese board, Excellent slices of meat and fresh cheeses. They use Cabot Sharp cheddar which is one of my favorites. Has a nice sharp bite and is a white cheddar which as we all know the natural way to have cheese. Board also contained a couple different salamis and one other cheese, not positive what that was at this time.  Very soon after came our main dishes. I had the Prime Flat Iron Steak, Josie had Shrimp and Grits. Botigla once offered the flat iron but had removed it before I had the honor of trying it, so I was elated to find this on the restaurant week menu. Served with an earthy peppercorn sauce. Cooked medium rare as requested. Slicing through was like butter and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Served with a side of mashed potatoes that are really nondescript. Josie's shrimp and grits were equally enjoyable. Shrimp cooked perfectly and a slight spice added for taste and a good bite. Grits were pleasantly cooked and creamy. Overall, despite the timing of the two first courses the meal took shape flavor wise.  Desert,  we ordered the Nutella pizza. It's simple, Nutella on crisp pizza dough.If any one of the chefs are reading this; a nice banana or strawberry would go great on top of this. It was good and rich but needed a sweet fruit component added to the top. We stated that to the waitress and she added that many people have said the same thing. Maybe the customer is right.  Thank you for Dining at Hearthstone kitchen and Cellar. After a rough start they recovered well. I must add if you use the Yelp app there is a free glass of house wine. Our drinks and one app were all covered after the timing thing, so customer satisfaction is definitely paramount.  We will probably go again and try some different fare on the menu. We are fans of the Clique group so most likely will happen. If you are in Red Rock Station and want a good meal before or after a show or bowling the food is good and the beer is great and has some local stuff on tap.",

The food here was delicious. I've been craving good food since we came back from Chicago and the food at Hearthstone satisfied that craving like no other. I'll start by saying the atmosphere is perfect. I'm one to judge my experience by multiple things; decor/atmosphere being in my top three. Second service was on point. Our server Taylor joined in on our tipsy conversation about going to a Bieber concert just because \"the girlfriend wants to go\"  debate. He was super friendly and had good suggestions on the menu; which made it more difficulty to select something.  I really enjoyed my endless and free mimosa this Sunday. This will be a place I will come to weekly.",

Hearthstone seemed like it would hit the spot, and that it sure did.   My dad opted for the fried chicken with an apple slaw and biscuit while I went with the lobster roll with skinny fries, we shared the green beans which were cooked in bacon and topped with almonds and were legit the best green beans I've ever eaten, albeit probably the most fattening.   Fried chicken was delicious and moist. Huge serving with a biscuit that had melted cheese over the top. The apple slaw was also quite good, even to my father who proclaims his distaste for any type of cole slaw.  Lobster roll was buttery deliciousness with huge chunks of lobster perfectly coated with whatever their mayo mixture is. The whole thing was devoured. Fries were fries - good but everything else was great.   My dad got the strawberry margarita while I sipped on the endless refills of water. Drink was okay, I probably wasn't the best judge of drinks at that particular moment, I was alcoholed out.   Service was friendly and super fast as well as informative. Our waitress recommended the green beans to us and as I already expressed my love for them, she did not disappoint.   Seems to be a bit pricey for what you get however. $25 for friend chicken, $28 for a lobster roll (the lobster did taste very fresh and was cooked to perfection however). Not sure if this is due to being in the resort or not. I would recommend for hotel guests absolutely, locals however probably know where to find other quality food that isn't as highly priced.",

We ordered so much food for the table we had leftovers. Ive tried the Rotisserie Chicken, Fried calamari and Tuna Tartare all were amazing.

I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service was on point. I got the prime rib French dip and it was a bit on the salty side and the meat was like shredded which I wasn't expecting. The sandwich was ok. Will definitely be going back to try out the pizza and will update when I do that. FYI they do half off pizzas on Sundays :)",

It's well worth the trip.   When you first walk in there's this weird gallery wall that I'm not a huge fan of, but the rest of the decor throughout the restaurant, including the patio is very homey and well done. I wouldn't mind living there.   The service was great. We had a group of six people, two of which were kids and one baby. They accommodated us very well. Not to mention they had kid's menus. It's rare you go to a restaurant like this and they actually have a tangible paper kids menu (No doodling space though). I tried the deviled eggs and the beet and arugula salad. The deviled eggs were so fantastic. I wish I could replicate them. And the beet salad was very refreshing and light. Although, I do wish they put more than just 3 leaves of arugula on it and transformed it into more of an actual salad.   The kids loved their Mac & cheese, chicken tenders and grilled cheese and tomato soup. Also: honorable mention to our waitress who allowed us to convert the fancy adult Mac & cheese into a kids version even though it wasn't on the menu.   Check it out if you're ever in Summerlin, or not... Just check it out. Period.",

The food was not bad; 3 stars just because both the calamari and my prime rib was a bit on the super salty side. They were busy and I'm not much to complain; was probably one bad batch out of all the meals they do. The price point is also somewhat high for the atmosphere and the food. This dinner and cocktail for 2 cost me more than my visit to Joe's Stonecrab and steakhouse at Caesar's the prior week. However, I would still recommend it just because it is a good feel. I will probably try a brunch and happy hour next time.",

At the beginning of our dinner service service was a bit of a mess. Slow refills, staff that wasn't entirely informed on the menu and a hostess that was clearly hired for looks over substance.   As the evening progressed, the quality of the food more than made up for the lackluster service that started out our evening. Service became much more attentive once we were ushered indoors when it got a little gusty.   My favorites from the evening were the charred octopus, FG & J, steak tartare, crabby cakes and roast.   I look forward to utilizing that patio again soon for brunch before the weather gets too warm. Great meal overall. Full disclosure, we were not presented with a check at the end of the meal, but we tipped very generously.",

Our group ordered their cheese/meat plate last night, such a cool presentation (I don't eat meat so I had never seen this one before). Was a great appetizer for a big group.

    "text": "*****Update****** Sarah from Hearthstone contacted me and asked for an opportunity to make the poor experience up to us. On Saturday we decided to stop in and eat with a group of friends. When Sarah heard we were there she asked if she could possibly make it up to us by bringing us some complimentary appetizers. I told her it was completely up to her because we were now a party of 7 vs the party of 4 when the incident occurred and I did not want her to feel obligated to do so. Well let me tell you...................I think Sarah may have brought us close to every appetizer on the menu as well as multiple entrees off the menu in addition to what we ordered. Our server Jeff went above and beyond to make the experience absolutely amazing. When the bill came we were fully expecting to pay for the dinners we ordered and we were shocked to find out they had comped everything and even asked us if we had room for dessert! We were stuffed. Needless to say we tipped Jeff well and thanked everyone for their attentiveness and willingness to make up for the bad experience. Sarah and Jeff are amazing and Thank you for making things right.  Please go visit them and say Hey!!! We will certainly be back.   So this just happened!!!! 4 of us just went to  Hearthstone for the $10 bottomless chicken wings. Since I don't eat chicken I ordered a separate meal that was about $22 while the other 3 decided to get the wings. The waiter proceeds to tell us unless everyone at the table orders wings they can't honor the $10 bottomless wings for the other 3. I explained I don't eat chicken and if he could get the manager. The manager tells us sorry those are the rules and they can't accommodate. Are you kidding me? Since I didn't order the $10 bottomless wings and instead I'm going to order a meal that's 2x's the cost plus we all ordered drinks from the bar. You just lost a group of paying customers that would spend a minimum of $100 plus tip for a possible group of 4 that may spend only $40 plus tip. Dumb business practice. Oh and by the way there's no ****special restrictions listed on the promo.  We'll take our business somewhere else.",

It's incredibly cool with a rustic theme, the service was awesome - at the bar and the dining room, the drinks were enjoyable, and the food was delicious.  Happy Hour starts at 5pm and ends at 7pm, Mon-Sun. Can't beat that!! It was an incredible deal and certainly one that will keep me coming back to the restaurant.  The Pinot Noir on the happy hour menu is decently good and pairs well with the chicken wings on the happy hour menu. Finger licking good!!  The server suggested the Watermelon salad special: It was decently portioned out and had feta cheese, hazelnuts, avocado, thinly sliced red onion, and arugula. Amazing!!  We also ordered their DOC pizza, jalapeno hummus with a side of sesame lavash, and a dozen oysters.  For desert, we had the chocolate ice cream that surprisingly came with a warm home made chocolate chip cookie and their chocolate souffle which was absolutely worth the 20 min wait time.   Hearthstone has definitely lived up the hype! I'll be back again!!",

She made sure everything was special for all 6 of us. We named our pig 'Ham Solo' and what a surprise, when we were seated, and saw the Star Wars masks! Nice touch! The whole experience, especially for our out of town guests, was fantastic. The whole staff went above and beyond. A night we will always remember.   The food was superb! We started off with the meat and cheese tray and some specialty drinks, flower bomb, Hearthstone margarita and sangria. All delicious. Next, Ham Solo was rolled out on a cart and placed on our Star Wars themed table for the knife. The prep was something to watch and brought in a few of the surrounding table guests for picture ops. The energy of the room changed dramatically when our pig entered. And a team placed our plated pig and all the sides on our table for the feast. Then the chef personally came out and presented a special dish to our vegetarian  friend. We had friends from out of state and locals with us. It was so memorable. And Hearthstone just made some new friends for life.   There wasn't much of the suckling pig left after we tore into it. It was, by far, the best pork we have all ever had. Juicy, flavorful and the sides complemented the meat perfectly.  We all talked about it for hours after we were finished. That's how wonderful the whole experience was. We'll be talking about it for years to come and have already started planning our next one.   Thank you Hearthstone team. Each and every one of you! See you next time!",

The service is even decent especially at the bar inside, however the reason I'm only giving them 3 stars is because after all it is a restaurant, meaning a place the should be 90% judge on the food. And I must say that unfortunately it ain't all that. I've been here a few times now & had several of the items on the menu, most not so great. Sig drinks are somewhat average too. I did enjoy the nice size whole lobster meal they have for $24 despite the corn being over cooked. In the end it makes for a cool indoor/outdoor venue to stop by if you live in that general area, just not worth going too far out of your way. Still rooting for it to last tho!",

Last night, we had a group of 8 for a surprise party, and decided to give Hearthstone a try.  It was amazing from beginning to end.  Service - 10, Food - 10, Atmosphere - 10.  The food was great.  Everything that we tried...and we tried about half the menu, was outstanding.  Definitely recommend the burger and the beet salad, the french dip, and salmon.  Artichoke dip was great, as were the turkey meatballs, the bacon wrapped dates, and the lollipop wings.  Food was great.  Great selection of beers and drinks too.  But honestly, it was the service, and specifically Elisa, and the GM Russell, that made the evening a SMASH hit, for our [very] surprised guests.  From the moment we sat down, Elisa made us feel like we were the only guests she was taking care of.  She never missed a beat, and really felt like she was a part of our party.  I used to own a restaurant for 19 years, and I can tell you that it's rare to get this level of attention and service in a restaurant nowadays.  Elisa truly made our evening a hit.  She was fun and friendly, attentive and really on the ball.  She cared.  And it showed.  Her GM Russell was also very fun and helped create the perfect atmosphere for our party.  We will definitely go back and eat there again.  All around a great time, with great food.",

My husband and I were looking for a restaurant to have brunch so we stopped by Red Rock and saw this restaurant we asked to look at their brunch menu and the first dish that caught our attention was the chicken and waffle (only reason we entered) the server was nice and polite when we both ordered the chicken and waffle the server made a joke saying  I hope we don't mess it up. Even though I assume it was a joke it turned out to be True. When they brought out our orders my mouth watered at the sight of our chicken and waffle plates. Don't let your eyes deceive you. When I took a bite out of the fried chicken it had no taste. Super bland I had to ask for salt and every bite I took of that chicken I had to sprinkle a little bit of salt on it for taste. This chicken and waffle was not worth the $21 dollars we paid for each plate. It was super disappointed.",

    "text": "This is an update from my last review and visit. We were invited back as soon as my review was posted which is amazing response time. Since my schedule is so busy we didn't get to go until today.   I must say that they made such a great effort to make this experience a good one. The service was excellent, drinks were refilled and we were checked on more than the last time. We did notice that the menu is alot smaller, which they explained was due to seasonal menu changes and items. Some items were no longer offered, like the infamous \"crabby snacks\". Let's just hope I don't get harassed again by John M., whose girlfriend works there becuase I didn't give it a 10 stars. LOL. People need to relax, we're giving our opinion about the food and experience.  Thank you to Peter V., for inviting us back as it truly changed our perspective. Everyone was very hospitable and we were rendered excellent service.   We ordered:  Bakes ricotta and truffle honey-  this is a must order and always a winner! Steak Tartar with poached egg- Yes, this time it came (we ordered it on the last visit and it never came, lol). This was seasoned perfectly and just the right amount of pickles, the egg made this dish extra rich and delicious. Make sure to ask for extra toast. Meatballs- They were good, moist and tasty. The tart tomato sauce was a good compliment. Tomato Bisque- the bisque was tart and just a hint of sweetness. They served it with a cheese and salami sandwich to dip. Very good.   Main Entrees  Shrimp Pasta- This shrimp and pasta was topped with bread crumbs that gave it a great texture. The sauce was rich and pasta was cooked perfectly. Hanger Steak- Another great dish, cooked to temperature. We ordered rare. But the steak fries were a bit salty for our taste. Wild Salmon- Poached then oven baked, moist and delicious.  Hamburger- We order two and they both were cooked to temperature. These were really good, but the steak fries were a bit salty for our taste.",

Casen was my server; makes a mean Old Fashioned & knows his drinks very well, and I'm a tough judge on bartenders.  Food was fantastic across the board, and came out in less than 15 minutes. Not a bad word to say and highly recommended, especially considering we arrived 5 minutes AFTER the kitchen was meant to close and they still managed to squeeze the order in.",

    "text": "We were going to Red Rock Casino to see a show and wanted a place in the casino to have dinner. I looked over the Hearthstone menu and saw the entrees ranging from $20 for a flatbread up to $46 for filet mignon.  This seemed to be about the right level of restaurant for what we wanted for the evening. The ambience could be described as informal (see the photo). The room is quite large. There are large screen televisions everywhere playing various athletic events. Tables without tablecloths. There is an open kitchen on the left as you walk in. And there is a very large bar towards the rear. The music is loud but not obnoxious. Overall, it has the feel of an upscale Gastro pub crossed with a sports bar. The service was really outstanding. Jesus, our server, came to the table almost immediately to take our drink orders and to explain the menu and the specials. Very friendly, making us feel welcome. During the meal, our water glasses never got even half empty before he was there to refill them. The pace of the service was just about right. A very nice touch was when the chef brought out our steak to show us what it looked like before they sliced it.  We ordered a chickpea salad to share. It was very good, not great. My wife got the meatball flatbread to share with her friend. This turned out to be a very thin crust 12 inch pizza with very flavorful ricotta cheese and somewhat spicy meatballs. The flavor was excellent. However, at $23 for a 12 inch pizza, it was a bit pricey for what you got. My buddy and I decided to share the special porterhouse steak. It was a huge steak. It was served with a small amount of potatoes on the side. The steak was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. The potatoes are also quite tasty. My big gripe however was that the steak cost $120. I almost fell off my chair when I got the check. I had figured that with the filet mignon costing $46, the shareable porterhouse would be in the range of $60 or $70.  I never would have guessed that in an informal Gastro pub type restaurant that a steak would cost anywhere close to that price. Clearly this was my bad for not asking before ordering. And it was quite good in terms of the taste. Just not $120 worth of good. Overall, ambiance, service, and food were all five star. However, when you consider value for the dollar spent, this was not a 5 star dining experience.",

With the intention of keeping it simple and fun it was the perfect set up to keep everyone happy. The kids all made their own personal pizzas and they let us bring a cotton candy machine. They played shuffle board and had a scavenger hunt in the hotel. And we adults had the luxury of partying in of the greatest spots in Summerlin. The seafood platter was perfect! Everything we are was! Chef Brian and his team went above and beyond for us.  If you are looking for the roe of party where it's easy fun and just on point this is a great idea.

I recommend sitting inside for preferably better attentiveness. Their weekly deals are really great like their 10$ lollipop chicken weeks all you can eat on chicken wing day. Their drinks were really really good and strong. I definitely want to try their cheese and meat plates sometime when I get to it. I was also not please for being charged $4 for club soda....

Comparing a pizza to a main course meal was actually hilarious. Their pizza is out of this world. Their service staff and outdoor patio is like no other, we had a blast. Great service and great vibes on a hot Vegas night.",

Very fresh oysters and come with all the compliments to go along with them.   If you are going any other day, or don't like oysters, I recommend the burger, which has to be one of the best burgers I have had ( it better be for 20 ). Also I highly recommend the lobster roll. It is very light creamy and flavorful.",

    "text": "Well I've been to this establishment a few times for the wine club but haven't eaten there before. So we decided after the wine club event we'd have dinner. Our server was nice although it was so loud we could barely hear anything not even each other. Maybe it was bc if the wine club lol. Nice outdoor seating but I along with other ppl who I heard asking-really wish you would put servers out  on the patio. It was nice outside perfect breeze before the 118 degree weather kicks in. Anyway we got sat right in the middle where ppl kept walking behind me and bumping into me which was frustrating but oh well now I know to ask for a different area to sit in. On to the food: I checked in via yelp so we got the free jalapeno hummus appetizer ($9) it was good but omg the pita it came with- it was SO hard we couldn't even eat it. I had to ask the server for bread I'm telling you that someone WILL break their teeth on those things yikes! No can do- I love my teeth,Sorry. But the hummus was delish; first time trying that Jalapeno hummus flavor. We both ordered the fried chicken meal and Sub'd the slaw for mashed potatoes instead. I should have read but it was tiny print and so dark that it came with some type of sweet honey syrup glaze on the chicken. I was hoping for a salty crispy chicken taste but it was soft skin & sweet. I will ask for it without the sweet glaze next time. The jalapeno biscuit was good just tried a small piece and we brought the rest home to go. Someone is getting a nice lunch tomorrow lol. Good size portion for the price ($22). I'd go again maybe for All U can eat Wings on Monday if they still do that. Still iso some good crispy flat wings here in Vegas! Had to give it one less star bc I thought I was gona lose a tooth with the hummus crisps otherwise it was a decent meal. I'd go back.",

First of all they bring out the pre-mixed version and it was full of orange juice. When we asked the server for a bottle and for us to make the rest he refused. That made no sense since it was supposed to be bottomless anyway. But he actually did us a favor because it was the cheapest champagne ever and we all got headaches afterwards.  Other than that the food was average nothing fancy.  We won't be coming back here for brunch...",

They have some tv so you can catch the games and they have a pool table and shuffle board in the corner. For the main dish I had fish and also tried the lobster roll which was money and my friend had the fried chicken which was good as well.

They accommodated our large group by putting together two big tables which was great. The server was nice and gave us good service. I gave this place a 3 star because a lot of us felt the prices were overpriced for the portion size and quality of food and being it's not even a fine dining setting. $17 for a burger is a bit overpriced and it was very small and the patty inside was so thin and tasted like it wasn't freshly made and tasted like it was a frozen patty. I don't eat burgers all the time and this was my first time eating a burger in a while and so I was sadly disappointed. My friend also had  the burger and felt the same way. She won't be ordering the burger again there also. We also felt we won't be going back there again.",

    "text": "Well, mixed updated review from my sunday brunch visit today at 11 am with 5 friends.  Our server saved the day...  The Bad:  We had a 11 am reservation and the hostess seated us at the high top table inside right next to the bar.  A server from the bar asked who was doing bottomless mimosas and got us started with a glass. All good then for 20 minutes, not one server stopped by the table.    Finally after trying to wave someone down, our awesome server stopped by..on to the good part..  The good: I didn't get his name but our server was a bald gentleman who was awesome.  He observed that no one was assisting us and took the initiative to take care of us.  He apologized for the wait, he didn't know what happened but he was going to take care of us the rest of the way.  He did a great job, he brought 2 carafes to the table and they were never empty.   All the orders came out correctly and quickly.  The Summary: My food was great, I had the loco moco this visit and I loved the chicken fried rice that was used vs white rice regularly.  Maybe we caught the staff on a bad day.  However, it was early so the restaurant was only at about 20% capacity which makes this even more mind boggling.  I hope the service is better on the next visit as I love the food here, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

Sadly I only took a pic of my main course but the appetizers were great. I'm a big octopus fan and it was good. But we had the honey ricotta appetizer which was delicious. Normally not something I would order but our server,Melissa, recommended it and it was excellent!!!  Split the seafood platter for dinner and it was very fresh and amazing!! Enjoyed the entire ambiance. Our poor server,Melissa, kept apologizing for the table next to us, who might of had too much to drink and were getting a little heated. But we found them entertaining and not too obnoxious that it ruined our night. Highly recommend this location and Melissa!",

    "text": "I was excited to see that Hearthstone's had hanger steak on the menu, it's tender like a filet but because it's more marbled has a great beef flavor.  I ordered the hanger steak for $34 and it came with fries and truffle aioli (which tasted more of vinegar than garlic so I think it was mayo with truffles).  Unfortunately the steak I received was the toughest meat I have ever tried to eat.  I didn't finish my steak, not because I was full but because I was so tired of chewing.  Maybe they confused flank steak (a flavorful but tough inexpensive cut of meat) with hanger steak.   I've eaten at Hearthstone's several times and the food was fine.  Not great but not bad, expensive for what it was but that's the nature of casino restaurants.  But this time the steak was so disappointing I don't think I'll be back for a while.",

    "text": "Generally, I prefer to write reviews after experiencing a business at least twice; this review is being written after my third visit. My overall rating likely would have been closer to a 4, but the recent addition of multiple vegan options to the regular menu definitely increased my impression of Hearthstone.  My first visit was solely for drinks at the bar. It was busy that night, and service left a bit to be desired. Our bartender was great, but a female bartender I asked to bring the check was incredibly rude for absolutely no reason. I'm glad I didn't base that experience on whether or not to return, because I probably wouldn't have, and I would have missed out on the typical experience I have since come to really enjoy.   Visits two & three were for happy hour drinks and food in the lounge. There are several very  comfortable couches bordering the area between indoor and outdoor seating. The ambiance is relaxed with a great vibe. I also have had incredible service the two times we've sat in this awesome area.   Being a vegan who requires gluten free due to celiac disease, I really appreciate being able to enjoy an Omission Lager and Vegan Slider with lettuce wrap. Although I'm not 100% certain, I'm pretty sure the patty used for the vegan slider is the Beyond  Burger, which is super awesome since that burger is quite realistic and super flavorful. The vegan quinoa mayo also is phenomenal--way to go Chef! I also was super stoked that there is now a vegan section included on the regular menu. Clearly Hearthstone is receptive to suggestions and feedback from their guests. A big THANK YOU from me and the entire vegan community!  Another awesome perk is the free Jalapeno hummus with Yelp check in. Although the lavosh typically served with the hummus is not gluten free, our server was more than accommodating and offered vegetable crudites as a complimentary substitute. He also brought lavosh for my BF since he's not GF. For a free appetizer, I really felt the service was exceptional.   All in all, my BF and I really enjoy coming to Hearthstone and will continue to return and enjoy the great service; yummy cuisine; and comfortable, chic ambiance.",

    "text": "Hearthstone served my favorite meal in Vegas a couple weeks ago. We decided to stay at the Red Rock resort instead of heading down to the strip on our night off, and it ended up being a wonderful decision. We had the choice to sit inside or outside, and decided not to risk being chills and stayed inside.  Of course we started with drinks. I had a delicious old-fashioned that was super sweet and brought a big smile to my face.  My friend got the prime rib and loved every bite that she could finish. She also said she loved eating her fabulously smooth potatoes with a spoon.   Although I've lived 'up north' my whole life, I decided to go with something far from regular Michigan cuisine - shrimp and grits. So, so yummy. As a side, I got the broccoli. Seriously, if healthy tasted that good all the time, my whole life might change.  The decor and atmosphere was also cute and quaint. I can imagine enjoying any meal there, as it was like sitting in someone's cozy kitchen. I'd love to go back on another trip to Vegas.",

They were tender and moist, ricotta with truffle honey was sooo good it was served with toast. The rotisserie Porchetta was mehhhhh it was the chef special of the day recommended by our waitress... I would give it 2 stars not super horrible but nothing good about it.  Shrimp pasta was good. The chocolate souffle with ice cream and chocolate cookie was a great, Brussel sprout Cesar salad didn't have much flavor . Apple quinoa salad was yummy and refreshing.

In regards to the service, the waiter was not very helpful in menu selections. The appetizers we ordered were forgotten about with the waiter stopping by to ask, \"did the appetizers come out yet?\" The food items ordered, pizza.... the worst I've ever had (ABE Froman). The crust was soggy and burnt on the bottom (made no sense). My daughter ordered the pizza from the kids menu and received a regular menu pizza. The fries we ordered came out on a plate that was hotter than the fries and not freshly made but tasted as if sitting under a heat lamp.   I was very appalled, to say the least. I was not impressed and will not be revisiting this restaurant for a second meal that falls so short of the glory the other reviews and ratings give it. I chose Hearthstone Kitchen Cellar over Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and was hugely disappointed as I spent a great deal more at Hearthstone than I have at Mesa Grill, Hell's Kitchen, Giada's, Masso, etc. What a waste.",

When we were seated, we waited 20 minutes to get menus. No one ever took our drink Order. I had to ask for lemons 3x. My GF got bottomless mimosas. She has two half glasses before we almost finished our meal. While we were finishing up, they finally brought her a canister.   The table had the Loco moco, eggs Benedict , burger, shrimp cocktail, sticky bun, kids pizza and croissant sandwich. They brought the pizza out for our daughter to make it herself which was very cool. The sad part is they came to take it to cook while we all were getting our food to eat. He pizza finally came out 10 minutes later. The sticky bun was the best. Too bad it came out when we were almost done with our meal.",

    "text": "We met some friends at Hearthstone for dinner. They are located in the Red Rock near Yard Bird. We went on the weekend so the \"see and be seen crowd\" was there, which made for some pretty interesting people watching. I must say that I didn't care for the restaurant. First, it is extremely loud, headache-inducing loud. Now, I expect a popular place to have some noise but when you can't hear what your dinner companions are saying, that's a problem.  On to dinner. We had the Charcuterie variety to start, which was a variety of meats and cheeses with toasted bread on the side, $15.00. It was a large portion, enough to feed a party of 4. The guys had halibut with risotto, shortribs and I had the fried chicken. Portions are very generous, but Hearthstone is pricey. Four entrees an appetizer and 2 beers ran up a tab of over $200.00. And while the restaurant was nice, the servers were attentive and polished and everyone else enjoyed their dinners, I've had better for a whole lot less money.  Here's my tip, AVOID the fried chicken. Heaven knows that they give you enough of it, the server brought out a steaming plate of 1/2 a chicken, which could easily have served 3 people. So why am I griping? There is a trend in restaurants nowadays to bake chicken until it is 3/4 cooked, cool it, bread it and fry it. I am fully aware of why they do this, it takes a long time to fry chicken and they need to turn tables. But if you aren't going to cook it correctly, don't offer it.  This monstrous hybrid was coated in a 1/4 inch thick layer of breading that was as hard as a rock. Worst, when you actually removed the breading, the chicken wasn't seasoned and was rubbery! Here's a tip. Brine it in buttermilk before you bake it and it will be more tender!  Anyhow, the rest of my party had a good time, when/if you go just be prepared to pay a lot, hear a lot of noise, and avoid the chicken!",

Met another family today for the Labor Day Weekend complimentary mimosas and had the BEST food ever!  I was expecting to argue or beg for the mimosas instead our server Nathan just kept it flowing.  It wasn't just about the mimosas, it was management and the wonderful service that just kept checking to see if everything was fabulous.  I am the BIGGEST fan of Hearthstone, this place never disappoints.  Whether you are with the fam, or with a girls night or just Sunday football, this is the jam.  Nathan our server was fantastic, smiled with our 3 kids being bratty, kept the adults happy :-)  I hope this place stays open, most of the Red Rock restaurants close after 2-3 years, can't wait for fall ball and outdoor good times there!!!!!",

We came after the Sunday brunch rush & sat at the bar. The place was a mess, as you could tell it had been packed for brunch. There were plenty of employees bustling around us getting the place back in order.   Same thing was going on with the bartenders. While I understand you have to catch up on glassware and prep work; your most important task is to FOCUS ON YOUR GUESTS. The bartenders were obviously over being there for the day, and that was felt by us on the other side of the bar. We tried having conversation with them and they were pretty cold, not that I expect you to entertain me and be my BFF, but you could at least act like I'm not burdening you by chatting with you. And when someone gives you a compliment, it's polite to say \"thank you\".   I was impressed by the food, it was very flavorful & nice portion sizes. The ambiance was nice and the place is decorated well.   Then as we got closer to shift change, service went from cold and mediocre; to nonexistent. It was obvious they were ready for us to leave & we obliged. I just was disappointed given how much everyone talks this place up. Might come back, or maybe I'll just stick to DW.",

    "text": "We were excited to finally try this restaurant. We got there at happy hour and there were happy hour menus but when we requested them we were told by our server that he didn't have any to provide us with at the moment but he listed them off to us. Is this a method to get you in the door and then discourage Happy hour menu items orders? We ordered a dozen oysters to start along with two happy hour items and two off happy hour appetizers, shots and drinks. We also ordered our main dishes. I had to ask the server if they had specials - turns out they did - I've never before had to pry it out of a server. We ended up ordering the specials as well as steak and a child's menu item.?First out were the oysters. Oysters were small but ok but they were served with one tiny slice of lemon (like how you would find on the side of a glass) and a small container of cocktail sauce with weak horseradish sauce topped on top of the cocktail sauce. Presentation could have been much better.. We saw the table next to us order the small seafood plate and we were glad we didn't order it. It was small with only a few pieces of seafood for the price. We got one of our happy hour items and then our meals came. They completely forgot our other 3 appetizers. The main dishes including the specials were ok nothing special. When we told our server that our appetizers had been lost in the wind he apologized, gave some nonsensical reasoning and then brought us out two complementary desserts neither of which we would have ordered anyway.  In the end we were really disappointed. We love to enjoy ourselves at Red Rock and that includes spending many dollars at the restaurants there. Hopefully the resort finds a more exciting option than what is being offered now which is simply mediocre in every aspect except possibly the decor.",

Instead, there were loud TVs on, and terrible loud music playing. It felt like it was a sports bar, and the decor and atmosphere did not match. The food was bland. The quinoa salad was good, but the pizza and steak were flavorless. Would not go back.",

You'll have to try the truffle popcorn when you visit, as we went back for seconds and thirds.  My favorite dish was the watermelon salad.  It's done other places, but done exceptionally well here.  Add avocado, feta, some greens, a mint vinaigrette, and it makes it super delicious.    I had the petite filet (not my normal selection), and it was superb.  Really well prepared.",

    "text": "The service was good. Staff was attentive and ensured we were taken care of. The reason for the two star rating is because at the price points of the food, it should have been much better. My wife and I ordered the calamari and bacon wrapped dates for starters. The dates were only ok. They were stuffed with chorizo but the chorizo didn't really add anything other than filling and texture, there wasn't much flavor to it. The calamari was fine and the dipping sauces were good but other restraints serve equally as appetizing calamari at a lesser price. My wife ordered the scallops and she loved them, so that was a plus. I ordered the fried chicken. Just like the dates, the chicken was less than inspiring. Very little flavor and it was not hot and on the dry side. I felt as if it had been sitting for a while. The slaw was the best part of the dish as I did enjoy that. Again, for the price of the meal, I had higher expectations. There are plenty of soul food places in town where I can get tastier, juicier, and hotter fried chicken for a third of the price.  I wouldn't say that the place is awful, but in Vegas, there are way too many options to spend the amount of money we did to walk away feeling only ok about your meal.",

To start things off our waitress told us she didn't know that ham was pork lol & wasn't sure if the beef short rib meat balls were pork or beef. . Reviews read that portions are on the small side & priced a bit high.  I think it's True, but well executed. Only downfall was we found a huge chunk of white plastic in our mushroom pizza.. Didn't stop me from finishing it though. The situation was handled professionally and we were offered dessert and the pizza was on the house.

Kale salad was Caesars but a pretty poor version. $21 cheeseburger - nothing special. Grilled calamari was terrible. I didn't eat it. It soaked in some heavy sauce. Why bother grill it if it's going to be drenched. After eating it, it was also pretty clear there was no value at all, except that it's close to my house. Told manager who tried to make it right. Regardless, not worth trying again for us. Maybe you'll have better luck.",

The atmosphere was fun and lively. We tend to share things when we eat, so decided to order a bunch of appetizers instead of individual entrees so we could taste more of the items. The portions were very large and food came out quick.  We got the: Grilled octopus: amazing! Super tender with the perfect amount of char.  Tuna tartar: not your typical tuna tartar. Was more on the brighter citrus side (but not too citrusy) with pieces of watermelon. Really random but it worked and was really refreshing to eat. My boyfriend is not a fan of anything citrus or tuna tartar but he seems to really like this one.  Charcuterie board (2 cheese and 2 meats): standard. But they have you a lot of meat which I liked and appreciatedt  Ahi salad: good. Standard. But hey had these little tangy sweet peppers the size of a chickpea, that I was obsesseds with.   Steak tartar: by the time we got this we were stuffed, but it was really good. Not sure what was in it but there was a creamy ingredient that pulled it all together and made it so delicious. I'm usually picky with steak tartar but really enjoyed this  Highly recommend this restaurant and would go back if around the area.",

Two of us ordered call vodka and we're informed it wasn't on the happy hour menu, which we were fine with.  This showed that the waiter understood our interest in the special menu.   Imagine our surprise when we get our bill and most everything on it was priced for the regular menu. When questioned the waiter explained how everything we had was either larger or better from regular menu!  Even the wine was not happy hour.  He knew exactly what he was doing and tried to Upsell everything thinking we wouldn't notice.  We complained, waited forever for the teenage \"manager\" to attempt to fix it but were late for a movie. Finally got appetizers adjusted but she \"forgot\" the wine.    The whole thing seemed to me like recent Wells Fargo situation.  Low lever employees are pushed to do things to improve the bottom line at the expense of the customer.  Never going back.",

    "text": "We had a pretty disappointing experience here for Sunday Brunch. They got us through the door with free bottomless mimosas, but I personally didn't think they were very good.  First the good: +You can enter the restaurant from the outside and don't have to go through the casino. +The food was pretty yummy. +The people that were there were generally having a good time.  Now the bad: -We didn't make reservations, that's our bad. The restaurant was full when we first arrived, so we made reservations and left for an hour. The problem with bottomless mimosas is that people tend to sit around drinking them for hours. We would have preferred to sit outside, but when we got back an hour later, all the outside tables were still full with all the same people that were there when we left. -Very small portions for the food, which is overpriced. I paid $16 for eggs benedict, which was very tasty, and had a side of potatoes which were also very tasty, but the plate was basically less than half full. And they tried to charge me $21 for it (more on this later) -When we sat down, we got two different menus. It looked like they had old menus mixed in with new menus, and 2 of us got the old one and 2 of us got the new one. This is why I got charged $21 for half a plate of Eggs Benedict instead of $16. They apparently increased their prices even MORE on the new menu, but forgot to pull their old menu out of circulation, so a few of our prices were not rang up correctly. They did get it fixed for us, but it was frustrating. -My Fiancee ordered an omelette that was supposed to have broccoli, spinach, and cheese. She received it and the only thing inside of it was broccoli. She asked the waitress if it was missing something and the waitress immediately said \"we'll make you a new one.\" When her omelette came back, it was the same exact thing - only broccoli. We gave up after that. -Service was SLOWWWW. I mean, I get it. They were busy. But they were also very understaffed. We waited about 45 minutes for our food, and then when we wanted to pay and get out of there we waited almost 15 minutes for someone to come and take our payment. That means our entire dining experience was over 2 hours not including the hour that we left to come back. If we had known brunch was gonna take that long, we would have gone somewhere else. We won't be going back.",

To start, we had no idea who our server was because we went through four different waiters throughout the night, not including the bus boys. Further, one bus boy accidentally put water in one of our parties' drink. He only gave her an excuse and failed to ask her to replace it. Additionally, we had to ask for water on our first glass 3 times (from three different waiters) and lastly one server spilled water all over the table and a wallet, however, it was not acknowledged and not cleaned up. To top it all off, the ants and cockroaches weren't the most appealing. This place only deserved two stars because of the music.",

Unfortunately, it would have had been a perfect night for my husbands birthday if it wasn't for the waitress awful service. When I asked her for a red wine she automatically says that they don't have red wines. Really??? she didn't even know the menus or how to help us with the menus. That is unacceptable!  The food was good and the place is nice. The other servers were very nice. more professional waiters and this place would be a 4 star.",

    "text": "Tried this place for Sunday brunch and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. They have a nice indoor/outdoor space and the weather was perfect so we got a table on the beautiful patio. It's nice that Red Rock has more outdoor dining options now. We had the PBFJ appetizer - it was light, but the peanuts unfortunately overpowered the fois gras flavor. We also shared the crab cake benedict, which was great. The crab cake didn't have a lot of filler and served as the \"muffin\" on the bottom of a traditional benedict. We topped it off with the French toast, which was a little disappointing. It was way too sweet and didn't taste at all like salted caramel - mostly berries and frosting. We will probably return and try some other items on the menu but maybe not for a little while because it was also quite pricey.",

    "text": "This is my second review because I've tried many many more dishes! My favorite thing by far was the baked ricotta wow it was really amazing. Especially with the honey on top! Great flavors and even the toast that came with it was good.   The short rib meat balls were very tasty. The steak tartar with the poached egg was really great but I actually wish the toast that came with it didn't have truffle. Usually I love truffle but I think it overpowered the tartar a bit and was hard to finish it all with that. Next time I'll ask for plain toast I think! The lollipop wings were cooked perfectly nice and crispy but I actually think the buffalo sauce was too thick and tasted too ordinary (like something from a much cheaper place) to be on such a good cut of wings. We had the bacon wrapped dates because they said they had an extra and gave it to is (very sweet of them) and it was good for what it was but I wouldn't have ordered it because I'm not crazy about bacon and dates are a bit too thick and sweet for me. I had the shrimp pasta since multiple waiters had recommended it and I was surprisingly not loving it! I can't put my finger on what it was but it just did not \"wow\" me but the shrimp was good quality. We also had the truffle hanger steak which was good but not incredible.   For desserts I have had the chocolate chip souffle and the peanut butter lava cake. The souffle is definitely good but not amazing enough for me to actively crave it. The peanut butter cake was good as well but again not perfect. It comes with some sort of butterscotch (pudding I think?) which I actually think did not go with it very well. It actually interfered with the peanut butter flavor and sort of overpowered it all with it's sweetness and butterscotch flavor. I'd say something similar for the roasted banana ice cream. If it was just banana ice cream that would have worked better because the roasted ness made it much sweeter (like more saccharine) and didn't pair as well with the already really sweet cake.  Once I pushed it all aside, the cake itself is really good well made and good flavor.   Overall I am leaving my rating at 4 stars because although I enjoy many things here I am not obsessed with enough dishes for how expensive everything is. The price mostly reflects the quality but some of the flavors on each dish could be tweaked to \"wow\" me more and really deserve my money because some dishes were a bit unbalanced with it's flavors. I'm sure I will be back though!",

    "text": "I can understand why Hearthstone gets the mixed reviews that it does. A few friends and I had dinner reservations at 6:30 on a Sunday. Coming up to the hostess podium, I could see that there was not much action going on in the dining room. I was early, went to the bar and grabbed a drink. The specialty cocktails are on the sweeter side. The service is was nice. The back area is pretty sweet. With two shuffleboard tables and a comfortable sitting arrangement, it could definitely be a place to chill with your friends, grab a few drinks and light bites.  It caught me a little off guard was when the hostess came to find me at the bar and asked if I wanted to cancel my reservation. I told her that I was just waiting for my party and they should be here soon. It was only 6:20. I was informed that if I wanted to be sat, I could without them, otherwise they would be giving away my table. Okay... I will be sat then. Good thing another friend had shown up and we began to order. Apparently the chef's special meat and cheese board sometimes does not include a cheese. That was when we went about customizing our own board. Sadly, the pickles were probably the best item we got on the board. When I think about charcuterie boards, I think about a small variety of different items to sample. Especially if there is an option for the chef to highlight his best items of the day. The oysters were decent. Nothing spectacular. The foie gras with strawberry jam was fantastic. I could eat that all day. I ended up scrapping the container clean. The harvest quinoa salad was a nice balance of texture and flavors. The charred octopus was tender and a hit. When it was the time for mains, we were all getting full. Instead of doing multiple entrees, we just did their special 40oz tomahawk ribeye. This was probably the worst part of our meal. I was shocked when it came out 20 minutes after we ordered. Yes, we asked for medium rare, but that would have been a record in cooking time. No sear or car on the outside. I cut into it near the center and sure enough it was raw. We sent it back and it came out medium well. Oh, well. You can't win them all. We did however get the lobster polenta and the roasted squash with burrata. Both side dishes outshone the steak itself.   We left stuffed. I just wasn't sure if I would order some of these items again. I definitely liked Hearthstone enough to go back again. Maybe just for casual nibbles and some drinks.",

She was very pleasant and we were so happy to be able to enjoy a dinner on the usual busy Saturday evening.   Once sat we weren't able to decide what to get. Being our first time there we asked our server BRADY what he would suggest. For myself he suggested the lobster roll, which was absolutely delicious and for my boyfriend the hanger steak. Both selections were stunning and Brady's suggestions were greatly appreciated.   The staff was very attentive and friendly. Our server was OUTSTANDING, the best service I've EVER received in a restaurant. We will ask for Brady again when we come back in and you should too. You are surely in good hands.   p.s. get the oysters!!!!",

We always try to get Kate as our server. She is legit the best! When we don't have her, sadly, service is AWFUL! I am a waitress myself and have a lot of patience; but it is bad if we have anyone else. The greet takes forever, drinks take forever, and the food takes even longer. The GM is usually the one to take our drink orders because she sees us waiting. Kate always makes sure to get us our mimosas right away, even when it is busy. And she always refills my glass for me even though we have a picture on our table.  The unlimited mimosas are a steal and the food is bomb. I absolutely love the California Benedict! So good and way healthier than a normal Benedict. Also, the lox and bagel are so good and fresh. Also, I like getting a side of the turkey sausage. #yum!  I want to check it out for dinner one day, but I always forget. Maybe on a Wednesday so that we get $1 oysters.   But if you are going, ask for Kate as your server. She's beautiful and funny and amazing.",

The main dishes (French dip and burger) were just ok. The French dip was mushy, a bit bland, and came out slightly cold. The side of mashers were also bleh, too runny in my opinion and didn't have much flavor. Ordered the pineapple cake for dessert and was ok. The best tasting item was the specialty ice cream that came with the pineapple cake. Overall I felt like this restaurant couldn't decide what it wanted to be, upscale or casual, but definitely charges the upscale price for mediocre food. When you live in Vegas there are far better tasting options!",

Then my one son ordered the build your own pizza, which he was excited to do. They  brought out the made dough with the pizza sauce on top, a side of cheese and pepperoni. That's it. No other toppings. That's not really building your own pizza at all. We were disappointed.  My wife ordered the Hanker steak( which was fantastic) and I ordered the fried chicken. As I was eating the chicken we noticed that it seemed undercooked and were a little concerned. We talked to the waiter and he said he'd speak to the chef. Then the service stop. No refills, no stopping by and seeing if everything is ok. We had to flag the waiter down to order dessert. We finished the rest of the meal and then 2 new pieces of chicken came back. Lol.. We were done at that time and asked to just have it boxed up. Are desserts came and we sat there for 5 more minutes starring at them because they didn't bring silverware and we could not get anyone's attention. The other funny part is, my 2 kids wanted build your own sundae's. So we ordered 2 of them along with the peanut butter lava cake and the chocolate souffle. The build your own sundae had the ice cream with chocolate chips inside and chocolate syrup on the side. That's it. Pouring syrup on the sundae was build your own sundae. Are you kidding. We didn't complain and waited for the check. It came to 171 and change and I left $40 dollar tip. My wife said I shouldn't but I work for tips and it's hard for me not to. But as the days go by I become more upset at my experience. Just so I'm up front. It was on Valentine's Day at 5:30pm. You would expect it to be busy because of the special occasion. It wasn't. At all. It was pretty slow in my experience. It didn't start picking up to around 6:45. There was a ton of empty tables.  Thanks Steve R",

The restaurant is very attractive with an outdoor patio and a spacious and modern decor. The menu is almost overwhelming with great sounding descriptions of all the food available. The place was on the busy side and our server checked back with us frequently during the meal. However she came across as a little curt most of the time. We ordered chicken and waffles and a pimento cheese cheese burger. The waffles cut into pieces  to create a top and bottom bun were not whole wheat as described by our server. The chicken had a crispy coating with an acceptable flavor but oddly enough the bottom of the chicken had no such coating. The burger was another story though. There was not pimento cheese on the burger. There was a light sauce on the bottom bun with supposedly pimento cheese in it. We requested a substitute item which they did give to us. We tried the adult grilled cheese which was delicious with bacon and jam on it.  The bill had a good surprise as the higher priced entree was taken off not the lesser priced one. The grilled cheese was worth going there for but I am so so about the rest of the menu.#yelpcincinnati",

We shared everything (two of us) - had the chick pea salad, tartar toast, ricotta toast and shrimp cocktail.  Every. Single. Thing. Was. Delicious.  And I mean it was really good!  Going back soon to do this again, didn't realize we could make our own little taste testing right at the bar.  Great service, very clean, friendly and nice people work here.  ***UPDATE:  We keep going back!  Had happy hour pizza and have now tried the entire happy hour menu at the bar.  AWESOME FOOD!",

    "text": "I wasn't very impressed with this place. It looks beautiful but that's where my praise ends. I went with a group for super bowl Sunday.  Unfortunately, they decided to do a pre set menu with very limited options.  They had an option of AYCE for $35 per person but your entire group had to do that which was kinda ridiculous.  The options I can remember for food were buffalo wings,  meatball sub,  cheese burger,  french dip,  buffalo chicken sandwich,  pepperoni pizza, fried mac and cheese bites and a truffle popcorn.  They also had a seasoned popcorn for free.    The seasoned popcorn they put out was so salty we couldn't eat it.  I asked for a bowl of plain popcorn which was much better. I also tried the mac and cheese bites and pizza.  The only reason we finished the pizza is because i was starving.  It was thin crust but had a soggy texture. For $21 I was really expecting a good quality pizza not some frozen mess.  The mac and cheese bites were flavorless,  we didn't even finish them.   Shortly after I regrettably ordered my pizza the waitress came and told us that they would be opening the full menu shortly.  Wait,  what? You told us earlier that this was the only food options and they couldn't be modified because they were prepared that morning. They told my friend she couldn't change the cheese on the burger because of this.  I'm not sure if it was mixed in the burger or if the waitress was just not properly informed. We received mixed answers for different questions depending on so we asked which was quite frustrating.    The place had a great atmosphere but the service and food left much to be desired which is why I probably won't return.",

Sarah the manager was superb, she welcomed my party at short notice and made us feel so welcome. She really went the extra mile!    Jose, our server was impeccable. His knowledge of the menu and his expertise in being able to match my parties taste preferences with dishes on the menu was second to none.   We ended up ordering a variety of appetizers. Lollipop wings, baked ricotta (amazing) steak tar tar (the best steak tar tar I've ever eaten by far) soft shell crab, tuna tar tar and truffle chicken pizza. We then had 3 various desserts between the 6 of us and the peanut butter lava cake is to die for!   All in all you HAVE to visit this restaurant, amazing staff, the best food I've ever tasted and the decor is outstanding. We couldn't have had a better experience anywhere.",

    "text": "Came out for a nice dinner & to enjoy some $1 oysters & the service here literally turned my stomach sour. Upon greeting we were asked for indoor or outdoor seating & went with outdoor, after 10 mins we asked a food runner for menus & after another 5 went by I saw another couple get sat & promptly greeted with menus by a server. We decided to return to the hostess and get reseated inside. Maybe we would do better with the inside servers.    As soon as we sat down the server came over and greeted us and gave us menus.  However his knowledge of the menu was sub par.  Here's the worst part!   The manager finally came over and asked how everything was, we politely explained what happened and he stood there in silence.  It was so awkward he finally left.  Without apologizing or expressing any type of emotion.  Seriously you're the manager and you couldn't say I'm sorry for this and I'll make sure you have a better experience.   Nothing came out of his mouth!   When we saw our server next we asked for the check.  Why would I ever spend my money in an establishment that doesn't even have a manager that can apologize and think on his feet as to how to resolve a situation. They comped half of our check but all we were asking for was an apology.. would not return to this establishment even if I was paid to do so.",

Food is great, never complained about the food, but everytime I get this girl Alex, I remember her for being nasty.  What's odd is my 3 girlfriends sat with me, and one said \"oh not that girl, she's such a B\" We kept the talk short.   Today was just awful. The girl checking people on the outside sent us to the pizza bar. No chairs, 45 min wait. Then the girl at the hostess stand said \"we can seat you after 2:30\" (2 hrs away)  I said \"what she said 45 minutes\"  So she asked for my number. I wanted to leave  We go to the car, on the 215 and I get a text that the table is ready! What the hell is that.   This place went downhill fast, it's the service, not the food. And I feel bad leaving this review, because this is a good restaurant. But it's the kind of place that makes you not want to tip a server, and I'm not that type of person.   We had salmon, california Benedict, 2 nonstop mimosas, wine, chicken salad, no complaints about the food or drinks...",

Server- Jessica and other server were friendly.   Food service was WAY off. We were a party of 5. We ordered porchetta and eggs, French toast, steak and eggs, loco moco and poutine.  We arrived at 1030. I'll give them some leeway and said we ordered at 1045. We started slowly receiving our dishes at around 1115. Only two dishes at first, the poutine and the steak and eggs, which were both delicious. Then we got the porchetta and eggs, which we ordered before the rest of our meal as an app, but received it with everything else. We got the loco moco cold, I'm assuming they were holding it till everything else was ready. We received the French toast at 1130 and it was RAW. The batter was leaking out.   I was hoping that this place would be as great as it looks. The food is great. They just need to work on their food timing.",

I have nothing but good things to say about this place, always a good experience when we are here.   We have been here numerous times and nothing has ever disappointed me. Everything here is on point. From the cocktails to the service - down to the management. Thank you Mary for always taking care of us.   From brunch: my favorite is the duck and waffles and salted Carmel French toast (and bacon to balance the sweetness of the French toast) and all you can drink mimosa, need I say more.   Dinner: my favorite appetizers are halibut ceviche with watermelon with a lemon vinaigrette. Watermelon salad with feta avocado and mint vinaigrette.  So fresh in the summer time. Meatball pizza - to die for. And for entrees - I switch it up all the time. But tonight I had the black truffle hanger steak with aioli and potatoes. Only 33 dollars! Such a steal, way better than the steaks next door.    And if you have 20 minutes in the end, order that souffle.  Amazing!! (Burned hands by touching glass so a beware!) lol",

    "text": "I've been fortunate to be graced with a medium sized family however local dinner spots are not always accommodating when you bring the shorties with you but this is not the case with Hearthstone.  The dining room is very large so you don't hear other people's conversations while still being able to enjoy your own.  They also have a PDR (private dining room) at the front of the restaurant if your party requires privacy.  Hearthstone is another venue managed by Clique Hospitality and it shows.  From the start of the meal, you are greeted in a way that is the signature approach imparted by the owner Andy Masi.  Like all things in life, you want to feel comfortable and treated like a VIP and that's what happens at Hearthstone.  One of the best dishes at this venue is incredibly unassuming and ordered every time we dine and that is the Atlantic Salmon.  It's been discussed around the table as the best salmon dish our guests have tasted on multiple occasions.  My go to appetizer is always the lollipop wings (best wings ever) as well as the octopus.  The flatbread pizzas are all delicious (Abe Froman has the best flavor).  Management is always present and professional (touching tables throughout our dining experiences).  The GM, Sarah Bryner, always has a bright smile and is there to accommodate any request to enhance your dining experience.  Whether you are in the mood to listen to some impressive live music (Daniel Park) or enjoy the recurring Thursday Wine events, this is a great local restaurant offering a wide range of items to satisfy almost any mood.  Can't wait to go back as writing this has stirred up a hankering for some of those tasty wings!",

And the great thing is when you order the food and share it all its not only an experience for your taste buds but also such a great social experience as well.  Favorite dishes: Stuffed Date wrapped in Bacon and stuffed with Chorizo. Charred Octopus. Mushroom flatbread. Steak Tar Tar. Honey Truffle.   This is only a very small list of the dishes that I love.   My favorite drink MY BOY BLEU this drink is so amazingly perfect. It has Rosemary infused vodka, egg white, citrus liquor and does not disappoint. This is def worth going to Hearthstone for.   Give this place a try. I love it and I bring my family in every time they come here and they cannot get enough. Great job!",

    "text": "Tried out Hearthstone for the first time.  Menu is a bit complex for Tweens who would be more interested in a burger... Be we pushed through it!  Deviled eggs were good with the pimento cheese buried in the bottom a nice touch.  Crispy fries were more like logs and could have been passed over as other dishes were far batter.  Charred octopus was tender and perfect.  Lollipop wings were just perfectly spicy with a nice buttery flavor in the batter.  Sauce for the wings cooled them off just a bit.  Abe Froman flat bread was ok, but when you put mozzarella on a pizza you risk the bottom getting soggy.  Needs a crisp crust to make it killer!  Mac and cheese was a very nice creamy note and the meatballs (spare ribs) were just a touch of home!    Finished it up with the olive oil cake to top it off.  Service was good with many friendly staff offering to clear or help.  With tapas I would have liked a little more time spread out for the food to arrive, but in our case, it all showed up at once and the table got crowded.  Decor and atmosphere was an 8 out of 10 and would appeal to yuppies, metros, and folks walking in from the casino.  Would come back again without the kids next time.  But really enjoyed it.",

The farm to table concept makes me happy,  organic,  grass fed beef,  suckling pig ,  house made everything. You don't get that in most chain restaurants. My boyfriend came into town from LA so we thought it would be fitting to come here. We got seated at the lounge first because we didn't make a reservation and they were super busy so we didn't mind. Shaheena greeted us, recommended us the red rock sunset - which was amazing!  My boyfriend got the pimms which was interesting but. Yummy!   We finally sat down at our booth,  it was entertaining watching everyone running around. Every single server was welcoming,  Mary and Peter came by and also checked on how our evening was and it was sweet.   We ordered the baked ricotta with truffle honey on the side. To die for. Didn't think it sounded great but our server highly recommended that dish. That stuffed dates,  wow. Chorizo center wrapped around dates and fat bacon. Then we also got the crabby snacks,  hand picked crab.   For dinner I got the hanger steak, truffle on truffle Wow. I want more right now please. My boyfriend got the halibut with the black rice, forgot what else but it was great. Don't know what else everyone else got,  it was just good!  The average person was 60 dollars,  so definitely put a dent in my account but was it with it!??   Yes this is where memories are made and foodgasim happens. This is no yard house,  this is not TGIF. Everything is on point.   So make sure to try everything,  family style for apps. But entrees get your own because it's amazing. Save space  for desserts because we were full by then!    Enjoy.",

First off, the place was maybe 20% full and it was the slowest service I think I have ever experienced in my adult dining life. I always order my daughter's food with our drinks, so she won't have to wait as long. Over an hour after placing that order she was teary with hunger and when asked if it was possible to get her meal soon, and being told it was coming right out, we waited another 15 minutes. I wish I could say the food was worth the wait but it was not. The deviled eggs are decent, salad less so, and the lobster roll was not one of the better ones I've had. Our second round of drinks didn't show up until after we had finished our meal and asked for the check. Seriously- get it together. This place could be good, but you have a major service problem.",

    "text": "Probably the worst service at all the restaurants at Red Rock casino, Downtown Summerlin and the plaza across Charleston combined. Shame on me for trying his place multiple times hoping the next visit would be better. The food isn't bad but it's not great either. Based on food quality alone I'd rather eat at the franchise spots like Yardhouse or BJ's. (Both less than a few hundred yards away)  Last visit, I say with my wife and two kids. First we were given 1 menu...about 5 min later we were able to flag down our waitress to ask for other menus. Then was brought a 2nd menu. A few minutes later she comes by to take our order where I in turn ask for a kids, happy hour and a beverage menu? We watched the tables next to us get seated after us and have their orders taken and be on their way before we got all their menus. We order a handful of items and a couple of drinks (beer/wine). Food came out at a decent time and plates were bussed in a timely manner as the water was refilled with regularity so I can't knock the buss/beverage staff. When I wanted to order another round of beverages our waitress was M.I.A. And when we wanted to call for more food only god knew where our waitress was. When I finally got my second glass of wine I already Asked for the check and didn't bother to finish my wine. I spoke to the manager just to let him know if my experience. He offered the usual free dessert or drink but I told him I just won't be back.   There are so many other restaurants on par that are in literal walking distance from this one. I will just wait until this place runs out their lease and the next restaurant concept moves in. For other options I would suggest anything else at red rock. Even their sister restaurant Salute has their act together.  After restaurant's generic response: Oh yea, I was just reminded by the restaurant's response that it was a \"bottomless\" wings promotion. My wife and I both had to opt in for $10 each which is no biggie. They bright us \"refills\" once. So it was basically $10 for 9 wings. Hardly bottomless but I was already done with the place and don't want anything else to do with this place. God forbid they kick down napkins to a table with kids too. I can go on and on about the garbage service of this place... I think the service at the concession stand inside the theater is better than this place.",

Oh and now finally the rare Pokemon appeared five minutes later (insert eye roll here). Oh what did we order though? The French toast, California Benedict, pancakes, and corner beef hash. There was four of us lol anyways, tell me WHY MY FOOD WAS COLD when I got it. I didn't know corned beef hash was supposed to be cold? I felt like it had been left out or someone returned it and now I was getting it. After a few bites, I just stopped eating. My boyfriends french toast was cold too, not warm at all. Oh and my sisters pancakes were cold too. We've come here before and really liked it but today was a disaster. Horrible service and cold food. The place wasn't even busy for crying out loud. We decided to go to fatburger in the food court now instead of eating this.  Not sure if we want to come here again.

    "text": "Four of us and a baby went here for Christmas.  We had reservations for 6 pm, but they weren't able to seat us until almost 6:30.  It was a pretty busy night.    We had a booth shaped like a crescent where we sat with our backs against a wall.  It was comfortable except that it has really hard to talk to each other. The music was really loud and my dad couldn't hear me as we were sitting on opposite ends of the booth. For a holiday with so many families there from out of town, they could have turned down the music.  Nothing like a blasting of the song Sexual Healing to get you in the Christmas spirit! :)  The food was good. Two of us ordered the price fixe menu and two ordered a la carte.  Our bill was about $200.  The only thing that was bad was the Christmas cookies for the prie fixe dinner.  They were hard as rocks, not good, and didn't seem fresh.  But, we did enjoy the complimentary egg nog served in cute mason jars.  The service was mediocre.  We got sat 30 min after our reservation.  The servers have a really long intro when you sit down.  It made our eyes glaze over after the first 30 seconds or so.  We also asked for two modifications-no goat cheese under the meatballs and no cookie in the ice cream.  Both were completely ignored.  We didn't complain, but if you have an allergy Id be extra cautious. We also had our 3 week old and they didn't want us to keep her car seat on the stroller base and requested we keep the stroller in the entryway.  It's a small stroller.  Yet the table next two us had two strollers at their table.  Not so much an issue but I was nervous about the stability of their upside down high chairs considering the traffic in the area where they sat us.  Decent place with the potential to be great with some tweaking here and there.  There are so many great options in Vegas...even in the same casino.  Living in the area, I'm not sure it'd be our first choice next time we went out.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to give their brunch a try last week. We loved their dinner menu, and its difficult to beat $15 bottomless mimosas. We both ordered California Benedict, and while the eggs were expertly poached and the chicken and avocado very good, we were very (unpleasantly) surprised that, rather than being served upon an English muffin or other bread, it was served upon a tomato. The menu said nothing about the tomato, and I would never have ordered it if I had known (mostly because I hate tomatoes).  We asked for an English muffin instead, and not only did they replace our tomatoes with bread, the manager also came over and personally took care of it on our check as well. Hearthstone was genuinely concerned that we had a pleasant experience. Their customer service and food deserve five stars, but I took one because I feel the menu could be made more clear, so as to avoid situations like this in the future. I very much recommend this place, and can't wait to go back.",

We sat at the \"Chef's Bar\" which is basically a \"bar-style\" counter directly in front of the main chefs - the executive chef worked right next to us and chatted it up with us along with his second-in-command.  A very cool dining concept if you want to be at the forefront of the culinary action with the actual top chef(s).  Food was very good.  THICK Tomato Bisque Soup with a nice side Grilled Cheese Sandwich (the sandwich being a nice surprise).  The Flatbreads (we had the \"Abe Froman\") was very delicious as well.  Wait staff was decent - friendly.  I'd go back.",

    "text": "4 of us came for dinner on a Sunday night, we made a reservation and had absolutely no issue getting our table. The only downside to our table was that it was the first one by the door coming from outside...so every time the door was opened we got a blast of freezing cold air, but it wasn't very busy so it's not like it was a big deal.   Our server was AWESOME. Hopefully you guys get Danielle if you go. She's great.   Here's what we ordered: -Wine: they have an extensive wine list, I tried a sip and it was good. If you're a fancy wine drinker, I think you'll enjoy the selection. -Cocktails: I had the Blackberry Bliss, VERY GOOD. My husband had the Babymaker...I hated it, he LOVED it. He's kinda like an old man trapped in a young man's body, if that helps.   -Truffle popcorn to start.    *It's great. Everyone is on the truffle-train right now with adding it into everything they can think of so it's kinda played out...but this was still good. And it's not a tiny serving either, which makes it feel like it's worth the $7-$8(or whatever, I didn't pay attention to the price on it) you're paying for it. The one serving was split between the 4 of us and we didn't finish it, so it's a good size.  -Pepperoni flatbread, the Abe Froman flatbread, Salmon, and the rotisserie potatoes.     *Flatbreads were good, but nothing spectacular. The salmon got the job done, wasn't fishy like it can be, and had a great sauce to go with it. The rotisserie potatoes were AMAZING and I recommend them to everyone who can handle jalapenos.   I would definitely go again. It's got a super hipster environment, so you're gonna feel like you're not cool enough to eat here at first. It's worth it to stick it out though.",

When the waitress brought the menu, she seemed like she was doing us a favor being there. She was just awful ..bad bad service.  We ordered orange juice /they don't have fresh squeezed oj , it only smells like oranges/, coffee, the sticky bun, 3eggs omelet and California Benedict. I got the egg white omelet with a side of fruit instead of the regular omelet with a side of toast. I was too hungry to argue about it and just had whatever the waitress decided to give me.The sticky bun wasn't sticky at all..it was in need of moisture..it felt like \"yesterday's left over bun\".

So they gave me arugula and at the bottom was a HUGE DEAD BLACK MOSQUITO.  I about lost my dinner at the sight of it; led me to assume they didn't wash the arugula.  Manager took 50% off the bill.  I understand things happen, but It'll be hard for me to go back.  My date and I are both in the F&B industry and that was just outrageous.

Honestly, I was really drunk so my details of this night are not too great, but I will say a few things that I do remember:  1) The service here was not that great.  We had a room reserved, we were spending over $1500 here for dinner, but we had to on at least _4_ occasions go out and look for a waiter to ask the status of something (usually had to do with the drinks).  That's really unacceptable.  If we're dropping that kind of money on a meal, the guests shouldn't have to play hide-and-go-seek with the wait staff. Apparently the bar was \"backed up\", but I have no idea what that means.  At no point should it take 45 min to pour a glass of whiskey.   2) The suckling pig was really good.  If you have a big enough party, splurge on it.  I can't unfortunately give you too much advice on the portion sizes.  I don't remember how much we ate. I do know we had leftovers to take back.  We ordered 2 pigs for about 12 of us I believe.   3) If you're staying on the strip, beware that this is a very long taxi ride over.",

    "text": "Hearthstone has taken a page out of the HoneySalt playbook with a look full of rustic and homey elements that make for a cozy dining environment. The transformation of the space formerly occupied by Hachi is remarkable. The space is more inviting with its dark decor, open kitchen, two long bars, a lounge area and patio.  Small plates dominatef the menu, allowing diners to sample plenty of eats. Several salads are available. The wild arugula ($12) combines some wonderful flavors with citrus poached leeks, toasted hazelnuts, and ricotta, although the leeks were my least favorite element with it's crunchy texture and slight bitterness proving offputting. A much better option was the roasted heirloom beets ($14). Tender chunks of beets sat atop a bed of whipped ricotta with goat cheese and lemon thyme adding some brightness to the dish along with a bit of crunch from the pistachios.  Dishes are all beautifully presented, but not always successful. The tuna carpaccio ($14) lacked focus. An overpowering sweetness from avocado and plenty of acidity from tomatoes drowned out the flavor of the fish while the flower petal garnish didn't add anything to the profile of the dish. Thankfully more savory options like the butcher steak tartare ($14) and meatballs ($13) delivered in making the main ingredients the stars with supporting elements that heightened the flavors of each.  For those that want larger portions, entrees are available as well. The wagyu short rib ($28) is a dish perfect for cooler weather. The hearty, savory, stout braised beef and vegetables is comfort food at its best.  Their dessert list is full of options I'll have to return to sample. The lone dessert I've tried has been an almond chocolate chip souffle. Restrained sweetness and a silken, warm texture made it perfect for soothing the soul and tastebuds.  Hearthstone doesn't forget their younger audience either. A kid's menu is available with plenty of favorites. A pizza is available where kids can add their own toppings at the table and the resulting dish is then brought back to the kitchen to be cooked. Chicken fingers are on the menu, but unfortunately my kid found them to be too hard and underseasoned.  Expect higher prices due to the quality of ingredients and overall superior quality of food as compared with most other Summerlin spots. It may not be for everyone, but the Light Group has created a restaurant unique to this part of town with dishes more commonly associated with the Strip than the 'burbs.",

    "text": "Very nice atmosphere.  We went on St. Pattys Day just before we went to YBR (Yellow Brick Road).  The entertainment in house was a gentleman and lady who were very good!  So, why the three stars?  My wife's veggie sliders were very good and my cousins rotisserie chicken was also delicious.  Still, three stars???  Here's why...the rotisserie chicken took very long to come out, so we waited for that and our food, which was already out, started to cool.  The server said it should only be a few minutes after recognizing that she didn't have her food yet, but it was much more than a few.  My cousins husband and I ordered the burger and a beer special.  We ordered it medium but it was closer to rare.  We didn't tell the server because we needed to get over to the YBR show and, due to the wait for the chicken, we needed to get going.  Plus, as I mentioned, it was cool because of that wait. Oh...speaking of waits...  We originally had a wait of 5 minutes for a table, but we cancelled that because we wanted to get to the show, but we came back because we were hungry.  When we came back, the wait became 15 minutes, which was fine...we understood because we originally cancelled.  But, that 15 turned into 20, 25, and then 30 minutes as we sat waiting for a table.  The hostess kept us posted and we appreciated that.  She also showed us which table would be ours when another couple, just finishing up, would leave.  However, once they left, we waited even longer for the table to be cleaned and finally I  believe the Manager had to clean off the table.  Then, when we finished and asked for the check, we had to ask on if the bussers to find our server so we could get it and, eventually the Manager had to bring it to us.  So, not bad, but definitely not great.  Thus, 3 stars....",

Let me start off my saying my boyfriend and I both work in the service industry so we know what good service looks like.   I made a reservation on opentable and wanted to sit outside, the hostess was very sweet and let us know that the patio was very sunny and allowed us to try it out before sitting outside. She was very sweet and accommodating and we ended up staying outside. That's about where the good service ended. We ended up having two waitresses because the first one never came back around to our table. The second waitress took our food order and we waited thirty minutes for our food because apparently the chef didn't like the way the food was prepared? Two tables who sat after us got their food before us. Then they had to fix our check three times because there was stuff on there that we didn't order.   I will say however that the food was sooooo good. I had the egg cocotte and my boyfriend had the pancakes and both were delicious! I hope that I can convince my boyfriend to come back because the food was so good but I don't see that happening for a while. Very disappointing considering I really wanted to love this place.",

One of my favorites was the calamari (I want to eat that right now) and the stuffed dates (seriously you MUST order them)!! My most recent visit was for the Yelp Shares the Love Promotion. I enjoyed their Charcuterie (a fancy word for a fine meat and cheese) plate. This is the perfect little snack to enjoy wine with as I did. The truffle honey is to DIE for...I'm obsessed!!

When we were seated, we waited at least 15 minutes before we asked one of the staff to get our menus. The food was very good, atmosphere was loud. The service was poor. The hostess was unfriendly and our waitress was very slow and unprofessional. It took at least 20 min for our waitress to come to our table and take our order. There was an incident in the restaurant while we were there, as one of the staff dropped a plate of food on the ground and the pieces landed on my shoulder and our table. Thank god no one got hurt. We never got an apology or a visit from the management team to see if we were OK. We mentioned the incident to our waitress and she kinda ignored the situation by giving us an insincere apology. Honestly, we will not return to this restaurant until there is a major change in staff's attitude and better management engagement with customers. From my experience working in the service industry, poor management leadership leads to poor staff attitude and work ethics.",

Reservations for 2 at 8:15 pm. We were seated promptly and kindly. Ordered from the wine list. My friend and I split the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer. Delicious! Perfectly spiced marinara. We both chose salads as we wanted lighter fare. She has the shaved Brussel sprout Caesar and I had the chickpea chopped salad with added chicken. Both were perfect and not over dressed. The atmosphere was fun. The decor was cute, and we enjoyed the live music! I'll definitely go back and try a heartier entree! Service was perfect!",

It was uber crowded so we decided to snag a table in the lounge and eat there.  Since the seating was a bit awkward, we decided on passed apps and a few drinks.  I love the menu here and the concept is similar to chez panisse or its offshoot camino in Oakland.  The food was terrific and I would definitely come back to sample more.  The FG&J is a must try for foie lovers.  My wife also enjoyed a couple of the hand crafted cocktails.  Service was ok, but I'm not holding that against them.  It was a busy friday night and the cocktails waitress was pretty slammed.  Also, the restaurant is pretty loud, not just in the bar area, but also in the dining room.",

We skipped the bottomless mimosas due to them being quite pricey. And, the single order of mimosas for the price was also a tad much. You can get cheaper bottomless mimosas at other places in Summerlin and on the Strip.   I went with the eggs benedict which was good. It was't the best, but it was good and filling. My friend got the \"vegan\" version of the benedict, and she was a fan as well.   I would go back in the future to try out lunch and/or dinner.",

We started with fried oysters, 6 raw oysters, bacon wrapped dates, steak tartare, octopus roasted  and later added hanger steak. The fried oysters were very average however the rest of the food was very good. The steak tartare was the best I've ever had even with us having to send it back because the poached egg was pretty much raw however it was amazing. The oysters were good (once we got them) and the vinergrette that came with it was very tasty. The oysters were a dollar each on Wednesday and they were very good, I've done a lot of cheap oyster days and air of the time they use average oysters however these were good and the vinergrette really complemented it. The dates were pretty tasty   And the octopus was delicious so perfectly cooked. The hanger steak was very good as well. I base al my reviews on what you pay and what you get for the price, on this day they were very poorly staffed and we literally had problem after problem with the service, I have to admit the brunette female manager was very very good she was out working with the waiter for the entire area and as a business owner myself I have to admit she did everything she could to fix the situation and make everyone's experience that much better. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't come back because the service was so poorly under staffed however we  now will be.   Oh and the drinks were tasty.",

I enjoyed this place cause I felt as if I was not in Vegas but in the country side minus the parking lot haha Our server was very friendly and helpful! I will definitely want to come back here for their happy hour. The portions here were great to share with a group we ordered   Baked truffle ricotta: very good and tasty it has honey in it which gives a slight sweet taste to it and is served in a mini cast iron skillet. Truffle mushroom pizza: baked to perfection and had the right amount of cheese to dough ratio. The truffle flavor was not overwhelming at all Lollipop chicken wings: small bite size chicken tossed in a buffalo sauce that was not too tarty and had the right amount of spicy kick to it Tuna tartare: I really enjoyed this dish it came with wonton chips and the fish tasted fresh.  If you check in you get a glass of wine on the house and that was a plus! I had another drink called the blackberry bliss which was a very refreshing Moscow mule with a kick of blackberry flavoring to it   Great place and great ambience I recommend dining out in the patio !",

I had to stop her and ask her for a drink menu, and she seemed extremely annoyed that I did that. She shoved a drink menu over to us without saying a word and walked away.

I thought the outside area was really beautiful and the night we went the weather was great but it was a let down. Maybe my friend just hyped it up a little too much. I was expecting something better. I guess I should have tried something different. The service was good, our server was nice, answered our questions and always had our water filled.

Great bottomless mimosas and I ordered the newest item on the menu- the French Dip on a soft pretzel hoagie- to die for! The service was fantastic from hostess to server. Fun and yummy! Great decor, too with seafood \"market\".",

They also have a great happy hour from 5-7 so get down here. I plan on doing the whole pig roast feast here soon so I'll update and add pics when I do.   Employee's are friendly and service is always great even when their slammed, Jocelyn is my Favorite Bartender, she's a total Doll and makes such great cocktails. The kitchen staff you see behind the Raw Bar always have a smile on their face also however concerning the kitchen, sometimes depending on who's Shucking, it's only happened on Wednesdays I've gotten a huge amount of broken shell in my oysters but I know Shucking at easy expecially on Wednesday when they're a buck a shuck and every guest orders their own dozen, this has only happened a few times and it's hot that big if a deal but super annoying when you chomp down on shell.

    "text": "If I can give this place a minus stars I would. I Attended a networking event by two of the most  influential people I know, Candy & Charles, they bring anywhere from 50-100 business professionals together. They reserved the lounge area and found that not only did the venue double booked, they gave the lounge away to another group. They had us in their dining area which made it a tight situation. I came hungry because it was my intention to patronize the venue. Our group was ordering meals & drinks while we networked. I was speaking to someone when I get a tap from Sarah Bryner (who I later found out is the GM) in a very abrupt manner, she told me I need to move my drinks from the table because they are moving the table outside, no explanation. Before I can move my drinks, HER bus boy puts his hand on my drinks and proceeds to take it away. I told him to not put his hands on my glass since I was still drinking them.  They also proceeded to move the table outside in grand fashion, with our items still on it, insuring maximum humiliation. When we finally had a conversation with Sarah Bryner, I was shocked to find that she took no responsibility for any operations in her restaurant, including how she behaved towards me, and how she mishandled this whole situation. She didn't book the reservation so it's not her fault it was double booked, she didn't grab my glass so it's not her fault. She didn't bother to really listen to Candy & Charles' concerns , rather, she continued to interrupt them with \"I didn't do that, so I can't apologize for that\".  Needless to say, I left hungry because I didn't get to enjoy the after networking sit down dinner I had planned to have at the restaurant (would you, after such a treatment?) I was starving, so I ended up at Raising Cane's AND guess what? I got better service from a teenager in a T-shirt. What does that say about Hearthstone?",

I had high hopes and was excited but was definitely disappointed. All 3 glasses of pinot were good. It went from okay to pretty good by order of free (yelp check in) and escalating price.

My friend got a pepperoni pizza and I couldn't resist but try it and man it was worth every penny let me tell you! Staff was also pleasant to be around which is a huge plus in my books.

This is a very, upscale place, there appetizers aren't your normal appetizers!  Excuse me if  I spell this stuff wrong!  Duck liver (Foie gras) I looked it up!  lol  And Bacon covered dates, and steak Tartare (minced raw steak).  Sorry, I don't care for any kind of liver, I don't like dates, and I like my steaks med well!  So what they were serving up didn't sit well with me.   Then I guess they roasted a lamb with polenta!    I don't care for either one of those.  So needless to say, I didn't eat anything, but the wine......Which was the star attraction!   Was amazing!  I did know the name of it, but by the end of the evening........I forgot what it was, but it   was so good!  I'm pretty sure there doing it again this Thursday 12/18/14 if I didn't have plans already, I would be there!  Go check it out!  It was free!",

The portions the five for the sharing plates and flatbreads are enough for one, however for 28 dollars you would think the Waygu Beef short ribs would be bigger than two measly squared pieces. The flavor and texture was good, but when I spend that much I want more than 4 oz of meat. The pasta dish was I'd guess a half cup for 24. Again not worth it. The biggest problem was the way they handle business. They told us they could get us right in on a Saturday night but needed to bus the table. It took 20 minutes to bus the table. After 8 of us were done eating, they finally brought out our entrees (beef and pasta) for those who ordered it; we felt the need to share our discontent with the server who then got the manager. Rather than the manager being cordial he was a straight up pompous douche. He spent 20 minutes giving us excuses as to why they took 3 hours and how it is standard operating procedure.  Do not go here. Nothing would make me happier than to see something else in its place the next time I am at the Red Rock.",

    "text": "Huge disappointment! When we first walked in to the restaurant I had a really good vibe. Friendly hostess at the front and really nice decor. Our reservations were at 630pm and the rest of our party got there around 645. I'm hoping our main server was new because she seemed afraid to talk and was very unorganized. The second server that was helping was very confident and friendly.  My husband and I ordered the pizza special which was duck and prosciutto pizza, the wagyu short rib burger, the meat and cheese platter and the jalapeno hummus. We were a table of 12 so when everyone's food started to come out at different times at first it was understandable. About 30 mins into the meal glasses were empty and sat empty for a while. No water or alcohol to help ease the pain of waiting over 2 hours for our main course. One of our friends dishes was completely forgotten, our burger was not ordered and another friends cheese dish was not brought out (they only gave him bread, no cheese).  To add to the unorganized mess, our $21.00 yes I said $21.00 wagyu short rib burger was a total waste of money. They did a really good job making the exact replica of  the animal sauce at inn n out burger and it was overcooked. I would rather pay half the price for a black truffle cheeseburger a couple doors down at the yard house. The duck prosciutto pizza which was $19.00 had a few little pieces of duck that you could barely see/taste and a little tiny slice of prosciutto on each slice of pizza. Again not worth it.  To end the 3 hour long dinner the male server asks how things were and I told him it was OK. I normally don't like to complain but he asked me for my \"honest opinion\" twice more (I guess because he saw we only took a few bites of our $21 burger and not even trying the fries) so I told him in a nice way what I thought. Mentioning everything from the forgotten dishes to the 2 hour wait for our main course and the ridiculously priced burgers.  He tells us \"oh yes I heard about the forgotten dishes and the two our wait for food\" and apologized to our table offering a couple of free desserts. We kindly declined because at this point we didn't want to wait another hour for our dessert to arrive. When we received our bill the only thing that was taken off was one of the forgotten dishes. No manager came over to speak with us or anything. There are more negative things to add to this review but it is long enough already. I had really high hopes for this restaurant but will never be going back to this place.",

I could tell there was a lot of \"hidden salt\" in the food because I (and everyone else at our table) kept getting refill after refill on our drinks .. I'm still thirsty, now! The Gouda Mac n cheese needed a blend of a sharp cheese to complement the rest of the flavors. The chorizo stuffed dates need a better quality bacon and cooked a little longer for a crispy outer finish. It was soggy .. Gross! The meat and cheese platter didn't excite me either, it didn't provide a wow factor where I could set it apart from other restaurants meat and cheese platters. The service was a bit dusty and could use better training. Many times we had to ask for plates and utensils. The server didn't know the menu very well either which wasn't very helpful as it was our first visit to the restaurant. Aside from all that, the staff was very nice and approachable, the restaurant was set up beautifully and the dessert was UH-MAZE-ING!! It was a Peanut Butter Butterscotch Lava Cake topped with whipped cream, crushed peanuts and a side of banana ice cream. I must say it's probably one of the best desserts I've had , ever! All the textures and flavors were there. The best part is when I cut into the cake and all of the warm caramel-like filling came oozing out. And for the perfect bite you have to get a little bit of everything on your spoon and it's heaven in your mouth!",

We found Hearthstone warm and inviting and can't wait for warmer weather to sit outside and enjoy the patio. We had the deviled eggs first and the pimento cheese center adds to the flavor. Next came the meatballs with an outstanding marinara sauce that I couldn't get enough of. A pepperoni & mozzarella flat bread pizza rounded off the meal then a nice glass of Merlot on the couch was a great way to relax and just take it all in. We'll be back to try the 40oz porterhouse for two.",

I've not tasted anything that wasn't spectacular. I didn't particularly care for the sight of a baby suckling pig roasting on a spit but the pork dishes are amazing. Overall, the place seems extremely well managed. Highly recommended and I cant necessarily say that about other Red Rock Resort restaurants.",

Seems to be very popular with the young professional crowd.  We ended up trying the charcuterie board, baked ricotta, meatballs, carbonara flatbread and fire roasted clams. Everything was exceptional with some unique flavors, especially the truffle honey. The only miss was the flatbread. It was soggy and the shaved onions gave it a slimy texture.  Service was acceptable. Our waitress knew the menu and made solid recommendations. Timing was good until the very end. We waited way too long for our bill and we were ready to go.  We will defiantly be going back to try more of the very large menu!!!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars.   We made a reservation for 4 on Saturday night. We had to wait in the lounge about 20 minutes past our reservation time. No biggie. We reviewed the menu and chatted.   I didn't drink but my dining compadres had mixed reviews of their cocktails. One good, one bad. Pricey, as expected, around $12.   Ambiance is very cool. Decor is awesome. It's noisy and upbeat inside. Casual, hip, and comfy all at once. Nice room. Perfect spot for a drink and some snacks. There's shuffleboard too.   We tried loads of items and shared everything. Grilled octopus, stuffed dates, four gras mousse, clams, tuna carpaccio, pork rillette, mozzarella flatbread, meatballs, squash. They will give you bread upon request which was needed. There was not enough served with the rillette or foie. The stunners were the octopus and dates. The octopus was so flavorful and tender. The dates were big and scrumptious. It was very cool that the server offered to change the serving to 4 so we could each have one. The squash was under seasoned and cold. The rillette was very bland. Clams had a delicious favor but were tiny so a bit dry. Foie mousse was good but very light on the foie flavor. Carpaccio and flatbread were tasty.   Service was over zealous. They were super upbeat and friendly but we were slightly over served. There was constantly, and I mean constantly, someone asking how we were, asking to clear plates, filling water etc. I told 6 people I wasn't done with a plate because I was dipping bread in the sauce. I finally gave up and let them take it away. Arguably, this is not a bad thing. We certainly got everything we needed and had plenty of attention. But, it was to the point where you couldn't finish a sentence in the conversation without being interrupted.   We had the peanut butter lava cake filled with butterscotch and finished with banana ice cream. Absolute perfection. Very clever and delicious.   All in all, a very nice and delicious experience. I would definitely return. Items are great to share for 2 people. Most are too small to share with 4.   6 drinks, and bunches of tapas was $211 for 4, so $251 with tip. Certainly a pricier than usual dinner, but a fun addition to Summerlin.",

    "text": "04/10/16 BRUNCH  Some observations.  NEGATIVE: As they were staying on-property (the Red Rock Resort) a friend called to make a reservation for brunch here a few days prior. They asked the hostess for a table at 130pm for eight people, explicitly stating that two in the party were in wheelchairs. My spouse and I arrived minutes in advance of everyone else to find that a high-top was being held instead of standard tables. My spouse told the hostess we needed to change to standard tables due to two being in wheelchairs. It took until after 2pm before we were finally seated.  POSITIVE/NEGATIVE: We were given food menus but not drink menus. There were a few drink \"specials\" listed in the food menus, one being a bottomless mimosa using Mumm sparkling wine for $24. When I asked about other possible options the server said there was another bottomless mimosa I could order that was only $14 because it used a cheaper sparkling instead of Mumm. So why wasn't the cheaper mimosa listed on the menu? And why wasn't a drink menu offered to the table, with that cheaper mimosa listed? Does management assume since they are located in Summerlin they serve nothing but \"deep pockets\" clientele? No matter, the spouse and I ordered $14 bottomless mimosas.  POSITIVE: After ordering our food the complementary pastries the staff delivered to the table were lovely.  NEGATIVE: For my brunch I ordered their $21 chicken & waffles, as did one other person at the table. Expecting a rather healthy portion of each, I was sadly mistaken. Later I told my spouse the chicken, as well as the two small round waffles cut into quarters, were overcooked. Also, of the two tiny pieces of chicken given to me, one was filled with gristle. Funny thing is, the other person at the table who had ordered the exact same dish told their spouse the exact same thing I had said, which I discovered later after I spoke with their spouse. This was absolutely one of the worst plates of food I have ever been presented in Las Vegas, and I've now lived in Vegas for over five years. The only reason I did not send it back was because our friends at the table had a limited time to be present, as two had to be on a bus headed to the airport, and we had already lost over 30 minutes with the mistake regarding the table at the very beginning of the brunch.  POSITIVE: The carafes of bottomless mimosas came continuously.  NEGATIVE: My spouse paid our check, but during the process became distracted by the other guests, so they didn't check the prices carefully. Turns out the $14 bottomless mimosas were charged as $15 each.  Considering the condition of my food order as well as the overall expense (after tax and tip it was $89+ for the two of us), I doubt we'll ever return here. Well, except perhaps to drink cheap mimosas and eat comp'd pastries.",

The kale caesar salad was delicious and the charcuterie board was spot on (and served on a cute little wooden piggy!).  The 'toast and jars' is a cute idea and reminds me of FIX a bit. The ricotta and honey jar paired great with the toast.   The atmosphere is trying a little too hard to fit the, 'hipster-we're-different-but-all-the-same' bill...a little inauthentic. And service was definitely shaky; we had two interchangeable waiters that kept repeating the same requests, resulting in neither bringing what was offered.   Hopefully they polish up the service soon because I'd love to come back again.",

    "text": "Came here after seeing they offered $1 oysters Wednesday nights on unloktlv. My husband and our roommates all enjoyed this restaurant. The lighting is dim when you sit so there's candles on each table.   We all ordered 2 dozen oysters each and I also had a pizza on the side. The oysters were fresh and delicious. I liked one of the sauces it came with and asked the waiter to bring more of that sauce since I had run out after eating 6 of my oysters. The pizza was a good supplement to the oysters and helped me to get full. My roommates got their chicken pot pie which they raved about. They said it was amazing, fluffy, and delicious.   Overall, we all enjoyed our experience here and have said we would come back and try this place again.",

The loco moco is so Hawaiian and great.  Bottomless mimosas at $15 is buzz inducing ;) and well priced. Just go and if u can ask for him  Just went back today for bottomless mimosas and brunch! Had an amazing maple breakfast pizza for appetizer that was incredible with California Benedict that was so unique with avocado and a poached egg and the loco moco which was soooo satisfying. Of course, our server Ahmed took such good care of us again and made sure we had a fabulous time. Always a pleasure at Hearthstone!",

I told my main waitress, Melissa, that if the rest of the world was run as well as this place our problems would be over.  Excellent management as demonstrated by consistently passionate, happy and attentive staff.  I couldn't blink without Melissa rushing across the room to top up my wine glass.  The food was excellent with a well conceived menu that made selecting a dish very difficult.  I chose the prime rib, a super fresh salad and au gratin potatoes.  They brought out two little bowls of coarse salt and pepper at my request. Very nice.  Also their bread is delicious. Do try it if you eat bread. The atmosphere is lively but warm.  You can be comfortable solo (as I was), as a group big or small, or as a romantic couple.  The space is just designed that way.  I chose to sit at the kitchen bar in a very comfortable chair.    Prices are very fair, and I don't hesitate to recommend coming here. On my next trip to RR in LV, I will be certain to come back for dinner.  If I were an aspiring restaurateur I'd work here to learn how to do things right.",

I decided to go with the Filet Mignon, and I thought it was wonderful, but I thought it was interesting that the wait staff didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. They brought it out cooked a little more-so than I normally have my meat-dishes cooked as I typically like them on the rare side.  Other than that the service was great, I thought that they accommodated our party of 20+ pretty well. Our waiter kept the Macallan's coming.",

I always look for something different and unique that makes me want to come back just for that particular dish.  The service and that staff were on point. Our server was super nice, and our food was served promptly.  The food was really good. I got the Lobster boil, which I feel should have been served different. I mean, it could have been cracked to make it easier to open so that I can enjoy the meal rather than fighting with the darn thing. I rather get down and dirty to eat like this if I was at a Boiling Crab/Hot N' Juicy where guest are properly equipped to eat in that sort of fashion. The meat from the lobster tail could have at least pulled out. Anyway, the lobster was cooked very well as well as the potatoes and the sausage. My husband ordered the braised short rib. It was pretty good, but the serving was so small. It had this creamy cheese-like thing that was not very appetizing to the both of us.  Overall, this place is just too overpriced for what it is. There wasn't a wow factor about this place that would make me come back. Four-stars was for the service.",

When we arrived, we were told the tables are for large parties only and we had to sit at a couch so that equated to leaning down to eat and reaching up to feed a kid.   I get that all places are not kid friendly but can you say so when a reservation is booked ahead? Ruined my evening and had to leave.  We were offered a table suddenly on the way out as well.

Then came a flurry of apps : the meatballs, buffalo chicken wing lollipops, the charcuterie/cheese board, the Abe Froman pizza and the absolutely delicious baked ricotta! As you can tell the baked ricotta was my fav and if you go here I would say it should be a must on your list of things to order. So by the time allll of that was done oh and drinks too (several speciality cocktails all of which were strong and delicious!!) me and the hubby were way too full to order an actual dinner. So instead we each ordered one more app as our entrees. He got the tuna tartare and I got the grilled octopus.  Both were outstanding and I have to say that might have been the best cooking of octopus Iv ever had. It was sooooo tender it was like butter. His tartare was yummy though the pieces were cut rather large for a tartare. I'd call it more of a fusion poke and they served it with Indian style papper.  It also happened to be my mother in laws birthday so there was a surprise chocolate cake at the end which was a cute touch. The cake itself however wasn't that good. But frankly I didn't care being insanely stuffed full of delicious baked ricotta and octopus. Which is saying a lot for this chocolate lover!!",

It's so great to see a manager so attentive to her staff and customers. She was always smiling and nice see happy people. You can tell she enjoys her job. No wonder why her staff is so great, it starts from the top! I recommend this restaurant for sure. Ask for Jayde! After brunch, we stayed for a while, played shuffle board then the musical entertainment started. So happy we stayed because he was amazing! I thought it was a whole band and he's a one man show.

He gave us recommendations and would chat with us from time to time. Loved that he took the time to check back with us to make sure we were doing good. We appreciated his awesome customer service and his fun personality. Thumbs up for Jose!  We ordered 4 appetizers in which were the Bacon Wrapped Dates, Crispy Calamari, Lollipop Chicken Wings, and Prosciutto & Arugula Pizza (the pizza was not really an appetizer, but there were 4 of us and we were super hungry). It was all so tasty! My personal favorite were the Bacon Wrapped Dates.   We then ordered the medium size of the Shellfish Platters and it was shareable between the 4 of us. I personally thought it was yummy as well, but then I met the Braised Short Ribs and I couldn't get enough of it lol.   We ordered a couple of drinks. I had the Flower Bomb and it was bomb lol! It took me back for a second lol. Jose recommended this drink! It wasn't too extra on the sweetness. I also ordered the Endless Summer. This drink was also good, but it had a very sweet pineapple taste to it and so I switched back to the Flower Bomb.   As for desserts, we ordered the Nutella & Chocolate Pot de Creme, Kahlua Milkshake, and the Peanut Butter Lava Cake. Jose was awesome and brought out the Pineapple Upside Down Cake and the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding for us on him! Loved all of the desserts! I felt like we already ordered half the dessert menu lol.  Definitely try this place out if you're looking to try something new. Can't go wrong with this place!",

It is noisy, but a perfect spot to go out with friends/family for good cocktails and delicious food.   Service - 5/5: Our server was perfectly timely, nice, and knowledgeable of the menu items. He made for a very pleasant experience.   Apps - 4/5: Oysters on the Half Shell (East Coast). These were delicious, however we ordered a dozen and only got eleven.    Cocktails - 5/5: Didn't order anything special. My girlfriend and I ordered Gin and Tonics. My Mom ordered \"My Boy Blue\" and a glass of wine. She loved them both.   Food - 5/5: I ordered the Hangar Steak that came with a side of steak fries. We ordered two sides for the table; Mac and Cheese and Brussel Sprouts. My girlfriend got the New York Strip and my Mom got the Prime Rib. All of it was incredible and cooked perfectly.   Overall, this was a fun and refreshing dinner experience and I'll definitely go back!",

We ordered the calamari, oysters, New York strip, and braised short rib. Everything was ridiculously tasty!! I had no complaints except for I should've ordered more oysters because those were perfect.   Jayde and Russell both made it a point to check up on us several times throughout our time there which I really appreciated.   Overall, a wonderful dinner.",

It was super busy for a Friday night so we decided to sit in the bar/lounge area.    I ordered a glass of the Australian Sauvignon blanc excellent choice!! Happy hour menu we ordered oysters and chicken wings.  Both items was awesome I ended up ordered a 2nd order of oysters.  Main dishes - hubby ordered the fried chicken with biscuits, it was very good a little sweet for my taste as I prefer spicy chicken but hubby loved it! With a side of garlic mash potatoes which was just okay.  I ordered the shrimp & grits! Excellent!! Tasty and the dish was pretty filling.  I'd definitely come back for this dish!

Went on opentable and saw there was an opening for 545.  A bunch of empty tables as well. They weren't able to honor that reservation -- I get it but warn others to call and make sure they can honor it because they stated \"we honor those that make a reservation the night before not day of\" -- uh?? That's not how it works. But the issue I had was how the lady at the front huffed and puffed about it and gave the worst hospitality she ran to the managers office to bring him out and he also did not give the best customer service.  Work with your customer. Don't give such attitude. I'll question coming here.",

It's their $1 oyster night and it's a good bargain.  I got a half dozen oysters and then their pulled pork sandwich--pulled pork butt, Swiss cheese, ham, BBQ mustard, apple cabbage slaw, and spicy pickles.  It's almost like a Cuban but without that kind of bread and press grilling.  A good tasting sandwich served with shoestring fries.    For dessert, I went for something different on the menu, the Nutella chocolate pot de creme.  This was very rich and very good.  Two warm cookies were served with the dessert.  The heating melts the chocolate chips.  Be prepared to get chocolate on your hands but licking your fingers is quite appropriate!  My server was Ahmed and he was on top of everything such as getting a spoon for the dessert when he realized immediately why I was just sitting there and not diving into the Nutella/chocolate goodness.  Since Hearthstone is very good and so close to home, this is becoming a go to spot for myself and for taking friends visiting from out of town.",

Also, it rarely gets busy at brunch so you're not talking over your friends/screaming over the music.   The BEST menu item here is the breakfast pizza (brunch only item) comes with a soft poached egg, bacon, cheese, and maple syrup.   The Avocado toast is okay, it does come with various sprouts and is super aesthetic but I'd stick with some of their other menu items. (I'm picky about my avocado toast)  Almost everything else on the brunch menu is good, better than your average brunch restaurant. Other than the pizza I like the loco moco, prime rib French dip, and chicken & waffles. All the serving sizes are rather large so I like to order a few plates and share.   Come when it's nice out so you can sit in the cute outdoor seating section. This would be a good place to come watch a game as well, they have multiple TVs and bar seating.",

After all of the attention bestowed to the twins and their party; it was time for them to go to bed.   Twins go down and the adults get down. With my resent Tequila kick we decided to spend the evening with the ladies. Jose was our host and guide to the nights festivities. It was margaritas with salt and lime all around.   The very back of this restaurant has an open space that has couches with beautiful tables for hangin out and sipping cocktails. There are game tables back here too even. It is a place where children are allowed too even. It seems that time shared along side their parents or other family for special bonding is something all ages can enjoy.   The feel of this particular area is so amazing and positively radiant. The happiness of the guests in the restaurant project rays of glee and sunshine.  When we approached the hostess she waved us through to the bar. The bar fills up here real quick I see. But there is ample seating next to the bar. Which include tables (single round tables some here square too) to place drinks only on; plus crouch lounge area.  Taco Tuesday is celebrated here every Tuesday, plus the tacos are amazing. Their restaurant has a menu dedicated to only taco Tuesday too (this is why our tacos were so inexpensive)! Priceless.  The bar has a huge still behind the counter so more sober it is in the bookmarks to check this place out. Wine seems to be the claim to fame here. So many beautiful displays of main of all sorts. My kinda place! The menu does have a dedicated section to wine celebrations. I have been informed that this is the Cellar in their name comes from! Indeed on the list for wine sampling and tasting . If seeking that this is definitely the place.  The staff here is amazing at every turn someone is there to help you. One cannot go wrong with that. I do believe they need more servers, since it was hard to find ours during our visit here. This is nothing I would demonize her for. That is why the five stars stand! Do not remember her name; but if we approached her for another margarita, she waved at our table and brought another round by! Plus she kept our water coming too. One must stay hydrated in our desert \"hellish\" heat. We made it to round four before we all called it a night.   The decor of the Hearthstone conveys such a strong and powerful name. It has that old world type feel with the Cellar and everything made with masonry. The decor around the restaurant has a post war feeling then coming out with glory and rebuilding for all! The incorporations of the out doors into the decoration as ornamentation immensely reflects as one walks through the door. Do not take my word for it; here is the mental picture now go and see for yourself.  So now you know why to go here; and what it looks and feels like. So check thee old planner and go. Tuesday's seem to be the best days; but it's busy. If little ones go with might want to check into the details of there allowance to the bar type area ahead of time! My next trip already on the calendar! So then that's the end! Hope you enjoyed! I did!   Adieu!",

    "text": "UPDATED: We've heard several times in our lives the old adage \"If at first you don't succeed, try try again.\"  This is exactly the kind of ideology shared by Hearthstone's General Manager Russell. After realizing that our first experience was not great, he immediately reached out to us and promised us a better experience if we came back. He lived up to his word. This time, we were immediately greeted by Andrea at the front door (outdoor seating side) and we were seated immediately for our 6pm reservation. We were then introduced to Rigo, a veteran server from the original days of Wolfgang Puck, who would be out server for the night. Rigo was very personable and gave us just enough attention to make sure everything we needed was taken care of, but not so much where it went overboard.  Even though our section was busy, my drink never went empty and Russell also stopped by to make sure everything was in order. It is not often where someone running a restaurant pays attention when someone has a bad experience. Russell, on the other hand, made sure that customer service was his number one priority. Hearthstone has definitely gained a couple of long term customers after tonight.",

This is a MUST go to place but Gerson has to be our server when we return!!!",

Today we dined on breakfast yummies as kids created football paper jersies, made homemade cotton candy, donned their cheeks with football stickers and delighted in Hearthstone's two shuffleboard tables.  My girlfriend and I were able to catch-up, laugh, eat & RELAX all while watching our children keep themselves entertained at the craft/game area just a few feet away. Today we enjoyed the best service thanks to Ahmel, a few months ago we dined al fresco by the water and Christian was our server; consummate professionals with an eye for detail & heightened dining experience, the management is always warm & welcoming, the food highly craveable and the ambiance 10 outta 10 with a casually cool, elegantly inspired, urban vibe. We love the burgers, eggs benedict(s), shrimp cocktail, DIY pizzas for the children, oysters AND whatever specialty dessert they are serving. Highly recommend for family brunch, mama's night out, date night before a movie and everything in between!  Also love their sister restaurant, Bottiglia in Henderson. Can't wait to go back.",

Very attentive to keeping my water filled, and kept checking back to make sure everything was alright with my meal or if I needed another beverage. I am also in hospitality and it's so appreciated when little things like having water replaced goes a long way. Oysters were great. She also talked us into having the fish and chips special.

Having already spoken of service, music, and scenery in several prior reviews suffice it to say that seats at a hightop juxtaposing the pass were as delighful as ever, the salads, shared plates, and pizzas all across-the-board excellent the wood fired rib cap was boldly flavored and tender with scorched onions and reduced wine adding just the right amount balance as well as flare.  At this point unable to pass on The Whole Beast Feast, again served with a crock of creamy polenta and the housemade-mustard/roasting jus/apple-butter trio, suffice it to say that all eight of us were stuffed to capacity with nearly two-pounds of pig leftover even before dessert's arrival - another duo of cakes from Peridot Sweets every bit as good as the first while the not-so-secret pancake balls proved as yeasty and irresistible as ever.  Not quite as perfect as in the past, several favorites stripped from the menu during lean months during which Salute has been a focus, Hearthstone remains the class of the Western Suburbs by a rather substantial margin, the upcoming conference season hopefully to see the return of more innovative items.",

Other must tries, the tartare, the meatballs, the shaved Brussels sprout salad and my favorite flatbread is the Carbonara flatbread. Great environment and they have inside and outside seating.",

This place has the most incredible juices (which they were out of all 3.) we ordered the bubbles for breakfast with champagne (rose was given) which didn't really make sense with orange juice but after waiting 40 minutes to get it when it's 104 degrees outside we were not willing to complain and wait it over again. We watched multiple couples walk out of the outdoor patio upset because no one had greeted them, ever. Our bill total was $165 as Rachel as our server and it was hard to swallow considering the experience . We are locals and will unfortunately be finding a new brunch spot where we feel appreciated .",

The menu is seasonal, everything seemed to be wild caught, grass fed, organic, and house made. You're paying for quality food, memorable service, and quality people. They don't have ranch for their wings but it's still pretty good with the sauce it comes with. I bring all my friends, family and associates that come in to town. A few of my favorites that I like to show off is baked ricotta, stuffed dates, pizzas, and pimms 50 cocktail. I recommend this place! Cannot wait for Salute to open. Great for dates or for a fun night out.",

    "text": "Same experience as Alex we were seated out side toke the waitress 3 times to get our drink order when out 3rd person tried to order a cocktail she walked away half way thru the drink order. Which  was water with ice and maybe a half of shot of vodka for $11. We All order the unlimited wings which 3 people had to share while other tables has a plate to each person. We weren't the waitress friends like the table next to use. We had the bust boy doing our drinks and re ordering he had better customer services then the waitress. Wow the wings were amazing but it was pathetic to have to eat one plate wait 20+ mins for the second plate. By our 3rd plate they had run out of wings yet the people next to us had each a plate each for 5 people fresh \"out of wings\" by 9pm when you open at 5pm. She then tried to charge us $17 per person when the hostess and website had said $10 per person all you can eat. She had the greatest comment of all \"you guys ate the most wings out of all my customers tonight\" gees thanks 2 grown men and 1 girl  we ate 3 plates that had maybe 12 wings not hooters/Pizza Hut/wing stop/ buffalo wings size these wings are called lollipop wings for a reason they are small! The steak friends were a joke I had no steak on them one full potato cut into small pieces. I also had a issued with my card really!!! Did you try to actually run it. What a miracle you try a second time and have no issues. Well I guess I'll have to keep going somewhere, else. Sucks food was great but customer services was a joke they might as well have a place to order and pick up avoided the waitresses.",

    "text": "Three stars is a rating reserved for a place I would return to. Hearthstone is, unfortunately, not one of those places.   My mother received a gift certificate for her hard work to come dine at this 'fine' establishment. However, because she works so hard, she has no time to use it and thus this duty fell onto me: her eldest. I was delighted to come with my better half so we could do dinner and a movie.   Movie was great, and we hoped to end dinner on an even higher note to round out our night but it was not to be so.  Entering the establishment you will see an eclectic collection of items to your right, from white plaster animal heads mounted on this wall to mirrors and signs and photos of varying degrees 'aged' to have that vintage quirkiness that is all the rage these days.  I think it was supposed to be chic but instead it ended up being a metaphor for the theme of dinner this evening: a menagerie of 'stuff' without any True taste to speak of.   Our waitress seated us, was very kind, bubbly, but all of that seemed to disappear as soon as we presented her the gift certificate - something that would later continue to be confirmed throughout the night as she attended to other tables literally adjacent to us much more feverishly. We brushed it off however as she did continue to at least be attentive enough of our table that she made sure we never ran out of water. (And despite gratuity being included in the certificate we left cash for her on top of that.)  Service aside, let's get down to the good stuff (or mediocre in this instance): Food. My other half had the scallops (with cauliflower puree, farro risotto, and lemon) I had the pot pie (with rotisserie chicken, roasted vegetables, and truffle veloute)  We shared two sides:  - Sweet potato fries (with a harissa yogurt dip)  - Mac & Cheese (Brie and Fontina cheese)  I want to start off by saying that it is a sad, sad day when the sides are better than the actual entrees. However, that being said, it was not a meal to remember over all.  You know you're at a good place when you are excited to dig in and continue to eagerly dig in consistently through the evening even if you are full, and this was exactly what didn't happen. Once the initial excitement of having food on the table died down it was a steady decline that ended in us picking at our food in rather disheartened manner.  The mac & cheese despite being initially delicious was far too rich five bites in and is sorely lacking more breading to even out how much cheese and butter and god knows what else it's dripping in -- or perhaps an accompaniment of crostini would help greatly. The fries, as they cooled, began hardening at the centers in a manner that frozen food products do and therein also lost their appeal as the meal sagged on.   My other half, an avid lover of scallops, told me he liked them but that the entire plate as a whole did not feel worth $36.00, rather, $20.00 and he was even further put off when one of the scallops proved to still be sandy and therein not all too properly cleaned before having been fired. It was then he confirmed he would never order the plate again should we ever return.. if we ever returned.   Our waitress, bless her, misheard me when I had been debating between the fried chicken and pot pie so she had rushed a pot pie order for me. She warned me it would take twenty minutes and I confirmed it would be okay so I patiently waited, hoping for a pot pie that would make any grandmother green with envy for daring to overshadow her family recipe.  I think instead grandma would have died laughing at it.  They definitely rushed it in an attempt to get it to me quickly instead of taking their time and salvaging their already crumbling credibility.  A lot of the vegetables in the filling were still raw (like the peas), and at one point I found half an onion (I kid you not) still just in it's freshly chopped form sitting in the skillet surprisingly cooked through. There was supposed to be rotisserie chicken in it but I maybe found a tablespoon's worth (and that's being generous), and it tasted like chicken does when you've cooked it, leave it for a few nights, and microwave it too long. A sham and a shame. To top it all off there wasn't a hint of salt or any other sort of seasoning in the filling. My favourite part of the whole thing, and most flavourful at that, was the crust but I'm pretty sure it was just well seasoned phyllo dough. The plate was priced at $27.00, but I think even $15.00 would have been pushing it.   So, overall, it's a night I'm so glad is forgettable because I don't want to waste a second more remembering it. Maybe someday in the future I'll find the inspiration to try Hearthstone again but anytime within the next year would be too soon for me. Had we been wowed we would have been more than happy to return because if there's one thing we can shell out money for, it's amazing food and a good atmosphere. C'est la vie, Hearthstone. C'est la vie",

Even with the food being delish, The best part of our experience though was the service. Everyone who came in contact with us from the hostess, to the bartender (Nicole) and our server (Taylor) was extremely personable.

    "text": "No problems with my 6:45 reservation, restaurant is nice, decor is inviting yet casual. Service was ok: server was good but timing of courses was off. Main course arrived before salads, which (salads) seem to be a bottleneck. The salads were slow coming out, granted they were tasty and fresh. Timing issues must be solved quickly or it will become chaos for guests.  Biggest opportunity is the portion size vs the price. Either the entrees are overpriced or the portions are too small, one of those two has to change to succeed. The shrimp pasta entree is a ridiculously small portion at that price. There is too much competition in Red Rock and with Wolfgang Puck and Crave in Downtown Summerlin, small portions could be a show stopper.  I give it a 3 star to start but it certainly has the potential to improve and we will go back.   Manager came to our table to apologize for the salads and bought us drinks and credited the salads. Nice but it's better and cheaper for them to solve those problems.",

    "text": "I dined here last night for my birthday and the food was definitely 5 stars but the service was more like a 2-3 stars.   Let's start with the service. First they have 2 entrances so I came in one side and another friends came in the other. I was seated with the promise that my friends at the other door would be seated with me as well. However I had to text them to see where they were and they was still waiting? The hostess clearly didn't communicate with the other.   After we were seated, we were served water right away. After 10 minutes our server came by and we ordered drinks. Our server then disappeared. Our drinks came but we waited 45 minutes before our server came back around to take our food order. That was pretty disappointing... But she was friendly and thankfully we had our drinks. The Blackberry cocktail was very tasty.   The food was delicious!!! The Baked Ricotta was seriously to die for, and steak tartare was superb and the meatballs were amazing!!! We also had the Mac and Cheese with the cauliflower which was different and surprising a great compliment. I was only disappointed in the Roasted Squash. It was bland and over cooked.   It was my birthday so we obviously ordered dessert. Can you believe on the dessert menu, they didn't have a single chocolate item?! So we ordered the peanut butter and butterscotch molten cake and WOW!!! It was so different but in a good way and didn't make me miss the chocolate dessert at all!   The price was good too. 5 small plates and endless cocktails split between 4 girls and it was only $50 each. Pretty decent! I'll definitely be back. They had a lot of items on the menu I'd love to try!",

Jessica was our server, made sure we knew about the pizza special -- half off on Sundays -- so we got two. The Truffle pizza was particularly good. Also got the DOC pizza, hummus and the Quinoa/Apple salad, which were all tasty. All came out super fast, maybe because we got there early. They kept our water glasses filled all night. Small thing but appreciated. Totally recommend.",

We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  The price was a bit high for the smaller portions but then you pay for trendy or end up w too many people. So that is the good.   The reason for only 3 stars is the service. It was slow and when we pointed out that they brought the wrong toast they charged us to bring out the right one. They didn't even offer to swap the two.",

I suggest requesting a booth which are elevated by one step and provides a great view of the kitchen and bar. The booths seat four and are very comfortable. Our booth was directly across from the Suckling Pig Rotisserie. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Service was attentive by checking with us throughout dinner and refilling the water glasses. The menu has a wide selection of small bites as well as a choice of entrees. The Wood Roasted Clams looked interesting but was not available that night. The stuffed Dates with Chorizo, Bacon and a Piquillo Pepper sauce come 3 to an order and were very tasty. The pepper sauce added a nice mild flavor.  The Meatballs,  3 to an order are made with Braised Short Ribs, goat cheese and placed in a pool of tomato sauce. These were juicy and perfectly paired with the tomato sauce.  There are a several choices of Wood Oven Roasted Flatbreads. Really thin crust Pizza cut into 8 slices. The Primavera Flatbread has thin sliced zucchini, cherry tomato's and pesto. The crust was soft with a nice hint of smoke. The tomatoes juicy and tender. 8 slices are enough for 2 people. If the pricing was adjusted I would have awarded 4 stars. Considering the size of the shared plate items the price should be less. The Flatbreads are plenty large but the price is higher than other neighborhood places.  Hearthstone does not have a Happy Hour which in my opinion could provide the means for price adjustment. For now my favorite among the places in Red Rock Resort restaurant row will remain the Yard House.",

Very off-putting behavior. Ive been a server before and I would never say something like that to someone. Maybe try to upsell in a friendly way, perhaps?  My friend ordered the watermelon salad on the, \"Vegan Menu\". She asked if he wanted the feta cheese on it. He said no. It came on the salad anyways. Not a big deal really but the whole experience was not great with her as our server to begin with. Drinks came out slow, she came back every so often. The manager cleared the majority of our plates. He asked if everything was okay bit since its my friends birthday dinner, i didnt want to make a big deal out of it.  Service 4/10.",

I thought it would be darker, and maybe a little stuffy, but it was actually bright and open. The staff was very nice and professional. I started with the Apple & Quinoa Salad, which was delicious! From the Restaurant Week menu, I ordered the Crispy Calamari, the Hanger Steak, and the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding for dessert. The calamari didn't really have much flavor, and the sauces that came with it, didn't do much to change that. The Hanger Steak was good, but the temperature of the meat seemed a little cold when it was brought to the table. The fries that came with it were also good, and paired well with the steak. I'm not really a fan of bread pudding, but I thought this would be better since it was a glazed donut bread pudding. Not really much better. Softer than typical bread puddings, but still sucks all of the moisture from your mouth. The flavor wasn't bad, but it's still bread pudding. It was also better than the other choice, which was the Nutella Pizza. Tried a little of that, and that wasn't very exciting either. All in all, I enjoyed my experience, but it not enough to give it the extra star or two. I'll have to come back and try some different items, then perhaps I will update my review.",

Why do eating establishments need to have the music so LOUD you have to scream? Better yet, we asked the server if they could turn it down. You know what the MANAGEr said?.........wait for it...........LITERALLY SAID NO. So I would love for the manager to respond to this negative review (which should solely by on the MANAGER and not the eatery). So Mr. or Ms. manager, please tell me why you would NOT turn down the music? Not to mention, music should be something that's in the background, well unless you're at a CONCERT  Russell. I know you advertise live music. Again, it needs to be so loud you can't talk? This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm not old either.  Music doesn't need to be that loud no matter where you're sitting. That's ridiculous reasoning. Plus, the manager saying NO is a joke too. I'll pass on the free dinner. No desire to sit elsewhere, especially when you seriously think that music that loud is ok?  Won't ever be back because apparently your company thinks an inside concert in a restaurant is ok. You shouldn't have to YELL to eat. Do you?",

I came during happy hour and I have to say none of the food was worth coming back for. It reminded me of drunk bar food, the kind that's satisfying at 2am but not sober. I had crispy sweet potato fries that weren't crispy and the sauce was bland. Ordered a bottle of sparkling water which had no carbonation and my replacement was flat too. I had a sweetheart of a server but it took me 3 forks to get a clean one. Service and food could use some improvement but the problems here remind me of new restaurant woes and I hope they can iron them out.",

Our waitress Melissa was fantastic. She took the time to tell us about the specials. My husband has an allergy and she made sure everything we wanted to order was safe. My husband had the special Halibut and OMG it melts in your mouth!! I had the shrimp and grits and it was also really good. The must try has to be the Glazed Donut bread pudding, it is to die for. Thank you Russell and Melissa for making my bday dinner amazing. We will absolutely be back.",

Although the restaurant is large with a mix of cozy booths, high boys, tables and outside patio it feels very intimate. I felt like I was in a friend's kitchen. I came on a Saturday evening after 8pm and it was busy filled with locals. We were seated in a booth that faced the brick Oven where they make their pizzas. They had live music that helped to keep the energy flowing.   The food and service were great. I ordered the salmon and my babe ordered the New York steak. Our server, Rigo, was super friendly, observant, and attentive. I was torn between 3 dishes and he suggested the salmon. We also had a side of Mac n cheese that was delish. We didn't save room for dessert unfortunately, but I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I've been here a total of 3 times and each visit gets better but there's still room for improvement. Today is national lobster day and I saw an ad on IG with their famous lobster boil for $26 AND it's $1 oyster Wednesday too! I made an easy reservation via YELP for 8:30. I've been excited about their lobster boil all day.   7:30 comes around and I get a phone call that they ran out but still kept our reservation. We arrive there and the patio is packed, tons of people are standing near the bar but there was a lot of tables (in the center) still available. We were seated right away but the host didn't bring any menus.... we waited and waited. I almost walked back to the host stand to ask for menus but finally someone comes with menus. She didn't introduce herself and dropped the menus off but she did point out the beverage menu. Again we waited and waited. I had no idea the person who dropped off our menu was our server! Finally we were able to get some water and order a dozen oysters along with medium prime rib, mashed potatoes, Brussels and a medium cheeseburger with bacon.   The oysters are only $1 but they're on the small side. We've had better oysters but for $1 I can't really complain. We tried ordering another dozen oysters and our server said they ran out (this was at 8:45). Then minutes later, someone comes out with a dozen oysters and brings it to our table. We got confused because our server said they ran.... I guess miscommunication, we were able to get the LAST DOZEN. So, come EARLY for $1 oysters and any other special they offer because it looks like they run out quickly.   Prime rib ($29) was pretty good, a lot of fat but super tender and cooked medium like I asked. The horseradish that came with it wasn't super strong and the au jus was light and not salty which was good because the exterior of the prime rib was super salty IMO. But I'd order it again.   The sides that we ordered were delicious. Mashed potatoes ($7) were super super creamy and Brussels ($6) seemed to never end... which is a good thing because a lot of restaurants give such small portions of Brussels. I do wish however that it was a bit more crispy. The sliced apples on top provided a nice crunch/freshness. Our Brussels looked and smelled so good, the table next to us kept complimenting how good our food smelled and wanted to order the same thing.  Bfs cheeseburger ($17 +$3 bacon) was average. We weren't a fan of the \"plate\" it came on. Which was like a square board. The string fries kept falling off the edge.   Overall Hearthstone does have good food but service was a bit lacking. I love the decor and lighting but the music is super loud so I would not recommend it for date night unless you sit on the patio.",

The hostess was sweet, and sat us very quickly at a nice table, our Waiter was kind. BUT- the service was really slow. Everyone was super kind and attentive... you will never be out of water but your food will take forever. By the time our food arrived it was just barely above room temperature. We ordered an appetizer- bacon wrapped dates. They were not in the classic style. They had pork hidden inside the date and a marinara sauce on them!!!! They were NOT GOOD. My French onion soup was not good either. It smelled weird and had a layer of oil floating at the top that smelled burnt. It was also not as hot as it should of been. My husband ordered Prime rib. It came with no sides- that's extra$.... it also came to our table at room temperature!!!  In all honesty We both left with stomach aches.  Our waiter saw that I barely ate my soup -so he took it off my bill. That was kind. It's too bad the food wasn't good because -like I said the atmosphere was great and the staff were all really sweet but we won't be going back.",

Had a couple of glasses of wine, a glass of sangria and a dessert that was Nutella based. (See photo).  The sangria was ok. The dessert was just ok.  (See presentation) the dessert reminded me of glorified chocolate pudding and was though would be served warm, ended up being room temp.  In any case, the setting outside of the restaurant is amazing the service is good, this time though I was disappointed in the dessert along with the sheer price of the wine and sangria was ridiculous.  $20 for a glass of sangria was obnoxious to me.  (Red wine with a few slices of fruit)  Normally I am happy with hearthstone as their food, service and atmosphere is great.  This time I felt taken advantage of.",

I get better service at the McDonald's drive-thru on Rainbow and Lake Mead. No offense to those guys, just an honest observation.  Not in a hurry to come back if servers doing the bare minimum and just being an order-taker is the norm here.   I dislike writing negative reviews because I'd rather focus on positive experiences and would normally not even mention the bad places.

I started with the butternut squash soup what was accompanied by a little gruyere grilled cheese. This portion is def good for a lunch item by itself because I was almost too full for my entree when I was done. My fiance got the French dip which was amazing. It was served on a pretzel but and the Jus was perfectly salty. For my entree I ordered the truffle pasta hold the peas. The noodles we huge and a bit too al debate for my taste but nonetheless I would pour that sauce on anything. The only downside were the my side of Brussel sprouts came out after we were done with entrees and they opened the big partition from the outside without cranking the ac fan so it got very uncomfortable very quick.",

Happy hour menu is pretty decent pricing and the portions were good. Just the two of us, we ordered 4 dishes and some drinks to accompany and honestly could've done with just 3 dishes. But we were definitely not disappointed (albeit full).  The sweet potato fries stood out the most! Absolutely in love with the Greek yogurt sauce concoction! This is something I highly recommend getting. The hummus was my second favorite and another strong recommendation. It came with crisps to eat with and they were great.   We also ordered the pigs in a blanket which was very filling but my third favorite. Last was the pizza. Although it was delicious, I can't say it stood out compared to the rest of the items we ordered.    Our server Annie was extremely attentive and helpful as well so shout-out to her! She recommended some awesome drinks that I really loved (can't remember the name but I do know I got the blueberry Moscow mule like drink and one with elderberry). She's also super sweet--would love to have her as my server the next time I'm here!  Happy hour was not disappointing. Would like to come back here for a full meal or brunch next time!",

It's a nice place to try Around red rock casino if you don't want to go to a typical chain restaurant. Service here was great. I was a bit disappointed because the kitchen ran out of 2 dishes we previously ordered but they compensated and gave us a round of drinks on the house and a 20% discount. I felt that was very nice My server Al made sure we were taken care of. I recommend the DOC pizza, hanger steak, and short rib. Overall good experience, food is decent but I like that restaurant went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time.",

I didn't take off any tips because I could tell she was trying her best.  We were offered free hummus and chips for a yelp check-in.  But the waitress did it in a creepy way: she didn't proactively offer it to us when we sat down, instead, she pointed at my friend's cellphone with the yelp page and asked \"is that yelp? If you check in I can give you a free hummus.\"  Same waitress also dropped a knife in my friend's lap as she tried to set the table from between my friend and her baby.    We ordered: - Crab Artichoke Dip - I wasn't really impressed.  It felt like the crab and the artichoke were just mixed in after they were cooked separately, not cheesy at all. (I made sure it wasn't a dairy-free dip) - Truffle Mushroom Pizza - this was good, I'd order it again.  Not too fancy, exactly what you'd expect from a truffle mushroom pizza. - French Dip Sandwiches - the hip pretzel roll almost ruined this traditional dish! Other than the pretzel roll, everything else is good.  - Lobster Roll - I didn't taste it, can't comment on it - Vegan Pesto Zoodles - best item of the evening despite it being vegan. The pesto with the addition of the tomatoes cut the salt down and provided a very nice balanced flavor.  - Butterscotch Pudding - a bit too sweet for my liking but everyone else enjoyed it.",

There's also a patio, but nobody wants brunch outside in the Vegas summer. My friends enjoy the bottomless mimosas, but I'm not a big drinker, so I can't comment on that aspect. I had the chicken and waffles, which was good. The syrup was the right amount of sweet and the waffle was light and fluffy. I wish the chicken was actual pieces of chicken (drumsticks and/or thighs) rather than strips. At $18, it's a bit overpriced. Nevertheless, I used a coupon from the Stations promo book ($20 off $60), so that brought the meal closer to its True value. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "WATERMELON. AND FETA. SALAD.  Let me just lead off with that. A friend had introduced us to it before, but the moment our terrific waiter, Jeff, told us it was a special, I told him he need go no further. That would be the opening salvo for dinner, as far as I was concerned. And I was NOT disappointed. The addition of paper-thin slices of red onions added just the right note of spiciness, along with just a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper.  See there? Just THINKING about that salad got me so damned excited, I didn't go into how we came to have dinner at Hearthstone first!  As intermittent visitors to Red Rock for different dining experiences, we've had various impressions made...some very good, some less-than, (and yes, I AM looking at you, Libre.) The night we came to Hearthstone, we recognized that it was a place we'd passed by several times and been curious about, but never actually ventured in. This visit made us wonder why we'd waited so long!  Jeff was amazing as our server, and made sure that we were well taken care of. As I dove into my watermelon feta salad, (I still DREAM about it), Bear had his favorite, the tomato soup with a salami and brie grilled cheese on the side that was an outrageous-yet-fitting pairing. A single small taste and I swore that I would have it the next time we visited.   Next came the bacon wrapped dates for me, and the chorizo filling and piquillo pepper sauce added just the right notes of spice, heat and savoriness to offset the fruit's sweetness. We divided meatball and pepperoni flatbreads soon after that. I loved the meatball over the pepperoni, because the short rib-based meatballs were especially different...and yummy!  The main event for me was, hands down, one of the heartiest and best chicken pot pies I have ever had. I'm from the old school, and I remember when the 'best' pot pies as a kid were the Swanson brand, four for a dollar at the grocery store, with crust on the bottom, crust on the top and more on the sides. The buttery, golden, puff pastry top on this, however, told me that my 'childish' tastes were far behind me now, and I could be grateful for that. The steamy, creamy filling, studded with hunks of dark and light chicken meat and roasted veggies were a thing of incredible beauty that deserved to be photographed.  But my taste buds scolded me with \"ain't nobody got time for THAT!\" I surrendered to their whim.  Meanwhile, Bear had the fried chicken platter, but asked for and got mainly breast meat, which was impossibly juicy and tender, the way breast meat usually ISN'T at most places, with a tendency to be dry and overcooked.  With a fresh bacon-cheddar biscuit and all the other accoutrements though, there was so much there that he couldn't finish the platter, and ended up having to box up the remainder.  No problem, of course, because it made a scrumptious lunch for him a day or so later.   The laid-back, very rustic decor, the excellent service, the unbelievable food.  Hearthstone is definitely on our radar for another visit in the very near future, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great example of \"New American\" cuisine.",

That was important to me but everything else during my experience was awful. My girl friend and I went for Sunday brunch and our champagne took 15 minutes and then when the waitress brought our drinks, she walked right away and we hadn't even ordered food yet. She was extremely slow and seemed confused and disorganized which led to the awful service. I'm in the service industry and she was definitely not busy. The food took awhile to come out but when it did it was great. When we were finished, it took the server so long to come back to the table that I had to go up to be bar to order another round of drinks and I NEVER do that!. That also took quite awhile because the bartender was busy doing dishes and stocking them instead of paying attention to guests. I understand there is cleaning and upkeep involved throughout the shift but he kept me waiting to long when there were only 2 people at his bar and no drink tickets waiting to be made. After everything, we walked through the restaurant to leave and a group of our friends were actually leaving without getting their food because the service was bad (from another server) and everything was taking a ridiculously long time. It was interesting that we had different servers and different group sizes yet we had he exact same issues as each other. When telling this story to a relative, they also had a bad experience there for a special birthday dinner. This is just ridiculous. I will never be back to this restaurant unless they guaranteed that drastic changes have been made.",

Asked if we could be seated on the patio, and was told we could be seated there right away. Fifteen minutes later we were shown to a table right under two speakers. Ok fine, I'm old and like to converse quietly with my companion, not have to yell at each other.   Server came with menus and asked if she could bring water or mimosas. We opted for water, me assuming we could consider our drink options after perusing the menu. The hostess had mentioned a chicken sandwich served on a biscuit that was a favorite of hers, but I did not see it on the menu. The server came back and I asked about said sandwich. She had no idea what I was talking about. My husband ordered the egg croissant sandwich, only to be told they were out of that. Wouldn't it make sense to mention, as she dropped off the  menus, the items they were out of???  I ordered the nicoise salad. She did not ask if we wanted anything else to drink. After a few minutes I asked for a drinks menu, which she brought. The ladies at the next table were drinking a lovely pink concoction in a champagne glass. I asked what that was and was told it was a watermelon mimosa. \"Ohh, that sounds good\", I said, and was THEN told they were out of that too. Again, why not tell me you don't have an item before I orderr it???  As a consolation I ordred a glad of rose champagne, which finally arrived nearly at the end of our meal.   On the upside, the food was fantastic, no issues there. Just felt like the service was weird and awkward. Might go back again, might not.",

I ordered the Calabrian Shrimp Pasta & she asked me if I liked spicy & I said yes. It was nice & spicy how I like it & again a nice sized portion. Jennifer than asked if I was interested in dessert & I had to pass because I was happily stuffed. I will be back & ask Jennifer to serve me again!",

    "text": "I made a reservation via OpenTable; simple as always. Six of us got together (my friends like to call us the \"Supper Club\") and shared everything. I'd highly recommend a group because it worked out so nicely. The space is beautiful with a great vibe. However, all of us thought it was a bit loud as we had to yell at each other to have conversation.   Our server, Tien was FABULOUS! She was the epitome of the perfect server. She was very welcoming. Since we were all first-timers, she explained the menu, made food suggestions, and made sure we knew how much food was in each dish so we had enough for everyone. We really felt like she was looking out for us. She was present throughout our meal and even bought us two of their most popular desserts! As we were leaving, she offered to take a photo of our group as well. Tien went above and beyond her duties and made it a truly wonderful evening! Ask for her and you won't be disappointed!!  Overall, I enjoyed our meal. There were a few stand-out dishes that I would love to eat again. There were also items that warranted shrugs, however, I'm intrigued enough by what did well to want to try the rest of the menu.   Deviled Eggs ($9): Pimento cheese, whipped yolks, and Schmaltz mayo. Three to an order. These were good, but didn't taste particularly different from every other deviled egg I've had as of late.   Charred Octopus ($18): Smoked potatoes, rocket, and chorizo aioli. Fantastic octopus; well prepared. I loved the addiction of capers. The potatoes were nice as well.  FG&J ($18): Foie gras mousse, Virginia peanuts, and housemade jelly. Very yummy! The mousse had a wonderful flavor and was very smooth. Great with the jelly on their delicious grilled bread.  Baked Ricotta ($16): Truffle honey, black pepper, and gouda. This was definitely a favorite at our table. The ricotta was delicious! I loved the caramelization on top of the cheese and the side of truffle honey was a wonderful complement. Amazing with or without their bread.  Mushroom Flatbread ($20): Fromage blanc and gouda. A mushroom \"pizza\" with some truffle element. Nice crust. Nothing spectacular about this dish for me. Perhaps a different flatbread selection might wow me?  Whole Roasted Pig Rilette ($7): YUM. I liked that this rilette was a little meatier and the flavors were fantastic! I could eat this ALL DAY (I love rilette!).  Bone Marrow ($12): This was also good, but it didn't have any stand-out flavors. It was just plain ol' bone marrow. I didn't go back for a second bite.  Peanut Butter Lava Cake ($9): Butterscotch and Roasted Banana Brown Butter ice cream. The cake didn't interest me, but the ice cream was nice!  Butterscotch Pudding ($9): This was FANTASTIC. So yummy!! We couldn't get enough of it! And that Cookie Butter Crunch in it? Amazing. Home run.  Honey Olive Oil Cake ($9): This beautiful olive oil cake is drizzled (slightly drenched, but I'm not complaining) with honey and served with Blood Orange Sherbet and orange segments. SO GREAT! I absolutely loved this dessert. I may have loved it more than the pudding.",

    "text": "Yup, this gets 3 stars for being \"A-OK\" (according to Yelp's wording). It's exactly what it was. Went for brunch with another experienced diner today, and we had both been eager to try out this place. Due to some of the following experiences, it seems the restaurant could use some polishing.  Being that this was a business meeting, I wasn't registering some mishaps, nor did I want to deviate from the conversation. But, I left unsatisfied from the meal, womp womp:  The patio, where we sat, was quite lovely. (No wait today at 11:30 on a Sunday, but we had made a reservation.) The sun moved its way over over the course of the meal so I started working on a neck tan.  The waitress didn't come over for some time, and when she did, she got the job done. No frivolities. I barely got in my coffee order because she had taken my entree and didn't ask if I wanted any coffee or something to drink.  Menu looked great and I ordered the California Benedict and a coffee. My acquaintance ordered the salted caramel French toast. When the plates were presented, the dishes looked very appealing.  My coffee didn't arrive until two minutes into eating my entree, and the coffee, despite being poured from a server, was lukewarm. (After I asked to freshen up the coffee, there was a server who was attentive to my coffee needs.)  But both our entrees were lukewarm upon service (acquaintance had even commented on her French toast). My Benedict was ordered poached soft (oddly, the waiter seemed surprised that I was distinguishing the egg firmness), and it came out poached medium-hard. There wasn't enough Hollandaise to help soften the toasted English muffin. Half the potatoes were on their way to getting cold at the immediate outset of eating. Hey, listen, it's hard to talk business when you're crunching on your crispy English muffin, dry/shaved ham, and firm yolk.   I think someone who commented below said they really liked the Eggs Benedict they served up here... I'd like to invite them to Victoria, BC, the Land of the Most Amazing Eggs Benedicts... I had my expectations up because there are two EBs on the menu, and it's not a very large menu. The Hollandaise was just fine, but I would try ordering something else off the menu. (I think I just miss Victoria's Bennies. Sigh.)",

Food -Best Fried Chicken I've had in a long long time.  Juicy and moist inside with a crisp and tasty outside, perfection.  They also drizzle a little honey on top that really adds to the dish. -Gastropub is code for 'small portions but quality', that being said I felt that all our entrees had adequate food portion, and the quality was there.  Atmosphere -I was expecting the 'corporate hipster facade' but this place is more than that.   -It has a great energy and the live band was awesome.  They played pop standards but also mellowed them out a bit for a relaxed vibe.  I loved it.  Service -Someone wrote in a review that they only hire 'hot people' which can be a red flag sometimes.  While our server was not hard to look at she was also very informed on the menu and took great care of our party of 6. -Guy with water brought his A game that night.  My glass was always full.  I would highly recommend this place as it is one of the best dinning experiences I have had inside of a casino.",

    "text": "So I attended a private function here and afterwards decided to dine. Sadly it was one of the worst experiences. After waiting for 20 minutes for someone to greet the table, I was forced to flag down a busser and ask for my server. After another 10 minutes I had to go to the host stand and ask for someone. No one was there. So I went to the bar and asked the bartender. After another 10 minutes my server finally arrived with no apology for not coming to my table for the past 40 minutes. I should have left then, but wanted to give the food a chance as I glanced around the room and it did look and smell amazing.   I was not let down when I ordered the Butcher Steak Tartare and it was delicious. Very flavorful. So I was optimistic on my entree of the Hanger Steak.  I ordered it to be medium rare. It came out very rare. A cool jelly texture. Normally I can eat a slightly under cooked (or slightly over cooked) meat. I couldn't do that this time. An undercooked Steak is not nearly enough to give a bad review. It happens. I had to send it back. The server was very apologetic. What was bad was when they returned with my Steak. It had clearly been put back on the same plate, but that is not the worst of it. My fork that was on the plate when it went back to the kitchen was returned along with the used plate!  I am sure as the fork had a small piece or parsley from the potato that was on it when it left the table.   I was disgusted and refused to eat it. I asked for the manager who did remove it from my bill. What angers me is although he apologized, it was his complete lack of caring. He said that he was \"sorry I didn't like my Steak.\"  Liking it was not the issue, it was the fact that the same plate and utensils were returned. If this were my home kitchen, it would be different. This is a restaurant kitchen and I have no idea who touched my utensils, where they were placed or what was done to them while my meat was being cooked and put back on the used plate.   Rest assured that in addition to this review, a letter is being sent to the restaurant, Red Rock Casino and the Clark County Health Department.",

    "text": "We tried Hearthstone over the weekend for my mothers birthday celebration. Unfortunately we didn't order any steak, but we did have the prime rib, octopus appetizer, and Brussels sprouts slaw. The prime rib was good, but not amazing. It had an almost smokey flavor. The slaw was also good, but not grand because it lacked flavor. The show stopper was the octopus appetizer, which had a charred outside and soft inside. Paired with the sauce, it was exquisite! The martinis were wonderful, but it's a little difficult to mess up a dirty martini. I'm glad we had a coupon because I would have felt like I overpaid. The ambiance of the restaurant certainly made up for the food quirks.",

    "text": "I ate here on 1/21. The overall experience was horrible. I came here with many friends for my birthday dinner. I was initially impressed with the restaurant as the atmosphere is very nice and the servers were also nice. My experience quickly soured. Once my entire party arrived it took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks and appetizers. After 30 minutes our appetizers came out. We had ordered the meat and cheese platter, bacon wrapped dates, and the baked honey ricotta. They delivered two ricotta dishes to us and no dates. The dates took another 8 minutes to arrive. Our drinks arrived after the appetizers arrived. This was a common theme. We would order drinks and they would either be forgotten or arrive about 25 minutes later.   We all ordered our main dishes at the same time. When the main dishes arrived only half the table got their food. The table waited about 10 minutes for the other half of the table to receive their food. When it became clear that the other half was not going to receive their food the first half started eating. After another 15 minutes passed and having to watch half the people finish their plates we finally received MOST of the other half of food. I still had to wait another 5 minutes for my plate. 3 of us ordered the chicken (It was hyped up to be the best fried chicken 2 years running), The chicken was oily and very bland. Would not recommend.  After we all had received our food we did not see our server again for another 20 minutes. We then asked for our check and asked for them to be split the server initially said they could not split the checks. It took about 40 minutes to receive our check. when we did receive our check the server told us \"Sorry for the wait don't worry about tipping\". They had already added gratuity on anyway. It took another 25 minutes for them to cash us out. At some point during all of this a different server came in to apologize to us for the long wait. We asked to see the manager. The manager seemed disinterested and did not apologize to the group. Instead, he spoke to one individual in our group. It is my understanding that one dinner entree was comped from our check. In my opinion, the whole thing should have been taken care of.   I will never come back here again. Service is terrible. Food is overpriced and the manager Travis was very disinterested and seemed to want to just sweep the whole thing under the rug.   One more thing. We were seated in a semi private room off to the side. Throughout the night the servers kept coming into the room to grab supplies for other tables. It felt like we were sat in a room that was part storage room.",

But the service is just awful for no reason either. The place wasn't terribly busy and there seemed to be an adequate amount of staff but for whatever reason they were just not attentive to the tables. Everything came out in slow motion: 40 mins for a beer, 30 mins for wine and over an hour for food.   That wasn't the bad part though. We were waiting 30 mins just to get the check let alone pay for the bill. After everything came out slower than grass growing we asked to speak to the manager to discuss our experience. He came in briefly and turned around quickly when he heard us complaining to the server. I literally had to run after him to even talk to him. He apologized, but you could tell he didn't really care what I had to say.   After 3 hrs total at this place with terrible service, I will not return. Not sure where the 4 star service was today.",

He is the only one who shouted so loud and everybody was looking at him, yet the host lady sat us right in front of this guy. So we requested to be seated in another quieter corner again.  The host lady is friendly, but didn't pay much attention to what the customer really wants.   The restaurants is big and modern, it's a bit cucina enoteca-ish with a sport bar touch.   You needs to order the suckling pig one day in advance, so no roasted suckling pig for us.   -++ Wood roasted octopus: The octopus is a bit chewy, however together with the nice saba glaze and the other ingredient on the plate, it's a a hearty bites. It didn't wow me, but it wasn't bad either.   --+Carbonara pizza: The pizza smells great, the flat pizza wasn't very thin, the pizza dough is a bit thick and chewy, it's like eating New York style pizza. The pancetta is inedible, because of the extremely saltines. If the pancetta is fat, it could be a nice bite, however the pancetta is lean, that makes the meat overly salted. We needs to scratch off the pancetta from the pizza, it's a pity, because it smells really great.  ---Rotisserie chicken: The chicken meat was a bit powdery, but it's pretty juicy and tender, until we almost finish the chicken and we realized, the juicy and the tenderness of the chicken is not because of their cooking skill, it's because the chicken is raw. The chicken meat close to the bone, about half inch is raw.   We told the manager about it, she came and saw the chicken was almost \"finished\", she still charge us for the raw rotisserie chicken, because she thought we almost finished the chicken. Well, if I didn't dig into the chicken, how would I know the meat inside of the chicken is raw?  ---Clam with crushed tomatoes: The clam is fishy and tasteless. There is no salt in this dish at all.  And there is no tomato inside this dish, not even a piece of tomato skin. The manager did refund us the dish, because there is no crushed tomato in the dish.   --+ Heartstone secrets dessert: It looks fun, because the balls were black(soaked in berry juice) and it's topped with flower. It was pretty chunky and very sweet.    The service from the manager is off because the manager refund the money for the stale clams, but not for the raw chicken. The reason for not refund the chicken is because we almost finished the chicken. That's not logical.  If the chicken contain salmonella, the money to get a lawyer should be more expensive than the refund I assumed.   Not so smart!",

It's got a rustic ambiance, I think there were even shuffleboard tables in the back.  The waitress was very attentive and kept the carafes of mimosas coming.

I wanted to check this place out on our several past visits to Red Rock resort but never made it.   The bar was packed, which is good for business. They have lounge like communal seating; made me feel like I was just hanging at home or at a friend's house. The decor is cool as well. And I loved all of the TVs, no matter where you were seated you could catch all the action.   They have plenty of beers and cocktails to choose from. I wanted to try some food here but we were headed to dinner at T-Bones. Everything looked appetizing on the menu.   Our service was excellent. Jazmin was awesome! She was on her game, going around the bar area to make sure all of the patrons were good to go. She made some good recommendations for my wife's drinks. I kept it simple and went with some Stellas.

Otherwise this is another example of an extremely overpriced restaurant, who thinks they can get away with $40 pizzas (that are good, but not THAT good) just because they're inside the Red Rock resort.   Rock N Roll Wine nights are always fun, but really crowded. Their patio area is beautiful,  but overlooks the parking lot.  The wines are good. The food is good. The service is hit or miss. But what keeps us away is the pricing...You just don't get the quality or quantity that you should for the price.",

The potatoes are so yummy, and the benedict is very good... and you can't go wrong with a place that serves the mimosas by carafe so you aren't constantly waiting for more!  Ahmed was our VERY attentive and friendly server!  We will definitely go again.",

I believe they were going with a \"rustic/ Italian/ American\" kind of feel, but it honesty looked a bit clashing to my eyes when comparing the furniture. It irked me a bit. When the food came, I was disappointed by the portion sizes..  Then the food came and -drum roll- it was not bad and above average.  The staff was extremely friendly. No complaints, just positive remarks to them for their speed and personableness.   Good place, but has potential to be better!",

You like a great happy hour menu with food and drink specials on point? Check. This is hands down my favorite spot. I love their 1 dollar Wednesday oyster special. I love their complementary wine tastings on Thurs. I love that the chef walked up greeted me and offered assistance when I was looking for a spot at the bar and there were none. I mean can you imagine looking confused and the chef comes and talks to you?! Chris, you rock and your food is drool worthy. Every person you interact with is professional, attentive and totally sweet. My favorite waitress is Alex, hi girl. Last night for the kickoff of football season they brought out a whole pig and made everyone sliders to go with the 10 dollar blue moon pitchers and 10 buck endless hot wings. I could go on and on...just get here, trust me.",

There was live music which we weren't expecting, so that was awesome. The restaurant has a relaxed hipster vibe that we were obsessed with. Our upbeat and fabulous server Alex was very knowledgeable and made some really great recommendations.   We shared the Lobster roll, which was fresh and perfect, the shrimp cocktail, the Brussels sprouts salad and of course a couple of signature cocktails that were delicious! Everything was exceptional!!!! I only wish I could of had the lobster roll over and over again!  We are already planning a second visit because there were so many different things we wanted to try that sounded amazing! Can't wait to be back!   We also appreciated the fact that Management came up to us to make sure our evening was pleasant. Thanks Danielle! :)",

    "text": "It is so hard no to compare this place to a similar restaurant called Culinary Dropout (located in the Hard Rock). The ambiance, the style, the server's appearance, and the menu make you think (if you have been to Culinary Dropout) that these 2 places are related in someway. Anyway I decided to take my Mom here for Christmas dinner and I think I made a good choice. Made reservations (which I really dont think I needed) for 3:30pm, so kind of a late lunch/early dinner. Overall, was very happy with the experience. There were a few things that could have been better. We ordered Deviled Eggs as an appetizer (which were excellent by the way) but either the server forgot to put the order in, or thought we wanted them with our meal. Our entrees came out before the appetizer and we had to remind him that we ordered the appetizer. Once we reminded him they did come out right away.  Now on to the main entrees. My Mom ordered the fried chicken. The portions were huge (4 big pieces) and the skin was excellent. Good portion of cole slaw and a nice size biscuit accompanied this meal. And she ordered the \"Crispy Steak Fries\" as a side. There was nothing special about those, except the size. They are very thick. The menu states that they come with a smokey ketchup. I asked the server if that is the case and he stated it was just a regular ketchup. I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta, which consisted of braised short ribs, ricotta, natural braising juices, & piquillo pepper. My only complaint about this meal was the size of the pasta. It was too wide for my liking, but that is just me. It was about an inch in width, and long. You pretty much need a knife to cut it in to smaller pieces. But overall it had a great flavor. And to accompany this, I ordered the creamed corn. This was excellent. Just the right consistency.   What meal wouldn't be complete without dessert. I ordered the peanut butter lava cake. I would have preferred just a plain vanilla ice cream with this. It comes with a banana/brown butter ice cream. Just left kind of a weird aftertaste. But the cake, the filling, and whipped cream were excellent.  I would definitely come back. Maybe I'll try brunch should I do come back.",

My dining companion ordered a skirt steak special and thought it was delicious, however when he received the bill he had a little sticker shock. He asked me what I thought the price of his entree was and I said I don't know, $24? He said no, $42! We took our server's dessert recommendation and it was very enjoyable. Overall it was well worth it, we had such a nice time.",

    "text": "First off, our server, Kyle, was great and the staff makes every effort to please you.  Five stars for service!!  Unfortunately the food was awful!  The lollipop chicken wings were drowning in the buffalo wing sauce.  They may have been better if they just served them naked with a sauce on the side.  The mac & cheese was disappointing.  It was more like pasta in cream sauce that they baked.  It sounded really gourmet on paper but then it was just plain pasta with some sauce on it.  Tasteless.  The pancetta on the carbonara pizza was overcooked and the bottom of the pizza was soggy.  The grilled octopus was good but not memorable.  The  Moscow mule was not good (they need to try the one at the Yard House) and my husband sent it back along with the chicken wings.  (Yes, they were that bad!)   On a positive note, I got a free glass of wine when I checked in on Yelp and Chef Massie made a comeback with the secret dessert.  Three little donuts stuffed with cheese or something with a berry sauce that was perfect - not too sweet!!  I almost didn't order dessert because I just wanted to cut my losses and leave.  So glad we decided to try the dessert.  It was truly delicious!!  The atmosphere is open, airy & fun.  Loved the layout of the restaurant.  It would be a great restaurant if the food wasn't so bad.  Chef Massie needs to taste his food and rethink his menu.  I don't see this place lasting very long.  I started giving this place one star but changed my mind when I saw the effort that the staff was making and after trying the dessert.  Overall three stars because the service was excellent but the food was one star or less.",

Unexpected nice weather led them to open the patio without all the needed additional staff. We sat for quite awhile with no service. What is important is that when I brought it to someone's attention they immediately apologized and provided their usual great service - only better - and comped our entire brunch and drinks. Way above and beyond. Our server was Ahmed and he orchestrated all of this. Kudos to him for being a kind and good businessman. He turned what could have been a negative experience into an over the top positive that will keep us coming back and continuing to recommend this great restaurant to friends. Thank you Ahmed, for your amazing service and a wonderful dining experience. You made our weekend!",

And I can't forget abt $1 oysters ! Amazing ! Fresh ! My steak was so tender and paired perfectly with the aioli sauce .  I cant  wait to return .",

    "text": "I was excited to meet up with a fellow Yelper to try their Happy Hour menu.  We came in just as it was starting.  The bartender was very friendly and accommodating. Of course since they were just opening the area was clean, bright and open.    With a glance at the menu we pretty much knew what we wanted.  We decided to split the Baked Ricotta Toast, Steak Tartar Bites and Chickpea Chopped Salad.  Since all happy hour items are $6, why not?  The Ricotta Toast and Steak Tartar came out pretty quickly.  The delicious flavor of the steak tartar on a perfect wedge toast had amazing flavor.  The pickled vegetables & truffle toast combined wonderfully.  The Baked Ricotta Toast was good but not great.  I expected it to be a little more warm.    After we finished those two appetizers, we were sitting there for a while.  I finally asked the bartender about the salad.  She thought we ate it already.  When she came back she told us it was just sitting back there and no one ran it out.  Hmm. Strange that she would say that.  Again this salad was good but not great.    On our way out another waitress wasn't paying any attention which made her almost run into us.  Well, you would think she would say excuse me or something polite.  I guess my mother brought me up with different values.  The waitress was very rude mumbling under her breath with a look of disdain.    With that thought in my head, I left with a very poor image of Hearthstone.",

We like to come here on dollar oyster Wednesday's because they serve super high quality oysters for a price you can't say no to. They have a great red wine vinegar mignonette that I love with the oysters.  Like I said the food is great! Their Brussels sprouts side is amazing with the crispy bacon. Their truffle mushroom and truffle chicken pizza is a yummy appetizer to share. We also tried their special eggplant basil pizza which was good as well.   For main entrees I've tried the shrimp and grits which had great flavor but the grits were still kind of hard. Another time I had the rib eye steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare. My husband always gets the truffle pasta so I would say he thinks it's tasty. House red wine always good and they have a decent selection of draught beer if they didn't run out of the one you want already (which happens every time we've gone)  All in all great food, nice decor, friendly staff, but not somewhere you'd go to on a budget.",

The truffle pasta with peas was rich and creamy, great flavor, not greasy. Only thing I wish they would have served  bread with the pasta.

Happy hour ends at 7:00 PM. We asked to be seated and were told there was a wait and they wouldn't be able to seat us until 7:15. There were multiple open tables and it was made clear by the hostess that they weren't sitting us because of how close happy hour was ending... But whatever, we dismissed that and asked if we could hangout at the bar until our table was available. We waited about 15 minutes at the bar with no one asking us if we needed drinks. So we left into the casino and got drinks while waiting for our table.  715 PM comes around and we head back. Just of curiosity we ask about how much longer. The hostess said they were cleaning our table and we'd be seated soon.... LOL. 7:30 PM comes around and everyone around us had been seated (keep in mind parties that didn't have reso's that came AFTER us too). At this point we're all very patient seeing were familiar with the food industry, but this was irritating. We ask again about the wait.. It was very clear with the hostesses reaction they compelled skipped over us & forgotten us.  She apologized to us and said we'd be seated right away. So we waited... and waited. At this point it's 7:47 PM and we're just over it. So we left to a Public School, they were fantastic! While sitting there, they finally shoot me a call at 7:57 PM informing us of our table being ready....   We all understand things happen, wait times change, but there's also such thing as making sure the customer is well taken care of and informed on changes.....  Overall, we were excited to try a new place for our monthly meet ups, but were all highly disappointed with the service and the forgetfulness.  I definitely do not see myself giving this place a second chance with how terrible they went about things.",

However, both my husband and I enjoyed our food immensely. He got truffle pasta and beer. I ordered blackberry bliss and bacon wrapped scallops. Omg wow so much flavor! So filling too! I was concerned at the portion size at first because it only had 3 giant sized scallops (especially for the price at $32) but it was actually just the right amount and any more it would have been too much. It was cooked to perfection. Mmmmm so good. Can't wait to go back. Service was ok. But the food and drinks made it so worth it! I want to come back when they have live music.

We were a party of 6 and while we wanted to order more, our waitress only let us order 2 dozen oysters at a time so that the oyster bar wouldn't get \"backed up\". You can imagine how fast we finished it. I have gotten better sized raw oysters for the same deal at Oyster Bar in Suncoast so imagine my surprise when upon receiving our oysters, they were extremely small. We also ordered the steak tartare which was bomb. The poached egg and runny yolk was the perfect addition to the appetizer. I only wish they provide more toast with one order. We did extra order toast, but I actually didn't notice if they charged is for it. The other item we ordered was the Rockefeller oysters - at a whopping $4/each. I'm not too fond of cooked oysters, so they were alright to me, nothing special.   Ambience alone, I really wish I could give this restaurant 5 stars however, the food and the service lacked. The service here was terrible. Between the 6 of us, we ordered 3 entrees all with side dishes. All of the entrees came before the side dishes, forcing us to wait while our food got cold. No exaggeration, myself and my boyfriend waited at least 10 minutes before our potatoes came and by that time our prime rib was cold. At a restaurant that wasn't too busy, we spent almost 3 hrs with majority of the time waiting for something we ordered.",

    "text": "Since we were staying at Red Rock hotel, we could've had a choice of any property restaurants to eat at but chose Hearthstone because their menu looked good. We made reservations for 7pm & arrived a bit early. No one was at the hostess stand near the back of the restaurant (where the open patio seating is located) so we waited & waited & waited. Finally flagged down a waiter to get someone to help us. This should've tipped us off that this was not going to be a good dining experience (the restaurant was not even busy!). Finally got seated in the patio area and again waited and waited for at least 15-20 min until our server brought over menus to us (You would think the hostess would give menus to us when we sat down?!). The waiter apologized & said there were issues with the kitchen, etc...(but as a guest, we didn't really need to know what their problems in the kitchen or service were). He explained the menu, let us know the specials, & got our drink orders. Drinks came promptly but the meat & cheese board was a bit slower. When we got the meat & cheese board, it had 3 small slices of raisin toast & our waiter said that he would bring us more. Did we get more toast? Again, we waited and waited (we didn't want to eat up all of the meat & cheese before the toast came). The toast never came until way after we received our entrees (defeats the purpose of having an appetizer) & after we talked to the manager.    FOOD - The review got 1 star for the fried chicken (4 pieces) was good (crunchy with a slightly sweet taste) and the cheesy biscuit (fluffy & moist). The apple slaw was bland & tasteless so that was not touched beyond the first taste. - I ordered the Hanger steak (medium) with steak fries (which turned out to be matchstick/shoestring fries). Meal was served on a cast iron plate but the entire meal was lukewarm (as if it sat too long waiting for it to be brought to the table) and the steak (served sliced) was medium rare. I ate a few pieces on the ends that were on the medium but couldn't eat the more rarer parts.  - My daughter ordered the cheese pizza & it was the worst pizza ever. Too much cheese which separated from the pizza dough and it was oily & rubbery (again not hot and because it sat there too long, the cheese turns into a rubbery mess!). I told my daughter to stop eating it (she already eaten 2 small slices) because she would have a stomach ache later on from the oily cheese.   The manager, Danielle, came by to check on us and I told her about all of the problems we had with the service & food. I gave her an extra star for trying to make it right even though it was a little too late. She was apologetic and thanked me for telling her. She immediately took the pizza & steak & brought back a new steak (this time, the steak was cooked medium and both steak & fries (again not steak fries) were hot). We ordered mac and cheese for my daughter & this also came hot. We got the steak comped & desserts on the house, which we thought we would get to choose but they brought over two desserts for us. One was a chocolate lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (which was overcooked since the \"lava\" didn't ooze out) & the other was peanut butter lava cake (which the server paired with chocolate ice cream instead of banana ice cream, as noted in the menu). The chocolate one was better than the PB but two lava cakes as dessert? One couldn't have been a different dessert of our choice? We left more than 3/4 of each dessert untouched because by then, we were DONE with this restaurant!    Do NOT go here unless you want to be ignored or have all night to sit & wait for service and if you want your food to not be brought to you hot. There are tons of better restaurants to eat at on and off the strip (see my review for Echo & Rig) where you could spend your hard earned money on. Wish it was better as our trip was for my husband's birthday.",

The Baked Truffle Ricotta with truffle honey and the butcher steak tartar with a poached egg appetizers are phenomenal. Masterpiece!  Watermelon, avocado, arugula and feta cheese salad!? So delicious. A must try, hands down. The Abe froman wood oven flatbread is our favorite pizza on the menu. Sausage, buffalo mozzarella cheese and caramelized onions. Nicely put together by chef Enriqoe and fantastic taste. The hanger steak and scallops are my favorite entrees. Very rich and flavorful dishes. Service is always great, everyone is always friendly and welcoming. We have a great time every time we come to Hearthstone. They always feature wine tastings on Thursdays, 50% off on bottles of wines on Mondays and live music on the weekends! This place is DOPE!",

And 80s music playing in the background. Also a ton of TVs. We had 2 servers. Both were pleasant, knowledgable about the menu, and were always accessible. Excellent service. The food: we ordered a couple of shared plates...ricotta bake with honey, wild arugula salad, and lobster polenta. Oh man, the lobster polenta was so creamy. AmaZing. I also ordered the entree Rotisserie Chicken with arugula salad. It was tender and moist and had great taste. For dessert we shared the Peanut Butter scotch Lava Cake. Wow! I'm full.

Ambience, food, and staff friendliness were excellent. Please work on service because for the amount of workers running around, not having good service is suprising. I appreciated the diverse menu-can come here more often, not just when I'm in the mood for one specific cuisine. Really liked the sofas and shuffle board located inside. It's a great place all around.  We ordered off the meats and cheese menu. Prosciutto was very good, braesola-never delivered, Cremont and cheddar cheeses were excellent, honey and other spreads were excellent. Would have been nice to have more bread come with it for the amount we ordered. Mac and cheese, squash were excellent. Pizza was great. Hamburger was good.  Will return and try again.

Lots of great small plates to share.  The meatballs put grandma on watch.  The flatbread are amazing. Grilled octopus that was prepared to perfection. A carving board that was different and a great choice.  Stuffed dates that were to die for.  We didn't have a main course but they looked delictable.  A huge variety of beers on tap and in bottles and great cocktail menu.  A must!",

    "text": "Met 2 friends for dinner on a Thursday  6:00. Service was bad. Tried to order one bottle of wine. It was not available. Then a alternate also not available. Fortunately, 3rd choice was. Waitress verbally recited 2 specials. One being lamb chops. Said it was a huge portion of 36 ounces.  Realizing she said 3 chops it was probably three 6 oz chops. Which is what it was. Reasonable portion but not 36 oz. Staff is not trained well. Polite but aloof. We all three ordered 4 appetizers. Wings, 2 orders because waitress said they were small. She was right about that. Octopus was slimy and not fresh. Dates were good, again very small portions. Salad order only came out for 2 of us. Waitress no where to be found. Even server delivering dropped salad and ran without asking if we needed anything. Other salad eventually came out with dinner but we had to ask for it. Bus person wanted me to keep my fork after appetizer. No place mat. I guess I was supposed to put dirty utensil on table or just hold it. No check back until dinner was over. This place was more than half empty.  Service is below par because of what appears lack of training. This was my second visit. Friends also stated similar experiences from their past visits. Lamb was very good and a reasonable portion more salt than I prefer though. Friend said salmon was the saltiest he ever had. Will not return. The value is not there. When service is bad the desire to return is lost. It's too bad because the place is a beautiful environment.",

It's my \"go to\" when I want to grab a great dinner, when I want to get friends out together. The lounge, they even have shuffle board! Yes, shuffle board! Such a Classic touch! All time favorites have to be the charcuterie menu (cured meats & cheese), butcher steak tartare, baked ricotta, braised short rib meatballs, pepperoni pizza (add the sausage from the Abe Froman), wood oven roasted clams are so delicious (that sauce is ridiculous). If you're a fan of shellfish the Grand Shellfish Plateau is the business! Shrimp pasta is my personal favorite as far as entrees are concerned. Oh and getting a side of the lobster polenta along with the grilled broccoli. To top things off the peanut butter lava cake and a their house-made pistachio ice cream amazing! They're both change your life good! Coming back for my birthday in March to have their Suckling Pig Beast Feast! If you haven't been here you HAVE to check it out. Red Rock just got a huge facelift with this place! Thank you Hearthstone!",

But $25 for a small bowl of pasta which is approx 15 noodles and 4 pieces of small shrimp, that leaves you wondering what exactly you are paying for. Well its the ambiance...its a beautiful setup, but like everything else at the red rock, poor execution. The guy standing there making pizza, hasnt even a smile to spare, while he barehandedly tosses the dough and pulls the order receipts then tops pizza. Fingers crossed, he washes his hands thoroughly. I find the menu a bit over zealous for a local eatery or a low key mid scale hotel. And seeing an entire baby pig roasting for viewing pleasure made me want nothing more than to become a vegetarian. Overall once this place has seen most of its locals a time or two, im not sure who they will keep coming back. Perhaps they can succeed on the one time hotel guests alone.",

    "text": "Please think twice about going to this restaurant.  My boyfriend and I were always curious to check out this place because we are locals and we pride ourselves in finding new places to eat and check out. Hearthstone had a very attractive menu and we always pass it whenever we would go to the movies.  I had dropped off my son to go find parking, this past Sunday. We were going in for brunch and we needed a good place to eat. I parked and went to the front door. My son was still standing there waiting by the wall and when I had asked him if he got a table, he said he tried but the hostess \"looked busy.\" I saw NO ONE around and the hostess was playing around with her computer and she heard me and quickly defended herself, saying she didn't see my son and that it was busy. I asked her why it took her for me to say something out loud in order for her to ask us if we were being helped. She disregarded my question and DID NOT even apologize! She was rude, unkempt and to shut me up with my questions and wanting to get rid of me, she said I can seat you now. She did not introduce herself either.  I was already upset at this point because my son was disregarded and we sat down proceeded to order. Again, no name from the waiter (he was a bald headed gentleman) and he took awhile to get our menus and drinks. The place was not even busy! He did not recommend anything or ask if it was our first time there. You can clearly tell that he wasn't interested in explaining anything in the menu because when  had asked how the meat, cheese, and bread platter worked, he just said \"you just order it to whatever you want.\" I asked him for a recommendation, he said, it depends on what you want and just read me the menu (which I could have done myself). I had mentioned that I wanted to order two types of bread and when all our food came, I had asked him about it, he said, \"Oh, I thought you were just asking about it.\" Um, isn't that the whole point? I ask for the bread and hopefully I get the bread?  The couple next to me was having the same ordeal as myself and was not happy with their order. I saw them sent back their order TWICE and they were still not happy with it. I saw the manager, who's name was Aienrry, and requested to speak with him.  He was very nice and accommodating, kept asking what I would like for him to do, I wanted the name of the hostess because she needed to be educated and trained in customer service. He slyly avoided giving me her name by giving me his card and saying he would email me to compensate for the lack of service that my son and I received, by coming by again for dinner. After such a negative experience, I do not know if I ever want to come back to a place such as this! I still have yet to receive an email and do not plan on coming back. It's so sad that a beautiful space such as this, runs an unprofessional restaurant and lacks customer service.  My boyfriend and I experience new restaurants every week and we recommend places to our friends who come in from out of town. We will not be recommending this place to any of our local or out of town friends. Do yourself a favor, please do not come to this place. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Four of us had a nice dinner & service was both friendly & attentive. Our tab over $325 + tip for drinks & several small plates, no entrees. The only reason I don't give more stars is because 1.) the seating throughout is not very comfortable, all small scale Danish bentwood loop armed chairs, tight for larger framed persons, even the thin teeny tiny guests looked huge in these chairs. I noticed. I could not imagine wedging myself into one of those chairs or barstools. While the side booths were comfy, thank goodness, they were U-shaped so difficult to hear from end to end with our party of four and the bustling atmosphere. How guests climb into those high barstools then scoot them up at the center sharing tables is beyond me? They cannot be comfortable. The lack of comfortable seating via armless chairs is a huge design flaw in an otherwise hip interior space. It's like flying economy at first class prices. 2.) we shared many plates yet were not provided with any serving utensils, extra clean plates, or plates to put our discarded seafood shells off our main plate. So we had to double dip each using our own used silverware. Good thing we are close friends without colds. The sauces left from the first served sides, like runny oyster water, mixed on the dirty plate and wetted the crust of the later served sides like flat bread pizza, which was not a good thing. I consider this a major oversight in dining propriety & service. 3.) portions were small for the price, and we were not offered bread. My husband made a sandwich when he got home....",

    "text": "I came here last weekend with a group of friends for my birthday. We were seated on a couch, a few chairs and 1 big cushiony chair. Really odd mix of furniture and I didn't like having to sit coffee shop style with a coffee table as our table. I was hunched over the whole time trying to eat my food. There seems to be a very common theme to everyone's reviews and that's how horrible the service is. I have to agree, the service is absolutely horrendous. We had this younger girl serving our table with her tits practically hanging out. We had to hunt her down throughout the entire restaurant just to get some refills on waters. The bottomless bellini deal is a sick joke. $24 and they get refilled whenever you can find your waitress and ask for it. If you're not on top of it they will never come back and give you more. The food was the redeeming factor. We ordered a bunch of random things and they were all pretty good. I ordered steak and eggs, they come with pan fried potatoes and onions. While the steak was good, the potatoes were over cooked and hard. My friends ordered the French toast which was good just really really sweet. We also ordered some fries which are these enormous potato wedges that you can literally put back together to form the potato. They were so thick cut that I cut one in half and could pour out the inside and make mashed potatoes. We had to hunt down our waitress for ketchup. We ordered the charcuterie plate and I have to say it was pretty delicious. I asked for the pickled veggies, truffle honey, couple of different hams and cheeses. It does not come with nearly enough bread. We were a table of 7 and she brought us 4 pieces of toast. The Bellini's were pretty craptastic which now makes me think it was probably a good thing she didn't fill them up often. I honestly have no idea why this girl was working as a server. She had absolutely no personality, in fact she was borderline rude. We mentioned several times that we were celebrating my birthday and she never once acknowledged it, no happy birthday, nothing. I don't know that I will ever come back. The truffle honey is to die for but there were too many negative factors. They have so much potential to be excellent but the servers they have are going to run this place into the ground.",

Not a big deal, we enjoyed the bar and our table was ready about a half hour later.  Our server was adorable and bubbly, we love the decor and menu options.  We ordered the seafood platter for $90, it was very fresh, but I felt for the price there should be more.  I'm comparing the Hearthstone platter to smith and wollensky on the strip, which for the same price blows it out of the water! I was a little put off with price to food ratio, but the chef sent out a few complimentary dishes, which I felt made the platter a little more palatable. The steak tartare was to kill for and the pizza was amazing too.  I love the draft beer selection and the shuffle board tables.  Overall, despite the reservations and the over priced seafood platter I will be back.  We actually tried to make reservations for last night, but we're told they were full. I can't be mad because the place is really that good.  We were able to get in at wolfgangs next door at downtown summerlin and we had an equally good experience.",

First, \"Roasted Artichokes\" for $15 turned out to be 3/4 of a very small artichoke bottom, on top of cooked parsnip cubes and fried scallions.  You could buy 20 small artichokes in a store for $15.  There were more parsnips and scallions than artichokes, but no mention of them on the menu.  \"Lollipop Chicken Wings\" for $18 was just so-so.  10 tiny drumettes, drowning in a spicy, creamy sauce, with 4 raw veggie sticks.  \"Black Truffle Hangar Steak\" for $33 is an ordinary tasting hangar steak with 4 potato logs.  Couldn't distinguish truffle in the steak or sauce.  Not sure we would want to go again to try other menu items since this meal for 2 people with 1 alcoholic drink and 1 iced tea was almost $100.",

The first time I went, I didn't have a reservation and she tried to sit us a community table, even though the place was empty. Second time I went I had a reservation, and still didn't get seated for almost 20 minutes after the reservation. The place was almost empty again. The waiter said that they want to be the neighborhood spot for locals, so if that's the case, they should let the hostess know not to seat people without reservations at such a bad table. I'm sure that they'll work out the kinks soon and have the place flowing properly though. It's defiantly worth it just for the food.",

    "text": "The vibe here is loud and echoey but friendly. It's eclectic decor reminds me of the beach, France, the northwest and Swedish grandmas basement. All good things that I'm not sure go together. When you walk in from the casino side it has a vintage feel, when you sit down it feels like a seafood restaurant in oregon. Then, he menus has mostly steaks as the main meals. I'm saying all this in a positive light because it needs to be explored. I had crab cakes that were cold, wet and very very tart with lemon juice. Served on little toasts. Crab meat was plentiful. The tomato bisque very very good but tepid. I was so hungry and it was so good I didn't send it back. It was like they added the cream last and it cooled it off because corners were warmer. I would order this again! My husband got the meatballs and I ordered the macaroni and cheese. He ate them so fast so apparently it's a winner he said moist but not greasy. I would not get that mac again. The noodles are small and chewy and not of the macaroni size. They used chopped nuts instead of bread crumbs on the top and all it did was throw off the taste and texture. It also was like cheese soup with noodles floating in it. I took it home to see if the flavor would blend better later and I wouldn't order this again. My husband also had the burger and fries and said they tasted great. The service is amazing and the staff is friendly. We want to go back as the oysters were calling my name.",

The mushroom pizza and artichokes have the perfect combination of flavors along with everything else on the menu that's delicious! Cocktails are on point... Try the Pimm's 50 and the My Boy Bleu! I'm so happy we finally have a new spot in Summerlin to hang out at that isn't just your typical \"bar\" spot. OH! And they also have shuffle board! I can't wait to go back ASAP!

    "text": "Well, where to start. I came here to dine with some business partners much to my hesitation but they really wanted to dine here so we did. What a mistake. The food is not the problem, it is the service! The hostesses while young and very pretty are dressed like they are going to a night club and they are not very friendly. Unprofessional. We waited to be sat around 20 minutes although we had a reservation. Once we finally sat down, Tori was our server but I wouldn't call her that. She was very curt, uninterested in going over the menu, and she never came back to our table. A different server brought us our food and drinks,  and another brought us our check...weird. The food was fine but forgettable and really full of salt, I guess that is how they got us to buy so many drinks. The worst part of my experience was audibly hearing the chef yelling and cursing at the line cooks. How unprofessional for your guests and I feel bad for the staff. You can tell nobody cares in this place and I can't say I half blame with the way I witnessed/heard the staff being treated. The management team needs to spend some time on their skills as leaders because yelling the way whoever was yelling at the staff needs to be re-evaluated as an effective leader. I have never experienced this at any restaurant, including fast food, let alone what is supposed to be an upscale/ fine dining experience. Needless to say my business partners felt like crap for suggesting this place and we most definitely will not return. We do suggest Mercadito right next door though!",

    "text": "I don't quite understand this place.   I couldn't figure out the theme, the decor, the music - nothing.  I ordered the Kale Caesar Salad that was described as having cheese, croutons, and garlic lemon dressing.  When I took the first bite,  it tasted like straight anchovies.  I know that CLASSIC Caesar salad dressing has anchovies.   However,  the menu didn't say anything about it being a classic Caesar salad nor that the dressing was classic.  I sent it back and ordered the onion soup.  It smelled like something died in my bowl.  Disgusting.  I ordered the shank steak and it was actually pretty good, however, the steak fries had some creamy drizzle on it and was not good.  My husband ordered the Sea Bass and it was horrible. The service sucked,  too.  The outside of this restaurant boasts it to be a fine dining establishment especially when you look at the prices.  Yet, when I walked in,  I couldn't figure out why they had big screen televisions playing basketball and the music was flashback to the 90s.  I was subjected to listening to Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughtta Know\" and \"Zombie\" by The Cranberries while trying to eat.   Is this fine dining, a sports bar, a steakhouse, what??  Everything about this place confused me.  I'm sure it will be closing in the next few months since the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night.  Don't waste your time or money.",

We started off with a pastry basket which was just lovely, filled with some small fresh danishes, banana bread, and fresh bread with a beautiful maple butter. I then ordered the two eggs any style which comes with potatoes and toast and my friend ordered a croissant with ham and cheese and egg and bacon along with hashbrowns. Everything ordered was absolutely delicious. The hashbrowns came with applesauce that was freshly made in the house as well as ketchup and butter on the side. We had bottomless Mimosas which were really good and made it that much more fun. Another friend got the bagel and salmon breakfast which was crazy good and very fresh as well as a fruit bowl which was easily one of the best fruit bowls I have ever tasted, showing up with a cantaloupe that was sliced along with beautiful berries marinated in their own juices to create a sweet and beautiful taste. The service was top-notch with very friendly people and very fast and efficient. It was a wonderful experience and we are totally going back. It doesn't hurt that the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a beautiful light air feeling to it as it is large and spacious and it is packed with people having a good time. The restaurant also has an outside area. Reservations are wise and I would recommend them.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar. Came here for their $55 Thanksgiving dinner, left unsatisfied and disappointed. The Thanksgiving menu was a 3-course prix fixe. First course was butternut squash soup or roasted beet salad. No complaints here. Butternut squash soup was good, actually the best part of the entire meal. Roasted beet salad was nothing special, but wasn't bad either. Then the meal started to go seriously downhill. Main course was organic herb-roasted turkey with gravy, mashed potatoes, creamed green beans, and sourdough stuffing. In all honesty the turkey wasn't overly dry and the gravy was tasty. Standard mashed potatoes and stuffing, substandard green beans. What really irked me was the portion size, especially for a $55 set menu. This was closer to a kid's meal or appetizer in terms of portion size - very disappointing, especially for a holiday synonymous with gluttony (actually left hungry and I'm not a big eater). Then came dessert: pumpkin spiced cheesecake or apple pie. Little did I know the desserts would make the portion size of the main course look enormous by comparison. The desserts were practically bite-sized, literally the size of the desserts you see at the dessert bar at Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. Even with all of the above, I wouldn't have felt the need to come to Yelp and leave a two-star review if the service was even acceptable. My drink was never once refilled for the entire meal, even though the server clearly saw an empty glass when bringing the main course, dessert, and extra silverware or when he came to clean empty plates from the table multiple times. He actually DID come and grab my empty glass after I had already finished dessert, but that was not to refill it apparently as I never got a refilled drink and the only time he returned to the table after that was 5 minutes later to bring the check. And a different server bumped into me, dropped a used, dirty fork on the table in the process while muttering an insincere \"sorry\" as he scurried off. Seriously?  For $55 +$4 for my drink, I feel like this meal was way overpriced and that's not even taking into account the terrible service throughout the meal. You can definitely get better food AND service for $70+/person. Will not be back.",

Of course it is Sunday and the games were on, which complimented the atmosphere as if I were at a tailgate while surrounded by games.  I owe my experience to Allie, who was phenomenal with her services and recommendations.  She even knew their best vegan choices, which blew me away, as her depth of the menu was exceptional.  Kudos to Allie and Carlos for making our experience a memorable one, we can't wait to go back to HearthStone!!",

    "text": "To start, the decor at the restaraunt is amazing. It is very rustic and homey. It feels as though they had large sliding doors they just push open onto a nice patio area. I really like to come just hang out here for drinks to soak in the atmosphere. Depending on what day you come, you will see a bunch of total white washed summerlin yuppies super dressed up thinking they are all that and a bag of chips. Quite entertaining. Or you can find the average Joe- but I did notice a lot of really white people.. So anyways. Haha   The bathrooms are outside to the right in the casino, kinda annoying no bathrooms in the location but at least it is not too far. They also have a semi large room with a private table for large parties you can reserve that looks fun.   The food here is fresh and fun. A bit high on the price point for my liking. Entrees including streaks run from around $33 to $55. I got the $50 something dollar filet that was supposed to be 10 ounces and by the time I cut off the bone, it was a 6 oz steak. It also does not come with sides so you have to order a $10 side to make it a meal(3 sides to choose from). The showstopper of the night was their watermelon salad which may be seasonal. The feta with the nuts and sweet melon made my mouth sing. The peanut butter dessert recommended my the waitress was also Delish.   Service was very slow. Waited about 20 minutes initially even to get a drink. We were not in a hurry really but it was annoying to wait that long initially. Just give me my drink and I'll wait for food. But I need my drink! Overall, don't think I would eat here again cause just too expensive for what you get. The food was great though!",

It's obviously very hard to have bad mimosas as there's literally two ingredients but I didn't feel like the service was great, it was average and for the price of the food it really didn't feel like service was up to par. We had to ask twice to be refilled and even then that took a while. I try to be considerate that theyre busy and there are other tables but when I can see them not working and purposely not making eye contact that's when it becomes an issue.

    "text": "The service is super friendly and it really does feel like a home kitchen where everyone's family and just kinda hanging out. I got the shrimp pasta and i was dipping my bread in it. I asked for vinegar & oil for my bread and the server went out of his way to get it for me. I noticed most tables had pizza and it looked like everyone was a couple. The food you could tell was of a high quality. Only downside I'd say about the food is some meals come with fries and some if you want a side you have to pay a lot. Sides are overpriced but the rest the food is prob just about right price wise. I had originally come to eat at libre next door and sadly it's gone so I tried hearthstone instead. If I was staying in Vegas I'd totally come back. The parking is kind of difficult but their is a valet area. Theirs outdoor seating with misters & a nice water fountain. Theirs sadly no actual bathroom you have to go into the casino for that which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Theirs a step area that is part of the booths that could cause someone to trip so if you have family or friends who are clumsy like me I'd suggest sitting not at the booths. Also the booths you sit so far apart to talk so prob if theirs just two of you get a smaller table. The music is nice and at about the right level. And the lighting was good even for a date type place at night you could still read the menu & see each other but it wasn't so bright as to be blinding. I'd recommend but prob not the asparagus.",

There's build your own pizzas on the kids menu and they even have board games and big coloring books with thick crayons for them to enjoy- top that off with regular kids' brunches and activities and they've got a major score from this local momma! The atmosphere is great too... really amazing decor/vibe. Sort of like a contemporary farmhouse feel to it. The cocktails are on point and Sundays are half off pizzas (yes, including on the kids menu!) Ask for Gerson when you go to Hearthstone... he gives top notch service and is great with kids!

I'm literally dying of starvation at this point. and on a serious time crunch. we ate the comped dozen and the lobster and left.  I don't understand how an establishment like this lets something like that happen. we were not the only ones waiting for food. everyone around us were waiting as well. massive breakdown in the kitchen along with overbooking tables and not holding the door will result in a disastrous dinner service  on the up side - our server was james and he was great. I had a ton of questions and he was very accommodating in between rushing to each table, making sure everyone had what they needed and pacifying irritated customers.  they dozen oysters we got to taste were great. very fresh and succulent. lobster was rushed and not completely done. inside was runny with tons of uncooked liquids.   service and oysters were great and we will try again. maybe come a little earlier.",

    "text": "To be very clear, this review is strictly for the Thursday night wine tasting.  They've been having it since they opened, or almost, but this was the first opportunity we've had to try it out.  I've checked out the menu outside the restaurant lots of times, but knew early on that this wasn't our kind of place.  I'll eat almost anything, but actually am not enticed by 90% of what they offer.  My husband is much harder to please (if it's not spelled c-h-i-c-k-e-n, he's outta there.).  That, and we both find the prices over the top.  But we wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, so we dipped our toes in.    If I had to rate Hearthstone for ambience, I'd give it a 4, maybe even a 5.  Light, airy, spacious, industrial but warm, comfortable.  It was interesting - and rare - to see most of the attractive booths unoccupied and many more people choosing tables.  The patio was nice, too, and the lounge section is completely open to the patio.    We were given tickets for two wine samplings each, 2 oz pours - a sauvignon blanc or, I think, a pinot grigio.  We chose the white.  I don't know what the heck was in that wine, but before I finished the first sample, I was buzzed.  By the second, I had to seriously take stock of whether I was capable of driving home!  Yeah, I've never been accused of having a hollow leg, but this was unprecedented.    There were also supposed to be passed appetizers, but they didn't materialize.  Instead, more than an hour into the two-hour gig the group of three next to us was served a buffalo mozzarella flatbread.  The wine-tasting wasn't crowded, but for the next 20 minutes, nobody else was given anything.  Finally, a waiter appeared with flatbreads, and all of us had something to stave off the potent wine.    I had high hopes, but we weren't blown away by the pizza.  The mozzarella was too chewy, and the crust too salty.  We'll stick with the one at Kona Grill, whose HH flatbread is less than half the price.  I wanted so much to love it, but alas, I didn't.  Maybe the real food is better, but again, that menu is not singing to me.",

The Bellinis were pre-made and served from a pitcher. They tasted more like peach juice and hardly had any champagne. The bottomless bloody beers were nothing special. I would prefer bottomless bloody Mary's or bottomless mimosas like the other local restaurants who serve brunch. The $70-75 for a bottle of vodka or bottle of champagne to make your own drinks was overpriced. The staff was friendly, but unorganized and slow.

The service from the moment we walked in was top notch.  They use a team effort approach for service with the server (ours was Jessica) and their runners.  The only two downside we experienced was when we offered and then ordered the stone crab special and were later told they were out of stock the second was our favorite part of their menu had been taken off due to not being popular enough.   The meat and cheese boards are no longer offered with their fantastic spreads and jams.   I really hope they bring this back!! Overall we had a romantic dinner and were sat away from the visitors there to watch the game. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I chose this restaurant to entertain business guests. Nice open room. Good atmosphere and energy. My pan fried bass special was good as were the fresh oysters and smoked meats and cheeses. However, the overly zealous servers and bus staff took every opportunity possible to swoop our unfinished plates away. Incredibly, we almost lost 6 uneaten oysters (at $40/dozen) until I defended ourselves as these precious mollusks were almost lifted away. The pressure to eat fast dominated  the meal. I knew not to put down my fork for fear of losing my entree. Notably, my complaints had absolutely no impact on the uneasy and frenetic pace...almost as if a strict task master was standing in the wings demanding that we get the bums rush in order to quickly turn the table. At the suggestion of our server, we ordered two \"amazing\" deserts to share. We began nibbling when one guest had to leave. We stood up to let her out of our booth and to say goodbye. You guessed it. Before we could sit back down and with our backs turned, our nearly untouched desserts were expertly whisked away. I ended up with an odd sense of emptiness that seemed out of sync with the hefty check ($100/person). In the spirit of full disclosure, the manager did stop by to apologize explaining that the restaurant was only 18 months old and that they were still working out the kinks. We declined her offer to bring us more desserts. I had suffered enough battle fatigue for one meal. Until those \"kinks\" get worked out, I recommend going elsewhere. The two star rating weighs the good food against the challenge to enjoy it.",

We started off with the charred octopus, tuna poke, and the baked ricotta. All of which were delicious!

    "text": "Very weird....Two of us arrived at 5:50pm to join 3 other members of our party for a reservation at 6pm. After waiting a few minutes, we decided to ask the very friendly hostess if the others had yet arrived. She said no, but confirmed our reservation for 5 persons at 6pm. So far, so good. We continued to wait in front of the hostess podium. By the time the other 3 persons arrived at 6:10pm, we were ready to enter together. Then, the hostess explained that the table was not yet ready. Not yet ready?? A table for 5 when the restaurant on a Wednesday night is not particularly busy?? Why was it not ready after we announced our early arrival? Obviously, we were waiting for the other 3 people. Did she not notice this? Clueless! After  another 10, yes TEN, more minutes, she announced that our table needed to be put together or brought from another room or from the basement or some other lame excuse. We waited another 5 or so minutes until the table was finally ready. Wow! No one else entered the restaurant while we were waiting....so what was the holdup? When we finally sat down, we noticed there were many employees. Some were busy, but others were not. The meal took a long time to prepare apparently and all five dishes did not arrive together. Food was at best mediocre. I ordered the salmon that rested on some strange-looking goop that they called eggplant puree. Although not offensive, it didn't taste like eggplant but it looked like spackle with lumps in them. The lumps were garbanzo beans. The portion was not worth the price. Also, they served it in what looked like my dog's water dish. Resting your fork and knife between bites while carrying on a conversation was a challenge. After we ate, no one offered a dessert. Oh well, maybe that would have taken another half hour to prepare. Expensive? yes! Worth it? No!",

My wife had the roasted chicken which she said was just ok, but the big issue was that there was hair in her side salad.  I had the lobster cocktail which was good, but quite small for the price. My filet was excellent and cooked perfectly for my taste. As we were finishing our meal another server came up for the first time with bread and butter!! I think he was about 40 minutes too late. Don't know if we will return as there are many other restaurants in the area that we have had better overall experiences...plus I do not think that my wife will get over the hair in her salad. My overall rating would be a 4.5 for food and server, but drops to 3 as nobody enjoys a strand of hair in their foods",

We were sat right away but not given any menus had to ask for them which is odd as a former server that makes no sense to me. Our server was friendly and up-sold the bottomless mimosa we ordered that and a strawberry cobbler to start. The cobbler took forever and when it arrived it was like luke warm strawberry soup. Would have said something but our server didn't check on us when it arrived.  he returned we ordered the cinnamon bun French toast, and the chicken and waffles.  Flash forward 45 minutes our food finally arrives, my husbands chicken is dry and cold and my cinnamon bun is cold and raw in the middle yet the plates are blazing hot, now the reason for that is the food was made and sitting in the window under a heat lamp causing the plate to heat up. Also the chicken is what is called \"sand-bagged\" meaning made earlier then refried when ordered which any chef will tell you dries the hell out of it. So we complain, the server re-fires the food. Another 20 minutes and out comes the food, COLD AND DRY AGAIN! at this point I had enough I go to the manager who tells me he will speak to the chef and take our food off the check. So for two hours we got to drink mimosas, what a waste. BTW the mimosas were advertised as bottomless yet we got charged for two bottles and the second one we didn't ask for. Paid 32.00 for two bottles of mimosas. And for the first time in my life we got to spend two hours in a restaurant and leave hungry. I also want to point out that we saw this place on the food network and shame on you food network for making me think this restaurant  was better then it actually is.  Will never go back.",

People seated after us, about 4tables, ordering way more apps and entrees and refreshments finished and left before our entrees even arrived.  4 times having to be reassured that our food will come out.  The food was pretty good but not too grand to overlook the incompetence and lack of attention to our table.  The chef sent us complimentary deviled eggs.  Delicious but Idk if I can say it was good enough.  I understand there are complications in the kitchens and mistakes can be made, but they're professionals...

I had the California Benny, and was expecting chicken that was cooked in the restaurant and then shreaded, or the breast sliced, but what I received was what looked and tasted like the pre-cooked Foster Farm chicken strips you buy at the store to use on salads.  They used cut and folded portions from their menu under their burgers, which was perplexing; as it wasn't big enough to wrap around the burger to catch drippings and was a soggy mess by the time the rest of my party finished their burgers.  Certainly will not make my \"Brunch\" list, but I may try again for cocktails and to watch a game with friends...provided I'm not too thirsty.",

I threw in a couple pictures of just some of my favorites. The fried chicken topped off with farmers market honey (waiter said that it was voted best in NV or something), the crab cakes which were filled with a ton of crab chunks, the wings which are covered in a flavorful buffalo sauce and my personal favorite, the Hanger Steak. This is the first restaurant I've ever tried a hanger steak at and I can't get enough. It's a large portion steak but the size takes nothing away from the flavor. Medium marbleization with some serious taste. Service is always on point and one of the coolest things about this place is that they have new chef specials everytime I come in. One of my favorites I've had so far was the citrus pork pizza. It was like having an al pastor taco but instead of a taco, it was a pizza!! This place is always coming up with some cool new dishes that I've gotta try. The food here is at a great price range and the portions are more than generous. Can't wait to go back.",

About 40 minutes later we decided to go check and see what was the delay.... To our surprise they didn't have our name or number down at all! When they realize that they had made an error of course they took the steps to correct it and got us seated immediately. The salad was very tasty, a little overpriced.  The waitress was not up to par for this restaurant or any other, I should've remembered her name as  wasn't very friendly just kind of aloof. I guess the reason I didn't bother remembering her name is  We do not plan on returning to this restaurant.",

I know you all want the details and not my prose so see below :  * Waiter forgot one of the items ordered * Waiter went on break while we were eating and was nowhere to be found to offer further service * Price point for the food was way too high for the portion size. $16 for a piece of toast with Crab is far too high for what it is.  * Waiter did not know the menu selections in order to speak to their ingredients",

Dinners ordered were fried chicken, pot pie, scallop risotto, filet mignon, shrimp with pasta and salmon. We shared two side orders ,One of mac and cheese and Brussel sprouts. Only complaint was my filet was a bit undercooked from my requested medium well. I still enjoyed it and had to share with my husband because the portion was large.  A couple desserts were ordered, ice cream, sorbet and the peanut butter lava cake. Large portions and they also put a cookie in the ice cream bowl.  We requested a table change before we ordered as a few of us found the high top table and the chairs uncomfortable, the request was handled very promptly. Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.  Friday night music began at 8pm and the solo singer/guitar player was good. I took off one star because there were too many TV's all with sports.   After dinner we moved over to the lounge area with leather sofas and had a few rounds of the table shuffleboard game. An enjoyable evening and we would return. In better weather the patio is also open.",

    "text": "Last night we decided on Hearthstone for my fiancee's Pre-Birthday dinner and wasn't disappointed. We were joined by our best friends to enjoy this place. I apologize ahead of time for not remembering our server's name but she's a pretty girl that looks like Lea Michele. She is a wonderful server and had spot on recommendations for us, being that it was our first time there. Before I get to the food, let me start with the vibe. This place has great energy, the customers were talking, eating, smiling....definitely a good setting. The live music was great, the guy can sing and was spot on his game. So now to the food, on our waitress's recommendation, we ordered the meat and cheese sampler and  our go to appetizer of spinach & artichoke dip. For our main's, I ordered the impossible burger with fries, my fiancee ordered truffle ricotta w/ chicken and our friend's ordered the prime rib French dip and French onion soup and his wife ordered Calabrian shrimp pasta. Everything was soo good, there were no complaints. Almost forgot, we ordered the house Pinot Grigio and 2 Schofferhofer Hefeweizen. The Pinot was good and the Schofferhofer was possibly the best Hef I have tasted. At the end of our dinner,we wrapped it up with pineapple upside down cake, peanut butter lava cake and the glazed donut bread pudding. All in all, I was very impressed with the food and ambiance of Hearthstone and most importantly the service. We couldn't have asked for a better server! Thank you for a great night",

    "text": "First of all, this place was absolutely huge. It goes all the way from the entrance of the casino to the back where they have outdoor seating with fire pits and tea lights. There are also quite a few televisions if you like an upscale sports bar type of atmosphere. They have quite a bit of seating styles everything from hightops to couches and cubbies.  There are a few games set up for those who wish to have the True bar experience.  They occasionally have live music. The musician who is there was extraordinarily good and played all his own instruments and did some very decent covers.  This establishment has a happy hour. But the window is very narrow so make sure you check the website as I have seen a change twice.  The prices for food and drinks there are reasonable. They did have one drink in particular that had habanero sauce in it... It was classified as a Margarita... It should have been classified as volcanic lava LOL :-) but it was one of the more popular drinks and I saw the bartenders bring out dozens within the few hours I was there.  the staff and bartenders and servers were all very competent and provide service with a smile. This place seemed to even flow as far as busyness one minute he would be extraordinarily packed and then there would be a sparse amount of people.  I will definitely be back!",

The shrimp pasta I loved so much (see previous review) was replaced by a new version with a heavier sauce and much smaller shrimp. A big departure from the old dish. Nothing special about it and I probably wouldn't order it again. The lobster cocktail was tiny and overpriced.   On the flip side, the grilled octopus was very good. My husband had the lobster roll, which he really enjoyed. Service was also pretty good.  I'm not one to choose quantity over quality, but the value should definitely be there. If you're paying $100 for dinner for two (no alcohol), you should be left feeling satisfied. This wasn't the case for me, unfortunately.",

The deviled eggs were wonderful and had a slight taste of horseradish which really worked well.   The only dish that failed, and failed terribly, was the hummus.   They seem to grade a jalapeno into it which gives it a little spice, but that's it.  The rest tastes like graded sand.   I think 5 starts would have been given but gave 4 because of hummus and also atmosphere with tons of televisions makes it feel more like a bar than the great restaurant it is.",

Everything was great: food, service, atmosphere.  I received a free glass of Pinot Noir for checking in on Yelp!; their house options were delicious.  We were seated right away and our waitress was attentive and knew her audience (knew how to work the wallet, haha).  We ordered appetizers and had some wine before ordering our main entrees.  We shared the braised shortrib meatballs (in a tomato sauce), bacon wrapped dates (they were HUGE and so good), and the tuna tartare (heavily loaded with truffle oil- not my thing).    After enjoying our appetizers, we ordered the fried chicken, pot pie (more truffle oil), calabrian shrimp pasta, cheeseburger, octopus, and mac and cheese (made with brie and fontina). The pot pie and cheeseburger were okay, but the pasta and octopus were delicious.  The fried chicken and mac and cheese were the solid runaway dishes, though.  The chicken was JUICY and flavorful while the mac and cheese was rich and decadent.  I would order those two items again, no questions asked.  Somehow we were coaxed into ordering dessert (we ate every bite of every entree and practically felt sick when we left) and shared the peanut butter lava cake and chocolate souffle.  The lava cake was also rich and the chocolate souffle was the least exciting thing we ate all night.  After finishing our feast, we took advantage of the shuffleboard games in the corner and had a great time.  We're going back for happy hour on Thursday and we cannot wait!",

It's conveniently located just within the Red Rock Casino, which still offers free parking. (Yay!)   I came here for brunch and ordered the Salted Caramel French Toast which was a gigantic cinnamon sticky bun with a warm banana maple syrup on the side. As I sat up at the bar, this dish was a literal head turner. The perfect amount of drizzle, not overly sweet and topped with some of the freshest strawberries, raspberries and blueberries I've ever had...I was basically licking the plate!   I also ordered a cup of coffee, which came as a mini pour-your-own pot with a tiny vial of cream; that's what I love about this place, it's all about the details.   At about 1:30pm on a Saturday I was able to walk right in with my choice of indoor, patio or bar seating! The best part about the layout is the variety. There are high tops, lush couches in the center, (perfect for mingling,) bar seating if you'd like to catch a game or elevated crescent booths for larger parties or snuggling up close to your date. But don't worry, if you chose to sit outside, they've got misting fans to keep you cool!   They also offer bottomless mimosas, live music and wine samplings on select evenings. But, their mind-blowing brunch is only available on the weekends and select holidays!",

My daughter got a salad w/ grilled chicken on top & it was not cooked all the way, still pink in the middle. They were tiny pieces of chicken so it should have been no prob cooking them all the way. Also, this place is not cheap, $7-$9 beers, like regular 12 oz. bottles. Outrageous. Ya, Red Rock is super nice so u expect a lil bit higher prices. But I also expect the food to be cooked properly so no one gets food poisoning & has to go home & puke up raw chicken. We won't go back to this one.

    "text": "When my friend and I arrived it was about 6:30 PM PST on a Thursday and at first glance, it was really busy. Luckily though, we were seated at the pizza bar towards the back aka away from the noise which was perfect.   We both started out with drinks and appetizers for happy hour. I ordered a Moscow Mule (not part of HH, but I can't resist) and Carly ordered a Bay Breeze. Food wise, she ordered the chicken wings and I chose calamari. The calamari was good, except for the slices of lemon that were fried as well that I accidentally ate....but still good nonetheless LOL   Dinner wise, she ordered the Bussell Sprout Salad w/ Chicken. I passed on trying her dish because of the  Caesar dressing (most Caesar dressings are made with raw eggs) but she said it was amazing. I ordered a Meatball Pizza, coincidentally on National Pizza Day. For $23.00 I thought it was ok. Definitely had great flavors and the ricotta on top was phenomenal, but I've this style pizza elsewhere, for less money, comparing taste, as well as larger.   We finished our bff catch up session with dessert. Carly ordered the Peanut Butter Lava Cake which apparently was delicious (in another life, I may know such pleasures). I ordered vanilla ice cream, which came with three large scoops and a warm cookie. Def wasn't expecting it to be that big of a dessert.",

The selections on happy hour for drinks was limited- so if you are looking for cocktails they only have ONE drink on there. That was not appeasing. And the waitress we was rude about it when she explained it to us, sorry first time here and we go to a lot of bars who have more than one cocktail on a happy hour menu!   Would I come here again? Would I recommend this restaurant- sure one bad experience with service should bring people back.",

The space is open and beautiful, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the food is excellent.  While I'd go any day of the week and enjoy the standard menu they have some excellent happy hours items as well (I love the baked ricotta with truffle honey) and dollar oysters on Wednesdays.  Their cocktail selection is also quite good. My wife always enjoys the blackberry bliss.  Compared to strip prices the cost is very reasonable as well!",

    "text": "I'm going to write this review while I'm a bit buzzed still, because if I don't, it'd be a 2-star summation. Points for high ceilings and decor. That's it. It's a good night to be generous, so here we are, in uncharacteristic brevity:  I had my free buffet ticket, which included $10 anywhere else in the casino. I went here on (observed) Veterans' Day because the line elsewhere was too much, and it was time to try something new in RedRock. What a letdown.   I had the Calabrian Shrimp Pasta, which sounds exquisite, but is not. It has heat, as indicated by the chili descriptor, but is otherwise devoid of flavor. The entire dish is uniform, no variety in flavor. Noodles too long (twss) and missed the al dente part. This is all I had.   The capstone was billing out. I was told my state-issued ID with veteran status indicated was insufficient. It's a Veterans' Day promo, so imagine the frustration and, sitting next to others, the show. Somehow my casino-issued card cleared the way, though. Thank you for your service? None of that. A manager had to be called into play.  \"Oh okay, yes, she will take care of that.\" Brilliant.  A small but telling fiasco.   Plan: enjoy a free buffet of quality food. Result: mediocre-at-best food at Hearthstone, the runaround, and a $25 tab. $35 on a regular night for blase pasta and shrimp, and one beer? God bless America.    You'll find better food at the Feast buffet a short casino-floor walk away, and far superior service. Would have done better using that coupon at Aunti Anne's pretzels.",

We came with a large group (12 people) for a birthday. We came because they had half price bottles of wine, which was awesome. The happy hour menu offers tasty bites that were decently priced (everything $6) and during a football game you can upgrade the wings to all you can eat ($10). They even had happy hour wine that was also $6 (per glass).   The service however, was so so slow. The restaurant was pretty empty, but it still took forever for everything. I ordered a drink and the waitress came back 20min later asking if I wanted a drink. I told her yes and she came back with a taster glass. What the heck? I told her I wanted the adult size and she finally came back with my drink. That was forgivable, but the worst was the wings. Even for bottomless, they only bring you 4 wings at a time and it took 10 - 15min for each round to come out. It got so bad the manager comped us 3 desserts to make up for it; kudos for that. My friends said something similar happened to them the last time they were there and that they also ended up getting comped food. (I'm sensing a trend).  The wine was tasty, the food was good, but don't come if you are in a rush.",

There was always bountiful food and drinks all around the table.  I must have tried a dozen different things, so I'll just comment on a few of my favorites. The best plate of the night for me was the octopus. I've always been lukewarm toward octopus, which I thought of as overpriced, but this one was so tender that I finally understand the hype.   The tuna tartare was also quite good, although the combination of the large pieces and the super delicate chips made it rather difficult to eat. From what I gather, the Baked Ricotta is the restaurant's signature dish, and I totally get why. Everyone at the table was raving about it and its lifespan couldn't have been but two minutes.  This was truly the perfect venue for the occasion!",

They were not stingy with the amount they gave us. This appetizer is free when you do a yelp checkin! Also, we had the baked truffle ricotta which was SOO GOOD. I highly recommend, it is on the sweet side, so if you are okay with that, definitely get it.   I ate dinner with my 2 sisters. I got the special they were having which was a halibut wit a mushroom risotto. Honestly, I feel in love with this dish. This dish wasn't heavy, but made me so full when I finished. My fish was cooked perfectly. The rice in my risotto was crunchier than I would like it, but the flavor was heavenly. I ate my whole plate clean.   My sister got the salmon. It was really really good. I highly recommend this dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly. But in my opinion, the real stars of this dish is the MUSHROOMS. The mushrooms were stuffed with a salmon puree, and it was heavenly.  We ran into a situation that they brought her halibut instead of salmon, but it was no big deal. The waiter own up to his mistake and quickly got it resolved. (They did apologize a lot for this mistake which we didn't see it being that big of a deal, but we really appreciate how much they cared)   My other sister got the rotisserie chicken. I thought this was okay because the chicken was on the dry side.   Lastly, we had a dessert (given for free due to the mistake on their side, which was really nice of them). We had the Nutella and chocolate pot de creme. This was amazing. And it came with 2 cookies! This was the perfect dessert especially if you love chocolate, but you want to end with a light dessert.   Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant! But would recommend not getting the rotisserie chicken. Everything else though, was amazing and delish!",

    "text": "On my first visit my girlfriend invited me here for Wednesday night $1 oysters.  I am not a big fan of oysters but I am a big fan of Happy Hours so I accepted the invite.  Having never been here before I was immediately impressed with the decor.  To me it was very Chip and Joanna farmhouse inspired.  We were seated at a booth facing the bar.  We had two servers, a male and female.  I wish I could remember the male's name but he was training Jillian, the female.  They were both very attentive and offered suggestions.  We were going to order a carafe of wine and Jillian let us know that for the price and amount we were better off ordering by the glass.  Aside from the oysters our table ordered the chicken wings, pepperoni pizza and the herbs and green salad.  The Happy Hour menu offerings are $6 so obviously these aren't large portions and it was what you would expect wings, pizza and salad to be.  At least twice during our meal a manager came by to check on us.   Second visit I came with a group of girlfriends, four of us total.  We had reservations, were seated and given menus, both Happy Hour and regular.  Two of us had preordered the Lobster Bowl special for $24.  We asked the waitress about it and she didn't know what we were talking about as far as reserving it.  Not a big deal because she checked and said there were plenty available, 30 to be exact,  After taking our drink orders she kind of disappeared but not really because we could see her chatting with another waitress while we were sitting there with our menus closed ready to order.  Once she finally noticed we were ready she came back and we ordered our food items.  Service on this occasion was not that great.  It was more of a flag down who you could type of evening.  If not for us flagging who we could down I don't remember her independently checking on us once.   The Lobster Bowl was a disappointment.  The lobster was okay but the accompanying bowl items, the potatoes and sausage were bland, tasteless and not seasoned at all.    At this point just by default I'm sure I will be back at the invite of a friend but I will stick to happy hour going forward and hold my expectations of service to a minimum.",

We ordered dessert and sat waiting for more than 20 minutes for it. It was a piece of pie!!  I wanted to cancel it but as I left to use the restroom, he finally brought it. And immediately went back to visit at the friend's table.  I don't know how the manager accepts this. And the person giving us water told us we were lucky to have him as a server because he was awesome. If I could find her I would set her straight.",

Each item was $7, guess the price went up a dollar. Portions were small but you get what you pay for. Had the baked ricotta toast, veggie slider w sweet potato fries, wings, and checked in for the hummus. I am not a vegetarian but the veggie slider was the best I've ever had. I would order that over a greasy cheesy hamburger. That's how good this was. Wings were unmemorable and hummus was meh but can't complain about free food right? Very impressed w the freshness of the oyster.   I'd come back for the oysters and the veggie sliders. Service was surprisingly good and got seated quickly.",

I'll just say that Anthony Bourdain was right to warn not to order seafood on Wednesday--fresh shipments typically come on Thursday.  I had the vegan sliders and they were delicious. My hubby's rotisserie chicken was good, though not great, and slightly over-spiced. The hummus plate we started with was a win, though; it was a generous portion (not the happy hour size) and served with really yummy crackers.  The biggest plus AND minus was the service. They seemed to be overwhelmed when we arrived and no one came to take our drink order in the bar area for at least 15 minutes. The staff made up for that, however, by acknowledging their mistakes and giving incredibly friendly table service.  All in all, we would return!",

Our waiter took 10 minutes to approach us, another waitress addressed us before he did, to ask us if we wanted menus. After dropping off our food he never once came back to check in, see if we wanted anything else or drinks etc. He finally came to check if we wanted boxes and dropped off the check. In between all of this we had to watch the hostess and another waiter play out what appeared to be their personal drama on the patio. Good grief.",

My husband is rather picky with foods he eats (me, not so much as I love everything and anything), and after one single bite of his food he immediately told me that it was some of the best chicken he has had. My sandwich, however, was THE tastiest sandwich I've had in a long time. If they had that as a regular menu item I would order it every time. Overall, our waitress was kind and service was great.

One of my Uncle's is a veteran and he had his military ID with him.   I split the meatball pizza with my other Uncle. The meatball pizza was with veal and pork meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella. My Aunt ordered a chopped salad to start and shared it with everyone. I had some and it was pretty good. It reminded me of pepperocinics. Probably because there were pickled red peppers and pickled garbanzo beans in it that had that spicy pickled flavor. My parents got the grilled octopus to start and it was alright. it wasn't as crispy as I would like though, kinda slimy on the outside.   All the entrees came out two at a time. We got our pizza last. It was a really delicious pizza. The meatball was meaty, yet smooth and the ricotta globs were creamy. The ricotta was my favorite part. I would even dip my crust from my last slice of pizza into the ricotta from my next slice since it was a little burnt and hard. My Uncle and I destroyed it, we ate the whole thing. Except for one slice though, we gave that to my Dad. They really do have excellent pizza here.   For dessert I got the s'mores milkshake with Kaluhua. It was really good. You could taste the alcohol, but it wasn't too strong and the s'mores was tasty. Service here was great. Our waitress was really nice and informative. This place deserves an extra star. We all had a great dinner.",

The restaurant was half empty, but we were seated on the patio because all the tables inside were reserved.  It was actually a nice day out, with a little breeze.  The misters were on so that made it kind of cold.  They eventually turned them off, but not before basically being showered on. Lol no biggie, but it was a little chilly.  I ordered the Baked Ricotta Toast with truffle, honey, and chives.  This came off the Happy Hour (5-7 pm) menu.  I thought it was absolutely delicious.  My mom thought it was too sweet.    For my entree I had the Truffle Pasta with peas, prosciutto, truffle cream, and chicken.  It was yummy as well.  I also had a Raging Bull (vodka, passion fruit, orange, cranberry, lemon, Orange Red Bull) which was pretty tasty too.  We didn't have room for dessert.  Maybe next time.  At 7 pm there was live music.  The ambiance was lovely.  The restaurant is large and open, absolutely beautiful.  There are some couches near the live entertainment, but those filled up quickly.  The entire restaurant was almost full when we were finished.  Two cocktails, two happy Happy Hour appetizers, and two entrees came out to $96.  Service was friendly, but kind of slow.  We received our cocktails a few minutes after our appetizers.    I will be back to try more Happy Hour items.",

Im glad I have photos and videos of the event because I was so full and drunk to even remember the rest of the details.",

We came for our last night as a bachelorette partly in Vegas, and from the moment we sat down, the entire kitchen staff was attentive and helpful! The kitchen even sent out a complimentary margarita pizza for us which was spectacular!   The bride-to-be had the blossom bomb cocktail and it was one of the most balanced drinks we had in the city and the most beautiful to look at. I asked for a gin drink modified with basil and lemon (which I ask for often, and am always disappointed), but they NAILED it. I'm actually frustrated that we didn't come here sooner in our visit. Make it happen! Visit Hearthstone!",

Another 10 minutes after this the manager came to get drinks from us and told us our waitress would be with us shortly. She came and took our orders shortly after and that was the last time we saw her until she dropped our check off; which she did without saying anything, and before we were finished eating. We paid quickly even though we weren't finished, and then went 55 minutes without anyone coming over at all. After waiting for almost an hour for someone to stop by so we could get more water and mimosas, I asked a different busser if he would be able to grab refills for us. He said yes but after another 15 minutes of waiting and no one coming back we decided to get up and leave. Horrible experience, which is very disappointing considering this place had a very cool atmosphere and good food.",

At least if your going to be raked over the fire at the cash register, you   should stuff me up till I can't feel myself laugh, before you do that.

    "text": "Went here on a Sunday during brunch.  Let me start by saying the room is very nicely designed and the layout is inviting.  Service was uneven and our waitress simply took our order and seemed disinterested in providing quality customer service.    After reviewing the menu i noticed one thing.....PRICEY.  They have a $21 burger.  All it advertised on the menu was pickle sauce, pimento cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomato. Why the $21 price tag? Wagyu? Truffles?  Prime house made ground beef? I skipped it and went for the Croque Madame.  I ordered a Latte and got a Macchiato (call me a coffee snob but theres an obvious difference) and the wife ordered a coffee which never came.  Food a long time to come out but my dish was delicious.  The baby had pancakes (unfortunately no kids menu was provided). My wife had the Egg sandwich croissant that comes with breakfast potatoes.  It was strange that she requested to substitute the breakfast potatoes for the crispy hash browns on the sides menu (willing to pay an uncharge) she was quickly shut down and told no.  Potato for Potato...anyway she went with a side order of the has browns ($8) which when received (they forgot them when delivered the entrees) were no better than the hash browns you receive at Jack in the box.  They had to be frozen and not house made..disappointing.  Asked for a coke from the busboys..\"let me tell your server\"..its a coke just go get it.  Never charged on the check.   Wife asked for coffee again and was delivered...Never charged on the check.  This place has a lot of potential but service has the too cool for school attitude.  Hope they improve this area of the concept.",

Wind was blowing the cabana flap behind us, she subtly placed a pillow, kids wanted to play shuffle board and she volunteered to teach them the rules.

    "text": "They are getting one star because I love the decor and they could of had potential...  I really really really wanted to like this place, but I just can't justify anything beyond the decor and sitting near carrot top that was worth coming back for.   We arrived for our reservation and were seated promptly. It took over ten min to be greeted and given menus. Okay no big deal. I couldn't tell who our server was because there were about ten people working our table. Ordered a champagne... It tasted old... The cocktails were okay... Tried a few of my friends... The carrot tequila one (the baby maker) was pretty delicious.   We ordered a bunch of food to share... We asked them to make the broccoli vegan... Literally brought out steamed broccoli... No seasoning, garlic... Nothing... Okay. So I asked for a side of balsamic, never came. I asked again, and ten min later it showed up, but by then the broccoli was almost gone. We ordered the jalapeno hummus. I asked for a side of vegetables, told them I would pay. The server wasn't sure if the crispy sesame flat bread was Vegan... So I wanted to play it safer rather than be sorry. He went on to tell me he didn't think the chef would do a side of veggies... SO I had to order fourteen dollar veggies in this ice thing... It came with a green goddess dressing that I couldn't eat because the mayo had egg. Cool. Fourteen dollars for some raw veggies sticking up out of ice so I can eat the hummus. Nice up sell dude. Too bad it sucked and I got suckered. Steps of service guys!! Accommodate your guests without robbing them! The beet salad was really really good. Nice presentation and the only thing I didn't have to modify to death and get up charged on to eat.   Our friends ordered the octopus, said it was okay... And the roasted potatoes... Which were good... And the squash (wasn't vegan) couldn't try it but they said it was okay. They actually forgot to put the squash in and brought out two orders of potatoes on accident. Very accommodating and took both off the bill (props for fixing that one) They ordered the chefs choice meat and cheese board (don't waste your time or your money) it wasn't worth 10 dollars let alone the 20 they spent on it. Four crackers, a few slivers of meat, and a piece of cheese. (Go to honey salt and order it there) Our waters were dry for over twenty min... My friend needed a beer for almost 30 min... By the time they asked, we were ready to go. I promise you I am not even over exaggerating on the time frames right now, it really pissed me off. It was my birthday... Not even a happy birthday from any of the ten people we had working our table.  I love good food, going out, and spending money is never an issue. I was genuinely excited about trying this place. I can honestly say none of us will ever be back. The food I could eat was bland and not flavorful... For the price point... It should of been on point and it just wasn't. I still had a great bday though. And I'm glad to say I could knock this one off our book marks.",

    "text": "Went here last night for dinner at around 6pm. The design and decor of the place is very inviting with a fun atmosphere. Ordered the artichoke shared plate which was not what we expected. It was 4 hearts with a cilantro sauce. It was tasty don't get me wrong just a little small. Next we ordered to full sized entrees, the Calabrian shrimp pasta and the braised short ribs. Both were awesome tasting but again were small for the price. The only other thing that bothered me just a little was the fact that it felt like we have 5 different waiters serving us. It was pretty hard to figure out who we were tipping at the end of the meal. Overall food was well put together with good complex flavors but service could have been just a bit better with more engaged waitstaff and yes it's inside red rock so expect to pay a premium. These 3 dishes and two drinks a little over 100.00 with tip.",

    "text": "Went in for brunch at noon with my daughter (1year old) and my niece (10 years old). I had 3 friends joining us later for brunch and mimosas. The restaurant was fairly busy. They had two large parties plus a dining room full of people. So I was patient. I'm a server so I understand when things get hectic. We asked to move to the lounge area since the short tables were taken and it isn't possible to put a high chair at the booths. My daughter is one year old so it also gave her more room to run around. We were seated at 12:10pm. Moved at 12:18pm. The server greeted herself and asked if we were dining in or just waiting to be seated. I told her we were dining and wanted drinks around 12:20 we ordered our drinks. Then she didn't come back she was serving all of the other tables around us but not us. At 12:47 I have two hungry and upset children with me; who hadn't eaten all morning. All of the tables around us had eaten some were able to eat and leave before our server even offered us food. So I called over the manager or supervisor danielle. Danielle apologized and turned the experience around. Our food arrived shortly after 1 pm and my kids were finally happy. The food was delicious. If it wasn't for Danielle I wouldn't come back because of bad service. There is no reason you should neglect a particular table for 20-30 minutes. I'm used to it because of the color of my skin. Typically people don't serve me or put their all into me because I'm young and black they think I won't tip or something. But I'm a server myself. And pride myself on customer service and speed of service. So I would hope to be treated that way when I go out to places. I won't post the servers name because towards the end when all of my friends arrived she became faster. Also some of her tables left so I believe she had more time to serve us. This restaurant got 4 stars because of the management. Good management can make or break an establishment.",

We had the worst service. We felt invisible and ignored. The poor bar back wasn't allowed to help us b/c they're union and his job wasn't to tend to guests. It was my man's first visit and he said he never needs to go back. There is something about a concept when Light Group owns them that they don't hire experience, they go for looks. Womp womp",

First off the decor and ambiance is great, really lovely atmosphere with nice big tables that feel like you are eating in a reclaimed barn/small town mill of sorts.  Rustic furniture and distressed white washed brick walls made it feel very comfortable and inviting.  The staff was very friendly and very attentive to our large group.  We came to celebrate a birthday and get some food before a move that night.  We never felt rushed and we encouraged to have a great time.  The food was delicious and we sampled from a few of the starters.  Nothing we had was bad so I won't point out something specific to try, just try it all!  I was really craving pork when I got there but the server made a great suggestion with the hanger steak; really delicious.  I would say that I'd give it 5 stars but for them to do that they need to have a pork option other than the beast feast for an entree.  Say a nice thick cut bone in pork chop with a nice reduction sauce....:)  just saying, I really wanted some pork last night! :)  Otherwise a great place I hope to come back to.",

I really enjoyed the some of the small plates for sharing. For instance, the Baked Ricotta & Honey was to-die-for, and the Charcuterie had some nice proscuitto & salami. But these plates literally came with like 4 pieces of bread....and weren't really large enough for sharing.   Overall, I just feel like the bang for your buck is not there. It's a cute space and the food is decent, but if I'm paying $11 for a Caesar salad, I expect it to be a full size salad. My salad was maybe the size of a side order, if that. I definitely still left hungry after spending $35....  PS - Came here for the \"Share the Love\" event, which I think is pretty awesome. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of house wine with dinner, and if you order a charcuterie plate, $5 goes to charity :) Event ends 2/7 so head on over soon if you wanna check it out!",

I laugh at negative reviews from any new restaurants grand opening.  You have to give it time for them to work out their kinks.    I would return nightly just for their steak tartare.  It is awesome!  In fact, most of their appetizers are really good.  Tuna carpaccio, oysters, seafood platters...    For kids, they let them make their own pizza.  Kudos to any restaurant in a casino that acts like they care about the families with kids.  The ambience is great.  Service is solid.  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Summerlin.",

We got there in time for the happy hour which the friendly hostess Ashley informed me was only at the bar and lounge, so we sat at the bar. The restaurant had interesting antiquish decorations and a trendy atmosphere. There is a $6 hh menu, with some drinks on it too. My boyfriend had the steak tar tar bites and I had to try the pepperoni pizza and I'm glad I did! The pizza is so good really smoky with fresh tasting ingredients. For dinner I had the Salmon- delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed the Hanger steak, it was seriously the best. The bartender Fernando also talked us into a lava cake for dessert, It was all incredibly flavorful. I loved the food here, and their happy hour is a pretty good deal. I will definitely be back to try some more woodfired pizzas!",

We came around 6 and even though we did not have a reservation and it was quite busy the hostess was kind and showed us to a table. Our server, Caitlyn arrived almost immediately after and help guide us through the menu and help narrow down some of our choices. She recommended the baked ricotta appetizer which was FANTASTIC, seriously, this was like dipping toast into a pot of gold. My husband got the Hangar Steak which he enjoyed, and I tried the salmon, which was another one of our server's recommendations. I've had a lot of salmon at a lot of different places but this may be the best piece of salmon that I have ever had, it was cooked to perfection and came with an eggplant puree which was the perfect accompaniment to the dish. At the end when the dessert menu was dropped off we were both so full but with the previous courses being so good we decided to suck it up (we're troopers, I know), and try the peanut butter lava cake. And I have no words to describe it, it was fantastic. One of the managers, Sarah even came by the table to make sure that everything was okay which I really appreciated because most restaurants don't do this anymore and it all together was a very enjoyable experience in a very beautiful restaurant. We will be coming back!",

I had about seven plates because I love to eat and enjoyed eating all of them even if there flavor did no appeal to me. The Brie was awesome almost too much flavor. The beef tartar was unreal good and as crazy as this sounds the bread to put it was on point! Stuffed dates were way different than most and made you think. The meatballs were also good and my wife liked them a lot even though the spices did not agree with mostly because there was some Clive in there which I can't stand. The foie peanut butter and jelly was great in concept and execution. Than the dessert we had the peanut butter lava cake. I loved this plate. It was interactive interesting and intensely flavored.

    "text": "I met some friends here for dinner.  I had parked outside so I entered through the patio.  Once I entered the door there wasn't any signs about where to check in but there was a desk to the right that looked like it could be a hostess stand.  No one was there but when I turned to the left someone was fixing pictures on the wall.  I asked her where to go to be seated and she told me just to wait here until someone comes to help me then she turned her back and continued to play with the pictures on the wall.  I wondered why she couldn't help me and it felt really cold.  So I eventually got seated with my party.  We were seated by the kitchen and there was a bad smell almost like burnt grease/oil.  I ordered the lobster roll for my entree.  I noticed right away it had a \"fishy\" not fresh smell.  I took one little bite which confirmed it wasn't fresh.  I didn't want to complain in front of my friends so I just didn't eat it.  After my friends finished the meal the waiter took away the food.  I don't know if they didn't notice or care that my entire meal was still on my plate but no one asked me if my meal was OK or if there was a problem.  I was still hungry so I asked for the desert menu... 3 times!  The third trip back I was served the bill (not the desert menu).  I left hungry and paid for a meal I didn't eat.  The service was horrible the food was horrible.  I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There's too many other options in town.",

I thought the outdoor dining area was really well planned out and had a great atmosphere. The staff was very caring and the manager even went around to check on people as well which I really enjoyed. The food was a very good. I had the prime rib and a side of mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts and it was all excellent. The pricing was very fair for what type of a restaurant that it was. I think red rock is very lucky to have them as a restaurant and by the way it was an excellent location inside the casino as well.",

It is a great experience from the moment you step foot into the establishment. I was greeted by a lovely gal at the front desk named Natalie with black hair she was able to take a last minute reservation for my family and I on a busy day, accommodated our table requirements and even allowed us to switch the times when we needed to. Outstanding help from the host! (Though I may have been difficult, she is greatly appreciated). Service is quick and thorough. I have dined here for both dinner and brunch. Great place to watch games! It can be a very casual attire or nice spot to get dressed up. During the summer time they have their patio open and it is so beautiful to sit out there. Saturday's they have live music which is very fun! They do take kids here, but I would add that there is a bar and lounge area so be sure to be mindful of that. The manager is so sweet and really cares about the experience of all the guests. Thanks Russell! Love the bottomless mimosas for brunch, the pizza is also SO BOMB HERE!! Thank you Natalie, Russell, and my server Rigo from brunch! Thank you to the bussers who were very attentive to water fills as well! Lovely restaurant!",

    "text": "Unfortunately my whole experience here was a total disaster.    This should be a one star review but the servers were so friendly I'm giving another star.   I went as part of a group dinner.  We waited 45 minutes before someone came and took our drink order.  We waited another 20 minutes for the drinks to come.    We ordered a bottle of wine.   The server brought a different bottle than we ordered but we caught it before the bottle was opened.    While ordering the bottle of wine we inquired about the wine special that was being scrolled nonstop across the tv screen in my hotel room.  The special was order one bottle and get a second bottle at half price.  The server stated the special was just changed to the following day.  The manager refused to honor the special in spite of it being advertised on the tv in our room.    Then we ordered appetizers for the table.  They took a long time to arrive.  We ordered a charcuterie sampler for the table. Everyone agreed the portions were very small.    After we finished eating the appetizers and waited even more, the server came back and took out dinner order.   I ordered a hanger steak.  It came out as I ordered it and it was seasoned well.   The servers were aware of the delays and apologized and stated they were under staffed.   Total 3.5 hours for the dinner due to the delays.     For me, there are many other options in the area.  I won't be coming back.",

Hearthstone is a farm to table feel american restaurant that offers some unique twists that make it a definite place to try.   All of their flatbreads are worth a shot, my favorite is the Abe Froman... not sure who that guy is, but the (not overpowering) fennel goes really well with the garlic sausage.    Ceviche was good but not great... but i am more of a traditionalist on this one... why ruin a good thing and add watermelon to a dish like this? But all the cool kids have new takes on ceviche these days so i get it i guess.   Meatballs: great. Tuna tartare: fantastic. But really if you want to do it right, get a group of friends together and go with the whole suckling pig. Had a chance to do this at a yelp event earlier this year and it was one of my best dining experiences of the last several months IMO. If you can get past the little eyes looking at you (which i quickly did), you will definitely enjoy this. They even come out to the table to cut it up and serve. Cool, but i hear tends to scare the other customers (get over it).   Also try their private cellar on Thursday. Cant beat free wine.",

Thank goodness we shared because the pancakes were huge and filling. The oysters came out first and it was ok. It was kinda fishy to me and I eat a lot of oysters. Pancakes were decent but the bacon and hash browns were good. The pancakes come in 3 big stacks and it's big so it's shareable. I did notice the water glass they leave out on the table were a bit dirty but I didn't say anything because I drank my Bloody Mary and my boyfriend ordered a coke which our server brought out in separate glass. Overall I think this place is okay. Some things are good and some can be improved.",

    "text": "All you can eat wing Mondays, What!!!! Count me in........ or so I thought. Came here on a Monday night for the football specials that included all you can eat chicken wings for 10$ and 10$ pitchers of limited domestic beers. I have yet to find a truly great wing place here in Vegas so I thought why not give Hearthstone's wing special a try. Upon ordering the wings the server looked annoyed and seemed to keep that demeanor the entire length of our dining experience. Once we received our first batch of wings they were soaked in buffalo sauce. The sauce itself was nice and tangy, however there was so much sauce that the wings were floating in a lake of it. I attempted to get our server's attention to ask if my next batch of wings could be made with light sauce but he never came and checked on us. Thankfully a food runner (I believe his name was James) came out of the blue from the kitchen and brought out our next batch of wings with a smile. He informed me that he could make the wings with sauce on the side and quickly brought some out to us. The sauce on the side was a winner and allowed the wings to maintain a crispy exterior. Overall, our experience as a whole was mediocre. The server was horrible and unattentive, however the food runner was amazing. He truly took care of us and deserved all of the credit. I had really high hopes for Hearthstone since they seem to cater towards locals with their specials. However, with the way their service is they may just be a last resort for tourists who are too lazy to leave their hotel.",

Sadly, I didn't love the food. I ordered the prime rib french dip and the meat tasted old to me. It had the taste of reheated meat which I really cannot stand. It came with a side of fries that were cold. I gave it three stars because I tasted someone's coconut cream and seasonal fruit parfait and that was really nice. The fruit was fresh. The yogurt and granola had great flavor and crunch. The waitress was MIA at the beginning but came around more towards the middle to end. I may go back just for that parfait.",

The first time I had the Mac and cheese and broccoli. The Mac and cheese was fantastic. The broccoli was a little burnt but overall it was good. My boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken and he said that it wasn't that great and he wouldn't order it again.   The second time we went we started with oysters from the west coast and they were super delicious(make sure you get the small ones). However I felt like they were overpriced because we got 6 and that cost $20. Would've loved to get more but that's too expensive.We then got the charcuterie, which I would say was average. My boyfriend got the chicken wings and said they were good. Once again, I got the Mac and cheese which was even more delicious that the 1st time. This time I requested no bread crumbs on the broccoli and it was amazing. Overall I think the sides are much better than the entrees so that's what I'll stick to the next time I go back.",

So 100% on the customer service. Now, the food.... pricey , amazing , cooked perfectly , will I come back???? % yaasssss..... I got the hanger steak, medium.... it was absolutely the best steak I've ever tasted, tender, cooked perfectly, amazing taste with the truffle aoili. My older sister got the prime rib medium rare... FIRE. It cut like butter and was soooooo tender. I don't like anything below medium, but not oh boy thay prime rib... Lord. Anyway, my son and nephew got the kids pizza. It is super awesome because they bring the pizza dough with eese and the toppings so the kids and decorate their pizza, be interactive with it, then they quickly bake and serve it. My little sister and sister in law got burgers. I can't remember what kind, but they both fell in love. And along with my amazing and perfect steak we got some show string fries... dip it in that aioli sauce.... chowwwww!!!!!!...... I will be back here if not monthly, every other month.",

No one at the host station...we literally went into the restaurant after waiting five minutes and found someone. The vibe was good. Music, chat, etc. Our server was nice but it took a long time to get an order in. Meatball pizza: ok at best: burnt crust, kind of bland. Seafood platter: this term is used reaaaally loosely. 2 shrimp, 4 small oysters, 1/2 a small lobster tail...really poor value. For the prices you could do better on the strip. Service was severely lacking. We were hoping for a new Sunday brunch place, but I doubt we'll be back.",

We absolutely love the warm chocolate cinnamon roll. This week we got two because I just can share that kind of deliciousness. There's no better way to enjoy your bottomless mimosas than on Hearthstone's couches, and when you need to get up and stretch (so you can eat MORE brunch) you can head to the shuffleboard tables for some healthy competition. Last weekend we had Kate as our waitress and the service could not be matched! We will for sure be asking for her next time we come back for brunch. Thanks for always keeping us smiling, Hearthstone!

I have never sat inside - why would you, on a sunny Vegas morning?! I've never had to make a reservation for brunch. The staff outside has always been very accommodating, even when a few of us have sat there for several hours.   The menu is a little expensive but it's very good. I rarely try a French Dip because the one on the menu at my parents' restaurant is so damn good, but Hearthstone's is honestly the first one that I have found that is legitimately good. I have also tried the salted caramel french toast that was delicious and gorgeous. I've never eaten at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, so don't know about that menu, but the breakfast menu is great!",

    "text": "I found at Hearthstone their intricate Linoleum flooring to be as genuine as their unconcerned inattentive service. Our waiter et al not only ignore our table of three (empty drink glasses and finished plates) but all of the other surrounding tables as well (server said his name was Josh). He passed our table exactly 5 times without addressing the work at hand. The food is equally lack luster: Lolly Pop Wings (tasted as well as plated) are similar to the product at Buffalo Wild Wing at 3 times the price. The Kale Caesar was tasty, and the super small (east coast?) Oysters (over priced 6 for $20) on the half shell were excellent tasting. However the tasteless Octopus Appetizer, was over boiled prior to charbroiling; as the skin rolled off of every mushy bland bite. I ordered the French Onion soup and 20 minute later was told the Chef need to \"refire\" it? Noteworthy: the bus boy's filthy Converse tennis shoes, and the manager's insincere tap on our table and with no eye contact blurted out, at the rapid pace of use car auctioneer, \"Thanks for joining us, Happy New Year\". The food could be a 3 but the service is bad at best. Fool me once Hearthstone.",

She told us the wait time would be 20 minutes, we patiently waited and said ok we will go to the bar in the meantime and make the wait worth! Well 20 minutes turned into almost 40 and the hostess did not even flinch to call us, we were waiting for a \"call\" that NEVER came through. Well my husband went to check and she said \" well you are going to have to wait 20 more minutes, I mean HELLOOOOOO, how could she? Then thank God for the waitress in the game room area, she took care of us, we were uncomfortable to say the least. We couldn't enjoy each other's company but at least we ate.  So it wasn't memorable but just as regular as any fast food restaurant. The food was good no doubt about it but your hostess threw our nice memorable family dinner out of the window which we paid a lot of money got so for that reason you get 2 stars.",

    "text": "We've been to Hearthstone several times and we really enjoy the restaurant. Tonight we tried three new (to us) dishes, and one old favorite. Surprisingly, only the old favorite was less than perfect. The new:  the Crab Cake appetizer was one large, very meaty crab cake with a nice crust, that came with a tasty slaw;  the rock shrimp lettuce cups had beautiful pieces of lettuce to wrap around very tasty shrimp; the fried chicken turned out to be four large pieces of juicy, mostly white meat chicken in an exceptionally addicting coating. All these were delicious. The disappointment was  the pasta shrimp, a dish I had had maybe four times previously, and each time it was the dish that I talked about for days after the meal and it was the dish that brought me back for more. I normally don't get spaghetti dishes, but I got this one because this dish used to have a light, distinctive sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Tonight the dish was different. Tonight the sauce was a heavy, creamy, spicy sauce. They warned me about the spice and the spice was not a problem. In fact the dish itself was not really a problem. It was good. The problem was that the dish was different than it had been the four previous times I ordered it. It was creamy and heavy, not light, and that's not what it used to be. So I was disappointed because I ordered expecting one thing based on my previous visits to the restaurant, but I got something that was entirely different.",

    "text": "We met some friends tonight at Hearthstone to celebrate a birthday. We were a party of 8; 4 couples. We sat outside to enjoy the gorgeous weather-the patio seating is definitely a huge plus. The server came over and took our drink order- which would turn out to be the only one of the night. (Big mistake- we are drinkers, which would have only resulted in a larger tip for her). Never again did she ask if we were ready for another round, not to mention it took 15 minutes just to get water. Then it was time to order food. A friend asked if they had a particular kind of cheese. She waved her hand over the menu and says, \"this is it.\" Okay.... Great... we ordered 2 types. We were never informed of any specials they were having, either. Everyone then ordered the main course. 7 dishes came out- and the 8th, about 7 minutes later. (All drink glasses still empty) She never stayed long enough to give us the chance, between conversation,  to order another. We finished our meals and ordered dessert. They all came out...without silverware. We were then informed that they had no clean spoons available and we would have to eat the ice cream and butterscotch pudding with a FORK. Seriously?! Yes, it was a Saturday night, but they were not busy. Several empty tables. The table next to us got up to get their own water at a nearby server station. Unacceptable. The food was good. The service was awful. Just awful. Walking out, we see the \"specials\" on the wall, and low and behold- the type of cheese my friend asked for at the beginning of the night- was one of them! At that point- our experience was comical. Don't think we will be back for a long time- if ever. Too many other amazing options Summerlin, with guaranteed stellar service. Hearthstone, your staff needs some extensive training. Good luck.",

    "text": "It's a shame the reviews are so lousy, but here's my take on it. It's not very organized. It's new enough that this doesn't bother me, and I own a restaurant so there are things I am relaxed about that prior to being in business I'd have been very upset about.   Here's the negative - things take way too long to get to the table (even the bill can take 20 minutes), but I hope a couple months and this will get worked out. Staff is friendly, but either over worked or disorganized. The music is wayyyyyy to loud. It's hard to talk without yelling. I know this seems to be the new thing and it makes a place seem busy even when it's not, but it drives me nuts (this is about only thing that will keep me from eating there every week or two). The other thing I don't like, which has nothing to do with my dining experience, is the form contact response with email address to a bad review. I empower all of my staff to comp, give out samples, whatever they need to to make customers happy. This makes them feel better about their job too, because they no they can make decisions at work without having to talk with a supervisor (just a suggestion). Also, it's smoother because when someone gets upset it gets fixed right then and there. If you don't like how they handled it, you discuss alternatives later, but let them make choice at the time.   Positive - And, why we'll go back. The food was excellent. I could not pick on the sauce for the short ribs being too salty, but otherwise we had a large group with a lot of things to try and everything was very good.",

FIRST off I came in with my family visiting from out of town expecting to be treated great with good service and amazing food from the reviews and people I know said it would be nice but I was highly mistaken. The hostess was nice very accommodating but the booth they placed us in was dirty with crumbs all in the tracks  of the seat. It also took 20mins to wait for server to come to even greet the table. The manager was a guy screaming at the chefs and servers very disrespectfully. Once my family noticed this we realized this was a poorly managed facility we decided to leave because of the bad energy. I was very disappointed I wanted to order a bottle wine for the occasion with my family. People who run restaurants should not only value the customers but the people who work for them as well! I will never ever return to a restaurant this unethical.",

    "text": "I was definitely disappointed with this restaurant... Our server was friendly and pleasant... The food was sub par... I've had better... Now the reason I have chosen to give this one star is because how our check was handled. Our bill was $75.00... We generously left $25.00 and made it an even $100.00... We had used our debit card to charge this... Come the next day our debit card was charged $75 AND another charge of $175... We called the restaurant and spoke a manager she said she would make the corrections... We also called our bank, we were told we had to handle it with the restaurant. The manager told us this would take three days to clear, there were no changes! After a few days not only did we not receive credit to our account there was another charge of $75!!! I could not believe this at all! This is our primary checking account, which was draining slowly as we were paying our bills..we contacted the GM of the restaurant he said he would have this fixed immediately did not happen we given the run around for two weeks. finally I had enough and contacted the Assistant food and beverage director of red rock... He had everything reversed and the $100 charged to our card within three business days... Quite honestly for putting up with this for nearly three weeks I believe everything should have been comped. This is so unprofessional and and was handled in the worst way.. We will never be going back to this restaurant... If you plan on visiting this place make sure you pay cash and even then double check what they give back to is the correct amount of change!",

    "text": "My family and I dined at Hearthstone last night which was our fifth time being there. The atmosphere is great and the food is excellent but nearly every time the service has been just okay or flat out terrible. The baked ricotta as everyone states is to die for, and the meatballs are also incredible so I really hope the staff can get their act together. Last night I think our server was Lisa, which we have had before and has been good in the past. Last night she was training a guy, which I'm sure can be difficult but I hate to make a bunch of excuses. I arrived later than my family and it took about 10 minutes to even acknowledge me and get my drink out on the table. I was told they were out of sangria which is a bummer so I ordered some black berry cocktail that was just subpar. I of course drank it way before the appetizer came out and would have loved to been offered another drink but never was. For the rest of my meal I had no other beverage, not even water. The trainee took our order on a notepad. My mom ordered the chicken to go for my dog (lol) the same time we all ordered our entrees. That food came out within 5 minutes! We're looking good... but then, only mine and my sister's meal come out. We tell one of the guys delivering it that we are still waiting on two more meals, in which he kindly said he would go check. Still haven't seen the waitress and about 15 minutes after that we see our trainee again in which we tell him we didn't receive two of the meals. He looked very confused and then went and finally ordered the entrees. I know he's new so I will cut him a break, but if you are writing it down how do you forget to ring it in? I don't even blame him though; he's new...but why wasn't he more closely followed or helped. I used to serve long ago so I didn't want to say anything but an apology should have happened and something should have been done to make up for the long wait it took to receive their food. I had to leave early to meet my friends, but by the time I left my mom's food was still not out. Hopefully, it was just a bad night for the both of them...",
