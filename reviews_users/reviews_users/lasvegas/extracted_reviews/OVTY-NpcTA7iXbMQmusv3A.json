    "text": "I've only been to a BJ's once - in San Diego - but had never tried the one in Las Vegas until last night.    It was Thursday night, and this place was jammed - pretty good, considering the economy, so I figured I was in for some super food.  I wasn't blown away by the meal, and the service was sub-par.  I had a turkey burger.  I didn't want fries, so I was able to substitute steamed broccoli.  The burger was okay - not bad, but as bland as could be.  It came with Swiss and slices of avocado, lettuce and tomato.   Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either.  The broccoli, though, was inedible.  It was partially cooked, but not that crisp, delicious stuff that Chinese restaurants do so well.  This was RUBBER.  I had the waitress bring me mashed potatoes instead.  They were good, but too salty (What else is new?).  My friend had the turkey burger, too, and felt the same way about hers - Average.  Our husbands both had Parmesan-crusted chicken, and they were satisfied.  Again, nothing to rave about.  I just don't get it.  There are so many places in town that have above-average food.  They offer hefty discounts.  And they're empty.  In my humble opinion, BJs, which rarely has coupons, has a menu that's not much different from any other similar chain restaurant, and has food and service that doesn't distinguish itself in any way, has a steady stream of customers.  And judging by the Thursday night crowd, probably has lines out the door on the weekends.  I think it's kind of sad.",

Very busy especially in the evenings. Make sure to call and ask how long the wait.   ***BE SURE TO END THE MEAL WITH A PIZOOKIE :)",

It was lunch hour and I understand it gets busy. Out server was Jose R and he seemed very nice at first. He took our drink orders and gave us time to look at the menus. When my friend ordered, he implied there's no lunch special for pasta on the menu.  If there isn't then why is it on the menu saying there is? He must of been offended by our question because he only came by once after that. It took 25 minutes to get our food and we were limited on time so it made the experience worst. for TWENTY minutes we had yet to see a waiter pass by. Not one came and refilled our drinks. We had to get the attention of another waiter to tell our waiter to pay attention to us. Our lunch was ruined by bad customer service. Definitely not coming back to this BJ brewhouse again.",

They do take big groups, but told us they could only separate the checks 4 ways max. Also, parking is a pain during busy evenings/weekends, especially since it is right next to Olive Garden.  I do not like their pastas. The pizza is delicious. The strawberry lemonade is fantastic, but they can never seem to make a good batch consistently. The pizookie (white chocolate & macadamia is my fave) is unforgettable.  I go here often, usually with friends, but it is far from my favorite. Their food is good, but none that I would ever be yearning for.  After you get all the blowjob jokes out of the way, don't forget to order a pizookie. It's the one \"for sure\" dish they have.",

BTW, the homemade orange cream soda was great.  I had a salad that was huge and flavorful, and the other two diners had fish and chips, which again were an enormous portion.  We split a mini deep dish pizza which we said on numerous occasions that it was supposed to be served as an appetizers.  We even ordered it 15 minutes before our entrees.  Low and behold, it came out at the same time as the entrees.  As for the drinks, the Frosty Peach was amazing.  I would go again just to get hammered on the drinks.",

It's a good size portion that can easily feed three people. It comes with caramelized onion dip and a buffalo sour cream. I prefer the caramelized onion dip because it doesn't take away from  the flavor of the chips. Their mini deep dish pizzas are delicious and cheap during happy hour. Their appetizer portions are enough to make you so full that sometimes you don't have room for their Pizookie! I also found out that they can make the Pizookie into a half ..half order. It's helpful when you share this with someone who is the complete opposite of you because they can customize it to your liking. I find eating here during happy hour is sometimes cheaper than eating fast food and it's more filling.",

We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip, and we were happy we did.  Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs, while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However, because I'm more of a noodle person, our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle.  And of course, we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options, she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time, we'll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead.  And lastly, be sure you get that \"$10 off $35\" deal. It ends on 4/6/2016.",

I can get pizza anywhere right?!?!  BRING ON THE RIBS!  OMG...super tender, just the right amount of sauce and the French Fries were uber hot and crispy and thin.  Just the way I like them. E of course got the jambalaya.  Didn't he get this before lol.  Yep just checked previous review....a creature of habit he is :) I am so bad at getting the names of the wait staff to include them in my reviews but yep....once again I didn't get it.  Shout Out to the gentleman who waited on us in the big booth on Saturday late afternoon in the bar area :)  He was nice, fast and not annoying checking in on us every 30 seconds yet not taking forever and a decade to come back and check in on us.   Awesome evening yet again at BJ's! idiotic self forgot to use my rewards card....oopsie!  Next time right?!?!",

We stopped in for lunch which I recommend since there are less crowds compared to dinner time and it's easier to find a parking spot-which is only one reason I've stayed away.  However, on this visit we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. The loud music and TVs are expected and this way you don't have to listen anyone else's conversation but your own.  Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish.  We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun.  Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious.  Overall high return factor.",

    "text": "This BJ's never seems to disappoint me. Today we were there for lunch and the waiter was so nice! Our food also came out very quickly today. I was surprised!  I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is.  We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe.   As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot.  Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!!  This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta. Their pizzas are yummy and shareable size! Over all, BJs is one of my favorite places to go!",

I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer.   Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before.   We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things.   Overall, I still love this restaurant, but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed.",

The order wasn't big, it was a pretty easy straight forward order.       I spoke to a girl name Brahel if I even spelled it correctly, she was very polite on the phone and took our order, so after ordering she read back what I said to her and then she gave a price and had no problem with it.        We went to go pick our food up and when we came home, the food we ordered wasn't there, only a portion of what we ordered was there, so I looked over my receipt and they charged me for exactly what I ordered, so I called them up stating I was missing items the girl Donna who answered the phone was very rude and said \" don't complain to me I didn't take your order \". She immediately sent me back to the ordering Department, so I was speaking with a manager.        The manager was polite and understanding, he said he would have someone deliver the missing items to our home. I called within 2 minutes of being home and noticing what was missing, we had to wait over an hour just to get the same wrong food....         The company doesn't obviously train people and specially have people listen. I called back and I had to explain again to the same manager that the items that I told him I paid for were still not there and he apologized again and said he would have them delivered, I said forget ir I just won't return.",

It had Pesto, Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Grilled Chicken, and I got the garlic aioli on the side.  And it comes with a side salad.  The salad was great.  It had some sort of citrus vinegar dressing.  I really enjoyed that.  However, there was something in the sandwich that set my mouth on fire.  I don't know if they put jalapenos in the pesto, but something was extremely spicy.  I could only eat half the sandwich.  And there wasn't a whole lot of chicken on it.  We each had some of the house root beer, which is excellent.  The service was also good and it was very clean in there.  I'd definitely eat here again, however I'm staying away from the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The other downside is that they share a parking lot with two other restaurants and when it is peak eating hours, it can be brutal trying to find parking or dodge bad drivers.",

Got the loaded potato skins and Margherita pizza was very good. Whole family really enjoyed their meals. Best part was our server Jared B. extremely attentive, friendly and went above and beyond for us. In a service town like Vegas it's so nice when you get A1 service!",

    "text": "So this is my new favorite chain restaurant since Yard House has been going downhill with the service and consistency.   With that said, it isn't perfect. We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long, the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane, for that whole area of restaurants there, especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway, let's move on to the good shall we?  The pizza - I think it is delicious, and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza, it is more of a deep dish, which I am usually not a fan of, but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom, balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu, but alas, the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too, so that is what we often get.   The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly, I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered, which probably says something, but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza.  Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two, they are really that good.  We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals, so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad, pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, generally busy and somewhat loud, lots of TV's going, etc., but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out.",

He said he would be back for our change and never came back. Okay, then he came back and said he will be right back. Great! I waited another 10 min as everyone else is getting their checks and leaving. By this time we have waited about 30 minutes total for our change. I would have given him all of our change, but it was the principal, knowing the change exceeds the 20% and expecting more than that. So, we asked if we can get our change back. He says, oh, you wanted your change back?He was a bit surprised. Not sure why he was surprised when he said, he would be back for our change. When he came back  to give us our change, he didn't give us all of it back. I still left him 20% tip, but I was bit irritated that I had to ask for the change back and not get all of it back. Hence the 2 stars for trying to take my money.",

First off our server forgot to give us straws with our water, but when he brought water to an older couple next to us he did not forget to give them straws or a cup of water filled with new ice. Our water looked like it's been sitting out for a while because the ice was almost melted.   & when they brought out our clam chowder they forgot to bring out crackers with it & it took forever to flag someone down for it.  Did I mention it was my boyfriend's birthday? It was a nice that they brought out a dessert for him, but they brought it out when I was in the bathroom. I mean, couldn't you wait a little bit until I came back out? He was sitting by himself with the damn dessert & a lit candle on it! (he didn't want to blow it out until I came back.)  Lastly, I usually get the jambalaya because it's one of the best I've had but today I tried the grilled chicken pasta & to my disappointment, it was totally bland.  I understand my boyfriend & I are young but that's no excuse to give us poor service. We still left the waiter 20%, undeservingly.  I only bumped it up an extra star because I usually come here & I never had a bad experience until today...on my boyfriends birthday. Such a shame.",

Small great white deep dish- More doughy almost like having pillowy bread with toppings than how Chicago style is. Good though.   Pizookie Trio- we got red velvet, chocolate macadamia, peanut butter. One plus is they don't skimp on the vanilla ice cream. I've never had these before as I don't really ever have space for dessert.   The service was great. Our server seemed to know how to pace themselves well in checking up on people and walking by to see if you need more drinks. The BF didn't know they make homemade sodas, but it was no issue for the server to switch to homemade rootbeer from ice tea. They brought us the check after putting our dessert order in so by the time we got dessert, we were all checked out. More servers need to do this! It's awesome not needing to wait for the check.    It's a decent chain specially if you like beers and homemade sodas.",

    "text": "Walked in tonight after 8pm and hostess asked how many in our party, how many children's menus and if we were Premier Rewards members. I advised we were Rewards members and she took my phone number right away to start our points earnings without delay. I love that! Sometimes I forget to scan receipts later to earn points.  We we're seated within a couple minutes and greeted by our server, Josh. We started off with our drink order and kids cheese pizza. Our drinks were brought by minus an ice water. Josh brought the second ice water, after I reminded him, right away.  We ordered the Ribeye 12oz (medium rare) with two sides (Caesar salad & loaded baked potato). The Ribeye was grilled to perfection! The center was a nice juicy red and I always eat mine with a side of Worcestershire. The baked potato was fresh and soft on the inside topped with butter, real bacon, cheddar cheese and sour cream with green onions on the side. The Caesar salad came out first and had the right amount of Parmesan and croutons to romaine lettuce ratio. The creamy dressing was mixed in the salad well. All in all a great meal!  #ilovesteak My daughter had the kids: mini deep dish cheese pizza which was light and fluffy and she ate almost all of it! #accomplishment    After dinner we of course ordered their famous Pizookie's for dessert. If you don't know, now you know.  A pizookie is a nice warm cookie fresh out of the oven in its own personal round pan topped with glorious mounds of ice cream!  Need I say more? They have several flavors and my husband actually tried a new one. It was Monkey Bread (dough baked with butter, cinnamon and sugar) topped with vanilla ice cream. AMAZING! I had my usual chocolate chunk cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. If you go on your birthday you get a pizookie Free! The prices are great here and I would say in the medium range. For example his burger was $13 and my steak was $23. They have one of the biggest menus I've ever seen. I asked a server once and they told me three guys who used to be with Cheesecake Factory opened up BJ's Brewhouse and that's why the menus compare with lots of variety. Our service and food were both great tonight. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the wood flooring surrounding the hosts desk which leads to restrooms was so oily or greasy I almost fell. Also when I went inside the women's restroom there were paper towels all over the sink, floors by trash cans and inside the bathroom stall. There was also lots of toilet paper on the floor. The bathroom was in shambles!",

Huge selections of beer as you would expect in a brewhouse, large selection of wines and mixed drinks.  Adequate food choices from dinners to. pizzas, salads, appetizers, everything was good. We got the corn fritter appetizer, very nice.",

Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good.  For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon!  Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly \"old\" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.    But the menu had some nice looking items, especially deserts that we might have to return for.",

It shows that the staff and management is not in tune with their customer's needs, and after 35 minutes of only seeing one server at our table I got up and left.   Thankfully there was a Taco Bell down the street that even with 7 cars stacked up in the drive through was able to get me in and out in under 10 minutes. I took someone out for lunch intending to give them a nice change from their lunch routine but the inattentive staff at this BJ's location ruined that idea.   1 Star.

First we ask for cokes and they kept giving us diet ones for some reason. We order poke bowl - don't get it, it never gets brought out but of course it's on the bill. Then my sister and I order the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and mine is great, but they brought out the classic chicken sandwich instead for my sister. Instead of making her the correct sandwich they brought out some microwaved hot sauce to put on it. My nephew never got his side of fries (yet again it was on the bill.) finally the booth and the wall behind us was so gross and dirty. Didn't look like it was wiped at all for maybe days?! A spider bit my fiance. I can't believe this happened to us especially while in summerlin! We spoke to Allen he was very nice and actually cared what was going on. Then the GM Paul came over and blamed all the errors on the waitress. And that wasn't the case. She took our order correctly and the people in the kitchen and servers where the ones messing things up. Along with the bus boys who clearly don't clean properly. He was so unprofessional and quick to place blame and had the nerve to say that we were \"complaining\" I let him know that customer service is his job and placing blame on someone won't solve the issue of the food being poorly prepared and the kitchen not making the food in the back. I let him know it's a difference between complaining vs facts. Facts was, the food wasn't good, the place was dirty and we didn't get our complete orders, yet was charged for them. Paul, as a GM please work on ownership and customer service skills. We will not be back. EVER. #bye!",

Does not matter which state or city... the atmosphere, the customer service, and even the food are all amazing. I like this location since its across the street from Red Rock Casino and in the Summerlin neighborhood.   Huge menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, steaks, specialty entrees, etc.. I can go on and on. The menu is seriously like a book!  I am the type that if there is a lot to choose from, I tend to get overwhelmed and indecisive! Hmm what does Miriam feel in the mood for today.   I have tried many different entrees during the years and majority of the appetizers, and there is not an item that I did not like. All very tasty. I was craving MEAT recently, and I ordered their new \"Black & Bleu burger\" and my friend got the \"Crispy Jalapeno burger.\"  The angus patty was SO JUICY! It hit the spot.   A MUST order is BJ's Famous PIZOOKIE. Pure DELICIOUSNESS.  Lots of flavors to choose from like red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate, and cookies n' cream. Well worth the calories!

I had to complain and the manager came right over and apologized right away.   Ordered the Potato Skins for the app. Since when do you deep fry potato skins? These were deep fried with no cheese, bacon or green onion. Just plain with sour cream sauce. Blah, gross!  Next up came the meal. The BF ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich with coleslaw. It was so bad he could not even choke it down. Usually he can eat anything, so this had to be bad. He said it was the worst tasting sandwich he had ever had. Mine was the Angel Hair Pasta that I have ordered several times here and it is usually good. The chef didn't drain the noodles so the bottom of the bowl was full of water, there was no sauce at all, just a few canned tomatoes and trust me, all I could taste was the metal from the can and a half of teaspoon of feta. This went back immediately. They brought me a bowl of their famous clam chowder to replace the pasta. Hahahah-- famous clam chowder?? You have got to be kidding me.   The only good thing was the beer that we had. They have their October Fest beer now and of course their famous Jeremiah Red. Funny how they are famous for so many things. NOT!!!",

The shits were cold, my Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade Was delicious.   As it was my birthday dinner I had a coupon for a free Pizookie, which is a giant chocolate chip cookie pizza. They made mine GF, and didn't charge an up charge. They come with ice cream on top. Our server Chanel brought us extra ice cream! Without us asking! Very nice touch.  The atmosphere is upbeat and a little loud, perfect for when Kayden wasn't happy. Several tvs on,  and drinking people, all led to a family feel.

    "text": "The portions here are surprisingly large. For a chain restaurant, the food quality is quite good. A very, very easy 4-star review. Have no fear about ordering here, you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you'll definitely not be disappointed.   My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken, I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it's a substitution, I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well.  A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with \"Sorry the salad is pre-made we can't do subtractions.\" BJ's just said \"okay\". That's a great first sight.  As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins.   Let me just review all the food at once: for the price, I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great, the food was cooked well, the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins, and was a pleasant surprise for the salads.  I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good -- really good, just what I was looking for and up to my standards -- it is still a chain restaurant, and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way.   BJ's is definitely one of my go-to restaurants for classic, totally solid American-style food (even though I ordered a mexican-inspired entree salad and an asian-inspired appetizer).",

    "text": "\"What do you want to eat?\" \"I don't know, what do you want to eat?\"   We've all had these questions asked to us before by someone and BJ's is the spot to be. Are you craving pizza? They have that. Are you craving some Fish n' Chips? Has your stomach been telling you that you want pasta? Well look no further as BJ's has essentially a little bit of everything. I've been to BJ's countless times and not once have I ever been disappointed with my food or service, so a review for them is long overdue. I was here a few days ago on a Wednesday night and they were packed, so you know this place has to be good. Luckily my sister and I were seated just in time before there was a wait. Even though the place packed our server consistently checked up on us and always made sure our water was filled. Their selection and variety of appetizers, entrees, sides, and mini-appetizers are plentiful. You are bound to find something on the menu that'll interest you or satisfy your craving.  Our order consisted of:  An order of the calamari An order of the Caesar's salad An order of the fish n' chips An order of a small deep dish pizza And you always have to make room for dessert especially their pizookie, which is basically a pizza-cookie topped with Vanilla ice cream. Can't decide on a specific flavor? You have the option to split the pizookie in half. My sister got the chocolate chip while I got the cookies n' cream.  For a place I've been to countless times and have always been satisfied with my food and service, BJ definitely deserves that 5 stars.  NOTE: Sadly they no longer offer thin fries or waffle fries and only have natural cut fries.",

They were both cooked exactly as we ordered. Very good burgers. Very clean restaurant. Restrooms were clean and well stocked.  Would definitely  come back when in the neighborhood.

Plus its tough to stay healthy with that bazooki! The wait is always long so that's a good sign, and if you like quantity this is the place. My last visit, I had the ahi salad which is very tasty and a friend had a huge burger which was good as well. But other than the bazooki, there's nothing I crave and feel the need to rush back for. But I must say, service the last few times was really great and the kids had a free meal due to the school's honor roll rewards.",

Of course, seeing your favorite sports teams on TV are a great accompaniment to any dining experience. Great takeout menu.  Call ahead and they can even bring it to your vehicle.  Prices are average, and the crowd is pretty laid-back.  This is not innovative dining, people, but it is largely satisfying and reliable.  The tables and chairs are comfortable, and the temperature is well-regulated.  You are not going to want to cross town to try it out, but if you are tired and hungry after a day of shopping or work, and in the neighborhood of Summerlin, sure, why not?",

I also asked if they could put the Angels game on one of the TVs. The manager said he would when the game started at 8.....what baseball game starts at 8pm??? At 7:48, it was already the top of the 3rd inning. I guess we needed the Cubs Brewers game on every TV. Tried the zucchini strings, which tasted like a pile of grease powder....f'n nasty.  Prices increased and portions are smaller. Cinnamon Toast Crunch pizookie was good, so it earned my 1 star rating. Don't know if I'll be back any time soon.",

The salmon in the salad was severely undercooked.  It was so undercooked, it would have made a sensitive person sick.  The grilled chicken was cold and rubbery (no way it got that cold during the drive to our house.  When alerted about the problem, BJ's manager Norine would not even get on the phone with me to discuss the problem.  I emailed a complaint to BJ's corporate and Paul the higher manager called me and left a message that he would call back.  That was 2 months ago.  We have never returned.",

No big deal, we will eat them rather than risk the rest of our food being spit in.  Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around, sees that we have not been served  our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food.  My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way.  Nora, our waitress, was no where to be found, so we asked another server to get the manager.  Nora finally came over and went to get her manager.  William M, one of the managers, came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost. We did not have time to waste another 30 minutes for our food to be remade. He said he was going to talk to his staff about the quality of food that is served. Nora knew full well that the food she was serving us wasn't the BJ's quality standards that the manager was talking about.  We go back to BJ's because we really like the food. This wasn't the first time our food was served cold or our order was lost or my rewards card was lost. For those reasons, we Will NOT be going back to BJ's. We have given this enough chances to this restraurant. We will take our business else where.",

When we asked for lemon for our water the waitress brought a lot of lemon.  Cons: We were starving when we arrived and waited 30min just to order drinks. The waitress rushed off before we had a chance to order food. Another 30min went by before she brought our beers and we were so frustrated from waiting an hour we just asked for our check. It took the waitress another 10min to bring us our check 20 to pick up the check and 20 to bring it back to us. after about an 1 hour and 45min of waiting  I was so disappointed in the service. I might come back and give it another chance. Hopefully it will be better next time.",

    "text": "I have two words for you: pi-zookie  In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .  All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key.   In closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO",

    "text": "The number one reason to come here is the pizookie. Sure, it's something that I can easily make at home, but I'm way too lazy. It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it, a piping hot, moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share, but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us.  The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients, but large enough to appease any hearty appetite.  The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart, but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare, but it hit the spot.  The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers, etc. So, chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater.  3.5 Stars",

Since I bought more than 14$ of food I asked for our free pizooki after her taking 20 minutes to come when we asked another server for her. She then gave us sass once again when we asked for the free pizooki. She argued with us saying we couldn't get the free one, then walked away and came back as soon as we asked ANOTHER server Brittany for our free pizookis and she didn't blink an eye and got us one.  She didn't refill our drinks. I love BJ's but the service was terrible. Patricia was a rude server.",

She had great recommendations, especially with their seasonal Pumpkin Ale, which was absolutely delicious!   For apps we enjoyed crispy wontons, with tai dipping sauce & fried artichoke fritters. Wontons definitely won that battle.  For entrees, my wife enjoyed a classic Bacon Burger, and I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was great. Its rather large, so just remember that when ordering.   For dessert we wanted a trio of Pazookies, and received 2 of which we ordered, and 1 which was not. They corrected the situation immediately which was nice.  The one suggestion I will make is, I would love a brief description on the food after its delivered to the table by the food runners. Always nice to be reminded of what was ordered.   We had a great, laughter filled evening and will definitely come back. Thanks Destiny!",

Only reason I give it three stars is because it's difficult to order as a vegan. You have to take a regular menu item and modify it to where it's not even close to what it was. No vegan cheese for pizza. Marinara sauce and veggies is all you can get. Salads have no option for a no meat topping like tofu or chikn. . So you pay $15 for a chicken salad with dressing. Then you ask for no chicken and balsamic and oil. The cost is the same. So lettuce for $15.  Think the only thing you can order straight off the menu is soup and maybe the portabella salad.  Good place though. Used to it being hard to eat out. Just wish they'd make a page in the menu to make it easier on the waitstaff and the customer who's vegan.",

I totally have no complaints. They even have a rewards program. For every $1 you spend you earn points to free food. I also unlocked a free appetizer thru Yelp!  So yes I'm was winning at this restaurant. Stop in and check them out!!!!!",

Yes cooked into her onion strings! It was hanging out of her mouth which i saw which is why she knew. My little sons pizza I ordered just cheese it came with Tomatoes in it which he won't eat so she offered to make another which was very nice. He was very hungry though. When the new one came out it was burned and all the cheese was baked off!  My moms chicken looked like they microwaved an old breast and was dry! Not wor u the $12! They kindly discounted those 2 items from the bill. Offered the kids and us ice cream on the house... which I was still charged half for! And mine never even came out. I will never return. And I'm sad because the pzookies and wings are usually good. Horrible experience!!",

It took awhile for the waitress to get our order because they were very busy.  However, we didn't wait very long for our food.

Tips: Call ahead of time to put your name down on the call list and sign up for their loyalty program, you will not regret it.   I walked in at 8 PM and it was packed. Every single table was filled and there were at least 3 families ahead of mine, but we only waited for six minutes to be seated. It was awesome. Reminder: Call ahead of time.   The server I got was awesome. Juan was attentive towards myself and my family. He always refilled our waters before it hit the \"half-way\" line and always checked to make sure everything was going well.   The food was absolutely delicious. I never have any complaints about their food. The environment was also great. They have huge tv screens for sport fans like myself. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!",

Hostess began to seat us at a table, i asked the hostess for a booth instead.  My hubby went to the bathroom and when he was coming back, he overheard the hostess talking bad about me requesting a booth to some of the other waitresses. Then another group, right behind us, sat down after us and they got there drinks right away. We were still waiting to even be asked what we wanted to drink. After she asked what they wanted to order we figured out we were being ignored, obviously over asking for a booth. We just left and threw away the gift card that we had recieved for christmas. Really the only reason we went there. Never again. Tell your friends and relatives to get gift cards from somewhere else.",

    "text": "We've been eating at BJ's on West Charleston since we moved here.  With a large assortment of menu choices, a kid's menu, and a nice beer selection (including BJ's own delicious assortment of brews), there's something here for everyone.    If you've never been before, or you get lost in the large menu, I'd recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes (artichoke hearts) or the Avocado Egg Rolls for a starter.  Moving on to main course choices, try the Bacon Cheese Burger, New Orlean's Jambalaya, or one of the Tavern Cut Pizzas.  The Spicy Pig or Garlic Chicken Pesto are both favorites.  If you're in the mood for salad as a main course, definitely check out the Kale & Roasted Brussel Sprouts Salad.  There is also a good assortment of dessert options for anyone who is still hungry after the meal.  Finally, there's a gluten-free menu for those who want or need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.  In the larger restaurants in the chain, the noise level is slightly above average, and has even been noisy at times, but it's never been too loud.  As I mentioned, BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from.  They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well, so you're not bound to their own brews.  By the way, the in-house root beer is delicious.  Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits.  Finally, the West Charleston location is conveniently located near Red Rock Casino and Downtown Summerlin, so consider adding this BJ's to your dining choices if you're out and about in the area.  They're consistently good and worth a visit.  Enjoy!",

They have a large menu with the usual apps (wings, southwest eggrolls), pastas, burgers, salads, and pizza.  My husband and I come here for their deep dish pizza- the crust is buttery and cooked to perfection.  Their traditional cheese is delicious and topped with chunks of tomatoes, and they have great specialty pizzas like bbq chicken or spinach and artichoke.  Dessert here is also the bomb- deep dish baked to order cookies called pizookies, available in different flavors and topped with ice cream (my fav is the oreo).",

We were seated before noon, not served until 12:50!  We will not go back.",

It took us forever to even get our salads-as we asked the waitress while she planning on walking right by us after sitting there just waiting & waiting-she then walked right into the back & seconds later came out with them (obviously they had been there for some time).  Our pizza was uncooked & we seemed to be more of a hassle to our waitress than a customer.   I since have contacted the corporate office by e-mail with no return & also verbally left a message on the corporate number with no return, this is definitely bad customer service on many levels.",

This visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA.  The food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.  My Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!  Overall, another awesome experience @ BJ's!  Will I return?  Hell ya!",

I had the grilled turkey cobb which was very good and finished it off with a white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. The pazookie was good, though not as thick as I anticipated. I really enjoyed the vanilla bean ice cream topper though - very nice touch. Service was good and fast. They also have a take out entrance. I'll eat here again, though it was a little pricey for me.

Offered on Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 7 pm, and reverse happy hour on Sundays through Thursdays from 10 pm to closing.  $1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails Half off all Mini Pizzas $2 off all appetizers (BJ's Snacks & Small Bites not included)  You can only take advantage of their happy hour in the bar area - so cozy up to the booth or the high tables!  For our party of three, we shared three flatbreads and we enjoyed them all!  * Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage \"Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses, fresh basil with a hint of oregano, sliced Roma tomatoes and a touch of Italian sausage.\" ($8.95)  * California Club \"Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado.\" ($8.95)  * Grilled Chicken Pesto \"Basil pesto sauce drizzled over mozzarella and fresh Parmesan cheeses then topped with grilled chicken, red onions and sun-dried tomatoes.\" ($8.95)  I can't remember which one was my favorite, but I know we were impressed by all of them and happily finished them.  I also enjoyed their Double Berry (10 oz) \"Berry Burst Cider & Lindeman's Framboise\" ($5.95), which is part of the HH.   It definitely gets packed though during these hours, so get in there early.  We barely got up from our booth when another party was happy to take it over.   It's a busy restaurant with means the noise level is high and parking can be challenging.",

My boyfriend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pizza and each of us got a side salad as well.  The salad tasted like the ones that you buy in the pre-mixed bags, flavorless and too wet.  The pizza was very comparable to Pizza Hut.  Its a shame they compare it to Chicago style deep dish pizza because it doesnt even come close to that!! I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant.  The service was pretty bad.  We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people.  So we walk in and she says it'll be about 5 minutes.  We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever.  We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us \"oh, you can just go seat yourself over there\"  Ummm okay.  Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes.  We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another.  My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes.  If he was a bit more attentive I would've enjoyed my experience a lot more.  Medium pizza, 2 side salads, one pint of beer, and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40.  All in all, it was nothing special. It tasted like Pizza Hut on a good night but tripple the price!!",

I took my wife and her parents and we went on a Sat afternoon - busy but not incredibly busy.  What went wrong??  .....ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup (without soup crackers).  I had to track down server and tell him.  He said he would bring another cup...it never came.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it came out with LESS THAN ROOM TEMP fries.  If that wasn't enough...the grilled sourdough from the sandwich was COLD!!  Needless to say, I provided feedback, did not accept any other food or compensation and will NEVER return!  Even though I can't stand Denny's I would have rather eaten there!!!  YUCK! Save your money and avoid this place!",

However, BJ's was a wonderful surprise and our new go-to when we want good food and to stay close to home. My favourite beer is the hefewisen (I'm not sure about the spelling).  I mentioned to the waiter that I liked Blue Moon and Shocktop, he suggested that beer, and I'm now hooked.  The pizza, calzones, and burgers are awesome.  My dad even orders a pizza and a burger because they are both so tasty, he takes one home to eat later! The service has always been prompt and friendly, it's not too loud or crowded, the TVs are plentiful and high enough so everyone has a good view of whatever game is going on, and the prices are reasonable, especially for Summerlin.  Our new favourite hangout :)",

Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders.  The food was good but not great.

I understand that establishments are weary to serve teenagers, but that's no reason to be treated like we're below the status of a regular customer. Every time our server spoke to us, I felt like we were being scoffed at. Not every teenager tips just below the minimum, so if that was the reason why the service was horrible, you won't be seeing me or my family here anytime soon. My party isn't stupid, we know the norms of tipping and dining out. I was excited to bring my foreign exchange student here to enjoy the highly regarded burgers, but the embarrassment my whole party experienced overshadowed it all. the waiter actually had the guts to scream at her because she couldn't hear him when he brought all the food to our table. first of all, the place is always filled with people, resulting in a volume problem. Second, she doesn't speak good English! we seriously had to endure him directly shouting at her and giving us attitude when she didn't speak up saying it wasn't her food, even going as far as to say \"you need to speak up next time.\" I haven't even stopped laughing because, really, this will be the last time me and my party will dine here after this experience. Bj's should know not every patron is the same, so why were we treated like every other  teenager who dines out? pathetic.",

We avoid gluten so it's always interesting and sometimes difficult to find things on any menu that are gluten free. Our server was very knowledgeable about what was gluten free on their menu and what was not. We went for the gluten free crust pizzas and ordered the buffalo chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas. They only come in 10\" but that was plenty for the 2 of us. They were delicious and quite satisfying. I did try one of their beers that the server said was a reduced gluten beer. I took my chances and drank it. It was a delicious IPA, can't remember the name of it... afterward we had the gluten free Pizookie. It is basically a warm gluten free chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream in the center. We enjoyed it very much. BJ's is a great restaurant for people who want good food selection as well as a solid beer selection. I'll definitely be going back soon and asking for the reduced gluten free IPA again.",

And - their multi server approach to food delivery makes sense in theory, but doesn't do well in reality:        At our last visit our server took our order, after about 10 minutes my partner's soup and salad was delivered first (by another employee) when only the salad was requested to come first (so the soup was sent back).       10 minutes into the salad my entree was delivered (by another employee), but neither of us had  received our drinks yet.        10 minutes into my entree the drinks finally arrived, my partner requested her soup.       10-15 minutes later I finished my entree and my partners soup arrived (yet another employee)...      Not sure where our regular server was DURING our meal, didn't see her again until the end of it all.      Enjoy the BJ's menu, but the combination of having to wait in line to pay inflated prices and have sloppy service may ultimately send me elsewhere.",

Now, it is not a big deal, however it slightly needs to be improved, as I didn't think the restaurant was busy enough. When it gets busier it is understandable, of course. I had a chicken sandwich meal which was great and very substantial. Their draft beers are amazing. Will definitely go back to BJs anytime soon.",

I usually get the steak and it comes with asparagus and mashed potato. I order my steak in medium rare to capture all of the flavor! If you haven't tried medium rare, you should definitely try!  I miss the red velvet pizookie, but I can settle for the white chocolate macadamia pizookie! Never disappoints. Who doesn't love a pizza cookie with some ice cream smothered on top? The hot and cold mixed tastes great!  Service was quick and waters were refilled pretty fast.",

    "text": "Wow. Really impressed. This is a chain restaurant? My dad and step mom took myself and kids here after a long day of planes, walking and driving. I was famished and would have devoured anything put in front of me.  First of all, very nice space. Cozy, yet spacious. Modern, but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect, even for my overly-impatient father!  Drinks came out quickly, my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks, and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal.  The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced!  Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs, 8 of them! Fries were yummy too!  I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food, satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side, since almost always they drench it down, but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay, but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish.  Easy five stars. I wish I was this satisfied with the value, quality of food & service, as well as the overall experience every time I dined out.",

There is a dish for everyone in your party.  They have a great beer selection... a variety of in house and craft brews for you to choose from.

The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a \"Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad\" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a \"Kids Pizza\" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy!   They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program.",

We asked to be seated outside for 2 people and 2 high chairs.  We were brought to the outdoor seating.   We sat there for over 10 minutes and no one came at all.  I went  back to hostess desk and said I didn't think they knew we were out there cause no one came to our table yet.  They apologized and said they would get someone to help us.   Another 5 minutes went by. Still no one.  I said we were waiting 3 more minutes and if no one came, we would leave.   NO one came.  The kids by this time were getting fussy.   We got up to leave.

My favorite item to order there is their California Chicken Sandwich.  I'm not a huge fan of avocado, but the combination of avocado with green chiles and the juiciness of the chicken is just out of this world!  Of course, you can't talk about BJ's without mentioning the Pizzookie!  I can't tell you how many of these I've tried, but it's a lot!  They're just the most delectable dessert in the world!

It very closely mirrors the quality of what I've experienced in Maui. After sharing that, I order the Cherry Glazed Salmon to go. Both were amazing.  The restaurant is in between casual and formal. The bar is well-stocked, and the ambience is really nice. The place is fairly dimly lit, but just enough so you can still see your dining mates and your plate.   We only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a booth, but once we were seated, we didn't have any servers checking on us for another 20 minutes, which we weren't thrilled about. I think that other than being pretty short-staffed, it's a pretty great place.",

First my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo she asked for NO broccoli when she got it there was broccoli on it. Second I ordered a cherry Pepsi I got that but asked for a little more grenadine on the side it took 20 min to get it cause he forgot about it. Then I wasn't sure what I wanted so the waiter recommend this one burger so I asked if it had there special sauce on it and he said no then I asked if there was cheese on it and he said yes then I asked what else was on it and he said just bbq sauce so I got that he didn't tell me anything else that was on there, well when I got my food it had no cheese it had the special sauce on it and he failed to tell me there was green peppers and chopped tomatoes and onions on it. We told them about my daughters and when the bill came I was still charged for her food. My husband got the triple decker and asked the waiter for No mayonnaise and when he got his there once again mayonnaise on it. I understand there are going to be mess ups and I'm ok with that but on everyone's food that I had with me is a little much if you don't remember what people ask for you sure need to write it down. And one more thing every time if we need anything he never stopped at the table it was just a walk by is everything ok or do u want dessert . Not a good waiter.",

    "text": "Bj\"s  is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with.  Some of the items, I just love some are not so great in my opinion.  First things first parking can be a hassle at times, and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend.  I like the atmosphere and decor very much.  The wait staff is pleasant enough, yet often make mistakes with our orders.  In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there.  Now, the food.  They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top.  My son and I love the Tomato Soup, truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons.  I usually start to get full with just my soup.  On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo, she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry.  I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch!  My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion, or their ribs both are very tasty.  I waiver between their New york strip, which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu.  I personally am not impressed with their pasta  dishes, find them a bit tasteless.  Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great.....  I can't ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert.  My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky, I'm sure I've misspelled that....l.o.l. yet  a sinful and  necessary experience!  Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00  for the three of us.  Bj's is always a family favorite, with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too.  Bottom line is, if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to, always seems to be Bj's a leading contender!  Marisol Juracka, LV, Nv",

    "text": "I never thought I'd see myself reviewing conglomerate type restaurant like BJ's.  However my most recent experience inspired me to take a few minutes to spread the gospel on some great things that most people are probably missing out on.  First off their fish & chips have the most uniquely delicious batters I have ever encountered.  I don't know how they do it, but the batter is flavorful, crispy and surprisingly flaky.  It absorbs the malt vinegar or lemon juice while still maintaining its crunchiness.  Every other beer batter I've tried, the vinegar or lemon juice just glides right off and makes the batter soggy.  They've learned how to break the laws of physics with this magical beer batter.  Second notable item offered at BJ's is their Irish Root Beer, which is their micro-brew root beer mixed with Jameson, Butterscotch Schnapps, and Bailey's.  The drink comes out frothy, messy, and overflowing like a great root beer float.  If you've never tried it before, you don't know what to expect when you taste it.  The best way to describe this flavor of this drink is with words from that guy in that Daffy Duck cartoon.  BJ's Irish Root Beer is... \"Amazing! Marvelous! Stupendous! Colossal! Tremendous! Gigantic! Astounding! Unbelievable! Spectacular! Phenomenal! And it's good, too.\"",

I'm not a beer drinker but occasionally go here for lunch because they have a decent-sized menu, reasonably-priced lunch specials and plenty of tables with almost no wait time. I recommend trying their Southern fried chicken resting on a bed of cheddar mashed potatoes and corn. BJ's also offers \"enlightened\" items, food that's healthy and relatively low calorie. One of my lunchtime favorites is the Maui pork chop. Just one grilled bone-in chop with a sweet glaze, served with potatoes and crisp green beans. Finish off the meal with their famous Pizookie, a cookie baked fresh out of the oven and topped with ice cream. It's to die for.",

Very fresh ingredients and I liked how they use fresh cut tomato instead of tomato sauce in the pie.  BJs offers an extensive menu and is an excellent choice for a family gathering.  Very kid friendly and excellent food.  I will definately be back and would recommend this restaurant to others....",

I saw a waitress serving other cars, but she didn't bother coming up to mine. After waiting over 10 minutes, I simply left.

    "text": "We stopped in to BJs for lunch after hiking in the Red Rock canyons. We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks, to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them.  He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'.  We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order.   The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table, presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy, but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon, so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again,my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok, he may have TOLD him to :-))  I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it, after all of this, no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage, idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly.   Having said all that, we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good, the mac and cheese was excellent, the chopped salad was great and huge, and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it. They also made a very tasty margarita, so it's worth another visit.",

BUT, if you go there for the food, you won't be disappointed.  From their Avacodo Egg Rolls to their Chicago-esque pizza, they know how to make their food.  They recently added \"small plates\" to their menu, 8 -10 mini appetizers for between 2-4 dollars each.  We decided to sample as many as we could and ordered Thai won tons, meatballs, a mozzerella salad, and fried artichokes.  The Artichokes were surprisingly good with large pieces of artichoke beneath a breading that didn't zap the flavor of the choke.  The dipping sauce was good but not perfect.  The meatballs failed miserably as they stunk like yesterday's laundry.  They tasted ok but the smell really curdled our appetite.  Luckily the Thai chicken won tons were excellent.  Add to that a wedge salad, housebrewed root beer and cream soda, and a kids meal and the three of us got out for under $40.00 with full tummies!  And the kids Pazooki comes with their meal and is big enough fo the adults to sample without stuffing it in.",

If a dessert outshines the beer at a brewery, something is amiss. -This pub is a local favorite so it gets very crowded and noisy around happy hour.  BOTTOM LINE Go there for an appetizer and then the Pizookie. If it is your first time, get the mini trio. Do not try to get an entree and then the Pizzokie or you'll be sorry. My wife and I enjoy microbreweries and independents but decided to try this chain (107 restaurants as of June 2011). It was a good dessert experience, but we probably wouldn't go there again.",

This is good place to go with a group, keep in mind that it is impossible to get a table on a Friday night.    I find this place on the spendy side. However, the lunch and happy hour specials are a good deal, so try it hit those if you're a miserly cheapskate like me.   Tenaya Creek offers better beers, Big Dogs boasts more enticing food options; BJ's is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood.   Minus a point because it is, and feels like, a corporate chain.",

You must save room for dessert! Try a pizookie! It's a fresh baked cookie with ice cream.  They come in different flavors-chocolate chip, cookies n cream, oatmeal, chocolate, and white chocolate macadamia. For drinks, try a snake bite (guiness+pear cider), berry burst cider, or any of their own brews.  Their root beear and cream sodas are really tasty too.  You won't be disappointed.

Tonight we had avocado egg rolls (not as good as Cheesecake Factory) and an individual sized hand tossed pizza. They let us do half BBQ chicken and half spicy meatball. Some places don't let you do half and half if there are two different sauce bases (which is ridiculous, but I appreciate it even more when they do it).  Both were good, but the best thing is that we got Happy Hour prices even though we showed up at around 7:15! Our waitress told us that if the game is still on (its Thursday night football), the HH prices continue. Sweet!",

It's one of the most delicious desserts in town.  It's a homemade cookie I. A deep dish pizza pan cooked 3/4 of the way through top end with a n amazing vanilla ice-cream.  The bar is hopping with dozens of beer options on tap and in bottles.  Menu is huge and all over the place, I'm not a big fan of the entrees.  Apps are good and dessert is fantastic!",

    "text": "Went to this restaurant for dinner with the hubby - loved the food but the service could have been better.   I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too.   Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a \"date night\" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed.  Overall the great food way outweighed the lack of basic service and I would go back again. Next time I'll request to space out the courses.",

I have had nothing but good service here and I prefer this place over the Yard House simply because it is not loud and overbearing at night.    On the many visits here, I've had the Turkey Burger (it was moist and delicious), the Rib-Eye at medium rare (perfect!), the Thai Chicken Mango Salad, (the sweet dressing really makes it POP with bright flavor, and the Santa Fe Salad (the fire roasted red peppers, jack / cheddar cheese, avocado and corn make this Santa Fe Salad one of my top Southwestern Salad favorites out of any restaurant...)  For desert, we sometimes get the PIZZOOKIE!  Chocolaty goodness is yours to behold!  Definitely try it if you have room for it at the end.  It's very worth it.  The servers are usually quick and on top their game.  The restaurant is very clean and neat.  The ambiance is very casual and perfect for a date.  I'll be coming back here for sure.",

    "text": "Our trip to Vegas ended with neither a bang nor a whimper and that was fine by me. After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon, we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill, but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options, this brewpub clearly has their act together.  BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves, and I can understand why, since this place seems equally enjoyable for families, singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity.  The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider, but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees, portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream.  For the food alone, this is a three-star joint, but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough, my local sports bar has a very similar name.",

It was supposed to have alot of veggies and snow peas but only had a couple and good rice. But it tasted good with alot of chicken. The the Californificatiin  flatbread, it was good but the mayo sauce drizzle was kinda nasty so I took it off.

If you like IPAs, I recommend their Tempest IPA, which isn't on the menu. Secret IPA for the win!  The last time I was there, it was for the World Cup 2010 Final. We chose this venue because our buddy had $70 in gift cards. It's really not the best spot to watch sports, but it served its purpose.  On this visit, I ordered their Jambalaya. I wasn't completely sold on it. I don't mind spicy, but this one was to the point of barely tasting the dish. In the past, I've had their deep dish pizza. I remember it being pretty good.",

So we will wait for our food as it has now been about 30 minutes since the order was so simple. First and most definitely the last time we'll come here. To top it off the server is not too excited to be here. The excuse was another big party was tying to get food. That tip is probably bigger and therefore more important since we are simple soup and salad. Thanks but no thanks.",

    "text": "I've never been a huge fan of BJ's restaurants. They seem to offer all my favorite things, beer and food, but the place has never really grown on me.   On this occasion, I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza. I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza, but they no longer serve them in the pan, which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either.   I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.  Overall, it's not my favorite restaurant chain, but it does in a pinch. I just haven't found the menu item of my dreams here yet.",

It's always been because either Yard House (at Red Rock) is too busy or I happen to be on that side of Charleston.    As for the food.  Probably tried almost everything on the menu at some point.  My favorites include their Spinach Dip, Salmon, Lasagna, Pazookie, and their Great White Pizza.  If you haven't tried their Pazookie, then you must try at least once. I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip.    My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza.  Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo.  I love it when they burn the crust a little.  Sometimes I request it.   Service is just average, but really good during lunch.  I have to say, service is better than Yard House across the street.    Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat.  One things for sure, getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California.",

My husband and I each had a beer (IPA for him, pale ale for me), and they were both really good. We split an appetizer of mini bruschetta, which I thought was pretty tasty. (Too much bread-to-topping ratio for my spouse, but he's not really a bread person like me!) He had the pulled pork sandwich, and I had the Asian chopped salad. Yummy fried onions on the sandwich, and the meat was nicely smoked. He was quite pleased! My salad was fine, nothing special, but the portion size was reasonable and thankfully the salad itself was not overdressed.  Our waitress was a little overeager, and the back room was a little cold, but otherwise there's not much to complain about. The food was good; the beer was great; and I'm sure we'll be back when we're on that side of town.",

We both have eaten at this location numerous times before and have been pleased with the food in the past but something has changed. My only big complaint is the food. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which came out with NO salad dressing... like how does a salad come out with no dressing?! Also when my boyfriends food arrived the man who gave it to him spilled his ranch all over his plate and said \"your ranch spilled on the plate\", didn't ask to help or to get another ranch. We both thought it was pretty rude. Ok service but sucky food!!!",

    "text": "For a chain restaurant you think their training would be excellent and their customer service would be off the charts... not the case with this location.  We came in at 3pm on Saturday, plenty of open tables but still a decent crowd. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before someone came to our table. When they did, she grabbed the pepper shaker to give to another server, did not say hello or even acknowledge us. Turns out, she was our server.  When she came to get our drink order another 5 minutes later, we had so much time with the menu we asked if we could put in our order. All simple food, tacos, wings, soup & salad.  A salad was served at our table, way before our drinks. We then waited 22 minutes for our food. Yes, I timed it because everything else was taking so long. Finally our food came except for the bowl of soup. Refills were done before the soup was delivered to the table. While waiting I noticed plenty of servers at the hostess stand having free time, talking, singing and joking around. By the time my soup arrived, one of my friends had already finished her meal, and a second person was almost done.  We were there over an hour and a half. No apologies for slow service, it was as though it was the norm. I also don't appreciate servers using pet names (baby, honey, love) when taking your order or serving your food and drink.  The food was good, but with that kind of service, it's not worth the time.",

There location is in a great area near red rock hotel and casino and downtown summerlin. They even have their vegan options clearly labeled and the calories of everything on the menu! So why only two stars?... service. It's a busy spot... even on a Tuesday night we waited 30 min... they had a server walking around with an app of their featured pizza which was nice  for people to munch on while they waited.   We sat in the booth and we were greeted rather promptly. We placed an app order for the kids since they were hungry and ordered some drinks. Everything came out fast... but we had to steal silverware from an empty table, even after we asked twice for some. When they were about halfway done we placed the order for our meal...   This is where is went all down hill. I ordered the superfood veggie bowl. The kids each ordered their mini hot dogs and my boyfriend ordered chicken and asparagus... the food took about 35 min to hit the table...  okay... they were busy. But the food was cold. So cold that I took a bite and handed it back to the server to tell her it wasn't even warm. She didn't offer to remake or reheat it... so I just asked her to take it off the bill. My boyfriends chicken was pink... and his food was also cold. The kids ate their food after we checked it to make sure it was cooked properly. We got the bill from the server. No apology. Nothing to even try to rectify the situation. The service was not up to par and neither was the food. The Henderson location had way better service and I would return there, if I lived in the area. I would say give it a try... late night or early in the day... when it isn't so busy.",

Donna the hostess was able to get us in sooner rather than 45 mins later after she shimmied a few tables around. Thank you for being on your toes and thinking outside of the box. We really appreciated it. And as for our server Anthony. This was our second time having him be our server. He was our server last year when we came to watch the first playoff game last year. He did a phenomenal job then and and he did a superb job this time around. We were a table of 6 and I noticed he had about 3-4 other tables ranging from 4-5 tops along with ours. i don't know how he did with the other tables, but he was very attentive with us and was very understanding of us being there to watch the game as well. He made sure we got our drinks and apps in quick and gave us ample time to decide on what we wanted to dine on. He also double checked on certain orders to make sure we wanted them and not original or similar items that used to be on the menu. He wanted to make sure we got what we were looking for. Food was served at the BJ's standards. No one was disappointed in anything they ordered. For apps we ordered the zucchini strings and crispy fried artichokes. For dinner - The baked ziti was ordered that came with a garlic knot, massive parmesan crusted chicken that could feed 3 people, the juicy top sirloin, the flavorful chimichurri chicken and the cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries. All was so good. And we topped off the night with their gigantic beignet and pizookie. SO YUM!",

BJ's also has amazing desserts. If you look in the back of the menu, you will see the phenomenal pizookies. These pizza shaped cookies with ice cream on top come in all different flavors and taste delicious. Overall, I would recommend BJ's to anyone.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my experience at BJ's Restaurant. We had a group of six and decided on BJs because  of the variety of entrees for everyone. I went online and put us on waitlist so when we got there the wait was only 10 minutes.  Our waiter was great and had a lot of fun with our group. The food came out fast and was delicious. We had calamari and spinach dip for our appetizers and both was seasoned well. I had the double pork chop, Brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes. The pork chop was huge so I split it and took some home. The chop was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just honey Dijon. Also if your not a beer drinker get the Libemans Fambroise it is sweet and light. Overall wonderful dinner with family and friends.",

Bjs had a great selection in menu, that is the main reason I recommended coming here because I didn't know what my friend wanted. When I came in the host was friendly and after a short wait, was taken to our table. Getting the initial hello took the server somewhat longer. After the greeting, everything was fine. We got our food, my friend ordered a burger, I got the turkey pulled sandwich. He had no complaints I thought mine was a little dry, bread hard, nothing to write home about. My friend was thirsty and needed another soda. After a period of waiting, the server was going to get a refill. After 5 to 7 minutes and seeing a manager talking with 5 servers (which one was ours), my friend got up with is glass to get the soda. The place was busy so the conversation with all of them didn't make sense. Anyway, I'll maybe give it another shot, but just might go to the one by my house instead.",

The food is generally good as is the service, but neither are much to cheer about.  I ordered the all-you-can-eat soup/salad lunch combo. The Caprese salad was great! [I didn't get the wedge salad because I don't see the point of eating 1/4 of a head of lettuce with a drizzle of dressing.] The Caesar was good, but the croutons weren't great and there was too much dressing. Also, the house salad was swimming in dressing; I couldn't even eat it. There is only one vegetarian soup option and, fortunately, I liked it.  The ambiance is fun and casual so it's a nice place to meet friends, but I wouldn't go there again for a meal. It's a nice place for happy hour drinks and appetizers.",

A pizookie (pizza cookie) is a MUST when you come to this restaurant.    It's so fresh, and the combination of warm cookie and cold ice cream, is a match made in heaven! I love getting half chocolate chip and half oreo flavor! However, if you're not feeling too indulgent on sweets, you can always order a mini pizookie!   Their drinks are pretty decent priced as well! I ordered their strawberry mojito, and it was I was tempted to order more!   The only reason I didnt give a five star review, is because sometimes the service is a hit or miss when I go. Some days I get excellent service, other days I get really slow service & long wait times to take your order (even when it's not a busy night). But all in all, a great restaurant to check out!",

From placing my order online to picking up my food, the experience was quick and seamless.  The food was your typical pub type food albeit with a bit more variety and a host of healthy options and is good for a quick bite or for a family meal.  This location is in the middle of a strip mall amongst other businesses so parking is plentiful but you may have to walk bit as this location seems quite popular.",

Burgers, steaks (including prime rib), sandwiches, pasta, ribs, chicken, salmon . . . the list goes on. It's almost like a miniature version of Cheesecake Factory.  What distinguishes BJs from the rest, is the flexibility of the kitchen. Maybe you want a mini pizza but aren't in the mood for deep dish. No problem! Ask the server to sub for flat bread. Hamburger buns got you down? Order that patty on toasted sourdough or lettuce wrapped. If you can find the ingredient somewhere on the menu, odds are the kitchen can build it for you.  BJs won't blow your socks off, but the food and service are consistent, reliable, and satisfying. On the rare occasion my order isn't right, they fix it right away.",

We got two huge salads that I can't remember the names of & we couldn't even finish  them But were completely delicious.  While eating lunch I remembered I was looking for a location to have my birthday dinner. For a large group. I asked woody if I was able to bring a cake in from a local bakery (Freed's) because that was a deal breaker considering we already ordered it. He went out of his way to get the manager and even bringing me the brochures. Great guy.  By the way they said yes we could bring the cake from Freed's or Freed's could deliver it (awesome) and we will be booking our party with them ... to be continued",

Food is always better fresh so I decided to stop in today. There was a party by us - that had already finished eating by the way, but they also had a different server. My boyfriend and I took about 10-15 minutes deciding what to eat and we had at least 5 servers walk by (including the one who ended up being ours.) Our host came by and asked if we had been helped, and we said no. Our server finally came by and wanted to take just drink orders after 20 minutes? I said no, we're ready to order.. hello lady my menu is hanging off the side of the table. Anyways, I got my salad before my drinks! The manager dropped my salad off and didn't say a word. Not thirsty or anything! Then our food came but was run by someone else (signs this server SUCKED if she can't run any of her food), and no ranch. Can't have fries without ranch, and our server didn't come by for at least 10 more minutes to check on us when she didn't even run our food. I like this place, but not this location. I work in the industry and I just wish I could do the job for these people, it's pathetic. I wish the Centennial location wasn't so far - seems like people actually care about service, timing, and their tips!",

    "text": "Yo.  I'm going to go against my own lame criteria and review a restaurant that is a huge chain.  This place is pretty damn good.  I've been there about 5 times and each one has been met with very nice staff, solid food, and great service.    Try the steaks.  I  get the New York strip usually and it's always cooked perfect (order medium usually).  HUGE PORTIONS!!  You may enter a booth, eat, then have to sleep over because your stomach has created a seal against the table that you cannot break.    I'm not a big fan of the pizzas as I think they are too doughy.  But pizza is a thing, much like the name of this restaurant, where I've really never had a bad one.  So, you may really enjoy it.    Also get the rootbeer.  You MAY get diabeetus after finishing off a couple of mugs, but it will be worth it.    So yeah, don't eat for a week before going. Let's all get some BJ's!!",

    "text": "I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times, and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas, pastas, tacos, and desserts from their that I've lost count, but I will showcase some of their highlights.   I usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions, so I'm full by those alone, but I've gotten their chicken tenders before, and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard, so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries, not gross ketchup.  Their pizza is great. If there is a long wait, and you have to sit in the waiting area, the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait, but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe.   I usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni, stringy cheese, and hearty tomato sauce. Normally, I hate tomato sauce on pizza, seriously, the less sauce the better, but with BJ's pizza, their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better, but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go, I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm...  The sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon, cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great, but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy, and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink.  So... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off, get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously, you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it, and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert.   So yeah... this was a really long review, but I've been here so many times, and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon.",

I really like how they suggest certain foods with the different beers they offer.  The pizza's are great.  I have never been to Chicago, but it's nice to be able to get a deep dish only a few miles from where I live.  The pizza's may not look gigantic but don't let that fool you they are feeling.  The staff are awesome the place is always clean and there is always A nice buzz in the place.  There hasn't been a single time that when someone suggests Bj's I say no.  The place is great.",

    "text": "SCRUMPTIOUS THICK PIZZAS!  I absolutely love BJ's so after a doctors visit we had were hungry & unanimously chose this spot since it was also on the way home. We ordered take out & decided on 2 LARGE pizzas... when we arrived to pick up we noticed on the board that there was a family style package meal that includes 2 Large pizzas, salad, wings, & 2 sides for around $5 more than what we were already paying for the 2 pizzas we ordered & when we tried to mention it to Brianna when paying out she was just super rude about it & also had no idea about this special. \" o... I guess you can....\" in a rude tone of manner i would have to say as we pointed out what their special entails. We also had to witness her being a bit toney w/ another person that was trying to apply to the place... =/  that's my reason for the 3 star...   The food was great though even if it was take-out... by the time we got home it was still hot & delicious. But one thing that really SUCKED was that we had asked for extra ranch on the side for the pizza & when we got home, all we see is the one ranch that came w/ the wings =[  MASHED POTATO - very smooth & rich creamy flavor... I love it when such a simple dish is made perfect.   FRIES - crisp skinny fries Can't complain they're fries.  BUFFALO WINGS - the sauce was on the side & it came w/ a good amount of celery sticks.  2 LARGE BUFFALO CKN PIZZA - although I usually go w/ the GREAT WHITE, the Buffalo chicken pizza here is delicious... not too overwhelming & perfect texture to the crust as ALWAYS & the right amount of protein & veggie ratio for each bite!   SANTA FE CHICKEN SALAD - refreshing salad w/ some crisp to it w/ the tortilla strips & the Santa Fe dressing was awesome.  Hope to be back to try the dine in experience since I usually go to the one on eastern. Hopefully it will be a bit more friendly when dining there.",

When I was a wedding planner, one of my brides wanted to have their rehearsal dinner here and they fit roughly 25+ people in the back room. It was pretty tight and rather than being sectioned off, it was one long table. It wasn't very comfy but it was good enough for what was needed. Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't, they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can.  BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family. It's low lighting may put you to sleep (as it does for me sometimes) but it assists when you're trying to have a little more intimate/private mean/drink as it makes it harder to see those around you lol.",

You're even allowed to add up to 8-9 toppings to a happy hour personal pizza ($6-ish) or pick a specialty pizza to represent your pick. What a deal!  Super attentive service. Makes you want to invest in a franchise, but all of these are corporate-owned, just like Panda Express is. That must the secret to consistency and stellar, no-excuses service! Our drinks (iced tea, beer and more beer) were never down to a 1/3rd of a glass. :)  It's no wonder this is many people's \"favorite restaurant\" when asked to state one. I certainly wouldn't want to be the Olive Garden next door (which does well, too) or any other establishment sharing the same parking lot.  If you haven't tried BJ's in a long time, go. Certainly go instead of to Grimaldi's or to the Cheesecake Factory or even to Dom DeMarco's pizzeria for that matter. It's just so spot on it's hard not to compare. Everything that comes out of their kitchen is super solid, and they won't hesitate to make things right if they're not!",

It's not too fancy but nice for a not too pricy dinner as well.   We got seated and ordered our drinks. The first 2, maybe 3 pages were nothing but beers or wines. When the food came it was literally so hard to decide. Such a big menu and so many things that sound really good. I couldn't decide for a while. I got the sirloin steak, an appetizer (fries), and my steak sides were mashed potatoes and clam chowder. The fries were really good, the steak was smaller than the portioning of mashed potatoes (I'm actually being serious I've seen a french fry that was better than the steak), the chowder was hands down the best. Service was amazing and I'm honestly very impressed from this place. Even though the steak was very small, I still got realy full to where I couldn't finish it.",

Long story short, I decided not to wait any longer.The manager came by and took the meal off my bill, big deal! Obviously that was going to happen I didn't get any food.Im surprised that there wasn't a free desert offered, maybe a percentage off my bill, take my appetizer off, but there was nothing. I just think when something like this happens where a customer leaves without eating, it's a bigger issue.",

    "text": "Came to this Bjs twice today. In fact, I come here every time I'm in town, which is several times a year. Everything about our dinner experience tonight sucked. I could go on and on, but in a nutshell we paid for drinks we didn't drink and food we didn't eat cuz it was so bad. Service was questionable. Management was abrasive. Food came out wrong. Cocktails were so poorly made we couldn't drink them, even though we were there to celebrate a birthday. Our server was not a redeeming quality, by any means, for the lack of quality tonight. Wouldn't be back if tonight was a deciding factor, which I suppose it could be at some point. HOWEVER, lunch today was amazing!! One of the best dining experiences I've had at a Bjs in a very long time!  It was busy from the start. They started getting busy when the doors opened, my son and I were part of that early lunch herd. Our server was absolutely fantastic! The food was great! Management was present and extremely pleasant. Turns out, the sever Krystle that made us feel so welcomed and appreciated was actually the bartender. She was picking up tables to help the team out because the servers on the floor got so busy so fast. Being a server and a bartender myself, and being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I know how difficult busy lunch shifts can be. Kuddos to Krystle and the entire day crew today for really knocking it out of the park! Such a great experience! Thank you!  Would give 10 stars if I could based on my first trip today!!! Thank you Krystle!!!!. Would give 2 stars on my dinner trip, which literally left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth.  If you're staying at red rock, walk over for lunch! So great!! With Vegas being a dining mecca, you may want to consider going elsewhere for decent dinner & drinks",

Cheddar broccoli soup was horrible. Clam chowder was okay. Ribs were not good. Caesar salad was actually a \"house\" salad. Disappointed. Ordered three (easy) desserts (celebrating birthday). Took 30 minutes. If it was not one of the children's birthdays, we would have left. We will not be returning.",

Our server wasn't attentive to us or any of his tables. I started to notice he would just disappear and not check on his section as often as the other servers would check on their tables. It was worse when we ran out of water at our table and it took 5 minutes for him to approach our table and another 10 for him to loop back around to us to refill our waters. This wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't watched him grab the water container, walk past us refill waters for another table and then just disappear again. I'm disappointed with the service, I haven't had an experience like this in a while and I sure hope BJ's can step up service.",

After they switched the channel, a couple of folks, that happen to be white, that barely arrived, complained about the soccer game and wanted to see baseball. The staff immediately changed the channel to the baseball.   Honestly this is beneath me and BJ's, it's the the fact that it happen. The server should have kindly told the couple that there was a request before them, and should have given them alternative accommodations.",

However, sitting your customers in a table where it hasn't been PROPERLY cleaned is another thing.  We've asked numerous employees for assistance, but our request was passed on from one to another.   Another issue was upon food delivery, there was no utensils? How are we suppose to eat? Hmm.. also, food order was wrong.  Now, I understand that it gets very hectic and all on some occasions. But this is no way to cater paying customers.   Everything was slow, barely any water refills? But when it came to giving out the bill it was hella quick? Cmon now..   Improvements have to be made.

    "text": "I am typically not a fan of chain restaurants, but my wife and I went to BJ's to try their famed pizookie.  A pizookie is advertised as a pizza-cookie, a cookie baked in a deep dish and served with ice cream on top.    We initially ordered a pizookie trio, which includes three mini pizookies for about $11.  However, our awesome server, Frances (Frankie), informed us they were running a pizookie special.  A regular sized pizookie typically costs around $7, but with the special, pizookies were only $3.  So, Frankie pointed out that we could get three regular sized pizookies for $9 instead of three mini pizzookies for $11.  We appreciated Frankie's suggestion and heeded her advice.  Thus, we ordered three regular sized pizookies: (1) peanut butter with chocolate ice cream; (2) brownie with vanilla ice cream; and (3) white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream.    Frankie recommended we have chocolate ice cream with the peanut butter pizookie because the combination of flavors is similar to a Reese's Pieces.  I agree with her assessment, but was disappointed in the pizookie.  The peanut butter pizookie was overcooked, which made the cookie hard and the burnt edges overpower any peanut butter flavor.  The chocolate ice cream was also lacking in flavor.    The brownie pizookie was decent.  It was soft, gooey, and chocolatey.  In addition to the ice cream, it came with whip cream and a cherry.    The white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie was our favorite.  The pizookie was crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  We could taste the white chocolate and the macadamia nut.  The ice cream on this pizookie was also the only ice cream that did not melt, which made the dish more enjoyable.  Overall, a pizookie is a fun dish and is a great deal at the special price of $3.  However, the \"deep dish\" is not deep.  Rather, it is about one quarter of an inch.  So, whereas I was expecting a thick cookie, I felt it was too thin to enjoy as a solo dessert.  I would not pay the full price for a pizookie.    On the positive end, Frankie is one the best servers I have had in a long time.  She is helpful, upbeat, friendly, and super sweet.  While she was serving us, she was also serving a table next to us, which included a few difficult guests.  Frankie impressed me because she maintained her composure and demeanor throughout the meal.  I also really like the BJ's App.  By signing up for the rewards program, you qualify for a free pizookie without any other requirements.  The App's interface is extremely user friendly and allows you to place some orders and pay your bill, which a huge advantage at a busy chain restaurant.    ALL-STAR PERSON: Frances (Frankie). ALL-STAR DEAL: $3 Pizookie (special price). ALL-STAR FEATURE: BJ's App.",

Don't get me wrong service was great and atmosphere too but the food was ok, and it's nothing special. For my taste I like to go somewhere where foods are unique and divergent. A restaurant/ sports bar that offers burgers, pizzas, salads etc is nothing special. I don't know I guess it's me. Let's talk about what I had: So for my visit I had calamari and sparkling sangria. Calamari was too salty for my taste but sangria was great. Will I come again, not so, maybe... but only if I would be dragged in here and forced to stay- you better be paying my order.  :D  Restaurant clean, great service and parking is ok.",

Lots of beer to choose from, they have the types of beer on a large display on the back wall where you can see from your table. Service was great, food was great. We ordered fries.. Brewhouse classic pizza.. Best beginnings appetizer combo (artichoke dip, spring rolls and mozzarella sticks). This was A LOT of food for two people. I was just craving some fries.

My husband got a full rack of ribs, I got the Asian salad and my daughter had a grilled cheese with fries. We all really enjoyed our food. My husband hardly wanted to share his ribs but we made it work lol. After that we ordered pazookie's. They were delicious as always!!! Thank you Kim, we will be back!!",

The second time I came with a large party and we were seated right away. The service was great we received everything very fast and everything came out hot and tasty. We even had joiners and their food was rushed out which I thought was very kind! Everyone loved their orders I absolutely love the tomato mozzarella salad,the wedge salad,the fish and chips,shrimp scampi and the jambalaya was amazing! I was surprised to see they had so many healthy options and zucchini noodles with any dish for a $2 upcharge. I drank the unsweetened peach tea,and my friends all ordered cocktails. I heard their happy hour is amazing. I would recommend to anyone in the area to eat here and try all the great meals they have. We even got a giant pazookie at the end and it was Devine!",

The waitress we had only had 2 other tables. She was pretty short in the beginning nothing ridiculous though. After we ordered it took FOREVER to get our food. All we ordered was an appetizer. After our stuff came it was, cold, the quality of the food was disgusting, and wrong. They had to fix it and that took a while too. When our fixed order came out she dropped it off and walked away without asking if we needed anything else. Our waitress NEVER came back to ask if we needed anything else after that. We had no water, the chance to get more sauce, absolutely nothing. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the manager comped the disgusting appetizer.",

We ordered the deep dish pizza, half bbq chicken and half white(alfredo), yeah that's right you can get half and half! It was good, although it seemed like is was just reheated to order and not freshly cooked because it wasn't really hot and you could tell that the halfs had not been cooked together, that was a little disappointing but it still had a good flavor. The cilantro on the bbq chicken was a winner for me, I wasn't that into the white side honestly. The Pazookie's though, holy hot cookie with ice cream on top! We ordered the sampler so we could try 3 different flavors and it was heavenly! If you love beer, go here! But be willing to spend some dough!",

We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us. We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready.  They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?",

    "text": "BJ's is, and has been for over seven years, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas; and I have been to A LOT of restaurants all over town. To me, a great restaurant is one that has an enjoyable environment, great food, good service, and fair prices. BJ's definitely has all of these qualities.   To begin, the environment is very welcoming and well-kept. The restaurant has a big city, Chicago style, feel to it and offers both bar/lounge area seating with a full bar and several flat screen TV's all around the restaurant. The dining room offers booth seating for two, four, or up to eight and tables for a small party of a couple friends or a huge party of a high school archery team, (I tried going with something other than football team, you get the point...). The lights are slightly dim to keep the mood somewhat mellow, but the TV's and music keep the restaurant upbeat--it's a good balance for a good environment.   The food at BJ's is awesome! They offer a great selection of appetizers which are perfect to share, as well as smaller sized appetizers, \"Tiny Bites,\" which make perfect individual appetizers or sides. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza, (appetizer to share), and the gourmet mac & cheese, (individual \"tiny bite\"). As far as the main entrees, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods ranging from classic burgers to Italian inspired pastas to Teriyaki Chicken to Grilled Salmon and even some Jambalaya. BJ's also has some delectable gourmet salads and wholesome soups. My favorite entree has to be the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.  There is a large selection of drinks offered at BJ's, from the full bar to specialty drinks, both alcoholic and non, as well as their signature hand-crafted root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry soda.    Now for the good part--the desserts. BJ's is known for their pizookies. Pizookies are cookies, baked in a pizza pan, served hot out of the oven with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have the classic Chocolate Chip pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top as well as quite a few other flavors such as Triple Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and, newly added, Red Velvet. There's also an Oatmeal Raisin pizookie for those of you who like to feel like you're eating healthy even while having dessert. BJ's also offers beignets and an ice cream sundae as well as a couple other dessert items.   Almost every time I have been to BJ's, the staff has been very friendly. Only a couple times have I ever had an issue with a server or host. If my order is ever made incorrectly, which rarely happens, the server will gladly take it back and bring me the correct order as well as give me some sort of compensation, such as a discount or free dessert.  The prices are really good for a restaurant such as this one. They have lunch specials during the week which are only about 6-8 dollars. As far as the prices on the regular menu, most of the items range anywhere from 10 to 18 dollars with a few exceptions being slightly  higher or lower.   In all, BJ's is a great place to have a quick lunch, to go on a date, or to take the family out for dinner. It is very unlikely that you will be disappointed with this restaurant, (unless, of course, you are a complete restaurant snob who will complain about the most insignificant things), and I do hope that you give BJ's a visit in the near future.",

The hostess are almost never nice but I guess it's so busy that they just don't care. Asked about there happy hour and the sever told me that she didn't know. She didnt even try to find out... Awesome.... They have two different type of fries and they almost always bring my bf the wrong one and he usually doesn't say anything but the last time it happened I politely said they were the wrong ones and the food runner jut picked up the plate without saying anything and walked away. Very awkward. So I usually just try to order to go now since it's usually not a pleasant experience. Maybe it's too busy and the staff is just overworked? Not sure and don't really car.",

The service was friendly and fast.

Anyhow my sis and I were staying at Red Rock and wanted something other than a buffet/fastfood/$$$restaurant so we decided to come here. The food is pretty much the same across the board which is great because I hate inconsistency when it comes to chain restaurants. This restaurant has PHENOMENAL service. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and our server [whose name I'm unsure of] was AMAZING. She was attentive, sweet, and just a great server. We ended up getting a pitcher of beer, artichoke dip/bruschetta, nachos, and a parmesan crusted chicken entree all for under $60!   Note: On the check it said our server was Cinnamon. Not sure if that's a birth-given name or a nickname... Cinnamon was the shit!",

Since we're usually starving by the time we meet up, appetizers are a big deal.  Because there's a BBQ thing going on, we tried the corn fritters with a special aioli (light textured fritters, with just enough corn...not so much that it makes it too dense and chewy).  The calamari was flash fried and tender, with a barely-there seasoned batter.  At first, the chicken lettuce wraps didn't look like it would be enough to share, but we all had at least two wraps each, doused with the hot mustard for some bite.  Good experience, so glad it's in our neighborhood.  Tip:  Send someone in to sign up for a table while you find parking; get a head start.",

A part of me wishes their menu was smaller, because I never know what to get! I feel like I am always missing out on something! But, no matter what I have ordered I have never been let down. Their Avocado egg rolls are so good I can barely stand it! I am not a beer drinker, but I order beer here cause it's so delicious. Their seasonal pumpkin beer is amazing. My boyfriend raves about the pazookie dessert, but we are always too full by the time we are done I just can't do it. I told him one of these days we will just come in for beers and dessert and skip the meal, ha!   Give the place a go if you haven't yet. I doubt you would be disappointed, unless you are looking to woo your date with some romantic meal, then go somewhere else. No, it doesn't have ambiance as I saw one person complain about... but this is not that kind of restaurant. It's a busy loud restaurant with sports on the TV's, what do you expect? Go to a classy joint for a romantic night, this is a low to moderately priced brewery people! And a wonderful place to grab a bite of great food and a good beer!",

I don't know when this happened  but they now offer a pizookie trio. This was perfect when the three of us couldn't decide on flavor!  We got three individual smaller versions for $9!

The one that hubby ate was also incredible, but not the reason why... his ribs were terrible.  The potato was enormous, ridiculously so.. and his \"smoked\" ribs weren't smoked, they were boiled then some sauce was slapped on and they were finished on a grill.  It was obvious, and their menu was a lie.  Will I return?  Possibly... but not for the ribs.  They get a bonus point for removing it from the tab, but they lost a point for him having to resort to eating half of my meal because no server came around to find out how the food was, thus giving him a chance to order something else.",

Seriously, excellent server.  **** Kids: The menu is great, with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99, which includes a main dish, side dish, and a drink.  The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside.  * Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed, which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and, while the flavor was okay, the pasta was terrible.  At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2,3,4 and more! Obviously, this makes for some crunchy, impossible-to-eat pasta.  How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate.  Conclusion: Unless you are just looking for a place to get a drink and watch a game, go elsewhere.  There are probably 20 other restaurants within a 2-minute walk of this place, most of which will be a better food experience.",

I pulled up my handy-dandy Yelp app on my phone and found BJ's.  After a few wise cracks about how with a name like BJ's, it has to be good, and then proceeded to navigate our immature selves there.  We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly.  We ordered a couple of beers and the potstickers for an app, and decided to keep it simple with a cheese and tomato deep dish pizza.  Both the beer and food we had were quite tasty.  Back home, the only option we have for Chicago deep dish style pizza is Uno's, and this definitely beat that by a landslide.  It made us want to go to Chicago someday so we can try the real deal for a basis of comparison!  Overall, it was a nice, inexpensive, quick, and tasty alternative to dining on The Strip!",

    "text": "So we go here with my parents a lot. The pizza is pretty good and the atmosphere is generally pretty good. TVs everywhere so you can watch a game and still focus on the people in your group. Their beer is pretty good and very reasonably priced and there is almost always some sort of special going on. My only complaint is that the Vegas locations don't have nutritional guides on hand. They are readily available in California so why not Nevada?",

Imagine my excitement when I found out they have a few here(And in Cali)! I've taken a few friends here and it's been a pleasant experience each time. Good food, drinks and service. Big fan of their deep dish pizzas. They do have hand tossed as a pizza option now. Prices are about average for this type of venue, not real pricey but not cheap. It is also a brewery, so they make their own brews, even root beer and cream sodas. They do currently have some specials. 2 for $19.95 meal which includes 2 salad or soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Also some lunch specials starting at $6. They do have other items like sandwiches and entrees but honestly, I've never gotten past their pizzas yet hehe. If you have a craving for some good brews n pizzas, definitely not a bad place to stop by!",

    "text": "I really love my NY style pizza...thin, crispy crust...not too much toppings to weigh it down.  But man, BJ's Chicago style pizza gives it a run for its money!  I enjoy the pizza here and apparently a lot of other folks do too.  This place is always packed for dinner!  Very happening.    Went here with the fam, and we had a blast.  It was great hearing the game on the TV, people congregating and laughing, plates and glasses clinking.  The atmosphere is pretty inviting, lots of dark woods and high ceilings almost reminding you of a gastropub.  BJ's has a very large menu that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, Angus burgers, sliders, giant stuffed potatoes, pasta, and even a gluten-free menu (no gluten, in a pizza joint?  Come on!  It's pizza!)...but the Chicago pizza is the star.  I pretty much perused the main menu and went straight for the heart, BJ's wonderful deep dish pizzas.  They usually have at least 8-9 different pies on the menu and of course you can make your own with any of their ingredients.  Every pizza comes with their special blend of FIVE cheeses.  Their pizza creations include - BJ's Favorite Pizza (The Works w/ meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes), Mediterranean (Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta), Sweet Pig (Pineapple, tomatoes, and roasted ham), BBQ Chicken (BBQ chicken, red onions, tomatoes, hickory BBQ sauce, and cilantro), and the Southwestern (Blackened chicken, green chiles, chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and cilantro) just to name a few.  They even have calzones, and yes...a gluten-free thin crust pizza!  I feel so sorry for you people that can't handle gluten.  No deep dish for you!  We ended up with a large BJ's Favorite pizza for all of us to share.  Just to let you know they aren't cheap, probably around $10-24 each depending on the size and type of pie you get (Mini, Small, Medium, or Large).  Mind you, these pizzas don't look large when they get to the table but they are DEEP.  It's like a good almost two inches thick!  I thought our family of four could finish the entire pie in one sitting but I was wrong!  Our pie had six large slices and we could only eat a slice each!  You definitely have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork...no folding slices in half folks!  The crust is buttery, not too heavy, and completely cooked through without being soggy.  The ingredients were fresh, and the veggies still had a light bite to them.  The sauce was tangy and sweet.  Overall a very delicious slice of pie!  Yes, like pie!  Very good pizza.  We rounded out our dinner with a few appetizers, the Crispy Calamari ($8.95) with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli, and the Garden Medley Salad ($8.95) with romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Both very tasty.  Although we were stuffed (ha ha...like pie?) our server told us we had to try BJ's Famous Pizookie ($5.95).  After rants from the kids on how we never have dessert it ended up being ordered.  Funny how they win and you don't even realize it.  This thing ended up being delicious!  Like sweet crack!  Not that I've tried crack before.  The Pizookie is a hot out of the oven, fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and served in it's own mini deep dish tin.  We got a chocolate chunk cookie, but you can also choose, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal raisin walnut.  So good!  They bake the cookie dough until it's just a smidge underdone so your cookie is still gooey on the inside.  Goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top!  Good way to go to end a calorie busting meal!    I wanted to try one of their hand crafted micro brews but I couldn't fit it in on this trip.  I hear they also have a great happy hour M-F from 3 PM-7 PM and also on Sun-Th from 10 PM-close.  They have $1 their draft beers and cocktails, $2 off most of their appetizers, and 1/2 off all their Mini Pizzas.  I will have to go check this out on maybe a game day!    I definitely want to go back here again soon, good food, good service, good times.  Go here, and enjoy yourself before the crazy holidays!  BJ's has made me a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza.  NY pizza I love you so...Chicago deep dish, you can be my secret mistress!  SHHHHHH!!!",

I can understand to an extent if it is very busy as it usually is, but I raise my hand for all those minutes and even if my server is not around there are multiple others that can clearly see me looking for some help that do not come.",

It's a great place to bring a group if you're treating cuz you'll be saving money. Large entrees that are shareable are probably the deep dish pizzas (yum) and their pastas. I also think their lunch special runs from 11am - 3pm. It is also really nice to just come here and sit at the bar with a beer and watch some games on their tvs.   Service: I'm really surprised at all the negative comments about service. I went during lunch this past Friday and my server was more than beyond courteous and very attentive. He came back to check on us 2-3 times and also made sure to let us know that the food was on its way. I guess you just have to get lucky?",

She helped me find a good brew of choice, and she also made light conversations with us. Such a sweet waitress. Also, I left forgetting my keys on the table and the nice busser flagged me down and gave me my keys back. Thank you sir!  The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95, I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different. I honestly come for the pazookie. They have the best pazookies, and they bake the cookie the way I lllloooovvveee my cookie! Soft and doughy. My ultimate favorite is the macadamia nut pazookie. I'm really tempted to try the red velvet, but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated).  I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet.  If you are all about a strong roundhouse kick in your brew...try the Piranha...I was about to choose this one then Destiny kind of warned me that it's got a really strong spicy taste to it, and it's got a whole lot of hop to it. So, I backed out on that one. But if you are one who is all about the IPA intensity..go for the Piranha.",

Egg-rolls arrived and they tasted weird. Couldn't figure out what was wrong with them. When the entree arrived, it looked as if it had been dropped on the floor and then re-plated. I pointed out to the server that it looked like a disaster and her response was \"Yes, they do throw allot of stuff in there\". I took a few bites and it just tasted horrible. Sent it back and within a hour I was sick beyond belief. Not sure if it was the egg-rolls or the salmon but I'll never eat here again. They should have better controls to check the food quality before serving it. It only takes one time to lose a customer, especially when you get food poisioning.   However, the server was very friendly. After I sent the food back she came and told me that it didn't look right (wondering why they didn't see this when they served it to me).  If I ever decide I need a full body cleanse I'll make sure to dine here again.",

Both the waitress (Toni) and management staff (especially David)  acted totally unprofessionally. Additionally, I've been here on several occasions and wait for way too long every time to get seated and receive food. The service is NEVER good, which isn't surprising considering how I'll-suited their manager is to MANAGE. As a business student, I am well aware of how a manager should treat patrons, and this is not it. My family and I have lived here for over 15 years and have frequented this place since I was in elementary school. I vow to NEVER go back. Seriously, take my word for it. Plus the food is subpar at very, very best. It really was just close to our house, that's the ONLY reason. And now I have no reason to ever come back. I have called the corporate office and am waiting for a response. They must know how horrible this experience was.",

There may be a bit of hyperbole there, but damn, I'd be hard-pressed to say that ive ever tried a better pizza and thats saying something since this is a chain.  I've been frequenting both the San Jose, Roseville and Las Vegas locations (yeah, i get around) for almost four years and finally have the sense of mind to review it.  Whats nice about this place is that no matter which location you go to, you can always expect consistency.  Great ambiance, great food and great fun are to be had at each location and you can really tell the company strives for it. Where to start, oh yeah, PIZZA!  The pizza is amazing.  It is the deep dish style not to be confused with the stuffed type youd get at Zacharys in the yay area or Giordano's in the Chi.  The pizza is baked to perfection, has the right bit of crunch to it and is just generally good all over.  The sandwiches, beer and desserts are nothing to scoff at either.  Please try a Pizookie if you ever get the opportunity.  I'd rank it right up there with the White Molten Chocolate Cake (believe it or not) at Chili's or the Brownie Sundae at MRKT inside the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas.  Do yourself a favor, eat at BJ's.",

    "text": "The highlight: Wine half off  on Tuesdays.  That's a deal. It goes for both bottles and by the glass.  I believe the special applies all day long and not only during happy hour (3-7pm).  They have the basics:  their \"house wine\" is barefoot (listed at $19/bottle) but with the special it comes out to be very similar to what you can get it for at Trader Joe's.     I shared the homemade Kettle Style Potato chips ($3): good choice. I also shared the flatbread Margherita Fresca pizza which I don't strongly recommend;  It was $9 and barely any tomatoes.  Mainly just cheese with specs of tomatoes.   I just ate here earlier today and had a great time.  There's a good overall ambiance with the music, the service, and the continuous crowd coming in and out (It's a tuesday evening and it was still crowded by 10PM).   I probably would come back because of it's convenient location, minimal wait and decent prices.",

But when you are there you must get the pizookie, it's a gift from above. Deep dish cookie with cool sweet ice cream on top is a great dessert for any time of the year. And to drink they brew their own root beer and cream sodas, also as you may guess it is off the wall good. In my book BJ's is a necessity.",

So I think most of the food is pre made and frozen! The last experience for me wasn't the best. The waiter told me that my flat bread that I ordered wouldn't have bacon on it (the description of the item on the menu did not mention bacon) however as soon as he puts the food down on the table it is almost completely covered in bacon! So I asked him what it was and he apologized and then just took the food bank. Maybe he was nervous for making a mistake but he didn't even ask if I'd like something else instead. So I sat there foodless and unhappy! The hostess walked by and I mentioned this to her and then the manager appeared at our table trying to correct the situation. I did appreciate his efforts. But I didn't eat anything. I was over eating.",

The food was very good, we had the fish and chips, bacon guacamole burger, chicken dinner and a half and half pizza.

Typically when me & the hubster are in Vegas we're visiting family so we tend to stay away from the Strip and just relax... which is sometime hard in Vegas. BJ's is so chill it's easy to feel comfortable. Though its a chain restaurant, they've hit the nail on the head with stellar service and strong drinks.    Lots of beer choices and like Ken. M said, they're one seasonal beer on tap is a killer hit (at least with my hubby!) I had one of the strongest cosmos Id gotten in a long time and that was perfectly fine with me considering we were there with the in-laws ;)  Nonetheless, when you're in Vegas and either want a break from the Strip or just someplace to feel comfortable, watch the game and put a few back, BJ's should be just perfect!",

BJ's offers healthy size portions (often enough to keep me in left overs for a day or two at our family condo.) I highly recommend any of the specialty salads or the stuffed baked potatoes, which are a meal in themselves.  If you are up for some beer - the 7 beer sampler fits the bill to start. I would recommend the Tatonka Stout if you like dark beer. BJ's also offers some hard ciders and regular mixed drinks.  Watch for BJ's happy hour - most mini pizzas and appetizers are 1/2 price later in the evening in the bar.   BJ's is great for kids and offers several kid's selections (that are adult size meals.) Most come with an included drink - my son always gets the handcrafted root beer, which is a lot better than the other soft drinks.  Grab a bit at BJ's - you won't be disappointed. They have a great take out too if you want to avoid the line.",

We always love what we get, so its hard to try new things.  If you have room for desert (servings are VERY generous) then you gotta try the Pizookie.  Huge cookie with ice cream.

    "text": "I recently moved to the area and while getting unpacked and settled, I grabbed take out from here about twice/week. I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e, Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places.   There have a been a few issues - one time, despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time, my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time, a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times, however, the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order, the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked, it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day, they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant, so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts), but the take-out order staff is super friendly, accomodating, and easy to deal with.   The food is pretty good. It's not fancy, gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e, Applebee's, Chili's).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent, and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips, but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well. (But am still looking!)   I'd definitely recommend this place and think it has 5-star potential (but need to eat in to find out).",

I enjoy a good beer, and whether it's a BJ's house brew or a guest tap, I always find something hoppy and malty to drink. I usually patronize the bar area, which is my go-to at most establishments, and this one is non-smoking so it's always a good choice. Servers and bartenders are always great and if you can make it to a beer dinner I highly recommend it.  Besides beer, I generally order stuffed mushrooms, potato wedges (not fries), salad (they have several that I like) or pizza. On a rare occasion I have a pizzookie. It's an awesome dessert, I just don't do sweet very often.   The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip, among other things, and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great. It's pan pizza, like pizza hut style only really good. Not to be confused with deep dish, it's just a nice thick buttery crust and just slightly doughy. Health food it is not.",

I always take the longest time to order here because they have such a great variety to choose from. Some dishes I've tried here is the Chicken Alfredo, the country fried chicken burger, and the ribeye. They are known for their \"pizookies\" which is their dessert. It's a warm, freshly baked cookie that is topped with icecream. Recently I came in and tried their Churro pizookie which is just a bunch of mini churros with a scoop of vanilla bean icecream on it but it was so good because the churros are fresh and warm (It's only offered for a limited time too)!!! Anyways, this place is a great place to go to if you are in a group and you don't really know what you are in the mood for.",

I always add shrimp and although they're not generous with the shrimp it's an adequate serving. The vegetables in the salad are always fresh. I also like the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer.

    "text": "I I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out!  I'm glad he showed me the light!  The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is True in this case!  They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS!  And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy.  The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4 stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like this past weekend, it was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.  The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait.  We asked him about the food situation and he tried to make a joke and then blew us off.    I would say 80% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!",

I generally don't go to places like BJ's because everything is so full of fat, lard, fried you-name-it and portions are always large. I realize I am not their target demo here, but still was happy to come here for lunch to splurge a bit.  The server gets a Star for the various things I threw at him: Changing which Fries I wanted after already placing the order; Side of jalapenos; and the biggie---- having my California Burger delivered deconstructed so that I could pick and choose what I wanted.  He went one step further and put the cheese on the bread, and had the bread completely separate from my burger. This was a great way to enjoy the burger. The burger itself seemed a smallish 1/2 LB and very thin. Consequently, not terribly juicy --- but not bad.  The in-house Root Beer was good and refills came without request.  The desserts looked good and others seemed to like them. I did taste the Grilled Salmon which seemed pretty healthy and tasted fine but nothing too exciting. Steak Fries are well-seasoned and a nice change of pace. I glanced at their 'Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza'. Optimistic thinking, I'd say.   Very friendly staff.",

Lots of TVs with sports, and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything.  The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is.  Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss. Always impressive in the land of the unified restaurant bill.   It may not have a ton of personality, but if you need lots of either different types of food or a huge selection of beer it'd be hard to go wrong.",

Ordered the grilled burger melt with wedge fries and Kacey had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and my burger was cooked just how I asked.

Before my father passed away, we used to come in at least once per week and would be greeted by three or more staff members before we were even seated. Seldom did we have inadequate service and the food always tasted great. After he retired, the highlight of his day would be to go to lunch and chat it up with his favorite waiters and hosts while enjoying some soup and salad. Your staff was so friendly and courteous to him, and I thank you for that.    I recently went back with my brother to catch up and, despite many new staff members, it was still an incredibly friendly environment with great service and delicious food. This BJs has a customer for life.",

    "text": "This has been one of the worst experiences ever here. It started with the hostess. She did not even greet us when we came in, and when she finally did acknowledge our presence she acted like we were annoying her.  After a few minutes she told us it was going to be a few more minutes. After a little time passed she came back and got menus and silverware, and started walk to seat us. She then turned around and told us NO!! Not yet. When she came back she started texting on her phone. A few more minutes went by and she stated asking us some question about if we were loyalty members or not, etc...  Then she didn't say anything for a few minutes. Very awkward silence. Then she told me to go and stand next to the stairs. Usually a host person would tell you it will be a few more minutes, not go stand next to the stairs. Keep in mind that this is 2:30 pm in the. Afternoon when thee are only about 20 people in a restaurant that can easily hold 200, and we are the only people waiting to be seated in a basically empty restaurant.How rude!!! She then walked by me and didn't say anything like I am suppose to be a mind reader and know that I am suppose that I follow her now. I get to the table, and proceeds to throw the menus and silverware on the table and walks away without saying anything.  When our waiter comes, he introduces him self and then proceeds to sit down next to us in the booth, like a long lost friend. Maybe he was really tired. He tells us the specials and gives us a few minutes to decide. When our waiter comes back, he again proceeds to sit down right next to us and take our order. We go ahead and order, and when our food comes 30 minutes later, a different person brings it out to us. They place it on our table and walk away, not a single word comes out of their mouth during this entire process. Not once during our entire meal did the server refill our drinks. If you really enjoy terrible service, this is the place for you. For the rest of us, spend your money else where.",

Prices are reasonable, wide variety on menu, appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees and good wine/beer list. The staff is always friendly, the place is typically busy, we never have to wait more than 15 minutes which is nice. One of my favs is the BBQ chicken chopped salad....the thin french fried onions on too make it so good! Good place for a date, meeting a friend, family dinner or to watch a sports game.",

Food and drinks were bad, service was bad, I was pissed that I paid $100 for this drool. Serious indigestion for ALL of us, including our 4 year old!  Waiter wouldn't bother to take the time to look up my BJ's card, never refilled tea, forgot to order my son's food which left him sitting there watching us eat for 45 minutes! Ordered my daughter's food wrong as well. Overcharged us for meals and drinks. Barely spoke English and obviously couldn't write it either.   With so many more options now since Downtown Summerlin has opened one would think they would at least attempt to make an effort.   I'm very disappointed and it was reflected in the tip or lack thereof. Having been a waitress in the past, there are a few things I expect such as silverware.   I don't know why this place is packed or how it stays open. Perhaps everyone is parking there to eat at Olive Garden next door.",

Brought a friend here that was visiting from out of town because for the people who live in Vegas we don't always want to deal with \"the strip\" just to get some good food! Although we missed the lunch specials that end at 3PM we were still pleased with this dining experience! When we walked in there was maybe about 10 people in there! Not busy at all! Happy hour was still in session and because they offer some really good $5 Mojitos I had to participate hehe! If you choose to do happy hour you must sit in the bar area and some of my personal favorites off the happy hour menu are the avocado rolls and the buffalo wings! We were a bit hungry so we still ordered off the regular menu as well! Calamari was a Very good! The Cherry Glazed salmon was a HIT! I recommend trying that if you are in the mood for fish and or watching calories because it's only 550 calories! Friend ordered the Brewhouse double burger with bacon and loved it! BJ's is known for their pazookie's and I personally like the red velvet one! Will be back soon!",

The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.  I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.  As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised.  Summing up BJ's, it's OK.  It's not a place to which I'd go often.  There are just too many good places to go in this town and this area.",

At 12:30 I called to check on the order and the manager Ron answered and started making excuses that there was confusion with the order and that it was still at the restaurant. He never apologized and there was zero service recovery on his part.  As a Summerlin resident who frequents this location, they have lost a loyal customer when all it would have taken would have been for the manager to give a sincere apology and ask how he could make things right. If you can't offer an effective delivery program you should discontinue it.",

His service wasn't very good either, he seemed to want us to hurry up because we weren't making our ticket big by ordering everything he was recommending, if we do return I hope we're not served by that waiter again !  Like I said the food was good, just they need to pay a little more attention to detail and remember this is Las Vegas, we expect out of this world service !  If management would like to know, we have our receipt !",

I love in Utah, one of the most alcohol repressed states in the country (although getting way better) and I told everyone how good it was who asked me where to go in Las Vegas. They have a new Tatonka Stout. It's good but not as good.  Our server Woody was excellent. Great personality and he really interacted well with us and the customers he waited on.  Today's feast started with the BJ's HopStorm IPA and an appetizer of BJ's Brewhouse blond beer battered asparagus.  The IPA was good with a light hoppy flavor.  The asparagus stalks were too wide and over cooked. I won't order that again. The country fried chicken was very good and the mashed potatoes was the best I have had. I don't know what they did to the potatoes but it worked well with the chicken. Although I was a bit bummed out that they nixed my favorite beer I look forward to coming back for another meal.",

My party consisted of two, we were seated, I ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious and hot upon arrival, however  my food arrived cold and I told my server 3 times that I have allergies (I carry an Epipen).  I ordered the turkey burger with NO Avocado, NO Tomatoes and NO Cranberries and my friend ordered  a different burger.  My order came with EXTRA Cranberries, Cold french fries and my friends burger was cold along with Cold french fries as well, When we flagged down the server,  and told him about our order, he offered to take it back to the kitchen but due to fear and bad experiences with the food being returned we declined and LEFT!   The server didn't offer any type of discount or condolences for our loss of appetite and acted as if his mind was on other things, possibly day dreaming of another job etc.   So a waste of $40 and we ended up going somewhere else for Lunch AGAIN as replacement for the food purchased at BJ's.  THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!     Management needs to take these complaints seriously, if this keeps up this restaurant will have to be shut down for good for lack of business!!",

We all order our food and we're patiently waiting. Honestly probably waiting for 20 plus minutes before a manager came to let us know he ran out of one of the entrees. Fine we'll order something else but why wait to tell us till the last minute while they were already handing out the rest of the food. Then the first cut of my chicken it was raw... so now 2 of us have no food. Everyone was pretty much 2/3 done with the meal before we got our replacements and the manager said we'll take care of it and give you guys some pazookies. Okay cool get the bill and he took off 6$. So the pazookies are on sale for 3$ and you can't bother to comp the entrees?? Our dinning experience took almost 2 hours for all of us to eat and get our food which on a Tuesday night shouldn't of happened. I'm honestly so disappointed on how the manager handled it. I'm never looking for free food but when it's undercooked or delayed due to no one telling us they \"ran out\" I think a free meal is in order.",

My bf and I were greeted as soon as we came in & directed to our party. There were 11 of us at the table and were seated all the way to the right of the restaurant. Since it was happy hour, the bf ordered bone in chicken wings (buffalo something & garlic parm) with fries & I ordered the Alfredo pasta with shrimp instead of chicken. The wings were pretty good, we should've ordered it extra crispy or something. I prefer my wings with more of a crunch. The garlic parm was a little too saucy for me but the bf enjoyed both flavors. The thin cut fries are always a good choice! My pasta was super good! The portion was huge so I could only eat half & saved the other half for lunch the next day. I shared a salted caramel pizookie with a friend and maaaan, it was delicious! I loved the entire meal.   Service was okay. It actually wasn't great. I'm not sure if it was cos we had a large party or what. The guy hardly ever came around to our table. I asked for a refill for my water & never got one. He just didn't seem like he wanted to serve our table, honestly. So deducted one star for service.",

Had to look for the artichokes. Found a couple of leaves. It cost apx. $18.00. What a rip. Chicken and zucchini are cheap.  It was swimming in a tasteless dressing.  Will never order it again.  Might not go there again.",

And rather than welcoming us with an offer to seat us, they stared blankly as if we were to initiate conversation. There was zero dialogue but rather just assumed we would follow as one hostess walked away with menus to seat us. Front line employees set the tone for the entire dining experience and they were so unwelcoming that after sitting I was so uncomfortable that we decided to leave - which I've never done before.",

Whenever we've run into any issues with food, a manager has always came out and talk to us. It's a nice gesture showing acknowledgement that they messed up and the problem is getting fixed. I come here for the food but the customer service is always extra great!",

Hostess at front desk yawning (not even trying to cover her mouth) she seemed very annoyed we were bothering her to ask for a table.  Were sat by another hostess, and upon pulling my chair out, there was food on it.  I had to use my napkin to clean my chair before sitting down, so I asked her for another one.  She brought a clean one but refused to take the dirty one away.   So dirty napkin stayed at the table the whole meal.   Ordered club soda, got 7-up.   Waiter argued that he pushed the correct button on the dispenser.  Finally, begrudgingly, agreed to get me a new drink.   Then the boyfriend had an allergic reaction to his dinner.  He had to rush out and take some Benadryl while I waited to pay.  Waiter argued there wasn't anything in the food to cause a reaction and thought it must have been cross-contaminated.   He did bring the check quickly, so that was nice, but I don't think we'll go back ever again.",

    "text": "The neat thing about hiking is that after burning all those calories, there is the guilty free post-hike meal. After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll, I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ's. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159.    At 11:20 am, the parking lot, which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign.     Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. \"Humm,\" I thought to myself, \"what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?\"      After the waitress handed us our menus, it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeno burger. After a 4.5 mile hike, there was no guilt chowing down this 1,350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us, and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table, the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery, I went for a Pepsi.     The crispy jalapeno burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeno burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges.      BJ's was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience, I will Yelp out that BJ's serves good food but needs improvement in service. If I was alone, I would of walked out and reviewed it 2 stars.",

Cooked and seasoned well and I feel like the amount of chicken given was worth the $3 up- charge. My issue was with the lettuce itself. It was brown, soggy, and very clearly very old. I had a hard time eating it. I mostly concentrated on the chicken and croutons. So that was a big let down. Not sure I'll order that particular dish ever again. But I do enjoy BJ's so I'll be back for the dishes they do do well. The quickness of the delivery was a plus.",

I've ordered take out from BJs before but haven't sat at the bar.  It wasn't crowded.  Tracy immediately came up and offered me a menu and asked about drinks.  I wasn't familiar with any of their beers so I got a few tastes and then decided.  Then I realized they had and did that.  (Thankfully before she poured the big glass... which turned out to be my favorite of the flights)  I ordered guacamole and chips and I swear it hit the bar in front of me in 6 seconds.  Thin, fresh warms chips and great guac.  I nibbled on that.  Explored the massive menu.  Worked on my beer flight and decided i was still hungry.  Ordered fried artichoke.  Again... 60 seconds and piping hot.  Amazing.  It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning.  I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day.    The experience was great.  Tracy was fast, friend, knowledgable.  I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy.  (I even asked questions about the spoon hanging from the tap because I was curious and other kind of dumb things that interested me.)  The whole experience was as good as it gets for just walking in and wanting to nosh and drink.  I love the pizza.  I'm going to have to go back and try something more substantial.  Thanks Tracy!  You made it a very pleasant visit for me. (Manager... give the woman a raise!)",

I spoke with Donna (Manager) and arranged a pizza, pasta, salad buffet for the players and their families.  She emailed me the contract and just like that, we were all set.   When we arrived at BJ's for our dinner, I was surprised to find out that they don't start preparing the food until we get there.  I was a tad bit panicked because the girls had tickets to see the UCLA game, and dinner was already going to be rushed.  Not to worry. We were seated and they already had the salad out! The girls quickly pounced on that. Before they were finished, the pizza and pasta started making their way out. Perfection!  We had plenty of time to spare.  But wait!  Better get the pizookies started, so the girls can have them right after dinner! Where is the server?!? Oh? He got the pizookies started already??? Phew! I've never been to a buffet where things ran so smoothly.  I thought there would be a problem with the check...as there always is with a large group. Nope!  The check was correct to the penny!  We will definitely choose this BJ's again when we are in town!    Thank you Donna, Ron and your staff for making our dinner so seamless. We will definitely be back!",

But in beautiful Summerlin!  Because it was a late lunch, it was not very crowded and I was seated immediately in a plush booth.  What a relief. No crowds and a restful and restorative dining area with the myriad of flat screen TV's kept at just the right volume for conversation when making new friends.  The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still, an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice.  The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato's, black olives, field greens, sweet red onion, hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette.   Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer. Had no idea it was made in-house, but I had three frosty mugs of it plus a to-go glass.  Just a small cat here, so was not able to finish all the food and there was no refrigerator in my suite at The Palazzo. Bygones.  Going back to my second home of Summerlin/Henderson/Las Vegas about seven times a year I always put this BJ's on my food \"bucket-list\". So very Summerlin!  Highly recommended!",

There was choice of broccoli and cheese, clam chowder, tortilla soup and chicken noodle.   Brocoli and cheese is the cheesiest soup i\"ve ever had, hands down. no joke. order it and youll see what i mean. The tortilla soup they do in this weird way but it works. They bring the chicken, and stuff in the soup bowl but with no sauce. they then at your table pour the sauce onto the dish which leaves the torilla chips in it super crunchy. its delicious. also, its a nice touch that they add avocado and a lime inside for a bit of a kick. The caesar salad is okay, nothing special. Its yummy but i ordered only one. Of the soups i ordered then both again.   For our daughter we order chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was actually a great portion. three large golden crispy tenders that came with two dipping sauces. ranch and honey mustard. the honey mustard was delious but the waitress said its bottled. FYI she says the only sauce they make fresh themselves is the vinegarette. The fries were pretty good. They are super thin but it just meant they got cold uber fast. no bueno. My daughter really liked them.  The service was impeccable. Our waitress was named Brittney and she was one of the best waitesses Ive ever had. She made light conversation saying she had a one year old as well. She even asked if while we waited would Leilah like some oranges. She brought a little dish with them in it to keep her occupied while we waited. Awesome. Moms FTW!",

Ratings:  Food: (4) Service (4) Location (5) Ambience/Atmosphere (3)  Overall (4)  I ordered the Mahi-mahi tacos which consisted of two tacos, nachos and a dip.  I really really liked it a lot.  However, it needed a little more of the sauce to put in.  Brad T. ordered his favorite pizza the buffalo chicken.  Lastly, we ordered a white & chocolate pizooke.

Forty-five minutes later we get a voice mail telling us that they aren't delivering tonight.  (That is not what your brochure on you front counter says.)  Ok, we call to find out what the problem was.  The condescending manager then said he will have to talk to his IT department because we shouldn't have been able to do that.  Mr. Manager you may think that people are stupid but you are wrong.  Where is your IT department somewhere in California I am sure.  YOU are the person (or one of your minions) responsible for turning it off on the computer sitting in your office.  YOU screwed up!  Man up and take responsibility!  When you were asked to stop the order and reimburse our card you told us you couldn't do that till tomorrow.  Are you kidding me I can send money across the country in a few seconds.  What are you using Windows 95!  You computer systems must be way out of date.  (Some of us understand how computers work.)  If you don't know how to do something ask one of the high school students that work for you to do it for you.  I'm sure they would love to hack into your system for you.  We then had to come and pick up our order that should have been delivered.  On the phone, we begged you to make it right you throw a couple of things at us. When we got there you where no place to be found.  The food was awful no flavor, poorly made and it was cold.  It had been sitting there since you found out that is was a delivery and you weren't delivering.  Oh yeah, who got the drivers tip?",

The server we request is Keshia very nice to my grandsons, very considerate. She is one of our reasons for going all the way to this BJ''s rather than a closer restaurant or eating in our hotel. Also I didn't get her name but the manager was very accommodating when we made a request! I could definitely tell customer service is a priority at this restaurant.  A lot of places have good food but really good service will make you drive a little farther or wait a little longer, a well placed smile and welcoming service keep you coming back. Keisha makes this a welcoming place for us.",

It's less than a mile from my house which is super awesome and I've never been disappointed!!  Yes, I know this is a chain and I am personally more a fan of the local eateries, but BJ rocks!!  They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad.  Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).   The happy face potatoes are awesome too, but they are not fans.   They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca, but  the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second!  We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness.   Hubby loves their fried shrimp, chicken fried steak and many of their sandwiches.    Breakfast is good too - not what brings me back every time, but it's noteworthy.    Come on your birthday and get a free b-day sized pizookie!! Yum!  They don't sing either which is a bonus, but their pizookies are amaaaaazing!!!  I've never seen one disappear so quickly as they do when placed in front of my kids!!",

We felt like when we flagged her down we would need to ask for everything because there was a chance we wouldn't see her again for another 20 minutes or so.  Usually get better service than this.   Food was good as always. Fettuccini Alfredo is yummy. I love the small bites. Got crispy artichokes and the bruschetta. If you don't eat a lot id recommend ordering some small bites and maybe sharing an entree with someone. That's a good amount.   As always order the pizookie for dessert! You can't pass on it. Good place to come with a group. Try their beers or do the beer sampler. Overall the food is good here. Service varies.",

I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic \"gentleman\" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor, he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check, he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table, laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check, but he refused. A large, black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit, a short, white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn't even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn't care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white, I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you. But if you are white (like myself and two friends), the wait staff will be slow to take your order, show no interest in your table and spend all of their time slacking off or speaking to other non-white tables. BJs is just another racist business that hates whites.",

Went to BJS on  eastern tonight for daughters birthday...waitress Nicole served us all one beer and appetizers,...after what was to be our second and last /only had had one /she arrived at the table and rudely and loudly announced we could have another but husband couldn't. Never asked if he possibly had drank too much! He was humiliated. Manager was just as rude as he said she wasn't rude(he never heard it) this was the most unprofessional manager in a restaurant, ever -way over his head and horrible people skills. Needless to say our night was  ruined no one offered any apologies. The waitress and manager shiwed total disrespect  and we will never return. Horrible horrible customer service .",

    "text": "This location should have a \"no coloreds\" sign in the window so i know not to enter next time. I walk in was seated fairly quick and so after 20minutes of sitting and no acknowledgement from anyone on a half busy night, i go tell the hostess about the situation, she tells me \"oh im sorry about that\" and acts like she goes to look for help, i go back to sit down thinkin someone is coming to take care of us, WRONG, what i see is the people who were seated 10/15 minutes after me being served, meanwhile i still havent even been acknowledged, that was my cue to leave. I would love to think race wasnt the case but theres no proof of that, there was about 5 black people total there including me & my gf, sadly enough the \"manager\" was black one busser and one bar tender. The manager excuse was that shes sorry and that \"they know better\" very insincere and uncaring. After barely giving two fucks and doing nothing about the situation she said she would love us to stay and eat, i declined w no hesitation. Me and my gf are very polite good people we didnt deserve that kindve treatment, &even during this whole thing were never rude spoke loud at anyone or anything of that magnitude. Sad i had to find out this way",

    "text": "Consistently good; great BIG menu & draft beers; what can be bad?  This location is in Summerlin, across from the Red Rock Hotel.  When you don't want to mess with the downtown/strip area...this is a good choice for an alternate place to grab some grub with the locals.    As with all the BJ's, the pizza, brews, salads, and tons of other items, desserts (can you say pizzookie?)...it's all good stuff. Plus, lunch & happy hour, and late hour specials.  My favorite thing on the menu (for years now, and I never tire): the BBQ Chicken Chop...which I feel is the best I've ever had (sorry CPK).  Salads don't travel well, but everything else is served in HUGE capacity and get read for a 'take home' box.  The service is very good at this location.  The only downsides is that it gets awfully busy, and parking is difficult to get in the front of the restaurants (shared with other restaurants), so you often have to park on the backside and walk a bit around a large building.",

    "text": "We like the food there but the front end service is getting worse and worse with each visit.  They offer the opportunity to put our names on the list online to save us time once we get there.  When I do this I always put in a note that we are a party of 6, 4 adults 2 kids and we need 1 high chair.  On our most recent visit  we were told the wait would be 25 more minutes, after 25 minutes it was \"oh, the booth we had for you cannot handle the high chair....so it will be another 20 minutes.  Ummmm, why didn't you look at my note in the first place??  The place is always busy, always packed and you end up tripping on people who are waiting. The front end staff just seems useless and clueless.  Once we were seated we had to ask twice for silverware.  \"I will try and find you some\".  You are a restaurant, you don't have silverware?  It was really nice of you to give the kids \"appetizers\" while we waited for silverware and to order but without silverware it is hard for them to eat..... The only reason we did not just walk away was I had a gift certificate to use up.  Even with their promos I am going to be hard pressed to go back there any time soon.",

    "text": "Never had a horrible experience while dining in and their food is amazing. One of my favorite places to go get burgers and pasta. But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in), EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils, ingredients, sauces, sides, etc. For example, I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online, only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three, they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do, and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order, but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not, every time I go in to pick it up, they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what, but as a busy person, it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself, but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's, but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big, chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's), I pack everything (sauces, entrees, desserts, sides, etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything. So either they do it differently at BJ's or the takeout specialist doesn't know how read and check the order. This really makes me not want to order takeout from BJ's anymore.",
