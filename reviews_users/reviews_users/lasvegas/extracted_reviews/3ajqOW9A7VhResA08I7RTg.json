Our server was polite, helpful and professional. He made some recommendations on drinks and food. He warned us the portions are large, and he was right. When the food arrived it was hot and looked great. It tasted good, but it's nothing extremely special. It's essentially huge portions of diner food with a slight twist. Nothing to make a huge deal out of.  It is a place worth returning to though.  Give it a shot for yourself.",

Maybe it's because I was more than slightly hungover from the night before, but when the famous fried chicken benedict arrived at the table, my stomach almost felt worse. It's so huge and hard to figure out where to start. I basically ate the mashed potatoes and a bit of the chicken, and left the rest to the bf and to save for later (we slowly finished it throughout the rest of the day as we waited for our flight home). On top of the benedict, bf also got a salmon scramble and we were surprised it was thoroughly cooked though it was supposed to be smoked. I've had smoked salmon scrambles elsewhere where the salmon was still light and refreshing.  As others have said, you can probably order 1 dish for every 2 people, but if you really want to try a lot of things, just be okay with having a lot of leftovers.",

It was a Tuesday morning about 10am - no wait.   Our server was nice and gave us a run down of the menu and gave us a few recommendations. I went with the chicken and waffles (of course). After placing our order, it was about 10 mins before our food came out.   OMG! There's no way I'm going to finish this, and I was already planning how I was going to drop off my leftovers back at my hotel. 4 waffles on the plate, and 2 chicken breast in the middle and a knife stuck in the chicken. Lots of garnishes which I just knocked off the plate to get to the good stuff. The waffle has bacon right in it - no not bits. Actual bacon strips. The chicken was good, not overcooked. I was only able to finish 1 waffle and 1 chicken. The rest was taken back to the hotel.  Definitely gonna come back and try some other dishes.",

We were seated and greeted right away and given our drinks within five minutes. The tea/fresh lemonade is very good!  As for meals, we were naive about the sizes. We can usually eat Cheesecake Factory meals in 1-2 sittings, but these bad boys could feed a family of four(seriously, the bowl of my chicken pot pie was a family-sized serving bowl). Hubby and I both ordered a side salad, which were both the size of 3-4 side salads elsewhere. Could easily be split by 2-4 people, as an FYI. Hubby loved his mixed greens salad with macadamia nuts and said it was unique and the sweet vinaigrette complimentary. My Caesar salad was pretty basic with only four croutons and an over-abundance of manufactured parm cheese. Would have liked more crunch or additions of tomatoes/cucumbers. The four small corn croutons had a stale taste and odd texture. Get a different salad.   Our son liked his cheese quesadilla(which was very big) and the \"fruit garnish\" is a slice of orange and cantaloupe. Hubby loved his sage chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist, crispy, and well-flavored white meat. The waffles were fluffy yet crisp. He had a second meal from his leftovers.   My chicken pot pie tastes similar to chicken and biscuits. They first put down what looks like a huge cracker hat and then fill it with a creamy chicken stew. Lots of veggies, which were fresh and great. Some were undercooked and hard (potatoes and carrots) but it was otherwise tasty. Nothing super unique about the taste of the dish aside from the hat...err...crust. It was delicious, crisp and flaky but a nice chew inside. I would imagine that I will get four meals out of this dish.   I would go back but go at breakfast and order sage chicken benedict. Breakfast seems to be the star.",

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go was a convenient spot for my family and I to have lunch at due to the fact that it is located right in the entrance of the Plaza Hotel and Casino. We hopped off our long flight and decided to grab a quick bite to eat after checking in at the hotel. My brother had been to this establishment before and actually recommended it to me, so I was actually really excited to have lunch here.  The restaurant definitely gets a star for their friendly staff. Our waitress there patiently took our orders and brought us everything we asked for in a timely manner. She had a cheery attitude and overall, made me feel much less stressed after my long travels. Later that night, I also came back to drop in to the bar to order that Watermelon Cocktail that the hotel had advertised on every wall. The bartender was also friendly and helped me out with my drinks quickly. They do some pretty cool drinks and that warrants another star. During that lunch break I ordered a banana latte, which was fantastic. The warmth and general sweetness gave me a sense of nostalgia and made me feel like I was home. The Watermelon Cocktail that I got later on was also very good. Not too sweet and not too sour. Overall I was very happy with those.  Unfortunately, I was not that impressed with my meal. I ordered a mushroom burger and fries. I love mushrooms--usually I'll eat anything that it's smothered in--however, my burger tasted like it was lacking some flavor. I can't put my finger on what it was missing, but it just seemed sort of soggy and bland. The fries were great though and that really lightening the whole plate. The atmosphere was as you could expect from a hotel lobby restaurant. The entire place was flooded with that strange smell that floats throughout the Plaza Hotel, almost like old cologne mixed in with the trademark Las Vegas cigarette smoke.  All in all, I'll probably dip back in for a drink or two if I'm ever in the Fremont Street area again, but I'll hit up a different place for lunch.",

If you wake up with a hangover, this place will definitely cure you! I can't imagine how unhealthy the food may be, but it is freakin' delicious!  The service however, could've been better. Our server looked like he wasn't enjoying his job very much. But whatever, the food was great.  WARNING: Do not order your own dish and expect to eat the whole thing. The portion are extremely large. One dish could fill 1-3 people up, depending on how much they can eat.",

Ed, a bigger & much older gentleman, supposedly the manager, is so unbelievably rude. He came over to us, and immediately said \"Move your luggage, this is a walkway\". (He literally commanded me). Not only is the walkway about 4 people wide and my tiny suitcase is the size of a small dog, but as I dropped my phone and clearly struggled to put my very heavy suitcase under my feet, he watched me struggle and didn't once offer to help. Note, he stood there staring for the full duration of me putting it away. As a woman, I've never struggled in front of a man who didn't offer to assist me. It wasn't even busy, at all. I mean, I was STRUGGLING, and he just scoffed & walked off. Nothing like having to enjoy a meal with your feet uncomfortably sitting on your luggage. We watched him ask, \"how's it going?\" to various other tables right next to us, but never came back to us. The food really is fantastic, but as a place that serves primarily breakfast foods, how do run out of orange juice? Next time that happens, just send Ed to get more oranges. He wouldn't be missed. I'd opt for another location if you can.",

    "text": "Brunch day with my cousin!  I woke up wanting to grub on some food and have a few cocktails.  When I thought about brunch, I thought about this place!  I've been fortunate enough to the check out the M Resort location, I suggested we go and try the Plaza hotel location.  The look is very consistent to the south location.  You have table tops, you have booths.  Lots of wood and metal lining the tables and walls.  Tables have grains in vases.  It's exactly what they advertise:  Twisted Farm Food (and Decor).  I decided to sit at the bar and was helped by Mandy (blonde bartender).  She was nice and super timely.  For brunch, we started with mimosas for $6.95 each.  Served with an orange slice, this drink contains orange juice with lots of pulp, so be advised.  Not a problem for me, but I know some folks don't like pulp.  It still did the trick!  For my meal, I had the popular Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles for $16.95.  This dish was lined with bacon waffles with two huge breast pieces of Sage Fried chicken, accompanied with fried leaks, hot maple caramel reduction and a sprig of rosemary.  The chicken was amazing!  Super juicy for a breast, the batter was crunchy and seasoned very well!  Home run for me :)  another home run was the bacon waffles.  There's not just bits of bacon, but entire strips of bacon!  The syrup was on point, thick and sweet and really enhanced the overall flavor!!  What I didn't like was the fried leaks.  They were everywhere and made the plate look super sloppy.  Thank goodness they were edible because they kept getting in all bite.  Little irritating but not a huge deal.  What was a huge deal for me was the fact that my cousin's dish came out and I waiting more than 5 minutes until my dish came out.  I understand her dish was just a scramble, however, they should be aware of ticket times so the entire party gets their meals at once.    Other than that, I would still return to this place.  What I've learned about Hash House is that it's affordable and really packed with flavor.  The crowds of people that wait for a table, no matter the location, is proof that this place rocks!  If you're downtown, come on by and check this place out!",

The size of the plates alone took up 1/4 of the table.  The amount of food you get is absolutely ridiculous.  Plus the honey biscuits they give you... OMG they have to be a pound apiece.    I had the famous chicken and waffles and almost had an orgasm at the table.  The waffles had bacon cooked into them and the fried chicken was perfection.  It had real maple syrup on it too, not that fake crap.    My friends got meatloaf and stuffed hamburgers.  All you heard during dinner was \"Ohhh my god this is soooo goooood!\".    Our waiter was awesome and gave us the souvenir drink glasses for free.  I wanted to try the bacon bloody mary but my tummy was telling me NO!!!!  The prices were more reasonable then I thought they would be.   For 2 people to eat like pigs and bring more than half the food home, along with drinks, was only $37.    After dinner we waddled back to our hotel and laid in the hot tub for a few hours to digest.  Then after a few hours of drinking and gambling, we ate our leftovers and they were even better!  LOL  I've heard they just opened a new location in Chicago and I'm definitely going to find it!  Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't or I'll be broke and weigh 400 pounds!",

I decided to go for the chicken salad sandwich with salad and my friend got the chicken and waffles, which she said she always gets cause it's that darn good!  Her food came out first and I waited about another 10 min before I got my food.  When I did, I was not disappointed!  My sandwich was HUGE! I had to take a minute to wrap my head and mouth around it.  But, it was DELICIOUS!  I also tried some of my friend's chicken and that was delicious as well.    The amount of food we got for the price was well worth it.  We both had leftovers, which we munched on later.  Everyone thanked us as we left, which was really nice and pretty rare to see that everyone stops to thank you for your business as you leave.",

I ordered the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & swiss scramble which came out with fluffy eggs and stuffed with bacon and avocado. Got a brown sugar and banana pancake as a side... but it was 14\" wide! Super tasty, and fluffy, that is a winning pancake.   The boys ordered the Sage Fried chicken, chicken and waffles, and chicken fried steak. The chicken is cranky on the outside, moist on the inside and fills you to the brim. We left with full tummy, smiles on our faces, and lots of doggy bags.  Servies was friendly and this place was defo worth the wait.",

    "text": "Recommended by a friend and didn't disappoint! H-U-G-E Portions reasonably priced and the food is tasty and delicious. The service was excellent and the wait staff more than accommodating. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we didn't actually get to taste the dinners but the food we saw go by looked delicious and everyone took home extras. And what presentation on the food! We had a coupon for a free dinner but went too early to use it. Our waiter was able to get it applied to our appetizers and and gave us a complimentary drink. So during happy hour we had 3 appetizers and 2 drinks for $5. And we were stuffed! And it was delicious, we couldn't have eaten a meal after that. The wings we're spicy, large and had great flavor. Not Buffalo wings but just as tasty. The bacon was delectable and the fried pickles yummy. Definitely recommend!",

Oh yeah and their lame wifi does not work for guests. So yea, you'll get pretty bored waiting here.   Service was horrible here too. Server totally neglected us, forgot utensils, forgot our requests, etc. I got the Marshmallow Mocha drink which was way too sweet...   They have GINORMOUS portions so you should just share. My fiance and I just ended up sharing the chicken and waffles plate which was just okay. The breading of the chicken was a little mushy and not crispy. Even though we shared, we only finished probably 2/3 of the food.  Ugh. would not come back. Waste of money, time, and calories!",

The country fried steak with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. The steak was fine very well and the potatoes were as well.  The last thing we had was the crab cake Benedict. It had a bit of heat to it but was really good.  There was large chunks of crab in the cake and it was seasoned well.  While eating the power went out for a brief moment.

The chicken & waffles is huge, but bland.  I asked to purchase the sauce that goes on the Man v Food chicken dish (it is cheesy and spicy).  It was awesome and that helped make the chicken and waffles a dish I wanted to continue to eat.  The red velvet pancake is huge but they put hardly any cream cheese frosting on it. So it was dry. We had to ask for more frosting. The pancake itself was hard to eat as it just fell apart.  Not so great.   The worst part honestly was the service.  I think our waitress did not want to be at work today.  She was nice but brief.  Our food took FOREVER (& we were lucky to get there before the rush - we arrived around 9:30a and were seated immediately). Our waitress never acknowledged our food issue.  She did a good job of filling our coffee, but I'm not exaggerating when I say it took a solid 45 min to get our food (& there were only 4 us).  I don't blame her for the food timing but please at least acknowledge there's an issue.",

My friend's drink was 2x as much as mine, so it's not like we got the same thing. Anyway, then we went to sit down and our waitress took our order, our food came out at different times to the point that I felt bad my friend was waiting for me and then the waitress didn't check in on us till we pulled her aside to ask for the check.

Upon being immediately seated, our waiter was there to get our drink orders.   I will say their service was top notch and perfect!  Our drinks never went empty and the waiter was the definition of great customer service.   After ordering our food, it was out in the blink of an eye!    I had ordered the Cobb Salad.  Yes, this huge portion was more than I could handle.  It was definitely something I could have shared.  But the salads flavor and ingredients were just ok.  It was filled with plenty of lettuce but kinda skimped on the toppings.  The ratio was way off.  The chicken that was on the salad seemed to be out of a can.  Bummer.   I would have though they would have seasoned it before putting it on the salad but I was wrong.    Yes, their servings are enormous but then lack in quality.  Service deserves all of the praise!",

    "text": "First off, this place is FUN!!  You're greeted by smiling faces when you make your way into this cool, hip restaurant that's right inside the lobby.  This place was packed during both times that I have been there for breakfast.  Even though they were packed; the bartenders (I sat at the bar since it was so packed) and waitresses were extremely friendly!  Even if you come in STARVING; I don't see how you can finish one of their \"Benedicts\".  They've become some of the best meals that I've ever had for breakfast.  This time, I tried their Blue Crab Benedict.  Let me tell you something...These guys DO NOT CHINCH on the crab!!! I got 2 really large crab cakes that were smothered in some of the most complex and delicious sauces and ingredients you could find while eating out.    While waiting for breakfast (this food is freshly cooked, so you'll wait a bit), I knocked back a perfectly made Bloody Mary at their bar.  This didn't have any store bought cheapo mix..It's their own mix and it's one of the best I've had.    Since the bar had great TV's, I ended up spending the ENTIRE DAY there!! I'm not kidding!  I watched 2 NFL playoff games, and was surrounded by nothing but friendly people as I bought bucket after bucket of beer (5 for $14)!  This place is one of two GREAT restaurants; not only in Downtown; but in Vegas PERIOD!  The food, and the Plaza Hotel are both huge reasons why Downtown Vegas is getting better each year.",

Known for its enormous portions and perhaps even more famous in Las Vegas than at home in the Golden State, it was first to a substantial wait for a table despite the restaurant being almost 2/3 empty that we stood at the podium after arriving at 8:30, another protracted delay to follow as servers seemed completely lost as to who was responsible for which table, then further complicated  by a similar wait for both food as well as drinks.  Not one to suffer such annoyances well, particularly after an early rise and nearly twelve-mile early morning run, it was finally after wondering aloud why such a delay was taking place that coffee was refilled and plates began to trickle forth, the benedict still fifteen minutes away with a steaming block of bread pudding oddly arriving first.  Previously impressed by the molten brownie topped in chocolate, caramel, and nuts with ice cream slowly forming a pool of creamy vanilla sauce, it was after a few bites that attention was turned to the hubcap sized pancake studded in the similar flavors of Snickers that attention was turned, the buttermilk largely overwhelming the candybar when topped in butter and pure maple syrup brought from home while the French Toast was rich with the flavors of cinnamon and vanilla custard plus skin-on bananas, the presentation a bit slipshod though perhaps also the most \"down home.\"  Always attuned to the presence of biscuits, those at Hash House a Go-Go of the larger, fluffier variety popular throughout the Midwest, it was alongside the signature chicken that a quartet of golden rounds was brought forth, each amongst the best in Sin City while the mountainous Benedict buried the one included beneath crispy well-seasoned bird and fresh vegetables, the addition of bacon, cheese, at least three eggs, and smoky cream sauce no doubt making the Man vs. Food Classic a dish best shared.  Offering more support than most for the sort of early morning gluttony through which  Hash House a Go-Go has made its name it may warrant further visits to determine precisely why the service was so awful during this visit to the one at the Plaza, but unless one is restricted by transportation the better bet would seem to be a trip to the locations with better service (and free parking) on Sahara, 24/7 in the Rio, or Stripside at The Linq.",

I have gone to the one in SD many times and wanted to see if they could keep the consistency.  The food was okay. I was a little disappointed. The mashed potatoes and the gravy did not taste fresh, kind of tasted like something that came out of a box. The chicken breast was soggy from the frying. It was meh.  HOWEVER, their Bloody Mary's are off the hook wonderful! If nothing else go for a bloody and same eggs. Seriously, I would go back just for them. (Notice how I am saying THEY) The mix is just the right amount of spice and they don't go easy on the good stuff. The coffee is good ole diner coffee too. So A PLUS on the liquids.  The restaurant is located inside the Plaza Hotel; right in front of the main entrance. This makes it extremely easy to get to, especially if you are wandering up and down Fremont.",

Unable to order the praised pancakes, since there were no gluten free options, I opted for a scramble filled with sun-dried tomato, basil and goat cheese: three ingredients destined for perfection. It was to come with potatoes and fruit and a side of bacon (which was an extra $3.95) when my food arrived it looked delicious and promising, but my side of bacon was rather sad and turned out to be cold. When I asked for a new side of bacon some was brought to me immediately and I'm convinced it was simply because it was microwaved. I'm guessing so because I've microwaved plenty of bacon myself. As for the scramble, it was good, but not the best I've had and the potatoes although tasty were not evenly cooked.   The service was good, but the overall experience was not worth the price/the hype.",

But don't assume I am a low class citizen until I do something that warrants such treatment.    My son's pancakes were supposed to have chocolate chips. They arrived plain. Our six orders didn't arrive together. The last order arrived a full 1/2 hour after the first order.   We asked for a bottle of ketchup. They said weren't allowed to give a whole bottle. .. Really?!? Is there a ketchup shortage in Vegas I'm not aware of?   I will probably not come back here by choice.   The saving grace is the food which is consistently good.",

Two pieces of perfectly  battered fried chicken with waffles, bacon and tomatoes garnished with fried green onions and a rosemary stem made for a totally satisfying meal.  This dish was huge!  The chicken was not greasy at all and had a lightly seasoned with sage batter that came out crispy.    The guy next to me ordered their pork eggs benedict.  The waitress said that there are 18 ounces of chicken fried pork alone in that dish.  She said Adam from Man vs Food ate this dish.  Very good value for the money.  I'd eat here again in a heartbeat, but my arteries would probably kill me if I made this a habit.",

I will say the same thing I said on my review of the Hash House at the Linq-the portion sizes are huge and can be a little intimidating, but that is their thing.  You have been warned.  The food also comes out fresh as it is made so you might not get it all at once, but at least it isn't just sitting back there.  Depending on what time of day you come, you might be waiting for a little while, but I think that it's worth it.  I know some will disagree, but you can't please everyone, right?!  I had breakfast for dinner (brinner) that consisted of pecan french toast with maple syrup and golden bananas with a side of bacon and scrambled eggs.  It was wonderful.  My husband had a chicken dish served with the pumpkin mashed potatoes and a tomato compote on top.  It was incredible!  I kept sneaking bites. Everyone needs to experience this place at least once!",

The chicken pieces were huge and crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The waffle were fluffy. Together the chicken and waffles are a perfect pair, then adding the syrup...is like taste buds heaven. The meal was so big, I tried to eat all of it but couldn't. But it was a great meal.   This Hash House location gives an older vibe and it was hard to walk through especially with a stroller. But the restaurant is clean and the staff is super friendly. I would definitely eat here again.",

She didnt say anything just kept organizing the menus as if her job wasnt to host but to organize menus. I had to say what do you need? She said name. Phone number. I gave her the information and then she continued to do what she was doing. It's sad to find young people who dont want to work and have no manners. Blah. Didnt stay to eat.

Two of my companions shared one of the hashes and couldn't even finish their huge dish! Our waitress was friendly and efficient once she got to our table...that would be my only issue, costing them a star - it was busy and took extra time to get to us to take drink orders.  She redeemed herself by quickly getting our orders and then the kitchen got them out quickly and beautifully presented!

I ordered the chicken and waffles and she ordered the sage fried chicken.   It was all not fulfilling. It did not have any seasoning and salt and pepper did not help. There are so many good reviews about this place and the items we ordered I just knew it would be a great experience but it was not.   2 orders of food And 2 beers ended up being 60 something. I won't be going to this hash house again. I do however want to give them another try since Las Vegas raves about it.. I'm just gonna day this wasn't the one for me and try a different location.   It was my dates b day as I previously stated and the waitress said we both can get a free shot and she brought us a b day cake shot I believe she called it but we ended up paying for it anyway. The service was slow and we just didn't have a good time. I hope other do.. looks good but looks are deceiving..",

My husband ordered their signature or the most popular dish - Andy's Sage fried chicken which was humongous and delicious ! Also their service was on point... our server was so knowledgeable and thorough with everything with honest opinion which helped us make our orders. Definitely coming back to this place .

Told the hostess we had a party of 3 maybe 4. She had the worst attitude. She told us we \"needed to figure it out\". We could see an empty booth and said we'd take the available one that we could plainly see from the hostess stand. She sighed, walked away to apparently see if there was something available. Came back and asked if we wanted a booth or table when we had just said a booth. I have NEVER in 5 years of coming here had such a bad experience here. If Du-pars was still open at the Golden Gate across the street, we would have left and gone there. Our waiter, Jeronimo, was very apologetic so he is the bright spot. He gets 5 stars. However, one of our breakfasts arrived over cooked but cold. What the heck is going on here today?  We may be finding a new breakfast spot. Which is disheartening. We usually love this place. I hope others have a better experience.",

I would definitely recommend coming here at least once. If I lived Vegas, it wouldn't be a place I come often.  Food - 4/5   My Chicken and Waffles were great. That sage paired very well with the chicken and syrup. My only disappointment was that they didn't give me enough syrup. Also, that watermelon ice tea was on point!!! So unique and refreshing! My SO had Corn hash and she was disappointed. The beef was not cooked crispy like she wanted. I am guessing they cook everything with a twist here so everything might be made in a different way.

So... first we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which was so darn good! Recently we've been trying CFS at various restaurants we've visited w/in 3 states and this one is definitely in my top 2. The potatoes under the the gravy were amazing as well!  Second item we ordered was the French Toast dipped in banana cream, w/ pecans and fried banana. This was so delicious, no syrup was needed, so sweet as is.  Can't wait to return!  P.S. If you stay at the Plaza Hotel they give you a lil coupon book that has a coupon for $5 off your bill.",

The ambiance is industial gothic with perfect lighting, diamond plating, steel topped tables and vlack and red coloring.   For breakfast today I went with the banana and pecan infused french toast With two over easy eggs 2 slices of bacon and fried taters. The french toast was perfectly gridle friend to a delicious golden brown, topped with one whole in the skin banana and a generous amount of pecans a mouth watering delight! Bacon is bacon and eggs are eggs, both perfectly cooked to order. The fried taters were perfectly crunchy but lacked seasoning. The coffee was a 2 bean roast with the most awesome Caffeine punch around. Fresh squeezed orange juice tops it off. Grade A++  The waitstaff was friendly and the time to order and for the meal to arrive on our table was less than 15 minutes.  Over all on my next return to Las Vegas this is definately on my food eateries list.  Dayne",

    "text": "If you are into a hearty breakfast, and you also enjoy being told \"Ask us about our beers\" as you are seated, you must consider Hash House in the Plaza Casino for breakfast or brunch. My experience here was based on this, and I left completely satisfied and beyond full. If you're a party of 6 or more, you may have problems getting a table, so do consider the bar, especially if you want a beer. The selection is varied, the bartender knowledgeable.   Obviously with a name like Hash House, the lure - and the top items on the menu - will be the hashes. These are huge, served in iron skillet-pans. They aren't your traditional hashes with the meats and potatoes nicely cut into small cubes. This is more like pulled meat with whatever else is included, on top of a pile of home fries, usually with 2 eggs and a jumbo biscuit with a large sprig of rosemary growing out of it for garnish and optional flavor. One person in our group opted for pancakes instead, and he was told not to order quite as many as he wanted - and rightly so. The pancakes were larger than the plate, probably larger than a Frisbee.   The price of breakfast here, not counting coffee, was perhaps a few bucks more than a breakfast buffet at one of the better hotels on Fremont St., but I left here equally full and more satisfied in terms of quality. If I had to label anything in the area as \"best hangover brunch,\" a hash breakfast here would win.",

Our server was fast and friendly, understood they needed to go, got there order out to them fast and dropped the check off  without any issues. I love a place that can work with you like that.  After checking out the menu, I found out that it was a full menu, you could order lunch as well as breakfast, I was happy for that because this time I was not in the mood for breakfast, though their biscuits and gravy are killer!   I went with the BBQ chicken sandwich, bbq chicken breast covered in sauce, topped with onion rings and cilantro on a whole wheat bun, I sure wasn't trying to be heathy, but this was what I wanted! And for not additional price you can swap out the fries for their famous mashed potatoes, just do it!!! Those mashed potatoes are the bomb!! So good!  The sandwich was perfect, so dang tasty, I could have gone for a little bit more sauce, I liked saucy, but other than that, it was delish baby!  My friend ordered the chicken and waffles, and if you haven't seen them, they are huge and had some waffle up for grab, heck yea I tried one, that waffle was stuffed with BACON!!! OMG, BACON stuffed waffle!! Man next time I come back Ill have to remember to order that!   I really enjoy Hash House, it's a definite stop whenever in Vegas.",

Especially after we've heard nothing but good things about this place. So you definitely will not leave there hungry, BUT if you get Donna Server #516 beware. Her customer service skills were very unprofessional from the minute we sat down. I watched and heard the waiter (had a ponytail) the next table over and he was very friendly and actually explained a little bit of the menu and even asked if they've been the before.  Didn't get any of that from Donna. Too many things to list regarding her poor costumer service,  but the worst one was when we were checking out. She brought us our receipt and didn't say one word if she was going to take our payment or if we pay up front. So we waited for her to come by, and we asked her if we she took our payment or do we pay up front? Her answer was \"well I gave you the receipt, I'll take it\". Just because she gave us the receipt, doesn't mean they take thr payment for you.   She walked away, so I put my card with the receipt.  She came back and to a table near by without checking on our take and walked away again.  So now we're waiting longer, so I started to get inpatient by this time. She went back to the same table and started to take their order, so I excused myself and let her know we were waiting for her. She replied \"um I'm taking there order\" so we proceeded to walk out to find the manager. As we were walking away she was making comments about me to her customers at the  table. I got the managers attention told him what happened and he apologized. As I walked out of the restaurant and looked over at me laughing and waiving.  I felt that she was mocking me, so at this point I was very upset so I went and spoke with the manager again and he apologized again. IF I ever try this place again I will definitely make sure I don't sit at any of her tables.",

In the mean time, the waiter came up to me and said the reason why we dont have our food at the same time, is because there are no heat lamps.  First of all, I never made any comment on why my food was the only one on the table.  I guess he needed to rectify the mistake, but after he said such a ridiculous statement, I replied, \"we didnt have this problem at the other Hash House\".  He walked away,  Then the manager came up to the table with my husbands food and told us the same thing about the heat lamps. OMG. no reply from me.  They werent friendly AT ALL and spoke to me as if I were a total idiot.  Next time I will be heading to the Hash House on Sahara.  They managed to get our party of 8's food out at the same time and were very friendly  Helpful Hint: You should have started the other meal first.",

I don't see why all the negative reviews but I had a pleasant experience here.  The service was friendly, no one dropped my food on the floor.  The coffee was piping hot and the level never was allowed to hit the bottom.  I really enjoyed my basic breakfast.  My husband got an apple pancake and the thing was huge.  Even he could not finish it and he is usually the one who finished my plate when we go out.  Now that is a lot of food.    I forget what was here before the Plaza remodeled, but everything looks new.  The place is near the check in of the hotel and right off Fremont street so it's an easy walking distance if you happen to be staying somewhere else or even if you wanted to park at another casino.  I'm not aching to go back but I would eat here again.",

    "text": "i went here on friday night around 12AM with a party of 8. we were already staying in downtown vegas, so we decided to go to this new location of hash house. ive been to the one in san diego so i expected the same. it is located in the lobby of The Plaza hotel, which was recently renovated. the lobby looked pretty cool. like an old hotel trying to be strip worthy. anyway, we were seated right away. there were only a few other parties in the restaurant at the time and we were seated in a long booth, which kind of was annoying if you were sitting in the inside and needed to get out to go to the restroom or something.   anyway, the bf and i ordered the sage fried chicken benedict. i had this at the san diego location and it was pretty good. the bf hadnt had it before, so we decided to split it since i wasnt that hungry anyway. the waitress says \"that will be a $2.50 charge to split it... or you can get a side order of something if you want...\" so i look over the menu and all the side orders were $4.50. maybe if i was hungry, i might have just ordered a side of fries or something but i knew i wasnt gonna eat much so we just decided to suck it up and pay the $2.50. i should have just not said anything to begin with and just ate off the bfs plate. oh well. you win some you lose some. this benedict came with a chipotle sauce on top instead of the usual hollandaise sauce which was a bit spicy. personally i think the dish tastes better with the original sauce.   my cousin got the meatloaf sandwich, which was a huge sandwich in between 2 or 3 inch slices of bread. the meatloaf was actually pretty bland. my other cousin got the sage fried chicken, eggs, smashed potatoes and biscuit. i forgot what its called, but it was basically like the benedict but without the sauce on top. my cousin asked for a side of gravy and the waitress again said there would be a charge. no thanks.   a friend got the fried chicken sandwich, which was the sage fried chicken in between the same 2-3 inch slices of bread. he said it was good. it came with a side of fries which i tasted and thought it was pretty salty. another friend got a regular breakfast plate of eggs, smashed potatoes, ham and biscuit.   i wanted to try the chicken and waffles since it has slices of bacon within the waffle. but they stop serving the chicken and waffles at 11PM. boo. oh well, its okay though because more than one person after wards said that the waffles arent that good anyway.   overall i was disappointed. i wont be back and i dont recommend it.",

Luckily we paid in cash and did not need change. Most of the servers don't seem very happy to be there.

Someone came by and haphazardly asks have we been helped. I say no and he says oh she'll be over in a minute. Again another employee couldn't be bothered to let the bartender know we were there.

It's quite a shame, my sister (with me right now) and I have worked in the service industry for 10 plus years now and still currently do! We're good tippers! Maybe the employees there should learn a thing about being a team that COMMUNICATES with not only their guests but their coworkers as well. Extremely disappointed considering we literally wanted two drinks and would most likely tip 10$ on those two drinks if the service is prompt and friendly. We love hooking up our fellow service industry people but we can't do that if you deliberately ignore us. FAIL!!",

Finally brought to our table, hubby ordered corned beef  eggs, biscuit. Took forever and a day to get his order, the waiter simply forgot mine, brought hubby a large plate with his meal...I told him not to wait his food would get cold, as I watched him eat, the waiter finally came back to see how we liked it...I asked when my order as coming, he said you did not order anything, I clarified that indeed I had and that he was suppose to give the avocado part to my husband, which he never received. He say oh oh hey yeah oh wait I will bring it now, we waited another 10 minutes then I told the waiter forget the order. He said no I will bring it right now, I insisted no. So I tried to share some of my husbands breakfast, yuck if I had wanted hash I would have ordered hash, biscuit was hard and bland, no butter no jelly. Nada... Will NOT be going back after all the raves. From fam and friends nope wont to ever again. Was not impressed if I want a tree of rosemary on my plate I can stay home for that, I have a rosemary bush outside. Blahh",

I had the meatloaf sandwich, when it was brought out to me, I had to devise a strategy to eat it, it was so big.  But eat it I did, the whole thing, although it wasn't pretty.  Might not be the place to take a first date, since there is no dignified way to eat eat this sandwich.  But, oh lords, was it good.  Delicious meatloaf, a tasty homemade ketchup, and a fresh bun.  So, so good.  Fries were not bad either, but I could only eat about three of them after polishing off the sandwich.  Then I was fed for the day, maybe two days.  It was so good.  I ate at the bar, the bartender was very sweet and brought me everything I needed, including extra napkins.  I gave her a good tip because, well, she had to watch me eat that thing.  Place was very nice overall, cool decor with a lot of stainless steel.  So go there soon.  But only if you are seriously hungry.  You've been warned.",

You have a decent view of the Fremont street.  Also located next to the check in desk.    The restaurant itself, did look a bit small, but decent in a way.  Very well decorated and color scheme seems to be dark but warming in the same way.  Staff seems to be nice and entertaining.  Service was decent and average.    The menu was a bit confusing, but ordered a Tractor driver combo, that had eggs, bacon and pancake.  The waitress asked if I wanted one of their famous pancakes and got the Apple Cinnamon pancake.  The wait was decent, and when the food came, I didn't realize how big the pancake was.  It was bigger than expected and it was actually good.  I wasn't able to finish it, but it was decent and presentation was good.    My recommendation, its a good morning place to have breakfast.  The food was cooked decently and the portions are bigger than usual.  If you are in the area, try it out.",

The bloody mary was great, was fresh and had plenty of spice.  Half of the table, at the recommendation of Man Vs. Food, got the fried chicken benedict.  This is the ultimate heavy hangover food and, although they could've dialed down the spice in the sauce, was tasty.  The other half of the table tried the chicken and waffles, which were a bit disappointing: the chicken was a bit dry, and the waffles, despite having bacon in the middle, were just ok.    It was a bit expensive though.  Breakfast for 5 (not everyone got a drink) for $100.

Located in The Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown in Las Vegas, which is where we were staying proved to be a convenient place to get some serious farm food!!  The HH bloody marys started off the morning perfectly.  Not too thick like some tend to be, but with just the right amount of heat.  Tasty!!  It was closer to lunch so we opted for burgers.  My buddy and I could've shared one, they're so huge!  I had the blue cheese with bacon and side of fries.  Two patties covered in their thick cut bacon and melted blue cheese stuffed into the huge patties that dwarfed the buns.  We're talking ginormous!!  It was delicious.  My friend and just had a discussion about goat cheese on a burger, and lo and behold, goat cheese and jalapeno!!!!!  It was a truly delicious way to start and end the day as took the other half back to our room to enjoy later!  This is not my first time here and everything is delicious! Don't get me started on the drink menu, but I had a watermelon kiwi lemonade.  YUM!",

The corned beef in the corned beef hash was really tasty, but what was with the watermelon and pineapple slices with corned beef, potatoes and eggs? The fried angel hair pasta that comes with every entree was just silly too...I don't know if it was just poorly executed...has anyone else ever seen sticks of fried angel hair pasta with dinner? The whole branch of rosemary as a garnish was weird too.  The service was pretty good. That and the corned beef are saving the place from one star.

Whenever we visit Vegas we eat at Hash House, usually multiple times.  Their fried chicken is the stuff of dreams, and their BLT Blood Mary holds a special place in my heart.  Seriously get that Bloody Mary.  It's a meal in itself.  And the chicken and waffles.... there's bacon in those waffles.  Inside of them.  It's a breakfast miracle!  Review 2: 1 star... service. Can I even give service a star when it doesn't even exists at this place?  I image their training manual reads something the the effect of \"screw it, I'm drunk\".  Now here's your block t-shit, get out there kid!  I honestly do not know how my order is ever taken, and how the heck my food ever makes it to the table,  I believe the kitchen staff must have excellent hearing and have devised a way to cut the floor staff out of the process all together because anything these guys touch goes to crap.  Did you want another beverage?  Well, assuming you ever get the first one, too bad!  You will never see that server again! Someone else will drop off your food and run away from the table.  What's that? only half of your table got their food? Here's the check!

We had to chase down the hosted who then reminded the waiter about our table. 20 minutes after arriving, he shows up with a lame excuse about not knowing we were in his section although he took every order to our left and right.   Then while waiting for our food, a major fight broke out in the kitchen. I'm not just talking punches, the table closest to the kitchen said someone got cut. A horde of security guards arrived and yellow-taped everything in the kitchen. Then they escorted the bus-boy out. The same guy that had bussed the table to our left (did I mention that they had arrived AFTER us!)  After the free show, our food arrived; one plate at a time. The waiter insisted the kitchen was delayed after the fight and judging from the yellow tape we gave them the benefit of the doubt.   Then my salad came with bacon, which wasn't on their menu description and to which I have an unfortunate allergy for. So, I had to wait some more for a fresh salad. However, when it arrived, it was amazing. The biscuit melted in your mouth, the salad was crispy and fresh. At our table, we had a couple of dishes. The fried chicken was amazing, the waffles and French toast were favorites, and the ingredients in everything were very fresh. Come hungry though, the portions are NO JOKE!  We were annoyed with the service (they get minus stars; below 0) but the food was top-notch (5+). So average it out to a 2 star experience. Would we come again? I don't know.... maybe we would order out... But might just avoid them all together, at least for a while.   PS you can get you $5 in parking back if you validate with your receipt.

I asked her for a suggestion, took one of her recommendations, and it did not disappoint. My daughter wanted a fancy schmancy ginormous hot cocoa and she suggested the smaller kids version which was the exact same. Yes please!!! Food came out piping hot and she didn't over stay her welcome but came around just enough times to help. It's like she had this intuition to serve. Love it! Note: portion sizes are ridonculous.

Next I ask for some extra syrup. They only give you your tiny bit with your order...  I end up waiting maybe 5 minutes and REBECCA brings me a side of butter. When I asked for syrup????  She apologizes and said she will bring me more syrup.   So I wait and wait. I watch her bring out water and food to other tables. Continue to wait. Keep in mind I'm not eating food. I'm waiting for my syrup...  REBECCA DROPS THE CHECK... MEANWHILE THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD ON THE TABLE BECAUSE I DID NOT GET SYRUP!!  So disrespectful. I ended up asking someone else for syrup and eating my cold french toast. They're lucky I didn't leave without paying. I hope she didn't expect a tip",

Service  Everyone was very friendly  and eager to answer any questions we had on the menu.   Restrooms  Since this restaurant is inside of the casino you must use the casino restrooms when you exit will be on your left hand side next to subway   Decor Restaurants is decorated like a barn you can see pictures of farm animals and will find barley on your table   Drinks I was amazed at the grand selection of drinks they have a lot of great alcoholic drinks and non alcoholic drinks from chocolate smores not chocolate to bloody Maury pay 15 bucks and you get to keep a neat hashtogogo cup  Food Get ready to share the portions here are huge. They still manage to decorate the plate with the huge portions. Everything was delicious. I went with a group of friends we all ordered plates to share we ordered following chicken and waffles  Snickers pancake French toast  Chicken Benedict  Roasted chicken   Everything was delicious my husband was not to found of the roasted chicken since this plate was healthier than all of the other options we ordered.

All the components were stacked on top of each other. The price was $16.99.   I gotta admit, the fried chicken was good. As good as some fried chicken places in LA. So there isn't a really huge surprise. And the fact that cooking fried chicken at home tastes as good... doesn't really justify the reputation this restaurant holds. After the delicious fried chicken, the rest of the story was bland. Mashed potatoes were worse than most places, especially a dish holding a $17 head. Similar to the raw spinach, the raw tomatoes were both bland and lazy. And the tomatoes were especially hard. The bacon was over cooked and old, and added a horrible texture to the dish.   The large size of this chain restaurant may be contributing to their descending taste. All in all, I would rather hit the other well-known eateries (Nacho Daddy, Freedom Beat, Pig Gastropub, etc) rather than starting your day with a large, unappetizing brunch.",

She also told us that the dishes were big enough to feed two people at least. We didn't listen and still ordered separate entree and had a lot of leftover's. It's right off of Fremont Street so it is local to everything. I absolutely loved it and one hundred percent recommend it to everyone.",

    "text": "Known for their large portions of breakfast foods (courtesy of Man vs Food), we came here to fill our bellies with 'cakes and bacon. One can always walk it off with a stroll along Fremont.  The bonus here wasn't the fact that the prices are very decent or that the cakes were bigger than our platter but that here, they use fresh ingredients.....and a lot of them.  The Tractor Driver Combo was served with fresh fruit, the cake had huge blueberries (and not the frozen with syrup kind) and two eggs cooked perfectly.  The service was a-ok, oj fresh squeezed and the bar area (where we sat) was kept very clean and orderly.    Bar is open seating.  If a table is preferred, plan at least a 15min wait as this place is popular.    5 stars for the music (Skid Row and The Scorpions for breakfast?!?!) and service,  4 stars as the potatoes were too \"soft\" (requested crispy).",

Shame on me for forgetting our server's name, but he was awesome (update: It was JACK! Jack is awesome). I'd only been to Hash House about a million times in San Diego, so wasn't sure this location would live up to what I remember. It was the same, but different. And it was awesome.  There was no skipping a beat on our orders and all of the \"no onions, dressing on the side, skip the such and such...\" type requests.   I had the Margie's Famous Crab Cake Benedict - a blue crab cake on top of a HUGE biscuit, mashed potatoes, sliced tomato, fresh spinach, minus eggs, sub avocado and asparagus all topped with a jalapeno cream sauce. IT WAS HUGE (as is everything at Hash House).  Everyone else was super happy with their food, too. We had a contest going on and if you were there, you will remember us all placing bets on our tiny co-worker to finish the chicken and waffles plate. She did it! The whole restaurant was cheering her on and letting her know they want to be her when they grow up. It was one of those nights your face hurts from smiling and laughing so much.   We finished with two Snickers Bread Puddings and a rendition of Happy Birthday then hit the casino.   A big thumbs up to them for taking care of us and enabling our shenanigans. Round two next month!   Hint: It's inside the Plaza Hotel on Fremont",

I ordered an egg white scramble with fruit. The serving of eggs was small and tasteless. I don't think they used salt or pepper even. The fruit was mostly frozen fruit and just mush. The melon wasn't ripe and the banana was completely green. Eggs and fruit should be the easiest meal but somehow they couldn't even do this right. I didn't even finish my plate and ended up getting a snack somewhere else after we left.   What a waste of time and money.",

I decided to try their Sage Chicken & Waffles and while it was delicious, it was far too much. It consisted of two decent pieces of chicken and four waffles and I would've preferred if they made one in half the size (i.e. one chicken and two waffles). As someone who also loves Nashville Hot Chicken, it was nice to know I had that option but I didn't try it. My breakfast could've fed two to three, maybe four people, which means for me, it was overwhelming. Tasty, but too much for me. I will come back and try a hash or a meat loaf breakfast.",

Thankfully Bar is \"FCFS\" so my friend & I got lucky right away. I ordered the chicken & waffle and it was delicious but way more than my petite stomach can hold. Food came quick and service was good at the bar. I observed the waiting list moved fairly quickly so don't be discouraged by the line.  So this is a great place to share meals: chicken & waffle was 2 fried chicken breasts + 4 waffles so you can definitely share.  Enjoy!",

The chicken and waffles look a lot better than they taste. It may have been a lack of syrup, but the waffles were dry. The chicken was good, but had a few small bones, which was unexpected. It was way more food than I could finish, very filling. I finished a little over half the meal.   The service was great and our waitress was very attentive.  Overall, not sure I will return.",

We all waited, we were right after that group, the hostess disappeared and only to reappear to tell us at 943pm that \"we seated the last guest at 940 pm\" . Really? You turn away paying and starving clients?! then to make matters worst??! she had no idea about the restaurant's coffee -- which was the reason I actually graced this hotel in the first place -- I was told that this particular location for this restaurant sold the coffee beans. NOT!! The hostess was totally clueless and kept disappearing to find someone with answers. Yeah don't go here unless you want to be disappointed or ignored. Oh and to put that point on that exclamation mark of a scenario ... 22 mins of walking around the casino hotel to get to this place, we left since we were \"turned away\" and had to pay $10 for parking??!! Unbelievable!!! Stick to the HH location in LINQ where service -- welcoming and courteous staff --  is awesome. At least, paying $9 for parking after eating a great meal and staying for about 2 hours was worth it at the HH location over at LINQ.  \"One star\" was given only because a \"no star\" review wouldn't allow me to post my review!!",

    "text": "Others in my party wanted to go here, and I had heard mostly positive things about it, so I didn't object.  If you like big breakfast and don't mind paying $15 to $25 per person for it, this place will make you very happy.  Service was good, food was good.  So why only 2 stars?  It's not you, it's me.  Personally, I'm not really into going out for breakfast, and when I do, I often get non-breakfast food and I'd rather go someplace inexpensive. When I splash this kind of cabbage around a restaurant, it's because I am getting dinner, and when I eat this quantity of food before 6pm I feel like crap for the rest of the day.  For these reasons, this place wasn't for me.  There are plenty of affordable breakfast options within a 2 block radius of 1 Main Street.    The cheapest thing I found on the menu with any amount of protein - and by any I don't mean very much - was the bacon waffle at about $9.  It was good for what it was, but I wasn't really into it.  With coffee, tax, and tip that's like $14 for breakfast, for something I wouldn't otherwise have ordered.  I didn't see anything else I wanted for under $10, which is my hard breakfast limit.  Others in my party seemed very satisfied with their monstrous plates of chorizo and eggs, etc.  and their bacon bloody maries.  Some of them got a waffle on the side as well.  Rolling in coffee, cocktails, tax, and tip, I think most of them were spending around $25 to 35 each by the time they walked out of there.  Next time, I'll opt for the Cafe Cortez coffee shop or the Main Street Station buffet.",

One order can feed two people.  They do have a late nite menu but the portions are slightly smaller  The reason for the 3 stars was the lack of service.  Although the food tasted great the wait time between the first order and last was at least 30 minutes and we all ordered at the same time.  Some orders did not have fruit even though on the menu it clearly states that it's supposed to have it.  Was told by the waiter that on that particular order does not come with it.  After requesting for a refill on water our waiter passed by our table 4 times avoiding eye contact until he came by with the pitcher of water.  I'm not sure how good the service is on breakfast but the service for a Saturday night was pretty bad.",

When we asked about something on the menu she knew exactly what was in the item in question, with no hesitation wish we came across more servers like her.  My husband ordered corn beef on a bed of potatoes that was a HUGE serving and he said it was delicious. Only complaint he had was that they didn't have any hot sauce, but by the way he almost liked his plate clean I doubt it was that big of an issue.   I wasn't very hungry so ordered The Tractor Driver Combo  (2 Eggs, Bacon and 1 flapjack)...should have known by the name it was going to be a big serving.  The pancake was so big I only ate half.  Was very clean and service was great, and the food was delicious.",

    "text": "THE. WORST. SERVICE. AND. SERVER. EVER!  IF YOU EXPECT TO PAY FOR GREAT FOOD PLUS SERVICE...  THIS LOCATION IS NOT THE ONE TO EAT AT!  I'll start off by saying the food is GREAT!  HOWEVER, the sole reason for the 1 star is for the service, or should I say the lack of service!   Let me start by summarizing the volume of business that I witnessed, since one may be quick to assume that it was busy.  -Upon arrival and walking to our table in the back of the restaurant, there were only a total of 4 tables sat up front and in our section, 2 more tables finishing up.  -Once we were seated, it took our server over 10 minutes to greet us just for our drink orders.   -Once we were ready to order, I bring it to our server's attention, and my exact words \"my son is allergic to shellfish, can you please note that when putting in our order\".  Instead of agreeing, our server, REBECCA, decides to ask numerous questions and give us a hard time about it! -After I order is placed, we do not see Rebecca again, until after our food was delivered by members of management! -It takes 45 minutes to get our food delivered to the table.  Our order: 2 chicken benny's, a ranchero benny, a regular breakfast platter, a chicken salad, and kid pancake combo. -Not only did it take our food forever to come out, but our food was delivered in increments of every 5 minutes.  Whatever happened to serving an entire table all at once?!?!  -I had to ask the manager serving our to look for our server so I can place an alcohol order.  He complies, instead of offering to take my order for me. Once I finally ordered my drink, I take notice that she IMMEDIATELY, NOT STEP TO THE BACK TO PUT MY DRINK ORDER, but IMMEDIATELY goes to a table next to us where her other co-workers are eating. IN THE CUSTOMER DINING AREA, and proceeds to EAT with them, instead of putting in my drink order first!  After five minutes of eating, Rebecca, our server, takes notice that I am looking at her, and she steps to the side, to which I believe to place my drink order, and then comes over to us stating \"I'm still waiting on your drink order, I don't know what is taking so long\", after I had witnessed her go straight to the \"employee lunch table\" first.   -My wife asks for something very minimal- extra napkins...  Rebecca, our server, does not come back with napkins after 5 minutes.  Instead we had to get up and \"interrupt\" the other servers eating and ask for napkins.   -My question is: since when do servers eat in the customer dining area as a group?  Every restaurant I've worked at or managed has a specific dining area for the employees!  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE!!!  I apologize, but did I mention at least the food was good?  Too bad the service negates the quality of the food they serve.",

I went with the Machacas and my husband the Chicken skillet. Our food came out within 10-15 minutes (can't be sure, we were too busy trying to plan a fun day) and was plated beautifully! My Machacas had skillfully prepared eggs with beef and tomatoes and onions...I had no idea eggs could be that fluffy! Fried potatoes and a large tortilla complemented my meal. I received the jalapeno sauce/salsa on the side and requested a side of limes to help cool it down. Delicious!!! I ate almost every bite of the eggs despite the gargantuan portion! Even though the potatoes were crispy and flavorful I couldn't even...my husband's skillet came with a soft and succulent biscuit the size of a softball and was paired with homemade jam, mixed berry possibly? His response? Perfectly warmed and moist ;) Yum!! His chicken skillet was chock full of onion, pepper, and asparagus served over the top of crispy fried potatoes, along side of two eggs done just right. Cleaned his enormously portioned skillet/plate! Bottom line, go early, realize that great restaurants become busy, and the food tastes farm to table fresh! Great coupons if you stay at the Plaza, but even without, very affordable restaurant experience! Thank you Hash House!",

I anticipated the sandwich would be more than she could finish, so the appetizer was the right choice.  Meatloaf was tasty, as was the appetizer I ordered.  Had we ordered full entrees, there would have been way too much food (keep that in mind when ordering).  The prices were a little steeper than I wanted (I was looking for a trendy-dinner experience, yet prices were closer to $20+ a plate), but I attribute that to the portion sizes they provide.  Service was ok.  Our waiter hung out behind the bar talking to one of his colleagues a bit more than I would've liked (i.e. we could've used refills on a couple of occasions when he was chatting), but it wasn't overly intrusive.  I'd give this place a 3, but my wife would give it a 4, so I'm rounding up for her.",

I wondered how I was supposed to eat it all! Luckily, my kiddo and I had agreed to share a plate.   The shake was presented beautifully and full of all the creamy, fatty goodness you would expect. The pancake was very large with bits of Snickers throughout. The sausages were flavored well and balanced out the sweetness of the pancake. The eggs were hearty to round things out.   Overall, I was completely full when I left.",

As far as we could tell, it's like some hipsters took over Denny's and added an interesting beer list.  I had the meatloaf, and regret to say I couldn't finish it. It was the best meatloaf I've had, but enough to feed a little-league team. I did crafts with the rosemary spear and spaghetti pieces as an added bonus. The side veggies--carrots & green beans were tasty and well cooked. The meatloaf sits on top of pan-fried mashed potatoes and is smothered in gravy. I loved it.  The other dish was the sage/bacon chicken & waffles. Also too much for one; it arrived with ample, moist (\"real\") fried chicken, bacon in the waffles and a few strands of green onions. The chicken & bacon were finished, but a waffle or two didn't fit. Judged: very good.  Be careful what and how much you order. The mains are splittable from what we saw.  Great beer list with several varieties rated 90%+ on the beer sites. The soundtrack on the house system even played the Pixies and other 90s indie rock.  We're planning to go back for breakfast.",

Would you let a child eat a NOT ripe banana? Come on! The \"chicken pot pie\" the chicken is actually turkey! I asked to then speak to the manager where he told me \" that's how the bananas are there fine\" and for you guys I shall upload the pictures.

You get three huge slices and can get items on the side if you want. I got the bacon, avocado, onion, and Swiss farm scrambler. It was super good! Biscuit looked awesome! I wasn't too impressed by the fried potatoes - they weren't very crispy and I didn't end up eating many. My friend got the meatloaf hash and really liked it. She could only eat about half of it. A couple people who are Bloody Mary connoisseurs got the BLT Mary and were impressed - and these people have Bloody Marys every weekend, so they must have been great. The most amazing thing was the Andy's Save Fried Chicken Benedict. Oh. My. God. It was on man vs food. This thing could easily serve four people. It was so damn good too! The fried chicken was perfect and had a good spice to it. The combination of everything was on point. I have literally thought about it each day since trying it.

They play nice music the only thing I didn't like was the waiting room a big mess and very little seats for people to wait but overall a great restaurant.

    "text": "When a coworker of mine heard that I would be going to Las Vegas, they told me about this place right away, and after hearing them rave about the food, I definitely had to check it out. This location is the one in downtown Las Vegas near Fremont Street, and it is also located next to a casino. We were seated pretty quickly and had great service throughout. The menu is nothing short of overwhelming with all of the great dishes that they had to serve. Once we made up our mind, we ordered and even our server advised us that we may have been ordering too much food. He was absolutely correct. Their portions are HUGE and even sharing one order of the French toast between 4 people was barely enough. My group and I had the chicken and waffles, one of the benedicts, the tractor driver combo, and the French toast. It was easy to see that we would have a lot of left overs. The food itself was very tasty once you got over the fact that everything as huge. The food definitely had a lot of flavors even though the presentation seems a little rushed. It is definitely a great place to have a bite to eat and just a heads up: you may need to call someone to cart you out of there once you're finished.",

    "text": "Been here twice now, but needed the second trip to make sure I wrote an appropriate review. Before ordering here please be aware that this place serves HUGE HUGE portions. I didn't even come close to finishing my plate and I have  pretty big appetite. Prepare to split or share food because they won't do a half order.  We stayed at the Golden Nugget in Downtown Vegas so Hash House a Go Go was an easy 5 minute walk. Not 100% sure what the parking situation is here, but most hotels have Valet, and I think they have there own lot somewhere down the street.   On this trip I order the Sage Fried Chicken. Again, huge portion. The sage really came through on the chicken and the sauce was amazing. The chicken was fried, with a great crisp on the outside, but not greasy. It was placed on a bed of egg and bacon, which was followed by an enormous pile of hash potatoes, on top of two home made biscuits. The potatoes are great but there is way too much of them, and the biscuits are fantastic. Unfortunately the biscuits are stuck under the pile of potatoes so in order to eat them with the chicken you have to rescue them from the bottom of the plate.   My Fiancee ordered the French Toast. One order comes with three huge pieces of French Toast topped with a caramelized banana and pecans. She ate one and a half pieces of French Toast before calling it quits. Overall she loved it and would order it again after trying a few more things first.   I found the menu hard to read because it was wayyyy too cluttered. Also, we were there on a Wednesday at 11am with basically no body in the restaurant and the service was kinda spotty. We got seated right away but it took a while for someone to get a coffee order. We then had to get a busser to ask our waitress for a refill. We also needed some extra plates and had to ask the host to find our waitress for that as well.",

    "text": "I was excited to come here as I am a huge breakfast food and Bloody Mary fan and saw all the food pictures and the raving reviews. And, my friends and I came here after a long night of partying and we were hungry so you know everything automatically tastes better. We could not have been more disappointed down this road of food mediocrity.  This review not reflective of our servers or front host, they were attentive, friendly, and did a good job. A couple of us were first served the BLT Bloody Mary, it was served with a half slice of bread and mayo...why? I don't think anyone was going to make a sandwich with a half slice of bread with the bacon and tomato and if we did, at least have it toasted. Perhaps the bread is for dipping? Again toasted would keep it from getting too soggy. The Bloody Mary itself was lacking in spice and had little depth of flavor, it was more like plain V-8 juice. At least it had bacon?  Speaking of bacon, we ordered a side of it to share because we knew whatever came with the drink could never be enough; because bacon, that's why.  It was a thicker type cut and on the slightly saltier side which was fine to go with the bland drink but not on its own. We left some bacon behind...nooooooo, this little piggy went to the trash.   Two of my friends had the rosemary roasted chicken hash with asparagus. They stated it tasted more like pulled rotisserie chicken with a few underwhelming spices thrown mixed in. Some of the asparagus pieces were fibrous. The \"crispy\" potatoes weren't crispy any longer and seemed like they had been sitting out ready to be used instead of being made to order. Definitely not what they were expecting.  I had a similar experience with my \"healthier\" mushroom, artichoke, and sun-dried tomato hash except my was served luke warm and my crispy potatoes were over cooked and downright soggy from the veggies. The veggies didn't mesh and seemed like they were all prepared separately them thrown on top and made to sit there until all my fellow cohorts' food was also ready. The eggs that came with it were made well from the over easy to sunny side up. The fruit was sweet and fresh. Sadly, the best part was the biscuit, I enjoyed it with the jam (not sure if it was homemade but it was good) and my friends liked it with the  gravy. The issue was half of all of our biscuits were starting to sog up from being in the bottom of the skillet and next to the fruit. The top half of the biscuit was light and buttery and very enjoyable. It would be better to serve it separately or on top of the hash.  We were all sad the hash from the was the worst of what was ordered from the Hash House hence the 2 versus 3 star rating.    My other friend had the pancake with a side of ham. Did I say pancake? I meant GIANT pancake. This thing was large enough to soak up all 6 of our alcohol poisonings from the night prior. For being so large I was impressed that it had some good volume rise to it and evenly cooked. It was a little more cooked than I generally like my pancakes, but that's completely understandable given it's huge size.  It also went very well with that jam I spoke of earlier. This dish is not for the diabetic. Well done hash house.   The corned beef hash sandwich with caramelized onions was handsomely sized and filling and the fries that came with it were meaty and good. The rye bread was a little too thickly cut and some of it was left behind. My friend stated the flavors were decent overall.",

We also a portobello mushroom sandwich with peppers, pesto, and goat cheese.  Both were terrific.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated, served, or to get the check, which was welcome, since our reason for being at the Plaza was to see The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

    "text": "After picking up my bib packet for Saturday mornings 9/11 Remembrance Run 9./11 K race I am running, the lady & decided to grab some mid afternoon lunch. Being in the eclectic people watching mecca of the west (also known as Fremont Street in Las Vegas) we settled on checking out the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel, and our first foray into the quirky \"Hash House a Go Go\" which just opened recently.  After getting welcomed and seated we both decided to feast on this big, bad sandwich:  \"INDIANA FAVORITES  Big O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich With onion, pickles & of course ketchup on a whole wheat bun served with your choice of side. You'll think you're back in Indiana!\"  So when Tommy our server came to take the order, we rolled with it.  Except I made a fatal food service customer error.  I asked if I could have some *lettuce* added to the above.  See, as a former Hoosier, I grew up with pork tenderloin sandwiches. The staple of VFW Post lunches, greasy all night diners, and fairs & festivals. Except, as the HH description notes, it is not served with the 'traditional' IN combination of lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Understanding this, I figured I would compromise, and make just a minor deviation.  \"Can I get lettuce added to mine also please?\", I asked.  *pause*  Tommy: \"you want lettuce on yours also. Uh, well, I can add it, except it would come as a side, so it will come as a \"side item\", and its an additional upcharge for $2.00. Did you want me to do that?\"  Me: (silence while mentally calculating how two leafs of iceberg lettuce retails out to $2.00 in food service). \"Um, no that's okay, I can't justify that\".  Good thing I didn't ask for tomato and/or mayo then.  The meal came out and as described, the hammered tenderloin was HUGE. Mind you, this is how it is depicted.  Mine appeared a bit differently: Less fanfare in the presentation. Which was still okay. With no pickle. The thing is HUGE. And wasn't too bad taste wise.  Tommy was a great server. Brought a refill of drink out before less than 1/4 remaining- always a gold standard. Pronounced my last name on debit card spot on, which can be difficult.   Tommy also said \"I checked with the manager about the lettuce and she said that they could not do it without charging extra... which I don't agree with personally\".  So all in all, this particular server is on top of his game. The food was decent, yet not remarkable. And my bill for the sandwiches, soda, lemonade and the fries? A staggering $39.00 for lunch with no adult beverages.  That's right. Kind of a pricey lunch for what you get, however I guess the portion size makes up for it.  With that said, the fact that you cannot make a simple addition like iceberg lettuce is the reason I will not go back to HH in Las Vegas. I can buy an entire head of lettuce for about 99 cents. I understand restaurants making profit, and certainly addition or substitutions can cost more. 50 cents extra? no problem, I guess. I come from an area where tomato is a seasonal item and can actually cost more off season (i.e. 'deluxe' on a burger). I guess for the same price I should have ordered the hamburger which comes 'deluxe' instead.  My point to the review/rant is that customers in restaurants often do need to make substitutions or changes out of dietary concerns, and I get that. However the server discussing it with the manager and her standing firm on that kind of a request for such a simple item is a bit out of line. I can get lettuce on by $1.29 BK double cheeseburger for nothing, because it is an inexpensive item. An upscale restaurant needs to have *some* flexibility to its policy on adding \"vegetables\" as a side item. Had I ordered a \"side of lettuce\", then I would expect to be charged more for it because that is known as a salad. I should have asked to trade for the pickle I never got on the sandwich instead and called it even.  I don't make a policy out of speaking to managers. The last time I did so (calmly and as we left) it led to a fight in the relationship, and I don't need that hassle either. So what is one to do?  Vote with my money.  And that is why I will not be back to Hash House A Go Go.",

It took 30 minutes before our food came out.  I shared my concerns with the on-duty manager, and he did nothing to apologize; he made excuses for her and the lack of service we experienced.  I am making it known today that HHAGG is just that - hashed and gone.  We won't be back, and I'm sharing with others to don't even bother to go here.  One star is too many!",

We were seated, looking through the menu you could tell this was not the place to go if you are counting calories because the portions are generous.   I ordered the Vanilla Waffles with a side bacon. As I suspected, the portions are big and delicious, so this was going to be one of those meals you can't finish, but leftovers are fine by me anyway.  I enjoyed this place, and could see myself coming back here at some point",

I've seen big flapjacks before, but this one took the (pan)cake. It was not only large in diameter, but thick throughout. We ordered the blueberry flapjack and it overflowed the plate. As big as it was, it did not lack in taste. I especially loved the crispy outside which added a nice texture. Only thing I would have appreciated, considering the size, was two syrups.  We also ordered the Chorizo hash and it was okay. I think the best thing about the dish was the massive biscuit. Would have been nice to have had some jam.  Overall, the food was acceptable. But as for the experience, I prefer to dine without inhaling smoke fumes. I guess that's inherent to dining in a casino, but if you have the option to dine at another location, take it.",

The portions are enormous, but I'll admit the flavors let me down a little. Everything was good, but I had really expected something really memorable. I had the Meatloaf Hash, which I couldn't finish - and that doesn't happen often! - I would have liked a richer flavor in the Meatloaf, but it was still good, which chunks of Potatoes, Onion, Pepper, and topped with a Sunny-Side-Up Egg (my choice) it made for a heavy breakfast. I also couldn't resist trying the BLT Bloody Mary. I don't like Bloody Marys, and I didn't particularly like this one, but it had plenty of kick, and a full Leaf of Lettuce, slice of Tomato, and thick slice of Bacon. Not a cheap beverage, but when am I ever going to have the chance for one of those again!? I still think it's a \"bucket list\" restaurant, but don't over-hype your expectations, and you'll be fine.",

The service was three stars. As in many Las Vegas eateries, they just don't seem to pay that much attention to customers.  Th kicker, though, was the parking. You pay $5 for the Plaza self-park as you enter the lot. Then you get your ticket validated by your food server, who tells you to take it to the booth for a refund of your parking fees. There are no further instructions - or signs - telling you that it isn't the parking lot booth where you paid. No, it's the cashier booth in the casino. So that's three stops to get your parking fee returned. Oh, and the parking lot is about a hundred yards from the hotel - past the Greyhound station.",

It's eggs and meat and bread and starches. Every lovely food group that I've ever loved all on one plate.  I had the corned beef house hash. It was by far one of the greatest meals ever and an unexpected breakfast dish. It had a huge portion of corned beef topped with some Swiss cheese.  I've never been a Swiss fan as I think the aftertaste of it is quite outputting, but with the saltiness of the beef, the cheese worked well and was mighty tasty. There was also a huge helping of potatoes, your choice of two eggs, and a biscuit. All in all, it was enough for two meals for me. I'm one of those people that usually can't finish a normal sized portion, let alone a breakfast big enough for a caveman BUT since there wasn't a fridge in the room, I forced myself to eat it all and walk around with my pants un-buttoned for the day.  The prices are a bit steep in comparison to other breakfast joints. Our breakfast cost around $40 for two entrees, a coffee and a fresh squeezed orange juice. In the future, I'd get an entree to split and that would help with the cost and the super sized portions.",

As we were looking over what to order and who was going to spilt what we noticed the people behind us had Mac n cheese (which was not on the menu). If our waitress had explained that there was a happy hour menu we would have known. She came and got our drinks and food orders and told us we couldn't move seats. I guess they do their check ringing by seats. About 20 mins pass and still no drinks. Drinks finally arrive followed by our apps and food. Nearly all at the same time.  I ordered the BBBlt with salad. Salad was great. But I've never had croutons that were soggy in the middle. Outer portion was crunchy but inside was gross! Cut into my BBBlt and there is a hair attached to one if the tomatoes. I sent the plate back and the waitress asks if I want a replacement. On the other side of the table a meal was dead cold. The waitress sends it back to the kitchen.  We all finally get our food back and enjoy as best we could.  Side note: ranch is .95 per container!   Checks arrive. My meal was not comped. When I asked the waitress she said that they do not comp meals since I asked for a replacement. Wtf!   We went round and round. After getting the manager involved the meal was finally removed. But the waitress kept coming over to tell me why she couldn't comp it! She said I was committing fraud since I requested a replacement sand which.   All in all...we won't be back and if you hair in your food...well you are paying for a replacement sand which.",

Great for breakfast, and probably great for lunch and dinner.  Husband had the sated fried chicken and waffles.

If you are lucky enough to get them they are big and juicy stacked on top of a big chunk of watermelon.  They also come with a delicious sauce.  The quesadilla is huge, I can't believe they found a plate to fit it on!  Not your typical quesadilla, it comes on a bed of mashed potatoes.  If you have a car or are staying downtown try out this location.  There is not a huge wait like the one on the strip always has.  If you want to experience the full menu come between breakfast and dinner.  The menu late at night is limited although still good.",

I had the sundried tomato/goats cheese/basil scramble which tasted great and fresh, and came with a side of potatoes and a biscuit. The size of the meal actually wasn't huge, which I actually prefer as the size of meals in the US can be a little scary for a foreigner!  I saw the flapjacks on another table, they were MASSIVE and didn't look overly appetising. I think the hashes and scrambles are the way to go here.  Service was good and attentive.",

Could it be that he doesn't like you? Could it be that when you walked in with your girlfriend, who happens to be Caucasian, and you are brown that he didn't like that? It feels like it. Other tables received water. Tables around you that were seated AFTER you. The table NEXT to you got  a beverage. But your table didn't get WATER. He came twice. Once to ask if you wanted drinks. The second to take the order. Yes, we wanted water both times. Did we have to get up and try to flag you down? No!! You passed us numerous times. Didn't even look our direction. In this day and age, you shouldn't have to worry about being denied service because of your ethnicity, skin tone, or anything else for that matter. This sure feels like it. It's sad.   Sad. I reached out to corporate. Wrote them basically the same thing. No response. Wouldn't you want to address this? Seems that this establishment needs some work on customer relations.

I always get the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($18) which is basically fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was really crispy and good...just wished it had more flavor. The waffles were not fluffy at all. They seem to break apart quite easily. And they were crumbly when you cut them into pieces. The waffles weren't soft and smooth. Other than that, I really enjoy their breakfast selections here.",

We were in Vegas again and decided to have brunch at the hash house because our previous experience was a great one. This wasn't the case this time around. The service was absolutely horrendous. I think the server kept forgetting items (5-6 times) and chalking it up to \"they're working on it now.\" From when we finally received the bill to when we walked out was 32 minutes. No bueno.   Overall the food remains to be pretty decent, but unless I have a random 2 hours to kill, we probably won't be back, at least to the Linq location. One and a half thumbs down... happy eating!",

We got seated right away, and as I walked to my table I looked at other dinners food and wow, the portions were HUGE! LIKE everything was baby size HUGE. Kind of intimidating. The decor was cute, I liked it. I ended up ordering the basic breakfast, which comes with eggs, sussage, crispy potatoes, fruit and biscuit. I ordered that because I did not want a huge portion. And I was right to order it because though it was a medium size breakfast I hardly finished it. The eggs a were good, the biscuit was very delicious and moist and I loved loved the sussage! It was so juicy and flavourful, the potatoes were really good too. Overall I enjoyed my food. Def give this place a try.   Make sure you share you plate because it serves at least 2-3 people.",

It was breakfast time so not very busy. As I walked to my booth I noticed how large the portions were. Especially the pancakes. Wow. Like 12-14\". I had heard so much about the Chicken n waffles that my mind was pretty much made up before I sat down. I did take the time to look over the menu. Lots of variety and definitely plan on a return trip to sample other items. The Chicken n waffles come out and boy what a plate of food. The couple across the way looked and started to laugh at how large the portion was. Easily could share with a 2nd persons and maybe even a 3rd. Chicken was seasoned and breaded perfectly. The four waffles infused with bacon were like desert. Salty with a little bit of sweet. I was only able to eat one piece of chicken and one waffle. So that means one piece of chicken and three waffles made it to the airport to finish on the plane. Much better than peanuts and Fritos.",

And even though it was right on a holiday when we went for lunch with my boyfriend and the coupons are not valid on holidays, our waiter talked to the manager and they made an exception! I loved our experience here from the minute we stepped through the door. Be prepared to wait a little during lunch time, but the wait went by pretty quickly for us. Our waiter was super nice, and kept checking back to make sure we had everything we needed. I had the BBBLT which was huge!! My sandwich was served on nice fluffy milk bread. For my drink, I really enjoyed Hash House's Mango Pineapple white wine spritzer. It was very refreshing on a hot day. My boyfriend enjoyed his downsized burger, which was just one patty of certified angus beef, and he was able to finish it. We will definitely be back to this exceptional place on our next trip to Vegas!!",

We didn't quite make it on the last trip, so this time I was determined.  Our first attempt to hit the restaurant failed miserably, as we attempted to eat at the location on the strip around lunchtime and the wait was well over an hour. A few days later, we stopped by the location inside the Plaza on Freemont and the wait was a reasonable 15 minutes. (As an aside, I love the system they have. As soon as you put your name down, you get a text saying you're in the system. And then when your table is ready, you get another text. It's amazing.)  Obviously, I just had to order a hash, so I went with the Corned Beef (\"Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese\"). It arrived pretty quickly and it was enormous. The tender meat was slathered in cheese and onions and was, of course, quite irresistible, while the two sunny-side-up eggs were cooked perfectly. The dish was also accompanied by a soft-baseball-sized biscuit and a cup of homemade peach jam. (That jam is amazing, by the way. It basically tastes like a peach pie in jam form.)  My only real complain here is that the food was not hot when it arrived to the table. It had clearly been sitting under a heating lamp for a few minutes and that's a shame.",

Way too much for one person to eat and you almost feel like you're wasting food. You, of course, can bag up the leftovers but if you're staying downtown what are the chances of you having a fridge or a microwave to warm it up. The bloody Mary's are to die for!",

I have been here a couple of times and it is definitely one of the better breakfast/brunch spots. My boyfriends and I were staying in LV with some of our friends and we were really hungry. I put our name down for 8 people and they quoted us 45 minutes. Honestly, totally expected for the time that we arrived. Luckily they ended up calling us  in 20 mins.  They ended up putting us at 2 separate booths of 4. We didn't request this, but I guess they were trying to accommodate us as quickly as possible. The server took a long time to come to us, but once she was at our table she was very nice and attentive. We ordered a round of mimosas and my boyfriend and I split a Ground Turkey Hash Brown entree that came with smoked bacon, onion and smoked mozzarella. It also comes with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs and served with fruit and a biscuit. Oh man, thank god we split this. It was WAY too much food. Both me and my boyfriend could not finish it, we even gave part of it to our friends because their food was actually a really small portion.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience and I would be back here again if we were in the area.",

She was not friendly at all. Ruined the experience a bit.   When the food came out, it was huge! Everything had potatoes, and a huge mound of them! Out of the 4 of us not a single person finished them. Felt bad for wasting all the food. Looking at everyone else's plates around the restaurant, theirs were full too, super wasteful :(   I also didn't get the colored spaghetti noodles sticking in everyone's food? I bit into one of them on accident, yuck!",

Then we went with friends, for dinner. One person ordered the meat loaf... it was enough for at least two hungry people. One person ordered the chicken pot pie (at which point the server asked \"Do you know how big that is!?)... actually it was enough for all four of us! My wife and I ordered a small side salad (to share), and a hamburger (to share).  The salad was just right, and the hamburger was enough for three people. I quickly came to the realization that a family of 4 (or 5 if the kids are small) could eat cheaper than at McDonald's... $14.99 for the chicken pot pie. I found the overall quality of food to be average, but the quantity enormous. One other thing... As a senior citizen, I have yet to buy in to what the younger people are doing to themselves.  A server in restaurant with tattoos and metal things sticking through noses, eyebrows, tongue, etc., is not an appetizing sight, in fact it's an appetite depressant.",

I don't get it but whatever, let's give it a try.

All of them have been five star experiences and I would have given this one the same except for the obnoxious odor proliferating through the casino hotel it is located. We valet parked and had to walk through the casino to get to Hash House. The only way I can describe it is that it smells like the worst, most overpowering, perfume that my 70 year old substitute teacher would wear back in the 3rd grade (and if I can remember that smell from 20 + years ago you know it was bad). You know the kind that would give you an instant migraine. That is not Hash House A Go Go's fault but the smell is there and makes it hard for this one to be as appetizing as the rest. The food was as good as usual, but ugh the smell. The food gets the four stars. If you want to try Hash House I would try one of their other locations, at least until they change the scent in the Plaza.",

From the second we sat down to the time we left, out experience was completely frustrating. When I asked if the chili sauce on the Crab Cake Benedict was spicy, he put his hands up and said \"I don't give my opinion, last time it back-fired\". I have never experienced that from a server and we asked if he could bring a side of the sauce to try. He seemed bothered by the request, but brought the sample. It was spicy! I ordered another item and asked for an Orange Juice and Coffee, but forgot both items. I finally got my coffee after I was done with the meal, but we had to leave since we had been there such a long time. The food wasn't anything special and the wait to get in was ridiculously long.",

I ordered biscuits and gravy, and my boyfriend ordered the hammered tenderloin pork sandwich. The portions are HUGE (I took a pic). I also ordered a mimosa and it was delish. It was good food, but nothing to boast about. Maybe I need to try something else but it can be overwhelming because it's a lot of food. It was worth the wait, and I would go back!",

They serve the banana hot in the French toast and it's still in its peel which is good actually bc the banana didn't get brown or slimy during cooking heat. The eggs has some brown spots from overcooking in my opinion and the French toast was a little soft and either needed more egg or more heat or both. All that being said it was still a great meal. And we had 25% off a food purchase of $25 or more and our food was under $20 but with non alcoholic drinks it was $35 and the waitress took our coupon which made me happy.  Ambiance is ok. Plaza is kinda eh and the restaurant feels fairly chain-like but overall a good time and good meal. Great coffee drinks but we paid for it $$ at $7 and $8 a pop.",

After seeing what was being brought out to other customers, my husband and I decided to split the Texas Ranchero and a side of fruit. We're both good eaters, and we got stuffed while still leaving easily 1/3rd of the order on the table. For one entree! The pancakes we saw being brought out were literally the size of a large pizza. It's so incredibly wasteful, both in terms of the amount of food that must be thrown out every day and that they're charging $16 for an entree that only a linebacker could attempt to finish. How about cutting it in half and charging $8 or $10?",

The service was awesome and the presentation of the food exciting, it is something you would see on Man vs Food. The portions are HUGE, enough to share with at least three people, if not more. I ordered the Benedict and it was easily a four people portion. I love a good eggs Benedict, but this dish was lacking and I could only eat a few bites. Pretty dry from the biscuits, to the chicken and bacon which was way over cooked. This place gets great reviews and has celebrity credibility, I'm sure it was just the fact we were there so late. The restaurant prides it's self in being \"farm fresh\". I'm going to tell you, it was not farm fresh quality and I wouldn't go back, nor recommend this diner joint.",

Not as impressive as a space upstairs that overlooks the Fremont Street Experience, but pretty good.  Also, you can get breakfast here anytime.  They will only serve the eggs scrambled after a certain time, even on a eggs benedict.  But still, if you want breakfast but didn't wake up until noon, its a good option.  Definitely try the chicken eggs benedict.  It comes over one of their fresh made biscuits. A little spicy and oh so yummy!  Yes, the portions are huge.  But guess what?  One person does not have to eat it all. To go boxes or sharing are both options.  And the best part?  Free wi-fi! Definitely a fan of that.",

It was pretty slow, it was a Tuesday night so there were only about 3 other tables occupied. We were seated quickly and our server came out right away.  The menu itself is not very big. For drinks we both decided on the mango iced tea. It was decent but I don't think I'd order it again. I decided to go with the bacon, avocado, cheddar burger, my three favorite ingredients combined, I couldn't resist. After asking for our more than helpful servers opinion, my husband decided to go with the kokomo. About 10-15 minutes later our orders came out, we were surprised to see the fairly large portions. My mouth was watering, longing to take that first bite. As soon as I sank my teeth into my burger I was let down. The burger was so bland, I couldn't taste any seasonings at all. It was a total let down, I couldn't eat half, I politely took the remainder of the burger home only to throw it away. The fries on the other hand were some of the best I've ever had.   I don't think I'll be stopping by again any time soon. Next time I think I'll try the breakfast to be on the safe side. We had great service and decent food minus the burger.",

As an example, a side of mashed potatoes comes in a hugh dish, chock full of bacon pieces and other stuff, with full slices of bacon on top, whole thing buried under cheese toupe.  Prices reasonable.  highly recommend.  Have bottled beer and fancy drinks.  I suggest they add beer on tap. Wish they would open places in Los Angeles area.  Would be a hit.",

    "text": "Think about splitting a plate. Orders are Huge.  Located inside of the Plaza hotel, this location is somewhat small. I can see how this place can easily get packed on a busy day. I even spied a rack of those waiting pagers restaurants give you along with a 45 minute wait time.  Luckily for us we were here on a Wednesday morning and we were immediately seated. My boyfriend & I ordered Andy's sage fried chicken wondering if it would be enough.   The dish was very attractive when it came to our table about 10 minutes later. Sage fried chicken with a maple reduction on top of bacon which was on top of mashed potatoes. There were 2 eggs and a biscuit on the side. It was served with jam & butter.  Everything was really tasty, but not to the point where we were thinking \"Woah, we need to come back here the next time we're in town!\". It was more like, \"Cool. I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it featured on that show. Not bad.\". Still, the price of one dish that could serve 2 people was not bad by Vegas standards.",

We were both craving a snack and a cocktail waitress recommended Hash House. Funky decor and vibe to match the clientele. Apparently, we were sitting in the booth where Neil Patrick Harris ate. I didn't see his autograph, but my wife tells me it was there.  We just wanted a snack of some kind. I was disappointed in the small dessert menu, but I followed my wife's lead and got the biscuit and added the gravy. My wife suddenly took ill from a long night and we had to change our order to go. The waitress was awesome and by the time I came around with the car, my wife had paid the tab and was waiting for me.   When I returned to our room, I had my food and have to say that it is my new standard for biscuits and gravy: not too much goo and just the right amount of savory sausage. The biscuit was light and fluffy and I went to bed happy. Kudos.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to give HHAGG yet another chance and this trip was the deciding factor I will never eat there again.   Service was HORRIBLE,  1. Waitress dragged her feet walking to the table, didn't even get greeted for at least 5 minutes, looked like she was still half asleep, didn't smile, NOO customer service at all.   2. Asked to start off with two waters, started to also ask for a Bloody Mary, she walked away before we could get the words out, even when we tried to grab her attention. (Fastest she moved all morning)   3. When she finally returned with waters I asked what types of vodkas she had, she didn't know, my date literally got up and walked to the bar to check it out, because waiting for her would have taken to long.    3. I asked for extra olives in my BLT Bloody Mary, was told no because there was no way to charge for it.... I didn't really think my request was to out of line but moving on.   4. Received my Bloody Mary, asked for worchestire sauce, she replied, ooo I don't know if I can get that.... Again... What?!?!?   5. Asked another server for worchestire sauce... Never came.   6. At one point the server said I'm sorry I worked until 1 last night and then was rescheduled at 8 this am. And while I understand that this situation sucks, I didn't make the schedule, or come to a place of business to receive slow, bad service. (She told all her tables this sob story)   7. My food came out cold. At this point I knew my date was already at wits end so I decided not to say anything else. But it wasn't even like sort of warm, it was cold.   8. When we mentioned our dissatisfaction to the manager he kind of seemed lost and confused. He did offer to comp two bloody Mary's (which we later had to have removed from the bill because our waitress charged us for them)   9. Our waitress never even came by to check if everything came out well after our food was delivered.   10. I unfortunately did not get the food runners name. But he was the ONLY part of this visit that was a positive experience, when he brought out the food he was happy energetic asked if we needed anything else, he also cleared our plates when we were finished. And I had asked him for the manager he actually came back to the table to tell me he notified the manager, and came back a second time to double check the manager came by. (With no disrespect, he was the African American food runner for the morning shift on 11/16/2013, he would make a great waiter)   Again, this was the last time I would eat at hash house, worst dining experience by far.",

Actually had the trifecta, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The trucker breakfast plate is amazing, including the pancake that is bigger than your head.  I had the Meatloaf sandwich and it was to die for.  The sides are are also crazy big and outrageous.  The mashed potatoes with bacon and cheddar could easily be a meal in itself.    After our 1st meal we did figure out that one entree could easily be split among 2 people (with room to spare).  When staying at the plaza the coupon book has a good deal in it.  There are also discounts available on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>.  After a couple hours of BJ I was also able to secure a comp meal for 3 here from the Pit Boss.  Don't miss it and don't believe the haters.  This place rocks!",

    "text": "So I just may have had too high of hopes for this one, but Hash House A Go Go at the Plaza hotel in downtown LV was just okay.  We went in for brunch at around 10AM and there was no wait for 6 people. Our server was quick and answered all of our questions about the menu. Before we knew it our order was in and food was on the table. The huge plus about this place, besides the fast service, was the portions. You can easily share an entree between two people (and probably still have leftovers). Unfortunately the food did not wow me as I had hoped it would.  Hearing so much about the sage fried chicken and waffles I didn't even need to look at the menu to know what I wanted. Maybe the cook was having an off day or maybe this location was not the right one to try, but what arrived was less than noteworthy. The sage gave the chicken breading a unique flavor unfortunately once I cut into the chicken (which I believe was a boned thigh) all of the breading fell off the chicken making it a big skin, syrup, mess with flavorless chicken. The waffles had strips of actual bacon in them which would have been pretty awesome if the bacon was cooked a bit more.  Nothing really memorable here and no raves from our group.  Next time I'm in Vegas I might go back, to try something else at a different location.  Pros: Quick and helpful service, huge portions, decently priced. Cons: The food.",

    "text": "Three Stars because:  1. The portions here are HUGE. Literally they can feed you for two meals.  2. My boyfriend and I got seated in the booth next to Barry Bond's and Neil Patrick Harris' photos. 3. No wait, we were seated right away - we went at noon 4. When I asked for a small plate, they gave me a nice huge serving plate 5. Food is pretty good and displayed nicely  Cons: 1. Parking sucks around here. We parked at Las Vegas Club and paid five dollars. But then again downtown Las Vegas doesn't have free parking.  2. The waitresses were really pushy. They were really just trying to get us to order and rushing us to leave. It was down time too. Almost no one was there. Rude in my opinion.  Okay. So I had trouble making up the list of Pros and Cons, but overall I give this place three stars. Would I go back? Not for a while, but I would if I had no where else to go. Maybe it's because we went to a not so popular Hash House A Go Go in Vegas.  My boyfriend and I ordered two dishes. At first we were originally getting just the Man vs. Food Favorite (Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict), but then we saw people order the burgers and had to try one so we ordered the Fresh Mushroom and Swiss 1lb Burger.  Fresh Mushroom and Swiss Burger: The burger was actually kind of small. I didn't get any sides with it, but overall I'd give it 3.5. I've had better burgers. This one was just blah. I guess what got me was mushrooms, I love eating mushrooms, but this burger barely had any in it. It consisted of two meat patties, barely any mushroom, and one slice of melted swiss cheese. And in the end it only tasted like a burger I could get at any fast food store.   Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: Overall it was good. The portion is humongous! My boyfriend and I could not finish it, but if you like CARBS, you'll enjoy this. It had bacon, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, biscuits, very little spinach, fried chicken, and some spicy sauce to finish. I have to say it was pretty good. It definitely had that spice to it! Overall I would give it 4. It's pretty unique, but you should eat it all. Don't eat leftovers of it, it sucks.   Tip: You should wear elastic waist pants because food portions are huge. You'll definitely feel it after eating a meal.",

    "text": "The waiter said that the sun-dried tomato & artichoke hash was his favorite vegetarian hash, it also happened to be the only. It was bland and pretty much all of the ingredients were tasteless. After asking how the food was and walking off before I could answer, I spent ~20 minutes trying to flag him back down to get something else. The replacement was an equally bland bacon-less version of the original benedict, which was doused in equally bland red pepper sauce, and had a mammoth (and dry) biscuit instead of an english muffin. The waiter happily took away my food when I said that I didn't like it much more than the first dish, but when the check came I was informed that 'his manager' had refused to let him take off two items from the check. When I told him that it was 'okay' and that I'll just never come back, he smiled and said 'sure'. $14 poorer and no less hungry, I left and plan, as I said, to never go back.",

I love the idea but the drink had a sweetness that (to me) comes from cheap tomato juice with corn syrup in it. One friend ordered the corned beef hash and it was out of this world. NO complaints there. Another friend and I split the Chicken and Waffles.  Large portions and no problems splitting.  (Hash and splitting is why I gave a 4, not a 3) When I eat C&W I like a combo of sweet and savory/salty. The chicken was tasty, but not really great fried chicken and the waffles had no sweetness as a contrast. We were underwhelmed. I would go again - and place a different order. Our service was quite good.",

Our waiter was a male, one of the persons in our party of 3 ordered a coffee and the waiter brought her out a cold coffee of old coffee to our table and told us that a new batch would be ready in 8 minutes, a half hour later we needed to track him down and ask him for the coffee. When we ordered our food I asked if could get sauteed onions on my hamburger our waiter replied I could ask the chef but he will not do it, we were all thinking are you kidding us your chef will not Saute onions for a burger, sounds like this chef needs another job to us.  We then were anticipating hot biscuits delivered to the table like last year, instead we each got a cold, old and very hard biscuits, no butter etc. delivered to the table to accompany them. This restaurant does not seem to feel the need to care anymore. Our food arrived, it was fair at best, and we did not see our waiter until he delivered our check. We were very disappointed that he did not bother to check in with and see how are food was or take the dishes off the table. I was tempted to bus the table myself. Based on our service and the attitude of the chef we will not be back.",

We wandered in the Plaza in search of the McDonalds, but since it was closed and we didn't think we'd make it much farther looking for food, we decided to stop in Hash House A Go Go.  Looking at the menu I thought the entrees looked a little pricey, but when we got our food I realized why.  The portions were gigantic.  Like some of the biggest I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  Which was awesome for my hangover.  I got this really incredible Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade that was both delicious and beatiful.  Our server was amazing.  She was so fun and really helped rally our tired hungover group.  She went out of her way to add litte touches that made our meal better.  One of the girls had a bloody mary that had food on tiny swords. After we broke one in a tiny sword fight, we asked for one more.  She brought enough for everyone in the group which was rather large.    I would definitely go back here next time I go to Fremont street.",

Personally, I would aim for excellence in food, environment, or something like the same, but HHAGG shoots for ridiculous portions that even the hungriest of Americans find it difficult to finish. (And boy are there some hungry ones out there!) The food is decent enough - better than your average chain restaurant. The decor is sleek. The service is fine. BUT CHECK OUT THE HUUUUUGE PORTIONS!!! OMG! LMAO! JPIA! I have found the dinner to be more appetizing than their breakfast (which is the opposite of what they are known for). The time I tried the highly recommended chicken and waffles, I was underwhelmed. However, I am not really a chicken and waffles type of guy. The dish just perplexes me. The food is satisfying enough, just do not expect to be wowed by anything other than having more food than you can eat. (Which is a good thing.) (I think.)

On my first visit we got there right before brunch was ending and I wanted to order off that menu, but our waiter never came back and then I saw him go over to 2 other tables of people seated after me and then he disappeared into the kitchen. Luckily my boyfriend went and got another waiter to come over with 1 minutes left to order brunch. Very nice waiters, but I would have been very sad if I could not have ordered off that brunch menu. Second trip my food was accidentally given to the table next to me and the man didn't notice so he started eating it! But it was not a big deal because they made me a new one and even took it off our bill - which was very nice since many places only apologize for mistakes and do not comp the meal. Overall the food is great and I would come here to eat again!",

I previously made that mistake, but given his forgiving taste buds, I chose not to steer him clear.  the highlight of the evening was when he commented that the field of fried leeks piled on the dish tasted like hay.  he then proceeded to ask the server if the owner of hhagg also owned a rosemary farm.  priceless.",

Let me start by saying that my wife and I are huge Hash House fans. We go to the West Sahara location regularly and have been to to the M Resort location as well and never had a bad experience. I wish I could say the same for our one trip the the new Plaza Hash House. The food was as great as it is at the other locations, but the service was very poor. There wasn't a friendly face in the restaurant, our meals were not served at the same time (lunches for the 5 of us arrived over about a 15 minute span) and it took nearly 20 minutes to get our check after our plates were taken away. The couple that was with us enjoyed their meal, but were so put off by the service that they said they probably wouldn't return. We assured them that the other locations didn't operate like the Plaza location. And no, I'm not a hyper-sensitive Yelper. I worked in the service industry for years and I understand the difference between a busy establishment where people are busting their butts and maybe it causes me to wait a few extra minutes. I have no problem with that. This restaurant was about half full and there was a lot of standing around going on. Hopefully the owner of this location will take some of these reviews about the poor service to heart and make some changes. I hate to say it, but my guess is that the employees of this Hash House are from the Culinary Union which for me would answer a lot of questions.",

    "text": "we tried this place and 4 out of the 7 people eating in our party got sick.   The restaurant manager tried to claim that food poisoning only happens in 12 -24 hours. Which may be True for salmonella or e. coli, but can happen very fast for things like staph bacteria poisoning. Within 20 minutes, actually.   The manager refused to believe us, refused to give us any satisfaction, and when we had to run off to vomit instead of continuing the conversation, yelled more useless facts about salmonella poisoning after us. I'd like to see his food safety certificate, I'm sure it's out of date.  Also, the service was deadly slow and the prices expensive.   Awful, awful place. Avoid at all cost.",

Service was not so good. The busboy had to call the waiter to take our order. When the waiter came, he had an attitude. Ordered the Roasted Chicken Hash w/ asparagus, garlic, rosemary. The amount was huge. It was good..... but it felt the pieces where a bit too big. Like they just peeled the chicken off the bone & It was a dry. I went a second time to give the place another chance. This time ordered it to go. I got the Corned beef hash & eggs. I guess they don't have knives in the kitchen becuz the corned beef was shredded into big pieces. With the size of the pieces, the corned beef was tough & chewy. The only good things was. the eggs where perfect (over easy) and the toast was perfect. Oh, they only have marmalade if you eat in & honey if you order to go. The portions where worth what you pay for......",

Stayed at the Plaza and apreciated the fact I could stagger out of bed hung over and enjoy a Hash House breakfast without driving to the other side of town.  Service was really poor.  Took almost 15 minutes to get drinks.  I ordered a HH Bloody Mary.  Now, I wasn't expecting Grey Goose or anything, but I've tasted better rubbing alcohol that the house vodka they used in this.  Server was never anywhere to be found, but a hostess did a good job with the drinks.  Food quality was good, but portions were smaller than at the Sahara location.  I was with a friend who is a bit of a grumpy old man so I'm sure his attitude didnt help.",

    "text": "First of all... I am not the type to talk bad on a place.. that is ofcourse until they treat the customer like crap... which is the experience I just had at the Plaza Casino Hash house.  They entice casino patrons to eat there by offering discount coupons upon checkin... then find every excuse not to fulfill them.  We had a four top wait 10 minutes just to be sat (at the front hostess stand) The short haired african american girl that worked at 5pm 1/9/2012 likes to talk more than work. Then we waited for another 5-10 minutes just to get a server and put in the drink orders.  At 515 pm... they then stated that our 10 dollar coupon would not be honored.. even though we clearly were there before the 5pm cutoff... the server even remembered us from a previous visit... and should have known that we are excellent tippers!! What an idiot... I hope you enjoyed your tip that we deducted the ten bux from!!!! Bahahahhahaahhahahahaha (pause for deep breath) hahahahahahahahahaahahahahaa!!!!.  Food wise.... do not order your own portion... SHARE!!!  The portions are HUUUUUGE... and perfect for 2 people... save your money for the casino or alcohol.  I will never be back, and will be spreading the word to everyone who considers this Downtown Vegas Hash House  location.  Very Very Very poor service and the manager of the place should take notes from Adam (GM) in the Oscar's restaurant upstairs!  Go to Denny's or the Mcdonalds inside the casino before eating here.... Not that I expect any changes, but the owner of this location should consider why the restaurant is suffering. PATHETIC!!!!",

So we ordered. My friend ordered the chicken eggs benedict. Still had high hopes he took a picture. I ordered some kind of Fried Chicken with a biscuit. Neither one fo was impressed. After we left we both thought wow that was horrible especially when I think our bill was $48....Of course we had 2 Bloody Mary's. My friend said it was good. I had never had one so i ordered it. Took me all day to get that taste out of my mouth and I only had a few drinks of it and gave it to him. Oh well no I know. May give them another try some days but I guess that would be if everything else was closed.",

    "text": "To put it simply...the best breakfast I had in Vegas.  While the buffets are good at filling you up with huge plates of food...the quality can be a little lacking. Hash House A Go Go will cost you a little more, but the combination of huge portions and great tasting food will satisfy you.   I had the Corned Beef House Hash...which was quite delicious.  Although huge, I was able to put most of it away.  Of course I walked around for a couple of hours feeling quite stuffed.  You can tell just by the look and taste that everything is prepared fresh...no canned stuff here. My brother had the sage fried chicken benedict dish...which he raved about.  It was even larger than my plate and he couldn't finish. My mom had a basic breakfast of eggs scrambled, biscuit, hash brown potatoes, and bacon.  This was too large for her and she couldn't finish either. One thing that you have to try if you come here is the Watermelon/Kiwi Lemonade.  I didn't order it, but had a taste of my brothers...it was delicious and quite refreshing. This location is convenient if you are staying downtown as it is located in the Plaza hotel lobby area.  There was no significant wait to eat here(we waited about 10 minutes for a table), but we went on a Monday about 9AM or so...so could be different on weekends or at different times. Highly recommended.",

When I said I am a customer standing here. they replied sorry, they texted first so you will have to wait.  I won't be dining here again. Plenty of restaurants in Vegas to choose from",

The stars of the breakfast orders at my table were the banana-pecan french toast and the meatloaf hash (though it is not over hasbrowns but diced breakfast potatoes). The blueberry pancake was good and one pancake is enough for a person - at least 12\" in diameter. Fast, friendly service and they treated the child with us nicely, providing crayons and an inexpensive kid's menu. They also have a hefty military discount.   The downside was that it was very loud - with competing music playing from the casino and overhead. :(",

    "text": "This review is for anyone with food allergies, specifically gluten free.   Before our trip to Las Vegas one of our foodie friends suggested we visit this place. We were excited when we accidentally stumbled upon this place. We came at the last minute on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait long to be seated. That's the end of the good from here. I HATE leaving bad reviews. I work at a hotel and used to work at a restaurant, so I understand this industry, but what we experienced was so beyond \"bad\" service I'm at a loss for words. I originally wanted just to send the owners an email, but I couldn't find any contact info...Then I thought that others with food allergies need to know. I want to point out that I'm not looking for anything from management, I just want other gluten free travelers to know about my experience here.   I have Celiac Disease, so if I eat anything with wheat in it I get really sick. Before we even got sat we asked the manager that was on duty if they had anything gluten free that I could eat. He said \"Yes of course. Everything is made to order so you should be able to find something.\" Perfect! So we were seated. Our waitress came over and took our drink order. I asked her what she recommended that was gluten free and her response was \"Uhhh...umm...we don't have anything gluten free.\" From there it was back and forth with her and the manager we talked to earlier. All I really wanted was an egg, bacon, and some hash browns. The manager said the hash browns come pre-packaged and seasoned (what happened everything made to order?) and would have to check on the label. When he came back he said they were gluten free. Then the server came back and I told her what I wanted and she said  \"No, he is wrong. They aren't gluten free.\" I have never had an issue with ANY restaurant I've been to about trying to find out if I can have something gluten free. If they don't that's fine and I'll find a safe place for me to eat. But the lack of communication between management and the servers was the worst I've ever experienced. I was to the point of tears and had to embarrassingly ask where the restroom was so I could pull myself together. After that we never saw our waitress again. I could tell she was upset with us, but really? She never came back by to see if everything was okay or offer refill on coffee. We saw her chatting it up with the table behind us. We waited for nearly 10 minutes before she came back to give us our check. When we did finally see her she threw it on the table without even looking at us or saying a word. I have never felt more humiliated in my life! There are SO many great restaurants in the area, this one isn't worth the headache (and tears) for people with food allergies. We won't be back.",

First off, it's a pretty nice restaurant...for where it's located.  It was clean and there was no line (7 am in Vegas, go figure).  They get a start for that.  When I say that we were extremely hungry, we were.  But the portions of food are SO extreme, I don't know how anyone finishes their plate there.  This is the restaurant of gluttony.  The three of us could have shared one meal and still had leftovers.  Other than having a massive amount of food, there's nothing special about this place.  The biscuit was rock hard and tasteless, the hash was nothing special, and the potatoes were MEHHH at best.  The food took almost 25 minutes to come out.  I'll never go again and definitely not recommended.  Especially for you Hawaii people who know a good hash.",

For dinner, I had the griddled cheese and he had the stuffed burger. They were HUGE, we were not able to finish them. Delicious though, and our waitress was very nice. We tipped her a little extra. I also tried their strawberry lemonade margarita and it was AMAZING.  Breakfast was a little more disappointing, but not because of the food. I had the pancake combo and he had the chicken and waffles. Also huge portions, but at least we (well, me at least) were able to finish them. I also tried the kiwi watermelon lemonade which was also amazing.   Our waitress that day was nice at first, but getting the check took forever. When she finally came back it was to confirm that we were the people with the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestraunt.com&s=529e958f9bd0073c27d14702c134e2258e1b1357238161f2861bd35736c7c1d2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restraunt.com</a> coupon, then she was gone again for another 10 mins. It got pretty annoying, especially because we had finished some time ago and our plates were already gone. The waitress the day before had a party of 32 she was attending to, yet she was still able to tend to our needs in a timely matter!",

You'll never hear anyone praise the chef. And you'll probably be looking at someone who the word \"Sansabelt\" is usually proceeded by, \"where are the..?\" I'll just say it, this place is for fat people who are probably cheap but think they're too good to go to a buffet. Or their too lazy to make the eight trips back and forth to get the same amount of food you'll get on one entree here. Or too embarrassed.   My uh food was ostensibly an egg Benedict. I think Benedict Cumberbatch was buried somewhere between the potato farm and the layers of some weird cheese pancake that was covered in the exact same chipotle they serve at ISIS training camps to get new recruits to hate infidels. \"Eat so you can taste the hell that is the American Southwest! Death to America!\" I totally would understand after eating this.   Wait. There's more! It's 110 in the shade but the chef/menu committee decided to remind us that somewhere it's Christmas. How? You ask. By impaling a 7ft Norwegian pine smack dab in the middle of my food. And probably poor Benedict Cumberbatch buried in the goo. Who does that? Why? Norway should revoke the visas of anyone currently terrorizing their pine forests. Have some national pride. Don't let Hash House ruin people's memories of your...hmm...ok, you have nothing.   But I digress. This gawdawful concoction had so many levels of early 21 st century cliches that it should be cited as non ada compliant as there's no elevator to get from top to bottom. Did I mention the tree in the middle of it all? Oh. I did. The \"gravy\"... Chipotle is not to be used on non combatants according to the Geneva convention. That's been standard since the war in Grenada. If Rumsfeld should be on trial the person who created this time culinary bomb ought to be in the docket right next to him. Hell, I'd spend the night with Dick Cheney and his mean straight daughter rather than eat this again.   Oh yeah. There's chicken in here somewhere but I never got near it. After a portion of potatoes that could have saved half of Ireland during the famine I was too full to get poor Benedict Cumberbatch to move over to let me power up the ol' chainsaw and cut off a piece of the  Flintstone size buzzards breast. Sorry. So very sorry.",

Staff: nice, friendly, courteous, and timely Restaurant: average ambiance, clean, spacious Prices: pretty good relative to other Vegas restaurants Portion size: very large; good place to split a meal  The food itself it fine. A friend had the HH original benedict, which was huge and covered with red pepper cream instead of hollandaise sauce. There was a lot going on with that plate. It was OK. My husband had the basic. Eggs were cooked just fine, and the bacon was pretty ordinary. The biscuit was pretty dry and definitely needs a good amount of butter and/or preserves. I had the sundried tomato, goat cheese, and basil egg scramble. It was a nice flavor, with lots of sundried tomatoes, but I didn't see or taste any basil. Accompanying crispy potatoes were pretty bland, and accompanying fruit was a single slice of orange and a single slice of melon (I was expecting a bit more).  That being said, I didn't feel like I was completely ripped off after eating here. The problem with Vegas restaurants is that the convenient, no name places in a hotel/casino lobby is that they're convenient but extremely overpriced and serve terrible, terrible food. Hash House prices are OK, and the quality and portion sizes are reasonable. I would go back.",

The entire evening, he was very attentative and really cared about our well being.  He also had other tables besides ours, and through the entire night his attitude was above reproach.  He was so good at what he did he should be a manager not a server.  I have been to many places and our server here was one of the best I have ever had.  The food was aweseom as well, the portions are way more then one person can eat, so we did a lot of splitting.  At the end of the meal, he made sure the cake we dropped off earlier was ready for us.  When we were all done, he was nice enough to do separate checks for people who wanted them.  I am telling you at not time did his attitude ever change from AWESOME!!

The serving is huge so share it with a friend if your a lightweight. Or just unbutton your pants and pig out solo... always my choice! The pancakes are also a great choice, not only are they massive in size but the pack tremendous flavor as well if you happen to not be in the mood for a gargantuan benny. One of the top 5 breakfast spots in sin city in my humble opinion.",

From past experiences,  I knew not to order the Sage Chicken Benedict, as it's dry and tastes like baby puke. I'm a big Benedict fan. So that's a let down. So my first choice was another random breakfast, but there was something in it that I didn't like,  and they wouldn't modify it. Back up plan was the salmon Benedict.. it was just gross. Dry. Fishy as ever. Stunk. I wouldn't call it a Benedict. Hollandaise sauce and eggs on top of bread of some kind is what it should be. Not dry potatoes, dry biscuit, and dry protein covered in puke sauce. Large portions of that does not make it better. Service was mediocre. Energy sucked. My dining mate also was not happy with his food. It's large portions of eclectic concoctions that don't mesh well together.  If you do go here, stick to pancakes or waffles. Their savory dishes leave much to be desired.",

    "text": "My husband and I arrived to hash house a go go at 815am on a Friday morning. So we were expecting a bit of a wait. Hostess gave us a pager and said it would be 30-45 minutes. Not a problem, I said and asked how far the range was and was told to stay on the main floor and not to leave the casino and it would work. After over an hour I returned to see how much longer our wait was going to be. Come to find out the hostess had forgotten about us and had skipped us. Not a problem l, you were busy, that's understandable. We get seated and I try to order orange juice, only to be informed that they're out of orange juice. How, on a busy Friday morning are you already out of orange juice? Oh well. We order our meals, a basic and apple cinnamon flapjack with whipped cream. Oh, now you're also out of sausage and bacon? Well that eliminates a good portion of your menu. After being seated for about 5 minutes 3 booths near us were seated. Yet somehow all 3 ordered orange juice and got it. Before my husband and I even got our drinks. After waiting for 45 minutes for our food to finally arrive, my potatoes are cold, my husbands pancakes have 4 paper thin slices of apples that are nearly blackened from being burned and there's no whipped cream. I try to ask for a side of hollandaise sauce since there is a section on the menu for eggs Benedict, but much to my surprise and chagrin I am informed that there is no hollandaise sauce in the restaurant. After we attempt to eat and decide it's not worth the hassle and ask for he check we still have to wait an additional 20 minutes for an incorrect check. Needless to say we were not impressed nor will we ever recommend this location which is a shame considering every other hash house a go go I have been to (multiple locations in Las Vegas and the Chicago location) I have never had such horrendous food not service",

Our waiter however on the other hand was horrible. He didn't write down our orders, some of which had changes to what was listed on the menu.  As a former server, making sure your guest gets their order right the first time is key. Not forgetting what was said, coming back twice to correct it and still bring the meals out incorrectly.  What was even more frustrating was that we didn't get our drinks filled as needed or when we asked for extra plates, condiments, etc we were forgotten, or had to ask several times, including asking other servers for help because ours was no where to be found. Also, we were charged for items we didn't ask for and also were charged for BBQ sauce that was not BBQ sauce.  The hash house in the quad hotel and casino was a bust service wise, however the food was delicious.",

So beware - there are not that many similar restaurants on Fremont and as our Vegas trips always include at least a day on Fremont we will be looking for another standard to eat at - have visited three to four times a year for about 6 years - I even took a group of 20 here for a birthday breakfast I loved it that much!

I called The Plaza location and was kindly informed that there was no wait at the moment. We made way over and were seated immediately.

My husband ordered the chicken and waffles along with a side of biscuits and gravy, and I ordered the infamous Andys sage fried chicken w/spinach and chipotle cream.  EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD!!  I accidentally ordered the wrong Andys dish and I offered to take it to-go while I ordered the correct dish, but the gentleman who brought my food over said not to worry about it and got the right dish out to me in no time.  It was extremely nice of them considering I was the one who made the mistake.  Service was a little slow towards the end but not enough to make me think anything less of the place.

    "text": "LV native now, and was 1st year I decided I needed a cooking break on turkey day. I realize nothing is as good as homemade on Thanksgiving, but went in with an open mind, given this restaurant's positive reviews. Made an unnecessary reservation, as the place was virtually empty when we arrived, which was lucky, as whoever took my reservation only hours earlier, didn't write it down.  The waitress arrived quickly and took our order quick as well, as we were all decided we would order the turkey dinner. She was a little off putting, as in not friendly, which I would later realize the reason, we we were arriving at end of her shift on Thanksgiving.  It took no more than 5-10 minutes to receive our plates. Looked decent, but tasted not so decent. The turkey and stuffing were moist, but there was probably about an ounce of gravy on the potatoes. I asked the food runner if we could have more, and she rolled her eyes and said \"I'll have to check with the kitchen.\" She brought back for three of us about one more ounce of gravy to share. The mashed potatoes served with dinner were like bricks that seemed to be sitting the entire day, were not warm, and lacked any flavoring such as milk and butter. Vegetables served were carrots, green beans and a small ear of corn. The corn was cooked properly, but the carrots and green beans were virtually raw, and the carrots were so tough I couldn't cut with a knife. None of the vegetables arrived with butter or any seasoning, just plain and hard; reminded me of my kids' school lunches! The dinner was to come with cranberry sauce, which it did in a tiny ramekin usually seen in restaurants that put ketchup in for fries. There was approximately one tablespoon each. Given my kids love cranberry sauce, I forfeited my tablespoon so they could each have an extra 1/2 tablespoon; what a joke.   For dessert we ordered pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin bread pudding. When I ordered dessert, the waitress indicated she was \"going to get out of here,\" and I believe the bartender was going to finish up our table. She brought us the check, my tab was approximately $80, and although the food was sub-par and she wasn't the friendliest, I gave her a 20% tip. She was never seen again.  Meanwhile, our pumpkin cheesecake arrived immediately from a food runner. My kids and I had a few bites, but it didn't taste like cheesecake to me. Rather, it had a strong taste of cool whip in the filling. My two little sweet freaks didn't touch it yesterday in the fridge at home, and I'll toss it today. After waiting 30 minutes for anyone to pass by to get their attention, I managed to get two hosts' attention. Our bread pudding was missing in action, and at about the 40th minute the food runner returned with the bread pudding. I told her no way, wasn't paying for it, as I just told the host 10 minutes prior same, and was waiting for the manager to return my bread pudding money. He did ultimately run a new check canceling the dessert charges and apologizing for our waitress taking off before ensuring our dessert was delivered. Obviously, we were forgotten about. He gave us the bread pudding, but no one has touched it in the fridge.   The entire experience and food were subpar, and given this restaurant's reviews, I had high hopes, and a crummy buffet would have been a far better option for the price. Because of this experience, we will never dine at this chain again.",

I didn't order any of the main attractions (chicken and waffles) but the blueberry HH pancakes were delicious, biscuits and gravy very good, Bloody Mary good (bloody martini not ) , the chorizo was ok but nothing special. Our waitress was very friendly and very busy. We did make the mistake of going to breakfast around 10 am on 4/20 (didn't think anything of it until we left our room) and the wait was long. But it seemed like everyone had \"waked and baked\". The next day we ate at 930 and had no wait whatsoever.",

We went this morning (a Sunday morning) around 10a and Only had a twenty minute wait! They were friendly and accommodating to our party of five including a baby in a stroller. Our waitress came over almost immediately and service continued to be quite quick from there. Since I'd been to another location before, I know how large their portions are. My husband wasn't eating, so the rest of us shared a bacon, avocado and cheese scramble and a side of chicken sausage. It came with one huge biscuit, strawberry jam, crispy potatoes (you can get mashed if you prefer), a wedge of cantaloupe and a wedge of orange. The absolute best part of the meal was how cheesey and flavorful the scramble was! There was so much cheese that when you pulled a bite away with your fork, there was a lot of gooey, stringy cheese trailing behind. Yum!! Major win!! I was also impressed with the chicken sausage  - two HUGE links.   Like I said, I've been to a Hash House before. And I enjoyed myself. But I have to say that this visit was what made me feel like I need to come back more. I will certainly think of this place when it comes to having breakfast when family is in town. There are other dishes I need to try! The table next to us ordered the corned beef hash and it looked great!!",

Since this is almost the only decent breakfast at this end of Downtown Las Vegas (Dupar's closed and MTA requires walking through the homeless hoard), I expected the standards to be less than stellar. I mean, really, they have no competition.  What I found was a delightfully clean, efficiently run, full service diner. Kudos to the Hostess (I am sorry that I did not get her name, BUT, she had purple braids, so maybe that will identify her?) who made arrangements for us to accommodate a dietary restriction for someone in our party. This was real customer service! Our Server made his dislike of the accommodation clear, but adhered to (it looked like he complained to the Hostess). We were also impressed by the older gentleman in the red shirt and jeans who brought our food. His demeanor was that of Hoosier and someone who had a stake in the place. It is great to see that work ethic. A solidly nice, homey, experience.",

    "text": "I had a pretty good time eating at the Summerlin location and the one in the Linq casino.  This one is located in the Plaza hotel downtown but this time around, for whatever reason, it wasn't all that thrilling.  Perhaps because it was the one meal in LV on this trip that I decided to take the trashiness of the food down a level?  At around 10 AM we did have to put our name on a waiting list but it only took about 5 or 10 minutes before I got a text telling us to head back to the host.    The waitress and staff were kind and definitely kept our water and coffee full.  No problems there.  Mom and I split the Healthy Start with spinach, mushrooms and onions and a side order of Biscuit and Gravy for $5 (to offset being TOO healthy, you understand)!  The other half of our party ordered the Crab Benedict.  They brought out the Healthy Start but when they found out they had mis-keyed a Benedict with Fried Chicken instead of Crab, they corrected it within minutes!  Great service, no question.    The issue was really the food.  It was just good, not great.  To the point that we didn't order anything decadent which is kind of the point of eating at Hash House A Go Go, the two people who ordered the Benedict didn't have anything much to say and one of them could only eat a little because the sauce was too spicy for her.  We did have the biscuit and gravy but it was also just okay.  Nothing great.  We ate because we were hungry, but we'll probably try something else next time when staying downtown.",

This particular trip on 3/26/17 was not the best.  I ordered the Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin and it was great until I found the 2 bone fragments about 10% of the way through.  I wasn't really that hungry so I intended to take half back to the hotel to eat later, but when I pointed out the bone to the waitress she took the food away and got the manager.  He took off 1/2 the price of the entree (which was well over $20) which was fine, had I had more than 3 bites before it was taken away.  So, I paid about $12 for about $4 worth of food.  Crappy experience, but all the others have been great, so I'll chock it up to an off-day.  My fave is still the Sage Chicken & Waffles, but the pot pie, meatloaf, chicken fried steak and pork tenderloin are all outstanding.",

Chicken Pot Pie, egg scrambles, I haven't had anything here that was ever less than fantastic.   The service though... man. I've been here multiple times and it's always the same. Waitresses act too busy for you and rarely checking on you. The person I was with ordered a different scramble (omelette) than I did, and the waitress repeated the order back to us. The runner then brought out two of the same scrambles.  We let them know this wasn't what was ordered (the runner, since our waitress was no where to be found & couldn't be bothered to bring our order out to us)  They finally bring out the correct order but are SO condescending. 'I would have bet on my life that this is what you ordered. Enjoy.' Uhhh. Good thing you didn't place any bets then because it was definitely not what they ordered! Or what she repeated back to us.  Don't expect any refills, you probably won't get any.",

As usual the staff was awesome. I mean way above their normal good service. Rachel was so awesome it really added to the experience and management kept coming around and making sure our group of 30 were all being served and happy.   Since we typically share, I haven't tried too many dishes here because my wife is not big on trying new things. OK, I'll say it, she likes it simple and she likes it that way. Today I got see some new dishes. One of the most amazing was the chicken pot pie. That is definitely my new order. Oh wait, my son had the corned beef sandwich, maybe that's next. Another friend had the salmon and that looked really good. Oh man, this party may have blown my desire to share.  Thank you HH staff for making this a memorable event.",

I do have some gripes which aren't much. The CFS plate comes with green beans, but uou only get like 6-7 green beans. 3 cups of mashed potatoes but only a handful of green beans? And the biscuit. It was so.dry. Painfull dry. Even dousing it in the jelly it was like sand.   Even with the gripes I have to give it 5 stars because of how good it was. My husband honestly wanted to go back the next day and said it was at the top of his CFS list. We are from Texas, so believe me, we know chicken fried steak.",

    "text": "Ended up here twice on the last trip to Vegas cuz it was in the hotel (The Plaza) & I'd enjoyed HHAGG before.  Second morning in Vegas, ordered \"The Basic\" with eggs over medium , bacon, griddled mashed potatoes, biscuit & side of gravy.  Breakfast came out with cubed potatoes & when I pointed it out, the runner promptly brought out a side of the smashers...not very griddled but whatever, they were delicious.  Biscuit was a little dry so I was glad I had the gravy for dunking. It also came with marmalade which was pretty tasty.  Breakfast was decent & more than I could eat...this being HHAGG and all.  Dinner the next night was Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles (Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks)  Chicken was tender & juicy with a nice fried crust. It's not boneless...in case that's a make or break for you.  The waffles had a crispy crunch with a fluffy center and BACON!) but needed more syrup, which I got right away upon on request. The syrup reduction tasted more like teriyaki...I wasn't a fan of that or the leeks but that's just me.  Again, too much to eat.  For both meals service wasn't too attentive. They kind of just take your order, check back once shortly after food is served, let you eat your meal then drop off the check. Not a deal breaker for a casino hotel restaurant.  All in all both meals were tasty but I think the main appeal of HHAGG is the huge portions & I'm more of a nibbler. Large servings & buffets are lost on me.  That being said, try it out, the food IS good & if you love hearty portions, THIS is your place.",

    "text": "This is our umpteenth time going here and usually tradition to get the sage fried chicken Benedict or the chicken and waffles. My girlfriend had a coupon and well they didn't honour it on mobile phone so the server told us go upstairs to business centre and well we were charged $3.99 a print out so ended up saving $1 basically but oh well the food was well worth it.  If you can download and print the BOGO dinner but only valid M-F. You basically save about $15-25 depending on what menu items you choose. We were almost there for the happy hour $3,4 drinks and appies!!   We had a reservation which was unfulfilled. The hostess seemed stressed out so we didn't even bother. Reason why I have given Hash House a 3/5 is because of the wait for the food. One entree came and the next came out 36 minutes later. But worst part was to try and pay the bill took 18 minutes timed. I could've been a jerk and just ate and left and not paid.   We had plenty of leftovers because by the tile last entree came we were stuffed from The chicken and waffles, so the bums along Fremont were very happy!   I suggest you make reservation or come early, or else WAIT WAIT WAITTTTTT",

The salsa they serve with it is actually more like jam and had a very sweet taste as opposed to spicy.   Had to ask for butter for the biscuit since it was not served alongside with it. Server never checked on us to see if we were okay until we were done and he brought our check! I had to ask for more coffee at that point as well. He was apologetic and super friendly though.  Definitely better restaurants in Vegas.",

We said okay and put our names down. We checked back when 40 minutes passed and was told there was only 1 party ahead of us. Time goes by and we see 2 large parties get seated. We checked on our table for the 3rd time for our party of 5, and the girls didn't seem to have an explanation for why we were bumped from the list. We even brought it up that we waited over an hour and that we were told 30-35 minutes. Didn't seem like they knew what they were doing, nor did they care.   After all that we finally get seated on a tiny booth (they put a chair at the end). When our food arrives we mention that this won't all fit on the table and the waitress says \"you'll figure it out\". There was a bigger table available and no one offered to move us there. Instead they told us to \"figure it out\".  Such a shame considering the food was good. Won't be returning to this location due to the rudeness and terrible customer service we received. Don't recommend.   The girls working between 1030am-1pm up front need a customer service class, as well as the blonde waitress with the glasses working that shift.",

I've eaten there four times now and it was great every time. I've sampled the country fried steak, the chicken and waffles, the hammered pork tenderloin and the fried chicken eggs Benedict. I'm not stopping until I try the whole menu. The service is always quick and friendly and the portions are massive. the concepts are unique and the flavors pop. This will be my go-to place to take people who come to visit when I move to NV. Also, their red mashed potatoes are straight crack!",

    "text": "My husband declared this the worst breakfast he has ever had. I think he was exaggerating. But certainly it was up there. Let's start with our arrival. When we asked for a table for 5, the hostess seemed to move in slow motion, with no mojo, no get up and go. Just like someone might move if they were a robot on the slow setting. I've never seen someone who just didn't bother when people were waiting. She somehow had to look around with her eyes slowly to find a table that was free.   And then we got a table, and we ordered our food, and shame on us for not knowing exactly what we wanted to order the moment the waitress asked. I think this delayed things a bit because she didn't come back after that. No, we were off the radar and we had to wait and wait until we could see her again. And then we ordered and waited more than 45 minutes for our food. It was interminably long. Our waitress disappeared regularly. The coffee guy was consistent, an amazing gem of a man, who was always on the job, ready to fill up our cups.  Now on to the food. My husband hated my food. He said the beef was weird in the hash. He didn't like any of it. I actually really liked my biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are so tall and flaky and delicious - it's a shame that the delivery mechanism to get said biscuits is so poor. My overeasy egg was perfect. It was an overall delicious plate of food so I can't fault them for that and I've given an additional star for that. Oh yes and for the fact that our food arrived hot. I was panicky after reading so many reviews saying their food was cold. Ours was hot! Another worthy star.   One more thought - my son ordered a kid's burger and that didn't include cheese. We didn't think to order it with cheese so when it arrived, it had no cheese. And by the time, we lifted the bun, which revealed no cheese, the waitress was long gone. Well, here's where things went right. We asked another waitress for a slice of cheese to put on the burger. She disappeared and a long period of time followed. Seasons changed. The next fall season of TV shows were revealed and still we waited, but here's the beauty part. When the cheese did arrive, they delivered it hot. It had been melted on the grill and we could actually move the slice onto the burger. No cold slice of cheese to add to a now cold burger that had been sitting with its metaphorical cheese in the wind. Win! And so I bring you a happy ending to what was a rather frustrating breakfast experience.",

I didn't remember the food being good, just that the portions were ridiculous.  The portions are still ridiculous, and the food is not good. They did a bunch of things that were just meh. Why did they skewer the breakfast steak? Why did they overcook said steak? Why did the salmon scramble contain barely any salmon, and when a piece was found, why was it dry as all hell and super fishy? Why were the dishes brought out at different times so we were stuck waiting for others to get their orders? But hey, I had eggs over hard and they were done correctly.  The only pro was that the service was very good. Though they gave us all biscuits by accident, they quickly fixed this.  I guess if I had to fish for another pro, it's that the portions were huge so the prices were not as outrageous had they been smaller portions. I wouldn't go as far as to say avoid this place at all costs, but to be fair there are plenty of better options for breakfast in this area.",

When she came around again we told her that both meals were cold and we want to new hot breakfast meals. Manager came over and asked what the deal is. He told us he would get us some new meals that were hot in 15 to 20 minutes. My scramble came out about 15 minutes later and her scramble came out about five minutes after that. They were both hot this time.  Ron the manger comped both of our meals. Our waitress did not even come back by during our meals to refill our empty water glasses. Oh well so sad.

Unless you normally eat a dozen eggs, whole slab of bacon and 12 pancakes, you are in big trouble...LOL!  They have a great selection of foods from their meatloaf omelet to sandwiches and pancakes.  The food is fresh and full of flavor.  For those who enjoy chicken and waffles in the morning, c'mon on down!  Their pancakes are light and fluffy.  As Al Roker said in their menu, \"They're bigger than my head!\"  Just one 10 inch pancake will be hard to finish let alone 3 of these monsters.  The servers are wonderful and the food comes piping hot.  Speaking of which, their cocoa comes with marshmallows in it.  Real marshmallows and not those little thimble size ones with a rich chocolate flavor.  The dishes are large enough that you can order one plate and share it.  Great place and I'll definitely be back!",

But who cares, we took an Uber and enjoyed the ride. This place was packed and I understand why, we sat at the bar and the 2 female bartenders (one had a similar mine, Cherie) are drinks were on point---BLT Bloody Mary (the bacon). We order our food and never expected what was served to us... check out the pics! The portions are large enough to serve 3 people, so share your meals. I will go to Hash House A Go-Go every time I go to Vegas in the future!!!",

If memory serves, and to be honest it was a little fuzzy at that time, I got a Tractor combo with blueberry flapjack and lemon curd.  I remember it being incredibly delicious.  It was SO good.  Everyone else's food was good as well, and the portions are ridiculous.

The food was okay. My Caesar salad was a definite disappointment. The dressing was horrible, the chicken was good, and the lettuce was warm and on the verge of wilting.

But I got a box to take it home. It was just so good I couldn't leave it there to waste. One meal is enough to share. This hidden gem is a must try along with the Freemont Experience.

They said I could order lunch instead (all breakfast entrees came w/ 2 eggs). Or they said they would leave the eggs off and I could pay $4.50 to my $13 breakfast to add a biscuit. The manager was rude & not concerned about losing our business over substituting a five cent piece of toast for 2 eggs. My party of 4 walked out & will never go back. It's obvious they prey on one-time tourists & don't care about keeping local repeat customers.

The two patties were both cooked bone-dry.  I had to remove one so I could choke down the other.  The seasoning and additions did nothing to make up for the overcooked meat.  We decided to try breakfast another day.  Once again, the huge portions did not disguise the trend toward over-cooking here.  I have had Denny's breakfasts better prepared.  It may be a problem of this particular location, but with all the options available in Vegas, you could only do better anywhere for the price.",

We wait & wait, no warm up on my coffee offered. The MANAGER brings my husband's order & leaves. 10 minutes later my food has not arrived and my husband's is cold because he refuses to start eating without me, plus his order is wrong. Another 5 minutes, gum smacker shows up, says she will bring more coffee. Where's my food? She will check. More waiting, finally back with her gum a snacking and her attitude  ugly, says my food will be right out! I don't know when my order came because we left as did the couple across from us that was also waiting, watching & waiting some more.  We went across the street to Duprey's where we were greeted, seated, served and stuffed in 20 minutes. Great pancakes. Our waitress was a doll. Do not go go to Hash House A Go Go.

He made a mistake and charged my card three times the amount. He fixed it and we left giving him a 20% cash tip. To my surprise the initial charge was taken/held from my bank and when calling the manager Leilani she was not pleasant. I am very patient and she interrupted me and basically said call your bank on Monday and they will release the hold. She gave the obligatory I'm sorry but was rude and said we hold 20% on top of the total regardless.. we left our server cash.

My first impression was that the restaurant was dirty. The carpet looked old and the menus were a bit rough/worn out. It was also very HOT in the restaurant. Their air conditioning did not seem to be working properly. We had to ask to be moved to another section of the restaurant.  The prices were pretty standard for Vegas $10-20 for each meal. I ordered \"The Basic\" which came with sausage, toast, eggs and grits. All were pretty good. My sausage was very tender and flavorful. The grits were not bad, but not as good as we make them in Charleston!  My friend ordered the Farmer's Breakfast (?) which came with a MASSIVE pancake - one that we split. It was pretty good but I found it was tough to cut...a bit rubbery. Not fluffy.  I will say, our waitress was completely on her game - always quick with the refills, extra napkins, clearing plates and bringing the check. She was a star.  I'd probably visit again if I was nearby, but I would not make an effort/go out of my way for it.",

For example, their apple juice is freshly made so it's cloudy with a little bit of pulp - kind of like fresh squeezed orange juice.  It's not bad mind you, just stating a fact.

We have eaten at the ones in Vegas even the now-defunct one at the M Casino they are always great experiences the food is huge and beautifully prepared. The service is always good to Great and the prices are adequate considering the size I would definitely suggest one entree per 2 people if not 4 people. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars as the restaurant smells so badly of smoke from the casino and actually worse than that it's perfume smoke as they must be pumping some kind of perfumy air out to cover the smoke smell which actually makes it worse",

I probably drove her up the wall. She was so patient with me too... Their avocado toast is considered noteworthy and preferred over the salad choices. However, the macaroni 'n cheese wins over the avocado toast. I ordered sides: house salad with mac 'n cheese.  The side salad was a 2-cup salad with cucumber ranch. Their dressing was flavorless. The macaroni was fantastic.They have better things on the menu... However, I cane seeking a light vegetarian meal and found it.",

The lettuce could have been crisper as well.   The fries however, were en pointe!   Presentation was good until I saw the wilted lettuce.  I also ordered some kind of tea with vodka....hard pass on that as well as the sandwich.   I saw a line there today after church; I may give their breakfast a try tomorrow & will update.  Weeeeellll I had breakfast there. All I can say is the the food was tasteless. The biscuit was large - but not good. The egg was okay (after all it was only an egg) and the eggs were plentiful but not seasoned. The bacon was crisp -- just like I like it (almost burnt).  That's just me and my weird tastebuds.   The highlight was the grapefruit mimosa.  That's a real winner. If I EVER go back, it will be for the mimosa ONLY.",

The menu is extensive as always, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner items served all day. Prices are on the higher side, but remember that the portions here are gigantic. I eat a fair amount and even I always have leftovers.  The food is tasty with good flavors. The sage chicken and waffles were good, though I would prefer slightly crispier waffles and maple over plain syrup. The burger was huge and included two patties, but the meat was a bit dry/overcooked. I don't consider the dishes here mind-blowing, but this chain is definitely known in Vegas. This location is also standalone and not located inside a casino.  Service during this meal was genuine, warm, and very attentive. The waitress checked on us regularly and was excellent.  Overall, a solid dining establishment.",

    "text": "Good for a picture. Bad for your taste buds.   Known for its VERY LARGE portions of breakfast food, there always seems to be a long wait. Which is why I opted out my first few trips to Vegas. So imagine the disappointment when I waited so long to try somewhere that was such a letdown.   First, the restaurant itself is fine and wait staff is ok. It sort of reminds me of a Denny's but the atmosphere is a little nicer.   They call their fare 'Twisted Farm Food' and that's accurate with things like the 'BLT Mary' that is a Bloody Mary inspired by a BLT with a piece of lettuce bacon and tomato in it.   Ok so I have to just ask. Why is everything doused in sage? And when I say 'doused' .. I mean it. We ordered the fried chicken and eggs with the 'famous fried chicken and waffles' .. which yes ... they say 'sage' in the description but I couldn't have known it meant you'd essentially be eating sage with chicken and waffles for texture. It was just so bad.  On that note. The alcohol was good. Maybe that's the catch.  Excessive drinking in Vegas leads to the huge portions looking appetizing and being so drunk you don't necessarily care about flavor.",

My mom enjoyed the fact that there were slices of bacon cooked into the waffles. On the downside, she was served non hot coffee. My Dad's homemade corned beef hash was really good. There was cheese cooked in it and the biscuit was gigantic. My son had a bowl of Cheerios. You can't really mess that up. We had a nice experience here.

I have to say I think my eyes was bigger then my stomach which is always my problem.  I always order do much food but we barely eat half.  The chicken tenders in the bucket was 5 bucks that's darn good deal.  It was moist and juicy and it looked so cute in the silver bucket. We also shared the twisted burger. It was enough for us to share.  Cooked perfectly to my tasting.  The mac and cheese could've been a little more cheesier if that's even a word lol. It just looked so plain.   The Cesar salad was also good the dressing was delicious.  Service was okay our server could've checked iiib us more.  We'r wanted another dub nook but we were ask done with the meal so I've decided to skip it.   We will come back and bring a group of friends to try different things of the happy hour menu.",

Their breakfast quesadilla and grilled cheese are some of the best I've ever had. It's really hard venturing to other menu items when these two are always so solid and delicious.  Last time I was in Vegas, we stayed at the Golden Gate Hotel and ate here way more then I thought we would. Nothing is overpriced. You pay for exactly what you get. Quality and all. The drinks are even great! I love that they have so many options and even fun / funny drinks (such as PBR in a paper bag, etc.) The bacon bloody mary is amazing as well.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND hash house if you have never been or even if you've been a million times. This location is great and gets busy, but i feel like it's never busy enough where the wait isn't worth it.",

The entrees were enormous (3 people barely finished 1!!!), and the flavors were just as bold.  I now understand why Adam looked like he died and gone to heaven, because the twisted food was beyond amazing.   Ordering Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was a no brainer since it was the focal point on Adam's trip. And boy, it was nothing short of steller. The nutty corn-flake breading and thick creamy gravy over the bed of mashed potatoes and buttery biscuit was lethal.  It belongs in it's own category. Deadly, but totally worth it!",

    "text": "Hash House a Go Go is one of the top brunch spots in Las Vegas, specializing in massive portions of fresh from the farm food with unique culinary twists. And ever since it's feature on Man v. Food, it's become a destination spot for curious foodies like myself. So I couldn't resist this and made then my first choice for breakfast when staying downtown.  After much deliberation of the many wonderful-sounding breakfast items, I went for the item they tout as their best-known item, and the one that was featured on Man V. Food - the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It consists of a HUGE sage fried chicken breast, fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a split biscuit. Eyeing the portions of the other dishes - the biscuits and gravy are insanely huge - I knew I was in for a challenge.   This thing was RIDICULOUSLY HUGE - see the picture I included. And everything was, for the most part, excellent. However, I really couldn't taste the sage in the fried chicken all that much. Everything gets piled together and mushed together after a few bites. Also, the biscuits were a bit hard and there wasn't enough sauce for them soften up, so they were mostly discarded.   Still, I ate about 90% of the plate, and promptly put myself into a food coma. My plans to go over to the Nugget for poker were delayed by a slight nap and digestion period. This is a great foodie \"destination spot\" and somewhere that you can literally split a plate between two people and both be completely full. I can only imagine the amount of food they throw out here.",

Then again, most places downtown do have that same smell, it wasn't repulsive...just enough to catch your attention. Never in my life have I had the 'WOW factor' when getting a food item out as I had with the chicken and waffles here. It wasn't just us, pretty much everyone was looking over as it was being served with the same reaction. The food was INCREDIBLE. Everything in this pile had distinct flavors yet blended together perfect. It was honestly unlike anything I've ever had and I'm itching to go back. My mother and I split it and were more than full. This isn't your standard meal! We went around 2pm and we got right in. Staff was friendly, nothing exceptional but no complaints. All food being served looked equally good.",

    "text": "This place is over hyped and over loved.   We were seated fairly fast. But it seemed they gave us too small a table for 3 adults and one child. And knowing we had a toddler with us, it was not so kid friendly. Items all over the table, in reach of the high chair.   My server was not so friendly, not so attentive and just wasn't on her game. But I told myself, it would be worth it. Everyone raves about this place. But I should have trusted my gut.If you start off with a poor server, then it can't get much better.   The server kept rushing and rushing us. RUDE!!! So we ordered and per suggestion of the server, I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. My husband ordered the Tractor Driver Combo. For my son, I ordered a grilled cheese off the kids meal.  Let's break it down.  Chicken Benedict = Dry, Bland and piled high with \"mashed\" potatoes. I quote \"mashed\" because right in the middle of my mashed potatoes were two whole potatoes that somehow were forgotten. The egg on my meal was dry and tasteless. They could have cooked it in the microwave because that is sure what it tasted like. The fried chicken was hard and dry as well. No seasoning to be found.  The best part of my meal was the melted cheese all over the dish, in fact it was the only thing i found appetizing on my plate. The next best thing on my plate were the biscuits. They were pretty fresh and good. But they were not the \"highlighted\" or \"featured\" items on my dish.   Grilled Cheese from kid's menu = Let's admit it. Most kids are picky. Their palletes are not developed and they love and enjoy simple things. So why in the heck is Hash House using thick cut, hearty bread on a kids grilled cheese i have no idea why. NOT KID FRIENDLY. So i asked the server if we could replace the fresh fruit that came with the grilled cheese with french fries. The answer was no and if I wanted fries, i would pay additional. Fine, whatever. I got to feed my son.  The fries came out and they were delicious. Hence why they get the one star. I ate more of the fries than I did my own meal.  Tractor Driver Combo = over cooked pancake, sausage was still pink in the middle. The eggs were okay. However severely over priced.  The whole time we were eating we kept smelling curry and could never quite figure out why. There is no curry on the menu from what I could see.  We will not return to Hash House A Go Go in the future ever.   Just a friendly tip, none of the servers here seemed to helpful. They all milled around gossiping and talking.  One even told us we were in the thier way but we were seated at our table. I couldn't quite figure that one out.",

You can when everything is a mess and there is no flavor. sigh  Ordered coffee: taste burnt/old sitting there Scramble eggs with bacon, avocado and Swiss cheese with crispy potato: They literally mean SCRAMBLE. Everything was just toss together. I like my food neatly separated. And it's not like I ordered an omelette. The crispy potato was soggy with no Flavor what so ever. Hash Smoked Salmon with sunnyside up eggs with crispy potato: The smoked smoke has such a lite tip of smoke, the potato was the same soggy and flavorless.   When it comes to food I devour my plate like a wild animal with a piece of meat. But at this place I only took a few bites and didn't want to eat anymore.   I do like that fact that the portion is big but if it doesn't taste good it doesn't matter if it's big or small.  Wasted my time and spending $30ish for breakfast. That's a No No..",

There was a lot off food but none of it was amazing. The food is like what you'd expect at a standard diner restaurant. But it wasn't crazy expensive and it came out quick for the size of our party. My wife's french toast was the best thing on the table imo.",

I think we spent a total of 3 hours here! and 3 of our orders were butchered!   I ordered the roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash and asked them to add mushrooms to it. They forgot the mushrooms, but that was the least of my concerns after they ruined 3 of my friends meals.   One of my friend's ordered Andy's Sage Fried chicken which is one the menu favorites items, and he never got any fried chicken with it! Wtf?! We told the server twice and he still never got his fried chicken....  Another friend ordered eggs benedict without bacon, because she is a vegetarian and after sending it back twice, we figured the 3rd time would be the charm and guess what it still had bacon on it.  Oh and a 3rd friend ordered a house hash as well and asked for no cheese on it, and they brought it out with a shitload of cheese on it *sigh*   We asked for those 2 meals to be removed from the bill, and even that took another half an hour to get taken care of.   I had such high hopes for this place and they failed! Such a shame, because no one wanted to waste any time eating there again after all that. Good food, kinda pricey, but terrible terrible slow as hell service.  Good luck getting what you actually ordered here! The only thing that I ordered that came out quickly was my breakfast Jameson shot, go figure.",

Important stuff-  - located in the plaza hotel on fremont, this location shouldn't be too busy  - waited only about 10-15 mins for a party of 7 around 12pm  - HUGE portions, I would say definitely share !! Unless you're a large hungry man  - prices: quite reasonable for the size around $10-$12 an entree depending on which  Service- great, super nice & friendly  We got the avocado bacon scrambled plate ( something along the lines of that) lol and it was huge, it came with a biscuit, a slice of watermelon, a slice of orange, and potatoes. I split this with my sister and it was more than enough for both of us. We asked for no onions and they brought one out for us that did have onions :( but they gladly took it back and fixed our order! Overall the dish was mediocre, nothing to special in my opinion. It might have been because we didn't try their specialties but I was still kind of expecting something super delicious.   Anyways, overall still good. Might come back to try one of their specialties!",

To start off we had a group of 5 and we were told that a table for us would be a 30-40 minute wait at 2:30pm so we were offered the bar and said okay but if a table opens up to let us know. Well two 6 seater tables opened up and no one said anything to us until we asked and were told that we would be paying two separate checks one for our drinks at the bar and another from anything we ordered after we moved to the table so we just stayed. Then my wife was trying to order the HH Big Quesadilla and she wanted it without jalapenos because she's allergic and the waitress flat out said no. Then she asked for a Texas Ranchero and again she said no and she said it's because it's in the sauce. I asked well can we get a sauce without  jalapenos and her answer was \"Uh...no.\" I was immediately frustrated and my wife just got up and left. It was frustrating because she didn't even take the time to go ask in the kitchen if they could! The food is good and you get large portions but it's not great or amazing. I'd take the time to find another place.",

When our server finally showed up she had a terrible attitude. She rudely took our order and walked away. When our food came out someone else brought it and filled up our drinks for us. She never came back until it was time to drop off the check. Terrible service on her part, but everyone else seemed okay. I had biscuits and gravy, just a side portion because their portions are huge, and my husband had a burger. The food was okay. Nothing stood out to us.

The pancakes are the full size of a plate so bring your appetite. I recommend you bring a drink with you while you wait. They also prepare some pretty good Bloody Mary's! A must try. Been to the one at The Quad and the one on Fremont Street. I recommend Fremont if you don't have the time to wait.",

Well, I was severely disappointed.   We shared an order of the sage fried chicken and waffles. My memory must not be that good, because they sprinkled corn and bell peppers on the waffles. Yuck!   I also requested some biscuits. They were really dry and tasted like they have been sitting out for most of the day.  Everything seemed to be much better a few years ago. I will definitely not ever go again the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I had their chicken and waffles and their chicken benedict that was on man v. food and it's super good!   Hash House A Go Go are known for their huge-ass portions but if you're super hungry...... you miiiight be able to finish them lol.  At this location, I had their salmon sandwich (was trying to go healthy) but was disappointed in the overall taste.  Bread was whatever, I liked the crust on the salmon but it wasn't necessarily juicy.  Just a bit dry...  I'd only come here for their fried chicken-related entrees as they are the most popular and the chicken is always tender.  First time?  Get their chicken benedict.",

I had visions of cranberries and thinly sliced roast pork and house mayo when I ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich.

We were seated under a blown speaker, which was making a terrible racket...we asked the manager for a seating change, she agreed and then never got back to us.  The food was fine, but the poor service and obnoxious broken speaker (why seat someone there?) overshadowed everything.  All of this was relayed to the contact email addresses on their web site, and no response was provided.  Solid pass on this one unless you are seeking incompetence and indifference.

But by far, this is the best breakfast I have ever had! And the service is beyond words! We loved our server so much we even took a picture with him! I think his name is John... I asked him if I could take him around in vegas with me because he was so amazing!   Like most people said, the portions are huge! I split with the person I was there with and we still didn't finish! The drinks are huge too! I got a mimosa and it had me buzzin by the end because it was a lot! We got Andys Famous Sage Fried Chicken Breast w/maple reduction, two eggs your style, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuits. But instead of mashed potatoes we got regular breakfast potatoes. The sauce was beyond words! It was a chipotle mayo, that I could have put in a cup and drank. Can't wait to go back and try other things!",

The server will ask if you want the bacon in or out - of the waffle that is - and I got in. This was such a decadent meal. Four waffles with bacon strips sticking out of them and two huge fried chicken breasts stacked on top and fried leeks garnishing this tower. This plate is big enough to be shared by two, but I dare you to take the challenge and eat it all yourself - after all, this is sin city.",

The rainbow drink tasted delicious, just like juice, and it's oh-so-pretty that we finished it pretty quickly. The Meatloaf Hash was also very tasty, moist and delicious with spinach and cheese over a bed of taters.

    "text": "I've been meaning to come here for the longest time and finally, I decided to treat myself for breakfast.  I've always heard great things about this place and wanted to experience all the feels of this restaurant!  I went up to the host desk and there were two people there, one host on the phone, and the other just staring at her. After a few minutes of not being acknowledged I had to interrupt and ask if there was a wait.  The young gentleman apologized and told me the wait was going to be about 10-15 min. He did offer a seat at the bar, and since it was my first time, I wanted to full table experience.  After 20 minutes, I was seated.  While I was outside waiting, I noticed there were many people waiting to be seated, but while I was lead to my table, the dining rooms didn't look busy at all...perhaps they were understaffed today.   The waiter I had was a nice guy but didn't bother to introduce himself. I knew what I wanted and placed my order and my ice tea came out pretty quickly.  Not too long after, my steak and eggs arrived. The plating of my food looked like a piece of art work, very colorful and very appealing.  The steak was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but I felt the steak was very thin.   The grilled mashed potatoes were good, though a very huge portion.   My eggs were perfect! Sunny side has always been my favorite.   The biscuit was pretty huge, just shy of the size of a baseball. Served with marmalade and some fresh fruit tied it all together.  The whole experience all together was ok. Nothing stood out as a WOW experience.  The food, as pretty as it looked on the plate, didn't have any flavor. The dining experience from beginning to end wasn't a story worthy experience.   The waiter and the hosts don't engage any of the customers.  Three stars is a fare gauge of my first time HH experience.   The prices are a little more higher than any other diner but it's worth paying for if the food is fantastic and the experience is high level, not mediocre.  :)",

The chicken was dry and I had to chew it for a long time just to get it down. I was trying to impress my date so I started out using a knife and fork to cut the chicken but pieces kept snapping off and shooting to the floor. That was one tough piece of chicken. The eggs,  hash and bacon were good. My date had a burger...I didnt taste it but it looked delicious.  I did eat some of her fries and they were excellent.  By the way...this was my third visit to this location. First time that I left disappointed.",

I also had some of my hubby's chicken and waffles which is a highly recommended item since its their best seller.  The waffles are stuffed with bacon..and I liked that they used sage with their chicken.  really nice crunch and batter.",

He reordered from kitchen, & it was again delivered to someone else. As the rest of us were finished eating, waiter said he would reorder again, we declined. He never got his food, he was not charged for his food. We never got an apology, no drink refills whole meal. Over all, very poor service. But, food we did get tasted great",

Coupon didn't say anything about that, and I've never heard of it. We will definitely not be going back to this Hash House ever again!

On top of that, the prices were very fair. Had one of the stuffed burgers the first night. It was good, but nothing compared to the meatloaf sandwich I got the following day to help with my hangover. Best meatloaf sammy I've ever had. On our way out, I picked up the eggs benedict. Perfect food for the drive home. My only issue was that it was always pretty crowded and we usually had to wait, avoid the problem and get the food to go.",

Service was great even though my date was extremely rude to the waitress (I would give the date 0 stars if I could).  Plates are about $15.00 each which is more than reasonable seeing that the portions would allow you to make three meals out of the one plate.  Not too fancy yet not as casual as fast food.

My husband and I both got the farm benedicts. He got the pork tenderloin and i got the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken benedict, starting from bottom to top-- spinach leaves, a split biscuit, griddled mashed potatoes, sliced tomato, bacon, fried chicken breast, griddled mozz cheese, scrambled eggs, and chipoltle cream sauce! It sounds odd but it's to die for. I don't think we even made a dent in the food it was so large. Two people can definitely split one meal, maybe even three people. I also had the old school hot chocolate which was topped with 4 huge marshmellows and chocolate sauce. Very good. The service was great and they gave you plenty of time to order. Everything looked so good it was hard to decide. The prices were excellent too especially for a Vegas restaurant in a hotel. For the amount of food we got, 15 dollars per benedict was very good. We probably had enough leftovers for 2 days. This will definitely be our first stop next time we're in Vegas.",

If you're staying on Freemont, don't bother trying any other restaurant! If you're not staying on Freemont, roll your hungover butt to a cab and GET DOWN HERE!",

The fried chicken was tender and flavorful, and their milk toast is absolutely amazing.  The biscuits with honey butter they give as an appetizer were delicious as well.  I definitely recommend that two people share an entree, or maybe get several per table and dine family-style.  We went late at night and had absolutely no wait.  Service was decent, but the food alone is why I'm giving five stars.",

My wife ordered the chicken and waffles and it was succulent and delicious. The portions are ridiculous, a couple can easily share a plate but I'm not sure you'd want to share though.  The fried potatoes were lightly seasoned, evenly cooked and tasty. The only thing that I had to do a double take on was the corned beed hash...honestly it looked more like shredded pot roast or carnitas than your typical hash. My brother in law ordered it and said it was good, just different from what he expected. Definitely check this place out.",

The BLT Bloody Mary comes with toast and mayo on the side and bacon lettuce and tomato in the drink.  It was like getting a little appetizer with the drink, I loved it.  The chicken and waffles were beyond huge.  The waffles were stuffed with bacon, what a great idea I am so trying that at home.

Drinks, apps, food, extra plates and to-go boxes (along with napkins and disposable silverware).

Not your traditional breakfast or lunch place... if you are in the mood for some off the wall dishes this is your place.",

    "text": "This place is actually not half bad, if you venture to their other locations. This particular location has a questionable? placement inside the plaza hotel and casino and is right in the corner of the downstairs, dragging in all the smoke smell and weirdos from outside.   Normally their service is pretty standard, but this location I felt was significantly slower and the staff was rude. The bar staff area especially. We sat at the counter because there was a ridiculous line, and the bartender didn't even greet us for 10 minutes. The counter is not that big, and she had help. So coming from a person who worked in restaurants, she's just lazy and probably shouldn't be working a fast paced place that counts on regulars (as well as tourists) and not being friendly or curious to customers, also a necessity.  The food itself took FOREVER to come, we had plans to go on a helicopter tour and were almost late for our pick up because it took an hour and a half to be seated, be greeted, order, get our food and bother the staff to pay. Our food was not brought out at the same time, actually my dad got his food about 20 minutes before mine. He had a huge breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes and meat, this took almost an hour for him to get. All I had was fresh fruits and oatmeal which for some reason took even longer then his food....???  Needless to say this was the worst experience I ever had at a hash house in my 6 years living in Las Vegas and I won't ever be back to this location. Even asking them for a to go box, or where my food was after an hour, or getting silverware for my meal was a hassle to them and they were rude about it. My tip to this hash house- learn how to treat your customers or you won't have any to serve in the near future- Or servers to serve since no one will tip them.",

The server was super sweet and said the boss wouldn't do shit about it, even from the start of running out of the promised cup. No discount, no free mug of another size. Nothing. A too bad so sad. For that reason I wouldn't go back. Not good business to rip someone off if your out of your advertised at the table mug. Chicken was good waffles were ok. Service was great.

My friends ordered bloody Marie's, burgers, pork chops, and chicken and waffles.  The biscuits with honey were delicious. They were warm and so soft.  When their plates came out, it was a giant portion garnished with even more food. My salad came out and it was so sad and mediocre, the toppings didn't even cover the lettuce! It didn't even have bacon on it. So I had to order a side of bacon for my meal which was extra. Today I looked up their menu and the salad was supposed to have bacon. I was so disappointed in my meal, especially when the cafe at the Orleans has an even better salad with a much bigger portion of sides for half the price. Oh and bacon isn't extra there.",

Fried chicken benedict was pretty good too, this thing is massive. Service was great. Coffee was ok. Prices were very reasonable, $10-15 per plate  All in all, great experience.",

They use the bacon waffle with 2 fried chicken breasts and leeks.  The waffle was great, but the fried chicken was boring.  Definitely needed to be seasoned better.  Tasted like they just dredged it in a little flour and fried it.  Stick with just the bacon waffle and you'll be good.  All portions here are enormous, so its a good place if you're hungry.",

My husband said No and the employee said \"That's f**ked up, dude\" and walked off. I am not a prude but I do believe in professional language is a workplace.   So two employees come to clean up the mess, One has dirty dishes in his hand. I saw it coming. I was hoping he wouldn't. But he did! He put his dirty dishes on my table next to my plate of food!

(they've even been featured on man vs. food)   we get there for breakfast and i know i need to get hash... i mean... right??? they had a million things that looked delicious, including an array of mimosas and the biggest and most garnished bloody mary i've ever seen.  we decided to start with some mimosas.... my bf had the pineapple for about a minute when we realized he actually ordered tangerine, and i had a cranberry. luckily we made the smart decision to split a meal - the portions are unreal. we got the chorizo hash with a side of biscuits and gravy and bacon.    after a mix-up with somehow being charged an additional $580 on our room, the concierge gave us a $50 coupon to be used anywhere in the hotel. so the next day.... back to hash house!  after swooning over the 1lb burgers the previous day, we decided to split again. we went with the burger that was stuffed with mashed potatoes and bacon. we added some cheddar cheese and decided to get their house salad with cucumber dressing (yum!) and macaroni and cheese and fries (which we at least shared with friends).  everything was fantastically messy and delicious. somehow we devoured 99% of the meal, minus some burger droppings.... and felt disgustingly full for the drive back to reality.",

Funky fresh options and excellent service. Bloodies are on point at 20oz and you can keep the cup if you want.  Sage Fried Chicken anything for your fried hangover fix. Waffles, Bene or the country classic which is what I had with maple reduction (bomb!!!!) and mashed potatoes---HUGE!  For a lighter option the skillet with sun dried tomatoes, artichokes and spinach was lovely and definitely easier on the stomach but still ---HUGE!  Service was on point and helpful. Walked in at 10am on a Sunday and got a table for 2 immediately. I'm sure the locations on the strip would have longer wait times but the food came out quickly after we ordered it and we were back out within the hour. We ended up walking around for a bit and then went back to the hotel to nap :)  If you're thinking about it, DO IT. Even if you have to wait, it your perfect cheat meal to splurge on in Vegas (like we aren't splurging on everything else in sin city anyways, haha!)",

The food pile is truly a spectacle in a place where quantity seems more important than quality.  We tried the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles, the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and a House Salad.    The Fried Chicken and Waffles was average.  The chicken was crispy enough, but wasn't juicy and didn't have a lot of seasoning.  The waffles didn't have a bacon-y flavor, we wished they had just given us some strips of bacon instead.  The Fried Chicken Benedict was like three separate dishes piled into one--literally stacked right on top of each other.  One dish would be fried chicken and mashed potatoes, another would be a biscuit with gravy, and the last would be an eggs and bacon scramble with spinach, tomato, and mozzarella.  With all that on one plate you can't really distinguish one flavor from another, but you can make every bite different.  The House Salad was the standard bag mix of iceberg lettuce, nothing special.  If you do want to try Hash House A Go Go split a plate with someone and come for a True diner experience.",

I had the chicken and waffles, and hubby had the bacon burger. (It's a little pricy, but you're in Vegas) Okay, what you need to know, is that the portions are HUGE. They are shareable for two. The other thing, if you think Starbucks coffee is strong- this place out does them!!!! Their coffee is high octane... And you'll be on a caffeine rush for two days, lol, if not more!  (Maybe ask for 1/2 cup, so you can add milk and some hot water) If you like black coffee, you'll be in heaven. Our waitress was very pleasant, and service was great, as always.  We will definitely be back when we're in town again. Thanks for the good eats!",

After much perusing of the menu, we made out choices, scrambled skillet with grilled mashed potatoes for me and Crab cake Benedict for my friend. We kept hearing about the world famous \"chicken and Waffles\", and saw it go by a few times.. looked very tasty.. We didn't want to be left out of some world famous chicken and waffles so we ordered one to share. Our breakfasts were delivered and were of a very respectable portions. Both were very good. Have to say that Lo-Lo's chicken and Waffles still has this place beat. The chicken was good as was the waffle, but neither were anything special..  Overall, a really nice place to grab a bite... Oh, the bloody maria's are very good (but needed a little more horseradish :)",

The host was loud but in a good way. Smiled a lot while she took us to our table. We were put in a booth along the outside of the restaurant. We were next to this glass that separated us from the casino. Worst part was how gross it was. Finger prints, mouth prints and food splatter all over it. I wanted to post a pic with this review but I really don't like those types of pictures on my Yelp. Honestly though we went early so we know t wasn't all from that day and with the amount caked on we knew it was sitting there for DAYSSSS. Maybe make it side work or a daily cleaning ritual because no guest should sit next to that while they are eating.  Our server I wish I remembered her name but she had glasses and blonde hair. Very sweet girl. A little quick to take our order. Other then that better service experience at this location than the other one. The coffees took forever which I know she probably doesn't make. It was the Caramel Latte and s'mores latte. For $9 the s'mores one MAY have been worth it but the caramel one wasn't. It was overly sweet and barely tasted anything coffee in mine unlike the other one. So kinda not worth it and had like 4 sips \"/ pretty expensive four sips lol.  The banana French toast was good. The way the cook the banana in the skin was rad. Smear the banana on the French toast with a little syrup and it's amazing. The quesadilla we had was mediocre at best. Barely any avocado in it though I paid extra for it. The cheese over powered the eggs. The tortilla part was hard and not soft so I can tell it was sitting in the window longer than the French toast.   I don't see myself running back here anytime soon. At least I gave them another shot...",

Like I said, it was okay. Ironically, they do serve machaca, so I bet it's probably pretty good since the shredded beef was good.  The biscuit and fresh strawberry preserves were oh so good... and the portion was big enough to share.  In fact, all the portions were too big. My kids' pancakes were ridiculous. It was the size of my three year old's chest and impossible for him to finish.  For the price, it was a relative bargain: 5 adults, 3 kids, $80.00. Nice.",

The food is solid, definitely not the kind of food you can eat everyday, everything is super rich and a treat.  Portions are huge, I took more than half home with me.  The real highlight was the service, which started at the host stand, with a young lady named Marcella, what a breathe of fresh air, she listened to preference on where I wanted to sit, was quick on her feet and made decisions quickly.  In addition to that she was constantly scanning the room and solving problems before they came problems, even things that I know were beyond her job description.   My server Christie was great as well, took a spill in stride, smiled and never missed a beat.  Food was awesome, service rounded it out.  I have found service and training to suffer, because there are so many hospitality positions, the labor pool is diluted and turn over is so high is hard to keep well trained people, Hash House figured it out, I'll be back.",

We had a wait but the nice this is they will text you when the table is ready so we took a quick walk down Fremont Street.  Once we were seated we were greeted by a super friendly lady who was very helpful.  Service seemed quick for how busy they are and we really enjoyed our food.  Highlights: Large portions, quick service, good food, pleasant service  Lowlights: Nitro Cold Brew coffee is a hard PASS. Don't do it... tasted watery and bland.  While I enjoyed my food they should really post the food they are going to add to the plate on the menu. I hate red and green peppers and made sure this was not listed anywhere on the menu. but when the food came out they garnished the entire plate with diced red and green pepper. I had to eat around it since it was already in the sauce.  Pro Tip: Portions are more than large enough for sharing, so save some money and share a plate.",

The reason is because the portions they serve are HUGE and it's great if you want to do family style eating, where people split the entrees and share!  There is so much food to choose from. It's a little more pricey than your average IHOP but the quality and portion is bigger. Everything in the menu is pretty much $15+, which can be a little pricey for breakfast food. Although it is a little on the pricier side, the value is there because the food is really good and sometimes it's actually cheaper to share food amongst each other via split bill, which our server had no trouble doing!  Due to its name, I thought that this place was a quick grab and go type restaurant but it ended up being a whole restaurant, and I'm not complaining at all! Service was brilliant, as drinks were quickly refilled and the server was really helpful in helping me pick out some food.   This place definitely surprised me, and I will be coming back for many more breakfasts!",

    "text": "Hash House A Go Go instantly became the \"go to\" for my girlfriend and I when we first visited Vegas, more specifically Fremont Street, several years ago. The menu features simple, mid-west style, comfort food. When was the last time you read a menu with references to Indiana?  I've come to learn that this \"chain\" originated in San Diego. Hash House is all over Vegas, but we enjoy visiting the Plaza location. If you happen to be in Reno, Chicago or Orlando, you too can enjoy their outrageous portions.  My youngest son nearly fainted when he saw the size of his pancake on a previous visit. And hands down, our favorite menu item is the Fried Green Tomato Stack. Sadly, it's seasonal and was unavailable this visit. However, we have never been disappointed by our selections.  This past weekend, we decided to make Hash House our last dinner in Vegas. We even ordered (and shared) the Hammered Pork Tenderloin. It features two giant deep fried pork tenderloins and some amazing smashed potatoes. Not to be out done, the Blue Crab Cake appetizer was deliciously moist and generous. And the molasses drizzle on the plate was practically licked clean off.  Great service, a fun quirky menu and atmosphere, and always delicious food are clear winners. Can't wait to be near another Hash House!",

The food and the service was great! The casino floor is close and they will text you when your table is ready if there is a wait. Other locations are crowded and the wait is brutal.   For brunch we had the crab cake Benedict and shared the humongous portion. It was perfect! The biscuit was delicious and we were skeptical about having the mashed potatoes instead of hash browns but as is, is the correct choice. The spicy sauce is ahhhhmazing. We also had to of the mango champagne cocktails. It was good. Very refreshing.   Service was great and on point. Surely we will be back again when in Vegas.",

It also came with a salad with 2 pieces of SOGGY croutons, which was super dissapointing. I ordered the spicy grilled chicken which wasnt super bad but it did taste a bit dry. The fries that came along with it tasted pretty good and crispy. Overall, I would go to a diff hash house a go go location.",

This place has got quite the menu and the choices all sound amazing so it takes a good few minutes to make your decision. All of the food we saw served looked awesome. The drink choices were amazing too! My Husband tried this Jameson cold coffee drink (the Frigid Irishman) and WOW, you could feel the whiskey but the coffee gave it an amazing taste. I went with a normal warm mocha and it was delicious! This food though, I just can't get over the flavor combinations and serving size. My Husband had the fried chicken benedict and it was INSANE! Almost impossible to get a perfect bite because of the size of this thing but the taste was worth every single bite. I tried the French toast \"tractor\" and it came with pecans and maple syrup.  Again, our server, John was so on top of it and probably the best server we had our entire trip to Vegas this round. This place has several other locations we found out, so we can't say they're all this good but we were impressed.",

Fast forward 24 hours after a mean night of bar hoppin' and other unmentionable shenanigans  and the Hash House A Go Go was a sight for sore eyes.  I ordered the corned beef hash with red onion w/two sunny side up eggs, and a large biscuit($14.79)  plus 1 Italian soda($4.49) The menu and portions of food are impressive. Prices good. Definitely go here the day after'.  I really enjoyed the hash browns and corned beef... the biscuit,,,, a little hard and tasteless. I maybe ate two bites of the biscuit . The rest of my plate was left clean as a whistle... as they say \" Finger looking good \"   Hash House A Go Go is located inside the venerable Union Plaza hotel. If your'e budegt minded or blew all your money at the tables stay here and eat here . There's even a Grey Hound bus depot nearby in case you wagered your car and need to get back home hobo style.",

So you don't feel ripped off at all, like at so many other places that serve gourmet food. They even serve Nitro cold brewed coffee, which is extremely rare at a restaurant.  We had the meatloaf, which was really good. It was so big me and my wife split it, and I was actually full afterwards. I wish more restaurants would serve portions like this.  Our service was not that great. Our waiter took our order, then we never saw him again until I asked another worker for our check. Some other staff member brought our food. No one ever came to ask how everything was ever. But other staff were around, and they were helpful if you flagged them down.  The main thing I didn't like is that this particular restaurant is right next to the casino at the Plaza, so it was incredibly smokey just like the casino. I hate really smokey places, and that's all you could smell here.  I would have given it 1 more star if it weren't for that.",

Massive portions of high-end tasting food is the best way to describe this place. I'm always a sucker for the chicken and waffles - the chicken is wicked tender and moist, and I love the fried leeks all over the plate. This time we tried the sausage and biscuits too, and they were \"almost Texas-good\", said my American-born husband.  Highly recommend sharing an entree, unless you're like my hubby and I who don't agree on breakfast tastes (I like sweet/savory and he's a spicy chorizo kinda guy).",

I sense that a lot of frustration may come from people who are coming in at rush hour (11-12:30) and frustrated with waiting. If you come in before 10:30 AM on the weekend, you should have no problem getting seated and served quickly. On to the food.  My wife and I ate here twice in one weekend. I had the machaca skillet one day and chorizo skillet the other. The machaca was very tasty with the beef being the star, but the chorizo scramble knocked it out of the park. The flavor in the chorizo is amazing. It's so good, you really have to be careful how much you eat because no one who's not an NFL lineman should be eating this whole plate. The portions are huge. Most people could eat half and be full. The biscuits and jellies are all fresh made and delicious as well.   The cocktails are like everything else, large. My mom got a prosecco cocktail which came in a larger pint style glass. We ordered a nitro cold brew and I'm not sure if something was off but it wasn't very dark and tasted weak. We sent that back with no issues taking it off the bill.  We had a different server each day, but both of them were consummate PROS! They were attentive, very personable and hard working servers worthy of praise.   They also have some decent happy hour promos from 4-7, but that's pretty standard for everywhere in Vegas.",

I had the Original Farm House Benidict, it was huge. I barely ate half. There was a roasted red pepper sauce instead of the usual hollidasie sauce. Not sure I will get hat one again, it reminded me of marinara sauce, more of a dinner item.   Our server Sonia was great. Constant refills and very sweet. The only issue I had was woth the hostess when we first walked up. We had to way a few minutes (I know it's horrible to have to wait) but we hungry. When she finally walked up she had am attitude about having to be at work. No smile, mad at the world attitude. (Might want to rethink her being the first face the customer sees.)  I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area.",

She brought to the food to our table and then left. We were never asked if everything was ok or even if it tasted ok. She never came back except to drop our bill off and then left again only saying I'm your cashier I'll take it when your ready.  We left cash on the table to cover the bill and a small tip.",

Waiter answered questions that we had on the menu as we contemplate various items. We had a request for an item staff was unable to provide but waiter was nice enough to joke with us when the food came.  Execution of food was on point. Large oversized and well portioned to the price of the meals. Hot and delicious were the chicken and waffles I ordered. The dish was seasoned right. Hot was the syrup. Ascetics of the dish were stunning.  Overall gold experience not the best but not the worst. Not sure what delay in getting food out. Overall good. I would come back. Nothing egregiously bad.

However, you can only be seated once your entire party is present which for a large party it is unfortunate when you have to go back to the end when you are only missing one person (we had 11 people). Another issue was that they will sit you down but they don't take your order right away even though your whole party knows what they want. The servers take your drink orders only, bring the drinks out right away, then leave and don't come back for 20 minutes. They then take the food orders, but it took about 40 minutes to get and then getting the check once we finished was also time consuming. We arrived at the restaurant at 9am and didn't leave till 11:30am so be sure to dedicate a chunk of time in your plans for this place.",

That beating organ is now like a deflated tire after roaring across a police issued spike strip.   How does Hash House a Go Go exist? Even if you're drunker than a 19th century prospector, it's still easy to feel bad about stuffing your face with the food that's served in this restaurant. Forget reading Dante's Inferno; this place is like living the third circle of Hell. Everything is perpetually slathered in gelatinous gravy, propped up by creaking pillars of bacon, or slathered with butter and pancake syrup.  But...  It's so good.   If your girlfriend is laboriously attempting to make eye contact with you, even as you ram fried chicken the size of a Buick down your throat, your brain will still refuse to emit shame. You will make her sign a disclaimer, before you enter the restaurant, that says, \"As your girlfriend, I will still love you even after your body absorbs seven biscuits in thirty nanoseconds.\"  And you know what? That obligatory story about how quantity overwhelms quality is an old wives tale when it comes to the hallowed ground of Hash House a Go Go - everything here deserves to be stuck to your incisors.   So go on and make it rain, Hash House a Go Go. In this case tears of defeat and of joy.",

They piled stuff on top of the chicken which made it soggy, the biscuits were dense and flavorless. The potatoes needed seasoning. I didn't like it at all. Asked for a side of biscuits and gravy because I didn't want to eat more than 10 bites.... And that sucked worse. The gravy had no flavor, it tasted like roux /flour and the biscuits were still hard and no good flavor. Disappointed. I had chicken and waffles years ago and liked it.",

If you like the the theme of huge portions at low prices, it's a fun place to try.  BUT, if you are a True foodie and you are looking for flavor, quality, or something that will make you lick your lips with satisfaction, this place just will not do the trick. Nothing here tastes bad, per se. But nothing tastes truly delicious or has you wanting to go back for more.  Overall, if you have a picky palate, try somewhere else. You'll just be disappointed in Hash House.",

And while the menu item doesn't sound so enthusiastic in the description, what ended up on our table was 4 pieces of syrup drenched fried chicken piled high and speared into waffle cakes, stuffed with BACON!  Bacon! Stuffed into a WAFFLE! Can you imagine that?  Some crazy shit here!  The service is slow, but it's understandable. At the time we arrived to eat here, our waitress was serving 7 tables in the early morning. She can alternate between Spanish and English (she's Caucasian), and had some unruly tables full of grumpy, whiney old people to deal with. 7 tops is ALOT of people to feed. So we had to give her credit for keeping her cool under pressure.  The atmosphere inside, versus outside the Plaza casino was just as significant as The Griffin bar on 6th street and Fremont. You have your shady fuckers bumming around and looking for change outside the casino (Fremont happens to be a major place for bums to mill about, and also is the drop off point for newly released inmates from the Clark County and City jails at the Golden Nugget valet), and then you got the more sociable folks coming inside to eat.   Security and the staff do a good job to keep trouble out, if not appearing to be overworked.",

To begin with, I was sat in a booth that did not allow high chairs, apperantly it is a fire hasard to have a high chair slightly blocking a passage way... so then why was a sat here??? We were moved to a different booth, In which the crapiest server I've had in a long time was stationed, Mandi.   We sat for about 10 minutes before mandy greeted us, by the time she finally came by I was ready to order. I asked for an Avacado burger and my gf had the brown sugar banana pancakes. To drink, we both had water.   Mandi brought out our waters NO STRAW. Don't you just hate that lol. I would have loved to asked Mandi for straws but she was no where to be found. So I sipped straw-less.   25 long minutes later, she finally shows up and lets us know she will find out what is taking so long with our order. She comes back to the table food and all. Makes me wonder if the food was ready before hand and she just then got around to checking.   The food was amazing, it was worth the wait, my Avacado burger was yummy and HUGE. My gf's banana panckaes were so good too! The food is why this place even has 3 stars from me.   Halfway through my meal, my water runs out... but where is Mandi? My lovely gf offers to share her's.   We finish eating, time to pay the bill. We wait and wait but no Mandi? wtf... I have a 2 year old with me, they get impatient fast and I have to sit and wait for another half hour, till finally my gf goes and looks for her. She finds her visibly eating in the lounge area... oh we were pissed. We left the money, an angry note to the manager.",

This place is meant to be fun, fresh, and big. It delivered for me and we came back two more times (one time was for more Budweiser in a bag)  The food was huge and delicious. Our server was slammed but he could see that we were good energy people so he made sure to keep us entertained even though he was slammed. We were drinking Hamms beer and Budweiser in a bag at 8am which was super fun and then the food came out... Well as you can see in all of the pictures, the food was huge. Lets not forget that it was delicious too!  Biscuits were warm and fluffy, chicken was moist, and meatloaf was perfectly seasoned.  I really like what they are doing here and if you are staying downtown then this is a pretty cool place to eat if you have the time or if you are super hung over",

Yelped and Man vs. Food verified that this place was worth checking out.   One dish was all I needed to vindicate this decision. A fried chicken eggs Benedict that literally could of fed a family of five. We couldn't even finish it, and I'm no dainty eater. I smiled in my best food coma face as patron after patron tried to tackle this behemoth single-handedly. If you're under two bills, don't even think about it.   Easily one of the best breakfast dishes we've ever had. Look at the pic!",

However, don't be fooled -- there is nothing special going on here.  Quite honestly, we should've left after being seated as the lady working the front had the worst customer service. Yet we gave it a chance.   Then our server -- slow as ever -- came over.  Don't worry, he didn't have ANY manners.  When someone says thank you, a simple \"you're welcome\" will suffice.   While waiting way too long to order, we heard an employee (the lady with colorful hair) repeatedly cursing.  Mostly talking about how she didn't want to be at work, with quite a few more \"fucks\" in that statement.   We will spare you the details as to how bad the food was.   All in all -- DONT FUCKING DO IT!",

She brought our drinks and walked away too fast for us to even let her know we were ready to order. We waited and waited and she never came back. One person in our party had to go find her so we could order our food. Once we ordered, we didn't see her again for a while. Fast forward 45 mins and we asked a different server about our food. He was very nice and helpful and went to find our food (Thank goodness for him!) He brought our food and made sure we had what we needed. Our server returned with no apology or explanation. Got our food order wrong, but we were so hungry we decided to eat it and ask for our check. She brought us the wrong check, but by this point we just wanted to pay and get out. When we checked our bank account after leaving, she had charged a different amount (more than what we had ordered or what our receipt originally showed). With the combination of terrible service, cold food, wrong order, and wrong amount being charged, we definitely will not be returning.",

The $5 Bacon Mac n Cheese is currently on my top 3 mac n cheeses ever! So Good!   If you're looking for a delicious relaxing place to eat that's not too crowded, check it out!

We were immediately UNDERWHELMED with the uneven table our group was seated at, the salt and pepper shakers were dirty to where we had to ask the waitress for clean items. The Waitress was awesome except she kept forgetting our togo boxes, thus we ended up leaving our food for those who wanted to take their food. The food was not good, to put it nicely. Most of the group ordered a burger, and were satisfied, some were not as their burger was bland. I ordered the bucket of chicken, and let me say the fries are AMAZING, the chicken was beyond horrible, and had a rancid flour taste, with no real seasoning. I must say we were expecting better, and it was beyond mediocre, thus if I try Hash House again I'll go to another location, but as it stands, I'm done with Hash House as a WHOLE...first and last.",

In the Plaza, the big hotel / convention center at the corner of Fremont & Main, you can find a pretty standard looking casino, but the eateries in there are far from standard.  The Hash House is a strange Southern/farm-themed restaurant that serves up biscuits and 'hash' skillet scrambles, as well as Southern-style breakfast (chicken & waffles) and comfort food. I went here for breakfast, service was good.  They wouldn't do a turkey substitution on my scramble (I got the jalapeno/chorizo version and thought it tasted pleasantly like a breakfast taco), but the serving was generous and the flavor was good.  I'd give it a thumbs up, especially for a morning-after breakfast.  If you're looking for a low-fat snack before yoga though, give it a miss.",

It was served hot and a great change of pace having shredded fresh corned beef with cheese. It's like a breakfast Ruben. The potatoes were OK, they aren't what I like. I like fresh potatoes not ones from a bag...  Bloody Mary is pretty good though!!!",

After a short walk from our hotel to the Plaza we were seated and looking over the bloody mary menu. What better way to deal with a mild hangover than with more booze. I got a BLT bloody mary. This drink comes with lettuce, bacon, toast and a mayo packet so you can make a sandwich with all the trapping you have at your disposal. The bloody mary itself wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.   The standout here is the food. We split a scramble with basil and goat cheese. Holy eff I need to be making this at home. Incredible. When I return to LV This will be my breakfast spot. Eat here if you're staying downtown. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place is okay. Not anything spectacular, by any means. I've eaten here twice, once I had the mushroom cheeseburger and the second time, today, I had breakfast there.   The Stuffed Cheeseburger: The first time I went there I had the stuffed mushroom and swiss burger and it was alright. From the name, I assumed the actual patty was stuffed with mushrooms and swiss but it was actually stuffed between two patties. The burger was huge and they cooked it well done, just like I asked for but it lacked seasoning. The patty desperately needed salt; it was very bland. The mushrooms were slightly salted, could've used more but were still actually really good. The condiments were perfect, the fries were good and the burger was HUGE.   Breakfast: they offer a breakfast dish called The Basic which include two eggs cooked to your liking, sausage or bacon (two pieces of either, we picked pork sausage), potatoes (crispy or mashed), toast or biscuit and assorted fruit. I didn't really care about the fruit or the toast or biscuit so I just ordered sausage, two eggs, and potatoes a la carte. It was a couple of dollars more, but at least I didn't have to settle for something I didn't want. The eggs were pretty good, but I would've liked the white to be set a little bit more. The two sausages tasted good but they were very pale and almost looked undercooked. I should've asked them to cook them until they were dark. As for the crispy potatoes, I guess I kind of expected more of a hash brown/latke kind of fried but it wasn't, they were more like fried chunks and they were still very tasty, salted well and the portion size was good. My boyfriend ordered the basic, with two over easy eggs, wheat toast, mashed potatoes and sausage (he asked for them to be cooked well, almost burnt so it would be crispy). He liked it; his eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage was delicious (I know because I tasted a bite of his; they were WAY better than mine which seemed barely cooked and not seared at all), he seemed to enjoy his toast but they completely forgot the fruit. He thought the mashed potatoes were alright but a little tough.  Overall, the food here wasn't bad. Breakfast was definitely better than lunch. Breakfast wasn't great for a place that specializes in breakfast. Compared to Denny's, it was like double the price for the same quality. I would return for breakfast but not for lunch, not for a burger at least. I'm sure there are MUCH better burgers around.",

    "text": "They say Go Big or Go Home, but Hash House offers everyone the chance to Go Big and Go Bland.  This place offers fun dishes, massive plates, and very little flavor.  They sell themselves as a Midwestern-American eatery.  And the menu is piled up with ginormous plates of meat and carbs in various forms (chicken and waffles, giant burger, chicken and brie sandwich, etc).  The tv show \"Man v. Food\" helped put this restaurant on the map based on the host's love of the \"Chicken Benedict\"--which consists of a layer of mashed potatoes with a biscuit, fried chicken, bacon, cheese, spinach, and eggs.  It's huge!  It's famous!  It's okay.    Every which way you turn on this menu is a dish that should be the greatest thing you've tasted--I mean there's nothing \"light\" on the menu.  But despite all the carbs and butter and fat on the menu, most dishes are simply decent.  The burger -- flavorless ground beef.  The Chicken Benedict -- surprisingly bland.  The egg scrambles -- fresh, but surprisingly plain.  I seriously want to introduce the kitchen to salt and spices.  I've eaten here several times because of friend's supposed love of the menu, but I just don't get it.  The restaurant lures customers in with the promise of indulging in \"meat and potatoes\" piled high.  They've got the quantity right, but the flavor is sadly lacking.  Bottom line: Hash House is worth a visit as a culinary curiosity.  But the lack of flavor will prevent most customers from repeat visits.",

    "text": "I ate here a few years ago at the Henderson location, and it was good.  Not great, but good enough to try again.  This time we ate at the downtown location in the Plaza hotel/casino off Fremont street.    I ordered the HH Original Eggs Benedict.  Presentation was dramatic, as usual, but the food was disappointing.  Bed of mashed potatoes were good but nothing remarkable.  Tasted like a homemade mash with little or no cream/butter and skins left on.  Then on top of that were two halves of a biscuit.  Bottom half was hard as a hockey puck.  I was about to call the waiter over to take it back but then I cut into the top half, and it was soft.  No intention of eating all those carbs, so let it go.  Tomato was under ripe and spinach leaves were cold and crispy.  Eggs were poached perfectly. Bacon was thin and just okay.   \"Red pepper cream\" poured over the top was uninspired.    My companion ordered the smoked salmon egg white scramble with fresh fruit.  Strawberries were pink and white.  Not red.  Not ripe at all.  Pineapple was good.  She enjoyed the hash, but I thought it smelled horrible.  I don't like strong fish scents, especially for breakfast.    Will definitely not be back.",

It isn't as busy as the other locations, and they are super friendly. I had friends that came into town, and they allowed them to sit down first so they could surprise me when I got there! We even had a few extra people, and they brought us another table so we had the room.  Food is delicious, but be prepared for huge portions. I was only able to eat about half of my biscuits and gravy. Did I mention that they came with mashed potatoes?! Just about all of my favorite foods rolled into one. My friend got the chicken and waffles, which got a huge thumbs up. My 4-year old goddaughter got the cheeseburger off the children's menu and it was the size of her head! Deliciously seasoned fries.  The only con was that we had given the waitress cards and cash, and asked for cards to be run first. We should have had $10 left over in cash, which would have been part of her tip. Unfortunately, she decided not to bring our change back, and we had to ask for it. Shady trick. She got tips anyway from all the card holders, but she could have had more if she just did the right thing.",

I wasn't kicking and screaming going into this place, but I was a little annoyed that I was being forced to take a break from gambling, that is until the food came.  Three adults shared the legendary Man Vs Food favorite.  I was expecting a ton of mediocre food smothered in gravy.  When the plate arrived it sure looked like what I was expecting.  Literally, this thing is the size of a regulation size football, and not the controversial deflated Pat's size either, fully inflated.  I was however extremely surprised when I took my first bite.  Each layer/component of this behemoth is actually very well made and tasty in its own right.  I didn't understand the fried spaghetti sticking through, but that was about my only question about the dish.  Three adults + one serving = still had leftovers.",
