Think of the best Thanksgiving turkey meal you have had, and then put it between two fresh pieces of sourdough bread. NOTE: Get it toasted if you are really feeling frisky. I would seriously get on a plane and fly to Vegas just to have one. The tuna is a close second (IMHO) and the Sausage comes in for the bronze medal. The 20\" is enough for two hearty meals, and a warmed up Bobbie tastes even better on the second day.",

Flavor good but definitely well,well,well done.  Called and asked   why and was told that meat was frozen and depending who cooked it you wouldn't know.  Asked for the manager and someone who sounded as if they were 15 years old said \"I'm the manager\"  and pretty much said what you ordered is what you get..  Would not do again.",

If I lived back home it would be a 4/5 stars.  Be careful and don't belly up and order a large (like I always do!). They will literally hand you a sub that is larger than your arm. I do it all the time and always know that 24\" sub (or however long it is) is mine when I see them bring it to the counter.  If you don't like steak and cheese, they have another special sub called the Bobbie. I eat these about 3 times a week during the World Series of Poker when I'm at the Rio everyday (Official Sandwich of the WSOP YO!). Roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce... don't knock it til you try it!",

They even screwed my order up once, and very kindly and apologetically made me another sandwich (and took care and time to do it like the first, they didn't hand it to me right away), and allowed me to keep the first one (which I gave to my boyfriend who loved it). The slaw be jo is awesome, and so is the cole turkey. Don't let the stuffing and cranberry keep you from ordering it, it was amazing and totally not what we expected. The Prosciuttini is great as well, some of the thickest prosciutto I've ever had. We frequent Capriotti's at least once a week. The ONLY downside is there is limited seating if you want to eat there, and they often run out of beverages in the cooler they have. Multiple times we have just walked next door to get a drink while our sandwiches are being made.",

Got my sandwich dry and then ended up going to the pizza joint next door and getting a side of Italian dressing (for 75 cents). A positive is that I got the 9\" small and it was HUGE and was like $6.99. Would I return? Eh, I'd like to try out other places instead.",

At the halfway point, I was already struggling, but being raised by a strict mom, I was not going to waste any part of this delicious sandwich (on account of children in Africa starving daily).  So I soldiered on.  By the time I finished, I was in all sorts of pain and throwing serious shade at my husband.   Bottom line, do get the Bobbie.  Order up, but make sure you have access to a fridge if you can't handle it, since there is mayo.  This has now replaced Earl of Sandwich as my new fave sandwich spot in LAS.",

It is relatively slow, but I've always been fine with it because the sandwich is so good. The last time I was there I ordered a cheesesteak (my fav) and the person taking my order said I should reconsider because a hot sandwich would take about 25 min. She suggested a cold sandwich instead. I ordered a cold sandwich then waited, and waited, and waited. I timed it. Not only did it take 31 minutes for my cold sandwich, people who had ordered hot sandwiches after me got their food. I complained and the women was so rude to me it was unbelievable. She said my sandwich was hard to make. It wasn't even what I wanted in the first place. Bottom line, poorly managed, poorly trained, expect long waits and do not complain, but at least it is a good sandwich.",

A few months back, when ordering a turkey sandwich, not the sub, but the sandwich, I was delighted by a real deli sized meal. Last week, when I ordered a tuna sandwich it was more like a bread and tomato sandwich with maybe 2 oz. of tuna. It was pathetic. It was like a \"tuna spray\" for flavoring. So last night I ordered the turkey - and again, same lousy experience. It was as if someone sprinkled turkey like a pizza topping on it. Maybe 2 oz on the entire sandwich. I had to scrape it off the huge roll so I could taste it at all. Bad experience again. No more Capriottis for me - there's too much excellent competition out there with Firehouse subs and others.",

If you're not familiar, Capriotti's is famous for serving up sandwiches from your shoulder to your fingertips (20 for $13), specifically the Capastrami which consists of pastrami, swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cole slaw.  Man-o-man this sandwich is good. I love my sandwiches with crispy bread, but Capriotti's serves it up soft and saucy. The hot pastrami is layered on the soft bread, topped with melted swiss cheese; the dressing is tangy and not too heavy; and the crispy cole slaw adds the perfect crunch to the sandwich.  I heard the Bobby is also a fan favorite at this sandwich joint. The Bobby is described as Thanksgiving in a sandwich. It consists of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  If you have money, please start your own franchise of Capriotti's in SF. I'll definately be a regular.",

I made my bi-weekly pilgrimage to the Maryland Pkwy location to get a Bobbie--  --It really is as good as you've heard. Its like thanksgiving every day, especially useful in a city that has no semblance of seasons...no fall leaves, no nippy Thanksgiving-type weather....the Bobbie is as close as you're gonna get to an authentic Thanksgiving experience in this God-Forsaken town.  Anyway. Got a Bobbie, the place was packed and I was in a hurry, ate it in my car. The sandwich was so good, I fell asleep in my car. In the 110 degree heat. Woke up ~20 minutes later, felt really sick, confused, and short of breath. I tried to stand up, promptly threw up, missed my afternoon class, and wasted a great sandwich.  It was the heat stroke that made me puke, btw...not the sandwich.  Highlights include THE BOBBIE, really excellent vegetarian options, and proximity to campus.",

Even splitting a medium is a serious meal.  Weird thing was that they had only one flavor of drink (Sprite) and limited chip options.  This happened during the school year (March), when you'd think they'd be replenishing stuff once or twice a day.   Tables outside were a plus; might move inside in the summer.",

Even though the Capastrami seems to get the most love here- and I have tried it a loved it- I prefer the Slaw Be Joe sandwich by far. Capriotti's roast beef gets missed in reviews and it is a painful under sight. It rules! It is not like roast beef cold cuts, but like actual shredded roast! SO GOOD! I get the sandwich with cole slaw and russian dressing, sub swiss for provolone and omit the mayo- the sandwich has enough with the cole slaw IMO.   Their cheesesteaks are also bomb. I wish I liked turkey because the Bobby sandwich looks wonderful.   I also like that they have Wise brand chips and Tastykakes- both from Philly (home of the best sandwiches in the world!)

    "text": "I'm usually the one who is asked for recommendations for restaurants. Because I travel frequently, I get to learn about and pass along to others some great hidden gems that might otherwise be overlooked.  While in Las Vegas for a work conference, a friend of mine came up to me and asked me if I had heard of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. I hadn't, so I was intrigued. He proceeded to tell me about this place and how amazing the Bobby Sandwich was. The detail and enthusiasm in which he spoke about this sandwich and how it was Thanksgiving dinner rolled into a sandwich made me crave it so badly that I knew I would be eating here some time during my stay.   So, that's just what I did. Leaving the Bellagio via taxi, the first stop en route to the airport was Capriotti's. I was out the door almost before the taxi stopped because I was starving (and the meter was running). I was told this was a small sandwich shop with limited seating, but it actually had more than I expected. I suspect there's a rush at lunchtime, so online ordering and carry out are both options.   Let's talk a little bit about this sandwich. I made a rookie mistake of ordering the medium - 12 inches of turkey and stuffing goodness, but way more than I could eat. Next time I'll order the small. It came to me in a paper bag wrapped in butcher paper, and it took everything I had in me not to rip into this until I was at the airport.   The \"grand reveal\" - when I sat down and gently took my sandwich out of the bag and unwrapped it was like opening Christmas presents.. I didn't know what it was going to look like but I wanted to find out right away. Before me sat this wonderful looking sandwich with stuffing layered between the chewy sub bun. Dollops of red streak across the stuffing showing me where the cranberry goodness was hanging out.   I consumed the first half without dissecting it because I wanted to taste it how it was meant to be enjoyed. The turkey flavor came though in each bite along with cranberry and thyme stuffing. Something kind of tangy also hit me, and I later identified it as mayo. While this seems strange, fight the urge to ask them to hold it because it balances the favors out perfectly.   This truly was thanksgiving on a plate and something I'm going to want again pretty soon.  The freshness of the turkey came through, and as I tore apart the second half, I was pleased to see it was real turkey... Not slices.. And there was a healthy amount. No skimping here on ingredients!  My friend, Mark, told me that he looks forward to Thanksgiving leftovers every year so he can make one of these at home, but he makes it a point to swing by at least once when he's in Vegas to pick one up.  He's made me a believer, and I'll be following in his footsteps from now on.. Making my own in November and picking them up any other time I can.  Final comment: I ate this lovely sandwich almost 24 hours ago and haven't anything else to eat yet.. And I'm still not hungry!",

Made sure to highlight this today, however it was missing. A sub par experience.  The other thing was when got rung up, had to buy my drink and cookie on separate receipt. Anyone that knows about Capriotti's reward program knows that need a $5 minimum receipt order to count as a visit. I don't care about visit per se, just that dollar account is recorded. So had to buy extra just to get over the limit.  Overall the sandwich is good and service was good though for me it's hard to overcome those two things.",

I decided on the half Bbq chicken salad and half Philly cheesesteak sandwich. I sat down text my friend, played some games and waited and waited. The friendly guy began taking a huge catering order out and disappeared.  I checked the time from when I sent my first text and it had been 30 minutes! I seriously waited over 30 minutes for my food. I heard them in the back ask if it ever got made. When they finally called my name the guy wasn't even friendly and didn't acknowledge my wait. I wasn't offered a bag of chips or free soda. Nothing!   The Philly was just ok. The meat was good, it wasn't fatty or anything. The salad was amazing! I was too hungry after the wait to take pictures. The BBQ sauce was perfect and I loved the corn and black beans. The crispy onion was my favorite. Added the perfect crunch.   Overall they would've gotten 4 stars had it not been for the service. I'll go back and get the salad again, a half wasn't enough!",

Knowing kids, I wouldn't be surprised if they were messing up on purpose so they could eat the mistakes themself. It was just too strange that he didn't realize he made the wrong sandwich until I arrived and without me even saying anything. After reading other reviews, it seems like a trend because I'm not the only one. I really wouldn't care because not my problem except...this wasn't for me. I was picking up for someoneand they were waiting...Lame. I would not recommend this location until they fix this problem.",

    "text": "Um ever had a sandwich before? If it wasnt here it probably wasnt that good... unless you spent way too much money on it. I can only think of one other place i like more than capriottis. So stop wasting your money and go here... if you are in VEGAS!!  They are juicy and yummy and tastebud orgasmic (look it up... i am no way responsible for what you find). I loved the meatball... the turkey and cranberry, and the pastrami. Holy cow... so delicious. Why a sandwich place while you are in vegas... follow me to the next paragraph and I will tell you.  Because sometimes you just need something quick. sometimes you just need a tasty greasy bite and this place offers you that guilty feeling of indulgence but... wont kill you. They just know what theyre doing and they are doing it well. The bread seems fresh bakes, the meat is tender and dare I say flavorful (that is to say well spiced, mixed well with sauces and oils, and works well with toppings, coleslaw, lettuce, etc, damn people stop saying flavorful!!!)  THE VERDICT: you feel like a sandwich. stop by capriottis, you wont regret it. you will only regret not being more italian. but hey... i cant think of any possible way for you to change your race, so... just eat the sandwich and feel that way. I'd eat it while watching the sopranos. amen and amen.",

When I first moved to Vegas, whenever I told someone I had never tried Capriottis before they would give me a \" get out of this room right now and go order a sandwich\" look. So, I can say I was pretty happy to finally bid that look goodbye.  I decided to try something I knew I'd enjoy first, before trying their \"known\" sandwiches because I did not feel like much of a risk taker that day. I opted to go with the 9 inch meatball sub. The meatball sub includes both romano and provolone cheese and marinara sauce. Simple, but delicious. The meatballs did not taste processed or fake at all. In fact, they had a great \"homemade\" taste to them that I thoroughly enjoyed. The sub filled me up and I was full until dinner time!  Next time I'm planning on trying the Bobbie. One of my co-workers ordered it and I was so tempted to switch sandwiches for even just one bite. It looked that good.",

Ok, now that that's done, get off of your butt, away from your computer, go to a Capriotti's location, and get yourself a Bobbie.  Fresh bread; turkey; stuffing; cranberry sauce.  Pure thanksgiving delight on a bun at any time of the year.  What in the world is not amazing about that?  If that doesn't sound like your bag (you giant freak of person, who the hell ARE you?), you can try one of their other specialties like a Capistrami (pastrami, cole slaw, swiss, and Russian dressing) or the Slaw-Be Jo (same, but with roast beef).  Or you can get pretty much any sub your pretty little head desires.  Some locations even deliver.  This must mean rapture is near.  What are you doing still reading?

Let me tell you.  This will be a regular stop when we visit Vegas again!  I had the 9 inch Capristrami sandwich. The first thing I noticed was the softness of the bun.  Even though the Capistrami is a hot sandwich, only the meat is cooked.    The meat was plentiful and the flavor of the coleslaw and thousand island dressing was great.  After I in hailed that sub I had to try another.  I ordered a plain cold Italian sub.  I figured I could have a bite or two and save the rest for later.  It was so good that I in hailed half of it.  I couldn't control myself!    Now I think we are clear that the food is incredible, but let me tell you about the staff.  Even though this had been my first visit to Capriotti's the people working there acted as if I had been going there for years.  I actually felt kind of bad when the girl who I paid for the meal started asking me about my day and plans etc.  I didn't expect that.   Then, after I ate half of my second sub and asked for a bag, they told me to give it to them so they can rewrap it in fresh paper and then gave me a bag!  They also informed me that they deliver to the local hotels for only a $3.00 delivery charge!  This is cheaper than room service's $5.00 delivery charge!  So, I am a believer and definitely recommend Capriotti's to anyone who likes sandwiches!",

I came here once. My friend was pretty excited to try this place out during this trip. I got the Bobbie, which is a very big Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.   I don't know about you but it makes no sense to me to put stuffing in a sandwich. It's just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy. The flavor of the stuffing doesn't bring much to the table either.   My whole sandwich came to me cold. EVEN THE BREAD WAS COLD! I suspect they premade my sandwich and just pulled it out of the fridge when we ordered. Why would any sandwich shop serve refrigerator temperature bread???  I guess if you work and live in Vegas this might be an OK lunch spot, but if you come from out of town, there are much better places to spend your appetite. Don't waste a meal here!",

I order their \"Capastrami which is a 9\" pastrami sandwich served on a roll with Russian dressing and cole slaw. I ask to have the cole slaw served on the side instead of in the sandwich, which they did. It took them a little more than 5 minutes to prepare it. Now I have eaten enough pastrami in my life to know that good pastrami has been salt cured and has a bold spicy, smoke infused flavor. Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland. Even the saltiness had somehow been leached out of it. The sandwich roll had obviously been microwaved which results in toughening up its natural soft baked texture. The cole slaw was mediocre and not particularly flavorful.  What a HUGE disappointment! Overall, this turned out to be one of the 2 worst pastrami sandwiches I've ever been served. I know that Capriotti's has now become another big multi-state franchise chain. I don't know how they managed to achieve that status by serving such a wretched sandwich.",

I planned to live off of this sandwich for the rest of the day, since I would be stuck at the soccer fields all day, and after playing three games I knew I'd be starving.  So, I ordered it without oil or vinegar or peppers, hoping it wouldn't get soggy and would be good all day.  Well, well, well, this baby lasted me the whole entire day!  And, it didn't get soggy!  It was glorious.  Thank you Capriotti's!

For their signature sub sandwich \"The Bobbie\", they simply stuff a soft roll with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, ice cold stuffing, and a crap ton of mayo. Go fatty America?!  While the roll is a better than average soft roll, I'd expect better tasting turkey to pair it with since with the skimpy amount of shredded turkey included, it tasted both salty and cold. The large amount of cranberry sauce with mayo didn't compliment it well either and the large chunks of cold stuffing just made the sandwich taste like something I threw together by accident on a drunk night.  I think the sandwich would of been far better if it was heated, but then again the heat would probably just mask the taste. People that go to Capriottis must really love having their stuffing cold or need a yearlong reminder what Thanksgiving tastes like. Perhaps the other pastrami special is better.   Head to Earl's for a flavor explosion instead, imo.",

Since I was new there and didn't know what else to get, I caved in to The Bobbie and it was frigging amazing.  Crammed between two loaves of French bread were roasted turkey, bread stuffing, cranberry sauce, and a thin slatter of mayo.  Sounds very heavy and probably can induce an after-lunch nap but it was pretty good.  I would suggest the smallest size sandwich if you're a light eater.  It's a cold sandwich but it works...all the gorging of Thanksgiving without the annoying whining relatives.   The shop itself is pretty small and located in a small strip mall just a few miles east of the Las Vegas Strip.  Being away from the strip made the sandwich pricing fair and store free of mobs of people.  It's fairly clean and the employees were very friendly and outgoing, especially if you're from out of town.  However if you do feel sleepy after inhaling The Bobbie, the Strip is just a stone's throw away.",

Gripe 1 - Why they don't take a RebelCard discount is beyond me, all the other business around here do AND the company is owned by UNLV Alum....  Gripe 2 - the absolute WORST ordering counter ever. It's about 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide so if you're short (I am not) you have to stand on your tip toes and either way you have to shout your order. It's very confusing too, when people come in they're not sure whether to order at this monstrosity of a counter or the cashier counter, there's no signs and no employee actually offers any help or direction.  Gripe 3 - it's always too friggen hot in there. Even in winter. Summer, forget about it, you're sweating your ass off - period.  So for that I give 3 stars.

Nobody is doing too much for thanksgiving in a sandwich these days. For those in Los Angeles there are a few locations to check out.",

    "text": "Okay, so listen here... I don't know what they put in that cranberry sauce but it tastes like Thanksgiving in your mouth.  It's heavenly.  It's saucy.  It has a nice bite that will leave you eating the entire sandwich even if you're not that hungry.  Upon finding out that the creperie we were dying to eat at wasn't opening for another hour, we gave up the wait and went in search of something to eat that would hopefully make us just as happy.  We stumbled into Capriottis feeling saddened with growling stomachs, but by the end of the meal were glad we chose sandwiches over those lousy ol' crepes.  Whatever you do, order something with cranberry sauce doused all over it.  I opted for the Cran-Slam Club which consists of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, ham, mayo, and lettuce sliced on white bread because they had run out of wheat that day.  I ate the entire thing.  A few months later, I tried to recreate that masterpiece and let me tell you, it didn't match up to the heavenly sandwich I had previously indulged in at Capriottis.  Needless to say, I'll be heading back because The Bobbie is calling my name!",

At that point the food would be ready at approx 11:48 excuse me? 46 mins for 2 sandwiches and a bowl of soup.

So this location comes to my mind immediately. The only concern is that it can be very busy sometimes, due to their popularity around the Hard Rock Hotel. Because of that, tables can be very messy ... Anyway, my favorite item is their Capistrami sandwich. Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw. Never ever disappointed me! Ordering is very simple. Pay after received the food. \"Beer Money\" is always appreciated and a loud \"thank you\" following afterward.  Noticed lot of changes on the menu. Now serving a combination of soup and salad, soup and 1/2 sandwich, salad and 1/2 sandwich  ... didn't try it yet. Maybe some other time when I'm not hungry enough to eat a whole sandwich. Also, the Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich is no longer on the menu. I really miss this one! That was my favorite when I didn't want to eat any meat.  I wish they bring it back, but I highly doubt it. According to their employees, the Eggplant is off from their menu a long time ago!",

I'm so glad they did it was the size of a small child LOL  I downgraded to half which was in excess of 12 possibly 14 inches long.  What made the meal and experience wonderful was the sandwich was not just large for the sake of being large.

The gentleman behind the counter was really sweet and helpful with taking my order... I had no idea what to get but he pretty much explained their menu and what their most popular items were. I'm basic so I got the homemade turkey sandwich and a cup of tomato bisque soup. My friends got the philly cheesesteak. It didn't take too long, but I was just shocked at how big the sandwich sizes were. I had leftovers from my sandwich, and I believe the large was 20 inches! Like holy cow!!

The s/o and I decided to go with what everyone was raving about and ordered the Capastrami and the Bobbie and shared a half of each to try the best that Capriottis has to offer.  Just like everyone has said, the Capistrami is so legit.  That is one sandwich with a ton of heft an a ton and half of flavor.  The pastrami was so flavorful, but what was really good was that the cole slaw just complimented the sandwich.  The Bobbie, which surprisingly was my favorite, should seriously change it's name to \"Thanksgiving Express\" because it's seriously what would be on your plate during Thanksgiving dinner, less the mashed potatoes of course, piled up in a roll.  It was delicious yet comforting at the same time.  The turkey was fresh and was real turkey, not your cold cut turkey here.  Now if someone would only open a Capriottis up in the Bay Area, that would be super sweet!  Until then, Capriottis is yet another awesome spot for us to hit up while in Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure I died and went to heaven.... I went to go visit my cousin in Vegas and we were looking up sandwich places on yelp when this place popped up.   The Bobbie is quite possible the best thing I've ever had in my life. We ordered 2 large sandwiches and one medium for a total of $30...not too bad (don't worry, we ordered for more than ourselves...maybe)!! It could have lasted us the whole weekend, but these babies are so good you'll eat them even if your full.  The Bobbie is this little piece of cloud heaven with turkey, cranberries and stuffy. It's like having Thanksgiving dinner tossed into a delightful little miracle. :)  The tuna sandwich is pretty good and they're open pretty late (probably because the strip is 4 minutes away). This place was so good, I'd even considering moving to Vegas....haha.",

Their cheesesteak sandwich is also one of my favorites.  The steak is well seasoned and the bread is always fresh.  Their Turkey Bobby sandwich is also really good with fresh turkey and cranberry sauce.  This place is definately one of my regular stops when in Vegas.",

It is seriously the best sub type sandwich I've ever had in my life.  I got the Slaw Be Jo with home made roast beef (ridiculously awesome), cole slaw, provolone and italian dressing.  It's a huge amount of food for a really good price and literally the best sub sandwich I've ever had.  It was so good that in Vegas -one of the new food capitals of the world - we went back twice in two days.  Capriottis is now a must visit first time we get in Vegas and stop by on the way home to pick up some food on the way home.  I can also confirm that Slaw Be Jo holds up on the way home to San Diego from Vegas and the next day after.    GO HERE WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

All I gotta say is, best decision ever.  Little did I know the Capastrami was going to blow the Bobbie out of the water but it did. I have a high standard for pastrami, and this was some good stuff. Thinly sliced, with cole slaw and russian dressing, this sub destroys all subs I've had in recent memory. The bread is great too, nice and soft.   Needless to say, the Bobbie was very good, it just took a back seat to the Capastrami real hard. Yes, you've heard that it is Thanksgiving dinner in sub form. I don't know about you guys, but I don't remember the liberal use of mayo at my Thanksgiving dinners. Nevertheless, the mayo doesn't necessarily hurt the sub, and I dig the sweet cranberry sauce mixing with it and the salty stuffing. To top it off, the turkey was tender and very good too.   I just might have to swing through the LA location now.",

The Bobbie -homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing (mmmmmm).  You can get something similar in Houston now, but this was my first year-round Thanksgiving sandwich.  (2)  Quality:  The beef and turkey (at least) are made in-house and fresh. Pulled meat, not packaged deli slices.   (3)   Quantity:  Even the small is big at 8\".  Forget Subway, Potbelly, Port of Subs, Blimpie's, Jimmy John's, etc....  Go to Capriotti's and enjoy a real sandwich made quickly.    Note:  Don't compare this to a traditional deli like those found in NYC.  You will be disappointed.  Just think awesome sandwiches.  It will deliver.",

If  you are a fan of thanksgiving, you will love this sandwich.  I also tried the Capistrami later in the same week, while good, not nearly as good as the Bobbie.  If you have a few  friends get a large of each and they will happily cut them in thirds for you.  I am a big eater, and the large is enough for two people, but two larges were good for our party of three.   If you live in Vegas or you are just visiting, go get one of these bad boys.

There is a Subway that is actually in the plaza that I work in, but 9 out of 10 times, I'll spend the extra 10mins waiting for the lights and crossing the busy intersection, because it's that much better. The menu of specialty sandwiches is creative and well thought out, and I especially enjoy The Bobbie, which is essentially Thanksgiving on a roll. But it's the create-your-own sandwiches that I enjoy, with a vast array of possible ingredients, the combinations are endless. The meats are all very high quality, probably Boars Head if I had to guess. I know, I know, it's only a sandwich. And you are right, it IS only a sandwich. BUT....if we are comparing sandwiches with other sandwiches, I can sing the praises of this place all day long. Note: I have only been to the location on Paradise. I am aware that there are other LV locations, but this review is specific to the LV location.",

It's a solid sandwich shop, always provides great customer service, and more importantly, created the Bobbie. I mean seriously, what's the first thing you think of when you hear the name Capriottis? Bobbie. #winning  Here's how much I like Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving week, I know that on Tuesday I have a function for work that will be highlighted by a Thanksgiving feast celebration with turkey and all the fixins', Thursday is Thanksgiving, so obviously that will be another turkeyfest, on my Monday lunch, knowing all these things I decide to give Bobbie a holla. That's how much I like Bobbie. Bobbie is da man. The turkey on Bobbie is almost always moist, the stuffing on Bobbie always has great flavor, I'm a no cranberry guy but everyone I talk to says the cranberries on Bobbie are great. My favorite thing about this specific location is the owner/manager (I think) Heavenly. She's always super friendly, keeps the line moving, and has never messed up any of my orders. On a rare occasion I may venture away from my pal Bobbie and get a chicken cheesesteak, which is very good, but pales in comparison to Bob.   It's great to see this brand growing throughout the country with some new locations opening up back east. I'm a big fan and believer of Capriottis and look forward to my next visit with my pal Bobbie.",

I ordered the chicken cheese steak and before I could even finish what I was ordering, she said \"with everything on it?\" and basically cut me off.  She did the same thing to my friend.  She never gave me the cup for my fountain drink (which 3 drinks were out of order anyways), so I grabbed a bottle drink from the refrigerator (after making sure they were the same price).   While we were waiting for our sandwiches, a gentleman in a wifebeater tank top came in.  Lisa immediately greeted him, told him since it was hot outside she was going to buy him a drink, flirted with him and also told him she would make his sandwich first.  I know that he ordered a cold sandwich, but his order came out WAY before ours did.  Lisa did say \"Thank you\", after we said \"thank you\" to her when she handed us our sandwiches.

I found that it was closed for renovations....bah.... Then today while visiting the Hard Rock hotel, I clicked on yelp and found there was one across the street.  I walked over and Yesssss! It's open.  I looked at the menu and picked The Bobbie. It read\"Best Sandwich in America\"   I dunno...I've had Seattle's Paseo and Un Bien's Caribbean Press sandwich  I'd rank this sandwich somewhere in the top 10 It was pretty good. Great friendly fast service A little away from the strip so hopefully the Sahara one will be up and running the next time I visit Las Vegas.",

I typed in vegan to Yelp and Capriottis popped up, so I figured we'd give it a try since it's cheap.  Now I've had the Bobby a million times and love Capriotti's, but this review is about this particular visit.  My friend asked about vegan sandwiches, and the guy working the counter said the veggie Philly cheese steak was vegan if you don't get the cheese.  So she ordered it.  After a bit of a wait, we discovered they made a regular Philly cheese steak, which I had a bit of since they were just going to throw it away.  When they finally made her vegan version, she tried it and wasn't convinced that it wasn't actual chicken.  He said it indeed was, but I agree that it looked and tasted an awful lot like chicken.  Was it or wasn't it?  We'll never know.",

I get a sandwich every day there which is $70 aweek and refill and allw always pay for it. This guy told me to stop because it wasn't free and I told him I knew that and intended to pay when I got my order.He got all up in my face and said there were a lot of thieves there. I don't know if he was the owner or just a manager but thanks to him I now have to fin d a new Cappriottis to get my food. All the employees that work there are great but he embarrassed me so much that that I can't go back. He needs to get some customer service training and think before he accuses someone of stealing.",

    "text": "I'm an only child from a single parent who (wisely) was only close to her multitude of siblings on holidays. My grandmother was quite the matriarch.. a chain-smoking, bulbous, overbearing woman. She did, however, hold enough power over my mother to collect us each Thanksgiving along with the rest of her children and their children. My mother and I would typically arrive in a in some sort of standard commuting vehicle, namely a car. The others, I imagine, disembarked from a very short bus and held hands in a single-file line until they were safely in the house.   The next four hours leading up the the main event was a melee of inter sibling rivalry, backhanded compliments, and empty inquiries.   All that said, I always looked forward to this annual charade. As much as my grandmother failed at raising her offspring into well-adjusted, society-contributing adults, she oppositely triumphed at preparing, baking, braising, stuffing, carving, and serving the most delicious turkey and sides one could ever ask for. For this alone I love and miss the woman.   Which brings me to my review of Capriotti's \"The Bobbie\" sandwich...  This Capriotti fella must be some sort of necromancer black magician because he has reincarnated my grandmother and put her to work in his kitchen. How else could he have duplicated her perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey? And her stuffing that is the delicate amount of moist so that it sticks together without being soggy? He did all this while remaining creative enough to throw all this goodness on a sub with mayo and fresh cran sauce to create the single greatest sandwich on earth.    Mr. Capriotti I thank you for making nostalgia available on demand anytime I want it for under ten bucks.",

If you were like me and never had it before, its basically your Thanksgiving meal on a sub roll.  [Turkey + Cranberry Dressing + Stuffing]  As crazy as this sounds it came to fruition.  My first bite into it, I was like, \"whoa, this is interesting.\"  I was definitely skeptical about it, but the ingredients complimented each other nicely.  As I delve more, I appreciated it more and fully enjoyed it.  I expected it to be a hot sandwich but it was served cold, so I wonder if I can get it warm the next time?  If you are noob and order like a medium you will be overwhelmed, stick to the small as its the equivalent of a foot long.  Trust me.  I'm not sure if I would come here for anything else but if I ever do have a crazy craving for a Thanksgiving sandwich then I will be sure to pop into a Capriotti's.",

He locked the doors and when I called on the business line he purposely forwarded my calls right in front of me . I'm extremely disappointed because I had 11 people with me in my wedding entourage .

Fuck that bald dude and his executive decisions to close when it clearly says open 25 hours. What if I wanted a bottle of water or some soup or something random . Fuck you bald guy.

    "text": "I just moved to Vegas from San Francisco, and my boyfriend and I have been poking around on Yelp trying to find decent, inexpensive eateries.  At approximately 300 people's suggestions, I checked out my local Capriotti's, not knowing anything about the chain except that people's stomachs appear to be happy post-consumption.    When I first walked in, I had a feeling it was going to be good:  I saw TastyKakes and Wise potato chips--both Philadelphia-area institutions, so I suspected that high quality, East Coast-style hoagies were at my fingertips.  I got the small cheese sub (I'm a vegetarian) and it was exactly the right amount of food if a gal is extremely hungry.  If a gal isn't, about half'll do and the rest can be jammed in her purse.  It was the first sub of any kind in a veeeery long time in which there wasn't something on or about the sandwich making it disgusting; in fact, it was totally perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and delicious, the peppers zesty, and everything melded together into hoagie heaven.  Oh, and the hours are great.  The Paradise location is open until midnight.  My only suggestion to Yelp readers is that, if placing an order for pick-up, do yourself a favor and call the (702) number on this posting.  There's another posting out there with a very different  number, and that won't get you Capriotti's . . .",

The sandwich even had mayo on it.....mayo....thanksgiving dinner....I know I'm Chinese but even we don't have mayo on thanksgiving dinner.  I will say though that the woman workin the counter who was kind of butch was very nice and had a lot of local flavor to her. she even suggested for my friends and I to get the larger sandwich to save a little cash.

So I cannot tell you if the food his great, because I couldn't bring myself to place an order.   When I parked my car, I noticed a guy sitting a one of the tables outside smoking a cigarette. I looked again, and saw that he was an employee of the restaurant, wearing a white outfit and an apron. Well, that's not the most mouth watering thing to see before going to eat in a place, but hey, no worries, the guy's a pro. He must wash his hands before going back to work, right?  Wrong. As I was walking toward the entrance, he threw his butt on the pavement and went inside through an employees door.   I entered the restaurant, looked around, and bang!, there was my man, already behind the counter with the other workers, ready to prepare my meal.   \"Hi man, what can I get you\", he said.   I pretended to look the menu, and then went straight back to my car, and left to write this review. I'm really not picky about where I eat, but that was a complete turn off. Sorry.",

We took a $12 cab ride (for 3.5 \"Vegas blocks\") just to get there and expected a sit-down diner type place.  Our taxi driver couldn't even find it because it was a small store front in a strip mall.  We walk in and it's just a counter to order at, a couple of tables.    I was actually quite pleased with my turkey, stuffing & cranberry sandwich. Real trukey.  Actual cranberries.  mmmm.  My coworker was NOT happy due to lack of atmosphere, no drink choices (only water or OJ) and the fact that there was really only 1 vegetarian sandwich and no salads (which she was craving). The other patrons seemed to all be UNLV frat boys talking about drinking.  And there were people outside smoking which drifted in... ick.  So, really good sandwich,  I can see why locals love it.  For us though,  not sure it was quite worth the taxi ride, and certainly not a good introduction to someone's first time in Vegas- who's been wooed with the glamorous dining options available.",

And if you're like me, you're not quite sure where to go, either, since you're not a local.  Enter yelp.  Yelp results showed Capriotti's was rated highly and priced juuust right.  I got the \"small\" capastrami - pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw with russian dressing -- delicious.  It's no Langer's pastrami sandwich (in L.A.), but it was pretty good.  My friend got the slaw be joe sandwich - roast beef, cole slaw, russian dressing.  He didn't like it as much as the pastrami, so I definitely recommend the capastrami over it.    I would definitely come back.  The funny thing is, I thought Capriotti's was a sandwich franchise in Vegas only (they have multiple shops within a 5 mile radius).  Turns out there's one in LA (Beverly Hills), so I drove 4 hours to \"discover\" a sandwich shop that's been here all along. ;)",

Each time service was interesting, and I'll leave it at that. I also didn't feel like the dining area was the cleanest. They do have a lot of sandwiches to choose from, and I like that there are different sizes that you can select based on how hungry you are.  On the first day I went with the Homemade Meatball: meatballs made from scratch topped with marinara sauce, provolone and grated Romano cheese. The meatballs were small and had a slightly burnt taste to them, and it needed much more cheese. I didn't like how the bread wasn't toasted and quickly became soggy. I wouldn't order this again. On the second day I had the Homemade Turkey sub. This sandwich was worlds better and the turkey is the way to go because it is roasted and hand pulled. It reminds me of a Thanksgiving turkey, no deli meat here. The hot peppers and oil really completed the sandwich, giving it tons of flavor, and upon returning I would order it again.",

This most recent time I had the Italian meat sub. I should have asked for more lettuce as there wasn't a lot on there and I really love lettuce. But, no biggie. Also, do note the sizes of their subs. A small is 9 inches! This makes a large enough for a small army. We usually end up sharing even a small unless we are ravenous. They are open 24/7 which is awesome. A lot of their sandwiches are interesting combinations. I know I will be back at some point.",

I had heard whispers and chatter about this place for years, but never took the plunge until my best man (I knew I picked the right man for the job) pulled the trigger and made it happen for us.  Best. Choice. Ever.  We ate here twice during our 2 days in Vegas. That's how freakin' good this place is, considering the plethora of good eats choices the city has.   Seriously, do you go to a seafood restaurant and order the steak and complain because it sucks? I don't care if their other sammiches aren't up to par or whatever. You come here for the Capastrami and the Bobbie because those are their marquee items, right?  Capastrami: Their bread is soft, pastrami is thick, yet tender, cole slaw is tangy and creamy with that Russian dressing. Between the 2, this sandwich wins, hands down.  Bobbie:  The turkey is moist, the cranberry sauce is not overpowering, and the stuffing is the glue that binds everything all together. Thanksgiving dinner in a bun.   Get the large, ask them to cut it up for you, then split and enjoy with your friends. That's your best bet in terms of food to money ratio. For sure, one of the few places in Vegas you'll come away a winner every time.",

Being it's a Turkey sandwich with Cranberry, Stuffing, and mayo,  I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich but to my surprise, it was served cold.  Nonetheless, it works. The Turkey was perfect with a nice taste and texture. The stuffing was flavorful and served on a fresh roll.  BTW: s small sandwich is not so small. I ate at around 12:30 and really couldn't eat the rest of the day. It has to be one of the best deals in Vegas for around $7,",

The sandwich has a special place in my heart. Coming home after school or from playing in the park my mom would sometimes bring home this magically, ADDICTIVE wonder known as the Bobbie. This wonderful sandwich, that has shredded turkey, mayo, cranberry sauce and STUFFING, is just plain and simply AWESOME.  Yeah, now that I reside in SoCal I could get it from one of the local shops here but it just doesn't feel the same to me. It has to be in Vegas and this location for the flashbacks of said childhood to occur.   Yeah, I've been known to fly to Vegas for the day just to get me some. UMAD? Yeahhhhhh UMAD!",

Containing a ton of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and some mayo, each bite of the sandwich was like a nostalgic taste of thanksgiving. The stuffing was well seasoned and there was a generous portion of ingredients.

Whenever I'm hit with that craving and don't feel like making a Tofurkey sub at home I head to Cappriotti's.  This location is conveniently near the Hard Rock and the UNLV Intramural Fields. On a busy day the parking lot can be crowded, but there is usually space in the back.  The service itself is good and the employees are polite. Sometimes it can be slow, especially if there's a crowd. There is a TV that has been playing sports every time I've been there.  I can only rate the veggie sandwiches, and they are delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey is my favorite, and if you like coleslaw on your sandwich you'll probably love it. My meat eating accomplices swear by The Bobby.  On a couple occasions they have run out of a specific type of veggie meat, but they were more than happy to make substitutes.",

As a vegetarian, I'd say their sandwiches are amazing. Veggie cheese steak is my favorite (take it to go and add Famous Dave's Devil Spit bbq sauce to it, trust me). The veggie cole turkey is awesome too, just tell them to go easy on the mayo, they drown it. The veggie burger sandwich is a garden burger patty, good if you like garden burgers. You can also order the bobbie with veggie turkey. It's worth the $2 more than the subway across the street, that's for sure. They also sell really good chips, I'd recommend the Walker's Honey BBQ. Writing this review makes me want to order a sandwich right now!!",

I really didn't know what to expect because my wife had mentioned this place to me before we came out here....and she had it on good recommendation that this was the ultimate sandwich spot to visit. The situation was funny too because we only ended up going here because we wanted some lunch and planned to go to Serendipity 3 on the STRIP....but i wasn't going to spend 30 dollars for lunch.  So my wife remembered what her cousin had said about this place...we put the address in the GPS....and off we went. It is less than 5 minutes from the strip....and trust me you won't regret going there. People say the \"Bobbie\" is the sandwich to have but i had the Chicken and Cheese with onions...hot peppers...and sweet peppers....size medium....and WOW. Simply one of the best sandwiches i have ever had.   Here is the Best part....we got 2 sandwiches for about 17 bucks....and on my receipt i there was an online survey that you take and you get 3 bucks off your next sandwich. I am going back tonight and get me another one...that is just how great this place is. So if your ever in Vegas and want a great sandwich at a great price.....run don't walk to Capriotti's . Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends.",

You get to pick between white and wheat bread.  You pay when the order comes out.  I was shocked how big a small was.  it's like a footlong!  The sandwich itself had a different taste to it, but it was good.  Not sure how to describe it but it tasted like a mesh of food blended together.    When we were there they had free coffee.

Not taking away anything from Capastrami, it had so much meat in it that there was little room for the condiments :D  The place looks spick and span with a iron-chef type kitchen look (that's just what I thought of it). But it just adds to the experience, and these guys really put a lot of care into making your sandwiches. Customer for life - now open up some shops in NY will you? :)",

The pastrami is so juicy and really flavorful. Perfect amount of seasoning, not too salty like a lot of pastrami shops. They also throw in some Swiss cheese, which melts with the hot pastrami. I love love love their cole slaw they put in the sandwich. Its really creamy and a lil sweet to contrast with the flavor of the pastrami. The Russian sauce (Thousand Island dressing?) compliments the meat and slaw well too. I don't know if it was because I was drinking outside by the pool all morning or what, but I probably could have finished most of that \"large\" Capastrami in one sitting. It was so good! Thank god, I went to the pool prior to eating this... Or else it would not have been good for my bikini body! Haha",

Went on yelp to find their number since their website only lists the address and no phone # (wth!?)... Saw that they deliver!!! Called the store, they said another store was actually closer to our hotel. Called that store and they said this store was closer. Called this store back and they were like \"Oh they won't do it huh?\" At this point, I felt like I didn't want to give my money to a business who didn't appreciate me. But I really wanted a capistrami!  So we placed our order over the phone, was told there's a $3 delivery charge. I'll pay you $10! cuz it'd cost $20 round trip for me if I had to cab it over. Then they asked for our delivery address... we're at Monte Carlo, room ... \"Wait you're guest at the hotel? We can't deliver to guests, only to workers, per the hotel policy\" UGH I want my sandwich!! Fine we'll come pick it up. I wanted to write a 1 star yelp review but I was too hungry to concentrate.  When we got there, the guy helping us was so apologetic and gave us a free sandwich on top of our order. And that 1-star review I originally drafted is a thing of the past. Yes I'm Asian, free stuff = more stars on yelp. But yes, their sandwiches are freaking delicious so they never deserved 1 star anyway. I was just hungry and cranky.",

The Italian has a good mix of premium italian meats which were not too salty.  For the Roast Beef, I got all of the fixins' to include sweet peppers, onions, italian seasoning and oil & vinegar.

They might get confused here and there (they messed up a few orders) but you'll get whats yours and it will be pretty darn tasty.

When I took the sandwich out of the bag the wrapping was oily, but when I took my first bite I realized that this sandwich was the driest thing I've tasted all week. The bread was soft how I like it, but the turkey was crumbly dry. It had potential to be a decent sandwich if they added some, (or some more mayonnaise) and some mustard. Any kind of substance that would make it moist. Which led me to question, how was the wrapper so oily when I took it out of the bag? I don't think I want to know. Maybe they're better known for their specialty sandwiches. But not for a turkey sandwich.",

    "text": "Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has always and will always be the legend of the best sandwiches! I have been coming here for over a decade now dating back to when my family decided to move out to Las Vegas. This location was on my radar being that I was on a stay-cation across the street at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.   One night my friends and I were hungry after so major gambling and drinking so we decided to eat something outside of the choices that the hotel had to offer for us. Of course I was left with the duty to find us all something to eat so what did I do? You got it.. pulled my phone out and used my most trusted resource.. YELP!  When we arrived on a late Saturday night to our surprise there really wasn't much of a wait! Score! My taste buds were pushing towards an old fashion Philly Cheesteak so I went exactly with that. Everything on it you know grilled onions, peppers, mayo the usual. I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish the monster size 14inch sub so I took it a notch down to the 12inch. One thing I've always appreciated was the decent pricing that they offer on all of the sandwiches! While waiting on my sandwich I held a convo with the cashier who was super friendly and really provided great customer service.   Listen, when you couple great customer service along with great food.. that's a 5-star type of visit! Subway what?! Nah it's all about Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!",

    "text": "Where Hard Rock and UNLV territory converge stands another Las Vegas icon: Capriotti's. Where the Hard Rock to the west celebrates rock and roll and UNLV to the east celebrates the Rebels, Capriotti's celebrates award winning sandwiches. Since the first Capriotti's opened in Delaware back in 1976, there Bobi sub has achieved \"Best sandwich of the year\" on numerous occasions. Locally the rewards would keep on coming. In 2016 \"Desert Companion\" readers voted Capriotti's as The Best Sandwich. In 2015 the Las Vegas Review Journal voted Capriotti's Best Fast Food plus Best Sandwich. Now on Saturday, July 8; I voted to eat at this very Capriotti's.     What is seriously missing in the Hard Rock Hotel is fast food restaurants. If you are up for fast food in the Hard Rock, you are literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. With the exception of the brand new Dunkin Donuts you are left to leave the hotel and walk to the crossroads of Paradise and Harmon where there are a cluster of restaurants. One of them is the Capriotti's in the CVS-anchored plaza at the northeast corner.     Being at the crossroads of the Hard Rock Hotel and UNLV it is a 24 hour Capriotti's. So, if you ever want a craving of the Bobi at 2 a.m., or are going cold turkey for a cole turkey late at night; this location will satisfy it.     I was impressed with the service, food, and price. After presenting the friendly cashier with $11 and change, my medium (12 inch) Cole Turkey and fountain cup were ready. Considering that this location is at the eastern boundary of the Resort Corridor, they do not price gouge. Before sitting at a table beside a brick wall, I filled up my cup with Dr. Pepper from the Pepsi fountain. I could not help but notice the Rebels pictures and that they sell Wise potato chips.     Capriotti's mission statement reads: \"to share our passion one sandwich at a time.\" They have a generous way of sharing their passion. Their medium sandwich was gigantic. I could only imagine how large their 20 inch large sandwich is. They share their passion one sandwich at a time through quantity and quality. I am a fan of the Cole Turkey. Why wouldn't I be? According to the official Capriotti's menu, they slow roast a Butterbowl turkey. This savory turkey is joined with cole slaw, Russian dressing, mayo, and provolone cheese. Capriotti's slogan, \"Extraordinary since 1976,\" best summarizes this Cole Turkey experience.",

Only 24 hour location was Harmon and Paradise. The cashier was very nice and friendly. The person making our Tuna sandwich was not. He must have been high on drugs. We asked him to cut it in half and wrap it separately. We also asked for pickles on the side.   Got home, the sandwich not even edible. The bread was so disgusting and soggy. The pickles were not there. He gave some relish that spilled in the bag. The tuna was obviously old because it was so watery. I will never visit this location again. Ironically my husband knows how much I like Capriottis and the next day he went to our usual location and everything was perfect. Please help this location as it is giving Capriottis a bad name.",

    "text": "We recently catered a work lunch with Capriotti's, so I was able to sample a variety of their offerings.  Roast beef, italian, meatball were all solid and reminiscent of other great deli sandwiches I have come across, and their famous \"Bobbie\" sandwich, which is pretty much Thanksgiving wrapped in a roll, uses top notch turkey along with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.  But the sandwich that really blew my socks off was the Capistrami:  The Capistrami is pretty much what must have resulted when Mr.  Reuben  got it on with Miss Memphis Pulled Pork at Club Sandwich (sidenote: my latest theory on the origin of the enigmatic middle slice of bread in a club sandwich is that it actually represents two sandwiches hooking up, why do you think the other famous sandwich with three slices of bread is called the Big Mac?  Coincidence, I think not!) and conceived a baby consisting of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw.   Throw in some heat with their spicy pepper relish and your taste buds won't know what hit them.  Whereas the Bobbie allows you to experience Thanksgiving year round, the Capistrami allows you to experience New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day all at once...i.e. gustatory FIREWORKS!",

Maybe their other sandwiches are good but they don't look all that appetizing and with the first experience, I'm not stoked on finding out.

After a recovery nap, my friend and I ordered a 9 inch Capastrami (hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw) and a 9 inch Bobbie (homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo) to share. The two sandwiches came out to about $18, including a $3 delivery charge (which is likely much less than what a taxi would've cost) . It took about an hour for our sandwiches to arrive (they promised \"an hour or less\" on the phone).   We initially called the W Sahara branch, but contrary to their listed Yelp information, they don't deliver (someone should fix that, unless they lied to me).  I think the Bobbie is my new favorite. Minus one star because the sandwiches weren't as good as I remember. Maybe it was the one-hour delivery wait? Still, I'll continue to campaign for a Capriottis date every time I find myself in Vegas.",

This location is right across from the Hard Rock Hotel and is nice and clean with plenty of tables if you want to dine in. They are most popular for their signature subs: The Bobbie and The Capistrami. I'm not much of a Pastrami person myself so I always order the Bobbie(turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo). Its literally like Thanksgiving wrapped in a nice sandwich. It is served cold but the bread is soft, kind of like a bigger longer french dinner roll? The turkey is fresh and cranberry sauce is not too sweet so it complements the stuffing and turkey well and the stuffing is def something different.. they all combine to make an AWESOME sandwich :) I really want one right now...at least they opened up new locations in Beverly Hills and Encino for all of us in LA county :)",

    "text": "I rounded out my Vegas trip with a stop here. The bread rolls are made fresh at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three sandwich sizes: small (9\"), medium (12\"), and large (20\").  The original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the \"Bobbie\" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.  As much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20\" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20\" sandwich without any problems.  I'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich.  I'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options.  Great service and a friendly feel overall. They say you'll \"feel like part of the family every time you walk in the door and walk out with a smile.\" Mission accomplished.",

With stuffing, pulled turkey, and cranberry sauce; it presents a sweet and salty taste that has great balance.  The meatballs are excellent as well. Not dry, but very moist and loaded with tasty marinara. I would also highly recommend the grilled italian, as it contains many different but complementary flavors with the Italian meats, cheese, and hot peppers. Overall a great place to go.",

Apparently, we weren't the only ones with that idea. The place was pretty busy and it did take a little while to get our orders. I can't fault Capriotti's for that. It's a free sandwich after all.  We ended up taking our small Bobbie and small Capastrami to go. We split half of each and it was a delicious way to cap off a Rebel win. Capriotti's never disappoints.",

For the most part my order is always spot on, and if its not, whatever the reason may be, because they are pretty busy all day/night long, but they are always sincere, and quick to fix the problem.   And no matter what time we go in, theres one worker, Will, who seems like he is always there, and always working extremely hard, and in my opinion his cheese steaks, are the best of any capriotti's i have been to!   If i could give 10 stars i would.",

This review is base off the breakfast sandwich I had. From the pictures you can see how messy it is! The bread was super soggy and it all fell apart making it not easy to eat. I was very disappointed since I was expecting it would come out like any other sandwiches I had order in the past. I would skip on their breakfast items.",

We ordered a roast beef, a veggie, and a cheese steak. Some of the best sandwiches we'd ever had. It wasn't until we'd ordered that I realized their specialty is whole-baked turkey. Wish I'd gotten a turkey sandwich. The place was so good I actually looked up the franchise information.  And, these sandwiches were HUGE!  We've only been there the one time, so I can't speak to consistency, but we will definitely be returning on our next trip.  Highly recommended!",

A 3rd party will pick it up at random. Door dash got it for us and the girl texted me right away and said no soup today. And she can't refund the money since I paid on Capriott's website. I called the restaurant and they said it's doordash issue. I sent email to door dash and they said it's the restaurant's issue. I've sent emails to Capriotti's.

    "text": "Stopped in to try this little spot based on Yelp reviews. We got there about 11:00 am on a Sunday and no one one was there. We decided to go ahead and try. Two guys working. One cooking the other doing the other stuff.   I ordered half a sandwich and half salad. Let's start with the salad. It was a really nice size for a half. I couldn't eat all of it. I choose the make your own toppings. The guy read a list of items and I said yes or no. Everything tasted fresh verses bagged stuff some places use.  Will order again.   Now for the sandwich. I got the cheesesteak, with onion, hot and sweet peppers and added mushrooms for an additional cost. The meat and topping are all diced and cooked together. Which made it easy to maneuver with out peppers and onions falling out every other bite. The cheese was then melted in so well that the taste just blended. It was on the softest bun I think I've ever had.    My husband who can be a picky eater even loved his cheesesteak noting the bread as well. I will have to say on this visit to Vegas this was my best meal. Even better than the steak downtown. Would most definitely try it.   Only down side was place is small and the line was out the door by the time our food was prepared. We were going to sit outside but the tables and sidewalk were dirty and in need of a good scrub down. We opted to go to a park and have a picnic which was perfect.",

Once the line slowed down, i went to the cashier went to grab my sandwiches that have already been sitting on the line for a while.  They messed up 2 of sandwiches sizes and the order, and i had to wait for them to remake for another 5 minutes.   There were other people in the restaurant have been waiting for their order for over 20 plus minutes. It seems like just an off day for the restaurant, the lines cooks are just not getting things together. The cashier however was very genuine and apologetic for the mess up and the wait.

My curiosity was piqued by the \"Bobbie\" - a thanksgiving themed creation of \"Homemade Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo,\" but then I spotted a slightly more familiar combination of ingredients in the signature Capastrami Sandwich - Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw. Loved it!! Delicious and slightly messy, the Combination of bread, meat and tangy sweetness was just right for my lunch cravings.  Tip for first-timers: They take your order first and ring you up when it's ready, so just waltz up to the counter where the chips are see the friendly sammich-jockey there to order.  Oh. And size does matter: The \"small\" Capastrami is easily 10-12\" and was plenty for me! The large must be a colossus!!",

Just east of UNLV, this Capriottis is located in one of the busier shopping centers right off the strip. As one of the few 24/7 Capriottis, they get alot of traffic from tourists around the area. The dining room is small and easily gets crowded during lunch. Thankfully the staff has always been friendly and works quick. The sandwiches here are just like the other Capriottis in town: delicious. Due to its great location, this Capriottis always seems to get pretty busy. If your not dinning in, I strongly recommend calling in your order.  The menu features a wide selection of hot and club subs. Big shout out to them for making an excellent Tofu/Turkey sub making Capriottis a great spot for vegetarians as well. Check out my persona favorite: The Bobbie, their signature 'Thanksgiving Sub\" complete with turkey, cranberry, mayo and stuffing. Though it may seem odd, definitely worth a try.",

The bread here weak and let's face it, the bread is the foundation of a sandwich. The meats are fine (not great but acceptable). The selection is quite limited. And as for those specialty combination subs, umm, they border on gross. The Bobbie?! Why not just pour the contents of a garbage can onto some Wonderbread... same taste.  This place is a local favorite because you get a lot of bang for your buck. Fat boy paradise! But when it comes to quality they are average at best. I'll give it to them, they brought a mediocre east coast sub concept to a place where people don't know any better.   If I were to recommend anything here it would be either the Cheese Steak or the Italian. Skip the meatballs. They are 80% bread. The roast beef is over cooked by 3 or 4 times, dry, flavorless.   I give them 2 stars because the folks behind the counter are very nice. Yes, they are better than Subway.",

I went ahead and tried the bobbie which everyone raves about. It's pretty much a thanksgiving sub sandwich: turkey, cranberry, stuffing. Sounded good, but not amazing. After my first bite, I was in love. The turkey isn't just regular turkey breast, its a mix of pulled white and dark turkey meat and they put a good amount of mayo which pairs well with the delicious stuffing and cranberry sauce. YUM! I had to buy an extra sandwich for the road because it was that good!",

The vicinity was small and a bit awkward since I stood at the register, but the cook asked for my order behind the counter. I tried the  Bobbie and the boy tried the Capastrami. We both got the small size which came up to about $15. Kinda pricey but what the hey! It's Vegas right? Ahahahaha  We were first going to eat at the shop, but decided to take our sammiches back to our room at the hotel across the street so we could have some sweet tea and chips as well as tv.   Both sammiches were delicious AND filling so I was glad I got a small. I wish Capriotti's was available here in SJ so that I could try their other yummy creations.",

I was disappointed after the first bite as the sandwich was cold, the bread was cold and soft.  Tasted just like unheated leftover Thanksgiving food.  So after a disappointing bite, I placed the sandwich in the toaster oven for 10 min.  The sandwich tasted so much better after being heated up with the bread warm and slightly crispy.  This is where my 4 stars come in.  If I didn't heat up the bread, I would probably give 3 stars based on taste as it came from the shop.  3.5 stars?  UPDATE:  I've been back several times and tried the Capistrami and Cheese steak sandwiches.  I absolutely love both BUT only after first putting them in a toaster oven for 5 minutes to make the bread lightly crispy and warm.  They're really delish fresh out of the oven but that's not how it is prepared when you get them at the restaurant where the bread is soft and cold.  Upgrading it to 5 stars.  I would knock off half point if I can mainly for not heating up the bread.",

My favorite sandwich is the  Slaw Be Joe sandwich, which is made with roast beef.  It  isn't roast beef cold cuts, but real shredded roast beef and its amazing.  The sandwich comes with cole slaw, cheese and Russian dressing.  They also have another sandwich made with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  It's lunch and dinner all in one sandwich.  Oh man just writing about it has me craving one.  If anyone is stopping in Vegas please feel free to bring me back a sandwich.",

It doesn't hurt to go on a Sunday and get a bit of show from the people hanging out around the Hard Rock.",

I'm so glad I walked inside as the sandwiches are amazing!  I ordered a large (12 inch) Capistrami sandwich which came out to $8 or $9 but it was sure worth it.  They put a good amount of pastrami in the sandwhich which tasted great!  The only downside for me was that there was too much Russian dressing but it was also really good but kept globbing out of my sandwich as I ate it.  My friend got a roast beef sandwich which also looked great too.  I definitely will be coming back here when I return to Vegas next month, and yes, I'll be staying at HRH again!!",

It is not a cheap lunch, is you're a broke college student like me and cheap means using the \"Buy one get one free bean and cheese burrito\" coupon for Del Taco. It usually costs about $20 whenever I go (with one other person).   GREAT FOR VEGETARIANS! - I love their veggie cheese steak and veggie cheseburger - and even non-veggies think it is tasty, too!! Veggie sandwiches do take a bit longer than non-veggie ones. It's annoying to never have hot sandwich options at a sub joint, but Cappriotti's goes beyond what you'd expect and doesn't make you feel like you're compromising taste by not getting meat.   Everything is cooked to order, but I don't think I've waited more than 10-12 min. even when it was rush hour.   I keep wanting to try everything on the menu but I'm addicted to my usuals!! I give Capriotti's five stars because it has never disappointed, and exceeds expectation. This is my go-to spot for a \"splurge\" lunch.",

Unfortunately I drank too much to stomach more than half of my sandwich.   Nonetheless, the sandwiches were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the capastrami and I ordered the slaw be jo. The capastrami was pretty delicious but still on the dry side. The slaw be jo sandwich had roast beef and coleslaw. It was alright. I've had better sandwiches. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't even toasted. I may have made the mistake of not ordering \"America's favorite sandwich\" the Bobbie, but I just wasn't sure if I wanted thanksgiving in a sandwich. I will have to come back and try it again.  As for service, the guy at the register was nice enough. There were drunk people outside so he may have been irked. My only complaint was the tables inside were pretty dirty. Seemed like no one was cleaning up that day.   Overall, food was alright.",

I only got the Bobbie (like others have mentioned, it's basically Thanksgiving ingredients in a sub). I liked it overall -- I felt like there was a touch too much stuffing, though. But I'm not really a stuffing kind of person initially, so that might be why. I LOVED the cranberries in there; just the right amount of sweetness to offset the turkey and stuffing.  I might drop by here again to try to Capristrami sometime. :-)",

    "text": "We used Capriotti's for our corporate retreat and there are a few glaring reasons as to why I would never choose to use them again.   First the good: While trying to set up our 2 days worth of orders online the system would not allow me to confirm my purchases so I had to call the location to do so.  Brandon was EXTREMELY helpful and patient and easily set up our orders with no problem.  I felt confident upon hanging up with him that our order would arrive just as dictated.   Capriotti's food was excellent! All of us enjoyed the subs, salads and cookies/brownies we received.  I was worried the food would not be enough but in the end we had more than enough for our 45 person event.  We could have actually ordered less food but the leftovers did not go to waste.   Now the not so great : Our event was at UNLV and all of us had flown in from around the country. This meant that not only did we not know the exact location of our classroom in relation to the parking/loading zones but we did not have a cart or dolly at our disposal to use for catering.  When it comes to catering one would expect a local, long established deli like Capriotti's to know where they are going and also to have the necessary equipment to make the delivery process as easy for their client as possible.  Not in this case. For both days.   First delivery day : Our classroom was on the 2nd floor and about a 6-8 minute walk to the parking lot. Our delivery driver did not have a cart.  He carried two large bags holding 50 bottles of soda and made one trip to our classroom. I carried multiple bags and on the 2nd trip out had 2 of my coworkers come assist me in grabbing the trays of sandwiches we ordered. I would like to point out we paid him a $70 tip (20%)..he was paid this even though the majority of our catering was carried in by us. Uh..yea.   Second delivery day: A classroom change meant that our room was now in a different part of the campus and that the loading zone was actually right outside the back door.  I called the store to tell them of this change and had to deal with some girl chastising me for \"her delivery driver having to walk a long distance and up multiple flights of stairs to drop off all our catering\".  I enjoyed setting her straight....no, WE carried the majority of our order in and how unprofessional to be providing catering yet have no cart and how ridiculous it was to expect your customers to provide one for this purpose.   Needless to say this clerk was extremely out of line and also had no clue as to what she was talking about since her delivery driver was a liar.   When our food came that day our driver carried in..surprise, surprise, NOTHING...thank goodness I had 2 coworkers come out with me to help..since I figured that would be the case.  He still got a tip though -- this time $50  on the same amount that was delivered the day before. I made the decision to reduce his tip but since it wasn't completely up to me I still had to give him one...It it has been up to me he would have received $0.  What did he do? NOTHING.  Add to it that although we had the exact same orders both days it was only on day 2 that we received small tubs of condiments (mustard, mayo, pickles, etc) for our sandwiches.  That was a little annoying.   Overall Capriotti's has great food and the catering is perfect for large crowds but the delivery driver is AWFUL.  Not only a liar -- as I found out when the clerk relayed his story of delivery to us from day 1 on day 2 - but if you are hiring a restaurant to cater they should at the very least bring the food in for you.   For those reasons alone for any future corporate events in Vegas we will be skipping using Capriotti's and I highly suggest anyone considering their catering do the same.  Well unless you happen to have a cart lying around to bring your food in or you feel like tipping someone for doing very little.  That's up to you.",

I think alot of people are regulars and people that work in the area.  We all had subs...meatball and roast beef. My 3 boys raved about the meatball subs. I had roast beef with cole slaw, but it seemed to have more slaw then meat.  The workers were all friendly and helpful and the only reason i am giving it 3 stars was because of my sub and the bathrooms were not in the best of condition.",

Make sure to come really hungry because not only do you get a huge sandwich, but it comes with chips as well.  I would have wanted the sandwich warm.  From what I remember, it came cold.  You can take your food on the go, eat there... You'd probably want to save half for another meal - something I should have done.  They had a pretty good selection of sandwiches... I'll have to check out this chain restaurant another time if I run into it again.  The service was quick and it's better than your typical Subway sandwich - the flavors are way more complex.",

I ordered a home style turkey with no tomato or mustard, the cashier repeated my order took it step by step, then was the same person that made my sandwich and put tomato on it. It was always soggy by the time I got home. There's a difference between mis reading something or looking over it and just not listening. This location needs to listen more .",

The Bobbie was a revelation when I first tried it and it hasn't lost its luster. However, I would love it even more if it had a touch of gravy and if the turkey came hot.  Not in the mood for a tryptophan-laced meal? Try their cheese steaks. The hot peppers really add a kick to the spice factor.

Luckily for us, right next to the pizza place is Capriottis! I saw my buddies walk in with two long subs. Initially, I was going for the pizza until I found out they got a Cheese Steak! So, I decided to try it and oh man.... it was amazing!  The bread was perfect and the sandwich was filled with delicious steak cooked to perfection, melted white American cheese, mushroom, onions, and hot peppers, which gave it an awesome kick!  Always, always, always add the mushroom, onions and definitely the hot peppers. You will not regret it! Everything was perfectly melted together and the taste was Mmmm Mmmm good! I couldn't stop with one bite or just a small portion. I'll just say that we ended up going back to get more the next day.  The service is awesome here and the guys are really awesome. That's always icing on the cake when the service is excellent. Also, this place is open really late. So, if you have the late night cravings going on, check them out and you'll be able to get your fill from Capriottis!",

The order for a hot grilled hoagie should always be: 1. Bread 2. Cheese (melted) 3. Meat slices  4. Lettuce, tomato, vegetables (cold and crunchy)  NOT bread, then melted cheese with hot soggy lettuce mixed in, then meat on the inside. Ridiculous!  The past three orders I have requested only extra lettuce. Each and every time I have gotten what appears to be a much less than average portion of lettuce.   Also, this place advertises online to be open 24/7, but there are no lights or obvious signage on the outside of the establishment to show that they are open. I sent my partner to pick up our order and he was confused because this location simply looks dark and CLOSED at night/after midnight.",

Evidently the online order goes to their corporate account, and they send a driver out to try to follow directions. Last week, the driver showed up at our business on the first floor, but didn't know how to get to the second floor. As far as I'm concerned, that's easy. You take an elevator. Again today my company and I ordered 10 more sandwiches, again another $70 yes. 2 hours later the sandwiches didn't show up, so I called Capriotti's on Paradise Ice. The girl who answered the phone told me that the driver could not find our address. She said that they still had all of the sandwiches with him or her, and they would be on their way. One of my biggest concerns was that all 10 of the sandwiches had mayonnaise on them and I didn't want any of my employees or managers to get sick. She assured me that the driver is in route to our business. Another hour goes by and still no sandwiches. I am done with this business. Supposably they refunded my credit card for the $70, however I still have not seen that credit on my bank account statement.",

    "text": "Lets just take a look at the picture that pops up on yelp for this place!!! Can I please put extra stars! I need a Bobbie in my life right now! This is a must when I am around one as I do not live near one but don't mind making a drive.    Ok so you have to try the Bobbie when you first go here, it will totally blow your mind and keep you coming back. Just don't let that keep you from trying other sandwiches they make as they are all exceptionally good and of course I want to make sure they don't run out of making mine if I am behind you!!  The staff here is friendly, fast and just plain awesome at taking your order and getting you fat and happy! The prices are very fair for a sandwich shop and if your smart take a friend and get the 20\" and split it! 6\" is always too small of a sandwich for me and 12\" leaves me waddling out the door, so with the split option you each get 10\" of pure amazingness.   The shop is always clean inside and there is plenty of seating and this location has a T.V. so you can watch the game if your into that while your eating. The drink choices are normal just your average fountain options plus they have a few bottled options of newer drinks.   Thats all I pretty much have to say about Capriotti's, but just writing this review I am going to find my nearest location or heck find the next flight to vegas to have another sandwich this second! So if your hungry and want a sandwich shop this is the spot and I will see you there!!",

As amazing as the sandwich is on its own, do yourself a favor and get it with the sweet and hot peppers, which they'll do for free.  The flavors are incredible.  I generally split a large with my gf, for the best value.  Price is $13.95 for a large, while other larges are about a dollar cheaper.  This Capriottis gets a special bonus because a) they have a fountain machine and b) they apparently deliver to hotels on the strip.  I will definitely take advantage of b next time I'm in Vegas.  Instead I had my cab drop me there before heading back to the airport.  Yeah, it's definitely that good.",

I think the thing that it did for me was the stuffing. It was perfectly seasoned. I'm not a huge fan of cranberry - but I LOVED it in this sandwich. The crunchy, yet soft bread, delicious turkey, perfectly seasoned stuffing, with a little salty, and little sweet from the cranberry - oh, I just.... I think I want another one. NO - I KNOW I want another one!  I thought the staff here was nice too, and even though it was busy when I walked in I felt as though they were handling it well. I'm pretty sure they get a lot of business with their location being so close to the strip and the employees exemplify the fact that they're used to this kind of bustle of people.  Will I be back?

Capriotti's gives hungry sandwich searchers a haven filled with good eats at reasonable prices.  Their location is right off the strip and not terribly hard to get to. Parking is abundant.  The service was prompt and courteous.  The food, it was quite tasty. I mean, how can you go wrong with a Philly Cheesesteak? The bread was soft but crusty, the meat and fix'n's were all cooked to order.  The only downside to the shop is that it's on the small side. You won't be able to fit a large group in here, but if you get your sandwich to-go you won't have an issue with that.",

Both really great tasting sandwiches, although I do believe this one is more bang for your buck. The 'Bobbie' sounds quite odd, but it definitely works and tastes freaking great. The cheese steak sandwich is pretty damn good, too! A little greasy, but the flavors were all wonderful.  The LARGE is really like an EXTRA-LARGE. A medium is like a foot-long you'd get at Subway. Definitely get the large!  Definitely coming back on any visits to LV. Recommend to all, LV locals and visitors alike.",

I had the small (9') I think it was meatball and it was bigger than most foot longs that you would get at Subway or whatever. Another thing, is these were all solid sandwiches, not like Subway where the thing is mostly lettuce and very little meat and cheese.  The meatball and sauce was tasty and the bread was nice and soft. Yeah this place is a lil pricey but you get what you pay for. This one was conveniently Located directly across from the Hard Rock where we were staying but I guess they have them all over the greater Las Vegas area. Oh, the one bad thing is it was kind of a wait so don't go here if you're in a  rush..",

We wanted to order a sandwich that best describes the joint so we got a Cap's Special- Capastrami. Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and COLE SLAW! The sandwich seriously melted in my mouth! The tang of the cole slaw complimented the pastrami just perfect! The bread was soft and easy to bite into. What makes this joint different is the construction of the sandwich. There wasn't an overflow of ingredients which made for easy eating.  What was disappointing was there were wasn't a selection of different sides other than chips. It would be nice to have a soup or salad with my sandwich.  I have to come back to try all their sandwiches!!",

    "text": "Speaking of sandwiches, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had was at Capriotti's last year in Vegas.  It's an interesting establishment; It originated in Delaware but now Nevada has by far the most locations.  Not sure if this was the one I went to, but I'm guessing the other locations are comparable.  It was kind of out of the way, away from the strip.  We took a cab there and didn't realize there was no ride back.  We ended up walking under the tremendous heat afterward but eventually found a taxi after walking several blocks.  Oh well, we had to try it because of the good things said about the place.  So we decided to share one of those super long subs.  We got the Capastrami because pastrami is the best meat on a sandwich (imo).  And....wow.  It was amazing.  The pastrami, coleslaw, and russian dressing of some sort made this sandwich so unique and so darn tasty.  It was just pure bliss.  I have to go back, but alas there isn't a Capriotti's remotely closeby.  Anyone up for a road trip to Vegas?  Or Ahwatukee, Arizona perhaps?",

    "text": "The shop is not 'aesthetically' pleasing, but Capriotti's is one of the great sandwich shops in town, for quality and price. The beef and turkey is roast on the premises. The sandwiches come in \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\". But do not be mislead by the label of 'small', since the small is actually 20 inches. I usually am able to eat half and save the other half for the next day. Their smalls are usually $10 total.   My personal favorites are  the \"Bobbie\" (turkey, dressing, and cranberry sauce, like Thanksgiving dinner on bread) and the Capistrami (Russian dressing, coleslaw, pastrami).  Capriotti's also has veggie varieties (i.e. turkey substitute, which tasted like cold cut turkey).  There are about four to five in the valley that I have gone to, and none of them disappoint. The one off Sahara just happens to be the closest to the Strip. The next closest to the Strip is on Maryland pkwy, near the university.",

I'm a puritan at heart about pastrami and I feel I've been short-changed by not having it on rye. Plus... the sandwich isn't toasted which is the way I like a sub roll if need be.  People have raved about the turkey gobbler... I found it boring. Shredded turkey, canned cranberry sauce and mayo on a sub roll. Eh...?  The staff at the Henderson store is maddeningly disorganized. But even with all the faults, I do come back occasionally.  Some would argue this is the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas... well,.. I don't agree. I'm still searching.",

Also the stuffing for the turkey sandwich, with cranberry sauce, is either bland or alternates with being really salty and dry/crumbly.",

Turkey is carved and fresh but slightly dry so the heaping amount of cole slaw takes away from tbe dry taste.  My opinion, too much cole slaw, not enough turkey.  Nice friendly staff and quick service though, and tv in the place to watch the football games on Sunday.  Don't know how people can give 5 stars for paying 9.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Oh, bread is average at best,  Maybe too chewy.  I had bread last night at maggianis,  that's good bread there. Dry turkey with smallish portions and too much cole slaw make it barely a 3 star.  It's a different concept of pulled turkey and I give them props for that.  Service is quick and friendly , props for that.  Just don't skimp on the best thing, the turkey. Oh, and as I was leaving, 2 people complained.  One wanted more provolone as they skimped on it, and another asked why no wheat options.",
