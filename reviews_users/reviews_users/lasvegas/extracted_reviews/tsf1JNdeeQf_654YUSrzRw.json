    "text": "I love, love, love, love Irish Pubs. I'm a sucker for them. What can I say? I'd rather go out and have a dark beer and a shot of Jameson than do just about anything else on a weekend. McMullans is a place I love.   I've been here on a few occasions, a couple dates with the boyfriend, and also meeting up with friends. The service is typically a toss of a coin. Either you get really stellar service or kind of \"eh\" service. I typically only see women working here, from the hostess to the waitresses to the bartenders. Service at the bar the last time I was here was so-so.   I had their Irish Breakfast, which is in Irish breakfast fashion - huge and way too much for me to eat. Plus they add on top of it a cup of beans, delicious heavy-as-heck bread, and a grilled tomato. Add to that Irish bacon, black and white pudding (blood sausage/sausage), a sausage link, and three eggs (however you want 'em). Oh it's just too much for me to eat, but I put a pretty good dent in it. The Irish Nachos are also freaking Awwwwe-some! Order these for sure if you want an appetizer to go along with your alcohol!  They're serving my favorite Irish staples - Guinness, Smithwicks, and Jameson. They also have a few other beers on tap for those that do not like the dark beers.  ALSO - live music the last time I was there! Very fun and entertaining. Lots of audience participation - this is not for the shy of heart! I was actually called out for clapping out of place during a song (although I SWEAR I didn't and so does my friend), but I was pointed at by the entire bar area and forced to have a drink for punishment!  Only reason I'm not giving 5 Stars is because the service can be so random. Doesn't matter - still one of my favorite places in Vegas!",

    "text": "My family and I have eaten at this pub many times and have had a wonderful time and amazing food.  However, our visit tonight was completely different due to the attitude of a server.  We always come for happy hour because we have three small children and want to avoid the crowds that generally come out later than that.  We were seated and then asked about happy hour items and were told that their crisps were recently taken off happy hour.  No problem, but the waitress went back and forth with us on if we were going to get them three times.  After we got our final no to the crisps and made our order for the sausage rolls she asked if that was all we wanted in a strange fashion as if it almost bothered her that that was all we were going to order and then she hastily ran off when we were still trying to order.  My husband then multiple times tried to get her attention so that we could order, once looking her in the face telling her that we wanted to continue to place our order.  He then got her attention for the last time and she finally came over.  We ordered the Irish stew and yet again she asked if that was all we were going to order.  We order things as we go depending on how we feel, as we do not like to waste food.  There were not that many tables for her to wait on, so I don't understand the constant awkwardness with the question of whether or not we were going to spend more or not.  At this point I told my husband that the situation was getting too awkward for me and that I just wanted to try to come back another day when that waitress would not be there.  My husband then spoke to the bartender/manager about the situation and he said that we could leave if we wanted to, but that he was going to speak with her.  As we were attempting to depart our waitress comes up to us and tries to discuss the situation of her behavior with us and says that she can sit us with another waitress that has just come on.  In all our years of eating out, I have never come across any business that would allow their employees to behave in this manner.  Had the manager come up and offered us a new waitress we may have been willing to stay, but the problem waitress herself coming over to discuss her attitude took the cake.  At that point we notified the new waitress that we couldn't feel comfortable eating there at that point, although she did seem very nice, our original waitress ruined any chance of that happening.  Sad, because this was our absolute favorite restaurant to eat at up until this point.  My husband is 100% Irish and he felt that this place was well up to par on food, but disgustingly terrible for the service.  A pub is a place that you feel like home, where you have great food and service.  Today, McMullan's did not live up to their name unfortunately.",

The best day for Fish and Chips - Thursday. It's all you can eat and believe me, I can eat. The fish is flaky, buttery and melts in your mouth. The batter is crispy and not too greasy (it should have some grease, it IS fried.) Paired with a pint of Boddingtons and I am in heaven.  For the weekend trips it's always Sunday Roast. Nothing beats savory roast beef covered in gravy served with perfectly roasted potatoes and fluffy Yorkshire pudding. In fact, most of the time I ask if they can forgo the veggies and give me extra pudd. So good with gravy poured inside. I have never tried the pork but my my mom has gotten the lamb and she says it is fantastic also.  As for desserts, try the sticky toffee pudding. The bread pudding was also very good. I so badly want to try other things on their menu (shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, Irish pie) but I am just hooked on their Fish and Chips!",

Now, sometimes there is a bit of a wait to get your second, third, fourth, etc serving, but definitely worth the wait. Fish and chips are pretty good. Fish always seems fresh, and the fish isn't masked with a think, heavy batter.   On days that aren't Thursday, I usually opt for their nachos. Cheddar cheese, bacon, & sour cream on their home made potato chips. Goes great with beer.   They also offer three different beer tasters, for only $5 each. Each comes with 5 different beers, which is great for those who haven't had a chance to try a different selection of beers, outside of the heavily marketed ones in America such as Bud, Coors, and whatever else are similar to those.   This establishment only got four stars from me because of the prices. A bit more expensive than I prefer, but not steep enough to keep me from going back.",

It definitely looks the part of an Irish Pub -- dark wood panels, large bar and people crowded into large groups cheering on the performer and their beers as they enjoy plates of delicious food.  My partner and I didn't order any entrees because we were doing the 24 hour buffet pass on the strip and had been stuffing ourselves like pot pies all day and instead decided to go for the appetizer called \"Irish Nachos\" thinking that by getting a half-order we could eat a light snack...   WRONG!    This is a GIANT plate..  and it was only a half-serving!  The typical tortilla chips are replaced by home made potato chips (\"crisps.\")  On top of these crisps are mountains of sour cream, meat and delicious fresh veggies.  So much eating light!  :)  Our server was awesome especially considering that she seemed to be the only one working all of the very full tables.  I'll definitely try and work a return visit in to future Vegas trips.",

Had 2 free nights at the Orleans and the first night that I was there, I was getting ready to take the free shuttle from the hotel over to the Strip.  Looked to the right and saw this place across the street.  I love these 24-hour pubs and taverns in Vegas, so I walked over there and really enjoyed everything about this place.  I didn't eat because I wasn't hungry, so I just had an iced tea and gambled a little at the bar.  2 days later, before driving back to LA, I hung out here for a little over 2 hours and won $95 on their table top slots and video poker.  They do a lot of fun things here.  For example, when someone gets a natural 4 of a kind on one of their video poker slots, they spin a wheel at the bar and that person, or even the other customers can win a prize, depending on what the wheel lands on.  I won a $15 booze voucher, but since I was leaving that night and don't live in Vegas, I gave it to this really cool guy who was sitting next to me at the bar.  I absolutely loved everything about this place!  The bartenders, the customers, the gaming and the atmosphere.  I will definitely come back here my next trip to Vegas, and also have lunch and/or dinner here, as I've heard their food's great as well and I also want to go there on a Tuesday night, since they have trivia every Tuesday night and I love bar trivia!",

Finally, the bartender and another employee (manager maybe, Irish accent) both materialize. The bartender asking what I'm drinking (I'm trying to see the taps) and I ask for a menu and say i'm there for lunch. He tells me his beer list is on the 2nd to the last page, then he walks away. I see what I want and stop him and tell him I'll take a pint of Harp, as he's trying to walk away. He pours my Harp and disappears.  Now, I have been a bartender, and I know there is prep work that needs to be done, but this guy just walks away into a back room and I don't see him for large blocks of time.  Then he walks out and heads out from behind the bar into a little room where the manager (other employee) was. My menu was down the whole time, I am looking at him the whole time to come take my order. He comes back to the bar and back to the back room without a glance in my direction.  After another in and out of the back room, I order from 10+ft away.  Hey! I'll take the shepherds pie. He asks a few follow-up questions and my order is whisked off to the back room.  (The 5star part) Within a VERY short time, my food is in front of me. And it's a very good shepherds pie!   He does ask me quite a bit in how everything was going, I had a mouth full of food and nodded.  Then he's gone again....  Manager (employee gent) passes by and askes if I need anything. I ask for my tab, (because I haven't seen the bartender in a while..) When he prints my tab, the bartender re-materializes for a brief moment, then poof is gone again.   I waiting a few minutes, so I could pay the bartender, I loathe leaving money on the bar. I finished my beer, still no bartender, so I leave my $18.99 tab and a twenty under my glass. I usually over tip. For that tab, I would usually leave $5 (that's over 20%). Not today.  For your inability to do the dictionary definition of Bartender (To tend the Bar) You get $1.01 and that's because I needed to leave and get back to work and didn't want to wait for my change.  P.S. I will say as I was there more people came in for lunch and the waitress, seemed like she was on the ball, if I go back for lunch, I'll be taking a table!",

    "text": "We were in town for Viva Las Vegas and this was across the street from the Orleans so we was easy. Turned out to be so good we ate there twice. First night we had the steak and mushroom pie which was delicious buttery goodness but the gravy was to die for. My boyfriend had the spicy pie and liked it. The next night we ordered the fries and gravy and it was the best ever. I could drink this gravy in a mug. Our group shared the mountain of corned beef nachos. It was pretty impressive but it would have been perfect if there was more meat layered in and not just on top. Twas a pretty tall mountain and the meat was gone by the time we got half way through. We did appreciate the the two chips though. I am pretty picky about my nachos and try to make the perfect bite on every chip and the ratio of toppings to chips were off, but delicious nevertheless. Car bombs were bomb but the old fashioned was one of the best I've had.",

We started off  with the Do Dheag Wings - 12 wings, 3 different ways - bbq, hot sauce & lemon pepper seasoning along with crab cakes which were solid starters. We also ordered dinner ala carte. I was in the mood for something different and went for the Irish stew - braised lamb, potatoes & other vegetables and came with homemade brown bread. The stew was hearty tasting and  was really satisfying. I also tried the bangers and gravy which was yummy & could be also a nice appetizer. Another tasty entree is the fish and chips. Service from our waiter was spot on and friendly.   Mcmullan's Irish Pub has a locals atmosphere but I felt comfy and welcome!",

    "text": "We eat here about 3 times a year and decided to bring a friend who had never tried this place for the first time on a Thursday afternoon. We were sat at a single table inside of the room in the bar area which was unfortunate because anytime we needed a refill or something from the server we had to walk out of the room to flag her down. We ordered the Irish nachos as we always do with no chives when they were delivered to the table we asked the food runner for ranch but none was ever brought. As we begin to eat the nachos we noticed they were missing bacon so I went out flag down the server told her there was no bacon and that I needed Ranch. She came into the room (to examine the nachos because she didn't believe us I guess) and then tried to tell my friend she had said no bacon (which she hadn't) and later on the ticket the only thing that was eighty-sixed was the chives. At no point did she offer to remake them, she brought a small cup of bacon to sprinkle on top along with the ranch. We then ordered a bowl of Irish stew to split at her suggestion. And after we only took two bites of soup and told her it wasn't good she took the bowl away but it still appeared on our check at the end of the meal as did a second order of nachos that weren't ours. Food was three stars and service was two stars not sure I would consider going back for a while which is a bummer because usually the food is so good but it definitely wasn't worth the $80 we paid that day.",

    "text": "My BF & I went here the day before St. Patrick's Day for the corned beef & cabbage. We live in Vegas but had never been here before. After carefully reading reviews for several places I chose McMullan's.   I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer with my dinner being the corned beef & cabbage. He ordered the chicken fettuccine. The portions are really good size... That being said, I enjoyed no other aspect of this experience.   Each of us ordered a soda rather than beer. We also elected not to sit in the bar, instead sitting in a quieter low-top section. Our waitress never introduced herself, nor did she smile or engage us at all. We both had empty drinks for a solid 5 minutes before she finally came and collected our empty glasses, leaving us waiting another few minutes before she brought refills back.   My BF liked the chicken fettuccine as did I enjoy the corned beef & cabbage. (The shrimp cocktail was NOT worth $10.) However, a dining experience is not based solely on food. The atmosphere of the restaurant and attentiveness of the server play a HUGE role in whether I will return or not. And while the surroundings inside were cool, our server killed it for me & we won't be returning.",

First thing I wanted to try the beer, so I got 'bits of beer' #3, Guinness, Kikenny cream ale, Murphy's Irish Stout, Boddingtons cream ale, and Smithwicks Irish ale. They were all good, some strong and some very light, loved them all!  We got two apps to go with the bits of beer, the Irish sausage rolls and McMullan's Irish nachos. The sausage rolls had sausage stuffed in puff pastry and came with a mustard dipping sauce, they were crispy like a egg roll. The nachoes were not expected, a tower of potato chips smothered in cheese, bacon, onions, tomatoes, chives and sour cream! Like a baked potato but made with chips, very good and very big order, both apps could have been shared by four or more!  For entree's, he got the Irish pie and I got Nanny Mac's Shepherds pie! Both were rich and delicious, filling and warmed my heart!  Carrots, sweet peas and ground beef in a savory broth covered with mashed! Served with brown bread! Yummy.  We still had room for dessert and had to try the sticky toffee pudding with scoop of ice cream! Very good food, exceptional  service and great beer!",

Well this time or a pound of fries and an even smaller scoop of tartar sauce and coleslaw and I hate it I wish I can Gree for what it cost me $19 I was extremely disappointed to add insult to injury what I ordered the bread pudding I was expecting a slice like the one before something comparable to a piece of cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory all I got was a 3 bite portion very small with a big spoon of whipped cream I ate it when the bill came I was in shock  they charged me $8 for a three spoon bite  bread pudding bite of bread pudding . I almost cried because I was very disappointed somebody somewhere decided to change the formula and cut back on the quality and size of food well that will be the last time I will go there if I do is just going to be for the coffee I'm sure a bunch of other customers feel the same way as I do best of luck Charming Charlie",

For example, I never knew what \"Marie Rose Sauce\" tasted like until I went there to have some chips, but their Irish Curry tasted like a spicier version of my mom's Asian Curry. It even has the same greenish color too.  Any time after 5pm, at any day, is happy hour here. And that means appetizers are half price and so are some of the selected beers. And these are not small appetizers, a plate of Irish chips is about the size of a meal at a fraction of the price ($4) that I would pay for a Big Mac at McDonalds. Nachos and fries are ridiculously huge on the plate.  You'll find a lot of exotic beers here, with names that you never heard of anywhere else. The folks serving you drinks are bona fide Irish, they talk with a accent thats kind of hard to understand without concentrating. And the drinks have a tendency to creep up on me, it builds up to a drunk feeling that is a lot stronger than what I am used to.   You can find a legitimate Irish Breakfast here too, with black pudding (blood sausage), eggs, etc. And it barely puts a dent in the bank account, just ten bucks!",

    "text": "As a new transplant to LV, I was excited to find out that Tuesdays are Pub Quiz night. I joined a team at McMullan's and have never looked back.  First thing to know is that if there is ANYTHING going on that night, the place will be packed. First Fridays, Trivia Tuesdays, Something or Other Sundays, random soccer matches between Kazakhstan & Bulgaria playing on all 27 televisions...whatever. Packed. And loud.   The servers work their butts off, but when you have that many people, service gets slow. I have a feeling their kitchen is understaffed as well. This is a very local type place. You're not going to find delicate service here...Think more like an \"everybody knows your name\" kind of place. Once the servers get to know you, you may not even have to order before they just yell \"the usual?\" when they see you.   Portions are huge. Everything we've tried has been good. The seasonal dishes are amazing (my personal fav is the chicken pot pie -- thanks to Jen for recommending it!)  Don't try to find something light and low-cal here though...This is real pub food. Outstanding fish & chips. Great fries. Huge sandwiches. Okay salads. Once you order on a busy night, it'll be awhile until they get back around to you, but check out is easy.   They don't advertise it much, but they do have a frequent eater program, so if you come here regularly, ask for a card application. It comes in the mail in about 2 weeks, but you get credit for everything you spend there.   The owner is on site daily. Most of the servers have been there for years. Great little place.",

    "text": "The Skinny: excellent pub specialities done right - perfection of the Irish pie! (4) service - a little sluggish but it's a pub (3), value: $11 for the steak and mushroom pie with the fixin's and $15 for a healthy portion of fish and chips (4).  A big shout out to the Yelpers - they were on the money with this place.  There are alot of things to love about this pub - first is the ambience. From the dark wooden panels on the wall to the True Irish transplants serving you, it give this establishment a feel of authenticity. The video poker area is well cordoned off from the pub and hence relatively smoke free.  We ordered a plate of their fish and chips and an Irish steak and mushroom pie (which takes 20 minutes but is worth the wait, my friends). While we were waiting, a neighbouring table were served their orders of fish. The reassuring crunch as they dug in signalled that McMullans ain't messing around when it comes to their food.  When our fish and chips arrived, we were surprised at the substantial portion (perhaps we would order the appy sized portion next time). Three large fillets perched on top of a mountain of fries with some coleslaw and tartar sauce. Perfect. The plate was also free of grease which was another good sign.  The fish was in a beer-battered style and had a perfect ratio of batter to fillet. The batter was light, crispy and held up well despite all the dunking into various sauces. Best of all - it wasn't oily. The chips were mid-sized cut and crispy. Overall, they held their texture pretty well with the passage of time. The coleslaw was pretty standard fare. The tartar sauce, though, needed a little tartness and sweetness but was okay.  The steak and mushroom pie was a wonder. The flaky dome arrived at the table accompanied by a mound of mashed potatoes and buttered peas. The filling was a satisfying combination of beef and mushrooms, stewed with some kind of flavourful ?beer.   The most amazing thing was the pastry. At first we thought the pie was in a ramikin but it was completely freestanding - that really speaks to the robustness of the crust. The pastry was flaky and crisp all the way around (including the bottom which normally tends to get soggy). McMullens has truly perfected the art of the Irish pie. The mashed potatoes were solid - had a nice flavour and a great gravy but could have used a little more texture. The buttered peas were good.  Overall, with these pub favourites done so well plus some rather interesting Irish beer and whiskey flights at affordable prices, this is the place to go for some Irish comfort.",

And my hubby is an Irish Pub connoisseur so he knows of what he speaks!  This one is def our new Vegas favorite and we'll be going back next weekend.  We had the fresh-made chips appetizer, with 2 curry sauces for dipping, and it was great (sauces weren't too hot which I appreciate).  Then I had The American Cheeseburger and it was the best burger I've had in a very long while.  I like medium-well and it was cooked perfectly and it had tons of flavor.  Hubs had the Irish Stew (w/lamb of course) and he also loved it.  Our friend had a burger too and she was very happy as well.  We didn't have a single complaint about the food and the menu has a nice selection - the traditional Irish dishes you hope for along with a few American items thrown in for the less adventurous like me.    There was a live band playing traditional Irish songs (along with a few American rock songs too) and they were fantastic - very talented with great energy.  The bar area was full and everyone was singing, clapping along and having a fun time, just like you expect at a great Irish pub.  There were a couple of girls doing the Irish Step Dancing and that's always amazing to watch!  The waitress was nice and very helpful and the prices are perfectly reasonable.  We had the burger, the stew, a diet coke a 2 harps and we paid about $44 plus tip.   We will be back very soon and I'm looking forward to making this a \"regular\" stop for us!",

Around 4pm today the bar was packed (you can only smoke in the bar), there were slightly more people in the restaurant too. I would agree with the service being average. By average I mean between really attentive and slower. I had the \"mini\" Irish nachos. There was no bacon but they were still good. And if your definition of \"mini\" is about the size of a small child's head or one of those baby watermelons, then the nachos are mini. Use the Tabasco sauce they give you. Have a Kilkenny, delicious. Come in, relax, calm down, have a drink and a bite.",

We where here for dinner and the food was not good, meat was super dry, quite bland, and there was no sauces of any sort to help make it palatable. We also had some nachos. Though aesthetically pleasing. Not very good unless your diet regularly consists of bucket amounts of canola oil. The home made chips where intriguing on the menu....but NO, they are little grease buckets is all. Staff was great, restaurant was fun but did not excel in any way.",

    "text": "Went here on Saint Patrick's weekend with my wife and another couple. It is absolutely confounding how hit or miss the service can be at restaurants around Vegas. Our server seems to have taken a vacation during the early portion of our visit, leaving us with empty glasses and puzzled looks on our faces. They had $4 Carlsberg draft beer in a 20 ounce glass that looked more like 12 ounces. The server seemed to try doubling up the service she provided to us and the table next to us by taking our orders when she took theirs,  and then she disappeared again for an inexplicable amount of time. The shepherd's pie is the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one. It was three bucks more for the dinner size portion, which I highly recommend you opt for. My wife had a chicken wrap that she described best as 'flavorless.' We ordered the Irish coffee for dessert, which was ok but not worth the 9 bucks they charge for it. The place is cramped and has woefully inadequate seating. It gets kinda loud in there when soccer is on. Overall, if you're looking for a great St. Patrick's weekend experience with great service, you're better off at Yard House or down on the Strip.",

For example, they stock three different ages of Redbreast, a highly regarded pure pot still whisky.  A glass of the smooth as silk15 year old type will set you back $16.  A glass of the venerable 21 year old stuff is $41.  On my first visit, I enjoyed the fifteen year old variety.  Sooooo smooth. So delicious.   As I settled my tab Monday night, the bartender explained that they feature a different whisky every month for a discounted price. Armed with this information, I returned last night to try this month's special,  the highly regarded John Powers Gold Label.  Absolutely delightful.    Happy Hour here is a chance to try their aps at half price. Monday I tried their crisps with curry sauce. Damn!  Those crisps are good.  Last night I tried the Irish nachos.  They're also delicious, but I liked the plain crisps better.  IMO, they don't really need cheese and sour cream and onions. The crisps are already perfect without all the toppings.     There's a regular bar and a video poker bar. I played a couple hours on the machine so my John Powers Gold Label was comped.  I went home extra happy.

We shared the Irish Poutine and Bits and Chips (Fish and chips) and both dishes were scrumptious. He ordered fries and gravy which was interesting.

Towards the middle of our date, we were waited on the red headed Scottish lady (I'm sorry I don't remember her name - 3 beers remember) but she was so funny. She got the heaters turned on for us cause I was freezing. The bar area was semi-packed so we stayed outside since it was just us. There was music out there and two tvs but they weren't on.

The rest of the space is full of large tables, private rooms, and a stage. If I close my eyes and think really hard, I can imagine this place feeling so authentic. Full of life, love, energy, great friends. I've never been to Ireland, but when I close my eyes and imagine this place packed to the brim, it's what I picture being in a local pub there to feel like.  Their wine selection is impressive. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, I know the blasphemy in an Irish pub of all places, and ordered the sliders. Corned Beef, BBQ steak and Fried Fish. Each one has it's own unique flavor and were super delicious. There is plenty more this place has to offer, so I'll be back for a pint and whatever live performance takes place on that stage.",

It is a wonderfully diverse and yet still traditional Irish pub, with live music and sometimes even dancing buy local Irish dancers! Their breakfast was wonderful, loved the bangers, and the service is friendly and attentive. Even when they were busy, they made sure to make us feel welcome and tended to. For dinner, I went with the lemon pepper wings. They were not my favorite, but my girl tried them and she liked them very much. The menu has many choices, and my friends were very happy with their wrap. The decor is charming and made me forget I was just off the strip in Vegas.",

Find the spot that strikes your fancy and await the bar wench! I mean, uh, your server or bartender.  There is no \"best time\" to come- there's always something going on! Select half-price apps for HH (3-6pm AND 11pm-2am daily!), weekday lunch and dinner specials, separate breakfast and late night menus, and even a Sunday roast dinner! I haven't had a significant portion of the menu, but it's a step up from the usual bar food: the mussels come in a tomato-based broth and a generous portion, splurge for the full size fish and chips (they're AYCE on Thursday nights), and put onion gravy on everything.  Service has been casual and friendly for both of my recent visits, attentive but not annoying. There are some closed-off tables and rooms that are good for small group events or special occasions. Good selection of beers and liquors if you're looking for something new to try- the Wells Sticky Toffee Pudding beer wasn't my thing, but it might be yours!",

Oh and the coolest part? It has a patio. It may not be used much in the hot summer but it's great any other time of the year or late at night.   McMullan's is a pretty big property, so most of the time you don't feel too crowded. It does get rather rowdy during live music on weekends though. This is also a regular hangout for Cirque folk after shows get out. Irish nachos are basically a must have if you want something to share around. The sliders are awesome because you can get three different kinds at once. I love variety.   I've been to the trivia once and it was easily the best trivia in town. They had a leader board screen and one of the rounds was a name that tune round which was so fun. I don't know if that's a regular thing but it should be. Any time I'm trying to think of a bar near the south Strip to go to that isn't on the Strip I pick this one. It has genuine character, something most Las Vegas bars do not have.",

The trivia hosts are lively and hilarious. It's very high energy and a great way to socialize.  Our group wasn't too great at trivia, but we had fun. The hardest round is the music round. They play 3-5 seconds of songs and you just hope you guessed some of them right. In the end, you end up learning some neat facts.   As for the food, the entire menu looks delicious.  I ordered the Limerick Burger. I was impressed, and definitely want to explore the rest of what they have to offer. I kept seeing waiters walk by with plates of GIANT nachos, so that might be what I try next.   Also, the decor here is cool. It's nautical themed, so there's various pieces of ships and wheels adorning the place. It's fun to look around. If you're into sports, they've got TVs. I also saw they have a video poker room, and a larger room with more tables in the back.",

It was such a great time, everyone was so friendly and the beer was delivered fast, frothy and cold. Yum.  This is one place that you go to if you want to meet all of your friends and have a great time. It actually reminds me of a place in Chicago that my friend B. took me to. He played rugby and he and all of his friends used to hang out in this dark, raucous place just drinking and telling tall tales and basically just partying. That is McMullan's. Authentically Irish. Good times.  So, I could say five stars just for the beer, service and fun, but the food was delicious! I was in an Irish pub so only Irish for me! I had the Irish pie with steak and mushrooms and whoa. It was fabulous. There is absolutely nothing like drinking and eating great pub food, especially when it's so authentically done. It had the tender, flaky crust, the really good gravy and a side of mashed potatoes and peas. Doesn't get better than that! It was so big that I had to share it with my friend!  All in all, this place is the real deal. In a city where there isn't a lot of authenticity, McMullan's shines. I have a good feeling I may make some of the best friends I'll find here. Loved it.",

    "text": "This is the best Irish pub in Las Vegas, and I specifically went looking for one I felt was worthy of describing as such. It beat out the Nine Fine Irishmen in the New York New York, as well as Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay for the title. We came over after a movie at the Orleans on a lark, and could not have been happier. They had food and beer specials, and we got there just in time for happy hour, when pints (real 20-ounce Imperial Pints, not 16-ounce American ones) are a dollar off, and most of the appetizers are half-price as well. We started with the Irish Nachos, which other reviewers have gone on about for good reason! Layers of crisps and cheese and bacon with a dollop of sour cream the size of Texas on it. And that's just the \"mini\" size. We also had their brilliant chips & gravy with their fantastic onion gravy--inexpensive, simple and delicious. The main course included show-stealing portions of their chicken and curry pie, and the best Reuben sandwich in living memory. We hadn't the room for dessert, but  returned for another visit to try the toffee pudding. I also tried the Irish Breakfast on our second visit, and the black and white pudding coupled with real rashers of Irish bacon and the best banger I had in a long time sold and resold me on making this not only my #1 Irish Pub pick, but my favorite restaurant in all of Sin City. The decor is excellently authentic, down to pictures of regulars in the wall and a map of the Emerald Isle on the ceiling. Banquet rooms offer seating for large parties and interior partitions give a good but of separation between smaller tables. The service was also superb every time we came in; the bartenders were personable, the wait staff was friendly and made sure we always had a fresh pint when we needed one, and we never wanted for attention yet didn't feel smothered. We unfortunately never made it in when they had live music, but the fact that they're already the best Irish pub we could find in town coupled with featuring live Irish music just makes them better. Come in here and enjoy the craic. As soon as I come back through Las Vegas, I'm going to.",

It's a pound of home made potato chips, covered in Irish cheddar with Bacon, tomato, chives and sour cream. Need I say more besides during happy hour (4-7pm every day) they like 1/2 off! All the food here is amazing and we'll be the first to admit that most pub food isn't great. The chicken curry pie, the fish and chips and the reuben stand out. Good Lord they have Murphys on tap!   The entertainment is great most of the time although we've see some hippie non-Irish band there a few times that kind of stink, but still. The decor is awesome, it's like being in the Shire. The mood is fun, rowdy and loud, you'll feel like you are in the lower decks of the Titanic.. uh, before the whole iceberg thing of course and the staff if about as good as it gets.

My bangers and mash were tasty, but lacked the extra \"flair\" that the 5 star restaurants have. I'll be back, but I probably wouldn't drive across town for this place before I try another irish pub in my 'hood. DeVeres Irish Pub in Davis & Sacramento is still my favorite",

McMullans staff was absolutely friendly and service was great. I had a delicious salad special with hot chicken breast tender slices on top of it. Not sure if it was a regular menu item as i just talked with the server and told her what i was looking for...and there you have it ~ they made it for me. Fresh with the right amount of heat.  Definitely going back for some again, not to mention the beer selection was \"SICK\" in an awesome way! I would say this is a must for World Cup viewing with friends! Let the fun begin.",

    "text": "This was my second time here and I honestly can't remember how the service was before so I'll treat this as a first time experience.  We arrived here around 7:00pm on a Saturday night and it was quite loud due to some kind of wedding celebration being held on the opposite side of the bar.  Anyways, after looking around and observing the environment, we were immediately greeted by one of the hosts and his enthusiasm and friendliness pretty much set the tone for the night.  He asked us where we wanted to sit and gave us two menus before we walked over to the bar.  After sitting down, we were, again, greeted immediately - this time by the bartender Chris.  I was already very pleased with the service after only being in here for less than 5 minutes.  Chris was very amicable and her Irish accent genuine.  She talked to us for a bit before giving us waters with a wedge of lemon.  The water tasted very mineral-like and it bothered me that it had a carbonated after-taste to it.  I didn't like this so I told her to change the water and she was very understanding and didn't make me feel bad.  After the water tasting like this again for the second time, she informed me that it must've been the tap they had been accessing that night.  Not a big deal, but this was the only \"downside\" to the experience.  Anyways, after glancing over the huge beer menu and even bigger food menu, we decided to order a Boddingtons, Smithwicks, and the Half Order of Irish Nachos with Corned Beef to share.  The nachos were insanely huge for two people but they were absolutely delicious -- generous amount of corned beef and other yummy toppings.  I loved the fact that they stayed authentic to Irish style cuisine and used crisps (potato chips) as the substitute for tortilla chips.    We didn't end up finishing the nachos because they got hard after a while due to the cheese hardening.  I ordered a Moscow Mule afterwards and was surprised that they let you keep the Ginger Beer -- that was alcoholic at 4.8% ABV -- along with the Mule because it's a part of the cocktail.  No one's ever done this for me before, even with non alcoholic ginger beer, and I really appreciated it.  As we were about to finish our drinks and food, there was live music themed to an Irish vibe.  I left the guitar player a tip before we left.  The total was around $38.00 without tip and was very reasonable for the three drinks and delicious food ordered.    I would definitely come back here again and also to partake in their famous Trivia Night every Tuesday at 8pm.  Stellar service and impressive menu.  Very authentic and McMullan's definitely adhered to their Irish roots! Slainte!",

The corned beef was flavorless slices of meat mixed in with runny watery potatoes, a carrot and some celery. The cabbage was boiled beyond recognition. That last dish was $15! All needed salt badly and all were served up in flimsy aluminum containers with prepackaged sporks to eat with (think jr high lunch gone bad). Wow. Just wow.   So unacceptable and sad. The only saving grace was the band.   We will not be returning here again. Being local and loving places off the strip, I know we can do better. Yuck.",

I assumed it would just be typical pub food, but once we started looking at the menu, we had a hard time deciding what to order. Every item on the menu sounded delicious. I eventually settled on the Grand Irish Rueben which was indeed delicious, and the red onion relish that came on it really help set itself apart from typical Rueben sandwiches.   This most impressive thing about this place is what my buddy ordered. He got the Irish Monster Burger, which is a one pound Ground Top Sirloin burger with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, bacon, onion rings, and 1000 Island Dressing. It also comes on an abnormally large sized bun. I challenged my buddy to eat the whole thing and surprisingly he did.

Now I know that might turn some away, but if you can't handle smoke, you can eat in the dining room - no smoking there.  I have only ordered two things at McMullen's; the fish and chips and the Caesar salad. The fish and chips have got to be the best in Vegas, possibly the best in Nevada. Battered cod perfectly deep fried so the crust is light and crunchy, and the fish is cooked perfectly. McMullen's take on a Caesar salad is inventive; whole romaine lettuce leaves wrapped in mozzarella cheese, drizzled with a house made dressing and sprinkled with very garlicky croutons. It's a bit messy, enough for two, and quite delicious.  I don't know why Yelp lists McMullen's under the heading \"breakfast and brunch,\" when most of the menu seems devoted more towards dinner. I check out the menu every time I go (even though I always order the same thing), and it's very eclectic. The meat pies look delicious, and I've promised myself that the next time we go, I'll try the curry.  The service is good, and the ambience is friendly. The dining room can get a bit noisy, but it's the happy noise of people having fun. However, if you don't minding waiting for one, there are a few tables tucked away in corners where the sound is muffled a bit.  Make sure you try the IPA Ranger beer that's on tap. It's a bit fruity but finishes with that bitter taste we all expect from a well-crafted beer. And it's ice cold out of the tap.  In fact, have one for me too! Whatever you do though, do NOT miss this gem of a pub!",

The food is so delicious! We ordered a half portion of the Irish nachos...great for 5-7 people. The large would seriously need to be a party of 8 or more. The mini would be perfect for 3-5 people! I would recommend getting extra bacon on them or one the meats to give a little more flavor!   The fish and chips, chicken Florentine, shepherds pie, and steak & mushroom pie are incredible! We had a fairly large party (6 adults and 2 kids) and shared these four entrees. The portions are HUGE and are well worth it! We even had leftovers!  The servers are kind and helpful. The service itself is on the slower side. We waited a long time for our drinks, appetizer, food, and dessert. It wasn't super busy when we got there and ended up being there for about 2 hours. It's a slow experience, which might be a good thing since the food is so good and heavy.  For dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding and chocolate cake! Both are absolutely wonderful!",

    "text": "Though McMullan's is one of my favorite Vegas Irish Pubs (if not THE favorite), we hadn't been here for a long time.  But we went to see a show at the Orleans, and two of our friends live in Henderson, so this was a no-brainer.  The first thing that struck us when we walked in was a familiar voice.  It was John Windsor, our favorite Irish entertainer, late of J.C. Wooloughan's at the Marriott.  We'd gone to see him there after a long hiatus and found out they'd changed his hours.  Now he's done there for good, but playing at McMullan's every Saturday night and early evenings on Sundays.  We were thrilled - he's just fabulous.  And because he's so popular, the bar was jammed.  But we were there for dinner.  At 9:30 we had no problem getting a table for 6, but the small, cozy room they seated us in filled up right after us.  The count for the evening was:  two shepherd's pies, one steak sandwich, a Reuben burger, chicken wrap, and another burger.  My Reuben was the Irish version - no sauerkraut.  Instead, it came with a red onion spread that I was glad I'd ordered on the side.  The onions were chopped and sauteed, I think, but were mixed up with a seasoned mayo.  I love mayo, but it doesn't love me, my hips, or my cholesterol, so I was able to use just a tiny bit, instead of having to scrape off tons of it.  The burger, which I ordered medium, was perfectly cooked, and served on thick and tasty toasted marble-rye.  It came with friesthat were good, but too salty (what else is new?)  I could have had mashed or potato chips.  My friend - the smart one - had the chicken wrap, but got fresh veggies, for a $2 upcharge.  She loved both of them.  The veggies were a large portion.  My husband has had the Shepherd's pie a lot there.  He loves it, but since it's served with no sides, it seems a little pricey to me, at $14.  Actually, it was $15, since the waiter asked if he wanted the cheddar cheese on it, and then there was a dollar upcharge for that, too.  The do offer a lunch-sized portion, but it's only $2 less.  I had the Magner's on tap, a great alternative, since I'm not a beer drinker.  The atmosphere is wonderful, all wood and clubby, and very Irish.    While I'm a great fan of McMullan's for its homey atmosphere and terrific food, I have to take away a star because I don't like the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed in a place that's not on the Strip, but almost charges like it is.  Still, now that we know John Windsor's a regular, we'll be back again soon!",

Sorry, at 11am the doors were locked. Parking lot empty. I think the owner needs to investigate what his staff told him. THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.",

For dinner we had a chicken-enriched salad and Irish stew, where the lamb greatly resembled beef and the only veggies with carrots, potatoes, celery and onions....no turnips or other authentic root crops. Prices were reasonable, ambiance and service were fine, and it was a nice break from the casino atmosphere and noise.",

The competition to lure would be patrons with guinness and irish shanties are strong in Vegas, and there are a sea of choices to choose. However, I will attest that McMullans should be given a shot, two or 3 of Jamesons in your go to places:  1) wide variety of food options. Different burger styles, curry pies, irish nachos, and of course the fish and chips. They have appetitizer options during happy hour but the bang for your buck is getting the irish nachos half size.  2) John Windsor, the guitar maestro that will seduce your ears with grand ol songs about love, life, whiskey, and beer.  3) McMullans have a shuttle service during Knights game day with limited seating. Call for details on price and all.  So do yourself a favor, grab a pint or seven and sing along the locals at McMullans.",

    "text": "My wife and I got into The Orleans across the street late as flight was delayed on a Friday night. By the time we got to our room and situated it was after midnight but in True degenerate fashion we wanted to gamble as quickly as possible. Since there weren't any real options at Orleans open past midnight, we trekked across the parking lot to this place instead.  As an Arsenal fan, in trips past I've scouted out areas that show Premier League matches in Las Vegas since early morning doesn't usually go with sports bar timing. McMullans was always the recommendation so I knew that the food was at least going to be okay.  I had Strip Steak and eggs while my wife had a half order of the Irish Nachos. She had a similar plate at Nine Fine Irishmen last trip but while those nachos were good, these are absolutely terrific. But if you're \"mostly\" eating alone, get a mini. Wife got a half order and she and I ate on them to the point of discomfort. We still completely filled a to go box with the leftovers and couldn't finish them later after gambling and drinking to the wee hours of the morning.  Bar was a little loud especially for how slow it was. We were there at around 1 AM and it looked like a big event had just died off with only 10 or so stragglers left in the main bar area. Doesn't really matter either way, the food was great, service was as well. We will now add this to a rotational must each time we visit the city.   And for those that said it was pricey, I'd like to know compared to what. We live in Idaho and it's about the cheapest place to live in the country and I would happily pay the prices they asked on their menu if there was a McMullans nearby to me. For Las Vegas, at least comparative to the casino restaurant prices, this place is a value ALL DAY. Go enjoy yourselves, have a couple great beers and definitely recommend the nachos. Will be getting the fish N chips next time as well. Thanks for the great experience.",

The place is pretty nice as your typical Irish bar, but I've noticed a lack of windows in the establishment. The decor was pretty nice a lot of Irish flags from various counties.  If you're a bulldog stand this is a place to be to watch a Georgia game they actually have their own room where you can actually hear the game. Their portions are rather large, although their service is a little slow.   I tasted their Irish nachos (potato chips instead of corn chips), which were very good and plentiful. I also ordered the Scotch eggs. This was my first time trying this. It is a hard boiled egg that has been rolled with sausage and various Meats breaded and deep-fried. It was very flavorful and quite substantial, I would definitely order it again.  I also had the best Irish coffee I've ever had it was served on a glass goblet, with this delicious cream and powdered with some cinnamon in the shape of a shamrock, it was a beautiful sight to see.  Usually I'm not impressed by Irish bars but I definitely was impressed by this one. I enjoyed their food and atmosphere it was definitely a really fun place to hang out and watch a game.",

Never checked on us, got our food before our drinks, then when we were leaving, and was just very full of attitude when she did come. Then, I was standing at the table finishing my beer, my 3 friends had walked outside. She came to get the tip off the table and said \"oh, big spenders! Thanks!\" VERY SARCASTICALLY. ride bi$ch and definitely won't be back because of her. Unfortunately I don't know her name. Mind you, she's lucky we left her anything at all but we were nice.",

I got the Reuban Sandwhich last time i was there and it was amazing (I'm just not a fan of Rye).  The wife ordered a sierra nevada pale ale, and it was sour and flat.  She also ordered a burger, and the bun was soggy before she got to the second half.    Love the atmosphere, but the last experience was a bit disappointing for the price I paid.  Regular side of fries with my sandwhich were nothing special.",

SO GLAD we chose here. I was looking for something Irish and one of the other places had a review that said \" what Americans think Irish food is\".I looked at the menu and agreed. Then found this place.  I loved the atmosphere, the room we sat in used antique couches for booths! Our server was so sweet and was attentive. We got the Irish sausage rolls and chips and gravy.  They were both great. The gravy tasted like authentic German spatelze gravy so I loved it! I got the stew on the recommendation of our server and it was DELICIOUS! I will eat here again for sure, next time we come to Vegas. And after reading more reviews I will absolutely get the irish nachos!",

The happy hour really can't be beat, from 3PM-6PM and 11PM-2AM, with 1/2 priced full-size appetizers.   I usually order a plate of the Irish Nachos with Blackened Chicken. These nachos are like CRACK. Fried potato crisps covered in cheese, bacon and chicken. Absolutely delicious.  If you're going just for the appetizers, I also recommend the sausage rolls and chicken fingers, both are absolutely delicious!  In addition to the appetizer menu, the items on the regular menu are pretty damn tasty as well. I love the Grilled Blackened Chicken sandwich, which provides a pretty filling meal for $9.  For the most part, the service at this place is pretty good. There are a couple of bartenders that are less talkative than others, but most everyone is rather friendly.   I recommend avoiding this place on Friday nights, as there is a loud and not particularly great band that plays covers all night (Darby O'Gill and the Little People). Other than that, you're golden!",

Fish starts to smell like ammonia when it rots and decomposes. Mmm-mmm good.

    "text": "Edit 2: After the pleasant experience with the management I wanted to give an additional 2 stars since a lot places don't pay attention to reviews let alone go ahead and apologize and explain their procedures. I can't wait to try the food! Edit: After having contact with the business it appears the entertainment usually starts later on Sundays. Because it was st. Patrick's days entertainment was pretty much all day. Lesson learned here is on holidays call the establishment to confirm any changes to the usual. I definitely will be going back though probably not on a holiday haha!  **Warning** Review based on service. Never was able to try food. I walked away.  It's saint Patrick's day so I was excited for some Irish food. I figure we'll do an early dinner since later in the night they have live bands and will probably be super packed.  We show up and it is super packed 2 hours before the live bands are scheduled to perform. Well turns out the info they had was wrong and so they wanted $20 L.E.T. tax per person. Yeah I don't think I am going to pay $20 per person just so I can sit down and pay another 60-100 for food and drinks with probably slow service because of the amount of people there.  I know why they charged it too so people don't go early to avoid fee and wait for the band to come on but man 2 hours so early. I just wanted me some good Irish pub food! I was gonna be outta of the place in like an hour if food was prepared fast.  Maybe in the future I will go back to try the food and drinks but not any time soon.",

Unlike most bars always find machine on the bar here at McMullan whole area not single machine!! The bar area really nice, they have little cubby hole area at one end of the bar (so can have your own mini party area of sorts), and interior designs with all the little decor spills Irish. They opened up the non smoking side of the bar with since last visit with more bigger tables and even table with pour your own beer from the tap (the prices have no idea; believe it goes by the volume you purchase). I believe on the weekends they play live music on the little stage set up inside and still have trivia night on tuesday believe. The Guinness!!!!!!!! Nothing better in life then drinking Guinness in Irish Pub. But even better is one that done RIGHT taking the time let the beer settle then top off the pint for perfect Guinness. They even till you that up front so if running pinch late that GREAT thing. The vive from moment step in is Irish form the decor, obviously most patrons throwing back Guinness, Harps, or maybe some black and tans, the music play inside, and the food.   The food interesting being years since last visit but yet HH menu still exactly the same. Great thing. I have always been fan of the nachos! Kettle chips Brilliant! When you get too the bottom of the mound nice know that not soggy enough chip hold all the good stuff on top. It mound even half size is lot of food. The sausage rolls best part is the dough on the outside nice hot and moist. The mustard dipping sauce perfect compliment. The fish and chips some of the best fish and chips I had in town. Everything is reasonable price too! HH is awesome!  The only thing that conscious of if Wranglers game night. It can get packed before and after the game. Thankfully some of iceacholics family day drinking (HH) so beat the crowd could enjoy the company. It gets packed the place tends too get loud and since small place gets nuts. Miss my McMullans think need go back more often especially if on Guinness binge. Lol!!!!",

This place just has this amazing cozy feel. The food is so well-prepared - the beer battered onion rings are AMAZING! The very best in town.  The bartenders are great & many have been there since I first came here in 2010 - so that should tell you how they enjoy working here, or at least so it seems! Dallas can literally make you anything & then school you on it. He will have you drinking vintage cucumber gin whatevers & 12 year aged whisky & stumbling out with a newfound interest in peaty scotch, lol.  Of course this place gets packed for events, games, and for good reason. But sometimes, you can hide in a little corner & just enjoy quietly.  Sometimes, they even have Irish step dancing.  There is just a touch of charm to this place that only the Irish could foster.",

Today's beer special was $4 ranger ipa and they had a $8 bbq chicken sandwich special. The food was quite good and the atmosphere was just what I was looking for. Bartenders were very attentive.

She came over with a proposal - there was a table in the trivia section if we didn't mind it. She would just have to bring over two stools. We were perfectly ok with that. Now I had read other reviews about the Tuesday trivia, but I'm glad we sat there because although we were chatting away, it was noisy enough where no one noticed us. We tried to guess the trivia questions - they were a lot of fun and some were quite challenging. They gave away $50 and $100 bar tabs to the runner up and winning groups. I'll definitely have to come back again for this.   The atmosphere is extremely laid back and our waitresses (we had two) were friendly and great.   Richard ordered a Carlsberg and a Guinness (I believe one was $8 while the other was $6) while I had a Murphy's Irish Stout for $4. We shared a half size of the Irish Nachos (homemade crisps topped with bacon, scallions, cheese, and sour cream) for $8. The half size was ENORMOUS! (that's what she said). We couldn't come nearly close to finishing it, but it was sooooooo delicious (although sooooooo bad).   Our total came out to be a little over $30 with tip. Great place to hang out - I need to come back for their AYCE Fish & Chips or their Sunday Roast Dinner (sounds ah.mazing!).",

We tried the wrapped sausage appetizer - it was delicious! The bread was flaky like a pastry. We also had the shepherds and Irish pie, both with beef. The shepherds pie was similar to a chili dish. We ordered it with cheese on top and regretted it. It was really loaded with cheese, which overpowered the rest of the dish. Both were really good. As far as beer selection, this place does alright. Of course, they have Guinness. We tried a porter, and it was so good, and thick so that you couldn't even pass a light through it. We recommend this place for a few decent beers, the Irish pub feel, and delicious although heavy food.",

Bob is a regular there and they treat him well.  The bartenders are quick and friendly.   Not sure how often Bob comes in but they all knew him by 1st name.   I had a Kilkenny and a Blue Moon and they were tasty...makes me long for Ireland and their beers/pubs :(  I guess the trivia night gets tons of people (200 sometimes?!) which seems kinda fun.  The band is good (not great) they are really loud as the space is kind of small.  If u don't like loud music stay away weekend nights i guess :/   We were sitting at the bar and the bartenders even pointed out a booth that emptied if we wanted it away from the noise of the band which was nice of them.  I guess every so often they do a golf gig including golf, food and drinks all day for $100 which sounds like a great deal.  I'm looking forward to going back to try some food.  Cheers",

The veggie burger was going to be my choice, but the waitress, who said she was vegetarian, didn't care for it. Oy! So, I got the homemade potato chips and a house salad with balsamic dressing. The potato chips were extremey greasy. I know, I know, what did I expect? Well, not that greasy! But my salad was FANTASTIC. Seriously, it was delicious. Great portion, for only $3.5, it was HUGE. The dressing was super tasty too. I would go back for the salad. I am not kidding. My cousin swears by the Irish coffee. I would have tried but I wanted something cold to drink, and hot coffee with salad is not my thing. If you eat meat, the have a great happy hour menu that's 1/2 price. Very cool, except, not for me! I just read Misti's review of this and am disappointed I didn't get the veggie burger, AND she mentions delicious cole slaw. OK, I'm sold. i'm going back!!!",

While we were out running errands at Home Depot we decided to get a bit to eat and walked into this nearly empty pub in the middle of the afternoon.  The Irish Nachos were AWESOME.  They were a special at the time of day we visited and came in three sizes.  I ordered the medium size after asking the server what the difference was and he gave an indication of the plate sizes, but failed to mention they would be piled about 8\" high.  Seriously, the smaller size (I think it was a \"light\" portion would've fed three people easily.  I'm a pretty good eater and I don't think I got 1/3 of the way through the regular order even with two other people helping a bit.  We ordered the same item at a pub on Fremont the next night at the same price it was about 1/4 the size and didn't have nearly the amount of toppings.",

It's not on the strip so you need to cab it or drive there but it's soooo worth it. It's right across the street from the Orleans hotel. We ordered quite a bit of food and everything was fantastic. We had the fish and chips, the Irish nachos, the shepherd's pie, the lamb stew and the sticky toffee pudding and every bite was amazing. The lamb stew was the most flavorful Irish lamb stew I've ever had in a restaurant. Even if you have no room at all for dessert you still must have the sticky toffee pudding. Easily one of the best desserts I've ever had anywhere. They also have a cute 5 dollar beer sampler that is fun for having different types of beer while also leaving room for all the good eats. The waitress could not have been nicer. Awesome Vegas find.",

Unlike the vast majority of bars in town, this is not a corporate operation run by MBAs from afar.  Instead, the eponymous McMullans are there every day.  Furthermore, they are extremely involved in the community.  Their \"St. Baldrick's\" charity drive raises donations in six figures for children with cancer every year.  McMullan's Pub features all the beverages that you would expect in an Irish joint with the food being a definite step above usual bar fare. (I'm partial to the fish & chips, myself.)  However, the social experience, good music and the \"craic\" is what you go for here and you get a full heaping serving of it on every visit.",

The hopeless helpless bastards that stare longingly into drink and remember the better days, the happier times, the girl in Bangcock who did something to their anus they never thought they would like...and now they can't find anyone to do again. So, a few weeks ago while back out west on...um...well...let's call it business...I was in the bar at 4:30am and stated until about noon. The perfect time to be in a great bar. With Mcmullan's it was more of the same...some great...some not so great. Great...the overnight bartenders are way better than the prissy little punks who work during the day...one in particular who worries more about his hair than anything else. Great...the food is excellent for a pub at any time of day or night, and quite frankly...it was better at 5am. Of course I was coming down off of paint fumes, gas fumes, turpentine and a pill someone told me would turn me into a donkey, but all i kept seeing was Buddy Epson everywhere. Strange. Great...amazing soccer matches were on and the fans seemed really fanatical to be there at 5am watching their teams. The bad...the music is horrible beyond horrible. It is a tape, I guess, and it is all bad from start to finish. The Irish are known for bad music...Bono, Riverdancers, Charlotte Church, etc... but this is America...we love good bar music! The bad...they kept fiddling with the lights. We wanted it dark, the bartender wanted it brighter...she won. Well, when she pays for the drinks and the food she can have it anyway she wants. Until then...we pay, she does. Period. The place is still uneven and far from its former glory...but they make money and people are always there...so I guess they figure adequate and decent are good enough...mores the pity.",

The server was friendly and helpful with some suggestions about the specials. I had missed breakfast this morning so I made up for it by ordering breakfast this evening. I went with the Corned Beef Hash, eggs and home fries ($7). The corned beef hash was one of the best home made corned beef hash I have had in Las Vegas. The eggs were ordered over medium but they came over hard. The home fries were good. I like that they were not greasy. The beer selection while varied was a little disappointing for an Irish Pub. I was expecting a wider selection, but I certainly had no problem finding an IPA that I liked. The prices on the late  night menu were a good deal. I'll have to go back for a normal breakfast to see if the price is the same. Oh yeah, if you have your laptop with you they have free wi fi. That's just a nice bonus on top of a good experience.",

I've been coming here for years and the Irish wood, knick knacks, live music, and, of course, the food keep me coming back for more. I've brought friends, family, and coworkers, and we've all laughed at our punny puns and ooh'd at our plates. This place welcomes community and makes food matter more than a quick lunch transaction.   I love the shepherd's pie, the Irish nachos (featuring real cheese and feeding a small army), the pasties, and the fish n chips. Those are my go-to's.   Recently, I tried the chocolate cake, warm and with ice cream. I kid you not. The best chocolate cake I've ever had. Heaven in every bite. Rich doesn't begin to cover it, and by the time you find the right words, it's done, the plate licked clean, every bite treated with a religious reverence, an experience to be repeated upon the next visit.",

The machines are very  very tight, but luck is just that. There is a separate enclosed bar area for gambling and smoking and an outdoor patio that is nice now that fall weather is here. Tuesdays are trivia night and always alot of fun. There are bands as well. I miss Darby o gill and the little people! They were my fav! It is very authentic with amazing nooks everywhere and good food and drink. Can't go wrong. Def give it a try! The only negative I've ever noted is that the restroom is way to small for how busy it can get. Oh and I'd like to win on the machines once in awhile",

The food is spectacular. We had the Irish nachos, Irish stew, and Shepherd's pie...all of it BOMB! Can't wait to come back and explore more of the menu (which is huge). It's a little on the pricey side, but the food is definitely way above your standard \"bar food,\" so definitely worth the price.

    "text": "McMullan's changed my local life!   I walked in here for the first time a month ago for Trivia Night, every review I've read said it was the best in town but since I didn't have my own team, I was hoping to find a group of cool people who would let me join theirs.   The host immediately noticed my apprehension and was so sweet in approaching a table asking if they'd accept a lone person for the night. He brought me over, introduced me and I've been playing with them every since! (Not that I'm any good.)   This is the kind of pub that everyone wishes they had in their lives. Just like MaClaren's on \"How I Met Your Mother.\" The ambiance is so cozy and snug, the waitstaff knows all the locals and vice versa, it's just the perfect a weekly gathering place with dozens of little nooks and crannies, backrooms and cubby-holes to be as social (or not) as you'd like!   Their nachos are astronomical, the Shepard's Pie was delicious and the beer selection is as broad as a pub's beer selection should be. My only complaint was their soda bread. It was very dry. It came with butter, but I think a dipping glaze would've been better suited to make it more palatable...but maybe that's what beer is for!    Come early to snag a good parking spot and a table in the front room for Trivia on Tuesday nights. It starts at 8pm and usually wraps around 10:30pm with a Grand Prize bar tab of $100 and $50 for 2nd Place.    I love that there is a separate room (and entrance) for the gaming bar where smoking is permitted. And while there is some smoke crossover from the bar staff's open window, it's generally not too bad (and I'm very sensitive to smoke!)   The bar AND the kitchen are open 24/7!",

Jessica was my waitress and offered up plenty of suggestions for today but also had suggestions for me to come back and try in the future. I was impressed on how helpful the staff was. I always associated heavy food with McMullan's. They have a lot of lighter choices for our hot weather here in las vegas. Today I had a simple salad and soup. They also have a schedule on the menu for the Live Entertainment of the month. After my lunch today I made a reservation for later in the month. I know this is going to be a great place for Business lunches from now on.  Thank you McMullan's",

We started with a flight number two of Irish whiskey as recommended by our waitress! Wonderful!! I now have a new favorite Irish whiskey,Powers Signature. My boyfriend and I each had a cup(big as a bowl at other places) of corn chowder. A tiny bit on the salty side but very creamy and corn flavor! We then split a steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. Tender and cooked to perfection.  Our friend had Casies favorite, steak and mushroom pie. WOW! Do not miss this disj! Flaky crust, tender steak. No room for dessert this time but we will be back. They are Open 24 hours.",

The fish & chips rival Gordon Ramsey's pub at Caesar's for 1/3 of the price.  The rest of the fare is authentic Irish and the tap has all the Irish beers you could want (Murphy's, Guinness, Killians, Tennents, Harps, etc. etc. etc.) with an excellent selection of whiskies.  Once inside you feel like you've been transported to Ireland.  Even many of the waiters are from Ireland and are beyond friendly.   Great live Irish music usually on Friday's and Saturday's.   Lots of little nooks to have a more private and intimate experience just like in Ireland. All you can eat fish & chips on Thursdays.  Do not leave without getting the sticky toffee pudding and an Irish coffee.   Best Irish coffee I've ever had. 5 stars hands down.",

You should write to our owner and get a new card.\" I never did.  I did however, return in the summertime, and came to find that my card, did indeed, work.  Same card. Hmm. That's strange.   Why didn't the bartender tell me there was a to go charge?  He charged my card without even telling me that there was a to go charge.  I was eating it there but wanted it in a to go box.  I had already paid though, so there was nothing he could do.   1/22/18- Bartender: \" Me: \"...?\" Bartender: *walks away quick enough for me to not even be able to ask what he meant.  He goes to the smoking session and does stuff on the computer. He eventually brings us menus* Server lady: *Does nothing. Stares at us.*  O..Kay?  I walked out.   --- I've been coming to McMullans since 2010.  It hasn't been the same in a long time. A very long time.   I've been getting the $10 off your meal special for four years now, and elected not to use it for 2016 and 2017 because in 2015, a bartender lied to me and told me that my McCraic card was not working.  He refused to give me my discount.   I thought tonight would be different, so I made my way there after work to enjoy some delicious Irish nachos.  Nope.   --- 3/15/18 Come in for a bite and a drink since I'm stuck in the area, and the waiter seems hesitant to serve me, as if I'm poor or something.  Ask him about pulling up my membership, and tell him about my situation with my McCraic card \"never working\" here.  He brings me a new address for the card form, but doesn't acknowledge me or it for forty minutes, instead talks to this couple next to me.  The only time he acknowledged me was to take my order, ask if I wanted anything other than my drink, and then to close my tab.   The heavyset bartender ignored me the entire hour I was here, but after seeing me talk to a waiter,  He then asked me if I had a to go order (I wanted extra compliments to go with my meal)  I had to tell him: lI had a waiter take care of it.  This is the first time you've talked to me.\"  My original bartender then came to talk to me ten minutes later and I told him that I had a waiter take care of it.   I can't believe how hard it is to be taken care of by the bartenders here.   The waiter did never get a manager over to me.",

If I came here with my boyfriend every Saturday to watch the Hawkeyes play I'd be in some serious trouble! Let me start off by saying I am SO happy that they separate the gaming/smoking from the non-gaming/non-smoking side. I can finally sit at a bar and enjoy myself without having someone light up their cigarette right next to me or ask me to move so they can use the slot I'm sitting at. Now to the food! I am addicted to the Irish Nachos and lemon pepper wings. I don't know what kind of magic they have going on in the kitchen but their wings are the best I've ever had. They are extra crispy, but the meat is juicy and definitely not greasy.  The service is great. I truly enjoy the Irish accents all the bartenders have. And I'll add one last thing. Do yourself a favor and get an Irish coffee. Even if you don't like coffee. One of the best decisions you'll ever make in your life!",

Sorry I can't remember what time their happy hour is. It just happens that every time I go, it's happy hour! Anyways, it's half off for HH. Do get the fish and chips, nachos (with or without meat), and chicken wings.  Service: Eh, depending on whom your bartender/server is. It's a hit or miss.

It also comes with a side of tartar and coleslaw. As an appetizer we had the corn chowder. The soup was hot, creamy & tasty. They also provide a daily craft beer worth trying.",

    "text": "Last week, at a Private Event, I had my first experience at an Irish Pub since a family trip to the UK almost a decade ago...  McMullan's is located directly West of the Orleans Casino, just across the street, in fact. And it's only a short walk from the Strip, if you're so inclined... probably less than a 10 minute walk.  Once you enter McMullan's Irish Pub... this is as authentic as you can get without the expense of flying over the Atlantic... the Ale-induced atmosphere with every breath you take... the musky aroma from the dark wood paneling in each room... Banners & Jerseys hanging from the rafters of all the beloved Soccer teams in the Isles. After conversing with some of the wait-staff, McMullan's brought over the whole interior of an Irish Pub plank by plank, piece by piece. Never saw or been in as large a Pub in the UK... probably an American thing... or a Las Vegas thing...  The Private Event 's menu consisted of the following...  First Course - Fine Old-Fashioned Greens with Tomatoes, Onions, Carrots, Cucumber & Herb Croutons. Dressing: Ranch or Balsamic Vinaigrette.  (** 1/2) The Irish (nor the English) never did Salads well despite the abundance of Ranch Dressing, which I ordered with the Salad.   Second Course  (one of the following...) -  ) Coast Road Inn Fish & Chips - Named for the Old Family Pub back in Ireland! Three Beer-Battered North Atlantic Cod Fillets with Frieds, Coleslaw & Tartar Sauce.  ) A Lighter Bite - Succulent, Blackened Chicken served with a medley of fresh, sauteed Vegetables.   Comment - Don't do Chicken at a Pub. Never. Ever! And it's Blackened, at that! You will NOT find this entree in the Isles... I guarantee it! Half the table of eight ordered this Entree. No one finished this Entree... No One! It seemed only one of the three Fillets were even consumed.  ) Steak & Mushroom Irish Pie - Tuck in to an Irish Tradition! A wonderful, flaky Crusted Pie, served with Mashed Potatoes and Peas. (*****) Two of my kids ate at my table... Like Dad, they also ordered the Steak & Mushroom Pie... avoiding the Blackened Chicken. (I taught them well!) Very authentic. And I mean authentic! About 5\" round Pie with a LOT of Meat and thickly sliced Mushrooms and Gravy. The crust is better than I remembered... American influence? With a mound of Mashed Potatoes and Peas on the side. Bland in flavor, just as you'd find in the UK. I commented to the rest of the table that the Gravy to be poured over the Mashed Potatoes was Whiskey-laced. Guess what? All the Blackened-Chicken Diners asked for some Gravy... which was poured over their Chicken. This was as humorous as heck! This didn't help their appetites, unfortunately... most of the Blackened Chicken remained on their plates.  Just remember, Irish and English food is Hearty and Robust... and are known to be not very flavorful. The Steak & Mushroom Pie is very authentic... for sure.  Third Course - Sticky Toffee Pudding - The traditional Irish Dessert. Get Stuck In!   (****) This was not a Pudding, per se... It was a Toffee Pudding Cake. Very Sweet, Very Sticky... not enough of it! The Dessert was a Spongy, dark Cake soaked (probably for hours) in a thick Toffee Sauce. I WANT MORE! Came with a Cup of Coffee (***) which was uneventful...  Hard Cider (*****) Two tall glasses of Cider, just as I remember from the Euro trip! More alcoholic, less sweet than Cider found here in the United States.  Just remember when dining Irish or English... Don't order Chicken anything!  Slainte!",

Plus, the bartenders give me grief when I ask for wine; I order a coffee with Baileys, Kahlua and Frangelico but it's never that great. I end up staring at my mug wondering why I let myself be convinced into visiting another Irish Pub.  But, I like McMullan's better than most Irish bars.  McMullan' isn't smokey. The place is a little dark, but the band on Friday night is really upbeat and fun. They play Violent Femmes and Van Morrison. I recommend going on Friday nights if only for the music.  My first visit to McMullan's was on a pub quiz night when I drove my team's score straight into the ground. Like George Bush, I went with my gut and encouraged my teammates to follow my instincts. We lost. Bad. Pub quiz night is really fun though.   I've always had a great time at McMullan's and will return next time someone pressures me into it.",

Be it Football, Fuutball, or good ole Rugby, something is always playing.   They pour Guinness the correct way.   They make a delicious Shepherds Pie. If you ask for it with cheese it's simply out of this world. The Dinner portion I can barely finish. The Reuben is pretty damn good too.   Pints are $6 each but well worth it.   There's normally bar space open, or if you want a private party you can request a secluded booth.   Every time I go back to Vegas I always pop in for a crisp pint of Smithwicks.",

Service was friendly (the kid didn't stop smiling the whole time we were there), just attentive enough and the atmosphere is a welcome respite from the brutal desert sun - dark, welcoming, cozy.  I ordered Ann's Blackened Chicken Salad, which was boldly flavorful, topped with crispy onion straws and vegetables like red peppers and corn in addition to more traditional salad accoutrements. The Creole mustard dressing was superb.  Definitely want to go back here again, the menu seems a lot more tempting than your usual video poker pub.",

    "text": "This visit to Las Vegas was supposed to be for a wedding until the bride and groom decided that they were gonna go there separate ways. The father of the bride was nice enough to rent a huge party limo with doolies and get all of us together for dinner and rented one of the private rooms here at McMullans.  When the limo went of the strip I was a little nervous, and being my first time in an Irish joint, I was really nervous. That feeling didn't last long let me tell you.  The father of the bride Jim stood up proudly, and thanked us for making the trip and joining his family in this tough time. He then showed his appreciation by announcing a full bar and dinner buffet on him.  The bartenders were super friendly and poured a great beer.  They put out some appetizers as we all sat around the round tables sharing our stories of how the bride and groom brought us together.  By the time the dinner bell was rang we were all pretty shit faced.  I couldn't even tell you what all they had to eat.  They did have some off the best fish in chips I've ever had.  It was served with a homemade tarter sauce, fresh lemons and some one at the table turned me on to Malt vinegar for my fries.  The bartenders went above and beyond, clearing plates seconds after my fork hit the middle of the plate as I pushed it away from me.  Drinks were refilled promptly so I didn't even have to get up after I got my buzz.  I would like to personally thank the fine folks of McMullans for putting on great dinner and it was a night we will talk about for years to come.",

I did not eat here because upon arrival, the host (who wasn't at the stand when we came in, but had to wait several minutes for him to appear) just walked up and said flatly, \"There's no room here. We're full.\"  My mother, sister and I (all well dressed and very presentable) stared at him in shock at his rudeness, and he said, \"We have trivia tonight and there's a soccer game.\"  The place was indeed very full, and we had come hoping to play the trivia (and were about 20 minutes early for trivia), but there are better ways to handle this, such as merely being nice to potential customers.  Needless to say, this was a total turnoff to ever try coming back to this place.",

I will admit, since coming to Vegas McMullan's has been one of my favorite bars. It is actually one of my favorite bars ever. We've celebrated multiple birthdays here, and I had part of my bachelor party here. Our most recent experience just exemplified my love for this place.  The place was hopping as the next day was a holiday, and Darby O'Gill was playing. I like McMullan's for their intimate stage for live music. It may be loud, but it really makes for a hell of a time. The bar area was pretty packed, so we made our way to a little corner to the right of the bar. The area was pretty full with a couple large parties...and as typical for McMullan's, we ran into some people we know...which is always a nice treat.   We were greeted almost immediately be our waitress. One we've had a few times, who happens to be Irish. Yet another reason I love McMullan's. They are the only authentic Irish bar in town as it is owned by an Irishman and they have at least one Irishwoman on the wait staff. I got my usual Smithwicks, and the wife had a Mangers. We decided to split the Irish Nachos (oh so delicious).   Not relevant to  this visit, but McMullan's is also a sponsor and host of St. Baldricks, a charity event to raise money to fight childhood cancer. They are the longest standing sponsor in Las Vegas, and have the largest event for this charity here. I can always get behind a place that likes to support the community, while providing a great product for the community.  These are just a few of the reasons I will keep coming back to McMullan's.",

    "text": "I came here for a late night dinner of fish and chips after hearing so much about his place.    The place was packed and pretty noisy due to a U2 cover band playing that evening.  I sat in the dinning area, which was 1 or 2 decibels quieter.  I opted for the fish and chips as well as the home made crisps for an app.  The homemade crisps were very good.  The sauces that came with them were hit and miss.  The curry was a hit, the other one (whose name escapes me) was a big miss.  As for the entree, the portions were quite generous: three big peices of cod.  The fish were not breaded too heavily and were flaky, but there wasn't too much flavor to them.  Unfortunately, even with the tartar sauce, not too much was added in terms of flavor.  The fries were average, freshly made and absorbing the vinegar nicely.  The cole slaw was nothing special and forgettable.    Service was above average considering there was a bar full of patrons next door and only one waiter.  Overall the tab came out to about $25 with tax and tip, a bit on the steep side for a single diner.    If you do come here, you might want to try for one of their specials (eg AYCE fish and chips on Thursdays) to make the price and overall experience a little more palatable.  Also remember this is a pub, so there are drunk people with bad judgement around: when leaving the place I almost got caught up in a brawl between a group of 6 and a group of 2.  Luckily, I escaped any drama by quickly and quietly walking to my car.",

There are two bars and thankfully one of them does *not* have any embedded video gambling machines (which are far too prevalent, IMO).   The portions at McMullan's are huge. This time, Erin Ashley & I ordered a half-size Irish Nachos w/ Beef appetizer and a Texas BBQ Burger with fries to share. The nachos are piled high with homemade potato chips, melted cheese, tomatoes, green onions, sour cream and seasoned ground beef (I typically go for chicken, but this ground beef is pretty impressive). The burger was a stack of breaded onion rings, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, sauteed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crunchy bacon, a patty cooked-to-order and smothered in BBQ sauce between a toasted sesame seed bun. I'm surprised at just how well the pickles went with everything. Oh, and the fries were top notch.   The only thing I'd change is the ketchup (not thick enough for my tastes).   We ended up taking over 2/3 of the nachos home with us and plan to snack on them for the rest of the day.   I'm looking forward to coming back and trying out their Whiskey Samplers and Beer Samplers with some friends.  If you liked this review, be sure to follow me as I eat my way through Las Vegas.",

Now, that being said the food is AWESOME!!!   The service ala Ryan was top notch. The beer selection well what can I say GREAT.    We had the nachos, half size, couldn't stop eating them, enough for 4 but there were only two of us and we killed it.  Not proud of that but YUM!  The trio gave us a taste of three dishes, stew, Sheppard's pie and what else, corned beef and cabbage.  Again what can I say FANTASTIC, all three.  No preservatives, fresh home cooking no aftertaste of any kind.  Stuffed to the gills, Ryan said you have to at least hear about desert.  Needless to stay we chose two to go and after I finish this review and in about two hours we will dive into both and I am sure after looking at them that they will not disappoint.

I may have not calculated the time zone change correctly, but showed up an hour and a half early for the game.

Even just their burgers and standard bar food are all great and I've never had something subpar here to eat.  I feel like most of the bartenders I see have been the same ones over the years I've been coming here, which is a positive sign to me of an establishment that is well run and takes pride in the way they conduct business.  They frequently have live music and special events.  Also a great place to watch rugby and sports of that nature... not my thing, but just thought I'd throw it in there.  I love McMullan's!",

    "text": "As someone who is constantly on the lookout for a great pot pie or fish and chips, McMullan's is our current top pick for an Irish pub in Vegas.  Their rendition of fish and chips ($14.50) ranks up there with the best. Three large beer-battered fillets, served piping hot, laid on top of a mound of fries makes for a generous portion. The batter was light, crispy, and avoided the excessive oiliness found with most beer-based batters. The tartar sauce, however, could use some more tangy tartness to balance out the mayo. Their chips were midsized steak fries and nicely crisped on the outside. The coleslaw was good but not particularly noteworthy. Those with strong appetites for fried fish should consider the AYCE fish and chips on Thursdays from 5pm to 11pm.   Their Irish pies ($12) are filled with either chicken curry or steak and mushroom and take about 25 minutes to prepare. You can't go wrong with either one. The pie pastry itself impressed us because it completely enveloped the filling all around without the support of a ramekin and remained perfectly crisp and flaky despite the hearty stew of steak and mushrooms or satisfying chicken curry awaiting inside. Tasty accompaniments included buttered peas and a somewhat plain mashed potatoes with a small pot of delicious brown (sherry?) gravy.  The genuine ambience of an Irish pub is successfully recreated in the midst of dark wooden paneling and servers speaking with True Irish accents. Unfortunately taking the authenticity a bit too far, the service can be on the slow side. Prices, while not inexpensive, are reasonable for the quality and generous serving sizes. If you plan on becoming a regular, you should ask to sign up for the McCraic card, their free customer loyalty rewards program. With food this good, why wouldn't you? Most convenient of all, it is open 24/7.",

I am staying in the area without a car, so I needed to find a place to eat within walking distance of where I am staying.  I found this on yelp and decided to try it based on the high average rating.  Now I am wonder if the bar is different here, if this is a different place, or if I hit a bad night.  I started with the house salad,  Hard to mess up and it was OK.  I am uncertain how it was dressed as all the dressing was on the stuff on the bottom of the plate while the top was basically sans dressing.   My entree was the Steak and Mushroom Irish Pie.  The pie itself was fine, adequately seasoned, served very hot and tasty.  The mashed potatoes seemed to have come from a box; they had the unmistakable flavor and texture of rehydrated potato product, not something made from fresh potatoes.  The gravy tasted like it came from a can.  And the peas were unmistakably from the freezer.  What?  It is the season for fresh peas, the produce markets are filled with them  And there is no excuse for not using fresh potatoes.  The staff was great and friendly, but the food is a definite 'pass' for me.",

Upon walking in, this Irish joint was rocking and rolling with a live band and I could see everyone was having a good time. It was awesome!  But then, I realized something was missing...  It was cigarette smoke! I couldn't believe I finally found a place in Sin City where I could have live music and some top-notch whiskey varieties smoke-free! My green hat's off to you, McMullan's. And if you're a smoker, no worries. You can smoke in the gaming side of the bar.   Now the bar unfortunately didn't have Killian's on draft (I saw a lit Killian's sign which got my hopes up), but the bar made up for it by having a better-than-average selection of scotch and Irish whiskeys- but come on: drinking a scotch in an Irish pub? -Pog mo thoin!-  All in all, I'm definitely going back to McMullan's. My birthday's coming up in a few weeks, and I saw they have some private booths for groups, right near the live band stage. This pub caters to a broad audience, so I know everyone in my eclectic group of friends have a genuinely good time.",

It has a really nice feeling to it.  They have a good selection of beer. They also have 4 samplers of beers, each sampler comes with 5 different type of Irish Beer and it only costs $5. I have to try that next time.   I ordered the french fries ($4) and fried chicken appetizers ($8), both are nicely prepared, not too greasy, good amount of food. When the tab arrive, I realized that we got 50% off for the appetizers, they told us that everyday from 11pm to 2am is happy hour, 50% off for all the appetizers. I love it when I saved money when I'm not expecting it. Overall I really like this place. I will be back for sure. Especially to try out their beer samplers.",

So I used my trusty YELP phone app and found McMullan open.  We said WTF let's do it.   Now keep in mind this place is NOT on the strip.  IT's about 2 miles off the strip (Right next to the Orleans), but so worth it.  When we got there it had good music playing and cool people that are friendly and bartenders that are in good graces at 3 a.m.  Been to many places were the bartenders just want to call it a night.    WE drank, sang, and had a great time until 8 a.m. in the morning.  I can't wait to go back and have myself a nice pint or an Irish Car bomb.  Great place and worth the trip outside the strip.",

    "text": "How good is McMullen's Irish Pub?    Well, I could tell you about the excellent selection of whiskey (one of the best in Vegas).  We could discuss the delicious menu with classic pub fare and inventive food twists.  You could be told about the great Tuesday trivia night that is always a fun time.  They could boast about the crowd of Irishmen who come to watch soccer matches, rugby games and Celtic sports on early Sunday mornings.  He (the singer of one of the Irish music bands that play there) could tell you about the raucous music nights and great sounds of an Irish fiddle that drift about the bar on many nights.  Or I could simply say this: McMullen's is virtually hidden from the public view.  Directions to the business usually involve referring to landmarks rather than addresses: \"You go over to the Orleans and turn north, then go behind a gas station and it's right there\".  It is mostly obscured from the street, but that doesn't matter.    The pub is so well put together--from the wood on the bar to the stones in the walls to the perfect pour of Guinness--that it remains a popular Vegas bar for folks to get a drink.  So go find Vegas' best Irish pub hidden behind that gas station.  You'll thank yourself for making the journey.",

I had the shepard's pie, and was very pleased with my choice.  The portion was huge and once again I ate way too much.  My daughter had the mac 'n cheese and ate everything we put on her plate, which rarely happens.  So, it's safe to assume that the mac 'n cheese is good too.  And finally- the fish and chips.  My husband reports that the fish is absolutely delicious but the batter needs a little something more.  All in all, he liked it alot, but it still searching for something even better.  The one downer- The service was awful! Our waiter rarely checked on us and when he asked us if we wanted refills, it was about 20 minutes before we got our drinks.  My husband had to eat most of his meal without a drink. :(     We will definitely be back to McMullan's, with the hopes of getting a different server...",

What I've had in the past: fish & chips, corned beef hash & cabbage, shepard's pie and some soup that I can't remember if my life depended on it.  The fish was moist and fried perfectly. Fries are fries, nothing special. Corned beef hash were served in slices on top of cabbage with some stock. I thought it was a bit too salty but nonetheless it was delicious!!! Shepard's pie made me feel like a heifer after eating it :\\ lots o' mashed potaters!  Staff are pretty chill, always a lot of people at the bar, this place is a bit pricey but totally worth a try! Can't wait for my next visit!  Oh, btw they have a full bar and a large variety of beers!",

One of the best I've had ever. Huge portions too. The batter is perfectly light and crisp. The fries weren't seasoned so, season away. The fish and the fries weren't greasy and gross.

The gravy that came with the fries and gravy was delicious but not overly salty at all. The bits o fish (small appetizer size of fish and chips) were hot and crisp. Beers and ciders during happy hour are $1 off as well. (:  We went on a Friday and there was live music, the whole place was full, and everyone seemed to be in a jolly mood (is it the alcohol?). We were a little lost at first, waiting for a table to be cleared up, but that was handled promptly once we were noticed by a host.  McMullan's was a great first pub experience.

    "text": "Enjoyed the Farmhouse Irish Breakfast which consisted of eggs, sausage, Irish bacon, baked beans, grilled tomato, and breakfast potatoes. Delicious food and the coffee was delicious. The server was very friendly and worked her b*** off. Unfortunately she was the only one serving so if we needed anything we had to wait a bit. It also took a while before the cooks prepared our food.   I didn't give it 5 stars because the service wasn't the best and because the restroom needed much attention. The paper towels were overflowing the trash can :/   The food was delicious but expect slow service in the mornings and not so clean restrooms.   UPDATE: Visited the restaurant a second time and the food was delicious, once again but this time the service was outstanding. This is a nice hidden gem in Las Vegas! By the way, this place is open 24/7!",

There's a great atmosphere on football days especially when Liverpool are playing.   They have a number of tvs so you will never miss the action. It has that British/Irish feel along with some amazing food.   The fish and chips are the best.   From my experiences having been here a number of times the servers are friendly. They take care of you as fast as possible and even on the busier days there service for me was still really good.   For me it's a pub, great atmosphere, great people who are friendly.

Even the type of chips they used were delicious. I didn't even notice until midway through that they use kettle chips. Even the meat gave it a stew like flavor. The amount of cheese and sour cream are perfect  Now I only ever order the shepherds pie. It is delicious. And it is a True shepherds pie with lamb. They give you amazing portions here.  I will definitely be back. If you want to come here to eat but don't like your crowd, come here on a weekday or a no ongame night.",

Many are friendly and social in a good way. It seems a more older crowd in here.  The entry bar and inside seating areas tend to attract the more younger crowd. There is even outside seating.   Lots of parking. Also, just a short walk from The Orleans Casino.  Oh yeah, the drink sizes are those Imperial Pint glass sizes for the Irish libations.",

Its decadent, authentic, rustic, artsy, lively and has some of the best Irish food and entertainment! Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays they offer a live Irish band that plays all through the evening. They even wear traditional kilts and do some fun Irish dancing.  Lots of private dining areas and the decor is splendid!  We had a very fun lively Scottish waitress named Susan. She was super friendly and very attentive.  I had the most outstanding order of Fish/Chips I have ever had(the coleslaw was even superb!). I savored every bite as it went down my pie hole. LOL. My sister had the chicken fingers/ fries and my Mom had the traditional corn-beef and cabbage(which she loved).  Desert...Sticky Toffee Pudding.

Entertainer John Windsor with his wit and soothing voice brings additional charm to this family-owned Irish pub.  Small town neighborhood feel with great good. We wanted to stay all night.  Amazing whiskey collection.  Wings are fantastic.  Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.  To make it even better for us, they have our favorite Japanese whiskey in their collection: Yamazake.  Total gem in Las Vegas.",

We had the bangers and mash for a dinner a few years back and they were a little on the bland side. Would not recommend. We will continue our early afternoon pints and the wonderful mini-sausages on future trips because these flavorful apps had to be invented by a True beer lover. Sorry, no pictures... I blame that on my wife, certainly not on the pints.",

The bartenders are usually really quick with the service and bring the drinks with haste. They also have a points card if you are looking to come here often and play on the machines.  There are two or three different rooms, and the other one has live music in it. I did not mind at all being in the other room, because they had TV showing the game and it was a lot less noisy.  Bathroom is alright, a little dim lighting but it's clean! There's additional parking right beside the side of the building, where some people park.",

    "text": "Simplicity is the way to go with McMullan's. A few friends and I stooped by for their happy hour since they are one of the few that offer one on a Sunday. Without further delay I will announce that their happy hour is 7 days a week from 3-6.   The savings are not on the drink since our beers averaged six dollars a piece, but the appetizers are half off. Even though the list was short, the fish and chips bites ($4) were nice. The batter on fish was light in texture and color. Instead of over burning them, it came out crisp and I did not have to dab each piece with a napkin. We had also ordered the sausage rolls ($4) since that is a safe bet for those who have an allergy to soy. The rest of their food is deep fried in a vegetable oil, so avoid if you cannot tolerate soy. The rolls were so good that we ordered a second helping. An order of sliders ($12) were also a hit. The sirloin with grill onions and mushrooms topped with BBQ were so tender. The reuben was also delicious. The piles of meat made the three mini burgers overwhelming. With a huge helping of fries, no wonder my friend was stopped dead in his tracks. The Blackthorn and Magner Ciders were a nice refreshing way to end our night. The bill came out to $57 with a total of six beers, three happy hour appetizers, and the sliders.  On Sundays at 6:30, they have live music. The audience is given a list of songs that they can request.",

They do have beer specials for every day of the week but none of the days include Guinness.  Old Murphy's and Harp was on there.  The others were non-Irish beers.    Back to the food.  The fish was slightly overcooked and not very well seasoned.  I wasn't a huge fan of the breading.  The fries were slightly over cooked and over seasoned.  My friend had the shepherds pie and he liked it a lot.  I will have to return when I can have a drink, but I think I'll pass on the food.",

    "text": "Alright, my earlier review was filtered for some reason (kinda offended there, but meh).  So lets try again a few years later eh?  I love this place.  I used to love it more, but for a while there they lost my business.  I went to McMullans to get away from the Sports-Bar & Grill vibe of most places in town, and then one day they got rid of all their Irish/Celtic musicians and replaced them with some, in my opinion, typically low end Vegas garage band types and tacked a bunch of Wranglers (local Hockey team) memorabilia.  And it stayed that way for a good long while.  Now, mind you, it's not that I hate sports, I actually enjoy watching Gaelic league football and the like, it's more the fact that they went out of their way to cater to the Hockey crowd while pushing away it's old loyal customer base.  I stopped going for about a year.  This all being said, they seem to be making a return to the \"little slice of Ireland tucked away in Las Vegas\" vibe they had years ago when I first started going there, and that makes me happy.  So, lets hope they can keep that up. Oh!  Yeah, the food and drinks.  Just as good as ever.  Probably some of the best food I've eaten in Las Vegas, and I've lived here for 15 years.  Get the Irish Nachos . . . seriously . . . like, if you're one person, a mini is fine . . . don't even try to tackle their monster of a full order by yourself.",

Last time my boyfriend and I came in and the place was completely empty except the sole bartender there. After having to tell him how to make a bay breeze he finally took our order. Food was good and fast ( the reason why they even got 2 stars) but after telling the bartender we were ready for the check and my boyfriend drunk going to the bathroom Comming back and then just went to the car while I waited for another ten mins for the bartender to stop playing with salts. Pretty sure he was hammered. Which must be the case every night because I have not once left there without asking myself if the good food was worth the shitty service.

Thank goodness for containers to go!  Beer on tap is always a plus. Our waitress was Susan, she's just wonderful!  Kept us happy the entire time. Thank you,  Susan!

    "text": "This review is for the Tuesday Night Trivia experience.  I've been to this event about 20 times now, and lately the experience has gone downhill exponentially.  Two weeks ago, we had a group of 7 people. Everyone knows that you need a sacrificial lamb or two to go early (around 6 - 6:30) to get a table so that you're set by the time everyone arrives for trivia at 8pm.  (Or later, if your friends are anything like mine)  Well I was the lamb, as usual, and though there were 3 of us by the time 7pm rolled around, we were still admonished by our British waiter that we can't hold a table for 6-8 people if we only have 3 people.  I told him, \"We will have 6 or 7.\"  He continued on about how it wasn't right, so I said, \"What about that guy over there, he's only got one person!\"  The waiter replied, \"Well he will have more people come later.\"  Yeah, I told him, SO WILL WE.  So annoying.  (Spoiler alert:  by the end of the night, we had 7 people, and the other dude only had one other person join him.  SMH.)  If only admonishing us was the last of the shitty service, but alas, it wasn't.  We were treated poorly for not ordering enough alcohol, daring to ask for refills of coffee or water, and for the audacity to ask for separate checks.  No one thing was that egregious (other than the unnecessary scolding) but the cumulative effect was almost enough to make me never want to return.  Yet return I did the following week, but I asked to sit in another section.  Last week seemed so much more promising.  I sat on the other side, asked for a table for 5 and commenced waiting for the rest of my party..... they were all especially late, much to my waitress' chagrin.  And, unbeknownst to me (and the McMullan's staff), the entire room I was in began to fill up due to an impromptu memorial for some dead guy.  I began to get nervous because all these people were filling up a room beyond capacity and leaving no room for my teammates (when they finally did arrive).  One mourner saw my distress and assured me they would be leaving before trivia.  I didn't believe him, though, because some of his other compatriots were just ordering food and it was nearly 7:45pm.  Sure enough, by the time trivia started, I couldn't hear a word they said over the loud speaker, and none of the mourners were upset enough to keep quiet despite multiple people yelling, \"SHHHHH!!!!\"   Some people playing trivia up and left, so my party moved over to their table where it was just slightly quieter.  I was beyond disgruntled (especially because our order of Irish Nachos still hadn't come out of the kitchen 45 minutes later).  By the end of the night, we heard most of the questions, but ended up in 11th place.  If we were in contention, I would have been livid because the mourners had formed their own team of 17 people (though 8 is the max), and they won first place, despite having cell phones out and running between rooms sharing answers with other people.  It's hard to take a bar trivia seriously when everyone talks and cheats.  What's the point?  It surely isn't fun because it was anything but....  McMullan's should really police room capacity and trivia cheating.  Until then, I won't be returning.",

I wish I could eat here everyday! The fish and chips were delicious and the fish was so fresh, not farm raised. I ate the corned beef cabbage entree which was served with some homemade brown bread. It was better than any corned beef dish I have ever had and they get their flour for their homemade brown bread from England. What topped the night were the TVs they had to watch the Seahawk's game. What a great place!",

    "text": "Myself and family stopped in Sunday morning for breakfast. We chose to sit in the gaming side as someone in my party smokes.  Ordered three full Irish breakfasts and coffees, service was terrible from the arrival. The bartender had all the personally traits of a tree stump.   Coffee was served fairly quickly but with no cream/sugar... in the 35 minutes to get our breakfast without one return visit from the bartender. two of us had managed to lose a combined $220 on their blackjack machines, we couldn't win a hand. Tough luck.   Breakfast was served and again the bartender disappeared, my silverware was filthy and I like to enjoy my eggs with salt and pepper, but no sign of the bartender anywhere to ask for such standards condiments and clean utensils, the eggs went cold and still no sign of him, so eventually I decided to eat the meal without the needed salt pepper and ketchup for my now cold potatoes.  The breakfast was terrible, greasy, cold - one of my crew ate perhaps 15% of the meal and when they took the plate away they didn't even inquire,\"how was it?\" They obviously didn't care, or already knew.   After we all agreed it was the worst service and sub par food of any recent outing, we decided to get our Check and leave...not kidding, to get the attention of the bartender and then get our check took 27 minutes (I know because the football game on tv had a countdown timer).  When the $70ish Check finally arrived my patience was already thin because of the lack of service and I asked that if I'd lost over $160 in the machine did that effect the bill? (I know how gaming comps go but wanted to be polite), \"I can comp your coffee\" was the answer! Wow. Ok I thought. \"And just out of curiosity how much would someone need to lose to get a breakfast comped?\" I asked. The bartender said \"more than you\".   With that, we paid the bill and all vowed to never return. There are better Irish/English bars in town, that treat people nicer... McMullens once was great, but no longer. I'll never return and feel so strongly about it I have written this report and will actively tell my friends who might go there to stay clear.   Save your time and money and go elsewhere. We work too hard for our money to support lacklustre staff. Next Sunday we're trying the Crown and Anchor.",

    "text": "Oh My Dear God...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with one word: horrendous.   My boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional.   When we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender \"Chris\" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously).  My boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude \"ya.\" Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out.   As we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS.   Also, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.  *Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored. Not matter what.",

They have local bands come and play and have trivia night every Tuesday at 8 which is an insane amount of fun.",

The service is normally good, not fast but polite and almost always in a good mood.

Even the waitress we had spoke with a heavy Irish accent which made the trip there that much more fun.  Not to mention, they have Boddingtons on tap, a great cream ale.  2 beers, 1 large app, 1 dinner, and 1 dessert only cost us $39.  Now i cant wait to go back to Vegas just to come here again.

My husband had been going on about these Irish nachos he had during a boys night, so I had to give it a try. Let me tell you, they're AMAZING! We shared a half order, and barely finished it. It sits on a huge plate, and piled high. He forgot to add the corned beef topping, so we'll have to go back for that. I was full for the rest of the day - just that alone filled me up. Maybe we will go for the mini order next time.   Looking through the menu, I saw a few things that I NEED to try. Their shepherds pie for one. That is comfort food at its finest. AND FINALLY a place that serves pasties!!! Of course I didn't get to try that either, but I will!!  This review will be updated as soon as i'm able to try everything else on the menu",

While it didn't fully taste like clam chowder it had an excellent flavor. You could taste the clams, and there was a good number of clams in the soup, but is had more of a potato chowder flavor...an excellent potato chowder mind you!  The Irish stew was phenomenal. The roast melted in your mouth. The potatoes, carrots, and onions were flavorful. The gravy was simply divine. This alone is bringing me back!  My partners Irish Breakfast was complete, ample and very flavorful. See photos.  No restaurant is perfect. If there was to be a demerit given it would be the lack of light in the place. It was difficult to read the menus. The decor was appropriate and appreciated but it just dampened the light.",

I went to Ireland and tried many different restaurants. This place is definitely the closest to an authentic Irish establishment. Came here once for dinner and it can tend to get a bit noisy. I enjoyed the party ambiance that this place had to offer in the nighttime. I found The Scotch egg to be very interesting, but in a good way. The service is always top notch! This place is also great for picking up food to go. I tend to get the Shepherds pie to go. It is still piping hot by the time I get home, so no need to throw it in the oven. If you are in Vegas and are in the mood for some excellent authentic Irish food, well this is the place to be!",

    "text": "It's a very nice oasis from the desert heat.  We ordered appetizer Bits o Fish & Chips, Chips & Curry Sauce, Steak and Mushroom Pasty, and fountain drinks.  The server told us to expect about a 25 minutes wait for the pasty.  We were okay with that as we had ordered a couple of appetizers.  During the course of our meal two different servers kept our drinks refilled and food service smooth.  The kitchen took a long time with our appetizers so the waitress offered us a complimentary dessert.  We received the appetizers with the entree about 25 minutes after ordering.  The fish & chips were very good.  The fish coating was crunchy and not greasy; the chips (aka fries) had a good potato taste and were as good as I'd expected.  The curry sauce is very good as well.  The steak and mushroom pasty was hot (temp) and savory; I'm very pleased with it.  Peas, mashed potatoes and onion gravy are served with the pasty.  They were also very good as well.  We're not fans of the onion gravy.  I would describe it as a highly concentrated onion flavor.  It was a nice cool temperature in the dimly lit bar & restaurant.  I used a flash on some of the pictures in order to help see the details of the food.  It is highly decorated venue on a backdrop of wood architectural features.  Irish themed music plays in the background; loud enough to hear it but also carry on a conversation.  My imagination works overtime here and at times I imagine pirates hanging out in one of the many alcoves.  If there are other people there making noise, it helps add to the atmosphere.  Arrrgh!  The waitress had offered us a dessert of Bread Pudding to compensate for the lengthy time it took to get the appetizers.  I'm so glad we took her up on this offer.  It was the best bread pudding I've had in decades!  So delicious.  It definitely made up for the wait.  The bread pudding is homemade, topped with custard that's drizzled with a whiskey glaze.  Mmmmmmm!  We will be back!",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, Irish cuisine is not something I get a lot of.  However, I wanted to get out of the Orleans and this place is super close, at least if you exit from the doors towards the parking garage.  It's literally across the street.  So I couldn't try their award-winning fish and chips, but I knew from their menu (helpfully posted outside) that there was food I could eat here (clearly marked with a V!).  Basically the only vegetarian options are the veggie burger or a salad, but for Irish/Vegas that's not bad - and I'd had amazing non-European cuisine two nights in a row and wanted something different.  The veggie burger is fine.  It comes with crisps (homemade potato chips - ask for half and half fries/crisps if you like) and is a patty with salad mix, feta cheese, tomato and two rings of pineapple, which I'd somehow missed on the menu.  The feta's not largely in evidence, though the sandwich sheds little crumbs of it, and surprisingly, the pineapple worked really well with it.  The crisps are very well made and fresh; the chips/fries, are American-style thin fries served with a dusting of seasoned salt (and I think just a little sugar).  I'm not usually a big French fry fan but I finished them.  The sticky toffee pudding plate comes 1/3 part a big pile of whipped cream; 1/3 part cake (maybe the size of two medium brownies); and a scoop of ice cream (not very flavorful and I suspect bought premade in scoops from Sysco or similar).  The hot toffee sauce was quite nice, but unless you really love whipped cream or are not fussy about ice cream, it might not be worth the $11.  The reason I'm giving the place 4 stars wasn't the food, which was fine, but the lovely patio and the service.  It was about 5pm on a Sunday and the weather was a perfect 75 degrees; the patio was pleasantly warm but in shade, with a nice view of the Orleans and the mountains in the distance.  Just perfect.  The waitress took good care of me, moving me to the patio when I wanted someplace with enough light to read (the inside is very dim); helped get my bags situated; and was just generally hospitable and delightful.",

The date potential didn't escape me and, tonight our foodie adventure resumed in earnest.    Slap me silly and call me Sally!  The nachos were the best my fat derriere has ever tasted.  The chips are flippin' potato chips.  Done.  Their 'half' nachos (which is half off on happy hour), is enough to feed a boat of refugees. Done - flip me over.    Their selection of burgers are long and their menu features an even longer list of Irish fare.  Let's rewind a bit.  Our go-to place in Chicago was Duke of Perth for AYCE fish and chips.  In ambiance, this surpasses our Chi-town fave.  The food is equally good.  Look out Lent - I'm going to have one major sin and it's gluttony baby.  I'll be back for their Lennmten equivalent on Thursdays.  Shout out to Jessie who was our server!  Great walk through the recommendations.  The Shepard pie is a belt notch looser  Update: yup.  Back again.  Happy hour black mussels are worth updating this review.  The hits keep coming and Cassie our server is over the top awesome.  Another fantastic experience - thank you!",

Our wait at the entryway was quite long, as quite a few busy employees had passed us by but acknowledged our presence.  It didn't seem that crowded but maybe they were short staffed this afternoon.  Once sat, we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Half order of the Irish nachos. The \"Half\" was not what I was expecting when a huge (!) plate of handcut chips covered in cheese, bacon bits, scallions, tomatoes and sour cream. Absolutely delicious!  I had the Shepherd Pie (lunch sized portion) and hubby had the Irish Stew.  My meal was tasty, husband reports his stew was excellent. Although the ambiance was a little too dim for my aging eyes to clearly see the menu, it was nice to be immersed in the Irish culture. The only real complaint we had was the lack of service. Our server didn't check up on us once, my husbands iced tea glass was sitting empty for the majority of his meal, we weren't asked if things were ok and we sat for about 15-20 minutes after our meal was done to get the check. Like I said earlier, maybe they were short staffed today.",

It's a short walk to this respite from the madness!   The minute you walk in you are transported to an atmospheric dark \"Irish family Pub in the countryside\".  It's cool and casual with some usual patrons watching the game and intimate pub seating in all the nooks and crannies. We've come with a large group of rowdies to sit in the back room dining area at happy hour or with family in the more intimate enclosed combination booth tables. Mix with folks or don't. It's your call. The authentic folk music and lively buzz is great!  Staff can be sparse, but very effective.  We'll cut them some slack for the bare bones. They are all solid hard working efficient folks. On to the food...  It's all superb! From the wonderful Irish stew with soda bread or Shepherd's pie to the daily Happy Hour (HUGE!) selections of Irish nachos and fish & chips to the sticky toffee pudding dessert--Wow! Prices are reasonable enough and HH can't be beat!   This establishment is a wonderful respite from the harsh dry blazing desert heat and the faux glitzy smoky casino environment. If you're in the area check it out.  Thank me later!",

I was on the lookout for a different Irish place (we usually go to 9 Fine Irishmen in NyNy). The food in this place was amazing. We started out with a \"5 beer sampler\" for $5. It had Guiness, Harp, Smithwicks and 2 others. So cute. Each one was a decent size, def enough to taste. Then we ordered Irish Nachos. Omg. Homemade potato chips stacked high and covered in cheese, chives, bacon, sour cream, etc. So, sooo good. (get the mini size). We got the half size and def couldnt finish it since we got a whole meal each besides that. Portions are huge here. Next we got a fish and chips appetizer. The fish was cooked perfectly and the fries were great. As an entree, I got my Irish staple- Lamb stew. The most flavorful one I have ever had. Def enough garlic, wine, veggies and spices to make it sing. My bf had the Shepards pie which was perfection. Just enough wine in the ground beef and nice, fluffy potatoes. SO good. For dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding, which is a real gooey brownie.  It was heaven.  Loved this place. Cant wait to return. (see pics!)",

I am usually there 2 nights a week.  It's a great local bar, with wonderful service and off the strip prices.  The place is divided into two areas a gaming/smoking side and the restaurant side.  On the restaurant side there are no gaming machines, so you can sit at the bar even if you're not a video poker devotee, there's no smoking and live music on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.    The food is quite good with pub favorites, inventive seasonal specials and interesting daily specials.  They have a nice beer selection and can turn out wonderful cocktails as well.  The good food, affordable prices, wonderful staff and friendly atmosphere make this a great place to hang out.",

Best of all, the prices were soooo reasonable.  Our budget was tiny but we were able to have a full dinner including an open bar for our guests!  Brian, the owner, stopped in to make sure that our party was going well and that everything was to our liking.  I picked McMullan's off Yelp and I'm sooo glad we did.  They went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect, including creating a makeshift cake stand for my wedding cake.  We had the irish sausage rolls which were phenomenal, as well as stuffed mushrooms, chicken pot pie and the fish and chips.  HIGHLY recommend the fish and chips.  My only complaint was that the main entrees weren't served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out.  That could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so much.  All in all though, I highly highly highly recommend McMullan's.",

However, once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.  It is very charming and almost makes me want to purchase a pint right there.  I do my best to stop the urge.  The seating is odd; we are taken off to another room that I must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.  As the band was showing up right as we were leaving, I could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.  I wasn't that hungry to begin with but one look down the menu had me ordering Beef Stew w/ Guiness.  I was thinking soup more than stew for some reason so when a huge bowl was served to me, I was taken aback.  Had I been hungrier, I would've eaten much more, but instead my companion was asking me if I was gonna eat that.  That was a first!  I didn't partake in the alcohol consumption here (saved my money for Casino Royale) but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.  The cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.    I'll be coming back, hopefully sooner than later.",

    "text": "I've had variations of Irish food in the past but never authentic Irish. A take home with instructions on how to cook corned beef here, a sandwich loaded with corned beef there, and once a Sheppard's pie from a place that specialized in another ethnic variety.  If McMullan is a window on how good Irish food can be then open it up cause i'm gonna jump through it next chance i get.  The Apps!!! Homemade Crisps - I had an impression of what they were going to be like as i read the description and envisioned it in my mind. When they came i was sadly disappointed that the Crisps werent made to order, instead of warm salted crisps they were room temperature. Oh well the taste of them totally made up for the fact that they're made in batches and allowed to sit, which in the long run is better for no oil is still on the crisps. I personally enjoyed both sauces. I had a person preference to never eat or try curry from anyone that isnt of asian or south east asian/indian decent due to a bad experience with a \"Country Captain Chicken MRE\" but damn the curry is right on. A lot of friends werent too fond of the Marie Rose sauce, imagine a sweeter thousand island. To me it's a nice contrast from the curry that tastes pretty darn good when dipped lightly.  Sausage Rolls - Thanks to the internets i've made a few friends in Australia and the UK. I've been to Australia once and was amazed at things like Turkish or Lebanese style Kebabs. My Brit and Aussie mates keep urging me to try Sausage Rolls. No matter who it is or if i just engage a conversation about food with a random Brit or Aussie Sausage Rolls always pop up.  And now the Sausage Roll! Pretty much a sausage rolled in puff pastry served with a very robust mustard. Wasnt too impressed because the sausage tasted VERY close to Vienna Sausages but the puff pastry and the robust mustard made it all go along.  The Entrees!!  Aon Do Tri - A sampler of their main entrees the Aon Do Tri features Diddy's Irish Stew, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and Shepard's Pie. Flanking the three sampler sized bowls are two slices of home made Brown Bread. - To me the Brown Bread is something unique. When i picked it up it had the weight and feel of a thick slice of pound cake, the texture is very similar to cake with the softness and the moisture, but the taste is all bread. A little butter and dip this into the Diddy stew....oh lawd... - Diddy's Irish Stew, Dont order this if you dont like lamb. The first bite was gamey and rustic but comforting. I love lamb and this stew just hit the spot with chunky bits of that adorably delicious mammal, potatoes, carrots, a few slices of onions and large celery cuts that just absorbed all the flavors of the stew. Lamb flavored celery...that's gonna make me drool for a while. - Corned Beef and Cabbage. If i could pinpoint a fault to this it's that the portion size was just too small. Nice meaty hunks of corned beef still in it's cooking liquids swimming with potatoes and cabbage. It just dont get any better then this really. -Shepard's Pie. I would count this as the odd man out in this triumvirate of Irish signature dishes because of the taste. Maybe it's because i saved it for last, maybe because the mashed potatoes trapped the heat inside and the first bite scorched a few parts of the inside of my mouth. Flavor wise i was just expecting a bit more from this.  - Fish n Chips WOW, large cuts of flaky cod, very light but crisp breading and what seemed to be a home made tartar sauce with lots of relish flavor. I might just have to start spending Thursday nights here...  - Beef & Guinness Stew Andy ordered this and i grab a small spoonful when he wasnt looking. Now this is some goooooood stew! You can barely taste the Guinness but cant help to notice the richness of it in the stew. The beef was tender cooked to perfection and absorbed a lot of flavor. Very nice indeed.  The Desserts!!! PPS: There are traces of nuts in these desserts I lol'ed at this comment. Check the menu it's there. Check the online menu it's there too.",

This may be a plain old bar to the locals, but it will always be perfect in my eyes: open 24 hours, serving better-than-average pub grub, cider on tap, low-key welcoming bartender, and a 5 minute drive/cab ride from our hotel on the strip. I may just book my hotel for the next day and come here directly from the airport next time I'm in town.",

That would be like saying that the Venetian makes you feel just like you are floating down a canal in Italy or that the New York New York is The Big Apple of your eye. Hell, if this were True we could all just flock to Vegas and come home saying we traveled the world...and save a lot on airfare in the process. No, this is not a possibility.   What you get in Vegas are suggestions and small glimpses of places that actually exist, done up in bright lights with a dash of tacky and a facade of what the real thing might slightly resemble.   The farther away from the strip that you get, the less inherent these qualities are, so, since it is a bit out of the way, McMullan's is not a bad rendition of an Irish Pub. They pour a good Guinness, are one of the few places that carries Magners in Vegas, and many of their menu items are traditional pub fare. They, however, seem to be, like many establishments in Vegas, trying too hard and overdoing it a bit.   Nice switch from the glitter and glam of the strip, priced more local friendly, and a variety of bands most every night of the week. Not a bad place, but if you want a True Irish pub Ireland would be a good place to look.",

    "text": "As an Irish person living in Vegas, it saddened me to see no \"Irish\" pubs in Vegas when i moved here and then in the space of 3 years we had 5 and now there are 10 so called Irish pubs.  All i can say is that in my opinion there are only 3 Irish pubs worth visiting in Vegas where you :  a) don't get ripped off b) get good service c) get good food d) get a good pint of plain.  Mc Mullans is one of these establishments.  The staff are very friendly and the food is great.. (Irish nachos.. mmmmm). The Pint is great and  so is the price.  Live music during the week is great as well.  Soccer and Rugby is shown here as well in the area in the back which is great when you get a crowd.  (it has its own bar so no need to go far to get a pint during that nail biting game)  The biggest thing though that makes an Irish Pub is not the decor nor the selection of drink nor food. It is simply the staff and owners.  In this day and age where more LLCs and Corps own bars its a refreshing change to see Lynn and Brian (the owners) serving food or walking around greeting customers.  I have NOT come across that anywhere else in Vegas.  So if your after a great Irish pub, Give theses guys a shout.  Oh !!!! don't get confused with the Irish bar in the Orleans hotel and casino, (which is crap) Mc Mullans is beside the Orleans Hotel.",

    "text": "The decor is really great.  There are quite a few different places to sit: they have a bar, tables with stools, a few booths that have really private alcoves, and then different seating areas with bench type seats and regular chairs for groups.  There is also some outdoor seating, and they are prepared for the winter chills with upright heaters.  They have live music pretty regularly.  There is... or was, not sure, a one-man band called Finnegan's Wake.  The last band I saw did some pretty cool Van Morrison and Flogging Molly covers.  I know it's blasphemy not to drink at Irish pub, but I don't drink at all, so I can't really rate the drinks.  I've heard from friends that the Guinness on tap is good, and that the Irish Coffee was ok.  They have these \"Bit o' Beers\" which run about $5 and have a sampler of... I think it was 5 beers.  There are 3 kinds, but the beers listed are all you can get, as in you can't substitute anything.  They have similar offerings for whiskey, and there is always a beer on special for a $4 pint.  I like to start with the chips.  They are homemade, and come with two different sauces.  The rosemary is my favorite, but the curry isn't bad, either.  They have Irish nachos, but it's basically just nachos with potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  Ground beef, cheese and potato are Irish staples which could be had in better ways.  In the winter, my favorite dish is the Beef and Guinness Stew.  Unfortunately, it is seasonal, so it's not currently being offered.  It's a saucy stew, obviously, and has tender vegetables, and of course, of course, potato.  If you aren't sure of what to get, they have a dinner entree called \"Aon, Do, Tri,\" which, if you say it out loud, is \"One, Two, Three,\" with an Irish accent.  That is a sampler with Corned Beef and Cabbage, Diddy's Irish Stew, and Shepherd's Pie.  Quite good with the exception of the Irish Stew, which I found to be a bit bland.    I enjoy the fish and chips (make sure you ask for the Heinz Malt Vinegar on the side.\"  Crispy fish and crispy french fries.  I've been meaning to try the Reuben, but it comes with an onion relish or something like that, and you know how I feel about onions.  My friend had a slice of chocolate cake for dessert on her birthday, and that was rich, decadent, and delicious.    The reason it doesn't get a 5/5 is because of the service.  The servers are nice and orders come out correctly, but sometimes it can be insanely slow.  I've been on nights where it wasn't so crowded, and I've been on nights where, walking through the crowd, I couldn't tell if it was really that packed or I was getting groped.  Although it doesn't happen every time, there are occasions, regardless of crowd, where a meal has taken an insanely long time.  I don't mind because I go with friends and we have no problems chit chatting, but if I was in a hurry, or less easy going, it'd be frustrating.  My last experience, I made a reservation at least a week prior for 7:00 for a birthday party, and came to find out when we arrived one of our tables had been given away.  We didn't actually get seated until 8:00 (they put us outside to sit and wait where it was pretty hot.  Who I assume is the owner came out and apologized, but nothing was really done to compensate), the appetizers we ordered didn't get there until almost 9:00, and the food took forever to come out once it was ordered.  I will assume it's because it was packed and a Friday night, but jeez, the wait was really something else.  I will continue to go here when the Irish food craving bites me, but I'll make sure not to go on a Friday night.  I shudder to think about the wait times on St. Patty's Day.",

The waitress had the authentic Irish accent which was pretty cool   We ordered Irish pie with steak and mushroom, Irish pie with chicken curry, Irish sausage roll, bangers & mash, and of course fish and chips.  They all tasted very good to me.  The crust of the pie and sausage roll was amazing.  The curry chicken was surprisingly good.

    "text": "This is my four day review of McMullan's Irish Pub. Just to qualify, I flew from Orlando Florida to Las Vegas just to spend four days in this specific Irish Pub. I may be a bit biased.  The pub has three distinct sections. At one end is a bar with video poker machines. These are the multi-denominational multi game machines so you have choices. The bar also has a lot of promotions such as a free spin for prizes for every four of a kind you hit. Smoking is permitted in this room - picture old vegas and you get the picture. The middle section is more like a traditional Irish Pub - no gaming and lots of private seating for meals. Of course the Guinness is a proper poor - no sense reviewing an Irish pub that can't do that. The back is another bar that is mostly for private events and the like. It's got a full bar and plenty of room for a decent get together.  The Shepherd's Pie is wonderful as is the Farmhouse Irish Breakfast. (Before you ask - white and black pudding is sausage) The service is great and personable 24 hours a day.  We got in at 1:30am Christmas Morning and headed to McMullan's right after checking into the hotel. A night cap of a couple of Guinness while we watched the marathon of A Christmas Story on TV. After catching a few winks we were back again for Christmas breakfast of a few more Guinness and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - wonderful.  We repeated this similar pattern until the 27th when we came back for a private party. The service for our party was fantastic! My wife made all of the arrangements and said that Brian McMullan was wonderful to work with.  All in All I'm pretty stingy with my five star reviews. This place is definately worth every star.",

It may not be fancy, but it is firm (nothing worse than a mushy veggie burger), and it manages to have a nice grilled flavor so often missing in a meatless number. For those keeping count, it is $9. To make it even better, Mr. McMullan knows how to serve up a burger - with leafy green lettuce, a heaping of pickles and grilled onions! Love it! Also of note is the cole slaw. If you like it sweet, this is a gem of cabbage. I cleaned my plate and was a little sad to see it all go. Plus, they have free Wi-Fi, which makes my iPhone very happy.",

Maybe I was high from winning $50 on bingo earlier that night (HUGE winnings from someone who usually gambles about $1 per Vegas trip, on penny slots no less), but I was really taken with this little gem of a place. It's such a well-hidden secret that I'm guessing the only the locals go here, but once you step inside, you will be transported to the Emerald Isle. The pub is run by an Irish gent, and hey, my waitress was Irish too, so there are some authenticity points.   I played a show on this particular evening and the crowd was enthusiastic, polite, and focused on the music. (I guess my expectations were that of playing to a bunch of rowdy footballers (so maybe the pub is not THAT authentic). I sold some cds, met some new fans, and sat back to watch the headlining band Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Things got particularly raunchy when they covered \"Baby It's Cold Outside\". I mean, hey, they also play a song called \"Got So Drunk I Crapped Myself\" and have an album called \"Christmas Songs for drunken Athiests\" , so you kind of know what you're in for. Darby O'Gill is the house band...make sure you get there on a Wednesday night to check them out.  What to order: Guiness, a Veggie Burger, and Mashed Potatoes (w/ a sprig of Rosemary).",

We looked through the menu that had a multitude of options to choose from, a good selection of beers, plus decent wine list. I decided on the Three Cheese Burger Wrap, which is on a whole wheat with mozzarella provolone, and mixed cheese and my boyfriend got the Sheppard's pie.  Everything was delicious,  cooked well, and seasoned thoroughly. I really like this place and will have to come back and try everything else.",

    "text": "I can now update my review for McMullan's because we came here for dinner last night before going to a show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre.  While I am not knowledgeable about Irish pubs, McMullan's earns all 5 stars--it was as good as it gets!  I asked our server, Jessica, if we could sit out of the bar area in the small room that is to the right after you enter.  Once our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, it turned out to be the right choice.  It's a delightful room and just a bit away from the music and the talking in the bar area.  I had studied the menu online before we went, and I knew what I was getting, the Irish chicken curry pie.  Andrea surprised me by wanting the steak and mushroom pie so it was Irish pies for both of us.  We knew in advance that it would be at least a 25 minute wait and we just chatted and I took some photos and explained what was behind the door to the Shenanigans room.  Our pies were brought to us and they were delicious.  I loved the curry taste of my chicken and there was some zing to the curry.  It was much different than the flavors of Indian or Thai curry.  The pastry was very flaky and stayed that way all the time I was eating.  Andrea enjoyed her pie, too.  With both dinners came a large amount of mashed potatoes and a good serving of peas.  All the time, our iced teas were refilled and Jessica checked back often to see how we were doing.   Of course, a dinner out is not complete without the sweet so we ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and shared it.  We got it with vanilla ice cream which was put in a separate glass goblet so the heated pudding didn't melt the ice cream.  A winning dish!  During our time here, Mr. McMullan came to the table twice.  He remembered me from the shows I was there to see and he wanted to say hello.  Later he checked to make sure everything was OK with our dinner.  The personal touch of Mr. McMullan, the delightfully friendly server Jessica, and the outstanding food all made the evening a 5 star experience.  And what could be better than this--seeing two Yelp friends and somewhat neighbors, who were there having dinner too!  Hey Candace. and August.  Good to see you again!  We will be coming back to try more of the things on their extensive menu!",

Half off appetizers and $1 off well drinks/ pints of beer. Not bad at all.   Started with the Bits O' Beer #2, which consisted of Carlsberg, Stella Artois, Glenance Hefeweizen, Blue Moon and Blackthorn Cider, which was $5. I'm a sucker for a good hef, so I opted for this one. The last three beers were my faves. We ordered the appetizer fish and chips, which was big enough to share. It was good, what fish and chips are supposed to taste like. Also got the steamed mussels, served with a tomato broth. I've had better mussels at Herbs & Rye, so this dish was just eh. Good thing it was half off.  The best part of the night was our entertainment. Older Irish gentlemen playing the guitar and harmonica singing songs requested by the audience. Nothing hip, so don't expect any Jay-Z or anything. He also had a lot of witty sayings like \"May the good Lord take a liking to you, but not too soon.\" Made fun of the other drinking patrons which was funny. Good drinks, good food, good company, good entertainment.",

Honestly I'm not big on sausage - it's not one of my favorites - but this place just makes it work.  We ordered the Irish Sausage Rolls for $9 as an appetizer and the portion was the perfect size for two people. I'm not sure what exactly is in this dish but I'm not complaining. Sausage in a \"puff pastry\" and they weren't joking - the pastry that this is wrapped has the perfect amount of fluff and flakiness to it. It comes with Irish stone ground mustard that I would eat with ANY meal. This dish was so easy to get addicted to.  As my entree I got the Aztec burger (8oz ground top sirloin, jalapenos, jack pepper cheese, lettuce, tomato, sliced dill pickles, raw red onions & 1000 island dressing served on a bun - $11). The burger itself was amazing and I would order it again and again but when it comes time to eat it, it's so big that it fell apart within minutes of taking the first bite. I guess that's a good burger though right? The ingredients blended perfectly; it was one of the few times that I didn't feel the need to add spice to my meal. This place is great and the waitress that served us was very nice and patient in explaining the menu to us.  Also - one last thing - the inside is usually packed and STUPID loud so I recommend sitting on the patio if it's not too hot outside (we went at 9:30 p.m.), OH! And there's a Summer drink/food menu  :)",

Their food is average but on par with the rest of the city when it comes to this type of fare.    The 3.5 stars mainly come from two things: beer deals and trivia.  They have a few deals during the week that bring the price down a few dollars to make the price very affordable compared to other establishments in the area.  Next, their trivia is one of the better ones in the city.  The bar gets packed and it is very competitive.  The questions are not unreasonably hard (other than the music round) but good luck winning unless you're a pro.  There are upwards of 20 teams a week and usually some trivia experts who win every week.    McMullin's is still fun to come out and play trivia and drink some beer, but the restaurant itself is not a must try on its own.",

    "text": "I guess I could be considered a regular, I live near by, and this is my go-to place. After visiting the UK and Ireland, I know what to expect from a True Pub. It is Not fine dining. There is Not always a host/hostess waiting for you at the front door.  Just walk in, and order from the bar. A server will cruise by, just ask for a table. I find it perfect after work, or on a Sunday early evening. The live music is designed to help you shake off the outside world; Sing and clap along, no one bites! The servers are all great, each with their own attitude and sense of humor. We like Jen at a table, and Zack at the bar. Look around and you usually see Brian McMullan,(the owner) he is very easy to talk to. The Chicken Florentine is sinful, and the Curry is really authentic. BF usually gets the Sunday Roast, (served just like Mom cooked it). Really, it's the best Irish Pub in all of Las Vegas!",

The bartenders and entire staff seem very nice and friendly- prompt service at table seating. Some of them can be \"cheeky\" but that's what makes it fun! Atmosphere is very authentic... Intimate lighting as well as live music on weekends. I most definitely recommend this place!!!",

There's an outside patio to get some fresh air out of the noise. The staff is fun, the crowd is diverse and a blast. There are usually bands playing on the weekends, it gets loud with everyone singing along, so don't expect to hold a meaningful conversation with someone. They have a fine selection of beer and whiskey at great prices. I've eaten a few things from their menu but the thing we keep going back to is the Irish Nachos, crispy, fresh potato chips covered with tons of melted gooey cheese, bacon, green onions, tomatoes, and sour cream. The half order is huge, more than enough for the 2 of us. You can't help but have a good time here, whether your stopping in for a quick drink or planning on parking yourself bar side for the night. \"Thirst is a shameless disease so here's to a shameful cure.\"",

Was happy to have it on but could have done without being relegated to the smoking area, but it is a bar ... so I sucked up.  We both ordered food - good, good stuff.  I had a blackened burger with chips and we ordered some of that onion gravy on the side - also good stuff.  I forget what he had but he liked it.  I tried whiskey for the first time - forget what it was called but it was Jamisons and ginger ale ... a Ginger Something or other.  May be my new favorite drink.

Also, never got a chance to order a second drink because even though she was around she just never stopped by our table and I couldn't get her attention. In visits past service has been mediocre.",

We were there as usual, sucking at Pub Trivia, and generally ordering fabulous food and drink. One of the couples, who I now officially deem \"Trevorlyn,\" ordered the Caramel Apple Pie. Trust me, this pie is so friggin' good I was excited for them. But when the food came out, it was all delish... but Trevorlyn instead was greeted by some sad, misshapen lump of apple-looking crap.  Sad day. :(  When the waitress, a sassy redheaded Irish lass, checked on us, Trevorlyn said, \"This doesn't look normal...\" The waitress assured us that that was the way it was supposed to be, but you could tell she didn't even buy it. Well, sucks for us. McMullan's is losing a sta--  Wait, what's this?? It's the Lass and I guess one of the manager with another big, real size, omgamazing-looking piece of Caramel Apple Pie, on the house! Apparently they were training someone in the back, and as suspected, it was too small and shouldn't have been sent out.  Good to see that McMullan's recognizes its mistakes and corrects them.

Atmosphere is very nice, old school Irish pub. 7 year old had kids Mac and cheese.  Lots and pretty good. Not orange cheese,  multiple white cheeses.  9 year old had kids burger and fries. Good, large portion. I would go back.",

    "text": "Before I even start my review - I have to say that when I go to an Irish pub I do not get the cred I deserve.  I am half Irish Damn it!  I may not look it - but it's True...   So, I go here with a friend and she tells me that a lot of \"industry\" people go there.  Basically, she was saying it should be a lively crowd.  When I hear \"industry \" people I am think hot ladies!  ... hey, a boy can dream ... right?  It was a friday and they had a band there doing mostly songs from the eighties so I was cool with that.  It was a pretty good crowd.  The bar is split into a smoking section and non - smoking section.    I like it in there.  It obviously is not an authentic Irish pub being that we are in Las Vegas, but I think it has a nice appeal without trying to hard.  This is a cool place to hang out and chill with a few friends or have a big group and get a little rowdy.    We had an order of Irish nachos.  I am from Idaho - we call them \"Idaho Nachos\" up there... but it's cool.  They were actually really good.  The potato chips were good enough just to eat on their own,  The half order is huge!  I am not into Guiness or black and tans  - so I had a few Newcastles.    All in all - I really like this place.  Good place for locals and tourists.",

We had a variety of food; nachos, scotch eggs, fish & chips, pear salad, potato soup, hamburgers, breakfast plate, bangers & mash, corn beef sandwich, etc. Everyone was pleased.   My fish was very greasy and the fries & slaw were not the best. I did not hear any other complaints.  The service was excellent! We had a semi private room which made it nice for our group. I will come back. Can't wait to try some other dishes.",

I am a Guinness girl but I opted for the Kilkenny.  Creamy coffee and caramel flavors, this is great with the hot weather.  We shared the fish and chips.  The batter on the halibut was crunchy and delicious.  The tartar sauce was vinegary in a very good way. Our server was awesome.  How could you not love a beautiful red head with a lilting Irish accent,  We were full so we took the Sticky Toffee pudding to go.  It was delicious...caramel heaven served with whipped cream and dark chocolate sauce.  We had to skip the ice cream.  We will definitely leave room at our next visit.",

    "text": "I absolutely love going here for trivia night, and would a lot more often if my two most solid teammates hadn't moved away. Sob! But they were back for a visit, so off we went, with a few more characters of questionable worth in tow (they were relatives- what can you do)? Turned out great. We had a large enough party to sit in a private room, and with a small crowd, you can order ALL the appetizers and not look fat! (OK, maybe that part didn't work).   We got there a couple of hours early so we could take our time eating and drinking, and it worked out fine. Waitress seemed a little moody at first, but cheered up as the evening wore on (didn't we all?) ,so we have no complaints about the service. The food is good, but bear in mind that, being Irish and all, the cuisine is very heavily potato-based. I have no quarrel with that, but food that heavy does sit a little better when the weather is cooler. Might also help not to scarf down quite so much of it, but how can you leave any of those cheese-a-licious Irish nachos on the plate, even when your huge platter of fish and chips is coming and you KNOW you're going to order the sticky toffee pudding? Have another beer - it will be OK.   Tried the curry flavored pot pie- spicy and delicious, and really liked the turkey burger, topped with (YES!) goat cheese. The homemade potato chip side dish was odd- strange pile of light, crisp fried flaky things. Didn't taste bad, but the texture was dry and more like packing material. Of course, if we hadn't eaten potatoes in 10 other incarnations prior to these, they would not have survived, either. Only loser was the wing appetizer. The parmesan flavor were hot, juicy, and crispy, but a few seconds after the initial bite, you were hit with such an overpowering jolt of salt and sour that each and every mouth puckered into a very convincing sphincter facsimile.   The Trivia was fun and well-run, as usual, and even the scrubs came through, pulling some correct answers out of god-knows-where! (Ex: during the song identification segment, they played the first few bars of a lot of 60's songs. My 23 year old daughter laughed that they all sounded like \"Lollipop\" to her. So, on the one we had no clue about, we guessed Lollipop, and OMG it was right)! Proves that it's helpful to bring a variety of folks. You never know what they're going to ask.We finished respectably, probably could have done a little better if we quit fighting over the answers and the last of the whipped cream! Not to mention our star player took the opportunity to hibernate through most of it. Oh well- next time!",

If you haven't been to pub quiz...it's alot, and I mean a lot, of fun! The MC Dallas, is a hoot.  Team names are offensive and trivia is tough.  5 of us had burgers and 1 had a salad.  Burgers are really good at McMullans.  I like my burger cooked Med Rare and they nailed it.  Nice bloody beef juices oozed onto my plate.  Hearty white cheddar and bacon toppings, and the beef fat flavor just coats your tongue with umami goodness.  Spinach goat cheese salad with candied walnuts with balsamic vinaigrette was light, flavorful and tasty - a little skimpy on the goat cheese.  The walnuts added a crunchy surprise.  We washed it all down with copius amounts of fat tire, guiness, hard cider, and  hef.  And you cannot leave without a sticky toffee pudding.  It's just that - sticky toffee.  It an ultra moist caramely coated cake. yum. yum. yum.",

The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you walk in, it is a full blown Irish style pub in every accent and detail.   We sat down in the bar and ordered the beer of the day.  When my cousin arrived they ordered Irish coffees, which we tried and were delicious!     Food wise, I ordered the lunch size shepherds pie, which was still pretty large and very filling-my cousin's husband got the full size and couldn't finish!  My wife got the small size of the Irish nachos with corned beef which was a massive mountain of potato chips cheese, corned beef and other deliciousness.   This place is easily one of my favorite Irish pubs I have been to.    Service was great and at the end my cousin let it out that it was my wife's birthday, so the server brought this delicious and ridiculously dense chocolate cake out for her, on the house.  We all took a couple bites but had to throw in the towel before it was finished.  Definitely and awesome place!",

Now, you'd think that that would be easy in Las Vegas, but overpriced casino food or buffets don't cut it when all you want is some good home cooking or a place to decompress.  This is the best, most authentic pub that I know of in the city.  Their live music is great and they have the gaming section in another part of the place, so it really feels straight out of Dublin.  Having visited there recently, it reminds me of O'Donoghues.  All that is missing is the people yelling at the local football team on the TV and people driving on the other side of the road when you step outside.  As for what to get, the Fish and Chips is spot-on.  The other food is straight out of Ireland, which is a bit of an adjustment to some people, but like an oasis in the sea of fusion food that this city has become if you want real pub grub.  Local tip: The late night happy hour is the best deal in town.  Half price sides and $1 off Pints.",

The food, I got a mini order of the Irish Nachos and they were GIGANTIC. More importantly they weren't skimpy and the chips weren't Tostitos..piled high with condiments on every chip. A Must 2.) Friendly staff, how many of us have been to an establishment where the food is dynamite but the vibe form the staff isn't there ? Had great conversations with both of our bartenders who answered all of our touristy questions while keeping our drinks full and cold. 3.) lighting , nobody wants to eat at an Irish restaurant where you feel like your sitting in the sun.  The lighting dim and comfortable. A perfect setting for a night out with family , drinking friends, or a first or tenth date . Hats off to McMullan's will be back next time in beautiful Las Vegas .",

If you need to change to order due to food allergies like I have to, you get a blank stare and charged for the \" extra\" and there isn't anything in writing that says \" no substitutions\". They also double charged our credit card and when my boyfriend and I went back to fix it, the so-called management told us to let our bank handle it because that happened ( double charging ) there are the time, so is he saying that his employees or place of employment are thieves? Hmmm, makes you wonder. Then on busy nights, they don't have a hostess once again saying that it'll be a long wait, nor a sign on their door saying that they have reached their capacity and the staff doesn't know what to do anyway except one server, the rest are rude and just don't care. Will I recommend this dump of a Pub? No! I lived in Europe and stayed in the UK and the pubs there would laugh and shake their heads at this one. Also, I just loved being led to a supposedly reserved table which me and my guest were not told was reserved, because we didn't make reservations and it's beyond filthy and no \" reserved\" sign on the table, so these nitwits should have cleaned the table and sat us, instead we ate somewhere else, a far more pleasant place, that knew what they were doing.",

The shrimp cocktails were pretty good, not big but also not small to the point of being upset and asking where the hell is the shrimp.  I would  say average size.. a little smaller than a bic full size lighter if that helps.  Bits of fish were also delicious, breaded evenly with a nice crunch and a tender center (yet firm) with that ohhh soo yummy fishyness.  Take note that they offer  two sauces  which are the Vinegar for the fish (typical) and a louisiana sauce which tastes like a kicked up tobasco sauce.  We put that louisiana sauce on EVERYTHING..  it was that good.  Now the Irish nachos are something that legends are made of.  This 1/2 order was ginormous!  I do however recommend if you order it.  You must eat it while it's still hot.  We ordered so much food that we got to eat and it was cold.  Still friggin delicious but difficult to eat because all the REAL cheese wasn't melted anymore.  I can't wait to come back here and try some more of their food!   Last but not least.. Their drinks were definitely on point !  Fresh tasting with a huge kick in the baby maker..  they don't mess around!  A+++",

    "text": "Thanks to Pokemon Go, I've found a hidden gem near me. I've always gone for happy hour and the deals are great, 1/2 off appetizers and $1 off drafts I think. They also have a beer flight for $5.   Hands down the best lemon pepper wings I've EVER had. Granted, I've only had wings at a few places including Buffalo Wild Wings & wingstop but the wings here come out super hot, crispy on the outside and very well seasoned. Plus, you get 12 wings for about $6-7 during happy hour. But make sure you count your wings because the last two times we went they were 1 or 2 wings short. We didn't catch it the first time until we almost finished the entire plate but notified the server the second time the same thing happened. The server apologized and brought out our missing wings.   Irish nachos were ok, we ordered the half order. Full order is HUGE. The potato chips were again, very hot and came with a bunch of cheese and sour cream. I wasn't a fan of the cheese but enjoyed the chips. However, I probably won't order them again.  Fish and chips were my sisters favorite but I felt that the fries were inconsistent. Depending on who's cooking, they could be overly salty or soggy. Either way, my sister and her BF enjoyed them. One downside is that they don't give you enough tartar sauce!   It's pretty dark in there and the crowd can get kind of loud, but what do you expect? I love looking at all the decorations. Service was great and they have good specials on entrees as well.",

    "text": "This is a pub and restaurant. Emphasis on the pub. (More of that later.)  I went specifically for the fish and chips. It was not Thursday-where they have All You Can Eat Fish and Chips .. But I didn't care. I had a craving and I knew what I wanted , even though they had a steak and shrimp SPECIAL which would have been 11 bucks and the 3 piece Fish and Chips was 16 bucks.   Like many pubs the lighting is dim , I couldn't even read the menu. I knew what I wanted so it didn't matter. (Later my eyes had adjusted from coming in from bright daylight and I could see things better.)  The fish was excellent . Big tender flakey pieces deep fried in a beer batter . Very satisfying and filling. Next time I will opt for the 2 piece. Tiny side of slaw was some of the best I've had. I only wish it was a bigger portion. The heaping pile of fries tasted good to begin but seemed to grow soggy with time. I'm a vinegar man when it comes to fish and chips and happily they had malt vinegar. I also tried the tartar sauce even though I don't do tartar . It was really good. But I stuck with my vinegar.  The wait staff was very efficient and friendly . Jessica was my server and was very helpful and answered other questions I had about happy hour, portions, other menu options etc.  Here's the thing . It's a pub as I mentioned before. People drink here. People get drunk here. When I went there was a large very loud table where at least one of their party got borderline belligerent and entertained his table by telling innapropriate and offensive \"jokes\" the entire time I was there. NOT the fault of the resturaunt I realize .. I only mention it to illustrate what is likely to be part of the atmosphere in any pub-resturaunt ... So not a good place for kids.  I love love love the nice private booths that may be available depending on how crowded it is.   I will DEFINATELY come back here, mostly because it is close to my house. But being entirely honest - the food is good.  Happy hour offers half price appetizers until 6 pm and I was kindly offered happy hour prices even though happy hour had only one minute left when I arrived. Warning : some of the appetizers are meals unto themselves. For example the Irish Nachos are HUGE.  To make this a better dining experience for me - they would have to put candles on the tables or adjust their lighting . I realize there's nothing to be done about the noise level of drunks, and that is part of what you bargain for when you eat at a pub .   P.S ... Some may think 16 bucks is a little steep for fish and chips , but do some price checking at other places . Good resturaunt fish and chips are all gonna be about that price . And these were really good. 2 pieces run around 13 bucks and would be more than filling . They do take reservations here but unless you request a special booth or back room private areas.... You should be fine with just showing up without reservation.",

I'd hoped to find a great local Irish pub that was off strip, with good Irish food (real Irish, not Americana nonsense like leprechaun fries and shamrock burgers and such) and a great selection of Irish whiskey at affordable prices... McMullan's has all that along with great decor and an outstanding bar and wait staff. If you want real Irish, this is the place. I'm not sure what wowed me more, the sticky toffee pudding or the Irish whiskey selection. Both are a win and McMullan's is a 5 star Irish pub for sure.

Both St. Patrick's day events have been great and I plan to go there every St. Patrick's day that I am in Las Vegas. Beyond that day, they have a good kitchen with a pretty large menu of tasty food. Tons of alcohol and beer options. I have never been there on random quiet Wednesday night so I cannot speak to that experience but I can say the place has always been fun and worth going to.

We ended up grabbing one of the large tables in the back room since we were a group of 6 (she had a friend and I brought my Vegas crew).   Drinks are super affordable and if you're there during happy hour, which we were, appetizers are very cheap too. We got their Irish nachos, which are basically hand-cut potato chips in a mountain of cheese and sour cream. It was really, really good, but such a huge portion we couldn't finish between the 4 of us.   They also have live music (we were there on a Friday night at about 10:30pm), which was nice. It's a bit far from the Strip, but that just means it's less touristy!",

The Guinness is pretty much always poured properly which is great for me since I work at the Guinness Store and love a properly poured pint. The food is always fantastic. Those nachos man. They really have my heart! It's just always the best time there thanks to the team working there and the food.",

Batter was light and not greasy. Fries on point. The Texas BBQ Burger was a very tasty char burger. Easy to get to, cool bar scene, music some nights. I'd go back!",

First off, prices are pretty cheap compared to other places. The staff is charismatic and extremely easy to talk to. Jason happens to be my favorite. When it comes to the food, I haven't had anything other than, the Irish nachos, and their wings. I will defiantly try the other food but, You MUST try the Irish nachos, especially with chicken (blacken). I love the atmosphere as well. Dim, relaxed, very tranquil to say the least. They also have live music! I want to say every weekend. Defiantly my regular bar and will forever be my St. Patrick's day bar. If you're in the area and in the mood for a drink. McMullans is where you should stop.",

I've been to Ireland before  so I was excited to see if the food was made the same. Breakfast stops at 11 am here so we hauled tail to make sure we got there on time. Walked in at about 10:48 am and what do I see....Nobody. Not a single soul or staff member was there to greet and seat us. Now I know mornings are usually slow so staff can be light and that's fine with me, but I waited and waited and waited some more but in the end, nobody came. I must have waited for 10-15 min and nobody came so I left. I was excited to get me some good Irish food too but unfortunately left disappointed. One star for the lack of customer service but I call it like I see it so they get an extra star just because the decor was just like in Dublin.",

There's so much to comment on but I will just include the things that truly made me fall in love with McMullan's.  - $2 chips and gravy during happy hour(regularly $4). The gravy was so good you could drink it right from the bowl. And after several Smithwick's I did just that to prove it. - Buy one get one free drinks when you show them a Las Vegas Wrangler's ticket stub from that night. - Amazing beers on tap including the aforementioned Smithwick's, Guinness, Harp, Boddingtons, and a selection of deliciously tart ciders. - They know how to correctly pour a Guinness! - The live bands are ALWAYS entertaining and many times very funny! - There is a special closed off sidebar for smokers so you can actually go to this bar for a few hours and come home without your clothes smelling all nasty",

    "text": "Friday arrived and we have wanted to try this pub. I myself was born into an Irish American clan so when someone says \"Irish food\" I know I can at least rely on some beer for flavor and interest. What they say about Irish food is True. Dull. We sat out on the Cameron Street patio which does have heaters. It was pleasant enough. Our waitress , Susan, was wonderful though everyone noted how overworked and under-helped she was. For some reason I felt as though I was in a dream. Guinness, which I like, was for the first time ever, lifeless and resembled a much lighter substance- water. A second beer of another type had never shaken hands with a single hop.  The home made potato chips were nice. The McMullan's meat pasty had flaky crust. Little flavor to the insides. Chicken curry pie was somewhat flavorful. Mashed potatoes and peas were ok. The stools on which we sat outside were wobbly and felt weak as though you had to remain very still.  For some reason a big a$$ and his loud rowdy attention- seeking wife were just behind us. The man reached over and pulled some hair from the back of my sweater. It was very weird but we were pleasant about this intrusion. Later they tried to engage us in loud conversation unsuccessfully while others on the patio were noting their crass behaviors too. It would have been preferable to sit inside where we could have been bombarded by the live music, pushed in the ribs by the happy drinking crowd, and avoided these two dopes. The three stars are for Susan and the other wait staff who remained very pleasant and helpful despite aching feet and backs from working so hard at this place. I would not return for the food. It was hot when delivered but the next time I want watery beer and something bland to eat I can break apart a shipping box into little bites and dilute my own Guinness. Meh.",

At first it was going great until the server decided to think it was ok to ignore their customers ***4 times in a row might i add*** (and yes I get they get busy BUT when each time I call you when I was only asking for a box you look at me then walk off to a bigger table THAT is a issue!) It took a CUSTOMER to get ANOTHER waitress's attention to get the box. THEN When getting the check again she ignored me but when my boyfriend just raised his hand it was instantly \"Yes Sir, no Sir\". As she brought the check to the table gave it to him  when I had my hand out to get it so I can pay. (Believe it or not some women DO pay the check). I normally do not complain about anything like also about the last time I was there I was to get 10 dollars credited back to my account yet never received, by the same waitress. But when another chick bluntly is sexist thinking the man will be the one to always pay is bull crap. Yeah their food IS amazing but not enough to feel as though I shouldn't be there due to that. Sad thing is I came there with 60 bucks to give to which ever waitress we got and that deserved it, and left with 56 of it in my pocket.",

After 3 hrs we went back up to see where we were the guy was very unprofessional started flipping through book and was like your not on this page 4 more hours. Like wtf? They are an Irish pub. Yes they probably make a lot of money that night. They could have made more if they were setting limits to tables for food. People literally were just chilling at tables after eating for hours. That should have been planned a lot better. People drinking want food. We couldn't get food at all. We tried to order the food to go so we could eat where the music was, but after we asked the waitress to order she didn't come back. We waited 20 mins.

We asked for separate checks, ordered and was over charged for items. She never cleared our table. Only when we got up to get rid of the plates that had been sitting for 30 minutes did the bus person take them away.  When we got the bill. It was one check not split as requested when we sat down.  The server denied we had asked.  More attitude. What troubles me as much is everyone else still wanted to give her a 18% tip.  Why?  For crap service?   We support the establishment by spending our hard earned money.  This server should be fired not getting a $20.00 tip for attitude and crappy service.",

Low lighting, dark wood, great beer, a boisterous group and lots of memorabilia = a Good Irish ambiance.  What's even better is that there is a Smoking side and a Non-Smoking side. :)   We started with the Irish Sausage Rolls... YUM!  These are Irish pigs in a blanket and are yummy, yummy!  These and a pint... coulda eaten them all night long.  The sausage was savory and juicy... the blankets were soft and flaky.  I had the Diddy's Irish Stew and my companions ordered the Chicken Causeway Curry.  All of it was FABULOUS!    My stew was hearty and savory with big chunks of lamb.  The brown bread was perfect for dipping in the stew.  My companions' curry was also very good without being overly-curry-ie.  Theirs was served with Jasmine rice as you might expect a curry might be.  I think the base for the curry was the same as my stew so I think that's why I liked it (as I am not a curry fan).  Service was spot on!  All in All, a GREAT meal that was quick, tasty and filling.  We will definitely be going back to McMullan's before the Wranglers game again.",

    "text": "I love McMullan's. I come here after work, I come here for lunch on my work break, and I've come here on dates. If you ask me to go to a bar, I'm gonna want it to be McMullan's. Love love love.  The servers are all super friendly, and the McMullan family is full of great people. Outside of the bar they've created and the service they provide, they work with a great charity that fights childhood cancers every year called St. Baldrick's. Every year, they host a big event where people get their heads shaved in solidarity with kids battling cancer and they raise a TON of money in partnership (usually) with other Irish pubs in town. They also do other events to help raise money for childhood cancers, but off the top of my head, I couldn't name them.   The drinks are fairly priced, and the food is AWESOME. Seriously, order the nachos. I eat (and drink) there all the time, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. When it's really crowded, it can take a bit to get your drinks or find a server, but it's never been bad enough to irritate me or make me leave - that's what happens in bars.   McMullan's also hosts live music and a trivia night every Tuesday. The trivia night gets really crowded but is pretty fun (and challenging), so I'd suggest going beforehand to eat and get a table as early as possible - at least an hour. The music is usually one particular performer who is dirty and funny and really talented, but I am secretly old and don't like going when he performs on Friday and Saturday nights as you can't hear your friends talking to each other over the music. Outside might be better for chatting when the bands are playing.  Parking can be a little hard to find on crowded nights, but the Home Depot next door-ish always has space. I've only had to park that far on Trivia Tuesday, and maybe after one or two Wranglers games.   Check out McMullan's once and you'll probably end up coming back. How many other bars get you drunk AND give back to children?! Only the best ones.",

The food here is amazing and I love it. The shepherd's pie, Irish nachos, sticky toffee pudding, their bread. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. I enjoy the atmosphere as well. Check it out and enjoy. Maybe hit it on a live music night.",

I highly recommend the Irish stew and fish n chips.  All the potatoes cooked here are fresh, not frozen.  Makes a huge difference!",

The food at McMullans is really really good, I usually opt for the Irish Nachos (homemade potato chips, covered with cheese, bacon, and sour cream) but this time I opted for a full meal.   Every day from 4-7 they have happy hour which includes $1 off draughts and well drinks as well as a small assortment of apps for $2.99, but I wanted to give the winter menu a try. (I know old review from my blog, I'm moving a bunch of them over here}  There were 3 things I was debating between, The Shepard's Pie, Irish Stew, and Meatloaf, I then noticed they had an Irish sampler that included both the pie and the stew plus corned beef and cabbage so I decided to give it a try.  I was wondering how all 3 would be served, as I didn't want them to mix together or anything, and then they brought it out. It came out on a big plate with each entree in a ramaken and looked amazing. I first had the Corn Beef and Cabbage, I am not a huge fan of this usually, but the beef, carrots, and broth were amazing, I'm not a big fan of cooked cabbage, I had a few pieces it was good, but I didn't finish it all. Next up was the Irish Stew, it had huge chunks of potato, carrot, celery, and beef, if a great brown gravy (hands down my favorite of the night), then it was time for the Shepard's pie, I have had better and worse, it wasn't anything to write home about, but then again I could have been spoiled by the stew (it was that good!!!).   The meal was also served with some homebaked brown bread, It was a really heavy rye bread but soaked up the gravy and broth perfectly and was a nice addition to the meal. I washed it all down with a Black Velvet (a draught of half Guinness and half cider). All in all a great meal.",

    "text": "McMullan's probably has one of the best happy hours in town. Great prices on the food, and a rotating drink menu make a perfect late night spot.  Like a couple fellow yelpers mentioned, the HH item to order are the nachos. This plate is massive, even the smallest serving, the mini could easily feed 2-3 people. I remember ordering the full order once and pretty much everybody at the place was starting at the foot-high mound of potato chips and cheese. At around 7 bucks, you can't beat it. If your a wing person, try out the 12 wings, each tossed in a different flavor. Lemon-pepper was my favorite.  The rotating beers on tap are a nice touch. Each night they put a special brew up for 4bux. The place can get really noisy and busy on the weekends. Certain night they have bands come in, and if there is soccer on, the place is packed.",

    "text": "Who goes to an Irish Pub and does not consume any alcohol? Me. I came here twice in one week with my coworkers, but only for lunch. So this review is based only on the ambiance, service and food.  On our first visit we were seated in a very roomy, yet somewhat private booth. Our waiter was great, he kept our waters and iced teas refilled and answered the questions I had about the menu. On our second visit we were seated at a somewhat unstable table and service was a little slower/not quite as friendly...   On to the food. For appetizers, the crab cakes are a winner. They were some of the best crab cakes I have had in Vegas, not too small and they had a nice kick to them.   I also had the steak sandwich which was great, and the excellent shepards pie.  On the walls there were many signs that indicated McMullan's has a happy hour worth checking out, and from reading the card on the table I could see that they have a nice selection of beers and whiskeys. They also advertised a weekly trivia night (Tuesdays) and live bands on weekends.   McMullans is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of pubfood... even if you aren't drinking!!",

Brian McMullan was great to work with leading up to the wedding and let us set up the room with our decorations the day before and store our cake and cupcakes in the refrigerator. We chose  buffet style for our guests and family who devoured the amazing sausage rolls, salad, fish and chips, chicken Florentine, mashed potatoes, and veggies. It was one of the best meals I've had, which is nice to say on my wedding day. The bartender and wait staff were great and very attentive to everyone and even turned the air on for me when I was overheating in my wedding dress. They made the whole evening a success and even though I pushed their limits by having a full seated party of 70, they did everything they could to accommodate my guests. I would highly recommend this restaurant for parties and for everyday meals. It's not just a meal, it's an experience and they sure know how to make you feel welcome! ~ The Murphys",

    "text": "Stopped in last night after work to get some good and was really disappointed. I was exhausted from working a double and just wanted some quick food so I ordered fried food off of the late night happy hour menu. Being a server and having worked in restaurants for over a decade, I know that fried food is the fastest thing when you're in a hurry. I ordered fish and chips, Irish nachos and muscles. After waiting for 45 mins (yes that's right, 45 mins!) our fish and chips came out. The bartender dropped the food off without any explanation of what had happened or apology and simply stated the rest of the food would be out in a minute. Being late night, there were not a lot of people in the place so it clearly wasn't an issue of the kitchen being backed up. Then, 20 mins after the fish and chips were brought out the bartender brought out the muscles. At this point I was sick of waiting for our full order and just told the bartender to cancel the rest of the order. Still, no apology or explanation on his part. Finally, being a server I asked him what had happened with our food to which he said the cook didn't see our order for 10 mins... Which doesn't explain how our fried food that should take no longer than 10 mins to make, 20 mins if busy took over hour to get. Really disappointed that nothing was explained, no apologies and no comps offered.",

Bartender gave us some lame excuse about the beer always being served at 38 degrees because serving it any colder would ruin the taste. Never hear that one before, but pretty sure the Stella I was sipping on was warmer than 38 degrees.  Warm beer is warm beer and we came to an Irish Pub, not an English Pub (who prefer their beer warm). I know it is pretty damned hot in Vegas right now, but if your coolers can't keep up at least be humble enough to admit it!!!  Sorry McMullan's, we will NOT be coming back.",

    "text": "Happy Hour prices and yummy food make this hidden gem an easy 5 star hangout.  Since apps were half off 10pm-1am, I had to try a bunch of different ones!  But I had no idea the portions were so huge!    Fish and Chips were good, nice and tender fish, good tartar sauce, fries were decent.  Tried the chips and gravy...didn't do much for me.  Yes, the fries are good, yes the gravy was good, but the combo isn't crazy awesome for me...just tastes fattening.  Preference thing I guess.    Also tried the wings.. 12 in 3 different sauces one.  Cooked well and seasoned well, although the BBQ was noticeably better in my book.  And the infamous chip nachos...good, but wasn't crazy good to me.  Maybe I have to get drunk first lol.  Portions are retarded on this one.  They also had a cool beer tasting and whiskey tasting...5 shots of beer for $5, and the whiskey list had some good stuff on there, starting around $30.  Why are we missing a star then?  Service is almost nonexistent.  The only \"server\" at 11pm is the bartender.....If he has people in front of him, you will not get much of service.  And it is not entirely his fault...they just don't want to hire a food/drink server around happy hour time, so if they are busy, you will WAIT.  Took a while to get the food order in, but once the order was in, the food came out fast.  But we didn't get checked on the entire time, and it took forever to get the check.  We received no refills, on beer or water.   I was going to order another beer after dinner was done, but by the time he finally came over, I decided to just take the check and go.    I guess the real way to get service here is to go directly to the bar if you need anything.  You would probably get it fairly quickly.  Just don't expect anyone to come asking if you need anything.  Don't treat it like a restaurant, and you will have a good time!  Lastly, I called to confirm it was a family friendly spot.  I was ensured it was, even at 11pm.  The place wasn't smokey and smelly like a bar, so it was comfortable even with the little one.  Just in case anyone was wondering.",

I have driven past McMullan's a million times but never so much as made it in to the parking lot.  Embracing my Irishness and taking in to consideration few know how to drink like the Irish, what better choice than to drown sorrows at an Irish pub!  With that being said, we walked in to McMullans where the Irish theme and culture were richly represented.  Great band, lots of laughter, beers on special and the potato soup was worth the trip all in itself.  If you are looking for a cozy eatery and watering hole and you're in the area, I would highly recommend this establishment. It's a little noisy for a date, perfect if you've been dating for a while and lost the interest in actually hearing what your other half has to say ;)",
