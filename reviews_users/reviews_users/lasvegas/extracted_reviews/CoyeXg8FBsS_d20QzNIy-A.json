I felt like my coffee was watered down . Over all everything is kinda bland tasting. I want to see the meat , I want to see the ingredients better . The sauce is good and it would be nice if it was the sea around the island of super pile !  If I want comfort food in a social locals setting this can be the place . I didn't know if my waitress was giving me space to eat , or didn't care to check on me . I wanted more out of my experience and left feeling a little disappointed. I hope the owner will read this and step up his game which I know he can . Thanks til next time",

The coffee made his eyes roll back...so good!!   We were both excited about the food menu. I ordered the empanada sampler! The presentation was simple and satisfying. The outer casing of each empanadas was light and flaky. The first and subsequent bites of each individual empanada suggested that someone knew exactly how to make our taste buds cry.   If you like el desayuno, gotta check this place out for yourself!",

My husband got a salted caramel latte and it was delish. Waited quite a long time for them to be made.... I ordered the La Paisa which came out fairly quick. Good, quality food. Could've used a little heat..but overall good. My husband got a breakfast croissant. Pretty basic, nothing special. Atmosphere was nice and bright. Modern decor. Service was pretty slow. I think there was only one girl helping most of the place, so that didn't help considering how busy they were. She didn't come around much.  A nice stop in the arts district. Walk off your food afterwards and check out all the vintage shops down the block. :)",

Those tasty little hunks of heaven were devoured with enthusiasm on my recent trip to the Hop Nuts neighbor. I knew they made amazing drinks but that was my first time brunching there. My companion ordered their smoked salmon benny and was pleased as well. They stole the spotlight from their delicious lavender latte and quite possibly the best damn chai latte I've ever had. Kudos to you Makers & Finders! The patio is pet friendly and makes for a great spot to take in the arts district. Free street parking and usually plenty of it even with the current construction going on. I'll be back.",

    "text": "I came here with my friend to play catch up over coffee and lunch. It's right on Main Street downtown. Parking was not metered but did have a 2 hour limit. They do close fairly early, so this is not a night time study spot :(. The patio looked awesome but we opted to sit inside and get out of the summer heat.        We sat down at a little table, in chairs that were a lot more comfortable than they looked. We were greeted about five minutes later and asked if anyone had taken our order. Took a little while, but the server was so nice and knowledgable About the menu that it was difficult to care. We both opted for lavender lattes with almond milk. They didn't ask about sizes, so I'm assuming dine in all run the same ($5.50). We received our lattes promptly but the server disappeared before we could order our food. About five minutes later he reappeared and we were able to order. My friend ordered the veggie bagel and opted for the brussels sprouts prepared vegan with fresh garlic.        The lattes... I Highly recommend this beverage. It's probably one of my new favorite coffee drinks. The lavender isn't over powering or too fragrant, which was my biggest concern. There was a perfect balance with hints of lavender and espresso with a touch of sweetness. It was perfect, just not hot enough for me since I drink slow when I'm talking. The veggie bagel looked great! The veggies looked fresh and colorful. It even came with plantain chips. The brussels sprouts were cooked until tender. Lots of flavor from the citrus lime and the savory garlic. I will definitely be ordering these again.        The check after tax was 27.00. For a sit down coffee house, I didn't think it was too bad. I will definitely be returning in the near future.",

I love cafes where they take the time to make a great cup of java especially if there using the V60 slow drip process.. That's the only way to go when you want a coffee fix.   I ordered the the arepa Benny which is like eggs and Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was unique and the beef was made to perfection. Instead of an English muffin they use arepa which is a flat bread made with maize (corn). It was all perfectly matched..

The main draw was their unique trendy menu with healthy/vegan options & most importantly the Lavender Infused Latte. Wow! Not only did the Lavender Latte surpass my expectations, but everything else we ordered did as well (Veggie Benny, Soyrizo Brussels Sprouts, Mexican Spice Latte). I've had about 4-5 other Lavender Lattes in my U.S. travels & this place makes coffee with absolutely NO hint of bitterness or bad aftertaste. Also, their customer service is top notch. It's totally worth visiting for any- both traveler or local.",

After placing our order for our food we indulged in the Salted Caramel Latte and we ordered the vanilla honey latte. However they brought out the wrong latte for my wife, so instead of the honey latte she got the Mexican latte which was fine after all. We had to wait for about an hour to get the Empanada platter which was tasty however after drinking the coffees and eating the empanadas we canceled the rest of our order which had not yet been prepared. The manager came by and apologized at about the 30 minute mark and then the hour-mark because he said they were breaking in a new cook. This place would be on point if they just get their stuff together in the kitchen and pay a little more attention to detail with the orders. I'll probably give them another try in about a month. But if you're stopping in for a latte, I don't think you'll find a better place and this part of town.",

Being both a coffee fiend and snob, I like to see what the black gold brewing masses are creating out there. Makers and Finders are making some serious java, with what seems like five different styles of coffee brewing going here. It's easy to tell they treat it like a True craft. I ordered an iced coffee and it was delicious. No bitter or burst taste and a very smooth finish. This is a good way to wake up after that mid-afternoon crash.   The venue has a very modern and clean look with a mix of both retro and contemporary wall designs. The dining area has plenty of space for eating and sipping coffee or if you just need to get some work done, belly up to the coffee bar or the large work table provided and feast on all that glorious free WiFi.   The staff here is very nice and let me hang for a bit even after they were closing. I will be back for some food samplings and a chill session on their patio!",

Everything was very delicious. The portion size was probably just perfect but I was left wanting more of that salsa verde.  The place was quite busy with both patrons dining in and ordering takeout.  This place is like a diamond in the rough.",

It was a Japanese-inspired pop up dining experience at midnight that transported us to Tokyo. The mood in the space was set perfectly, the staff did their best to attend to the large crowd, and the offerings were so delicious. We tried everything on the small menu and the eel was our favorite....melted in your mouth with excellent flavor. The whiskey option on the drink menu was smooth, fragrant, and classic. Oh! Almost forgot the DJ...mixed music perfectly and kept the mood smooth and sexy. M&F is evolving as a power house when it comes to special events, mainly due to the team's desire to collaborate and bring great people skilled in certain areas together under the same roof. Love this place, and I hope you will as well!",

Located on Main St. near Charleston Blvd., the boyfriend and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon at 3:40, 20 minutes before they close, unbeknownst to us.  Parking was easy since we got lucky and snagged a spot right in front.  The staff didn't shoo us away, even though they would be closing soon and we were ordering more than just coffee.  The menu offerings include breakfast served all day, bagels, sandwiches, salads, soup, arepas, empanadas, desserts, pastries, plus various teas and coffees, including cold brew.  Since time was not on our side during this visit because we had a 4:30 appointment elsewhere, I just had the Turkey Club and a lavender latte.  The club sandwich was nothing special, but I did like the plantain chips that came with it; I wouldn't pay $9 for this again, though.  I did love my lavender latte with almond milk, however.  It smelled wonderful, of course, and was creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.   Service was excellent and I really like the ambiance.  There is a counter as well as an area for the electronic-toting patrons who want to plug in and do some work on their laptops.  I also spied at least one couch in the corner.  I look forward to more visits to try some of the other coffees and the Latin food items, especially when we're not pressed for time.  *Closed Sundays Open Mon-Sat, 7:00-4:00",

However, as I am a firm believer that service is paramount I had to give three stars. This place is disorganized, expect extended wait times for parties larger than two. Yes, they are busy due to their popularity for great food however this restaurant unfortunately could be  significantly much more efficient and increase the number of customers they can turn around. Their layout and service is disorganized. communication between servers needs improvement, in my case the host mistakenly seated a party ahead of us and offered us seating that later the owner/manager had a problem with. At the end we were given a receipt with one total, when we gave our payment the server decided to added 20% gratuity after the fact presenting us with a revised total they charged before discussing with us. This needs to be stated clearly ahead and should be presented at the time the bill is provided. Otherwise I have no problem with a 20% gratuity automatically applied for parties above the restaurants pre-determined size. I value great service and WILL pay for it. Do not go if you are starving, make sure you expect to wait at least 40 mins for larger parties. Reservations are NOT available. Also, they do have an order to go coffee counter, however they have a policy not to sell you a cup if you plan on sitting for a meal until you are actually seated at a table. A customer focused establishment would want you to be comfortable drinking your pre paid coffee in a to go cup while you wait your 30-40 minutes to be seated.",

    "text": "For my money, this is the way new Vegas food  spots needs to be moving. If there is a micro trend downtown (or in smaller neighborhoods) please let this be it.  My hopes for this new trend that are embodied by Makers and Finders:  1. Great tasting food  prepared well.   2. Food with a cultural touch point that provides a flavorful influence on the dishes.  3. Helpful and attentive waitstaff that know the menu and seem pleased you are there.  4. Responsive management who checks on you when they learn there is possible issue with an order.  5. Delicious beverages.  6. Creative and welcoming decor.  I really like this place. I've found my regular dishes and have only had one \"off\" experience with them. Lots of places serve chilaquiles in town, but this is one of the few spots that ensures the chips are crisp and the salsa is flavorful. I think the salsa (when it's on point) makes the dish for me. There's some dimension to the dish and it's more of a modern interpretation---but the bits that make chilaquiles so comforting are there.   Makers and Finders is lovely. It doesn't feel like an attempt at an LA or San Fran style coffee shop. It feels like downtown Vegas with its eclectic art and complicated coffee all set to a Latin beat. I love eating there and I can't wait to get back.  EDITED TO ADD: I'm noticing less consistent preparation if one of my favorite dishes--the chilaquiles.  Each time I visit they are prepared differently. I love the new menu, but I'm less enthusiastic about this place than I once was. Right now they are a solid 3.5.",

She says \"we're going to Makers and Finders.\" We were promptly greeted and asked if we wanted just coffee or wanted food as well. We said we wanted drinks to go and were provided menus. We placed our order and had a seat in a cool little lounging area while waiting for our drinks.  The atmosphere was hip and had a good \"hang out\" vibe. They had a TV (turned off), and had latin music playing in the background. It seemed like it took it a while to get our drinks. The coffee was pretty good, though. I ordered a regular brewed coffee of Columbian origin. You have to select an \"origin\" when selecting your coffee.   The staff was friendly, but it seemed like they were a little \"disjointed\" behind the counter and a little confused as to who was doing what. I am confident the longer they are open, the more in sync they will become and it will only get better from here.  In addition to coffee drinks, they offer a variety of food. One in our party got a bagel with  a cream cheese type of icing. I was lucky enough to sample it and was impressed. I look forward to checking this place out again and will update the review accordingly.",

With owner, operator, and marketing folks working front of house while a team of three manned a small kitchen in back it was mere moments after crossing the outdoor patio and entering Makers & Finders glass door that I was greeted by a young man named Christian and seated along a wall with full view of the extensive coffee bar the service that followed was fun, informative, and efficient as can be - all questions answered and feedback sought on every item tasted throughout my nearly hour long stay.  Stripped down in decor with Botero posters lining the back walls as a mod-techno infused soundtrack filled the air it was with an clean, full-bodied cold-brew that the afternoon began and browsing free WiFi while a few already-regulars chatted at a table to my left it would not be long before the first of three plates arrived, an arepa with a piping hot bun so crisp that it could barely be cut with the flimsy flatware provided while the flavor of crisp fruit, vibrant tomatoes, and mild cheese tinged in balsamic was anything but meek - a restrained sweetness added to the Italian classic and a perfect option for vegetarians and those looking for something healthy and fresh.  Moving onward to things more sinful it was perhaps good fortune for Makers & Finders that I am not, in fact, a vegetarian as the whimsical \"Elvis Press\" was described on the menu with no mention of bacon and although I was admittedly underwhelmed by the doughy croissant - something the restaurant would be well advised to remedy via quick consult to Chef Ogasawara at Sweets Raku, perhaps - the constituents within were again pleasant, the crisp pork offsetting decidedly sweet flavors as molten hazelnut spread and peanut butter made the composition more fork and knife friendly than the sort of thing eaten by hand.  Still sipping the coffee while debating a caramel or honey infused espresso it was not long before a final plate of Ojaldras arrived and having never tasted this dish, thus with no precedent to judge, all I can say is that the crisply fried strips were excellent beneath a veil of citrus-kissed honey while \"seasonal\" vanilla bean ice cream was icy and inert, another outsourcing job to be considered...in this case a job for the team at Art of Flavors, or perhaps another 'unique' purveyor not yet featured in the Las Vegas market as it is with the focus of the brew.  At this point an imperfect vision tucked amidst the unique antique shops on Main Street there is little doubt that Makers & Finders is apt to grow with experience and time, the team obviously interested in the customer experience while the menu aspires to things far more interesting than the typical soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastries popularized by large chains.  Not yet ready to take on spots like Sambalatte or Grouchy John's but obviously much more convenient to the hip-urban crowd it will be interesting to see how this project develops, the brewery next door another clear sign of the direction downtown continues to progress.",

Was promptly greeted by a nice waiter who took our drink and food orders. Food took a little long to come out, but more time for conversation. I got the cafe con leche, and it was a solid coffee for $5. If you're looking for a good coffee and a nice aesthetically pleasing atmosphere than go enjoy a drink or two here. Also had some empanadas, which were fine for $6. But I would recommend springing a little bit more because the main entree type dishes around me looked amazing. Would definitely return :D",

Despite it's great taste the size you're getting at $6.50 is a little steep, but it's definitely something you should try once.",

    "text": "Worth trying.  We came for the coffee and were a bit disappointed.  But we LOVED the food.  So think of this less as a coffee place and more of a breakfast place that does a great job at doing almost everything right with the food.  First off, the service was good.  We came in on the first day and they were busy and were willing to move things about to get us seated as quickly as possible.  Then, we realized that we weren't gonna get the coffee we wanted, and we had already eaten.  So instead of just sticking it out we let them know we were heading out and would be back the next day for some of the great looking food.  The next morning we were there, and we had a reservation.  We were seated promptly and our drinks were taken.  Now don't get me wrong, the drinks are just fine for a breakfast place.  Standard fair with some nice drink options.  But no craft coffee.  No snob coffee.  But the food was great!  With Vegas having so many places and with us getting into Vegas only rarely.   I doubt we will go back.  But if I lived here.  It probably would be a go to place when I want the unique breakfast fare they offer.  Plus, it was really cool of the waiter to offer to take a picture of us!",

This was not our first time experiencing Makers & Finders. Usually we order from Uber Eats and decided to go out for breakfast.   As expected, for a Saturday morning it was busy, and we were told it was a 20 minute wait. That's where problems started, but not on our end. We saw 2 different people leave because they were seated and no one came to them to offer them water, give them a menu or even great them for almost 10 minutes. It took almost 5 minutes for a server to even realize they were gone.  This same thing happened to us when we sat down. The couple next to us were seated even before we got there 25 minutes before, and they hadn't even ordered.   By the time we got our drinks, we had been there for an hour. Neither us nor the tables around us were given spoons for the sugar on the table and had to resort to forks and knives in replacement.   Jacob got the breakfast sandwich, which he said was cold, and dry. It was flavorless, and for us having been sitting there for an hour and a half, were not too thrilled. I got the salmon Benny, which was missing a vital ingredient, salt. The arepa was extremely dense, chewy and bland. My poached eggs were hard in the center, and the mariquitas were unseasoned. The only thing good was our latte's and the breakfast empanadas.   I would not order the food here again. I would not drive here again, I might Uber Eats a latte, but I'd rather go somewhere else for that effort.   Happy Eating!",

I think most of the great reviews go to the cute and nice environment instead of the food.  I ordered the bon bon latte and chicken tinga omelet with a side of Brussels sprouts. The Bon bon latte (layered latte with condensed milk and coco powder) came in a small cup ($5). It was unique but too sweet for me. The chicken omelet was wet and the whole plate was watery, it made the chips on the side all wet, gross! The Brussels sprouts came in a cute small pot which is great in presentation. The dish was flavorless, I expected something roasted and flavorful but it's not the case at all!  The service was slow! My other friend ordered the house coffee (which I think it's simple and quick, may be I'm naive?) we waited for about 15 mins for that. We told the server to check for us and he did. Then we saw the barista poured the last portion of coffee from the container. It wasn't enough for the cup then he watered it down. I was like .....  I won't come back for sure!",

We tried a range of items between us - the lavender latte (tasty), the caramel latte, the bon bon, and the kids' hot chocolate. Everyone was pleased with their drinks. I had a hard time choosing what to order for breakfast, but settled on the Latin hash 2.0 and was not disappointed. My son got the kids waffle and the whipped cream was delicious. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas - I want to try the whole menu.",

The thing that stuck out to me was the quality: the benedict and cappuccino I had were both very well prepared. Personally, the smallish portion size was perfect for me, but I can imagine it might be a bit disappointing for the average appetite. The service was a bit spotty, but it was obvious that they were trying to handle the lunch rush. But these nitpicky complaints feel like no big deal thanks to the yummy food. All in all, an enjoyable lunch spot! I would definitely eat here again if in the area!",

    "text": "DTLV is home to plenty of cute and thriving small businesses, but as a local, I'm always hesitant to make the drive up because thinking about street parking makes me tired. Paralleling is not my forte.  Luckily, we slid into a spot around the corner even at a high-traffic time like Sunday brunch day.  It was a 25 minute wait, but that was expected. The place was packed with peeps getting their brunch on. There's some lounge couches outside so at least you're comfy while waiting. And if you choose not to wait, there's a handful of other brunch spots within the vicinity.   I chose the SMOKED SALMON BENNY. Who doesn't like some oozing egg yolk action? Savory and filling. The sauteed kale and tomatillo hollandaise gave it a nice twist. It also came with a few pieces of plantain chips, keeping with the Latin-inspired menu. My cousin opted for the GARLIC LIME CHICKEN off the lunch menu, which looked like it came with mashed potatoes amongst other things. Both menus are available from 7a-4p.  I read a lot of hype surrounding their lattes here, so we both decided to try iced ones: SALTED CARAMEL for me and LAVENDER for my cousin. Our waiter accidentally brought me mine hot, but said I could just keep it. When he brought my iced one, he took back the hot one. Indian giver! In fairness, I said I wasn't going to drink both of them anyway, so shrug. Also, they seemed to run out of mason jars for us, so it was brought out in plastic cups. It honestly just reminded me of a glorified iced caramel macchiato from Starbucks, but still enjoyed it. We forgot to check in before, but 20% off your latte if you do.",

My favorite cafe closes pretty early, and my partner and I were out and about, checking out the vintage stores and antique shops in the area when I wanted coffee. Bad. Our friend had mentioned this place when we were out and about the other day, and she had raved about their coffee.   I hadn't realized it was a full on diner.   The staff was friendly, and we were greeted immediately. The place is cute, with a rad M & F sign over their bar.  I had a Mexican Spice Latte that was delicious, and totally gave me flashbacks to my nana' chocolate growing up. The service wasn't the fastest for a cafe, but this place was primarily a diner, so a bit of a wait is to be expected.   I can't wait to come back for breakfast.",

Tried calling phone number stapled on the order and it was an incorrect number. Found phone number and called to inform I was sent the wrong items and they said the item on Yelp was incorrect. It was described as smoked salmon, capers, cream cheese, tomatoes and red onion (pretty classic item)...instead I got eggs benny smoked salmon, kale, grilled tomato, and banana chip strips. Completely different ingredients one of which I'm allergic to :-(. On the phone I was told there's nothing they can do but for me to contact the delivery service. The gentleman on the phone was very nice, but they really need to update their yelp menu to prevent this. Called Grubhub and they couldn't find the order. Told they couldn't do anything either. So frustrated and hungry. So if ordering delivery, maybe call them first....",

My friend was taken with the idea of arepa benedicts, so we came here for brunch before heading back to LA. I had their Lox Benedict, and also shared the Empanada Sampler and Fries with my table.  We were super disappointed in the arepa part of the benedict - it was undercooked, bland, with no nice toasted color to it lol. The best part of my Lox Benedict was the braised kale, and it only came with 4 plantain chips. C'mon, y'all can do better than that! The empanadas were sparsely filled, making it mostly fried dough. The fries were probably the best part of the meal, with a delicious garlic aioli on top.   While service was okay, the kitchen seemed to be a mess. Our starters (the Empanadas Sampler + Fries) were the last to arrive, and it took a good 25-30 minutes for our food to come. Makers+Finders have a lot to improve on, but I can definitely see it as a great place to return to once it does!",

Orders the empanadas and a croissant sandwich. 2 couples next to us arrived much later (about 10-20 minutes after we ordered, had their orders taken and got their food within 10 minutes. Not sure how the kitchen works but this is a bit disappointing. Maybe it takes longer for them to make empanadas? Why not make a batch ahead and have them ready to fry? Server hasn't updated us either on the status of our order (i.e. busy making it, running a little behind, etc.). Unacceptable. The Nutella latte was eh. Didn't taste like Nutella. Chai latte was good.   Update: So we never got our food order because our server never put it in! He came back out asking again what we ordered and we were just floored. That was it. How'd he forget to put in our order when it wasn't even busy at all? We were maybe only the 3rd table seated when we came in at 12:15pm. Cardinal rule of serving - don't forget to put in your customers' orders! Needless to say, we were extremely upset and just asked to cancel our order. He tried to comp 1 of our meals, but at that point, we didn't want to eat here anymore. If I could give 0 stars I would, but at least he said the coffee and chai would not have to be paid for his mistake. Very poor service for a place we had high expectations.",

    "text": "The coffee is always amazing! I typically order an iced honey vanilla latte or the Mexican spiced latte. They have a variety of non-diary milks (soy and nut milks) so that's always a plus in a my book (as I am lactose intolerant).   I recently had dinner here as well and ordered the lomo saltado and the empanada sampler. I was surprised when the food arrived it wasn't as good as the coffee. The lomo saltado is sort of a deconstructed version as the fries, steak, and onions are traditionally stir-fried together but not in this dish. I did like that they added an egg though. I was underwhelmed with the empanadas because they are made with flour dough as opposed to the traditional corn dough. I generally prefer corn dough or corn tortillas to the flour versions but I know I'm also the minority in that aspect. That said, the fillings were pretty well done! I had the chicken tinga (which was my favorite), carne mechada (seasoned shredded beef), and the cheese blend. I found the rice and black beans bland (which is odd because they're flavorful all on their own but maybe they didn't add enough salt). Although the rice was really fluffy so it had a wonderful texture so I definitely finished it!   Overall this place is still 4 stars (although if I rated just the coffee it'd be 5). The service is great (even at 45 mins before closing) and staff are friendly. I would go back and try other dishes for sure.",

I loved:  a) The staff - one waiter even brought over a table for me to easily reach my drink  b) The ambiance - the outdoor seating area is so cozy, lots of seats were available, and the customers all seemed high-vibe  c) The menu - lots of fun things here to try (most coffeeshops have the same boring things - I love the options here!)  d)  They use mason jars and glasses wherever possible  e) Fast wifi  I tried the honey-vanilla latte which was great and the coconut chai overnight pudding which was a little too strong on the honey for me.   I'll definitely be back - maybe even today. :)",

Today we went to the one downtown, for breakfast for my boyfriends 21st. We went up to the bar to ask the bartender for a round, and she proceeds to tell us they take our orders at the table..and goes back to doing what she was doing. Ok. So we sit down and eat our food, no salt no pepper, no one asks if we're ok, try to get ahold of some condiments but everyone is talking behind the bar and generally not paying attention. We wait way too long to get our check. Everything is just eh. Could be a better place.",

    "text": "I found this place on my commute to work and was very excited and decided to try it on my day off which is Sunday. Oddly enough they are closed on Sundays. So I decided to try again yesterday. The coffee menu is very small and their prices are very high. My favorite place is Sunrise Coffee! Anyways my fiance ordered a small latte with 2 shots of espresso and I ordered an iced vanilla small size. The cups were I believe 12 ounces and they do not carry iced beverage cups so I felt very awkward drinking mine through the sippy lid. My fiance enjoyed his and mine was absolutely not delicious and not worth the $5.25 I paid for it. Now here's why I'm giving them 1 star otherwise I may have given a 2 possibly three. We arrived today, Christmas Eve at 7:52 as the hours state 7am-4pm and there was not any signage posted for holiday hours. We were turned away because they don't open until 8. We left as we had to head to work. Got off early today and decided to try again. Now there's a sign saying closed on Christmas which is very fair. Walked in and approached the counter and saw two male employees and was told they were closed. It was 12:30 I'm sorry but that is extremely poor business. And why were the doors unlocked?? For this place only being open 7 weeks you would think they would want to try and build a strong loyal customer base. But nope not here. Not going to be returning again. Prices were too high for the quality we received. $4.50 for the 12 ounce latte with only a single shot. For an extra shot it's $.50 more to add vanilla $.75 more. So my drink is now $5.75 for a 12 ounce cup that's not even meant to hold cold beverages.",

It is so cute and yummy that I want to say good things about it but don't because I don't want this place to get over crowded and lose it's charm.  Selfish, I know!  The outdoor patio in front of the shop is a perfect place to enjoy good company on a beautiful day.  It reminds me of someplace you would find in California somewhere.   Do yourself a favor and get the lavender latte!!  I usually order a cappuccino and don't put sugar or any sweeteners in it so I was afraid the lavender syrup would be too sweet.  But it's not, it's deliciously amazing!  I've tried it with almond milk but it slightly over powers the lavender flavor.   I've also had the shrimp and brussel sprouts which was good.  I just wish it was on the southwest side of town vs downtown so I could go more often!",

Each drink (even drip coffee!) is made individually by hand, and my god are they good.  Easily the best chai I've had since moving to LV.  I also got the veggie bagel, which was surprisingly flavorful and distinctive for something that seems so simple.

But asking for a cappuccino. I usually get a latte. I'm not much for doctored up drinks. So the flavored beverages don't really do anything for me. I just want perfectly steamed milk with an espresso shot that is extracted properly. I've had some good meals here, but I cannot say that they were great. I really want to like this place. And I do. But it makes it difficult for me to want to come back. I've tried a lot of apreas and I have had one here that was cooked right. The Greek yogurt was great, but again. That's a hard one to mess up. A salad here and there was tasty. But I've also had greens that tasted old and extremely bitter. Odd in fact. So again, there's no consistency. It feels like everyone is on their own wavelength. I will always be willing to give it another shot.",

I am now obsessed over this coffee. I ordered this flavor at another popular place in Summerlin and it was an epic fail. ONLY Makers & Finders makes a kick butt lavender latte.

    "text": "This place was amazing. We came here for food before heading over to Hop Mule on an early afternoon trip to downtown from the strip. It's a short walk from the SDX or Deuce to get over here.  First, the coffee. We each got a cold brew iced coffee, which was a nice, satisfyingly cold beverage for a hot afternoon.   Then, the food. I ordered the Rajas Arepa, having never had an arepa before, but it sounded like something I'd be a fan of. Before too long, I was trying one for the first time, and... just, wow. Lots of great flavors mixed together, everything prepared proportioned nicely to the other ingredients. Plus, the sweet potato/yam/??? chips that were on the side? Those were amazing. I just wanted an entire box of those to-go, they were crunchy but melt-in-your-mouth with just the right amount of seasoning.  There's no doubt in my mind that we'll be back.",

Great place to meet people, study, chat. I ordered the lavender infused latte. I have to say it was hands down one of my favorite latte. For one it wasn't basic like most are. It had a great balance of sweet and the lavender wasn't over powering. Then I had the smoked lox. I probably eat bagel and lox at least once or twice a week since I'm big on seafood, but that has to be one of the best iv had. I'm really happy I actually came across maker and finders, and will be going back with all my girls.",

This location has the best chai in Las Vegas in my opinion; it differs from everyone else in that it doesn't taste like artificial overly sweet vanilla. I also happen to enjoy hanging out in local coffee shops as opposed to the likes of Big Green.  From what I have been told, this is one of the go to spots if you happen to enjoy coffee and espresso as well; it sure smells good to me.  According to Yelp checkins I have been here twenty-four times. I can say that each one of those times the service has been good and the food quality is great. I typically get the breakfast bagel, Latin hash or one of the arepas; if they have a special omelette on the board I'll get that too. Portions are not overly large and that's fine because, let's face it, American's are fat...so, I sometimes have room for a second helping of the chai.",

I chose to bring Costa Rican friends here because they didn't want to wait in the long lines at brunch places on the strip. Although we didn't have to wait in line to get seated here it took 40 minutes to get our coffees and another hour to get the food. By the time our food came our coffees were gone and we weren't offered refills. I ordered a chocolate croissant. My two friends got their food and 10 minutes passed so I decided to ask about my croissant. The waitress told me they ran out of dough so they were making it and it would be another 10 minutes. Could you have told me that an hour ago? Or when you brought my friends food? I told her to forget it and decided not to eat because I didn't want to be there all day. So if you're really hungry -beware you'll be waiting a while for your food.",

The waiter saw me, but I had to stand and wait what felt like a long time to be acknowledged. I finally told him I wanted a latte \"to go\" and gave my order to the guy behind the bar. Again I felt awkward and out of place, idk just got that vibe from the staff. My latte took an uncomfortably long time to be ready, and when I got it, it was cold! The place wasn't crowded at the time, so I'm assuming they're sending me the message \" Don't come back! You're too old and not the type of cliente we want here!! Won't be going back.",

Once it came out, they gave my boyfriend a sweet drink that definitely wasn't his, and then gave me a Mexican latte. I told the server it wasn't what I ordered and her response was \"it's kind of like it, it's still spiced.\" Mmm... okay I really had a craving for chocolate but I guess it wasn't going to get satisfied.

I was not disappointed I had the egg white omelet and a keto friendly bulletproof coffee. The omelet was amazing they even substituted their regular side choices for a side salad with apple cider vinegar dressing (added by the server) without my request once I mentioned I was on keto. Very pleasent surprise. The coffee was rich and cramy not bitter at all. My boyfriend had the salmon and eggs he devoured it. So I can only assume it was delicious since it dissappeared so fast I didn't even get a taste . All in all this place is a must try coffee and breakfast spot. It won't dissapoint!!",

It was perfectly sweetened with a strong enough lavender that you can actually taste it. The lox toast was also very good. I would pass on the plantain chips and opt for some fruit instead. The croissant sandwich was pretty generic. Nothing special for the $9.50 price tag. The croissant reminds me of the Costco bought ones. Minus one star for not honoring the Yelp check in coupon. The waitress said they didn't accept it anymore but it's still on yelp. That's False advertisement if you came here expecting to be able to use it, but they wouldn't honor it. So a heads up!",

I think 2 1/2 would be more fitting, but my bf gives them a solid 2..lol  I was really excited to try this adorable little cafe after hearing what great vegan options they have. But considering how bland the vegan empanada bowl was, I probably should have gotten the vegan burger or vegan hash? The server recommended it so I got it. My bf thought his meal was pretty mediocre & also mentioned the poor service, but I didn't think it was THAT bad considering how busy they were. We weren't left without refills so it wasn't a big deal to me. I just think that considering it is a CAFE that serves coffee & tea, the servers could be a BIT more accommodating in regards to their coffees & tea. LOL  For instance - our first server gave my bf a cold tea instead of hot tea. My bf did forget to specify, but before he could get her back to correct her she brought an ice tea. Shouldn't a server at a cafe make sure you're getting the right tea?? And when I asked our second server about the flavor profile of this specific matcha tea, she couldn't describe the tea even though she's had it before??? Tasted like seaweed. LOL So yeah, that was annoying. They also serve their water in dirty, glass milk bottles. I'm a vegan so it wasn't appetizing to see crusty old cow t----- juice on the rim. (GAG). When I asked if they filtered their water the first server gave a very annoyed \"no.\" LOL Uh, sorry that I like clean water?? We also thought it was really bizarre how the servers didn't ask if we wanted cream, sugar, honey etc. Nor was there any salt/pepper on our table or offer to bring any.  All in all, it's not a terrible place if you're stranded somewhere & there's NOTHING else around, but this is VEGAS so why settle & pay for medicore food??",

My wife; a very stern critique for the pour over; did appreciate the coffee but the brew wasn't there for her.  She noted it needed more grounds for a stronger cup.  We did have to ask for cream and sugar which is below par for such a high rated well reviewed coffee shop in the cool part of town.  Oh well the service is sometimes off especially being at the end of the day.  And I got a generic design in my latte felt like it was put together very abhorrently...looking back it would've been an awkward question to ask what exactly the design was lol.  All the cons are very nominal in the end and the flavor and quality of coffee is top notch.",

The Benedict came out super sloppy and like they just threw fajita veggies under the eggs. The arepa was pure mush (it was more like polenta) and the chimichurri was so overpowering, it was just too much. The consistency of the whole dish was off. We also didn't receive our Bloody Mary's until we were 1/2 way through our meal. I saw that the bartender didn't even start them until after we got our food, and they still took much longer to come out. They were also unbearably spicy. We both love spicy food and by no means are sensitive to spice, but these couldn't even be consumed as it was burning our throats. It ruined the whole thing, we both left without drinking them.",

It was really quiet and they have a nice patio area out front that is very welcoming. My partner and I ate here two days in a row, because it was so good. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu and you can order from the lunch and breakfast menu a majority of the day. Lots of Latin inspired flavors and the plantain chips were a great side with all my meals. The wait staff and hostess were very friendly and attentive. The cortado and macchiato I had was delicious and both days the food was on point. This is going on my list of places to recommend to friends when they visit.",

If you are into Latin style food this is the place for you!  My favorite & most outstanding dish would be the SMOKED SALMON BENEDICT. One of the best breakfasts I've ever had!  Other than the great coffee the customer service has always treated me like royalty! CODY who has served me multiple times has always been on point with giving me an amazing experience! I believe he is may be the  manager because usually the baristas make my coffee but he always makes sure I get what I want & happy with my selections! If I could do more than 5 stars it would be 15! SALUTE to CODY & the makers & finders staff for being amazing!",

The coffee was fantastic- the Mexican spice latte, matcha latte, and salted caramel lattes are so delicious. The food is also so fantastic- my favorites are the waffles and tomato basil bagel. The bagel has fresh tomatoes and balsamic and fresh basil- I couldn't eat it fast enough. The waffles are also so tasty and come with beautiful fruit and coconut!! The manager here and entire staff here is also so kind and gracious. I love this place so much I made sure to bring my mom here when she came into town :)",

    "text": "In a nutshell: Hip, fun, delightful.  Second time visit, did not disappoint either time.   This is a super charming, very hip, food and coffee hangout spot located in the happening Arts District Downtown. The interior is fantastically decorated, very modern and very conducive to conversation amongst friends. The bar area has plug-ins for your laptop or phone. Their espresso machine is also a really good one if you happen to know about espresso machines. The menu has a lot to offer, including vegan options and GF options, skewed towards Latin flavors. There is also free WiFi. Today I ordered a Salted Caramel Latte, a Hibiscus iced tea, and a Lavender Latte with soy milk. My Carmel latte was terrific, hot, perfect ratio of milk to espresso. I had a sip of my wife's hibiscus iced tea, which was not only a very pretty color, but also delightfully good. The lavender latte was a score with our friend as well, as she reported the flavor wasn't over powering as some others she'd had at other places.  At this place you have the option of simply walking up to the counter to order drinks and such to go, or you can be seated by the host. All the workers are very nice and efficient.   I like this place and plan on a time to try their food and sit. Will return and would recommend.",

In the past, I've never strayed too far away from the Avocado Toast but I've recently learned that I'm allergic to practically everything so I made a go for the Veggie Hash ... You'd never know that it was vegetarian!  The restaurant is very low key but incredibly welcoming and the servers are always polite. I'd definitely recommend calling ahead if you have a party that is bigger than 4-5 people as it's always busy.",

They have an patio but it was too hot to seat out so I made my way inside. Service was prompt and I already knew what I wanted to eat. I ordered the Hibiscus mimosa, chicken Tonga omelette with bacon and avocado and the Coconut Tres Leches. The mimosa was just okay my think it would've tasted better with some syrup. The Omelette was the star of the show. The waffle was underwhelming but I guess I had really high expectations. It's still the best bfast I've had in Vegas so far so I'll definitely recommend.  Pros . Excellent  Service and omelette . I'll try other cocktails next time",

The quality of food was so fresh and they were right on point with presentation. You could tell they really paid attention to detail with the dishes they were serving.  Also ordered a hot coffee to go. Wasn't as impressed with the coffee as I was with the food. But maybe the flavor latte I picked was a miss.  Would love to go back next time I'm in Vegas. If you're looking for a good joint don't pass them up.",

We split the tres leche coconut waffle, chicken tinga eggs benedict, and breakfast empanadas and they were all SO GOOD. the shell of the empanadas if cooked to perfection - so flaky and delicious.   I would love to come back here and try some more of the menu - maybe for lunch and dinner! they also have outdoor seating which is lovely for a nice day out. not to mention that the staff is so kind and attentive!",

    "text": "Visited on 7-16-16 at about 9:30am.  This restaurant is located on Main St. between Charleston and Oakey.  It is surrounded by antique stores so it was fun to eat and then go peruse for some treasures.  We were able to find free street parking on the side of the building.    $36.77 got us two coffees, a side of fruit for the boy, an arepa benny, and chilaquiles.  The decor is hipster but not in an exclusive way...the decor and service are very welcoming.  I like their unusual artwork on the walls.    $3.75 Iced espresso machiatto- I couldn't help but giggle when they put this thing in front of me.  It was served in a 4 oz. mason jar.  I am used to Starbucks' version I guess but this really threw me off.  My husband exclaimed, \"WHAT IS THIS, A MACHIATTO FOR ANTS?\" I guess Starbucks is like the Wal-Mart of coffees and this is what a proper machiatto looks like.  It was very strong.  I experienced complete awareness after I drank it.   $10 arepa benny- had golden poached eggs, coffee rubbed beef, grilled tomatoes, and salsa verde hollandaise.  It's the only hollandaise I've ever liked.  The beef was nicely spiced, salty, and tender.  I highly recommend this!   $10 chilaquiles- A small iron skillet with scrambled eggs, tortilla chips that have been dipped in chile sauce, black beans, and cojita cheese.  This was my first experience with chilaquiles.  It's basically soggy tortilla chips and eggs.  It was extremely spicy.  I'm glad I got to try it but I don't think I'd ever eat it again.  It had very good flavor, though.    This place is much more friendly than the other douchey hipster coffee shops and their food was really good.  I highly recommend this place.",

I will say I am NOT A LATTE PERSON. I drink my coffee with a little half and half with a a dash of sweetener, but still like the flavor of coffee present. I had a regular cup of coffee which was nothing special, just like the food.  THE FOOD: The food is not that great... Pretty bland. My lady odered the Arepa Benny, which I could care less. We also tried the Lavender Latte which wasn't bad, but also nothing special.   THE PRICE: About as much as you would expect for hispters in a coffee shop.   THE VIBE: TOOK FOREVER! It was not super crowded but the food and coffee took a really long time. The staff was super friendly, but geez their cook must be cooking with one hand cuz that took way too long, although, if he was cooking with one hand I am thoroughly impressed. Nothing special about the decor. Not fancy but not dirty, just that typical... \"hey im a hipster drinking coffee\" vibe.  OVERALL: Nothing special... I have had better, and considering you are in vegas and off the strip, it is guaranteed you can find better.",

    "text": "Sad to have finally paid this place a visit to have had the worst experience with a guest from out of town.  Being a local downtown homeowner for 20 years, I was excited to finally have had the chance to experience this place. Needless to say that experience was so bad that I'll never give a second chance.  From the moment of checking in for a table which took 15 mins for a party of 2 to not being addressed at the bar for a good 10 mins, to not being able to order waffles since they didn't have their waffle machine to not being about to order a coffee with whipped cream since they gave up their whipped cream machine to their other new location. The only pleasant thing was the foodserver who was apologetic.  Obviously the 2 at the host stand knew we were leaving without ordering and should have addressed us as we left but all we got was have a nice day. If plans to succeed are in order, then this place needs to pull it together.",

Overall cute place but many things are expensive but that's common in adorable coffee shops.  Things I've tried:  Tomato soup: WOW. This is sooo good. I love a good tomato soup and this one is a winner   Chipotle chicken sandwich-delicious delicious spicy chicken. Wish it was bigger or had more stuff within the sandwich   Plantain chips-eh   Maduros-sweet plantains. I asked for a side of these because of love them so much. Not on the menu but they were able to accommodate. YUM. Love love love   Kale ceasar-pretty good, wish it was larger for the price   Lavender latte & lavender vanilla lattes-both fantastic my favorite part of this place and reason I'll keep coming back. On the pricier side but worth it.   Raja  Arepa Benny   Both above were pretty similar. Love the sweet plantains with the raja. Wish it had more spice.",

The waiter was somewhat awkward, i ordered a croissant sandwhich and all it literally had inside was egg and cheese. I wish i would've ordered something else, since the sandwhich was so dull. I also orted the Lavender Fog Tea, i love it! Seriously recomended, reminds me of London.",

    "text": "THIS REVIEW COMES WITH A FUNNY STORY. (But it's still relevant to this review so don't worry)   A great hole in the wall coffee shop that offers delicious Cuban breakfast meals, sandwhiches, sweets, and a variety of coffee. I ordered the Arepa Benny $10 (which seems pretty popular via Yelp) and a Honey Vanilla Latte $5.50. The Benny was amaaaazing! The yolk broke perfectly and their hollandaise was delicious. The latte was also equally delicious. It was actually reccommended by our server.   Okay here's my funny story: When you walk into Makers & Finders there is (or should I say was) a wooden bench that's connected to the entire right side of the wall. Those seats are obviously intended for 2 people parties. Well anyway... my cousin and I have already been seated and eating for a good 30 mins, then a group of 2 men sat at the table next to us; 1 guy on the chair and 1 on the bench. A couple minutes after that, a friend of theirs walks through the door and sits next to the guy on the bench. At that moment I hear a loud \"crrraaaccckk\" and instantly think \"This sh** is about to break.\" Then literally seconds after that, a woman they knew walks up to the second man on the bench and hugs him. Right when she goes in for the hug and puts her weight onto him the whole entire bench disconnects from the wall. True story. No one fell onto the floor or got hurt or anything, but the fact that the bench detatches itself from their concrete wall is pretty insane lol. The staff and the owner were extremely apologetic and kept making sure everyone was okay. My cousin and I actually got free dessert out of it lol. But the reason why I wanted to add that story in is because, although I had a near death experience (jk), I'm still giving them a 5 star rating lol. And THAT, ladies and gentleman, is how great their food, coffee, and service was! ... Just not their bench.",

    "text": "Makers & Finders: Urban Coffee Bar  I was in the mood for something trendy and have wanted to try this place for a while, so here I find myself... downtown, hair still yet to be brushed unless you count my pillow as a brush, and in plaid pants and a shirt that reads \"WILL RUN FOR WINE.\" I guarantee you I will do just about anything for wine.   The outdoor area is spacious for a small location and more importantly, not overcrowded with tables AND clean. Upon walking in I am pleasantly greeted and find a nice small seat. The decor is unassuming, clean, and welcoming. Again, spacious. There is plenty of room to move, unlike so many other restaurants that try to cram in as many tables as they can. The waiter is warm and soft spoken with a light accent.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a Hispanic theme to the menu (see how I do my research first...blindly) but needed some form of caffeine running thru my veins before I could comprehend words I feel like I should know but couldn't process while still foggy from laziness. My eyes immediately gravitated toward the Lavender Infused Latte. Done. Two shot of espresso on the side as well, please. And I logged on to the ever encompassing internet after not having it for a week, I am hoping my inbox hasn't self-destructed in my neglect. The waiter came back to ask if I really wanted 2 espresso shots on the side...I knew there was one in the latte right? He was still all smiles and sweet, he really was just trying to make sure I didn't make my heart explode, or perhaps accepted full responsibility for it. I assured him my ticker could handle the caffeine he was going to deliver.   The latte wasn't sweet. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It is served with a little heart in the foam, I wonder if I am the only one that finds that humorous? The latte is magnificent. It is creamy and clean. No after taste and the lavender is gentle, it isn't like swallowing Bath and Body Works Lavender Bath Bomb. There is no pull of artificial flavoring and the lavender opens more as the latte cools to room temperature. The espresso...I don't even remember it. But I do know this...I don't remember it because it was smooth, it was properly brewed, and left no after taste. I remember it because I can start to feel its wonderful buzzing in my skull without the need to wash a bitter flavor away.  Ok. Caffeinated. Can digest menu now. Hah. Pun.   Ripened Mango Arepa. For those of you that don't know what an Arepa is, I have graciously googled it for you. It's a corn pocket thingy that is crunchy on the outside and still creamy inside. In other words, it's fucking delicious. The menu description is as simple as this: Ripened Mango, avocado, queso fresco, basil and thyme aioli. The flavors were surprising and dynamic, though I wish the mango was a bit more pronounced and the side of sauce they served with it was a bit heavy handed. The only real comment I have on this is to please serve with a sharper knife. The arepa is so beautifully done but it has to all get squished to be cut and the flavors are all lost. It's like a treasure hunt to appropriately self-balance the flavors on one's own fork, I assure you it was well worth the task, BUT...a sharper knife would have been perfect to slice thru that buccal artistry.  In conclusion. Get better parking. I like it here.   **disclaimer:No idea if they sell Lavender Bath Bombs but one would assume...I am not girly enough for that.**",

If you have a hankering for something different then M&F would be the place to quench your pallet, except the service was terrible. TERRIBLE!  We were  seated promptly and the waiter introduced himself, said he would give us some time to decide and then everything went south. Timing is everything with serving and this guy had no idea what he was doing. We had to wait too long for him to come back and take our coffee order. So we ordered our food as well when he finally  showed returned. The food came out BEFORE our coffee hit the table, not good. BTW not all our food made it. A $15 order of empanadas never made it. So the order was comped. Because our coffee came late we only had one cup each and  that also cost the owner profits. No manager made it over to our table to see how things were going and given the price of the food you'd expect to see a little team support. This our second time here and both times had a similar experience. PROBABLY won't be back.",

It wasn't the \"downtown\" I had in mind when I read the reviews (closer to the outlets than to Fremont St), but the place was cute and clean.   As a coffee house, I'd probably give a higher rating, but was disappointed in the good service - especially since we came in to eat. While my arepa Benny was quite good, my husband's croissant sandwich was lackluster. There were only 2-3 other tables of people while we were there, but it took more than 10min to get my Mexican Spice latte (which was delicious) and felt like another 25 min. To get our meal.   The coffee was great and different. I'd probably come back to hang out with a friend over coffee (and order at the counter)... if I happened to be in the area",

I didn't like how the flavor matched up. I felt like there was just too much going on fore such a basic order. And my friend had a turkey sandwich, which seemed to be a little dry. The staff was a little stiff also. Took our bar server sometime to even greet us. Then ignored us majority of the time we were sitting. Overall. I may have not liked the food or the service, but the coffee will defiantly make me crawl back. Willing to give them another try.",

I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but this beats a lot of local coffee shops in Vegas (not that there were very many good ones to begin with). I would definitely make this one of my go-to spots",

While the waitress did apologize for the wait and not bringing water immediately, it was a bit awkward to wait that long while there were several open tables. We will visit again when we're back in Vegas. Also they had one of the best chai lattes I've tasted.",

We were so excited to go because my husband is a huge coffee fan and loves trying new places in town - PLUS all of the great reviews that there were. However, our server Josie was in such a rush and saw us only to seat us and take our order. She even passed us multiple times after we received our meals and still never asked how we were or if we needed anything. I was pointing to what I wanted to eat when ordering and she still suggested something else which gave me the impression that the meal I originally wanted wouldn't be good enough. My husband said that his sandwich that he ordered tasted so bland and plain and wasn't satisfying at all. The only two good things that came out of this was our coffee and the gentleman that was helping us throughout our meal since our server wasn't helping. If I had cash on me I would have tipped him rather than our server. We both are in the restaurant/hospitality industry so we understand the importance of customer service - just wish our server understood that as well. We unfortunately won't be going back to makers & finders...",

We walked in when they were just a minute or two from closing (not on purpose) but they were very sweet and didn't mind making us a cup of coffee to go. The decor is urban, rustic. I had a lavender coconut milk latte and my boyfriend had a salted caramel latte. I LOVE that they have a house-made lavender syrup. My latte was very creamy with just the right amount of flower essence. Both lattes were light on the flavor which I really enjoy. I still like my coffee to taste like coffee so that's my preference ;) we will definitely be returning to Makers and Finders!",

Honey vanilla latte is fantastic as well. Never sweet and extremely creamy and well balanced.   Food prices are a bit high in my opinion, but it is delicious. Worth grabbing a small bite with your drink. The Arepa Roja was very yummy.  Fantastic staff. Best coffee spot in Vegas.",

Working in the food industry and customer service there are basic Do's and Don'ts that go along with working as a server and our server did a HUGE DONT!!!! before we even got our bill we got kicked out because they had people waiting.  They clearly have a patio area that they could open up and serve there but instead they chose to let their customers know they need tables cleared and people are waiting so we had to either hang out at the bar (which was clearly full) or leave.  This was all before dropping our check.  I've never been more insulted in my life.",

If you don't want whole milk, they also have almond milk available. You can place orders online which is very helpful when you need to grab your drink and go.

I have been here 5 or 6 times and every time I come it's more and more busy.  That being said the quality of the food and service has gone down.  My server was fine but he had quite a few tables so it reflected in his attitude and body language.  And since the front was understaffed I can imagine that the back was understaffed as well since I ordered a dish that came out cold. I asked them to please heat up my food and put it in a Togo container so I could eat it on my way home only to find that my food was cold in the Togo container.  I hope management gets it together to come out with a way to make the current staff function better or to hire more for front and back to relive some stress of the current staff.",

Has a very bright, clean and modern latin feel. Loved the music.   We ordered mexican spiced mocha and the iced matcha latte with coconut milk. The mocha was delicious--not too sweet but also not bitter. The iced matcha isn't like the starbucks matcha--it's a little stronger and less sweet but not anything I couldn't handle.   We ordered the chicken tinga empanada. We loved it so much we ordered some to-go for the ride home. The pulled pork benny was also good--it came with plantain chips and I thought that was a nice touch to their menu. It is \"latin comfort food\" as they like to call it.  Service was great. We asked the server questions about the food--she was knowledgable and recommended some of the food she likes. There are gluten-free, vegeterian and vegan options for those who have diet preferences.  Parking wasn't too great, we got lucky there were some empty spots across the street and there was some construction going on. Not their fault at all so I will not dock any stars.",

    "text": "After an appointment in the Medical District, my mom and I decided to head to the Arts District to try a spot that I had been to before. Upon arrival, the place wasn't there anymore. Sad face. I did my usual, go to Yelp for the next best place and came across Makers & Finders, which offers Latin comfort food, and glanced reviews about their coffee and lattes. We shrugged our shoulders and said sure, why not, it's a new place.  When we walked up, we saw there was seating outside, which the weather was perfect. When we walked in, we were greeted and seated right away. The lady gave us a run down of the menu, and the coffees that they offer. My mom ordered the Lavender Latte and it came out so pretty. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I tried the latte and said I should have ordered one for myself it was so smooth. I feel like we were sent here, because while we were waiting to place our order, what to my wandering eyes did appear, but Catherine Cortez Masto appear! What a pleasant surprise. She and two ladies had a seat right behind my mom and we \"brunched\" together haha! All the staff greeted her and she was seated. Nothing changed with staff, they didn't all suddenly change their attitude because she was there. If anything they were excited she was there. But they all were very nice and attentive already!   In no time was the lady back to take our order for food.  I ordered Roasted Rajas Empanadas and Yucca Mash which is yucca, green onions mashed. That sounded so funky to me. I had yucca before, fried and sauteed, but never mashed. I took one bite and that was it. I was sold. I said to my mom she needed to try some and after her first bite, she kept dipping her fork in to get more. The empanadas were tasty too. Peppers were perfect with the dough. Complimented each other well. Definitely comfort food, as I was very pleased with my food. Did my little chair dance.    When we were done eating, we got to take a picture with CCM and wished her luck.My mom and I left happy and comforted, and glad we came across Makers & Finders. The latte is one to come back for.",

Inside of the restaurant really cute.   Service was a bit slow. Drinks were delicious. We had an iced chai tea latte dirty (shot of espresso) and a lavender fog tea.   I ordered a simple bagel sandwich which I didn't like. It was a lot of bagel. And they went heavy on the avocado cream cheese which made it feel greasy.

The crisp, clean, decor had an artistic flare that while somewhat hipster was also uniquely styled and inviting. Since I'd read here that each day lavender syrup is made on site I ordered the lavender latte while hubby chose the coconut turmeric tea. Our waitress suggested a warm hot chocolate for our young one and the taste and temperature were spot on for him. From the menu we ordered the waffle with fruit for little one, breakfast hash and chicken Benny. The food was beautifully presented and flavors bounced to the perfect level. The energy was calming yet vibrant and I wanted to stay and try many more items from the menu though vowed to return another time.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars   My sister and I ordered the Arepa Benny and the Coconut Tres Leches Waffle to share. The Arepa Benny was the best twist on the classic Eggs Benedict that I've had in a while. I enjoyed the texture light polenta like biscuit, and the spiced up Hollandaise paired nicely with the Arepa meat. The plaintain chips that came on the side were also vert nice. My only complaint would be that the poached egg was slightly overcooked so it wasn't as runny as I would have liked. The waffle was also solid. I  Iiked the Tres Leches cream and blueberry compote, but in my opinion the chocolate bits kind of threw off the other flavors. I also sampled a bit of my grandma's Soyrizo Asparagus dish, and really liked it. The soyrizo's spiciness went very well with the slight bitterness of the asparagus.   As for drinks, I ordered the Lavender infused latte. As a latte it was good, but I would have liked more lavender flavor. I could smell the lavender from the bits sprinkled on top, but when I drank it the strong cocoa flavor overwhelmed the lavender.  Food and drinks took a while, but it was to be expected for our party of 10. Our waiter was also very helpful, patient, and served us with a smile. The decor is trendy and pleasant, and the \"I like big cups and I cannot lie\" sign outside the door was cute.  Make sure to check in on Yelp if it is your first time to get 20% off one of their specialty lattes! Overall, Makers & Finders was a great Latin infused brunch, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",

    "text": "What has happened to Makers&Finders?   Two years ago when I moved to Las Vegas, M&F was one of the first coffee houses and restaurants I visited. We had a Yelp Elite event hosted here, featuring all things coffee. It was spectacular.  Since then, I've been back a few times, including for my birthday breakfast a year ago, and things were still swell. I liked introducing visiting tourist friends and family to this local hub. A solid 4-star experience between ambiance, uniqueness and quality of food offerings for the area, friendly and attentive service, and fine coffee and alcohol offerings.   Fast forward to today, I wanted to introduce a friend of mine to coffee spots in the downtown area. M&F was at the top of my list. But it had been months since I last visited, so fingers crossed things would still be top notch.  Not so.  In short: - the barista, who apparently is new'ish, was a bundle of nerves, rapid-fire chatter. I don't care how toked up you are on your own product, but calm the delivery, because you're making these two customers feel rushed and a burden. - mad confusion over the use of the Yelp check-in discount. I was asked, \"what's the name on the ticket?\" What ticket? I don't work here. Just apply the discount. Or don't! I don't care. This exchange added some 5-minutes to delivery as they had to find someone else to untangle the register. And when I placed my card on the bill just after it was put in front of me? Ignored. Not busy...just wiping down some serving trays and idle chit-chat with one another while I stood there. Looking. Waiting. But when I said, \"yo, can you run this?\" one of the three now present sprung into action. Thanks! - confusion as to where sugar and other coffee add-ins were located for my friend to self-doctor her iced coffee. - said iced coffee was not of the quality I remember from back in the day. And $4 for a letdown?  Nah.  - my latte glass mug had a chip in it. Some idiot could cut themselves. Check that, maybe, before serving?  - it took some 10-15 minutes to make these two drinks happen, and to conclude the $ transaction. Good lord. It's just coffee. And less than $10.   All that is to explain why my first year's experience with M&F was an easy 4-star, but today's disappointment dropped them to perfectly average. I've always loved the food in the past and the atmosphere. But customer service was super lacking today and not impressive at all to the New one. I know she won't be back. I will be, but not without concern for consistency of delivery.",

The patio outside is cute, but the Vegas heat is not forgiving. I love the coffee bar menu, and the Italian espressos were a great wake me up to start my Sunday. If I didn't have mommy duties after brunch, I would totally have ordered some mimosas as there were so many flavors that sounded amazing! I got chilaquiles which was a good size portion and had a lime, spicy kick. I ordered the chilaquiles as is on the menu, but next time I might try to see if I could get a sunny side egg on top instead as the scrambled egg on the bottom was over cooked. Service was really friendly, and very attentive with no rush.",

I was working on some stuff and I ended up asking another service and she said let me ask... she said the cooks would get mad if she asked.

    "text": "Coffee; really great and fantastic espresso coffee is one of my deepest darkest secrets!  By the end of this review I might need to seek a priest and confess the deep desirable relationship that I share with this fascinating drink!  This particular visit was an interesting outing for me and the LV Crystals Group! The fabulous staff here reserved a huge table for 13 plus people and handled all of our needs most efficiently. The staff was virtuously and effortlessly able to handle ten plus separate or spilt checks and did it so elegantly!  Each month the crystal  guru of the group sets up these prearranged meeting months in advance, but the only condition is that they need to be Vegan establishments; or Vegan primary! Michelle's vision is to bring similar individuals together that share her vision with Crystals and Vegan delights in LV! Michelle is such a warm and beautiful person that represents the LV community in so many ways! She is such a giver and the unions that she comes up with for our monthly gatherings are always something I look forward too! Plus it is a forged path that she establishes with local businesses to showcase what they have to offer! Plus I get to review every outing and Yelp about it! It's a win-win!  As a member of the Yelp Elite I feel respect and responsibility to represent the said business that one is reporting or (Yelping) on! FYI: Yelping is a noun and a verb for us dedicated to the yelp universe; elite or not! If your yelp it's a fantastic family that loves and cares for each other! If your not then just download the app and go find a place to review. That simple!  Our order was handled in this fashion: the staff took all of our drink orders and then delivered them! Next was the order process; which is a great way to sample all the wonderful delights of the menu. The Vegan menu here is extensive and very delicious. With so many wonderful and amazing individuals around me most of us shared a bite here bonding even deeper over great food.   Deep breath here goes with my obsession again; with this lunch date I decided to have black coffee with an add shot of espresso. Coffee done black with an add shot is highly recommended here. One does not even need sugar to enjoy it; just a few ice cubes! With my meal I had the London Fog! I quickly found out what the fog part was when I found out that it was milk! Duh! This drink comes iced and they even remade it with no a word; swapping the milk for almond! Thanks for this! They are amazing here!  After getting my veins back to pumping with sweet sinful caffeine I had the salad for lunch it was so delicious. This salad was kale based Caesar salad! The Parmesan and dressing I asked for on the side! Croutons come on top too! The dressing of the kale salad was something that I enjoyed doing ! The dressing was a little strong so did not use most of. One of my crystal friends had the expanada sampler which was so amazing. This plate is Vegan and has four different choices all in one plate. Perfect for sharing! The vegi flavored empanada was my favorite of the four. It goes best with the hot salsa on top too! Spicy is always more delicious; and healthier I've been told!  So now that I have confessed to my favorite obsession and desire I no longer need to see the priest. I'll do three Hail Marys and return here for that secret desire that fills my life with glee. This is one of my favorite places to have my secret coffee desires fulfilled.  Come and see if they can make your deepest magical dreams of caffeine brought to fruition!",

I have also fallen in love with the cuban cortado, this is overtaking Publicus and Vesta for weekend breakfast.",

I chose the Mexican spiced mocha. Very tasty. But their hibiscus latte, lavender lattes, and mimosas to boot. I also chose the churro waffle, but the Benedict's, croissant sandwiches, and power breakfasts were also enjoyed. The waiter was very friendly and didn't rush us even when it was very busy at the time.",

Ultimately, she decided to seat us because we were only a party of four.  We all got bottomless mimosas. The regular Champaign and OJ is $22. If you want any other flavor, like hibiscus or lavender, it's $26 - I believe.  Food was awesome. We all cleaned our plates. The Benedicts were amazing, according to friends, my husband got the Lomo Saltado (because you can order from the lunch menu at 10:00 a.m.!) and practically licked his plate. I ordered the chicken tinga omelette with plantain chips. So flavorful!  The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is because of our server. She was nice and attentive enough. However, bottomless mimosas are only served for two hours. She gave us our check when we still had 45 minutes on the clock. Not to sound like a boozer - it's brunch - we wanted to take full advantage!  A little noisy, however, it's a jovial noise and vibe. Will return.",

We ordered bottomless mimosas, our server marquee was really nice and attentive. However, it took about 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive.   Food came it was good and we were really having a good time. However about an hour into our meal we were told we were cut off. There was no warning whatsoever. Yeh we were a big group and we were keeping to ourselves and having a good time but if there was someone who came to us and mentioned we were disturbing other guests then we would of gladly complied. That didn't happen and we were asked to leave. For a whole group paying about $500 to be treated that way does not sit right with us as a group.   Other members of my group also made the same review, there is no way that we would come here again.",

Staff was incredibly attentive and sweet ( except one server who we asked for the check and completely forgot, until we had to ask someone else 30 min later)  Came in shortly after 4. Sadly I missed the breakfast and lunch menu. But we got the empanada sampler. My favorite was the short rib and shrimp. The shrimp empanada was nicely filled and flavourful. It's about 5 different empanada with 3 different sauces. The outside was golden brown and crunchy with warm fillings. Unfortunately I was starving and didn't take a picture.  I also got  a honey vanilla latte with 2% milk and it was delicious. Honey was not overwhelming. Good mix.  My husband got the Mexican chocolate latte and he enjoyed. He's not a big coffee fan either.   Only reason I'm taking off one star is because their dinner menu is very limited. Not much to offer and nothing seemed appetizing for me as the other day time menus were.",

Our first server was awesome. Very knowledgeable and sweet. Then we were handed over to another that was nice but not real efficient. When our food was delivered, my husband asked for hot sauce. It literally took five minutes with his food getting cold. We had to ask her a second time. Not that many people in there so I have no idea why it took so long for two little shots of hot sauce. She seemed annoyed.   The food. I had the short rib arepas.  Oh. My. Gracious. Decadent. It melted in your mouth. The flavors were amazing. Hubs had an omelet that he enjoyed post sauce delivery.   There did seem to be a lot of regulars. So it must be pretty consistent. If you're in the area, it's a delicious and unique spot for some dang good breakfast.",

That is going to be 14 people who were disappointed and will be telling their friends. So the day  before at 5:05pm, I called M & F about our large gathering that will take place the next day. I want to give them a heads-up so that they are not going to be surprised by such a large turn out during lunch. Made the reservation for 14 people at 11:30am with the manager.  Thought everyone is find.  But to be sure, during the date of the event, I called again at 11:15am, telling them that we are still coming so please keep our reservation.  I am told by the person (maybe hostess) that there were no such reservation.  But since I am on the phone, she will save us a table for 10 and a table for 4.  My groups starts to arrive and checked in.  Surprise, no reservations and no tables saved.  I asked the hostess what happened, explained that I made two phone calls to ensure our space, she blame the previous manager.  Saying that last night's manager did not relay that message to today's manager.  I said, ok, but I just called, she has no accountability.  So our entire group had to abandoned our plans and go elsewhere.  Really?  How many times do I have to call to make you aware of our intentions?  If you can't handle the simplicity of holding a reservation, how am I suppose to trust your staff with the complexity of preparing my meal?  WOW, such losers.",

I want to come back and try their breakfast as it looks scrumptious.   Four of us were wandering Downtown on a rainy/cold day and craved some warm drinks. We all decided to stop in and grab something togo! We ordered 4 small drinks that came to over $20 for all (and boy are they small).   My friend and I both ordered the Vanilla Honey Latte, my boyfriend ordered a Chai tea, and the last was a Coconut Milk Nutella Latte.   After waiting about 10 minutes, we received all four drinks. They messed up on the Chai tea and remade it. All of the other 3 coffees were hardly warm and were not even completely filled (I will say that my boyfriend loved his Chai Tea and it was extremely hot after they remade it)!   Unfortunately, after the Chai was incorrect we all silently kept to ourselves the opinion of each of our lukewarm coffees. It wasn't until we all got in the care and started talking about \"if we'd go back\" that we realized we all have the same complaint.   I just hope that this review reaches the store and they can guarantee HOT coffee to their guests!   Can't wait to try their grub tho!",

We ordered:  4/5 Beet Root Latte - Has organic powdered beet root, zester agave, espresso and foam. Our server said that the espresso will be extra. I said wait a minute, it's LISTED in the menu that it's included, why are you charging me more? She said she would ask the manager about it because I'm right, it shouldn't be an extra charge... She then came back that she's not going to charge me extra and will let Management know about the issue. We'll see if I ever go back and order it again, haha. She said she thought it wasn't too sweet. It has agave so I knew it would be. It was sweet but still pretty good. I couldn't taste the espresso at all so I asked for another shot. The server gave it to me without charging me. That was nice. I like to taste a bit of espresso in my lattes.  4/5 Iced Lavender Latte - Pretty good. Nice hint of lavender without being overwhelming. Still a bit on the sweet side.  4/5 Lomo Saltado - I asked for no added salt because this dish is full of soy sauce already and I've had this dish super salty at other places. It was delish. I kind of wished there was some rice to go along with the soy sauce and make it less salty. But, per request I asked for the yuca fries instead of the regular fries. I am a sucker for Yuca. Loved the sunny side up egg on top.  4/5 Empanada Sampler - Comes with short rib, chicken tinga, garlic shrimp, queso & spicy mushroom, and dipping sauces. I had to ask for chimichurri too, on the side. I saw that I was charged extra for that on my bill. That's fine but would have liked to know that before seeing it on the bill. I love chimichurri and everyone makes it different and I like to try it every place that offers them! This was a good one too.    All in all the food and drinks was good and the long-time server was pleasant. She smiled the whole way and said kind words, like I hope to see you back. If I'm ever in that area when they're open, I will!",

The decor is fun and totally hip with an industrial vibe!  My group (about 10 of us) had to wait for our table to be ready. This was fine since we arrived a bit early. While we were waiting, my friend was feeling light-headed and I suspected low blood sugar. I informed the hostess and asked for a sprite. She went to get it right away without hesitation! Now, THAT is wonderful customer service!  We were seated at a large table in the back. The server took our drink orders first and came back to get our entre orders.   The cold brew coffee was awesome (I added some stevia and almond milk)! Pretty sure I drank the coffee as quickly as possible! Lol  The plantain chips were very tasty! The chips had a nice crunch. They were served with black beans, green and red salsa. Definitely a unique dish. I would recommend adding additional chips to the dish (We had lots of beans leftover!).  I ordered the vegan empanada sampler. It did not disappoint! The texture was crispy/crunchy and flakey, with a warm filling. I enjoyed the soyrizo empanadas the most!  My boyfriend ordered the vegan hash. I had a  few bites, it was savory and filling! I loved the combination of peppers, spices, and potatoes.  The service was impeccable! The server was very attentive and the food came out fast. The server even took a few photos of our group!  I will definitely be back soon!",

This definitely fits the hipster coffee vibe that we've been seeing in Los Angeles for quite a while, and I don't mean that as a negative.   Decor-wise, I love the interior with its modern and clean look along with lots of Instagram-able items all over from its neon signage to the nice menus. Service for us was pretty on point and everything came out pretty timely. Let's talk food/drinks.   I got a cold brew. Saw some fantastic looking lattes but just wanted to opt for something more straightforward. No issues here - strong, smooth and not too overpowering.   I also got the Arepa Benny. Overall, I liked this quite a bit. The bread on the bottom was a corn cake which was fantastic. I loved the texture as a play on the usual Egg Benedict. Also loved the plantains it came with (wish we got a bit more!). The overall benny was good and tasty. I would love to see a bit more of a kick or the option for it as the flavor on it was overall pretty light. Otherwise, it was well-cooked. The overall meal was also under $40 for two which is solid.",

Nice roomy place and not crammed like most other places of similar style. I wish I can package that coffee and bring it back with me to NYC. We also got the fruit bowl that was a tad bit disappointing since the watermelon seem wilted and the fruited were cut into tiny dice. All in all a solid place for unique breakfast and waitstaff who don't rush you out.",

I'm factoring in that Vegas has a small up and coming trendy scene and that's why people love this place. GOOD- The cafe has a bunch of local Vegas hipsters hanging out and a really interesting selection of creative food and beverage items. Coffee drinks were great and clearly the highlight of this place. The menu had a lot of tasty sounding options. NOT GREAT- The prices were high for SMALL PORTIONS of food. The food itself was good but not stellar! Not for what you pay. My friend ordered more food cause she was still hungry after her \"appetizer sized\" breakfast.  Not great enough to warrant a revisit next time we are in town.",

I was initially introduced to it by a friend downtown, but I immediately fell in love with the quality, location, and staff.  I have tried a variety of things on the menu, but I always come back to my go to: tomato bisque with a croissant grilled cheese. It's not super large, but it is DELICIOUS. I also tried I believe there empanadas, and they were also extremely tasty. The loaded chorizo soup was disappointing as employees raved about it, but I found it small and not too loaded.   They also have some pretty amazing coffee (duh, it's a coffee place). I've never had a bad cup, and the one that I keep going back to is...grr...I forgot the name. It's like an entendido? Something like that. But it's made with condensed milk and espresso I believe, it's surprising smooth.  I mostly have sat at the bar and always get great service from the staff. Sometimes when they are busy and I sit at a table, service can be a little slow.  Overall though, great space, great experience, consistently delicious. Even better, they generally have super convenient free and available parking out front. Now THAT truly makes this an easy place to have a quick meeting.",

Lavender latte is delicious and the honey vanilla is like a warm horchata.  We got here at 10:00 but their kitchen doesn't open until 11, which is fine, just a little weird since we were planning on breakfast. It makes sense not to open it until later but it'd be smart to have the info up on yelp.  Another thing was I wish they carried soy milk. They only carry regular and almond milk, but I don't think almond milk sits as well with espresso as soy. Hopefully they bring it in if more people request it. Some servers were nicer than others when I mentioned it, if you know what I mean...",

I ate all my chocolate croissant- it was not dry or stale and seemed very fresh.",

We looked thru the photos and saw the beautiful presentation of the menu items and various lattes they have. We are so happy we tried Makers & Finders Coffee. They did not disappoint. First off easy street parking right in front. Can't say that about the strip.  We were seated right away and our waitress Jen came immediately with menus and water. We tried the La Paisa Arepa carne and Arepa Benny. Both so good and flavorful. Eggs were perfect and runny the way we like. The beef tender and moist. Wife had the Lavender infused Latte and I had regular pressed coffee. She loved the latte. Hints of Lavender and not over powering. The coffee smooth and strong. Not bitter. Just what we needed for morning after the casino. Oh yeah. Had cravings for French fries last night so we tried their crispy fries. Nicely seasoned and crispy. Great with the aioli sauce. Prices very reasonable for the quality of the food. Portions are very satisfying. Finally the service from Jen and her associates was exceptional. They came by several times during our stay to check on us and always with a smile. Very happy now. Will tell our friends and visit again.",

The beautiful girl at the hostel recommended this jem and I had to go back and thank her. (Even though I had already checked out!!) Per her recommendation I had the Latin hash and the lavender latte. (Lads don't worry, you can have a beer later if your manhood feels a bit tainted after uttering the words lavender and latte consecutively) I got to say she was right on the money. The hash was phenomenal and the coffee was beyond words. Cheers mates. If you're ever in Australia, ask for Chris, I'll get you some brew, but I must say it won't be as good as yours.",

I wish I could bring this place to Chicago because nothing compares to the quality they serve! I ended up stopping here twice on my trip, two days in a row, because I couldn't get enough of the lavender latte. They had such an amazing and expansive menu of coffee and espresso drinks, which from the ones I tried, were so unbelievably good. What really stood out to me was the consistency and quality of the drinks. Each one was made with a lot of care and attention to detail! I know I keep repeating myself, but every so often I'll sigh and reminisce about how wonderful the lavender latte was.  Aside from the drinks, the food was phenomenal. I loved the tinga and the arepas! Our waitress was lovely and very friendly. I really enjoyed everything about my experience here. I'm looking forward to returning next time I'm in Vegas!",

I tried the honey vanilla iced latte and my friend tried the lavender iced latte. I usually get lavender latte is wherever I go and even though mine was delicious I regretted not getting hers!   I did not know that they had such a big food menu. I thought it was just your typical coffee shop with maybe some pastries or small sandwiches but they actually have a lot of food. I am excited to try the empanadas as well as some of the other items that I saw On the menu. I will update my review once I try the food but the lavender latte was one of the best I've had! I recommend coming just for that if nothing else.   Also they're very close to a lot of vintage stores and a buffalo exchange so it's nice to walk around that area after lunch",

Everything about this place is not \"Las Vegas.\" It is a great escape from the horror I perceive to be LV. This coming from someone who was raised there, and fortunately escaped when I was just shy of adulthood.  Their coffee is excellent. Their sandwiches made with the freshest ingredients and healthy delicious. Their desserts, equally delish, in a decadent way. They definitely take pride in everything they did. Makers and Finders is located in the LV's Arts District. This coffeehouse is a sweet little escape in a crazy town.",

The overall vibe of the restaurant felt too dark and wannabe hipster to me.  It didn't feel very inviting and the staff didn't seem particularly thrilled that a bunch of us had come just for coffee, but after driving out of my way to get here, I didn't want to just leave either.  The coffee itself was good.  Pricey, but a unique drink.  I got the one with the coconut and the turmeric.  Worked quite well as a flavor combo together.  Service was really slow and it took forever to flag down staff.  They did seem particularly understaffed to be fair, but that's not really my fault.  I think one of the guys was apologetic about our wait and gave us a discount on our bill which was very sweet of him, but I definitely wouldn't be back.",

She went to management and asked, and they accommodated. Awesome. We sat down and ordered coffee first- I ordered a dirty chai tea latte with almond milk (that I later found out was A+). If you know me (and most morning people) you know I need coffee ASAP. About 30 minutes later we got our food still without our coffees... which was a bit underwhelming. I was hoping for coffee before food. Seems that the barista is (often) backed up. I ordered the Vegetarian Chilaquiles. They were different than the traditional chilaquiles, they were little crunchy tortilla chips with salsa verde.  They were REALLY tasty, though. Everyone enjoyed their food. Latin hash looked gorgeous, and the veggie burger had hash browns in it. Neato. Brunch Latin flare at its finest.",

We ordered the honey vanilla latte, lavender latte, and breakfast empanadas.   Honey vanilla latte: Lightly sweetened with hints of cinnamon and honey. If you like more coffee than sweet, this is a nice option.   Lavender latte: Syrup made in house daily!!!  Ayyyyyyeeee. It was sweetened just right and it didn't overpower the coffee at all.   NOW FOR THE SHINING STAR! Holy shit!! The empanadas. DAMNIT!!! This is what we waited 30 mins for. I was waiting on the car with the babes and the hubby went in and ordered. I text him, \"the hell is happening? Is the place being robbed?\" He said, \"they're making the empanadas to order.\"  I thought, damn, they aren't just THERE in a case? These things better be up there with AMAZING and THE SWEET BABY JESUS.   They were. Fuck. They were fried, crispy, with some type of orange deliciousness on them and filled with bacon, eggs, and potatoes. I was so sad that we only ordered one each. I almost ate the hubbies too, but realized he's driving us so better not.   If you can dine in, do so. Thirty minutes was a lot to wait for a to go order. Coffee was ready in 5 minutes.   Definitely want to go back and try the chipotle chicken empanada.",

For a regular size the price was a bit pricey, with all the bells and whistles included I can get something larger someplace else. I like the vibe of the place though, so I will come by again to try the Mexican latte!",

There are delectable things on the menu. The drink menu is also unique and made with high-quality ingredients. And the people here were totally chill.   I sat at the bar and got to watch the magic happen. I really loved my coconut turmeric latte ($5.50), which was unique and wonderfully balanced. It was rich but not too heavy and really woke me up.  This is such a charming, off the beaten path spot. You should definitely check it out.",

I was super annoyed at the fact that they weren't fast and efficient. That said the food was okay. If you want a better place go to PlubicUs.",

    "text": "After yelping for a brunch spot near downtown Las Vegas, I was stoked to try Finders & Makers. Good coffee + latin fusion brunch food? SOLD.  First of all, this restaurant is such a cute space. From the neon blue M + F behind the coffee bar to the colorful goat mural on the back wall, the aesthetic of this place is obviously well-curated and on point.  I came here on a Sunday morning and it was crowded enough that we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. There was also a bit of a mishap where a couple skipped a few places in line and was seated ahead of a few parties. I tried explaining the situation to the hostess, but she was pretty clueless and not super helpful. Also, the drinks we ordered came out at the same time as our entrees (bummer!). All in all, I had to subtract a star for their shaky service.   BUT, I still had a delightful brunch and the food and coffee were fun and unique! I quite enjoyed my arepa topped with shredded beef, black beans, sweet plantains, and a fried egg. My dining companion ordered the arepa eggs benedict which was also delicious. The menu contains a nice variety of traditional brunch dishes as well as Colombian dishes. They also have a stellar coffee menu. I enjoyed my lavender latte and was intrigued by the turmeric coconut milk latte (next time!). My dining companion ordered a matcha cocktail which was quite unique and refreshing.   Such a groovy spot! Can't wait to return next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

They offer beer, wine, coffee and cocktails. They even serve coffee cocktails! The service was attentive and friendly.   I love that they serve their breakfast menu later in the day for those who rise late. They have egg dishes, meat dishes, vegetarian and vegan dishes as well (which are clearly marked on the menu--thank you!).   I enjoyed the soyrizo brussel sprouts which came with plantain chips and I was happy with the large portion. It was delicious but I was wanting more vegetables instead of so much soyrizo. My friends were happy with the chicken tinga omelette and rajas arepa that they ordered. They also ordered the espresso martini which was too sweet for my liking but they loved it. I enjoyed the banana bread ale which was so delicious.   The bathrooms are used by both this restaurant and the neighbor bar Hop Nuts. Great location if you'd like to continue your day at local shops or bars.",

My daughter wanted just hash browns and since they didn't have this they were kind enough to make her crispy potatoes.   The wait was longer then usual and our food arrived before our coffees, which is unlike them.   Nonetheless, our breakfast was wonderful. The Vegan Hash is a must if your a plant based eater like myself.",

The mocha was fine but not memorable. The croissant was gummy in the middle.   But the thing that really got my attention was that I only got part of my change. The bill was $8.57 or something like that and the girl handed me only bills. I looked at my change then back at her. \"I think you forgot 40 cents or so.\" She then explained that she could \"totally give me my change\" but that they usually round their prices up or down to the nearest dollar.   Well that's weird.   If you're going to round to the nearest dollar than don't bother to tell me that the price was anything except your rounded price. I've never heard of any other place that does this and there was no sign describing their rather unusual policy.  The 43 cents doesn't matter. But clearly communicating to your customers...THAT matters. Especially when you do a really uncommon thing with their money. Then it REALLY matters. And on that front this place failed miserably.  Passable coffee, mediocre baked goods and very poor communication. Total Fail.",

It was definitely worth the price I got it for. In addition, I tried a bite of their chia seed pudding, and there was nothing off about the flavor, but it definitely needed to be a little colder than it was intended to be served. My only issue with this location compared to that of the Summerlin location was how long I waited between dishes my friends and I ordered. I'm assuming it has to do with it being the downtown location, so it could have been because it was busier than usual. Overall, the experience was good. I enjoyed the scenery of the Art District that was around this location.",

Actually, the people sitting next to me on both sides were working on their laptops and I have a feeling that they were probably there for a long time.    I ordered a lavender latte and it was very very delicious.  It was very large as well and was able to sustain me for the entirety of my meal.  I am quite excited to come back in a try another one of their specialty lattes.  The food was pretty good.  I really appreciate that they label menu items for dietary restrictions and that there were a lot of gluten free options.  The only problem I had was that I ordered avocado with my Latin Hash and didn't get any.  I told my bartender and she was more than willing to get me some but I thought it was good without it.

We were greeted as we walked through the door and shown to a table/given menus. The atmosphere is really cool, there's a little study spot which people were making the most of near the bar, pretty tile, neon lights and a great open space. The tables are a little close together but as it wasn't too busy, we had space either side. Israel was our server and he was very friendly and always came over with a smile. There were a LOT of options for coffee and they all looked so good it was hard to decide, but we went for the cortado and cortadito - mine the smaller one - and it was SO good! The food menu was again, extensive and there was so much - too much even - to choose from. Thankfully they had a screen near the bar with images of all their dishes and drinks that it became easier when you could see it all. We went for the breakfast croissant and the arepa benny.  When they both came, the benny looked impressive and the croissant a little measly, especially with no little side salad or even garnish, but the croissant was delicious! They didn't skimp on the bacon and the orange sauce it came with was so good we asked for a little more! The benny on the other hand was disappointing! The poached egg was runny but when I broke into it, a whole lot of water came out and made everything a little soggy. There was a good amount of meat but it wasn't seasoned and as such, was pretty tasteless. The hollandaise also pretty tasteless. Such a shame because I was craving a benny before arriving but didn't care to finish this one. M & F really seem to have their strengths along with the odd weakness, so I would try something else next time and either way, come back for the coffee!",

So does this mean if you owe them .50 do they undercharged you so you don't give them coins or are they just scamming the public and taking all the extra change in putting it in the tip jar   Very poor way of doing business they should post it then you can give the exact change and they can stick it where ever they want lol  There are a few other places to have coffee in this mall I suggest going anywhere else.",

It comes with all five of their different flavored empanadas with 3 different sauces. I don't know what it was but the orange sauce was amazing!

    "text": "Wow.  I was so disappointed.  It started off with a careless, rushed, and bad server.  She ran to tables us including.  Asking people if they are ready to order within seconds of sitting down.  No back and forth.  No suggestive-selling.  No emotion.  Just give me the order so I can run away.  Now if she is overworked, underpaid, or the restaurant is understaffed - fine.  But if that's just the way she is - then she either needs to go or this is just not the job for her.   My order:   I ordered salmon toast.  This is such a simple and delicate thing.  It is easily prepared and hard to mess up.  The bread it was served on was kind of like wonder bread.  There was nothing \"toasty\" about it. It was soft and gooey and simply too thick for the little amount of salmon and garnish.  The plantain chips it came with were - half hard as a rock and half were nice and crunchy.   I was very disappointed because I consider makers and finders one of the few places in Las Vegas where locals can enjoy a hip, cool, and delicious environment in downtown.  Public US is where I'll be going next time. I've had great experiences at M&F but this one wasn't it.  While our downtown is being renovated and it's growing it would be nice to see this place continue to flourish and not disappear.  Also, I asked for ground pepper for my toast.  A gentleman brought me a pepper shaker.  Get it together guys.",

This is a fairly pricey restaurant and while some items (such as my foamy latte was great), I expected a far better entree.

It was fantastic! I'm definitely going to try making my own lavender simple syrup for homemade lavender lattes. If they are half as good, I'll be happy.  I also suddenly got hungry and ordered their Arepa Benny. One of the points of getting Eggs Benedict to me is for the Hollandaise. In this case, the mother sauce is replaced with Chimichurri and the English muffins are replaced with arepas. Eggs were perfectly poached. Bloody brilliant!

When I unfolded my napkin, I noticed that there was a piece of chewed up gum stuck between the folds. It was quite revolting. The server promptly replaced it with a stack of new napkins. I highly doubt that a patron would reach over to another table and placed the gum in the napkin. More than likely, the patron probably placed the gum in one of the extra napkins that was given to him/her and the server thought the napkins were unused and redistributed them. Not a hygienic practice.    We ordered the Breakfast Bagel, Arepa Benny, and an Iced Chai Latte. The Breakfast Bagel did not look like the ones I've seen in the pictures; thin slice of egg, a smudge of avocado spread, few specks of bacon, and invisible cheese on a badly burnt bagel. It was flat in both appearance and taste.  The inside of the bagel halves was so burnt, I couldn't eat it. My companion and I were going to share the dishes. She was too polite to return the food so she ate the burnt bagel. The egg on the Benny was perfectly cooked but the arepa was so dry it tasted like cardboard. The $4.50 12oz Chai Latte with 1/3 ice tasted like a diluted horchata. I tasted way better horchata at Sweet Tomato.   Maybe it was just a bad day. I am willing to give it another try but definitely not on a Sunday.",

We ordered large iced lavender infused lattes, Mexican spiced lattes, and I ordered honey vanilla latte (after having spent ten minutes between that and the Nutella latte). The lavender kicks in after a while, so give it a while.   For food, we ordered the la paisa arepas and the ripened mango arepas (which were both okay). Lastly, we ordered two arepa benny's (nickname for benedict), which is probably the best thing. You will also feel full with this dish, whereas the other two might leave you still wanting more. The thin crispy fries with the aioli were good and I would get them again for $5.  When dining for lunch, several people there ate alone with their drinks and MacBook's. Couches available to hangout inside, as well as outdoor seating (choose wisely, like on a warm-not-so-hot day!).",

I sometimes will bring my dogs and sit at the tables out front. The mexican and caramel lattes are two wonderful options, and my favorite food items are the arepa benny or la paisa. Everything is made with care here, just as it is all consistently excellent. Parking on the street isn't so difficult depending in the time, but it is worth it any time to steal away from the noise of the city and enjoy a relaxing drink.",

Surrounded by businesses like Vegas-style second-hand shops and art collectives, it is a great place to stop in for a cup of coffee, chai, breakfast or brunch.   The service was excellent.  We sat outside, as it was a perfect fall day, and were well attended to.  My husband is a coffee drinker and said that it was delicious.  I enjoy chai, since they offer the option of lavender in some of the other drinks, I asked for it in my drink.  It was delicious!  They will make your drinks to-go, if you ask.   The food was great.  It was a fun mix of American and Latin flavors.  All of the food is fresh.  I had chilaquiles.  They had a lot of sauce on them, but the flavors were right on.   Definitely stop in if you are in the area and enjoy being just far enough off the strip to relax a little bit.",

They do have a bar, but I hate high top chairs. Their sofas were full, and the chairs at their community table aren't the most comfortable. Sometimes I sit outside, but usually it takes longer to be served.   My server came to the table and asked \"How many are with you?\" I wasn't properly greeted, and then I was told I needed to move. I tried to explain why I chose the table, but he said \"Yeah, but I need these 2 open. Can't really have a party of 1 here.\" I'm a local freelance writer. I enjoy coming here to write, and have even conducted interviews on their patio. I discovered M&F over a year ago, and have frequented the restaurant 2-3 times a month ever since. After this experience I will not be returning. I used to see it as a gem in downtown, but I feel everyone should know, the food is good, but the service level is not only lacking, but also incredibly inconsistent. Spend your money elsewhere.",

The service is great except for a minor hiccup on placing our food orders.   The iced Mexican Spice Latte is fantastic--rich, slightly sweet and had the right amount of spice. My Latin Hash and fries is good too, but I envied my sister's arepa benny more. The real standout was espresso flan--a decadent dessert with great flavors. Overall, M&F's is a great place for a casual meet up for coffee and food.",

    "text": "Wanted to stop somewhere for breakfast/brunch on the way to the outlets, and picked this place off of yelp. Best decision.   This place hasn't been open 6 months yet, but it's definitely an up and comer. To start off the hubby and I got the two unique lattes from their menu. The Mexican spice latte had mocha, cloves, and I think some other light spices in it. It was the perfect amount of sweetness (barely there letting the flavors shine), and and was wonderfully made (not too hot and delicious creamy foam). The lavender infused latte was a little sweeter, and had just enough lavender to titillate; it was wonderfully made as well.  For food we got the Arepa Benny and the Rajas Arepa. I'd never encountered an arepa before, but it's a little cornmeal patty with a lovely flavor and texture. Both dishes took a little longer than I expected to come out, but they were so worth it! The arepa Benny was similar to an eggs benedict, but with coffee rubbed beef instead of ham and the arepa instead of an English muffin. The hubby is a fan of eggs benedict, and said it was the best he'd ever had. The Rajas arepa was a mound of sauteed peppers and onions on top of an arepa, drizzled with an amazing avocado cream sauce; absolutely recommended for other vegetarians out there! Both dishes were served with long sliced plantain chips.  There was one mistake on a dish, and the owner came out to talk to us and gave us the most amazingly soft and fresh jam filled croissant (they get them from a bed and breakfast nearby I believe) to apologize while they remade the dish. He was very nice.  Will definitely be back! Want to try some of the tasty looking empanadas I saw a person at the table next to us eating.",

You get shredded meat, plantains, and rice, and I ordered eggs on the side. SO FILLING! MUCH PROTEIN! Also, service was great and the place is modern and cute.

And actually....I'm ok with that. In fact, I kind of feel like my midlife-mom status goes up a couple \"cool\" points when I walk in the door. Like, 'good for you lace'...'go get your coffee face on'.  They are serious about the pour, flavor, and craft...it definitely ain't the norm. What I love is seeing all sorts of random folks in here: business suit types, yoga pants moms, and the college kids making us put ourselves in check...  What I've learned is to tell the staff what I like usually and then tell me what I should get based off their recommendations. They put a mean Latin twist on simple coffees, teas, and of course their bomb ass food!  So I let them \"Make\" me try something new...and I usually \"Find\" out it's awesome! Oh yeah, that's how it should be. Thanks for keeping me cool Maker's N Finders. You simply rock.",

This stylish and vibrant coffee bar introduces both comfort and amenity that smoothly yells, \"Hello\" to those who pass around Las Vegas' still-developing Arts District.  Parking, however, may be quite a challenge. But if you ever do find that perfect spot, get yourself over there right away and treat yourself nicely for finding that parking spot. And hey, let I remind you again that this is a coffee bar. So, if you decide to come by during a Summer's day, and you want to get something iced? Well, you will not be disappointed. Serving with the right temperature and a little sweetness from their lattes, you're in for a smooth and comfortable delight. Trust me on this one because of the service there?... Oh, Ladies and Gents, THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT. QUICK, HELPFUL, PROPER, IT MUST BE MENTIONED WITH PRAISE.   Now, did I mention that they deserve Gluten-free breakfast and brunches here?   Oh yes.  My order: Arepa Benny Breakfast, Gluten Free Golden poached eggs, coffee rubbed beef, grilled tomatoes, salsa verde Hollandaise.  Verdict: AMAZING.   (And there is one more dish I'd truly recommend. The \"Grilled Chicken Arepas\". Trust me. You are welcome.)  Onto dessert: The Espresso Flan. You read me, folks. Flan poured with a shot of espresso, topped with whipped cream and strawberries.  Verdict: If you have a company... PLEASE DO YOUR BEST TO SHARE. I know I didn't want to. I WANTED IT ALL FOR MYSELF BECAUSE IT'S. THAT. DAMN. Good.   But of course, there are a plenty number of other delicious entrees and desserts worth exploring on their menu. Just don't forget that latte on the side because this restaurant has the spirit and heart to serve with great, excellent service (Also literally on your latte, too, if you ever decide on \"hot\"). It is a coffee bar after all. A fine, classy one.  So happy to find this place. You will be, too.  -AC",

They said whatever makes us comfortable. Can wait to go back for more beermosas",

    "text": "I want to love this place soo badly. It has vegan options, is in a great location, they deliver to Hop Nuts (more below), they focus on good coffee & Latin food, so we're all onboard for that. I read about the owner in the Weekly & his whole agenda is AWESOME. So much respect.  The problem is that in practice, everything is just so disappointing. All of the exciting coffee drinks generally aren't vegan friendly. I wanted a legit vegan cortadito, but basically ended up with just espresso with blah almond milk or something. I have that at home everyday, so nothing special there. Can't you buy some coconut condensed milk/evaporated milk, etc? I guess I could've tried a hippie lavender flavor, but I wanted something, yanno, Cuban.  The vegan empanadas were a giant letdown, because to put it simply, eggroll-ish wrappers are not fr*cking empanada dough. Most peeps won't know the difference, but we did. The fillings were very alright. Sigh. How can you mess up empanadas? The vegan chorizo tasted like just bell peppers. No me gusta.  Ordering was a semi-disaster. I ordered online, where it stated they closed at a different time than their online ordering. We were having a drink at the time at Hops Nuts, so I saw they were still open & kinda busy...so we ordered. I got a call from someone in a remote location saying they were closed, lol, okay...We went inside where they said we had to order through Hops Nuts. Ok. No big deal, I guess (we wasted 20min), but fix your Yelp page & online ordering hours because there's a discrepancy in those. Had to call & get a refund because I already paid online. Annoying.  Fast forward to after we ordered through Hops Nuts: we get presented a receipt, ummm...my card is with the bartender, as we have a tab going. Waitress looks put out having to get that. She proceeds to try & flirt with my man not knowing I'm the one paying (and I'm a cocktail waitress, lol!) so yeah, enjoy your pity $2. My advice when waiting on couples, be equally as friendly to the girl.",

He had come to this cafe once prior and recommended that I try it myself since it was located in close proximity to my school. He ordered me a beef melt sandwich and Nutella latte. The beef melt came with shredded beef, caramelized onions, and peppers on top of a toasted baguette topped with mozzarella cheese and plantain chips on the side. The melt was loaded with flavor and so delicious to eat. I only wish there was more of it. For $9.50, the portion was pretty small. The Nutella latte was very bland. I wish there was more of the Nutella flavor. It tasted more like chocolate milk than anything. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his latte when he dined in, so Im going to blame it on the to-go order. I definitely want to come back and dine here one day!",

Breakfast was amazing, can't remember exactly what I ordered but I remember it had eggs and I loved it.. But what I do remember perfectly is the empanadas.  The empanadas were to die for, we tried both the chicken and the mushroom.. In my opinion, the mushroom was better but both are just scrumptious.  And don't get me started on the coffee.. I literally ordered my second cup while I was still drinking my first, that's how good it was. I tried both honey cinnamon latte and the lavender latte.. Both delicousssss but I preferred the honey latte (a little less sweet).",

Upon entering you get a really nice laid back vibe. With people laughing and talking and blaring Latin Music. This place is a restaurant/coffee bar which I find perfectly convenient. The Decor is hipster mixed with vintage. They have a decent sized menu with lots of new things (for me) to try. I had the Smoked Salmon Benny, and my husband had the Bandeja Paisa. Both were really good. We didn't try the coffee but definitely will next go round. We love downtown and if you haven't been, you should definitely visit!",

It was really nice to have time to discuss menu options with our server and have it feel like more of a conversation than a brief data collection. Really great service!  The place is very relaxed and has a nice balanced atmosphere that's alive, but managed well by keeping tables spaced out enough to avoid it feel like crowded. As a result we really felt welcome and enjoyed our food and just being in the space. The sound levels are a little above average, which meant leaning in a little to make sure we could clearly hear each other at our table, but it wasn't loud enough for this to be a problem.   Coffee, tea, water... were all amazingly good here.  The food was delicious and just the right portion size. Portion sizes here are about average for the US, which I find good. More is not necessarily better.   It was tempting to go back here two days in a row but we decided to try somewhere else. Mistake! We should just have come back again!   Parking around here is plentiful. No problems there. The area has a few other cafes and bars too, but otherwise appears kinda run down. Don't let that put you off, just like M&F proves, there are some gems in this area.",

Parking is quite hard to find in this part of town however once you do find a space and come into the restaurant you will be blown away. This is absolutely a good place to go brunching with your family or after a night at the tables or club. The staff was very friendly, however they weren't as attentive as we wish there were.  We had the pull pork egg Benedict was perfection, which also came with a side of plantain.  I also had the pull pork sandwich which was delicious as well.

I can't give the fifth star just yet because of their service. They are friendly when you finally get their attention, but super slow. It took a full 15 minutes for someone to even come over and ask if I needed anything. I feel like Makers and Finders has a slight identity crisis. They want to be a hip coffee shop, but they also want to be a Latin restaurant. This could totally happen, but maybe a different way of ordering. Maybe take a note from Public Us? You can have people stand in line and order, then give them a number and have waiters or waitresses bring it to you. Simple and easy.  Don't get me wrong this place is amazing for coffee! My favorites are the Cuban coffee or the Salted Caramel latte. As far as food goes you can't go wrong. They do have a different menu for brunch during the weekend that kicks ass. On my most recent visit I was a bit disappointed in the food. I tried the veggie bagel. It comes with dill cream cheese, avocado (like 4 little slices), thick cut pieces of tomato all on a giant half toasted/have burnt bagel. With a few tweeks it would have been better.  Will I be back? Yes. Will I make sure I have plenty of time? Yes. Will I just order coffee? Probably!!",

The coffee isn't free refill. They do charge you for another cup so that's a great heads up to know or be aware of. The place itself is super quaint and loved everything about it!",

You made my life worth living for And if I had to live my life over again, dear I'd spend each and every moment with you...   You're once Twice Three times a lady And I love you\"  And so it goes for me with M&F... I really wanted to have a love affair with this restaurant, but I left heartbroken... Again!  Originally visited the restaurant a few months back for breakfast on a Saturday. The food was good, but service was awful! If you've ever been to a restaurant where there seems to be a lot of people hustling, but no one getting anything accomplished then you've been to M&F. Again, the food was good... but service awful! This is Las Vegas, and I can't understand for the life of me how such a service-focused population let's a restaurant slide like they do here.   So with another Saturday on the calendar, decided that maybe the first time was a fluke (We all have bad days, right?) Wrong! The second time was worse than the first...  While there were three empty tables, the hostess informs that there will be a 20-30 minute wait. For what I'm not certain? No problem... they have what looks like an awesome coffee bar. All the usual suspects are present, and few new ones. Order a Cuban Espresso and a Lavender Latte. Mr Barista is Mr Poopy Pants and informs that he can only take our order/serve us at the ToGo area... Huh? He fails to deliver the drinks by the time we're seated (10-15 minutes). Again, huh?  We're seated and no one comes over for 5-minutes. Not a crime, but waitress is going to other tables... What? She finally comes over and we order... Then I'm not certain what happens to our order, but it takes nearly 40-minutes to get our food. We go to the restroom and notice all kinds of orders stacked up waiting to be run to the tables, but no one is doing anything it seems.  The food was good... Not great. The service terrible. Oh Lionel... We're not gonna get to the third time as we vow never, never, never to return!  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? No Return? No Advocate? No, No, No!!!",

They're empanadas are ok, though the portions are small and I feel could be better. They're lattes are amazing! Their coffee is strong and great quality. The presentation are gorgeous too. On my latest visit I had the coconut turmeric latte. Though small, it was tasty, strong, and worth it. The consistency of the latte and balance was perfect. Good job baristas   They have a happy hour where the drinks are $1 off. The inside is clean and there's interesting art to admire while you're there. The staff are friendly and accommodating.  Great place to hang out with friends or study. Prices are fair for what you get.   Opt for this place rather than the usual chain coffee shops. You'll get something much better for about the same price.",

My most recent visit will most likely be my last.  I love supporting small businesses. Especially when it's comida Latina.  This visit is based on my overall experience and food. But what did it for me was the food I ordered for my daughters. Aside from there fruit plate, I ordered them chicken fingers. I started cutting the pieces to bite sizes for my girls. After cutting the first piece and started on the second, as soon as I cut into it all you could see is pink super under cooked chicken!  whyyy..... this not only messed up my appetite but it messed with what my daughters were going to eat.  How could someone be so careless to not fully cook a plate for kids!? That's what really bothered me. The carelessness of it all.  Our waitress apologized and was nice but that was it. No hey I'm sorry what else can we offer your kids..? Can we make this right ?   To the owner or management, making things right makes a huge difference to keep you customers.  Sorry but I can no longer recommend this place.",

I saw Makers & Finders walked over and inside. I quickly asked for the restroom and bolted for it. I could have just left after that but the staff was nice so I decided to order something.  I got a Matcha shot. The strongest and greenest Matcha shot I have had in awhile. Matcha is an acquired taste and I've been drinking coffee and consuming Matcha as ice cream over at Maiko. So I did what any rational caffeine addict does and added so much sugar to the Matcha. Got it to go, brought it home and added almond milk.   The Matcha shot was made right and if I find myself near-by I will try some coffee and maybe a snack at Makers & Finders.",

We had the Bacon and Brussels skillet and the Arepa Benny.   The Arepa Benny did not appear to be made to order. It consisted of scoops of marinated pork on top of a slightly soggy arepa. The yolks of the poached eggs had congealed, suggesting either that the dish had sat out, or that the eggs were over cooked. Besides the preparation, flavors were otherwise good---I could see this fish being great on a good day.  The bacon and Brussels sprouts skillet had very little bacon, but the sprouts were well cooked and the sauces were good.   SERVICE/CLEANLINESS: A few service issues: we asked for the eggs on the skillet to be poached, and when the bill came they had added a $1.00 surcharge for poaching. Not a big deal money-wise, but I thought it was super petty---both because they didn't mention it, and because it doesn't cost more to poach an egg instead of scramble it. Also, the bathrooms were super dirty (at 4 pm on a Friday).",

They feature new menu items too, and prices are quite affordable in ratio to the portions served. On warmer temps enjoy sitting outside to soak up the downtown atmosphere.

I would say it's a trendy place, but I'll admit; I was only there for about 15 minutes max. I can say that I literally paid $7 for a latte, including tip. Way too expensive. Kind of mad at myself for doing it. The atmosphere in this place is okay, not phenomenal. Maybe, the price has something to do with the location. It's in the Arts District, which is pretty cool, but again not phenomenal. So who knows if I'll be back. Probably won't make a special trip.",

I thought was going to find the place busy but I was glad that we were sat right away. Took a look at the menu and everything sounded exciting and appealing to us. After a few minutes, we ordered the Arepa Benny (Breakfast Menu) and La Paisa Arepa (Lunch Menu), also two drinks, the Caipirinha and their Bloody Mary. Food came decently fast. Both dishes were delicious, I would say the Arepa Benny was quite special. Also portions were perfect. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because both drinks were on the strong side, maybe not too enjoyable for breakfast time. Our waitress was a really nice one!",

Chicken tinga Chilaquiles has so many layers of flavors, spicy chicken,  freshness and tinny salsa verde, crunchiness of the chips with blacks beans and sour cream. All the flavors marinated so well together. The only problem was the chips got soggy very quickly, you ended eating big lumps of them. Arepa benny with short ribs was their version of eggs Benedict.  Short ribs was very  tender and top with a poached egg, and the base was the corn cake. What a delicious combination.",

All so equally delicious in their own way! If you're craving something sweet give the tres leches waffle a try and don't forget to spread the coconut cream and blueberries. If you're looking for something savory order the chilaquiles with short ribs, the taste is truly flavorful. Also the empanadas were enjoyable as well. The texture was light and fluffy, and tasty with the filling and sauce.   Besides the dishes, the service was great as well. Our waitress was friendly and our food got to us quickly. No complaints and can't wait to come back again!",

I tried the avocado toast and also a nice honey vanilla latte. Both hit the spot. The tomatoes and spices on the toast provided a surprising tanginess that was complemented by the gentle creaminess of the poached egg. Nicely done! Makers & Finders is located in a great spot on Main St - smack dab in the middle of some awesome antique shops. So it's perfect for wandering around, stopping by for a cuppa, and then wandering some more.",

    "text": "Located in the Las Vegas arts district, we had to take a Lyft to get here, however this area is getting a bit of a revitalization and is worth checking out. Getting decent coffee in Vegas isn't difficult, but the lack of 3rd wave coffee shops on the strip motivated us to make the trek.  They are Latin cuisine centered so don't expect to find your standard breakfast/lunch items, it will have an unique twist to it such as churro or tres leches waffles. They have a nice choice of drip coffees, they are most famous for their lavender and Mexican chocolate lattes. This is a popular brunch spot so there might be a bit of a wait, our wait wasn't too bad because we caught the tail end of the brunch rush.  I tried the lavender latte and I actually liked it! I usually stay away from it because sometimes it can taste a bit like soap, however their house made syrup is delicate without being heady. I got the honey vanilla latte which was alright. I wasn't in the mood for sweets that morning, next time I would like to try the Mexican chocolate latte.  We ate family style which was a bit difficult since their tables are so tiny, but everything I ate was tasty. The food comes out quickly even though this place is packed and it is well made. I liked their chilaquiles; it comes with salsa verde instead of the usual red sauce and you can add more protein on top (extra charge). I got chicken tinga as a topping which was tasty and opted to omit the beans since they make me toot.   We foolhardily decided to walk back to the strip even though we were over 1 1/2 miles away from our hotel and it was in the triple digits. Someone (ahem, not me) wanted to meet their 15,000 steps/day goal so I was coerced; it was a bad bad idea. It was a desolate and sketchy walk, I would not recommend it anyone, not even in cool weather. Point of the story is, come out here for good food and coffee but don't even think about trying to walk back!",

The pour over coffee (Columbian) was smooth, flavorful and wonderfully nuanced.  On a negative note, staff seems to forget about patrons (coffee took over 15 minutes over time proffered and had to remind to boot). Also, in a 1/3 full Monday morning, was asked to pay immediately before finishing said coffee. Would have gotten another order but was put off by the abruptness of the check. Less in the register for what is otherwise an outstanding place in Las Vegas.",

Food and coffee were good (I had the eggs Benedict served on a corn cake), but service was slow, and they got my order wrong the first time, and I had to wait even longer to get the right order.

    "text": "Food: I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because we had previously seen their regular menu and had anticipated ordering from it. We came on a Sunday so we ended up trying out their brunch. The menu wasn't as extensive and for some reason I wasn't really feeling anything on the menu. My fiance was pretty set on ordering the Arepa Benny and Lavender Latte, so I opted for the Latin Poutine. The Arepa Benny, which is pretty popular according to many of the reviews, was pretty good, but the meat lacked flavor and the highlight of the dish was the arepa. My poutine was good, simple, and flavorful, but not as filling as I thought it would be. My favorite item that we ordered was the Lavender Latte. It wasn't too sweet or too heavy, but a perfect blend of cream and just a hint of that floral lavender taste.   Environment/Ambiance: Definitely a modern hipster joint. There's a good amount of seating inside as well as outdoor lounge seating. From the outside I would have guessed it was a regular coffee shop. I really like the concept which I would guess is a hipster/Latin/coffee shop feel. It's very clean and minimal, although I wouldn't recommend this place for a large group.   Service: Service was prompt, but I must say it was forgettable. It got pretty busy when we arrived, so we rarely saw our server.   Tips: I think I may wanna come back on a different day other than their Sunday Brunch. If I ever come back, I definitely want that Lavender Latte again.",

I ordered the chicken sandwich expecting a filling meal, and was very disappointed to have two small crostini type sandwiches with very little meat. It didn't come with the avocado cream listed on the menu as well. To top it off, I ordered an Arnold Palmer, and I got a super sweet orange juice concoction that they charged me $5 for. We waited more than 20 minutes to get our check back as well. I am just very disappointed in a place that has high reviews here on yelp since my experience was not good.

A delicious skillet with a mix of potatoes, shredded beef, cheese, and peppers. I recommend adding the avocado and bacon because it just makes it that much more delicious. You guys I could eat this every day for breakfast it's so good I'm going to have dreams about. For dessert I got the tres leches waffles, let me tell you these were the most delicious waffles I've ever had! It's like Jesus came down from heaven and made them himself! I didn't find much flavor in the tres leches part of it but I'm not even mad they were so good! The coffee bar is so cool too I love the decor. Service is 5 stars, our server was sweet and on top of it, then someone came over to ask about our experience maybe the owner but that's a wonderful touch! I'll be back to try some more things!  P.s. I love that they give your table a water jug so you can pour yourself water when you run out! Even the best restaurants forget to fill your water sometimes so this takes care of that no matter how busy they are.",

The decor is your typical minimal, hipster-esque  Service: friendly but not very prompt. Our lattes took a while to go out as well as the food. They leave a water at the table so you can refill your own glasses.   Drinks: we got the lavender latte and matcha latte were so good! I liked that they had the choice of regular milk, coconut, or almond milk. I chose almond milk. My only gripe is how long it took to get out. Instead of a nice and hot latte, it was rather a luke warm that did not warm me up at all (it's chilly inside)  Food: I got the empanada platter with shrimp and mushroom. The empanadas themselves were amazing! It was almost as if it made from a puff pastry. Super flaky and delicate and delicious :) it also came with beans and rice and a small (I mean like 5 leaves) salad. All of which were delightful and flavorful. It also had a side of salsa which was perfectly spicy, tomatoey, etc and I asked for a side of cheese. My friend ordered the egg white chorizo kale dish. She said she could've made it at home, as it was rather bland and a simple dish. Butttt I think she should've just gotten a different dish. Because I absolutely loved my dish.  All in all, I am glad I tried this place but with the hassle of the parking and stuff, it might be a while before I come back! It was reallly good tho!!",

Some quick Googling led us to Makers & Finders and it was just what we wanted: a taste of the rest of the Vegas world -- and a delicious taste at that. Service was beyond wonderful, the cafe con leche was expertly prepared with just the right amount of sweetness, and the arepas con queso hit the spot. I'm bummed that we weren't able to visit again before the end of our trip to try some of the rest of the menu, but I'm sure it's nothing less than spectacular! Stop here for a bite and then go antiquing around the neighborhood for an easygoing day that shows the color of the city without drowning you in it.",

I mean, where else can you try coconut and turmeric with your coffee? Yes we tried it, and yes it was delicious. I also tried the lavender coffee which had some dried lavender bits on top. Strong, house-made syrup - not too sweet. It was very aesthetically appealing, BUT I really didn't want to know how those little dried bits tasted tasted.   Tres Leches Waffle. Chorizo Omelette.   Yup - both delicious. The whipped cream had tiny little coconut shreds in it! My only (very mild) complaint was that the omelette was somewhat oily, BUT that's to be expected if you're gonna eat chorizo. The omelette even comes with plantain chips! Mmm.",

From coffee to happy hour all the way through dinner this place does it all.  And the crafted teas and coffees are my favorite in town!!  Did I mention the food yet?  Nope.  Please hold-I will!!  My newest addiction is a London Fog.  Lovely Earl Gray tea infused with lavender, sweetened with vanilla syrup and steamed milk (I get almond milk).  It is warm, refreshing and just sweet enough to satisfy my dessert craving.  My coworker gets the turmeric coconut latte.  Espresso, milk, and cinnamon give this drink a healthy delicious balance.  Like I said.  We are big fans   Food.  I promised I'd get to this.  What we have had so far we love with the exception of one.    Avocado toast- nothing super special about it.  It's a solid choice to share with someone.  Some cracked black pepper on top would be a mice addition.  S&p available on request....not on the tables. Avocado Relleno-Love this!  Avocados filled with Greek yogurt tuna salad, sprinkled with capers and a halved grape.  I want more grapes on this!   Vegan Maduro \"burger\" black bean chipotle patty with mushrooms and salsa verde-this part was flavorful but I feel like something creamy needs to be added.  I wanted to try this because instead of a bun it's served on a plantain.  The plantain however was plain and dry.  I was hoping it would add a bit of sweetness to the sandwich.   Darn.   La Paisa Arepas-  sooo good!  Meat, sweet plantain.  This was my coworkers so I don't remember everything on it but I tried a bite and I will order in the future.  Bandeja paisa-  so much food!  But so good.  Skirt steak, egg, sweet plantain, avocado, chicharone with rice and black beans. Enough to share with someone!   Vegan arepas- I think that's the title.  Arepas with mushrooms, asparagus and other veggies I'm blanking on, lol.  Served with beans and rice and avocado.  Yum yum yum.  Wish that's what I ordered again today!  Love the atmosphere here as well.  Very laid back.  Great for a one on one business lunch as well.",

Inspire Cafe is good, but the hours are too irregular and the cafe seems like more of an afterthought compared to that shady club upstairs. Publicus   has that comfortable level of grittiness in its location, but the place is WAY too pricey for what is basically Starbucks fare and the look of the place is too institutional to be really comfortable.Advantage? Makers and Finders! Granted, The Beat was on a main drag of a popular area good for people watching, and the neighborhood is what i refer to as \"Hipster Row\". Lots of laptop toting, Urban Outfitter loving, startup company tablet junkies. Still, its a mellow crowd overall. I've always intended to have just have coffee and end up getting a small meal. The truffle fries are nothing short of divine. The coffee is always good, home-ground, and served by always chatty and personable waiters. I've never tried any of the tea beforehand, but I'm sure its wonderful.  I would easily recommend this place.",

It was balanced and really well made.   Loaded chorizo soup had good amount of spice from the chorizo and had potato and kale. It was a simple and solid soup, but at least something not standard. I'm in a soup mood and tired of chicken noodle being the only option everywhere.  Arepa benny I thought was great! It makes a lot of sense to use the arepa for this type of preparation as it sops up hollandaise well. I will order this again - and soon!   Carne mechada empanada was good as far as empanadas go.  I enjoyed the aji sauce on them, though the roasted potatoes and tomato accompaniment was a bit salty.  We also got the elvis press for dessert. It's a decent crossaint rich sandwich, but nothing you couldn't whip up easily at home. It works as a sweet option for a snack, but I dont know if I would call this \"dessert\". I love having nice beverages with something cakey. If they would fill the dessert category with patisserie items, this could be an even better place.   I like the easy going flow of this place. It's brand new so there's I'm sure some hiccups and a groove they need to get into, but the people are enthusiastic and friendly about what they serve which is the step in the right direction.   I will be back soon with the fiance. It's in a convenient spot near our cigar spot.",

From their decorations, to the environment, the coffee they craft and serve, to their carne desmechada!!! (Not sure what this was, but order it, you won't regret it).  It's a coffee house that care about the quality of their coffee and tea, they offer multiple brewing methods that add to the experience of a coffee junkie! Their cold brew coffee is simply on point, no sugar or cream needed. Natasha (wife) ordered an iced lavender latte; a little out of the box for me, but this drink was seriously delicious!  The environment is chill and very welcoming.   But wait, they serve Mexican comfort dishes!! Shrimp ceviche, little empanadas with perfectly marinated shredded beef in them, even smoked salmon bagels ( a must try).

Sometimes I even consider leaving work early just so I can go grab my favorite Honey Vanilla Latte before they close.  Actually, I'm considering doing that right now which is why I'm posting this review, because bae was on my mind.  Anyway.  Their bagels are amazing, I've had the lox and sprouts bagel, both are incredible choices and you can't go wrong.  The prices are great, the staff is friendly and there's an outdoor patio for you and your dog to sit (my dog usually gets all tangled up in the tables so I usually don't bring him often).  I recommend this place to anyone in the downtown area.",

Normally, I wouldn't update a poor review if my impression changed--I'd just leave subsequent reviews. However, given how consistently great my experience has been there and that I heard the company had a VM issue with its VM vendor, I feel an edited review is appropriate.  Let me share my three most important impression that keep me coming back. 1. The food here is awesome!  This coffee shop rivals most restaurants in town with their food menu.  The Latin-inspired menu is creative and delicious.  One of my favorites is the Beef Melt with mixed peppers, caramelized onions, and mozzarella crust. 2.  The service is great--all the time.  In addition to the great service, you can tell the staff love working with each other *and* enjoy their work.  It's a pleasure to be around people who are so genuinely engaged. 3.  The ambiance is inviting and tasteful.  I'll keep coming until I've tried their menu then move on to the next place on my list in this new town of mine.  Until then (and probably quite often in the interim), I'll enjoy this gem.  Greg",

On my most recent visit to the Life is Beautiful festival in downtown , I spent an entire afternoon here with my cousins. I sampled 3 types of coffee all of which remind me of my trip to Madrid. I thoroughly enjoyed the iced honey lavender latte and a single shot of espresso .  I also sampled a lox bagel, empanadas , and several other conceptually dynamic appetizers. The food is tasty but it can use a little fine tuning.  More focus on composition of flavors rather than the presentation would take the dishes to the next level. The fried plantains make an appealing garnish but they add little to the overall taste.  Maybe soft plantains would make more sense.   Service was very friendly but slow and that's great if it is the vibe they are going for. Stay a while. Chat. Siesta!",

My friend asked our server, Kevin, what's popular and he tells her it depends on her taste. Which just seemed like a weird answer. I told him it was it was our first time and wanted to try the popular items. Our server just seemed dry and uninterested in helping us. I asked him about the chicken omelette special and he was so vague. I was like fine I'll just try it. I asked Kevin twice if they has pastries and he just ignored me. Our lattes come out. I got the Mexican spice latte with almond milk and I wasn't impressed. It was luke warm and lacked flavor. It was just bland. My omelette was good. It was accompanied with plantain chips which were a also good. My friend got the tomato bisque which was also luke warm but pretty good.  Our server left and we never had anyone come by our table after. Since I wasn't a fan of the latte I wanted to get an ice coffee. I had to get up and ordered from the manager. She came to our table and cleared everything off which we has already pushed aside. My friend got a chai latte to go and she said it was horrible. She ended up throwing it out.  I love the vibe in here and the good was good but the lattes suck, luke warm and bland.",

I enjoyed everything but gave it only 4 stars because the coffee arrived after we had finished eating our meal (we wanted it with our meal) and baristas made a good cup/siphon of coffee but were not that knowledgeable about the coffees they offered (at least to a serious coffee geek).  Would definitely come back.",

That beautiful overcast after the storm type of weather that begs for a warm coffee and good conversation.  Ordered:  Mexican Spiced Latte- 5/5  Super flavorful! You definitely knew what you were drinking not like some places where your order a specialty latte and what flavor its supposed to have is completely hidden away under a heavy layer of coffee taste.   ***Bonus Points for having an adorable heart design on top of my latte***  Bionico- 5/5  What a wonderful way to kick start my morning! Fresh, seasonal fruit (Pears and Strawberries) layered on top of a decent bed of crunchy granola topped with a scoop of Greek Yogurt and finished off with a light drizzle of warm honey. Light and fresh, this was everything a breakfast should be.",

It's sometimes the little things :) I also tried the empanadas. They weren't traditional as the pastry crust was just puff pastry but they were pretty good! The carne was better than the shrimp. But the coffee was the star and I'll be back for more when I'm shopping!",

    "text": "Very VERY cute spot!  I'm here as I write this. Even tho they open at 7am, I thought I'd be the only one here...let's be honest, who's in this area at 10am... I sit corrected because there were a few patrons at the coffee bar, community table, and a few tables on the floor.   I sat at the community table (as I am solo-dolo) & I wanted to get some work done.   Immediately ordered the cortadito as I order wherever I see it on the menu....loved the presentation with the HEART coffee art in the middle. It was strong and distinct in flavor.   Christian, the manager, offered me a toffee biscotti which they get from a local bakery & and ice tea with cinnamon on top, which they just made and like to play around with the flavors.  The ice tea was super refreshing and was an added kick of flavor with the cinnamon.  Biscotti, which I normally don't like, was good in todd flavor but, SOFT, which I especially liked. Reminded me of a cookie!   Ordered the chorizo brussel sprouts, which we're TO-DIE-FOR! Chorizo everywhere with few pieces of grilled shrimp. But, that pungent red wine vinegar taste was just up my alley!!!! Crunchy, savory, and very meaty. The only bad thing I have to say it, I think the shrimp were grilled too long because it was kind of tough.   As I ate that, barista Sean, offered me a spiced almond mint coffee and OH-MY-GAWD, it was perfect for this weather. Lots of cinnamon, creamy, and I think bits of mint in it. I could just picture myself drinking this by the fireplace and getting all cozy-wozy. Perfect for cuddle season :)   I would love to try more of their slow-drips but, I'll wait to go with my boyfriend as he's the True coffee lover!  Reviews talk about the long wait for items but, I haven't found that as such.  Workers are great. Super friendly and pretty attentive considering how must they've gotten since I've sat here.   As I sit here with 3 cups of drinks in front of me, I am happy!  ***15 minutes after I write this review*** UPDATE  This place is now buzzing with customers and my community table is now filled with a group of rather good-looking Aussie (some kind of accent) men talk about how to market their brand and how DTLV is changing culturally for the better... Totes hipster -- I LIKE IT! lol this place is something I can very well picture in San Francisco.   The manager, also, brings out Ojaldras (honey orange batter, cinnamon sugar, lechera) with seasonal #peppermint ice cream and fruits. It's one of their sweet treats and reminds me of a filipino dish with the cinnamon sugar fried batter chip thingies (Ojaldras). Paired with the seasonal peppermint ice cream it was L O V E!  I'm so full. All I came for was the cortadito.   I swear, I need to get a bigger tummy to inhale more food/drink as a Yelper!",

We got 2 Arepa Bennys, one chicken Benny, a yogurt parfait, and I ordered the Latin Hash. We all greatly enjoyed our meals, and everything came out in no time at all.   Our wonderful server was Ruben. He was super friendly and helped us out with anything we needed.

All the dishes I saw looked really good. They have a Latin themed cuisine which includes staples like Arepas, Empanadas and a some other Latin comforts. I had the Chorizo Omelette with spinach, mushrooms and Parmesan and it came with some plantains on the side that I crunched up on top of the Omelette. Such a win since I was just expecting a coffee shop! Love this place and I'll be back for drinks before I leave Vegas.",

Clean and modern, you almost forget you're in old downtown Las Vegas. They have a couple couches to relax in and a row of USB ports at the bar.  I saw a food menu and pictures on Yelp and can't wait to try the food, too.  As for the coffee, it's delicious. These guys definitely know their stuff.  I will be coming back as much as possible to try different beans prepared in different styles.  Apparently their hours for the first month will only be 11:30-3:30, but starting in December they said they'll have their full 7am-7pm hours. This will definitely be my new hangout to get some work done. Much more comfortable a spot then The Bean.",

    "text": "This eatery reminds me of all the hip eateries in Austin, Texas but cheaper. We ordered chilaquiles, arepas benny, and house coffee. The chilaquiles were layered with scrambled eggs, black beans, tortilla chips, and a green sauce with just the right touch of heat. We ate it all up. It was a unique idea to use arepas for the base of the benny and it worked! The two arepas were topped with pulled beef, spinach, and runny eggs. The pulled beef needed more seasoning, but overall taste was very good. The fried plantains that came with the benny didn't add anything to the dish. Coffee was very good and worked perfectly with our dishes. Table service from the waiter was very attentive without being intrusive. We can definitely recommend this place with no hesitation.",

Well I did not come for the location or decor though.   I ordered the Honey Vanilla Latte and I did like it but it is very milky tasting.   I ordered the Empanadas (it said it came with 2) so I asked for one of the chicken tinge and one of the carne desmechada. They said yes not a problem then charged me 50 cents extra. It is just 50 cents, but I think they should tell customers if they plan to charge more. The sauce on top of the empanada is overkill, not in a good way. It is very strong and took over the flavor of the meat inside of the empanada, or was there barely any meat? Oh, that too. There was maybe 1.5 tablespoons of meat inside the empanada, and I did not like either one. I thought the price was really high 6.50 for 2 tiny empanadas. The meat inside was flavorless and the empanada pastry shell for lack of a better word was flaky and not tasty, I ended up eating the meat out of the inside and didn't eat the outside because it was drenched in sauce.   On a side note it was 110 outside and I swear it must have been 85-90 in there. I am not sure if their air was broken or they are just trying to save money on cooling, but it was uncomfortable. I took the food to go because of it.   I hope their other food is better with these high reviews.   I would probably only be back for coffee and I am interested in the Lavender Latte.",

Some friends invited me to have lunch & of course my little one had to come since I'm a stay-at-home mom. She loves to get out as much as I do, shes very good in public. Well I tried my best to keep all items on the table away from her except for her lunch snacks. SOMEHOW she grabbed my full cup of iced lavender latte & spilt it all over herself & and all around us! Then proceeded to scream because it was cold..go figure! I was so embarrassed, being that I was the only one there who had their kid with them..of course. Despite the chaos, the staff jumped into action SO QUICK! They politely helped me dry off my soaked little one, whilst wiping down her seat, mopping the floor, cleaning off her bib & replacing my coffee free of charge! That has been the greatest service I have  experienced so far as a new mother out in public! Every single staff member who worked today was so friendly & gracious! I will be telling all my friends about the professionalism displayed today! Not to mention how DELICIOUS my Iced Lavender Latte was when I finally got to drink it! They need a drive thru ASAP so I can give them my money without causing a scene next time! Haha no but for real I'll be coming back frequently now that I know they can handle anything my kid throws at them!",

I was extremely disappointed because I've heard great things about the place and the decor is gorgeous. Located on one of the more hip parts of town I would've expected a lot more. In the restaurants defense, the waitress tried to steer me away from what I ordered by recommending something else. Perhaps maybe she knew how lame that meal was? I would recommend it be taken off the menu to be honest. That way, no one else's first time there is a negative one. Any way, the coffee was great. I had the cold brew and it was nice and strong. If this was just a coffee spot I would give it 5 stars just based on the coffee, but it's not. Probably won't be coming back, I mean $23.00 bucks for a bad meal just sucks man.",

Their house-made lavender syrup IS as beautiful as everyone raves - try it in an iced (almond milk!) latte or a cocktail. Coffee in a V60 pourer is par excellence; although not roasted in-house it's sourced sustainably and fair-trade. I typically drink the Bolivian. There is a Stella Artois tap that is always tempting, but since this place closes at 4pm, I'm usually still in coffee mode. But the baristas have told me that 2017 is the year to expand: location #2 AND dinner/late-night hours are on the horizon! I'm pumped for that.  The la paisa is phenomenal. The perfect arepa-based breakfast complete with sunny side up egg on top and accompanied by rice. The other popular breakfasts food look phenomenal as well: I've never seen a Latin-fusion place with quite the flair as this one.  Spacious, including a patio, and a bar. The staff is all fantastic: pleasant, accommodating, conversational. Love this spot; will be back as often as I can.",

Post-seating, we got our food after a brief wait.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the food could've been hotter. It wasn't cold, but you could tell it had sat for a few minutes.  The coffee was extremely bold, which I like. So if you like bold, then I recommend the Italian.  My father ate the Arepa Benny, which was absolutely delicious. I got the bagel with lox. Eating the entire thing was no problem. I would've liked fewer herbs in the cream cheese, but otherwise I loved it.  Great decor. Simple, but done well. I would love to return one day if I ever come back to Las Vegas. If you are going, I recommend parking on California Ave right next to the restaurant.",

My friend and boyfriend got the arepa benny which they enjoyed as well. Then my friend's husband got the chicken tinga empanadas (also good) and the chorizo brussel sprouts (a little underwhelming).

The breakfast croissant was great and I enjoyed the empanadas. The vibe is very urban and trendy- perfect for downtown.  Price is affordable as well. I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu!",

Our waiter was very friendly, even to my 3 year old daughter. They bring you a large bottle full of ice cold water, which I loved. I ordered the Chilaquiles and an Iced Salted Caramel Latte. Let me just say the Chilaquiles just melted in your mouth, so full of flavor. I devoured every single bite. It was also the just right amount of food. So you felt full without overeating. The Salted Caramel Latte was just sweet enough, rich and creamy. I could have drank several. And I know it's a little detail but the ice they used in the latte was perfect. Similar to slushy ice, not big ice cubes. They were very accommodating and let my daughter order cheesy scrambled eggs that weren't on the menu. She had their orange juice which was so fresh. They even gave us a to go cup for it. We cannot wait to go back.",

So good that I ordered the chilaquiles, sat and sipped a French Press coffee for about 30mins, and then ordered a second entre.  Seriously, am eating breakfast and lunch in the same place.  The $10 Uber ride from the Strip was totally worth it.  The coffee?  A couple of distinctly different options.  The staff?  Nice, educated, attentive without hovering.  Coffee knowledge? I asked the staff to recommend one of their coffee's based on my taste and he nailed.  Free wifi throughout, comfy outdoor patio, dog friendly, and no smoking inside or out.  Menu is full of veggie and gluten-free options, full bar, lots of locals, and nothing but class.  I walked in and despite being a tourist I immediately felt at peace.  No slot machines, no neon signs, and no creepy stereotypical Vegas lounge-lizard types ... just normal people, nice people.",

We asked where our drinks were and they told us we couldn't get them until we were seated. About an hour and fifteen minutes after waiting we were seated then ordered right away. It took an additional 45 minutes after ordering that we got our food. Nobody told us it was coming out shortly or anything. The food was okay, but being a local, I would not come back. No one even apologized for us being here for 2 hours or the slow service. We should have left after the 45 minute wait for our coffee but we wanted to give Makers & Finders a chance.",

I decided to give them another try since I'll be taking training in the area for the next 3 months and they are very close.  I stopped by last week during first friday and the service was on point.  Very happy with the beverage I got as well, the Lavender Fog was yummy.  Today I came in so everything was great last week and I was very disappointed.  Bad service!!!  It took my server about 5 minutes to come to my table, I gave him my latte order and told him I was still deciding what I wanted to eat.  Well, the host that seated me brought my latte to my table and asked if he could take the beverage menu.  I told him yes and that I knew what I wanted to eat.  He looked up at my waiter to see what he was doing and then he took the order himself.  The waiter never came back to my table!!!  Someone else brought my food out and the original waiter never came to ask me how my food was or if I needed anything else.  I had to ask another host for my check. She went and told the waiter and he just laid it down on my table without saying a word.  I had to tell him to take the check as well when I put the card in their for payment..  I don't understand what his problem was.  They were busy, but he still had time to assist the two tables next to me, bring them their food and check on them.  My table he ignored!!  I will never come back here again...",

Aside from our server, Cody, the customer service overall was pretty poor.

    "text": "Main Street is under construction, but when I visit First Friday, I always see this new restaurant in the Las Vegas Art District named Makers and Finders Coffee. This morning, I had a meeting with a local Artists that I met at Robin's Skin City Body Painting. Arriving early from the north near City Hall, I asked for the best signature dish in the restaurant. The place was packed at breakfast. Brunch, even more people came in, especially athletes from the health clubs around Main Street. Recently written about in the east coast newspaper, Washington Post, Justin Lepper had just finished working on a painting all night long. I felt bad. He only drank coffee. No sleep. No rest. I asked for the signature dish that defines the restaurant. The eggs with beef were outstanding. Everybody was really friendly. The servers didn't act like staff. Really they acted as if they were having a little party and you were invited to walk in and join them. Very comfortable, nice, kept checking on us. I really want to return for the salmon lox breakfast. Maybe next week.",

Since we were here we also had some food and it was so good we both devoured it.  I eat eggs Benedict all over the country and I'd say they made one of my top 5 ever!  The albacore sandwich had this great refreshing taste.  If you don't try this place you are truly missing out an a great experience!",

So the bad part. First time here I came on a Sunday eating alone it shouldn't be too hard to service me. First off I was the one who had to always always grab their attention to get me water, box to go, and my check. It took them awhile.

We were not greeted as soon as we walked in, it might have been like 10 minutes before they asked how many in our party. The menu option is good. The cleanliness is something I would look into and make sure it's done correctly because the women's bathroom was completely nasty. There's only 2 stalls available, and the one that was available for my daughter the toilet was clogged. I had to unclog it and clean the seat for her. And the huge barrel trashcan next to the sink is NASTY. There were visible, bloody, sanitary products visible. That is the last thing someone wants to see before they eat. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food. It was good for the most part. The fries were a little too oily, but good.  For my first time here I gotta say I had an ok experience.  Glad to say my husband and daughter enjoyed their time more then I did.",

It was so delicious I had the hubby drive me there the next day before our flight home. It was so good even he got one the second time around. The menu seemed interesting and we would have ordered if it hadn't been for the free buffet we were offered with our hotel deal. Next time we stop into Vegas we are definitely gonna come back for a nice breakfast and a lavender latte.",

Let me start by saying the food menu sounded great and I was pumped for some eggs benedict. My friend and I got there and were seated in their super cute dining room (tres hipster chic or something). We got coffee... I had the latte made with condensed milk, she got a special - lemon latte of sorts. That drink could have gone one of two ways, great or horrific. Obviously, it was great. Like coffee with a light lemon cookie inside, so tasty. My coffee was also primo delicious. Sweet, but not too sweet.   Now the food.... we both got the eggs benedict, described like a Mexican eggs benedict with the bread being an arepa and having some kind of slow cooked meat on top and a jalapeno hollandaise or something... sounds good, right? Wrong. The 'arepa' was not what I have known to be an arepa in other restaurants (aka a flat masa type pancake with a filling inside that is soft, warm and delicious), this was hard, like it was made a day or two ago, kind of chewy/dense, and not filled with anything. The meat was tough and obviously not cooked long enough. The hollandaise was mediocre at best. I didn't even finish my plate, I was so disappointed.   Take home point: Come here for coffee, skip the food.",

    "text": "Well, it's a hard one to write. I wanted to love this place. Feeling forever disheartened about the lack of enticing or unique places to eat or sit with a cup of coffee in Vegas, most places generally located in ugly and/or plain strip malls or in areas that are visually less than appealing, I'd hoped that Makers and Finders would be that enjoyable spot to meet up with a friend. Located on Main Street over in the Arts District area and across from stores such as Retro Vegas and Buffalo Exchange, it seems that few city blocks are beckoning the artsy, hip and eclectic to come join the gentrification movement like over by Container Park. Keep working on it... The outside offers a few tables and sofa to sit under a covered patio area. Inside has black wooden tables and plastic, white chairs that sit opposite of the coffee bar area, illuminated with a neon M&F sign.  I ordered the Lavender Latte which was rather nice. Thick foam mixed with subtle floral notes of lavender was a different, yet pleasant change from my regular vanilla latte that has become my daily staple.  My friend ordered the seasonal coconut-turmeric latte which I sampled and while coconut is not my favorite flavor, it was in fact, delicious.  We ordered Chicken Tinga empanadas which honestly, were a bit oily and did not hold the typical Tinga spice which to I am accustomed. Having lived in Mexico and have traveled throughout central and south America, these empanadas did not hold up to my past experiences.  The kale Cesar salad was good, however the kale could have been chopped up a bit more, the leaves were ginormous.  My friend ordered the chorizo and brussels sprouts salad. I did not try it, but she said it wasn't as good as her previous times ordering it.  The service, very pleasant, very friendly, but seemed a bit slow or off. My friend asked for salsa  or whatnot multiple times. Our lattes took over 15 minutes.  I'd probably return for a coffee date. The food I'd have to try something else next time, as well.",

My go-to is the lavender fog, or the fries here are delicious. The empanadas are all amazing as well as the tomato bisque with a delicious, buttery cheese croissant. I've also had the chai tea latte, tastes like a warm churro. Yum.  There's a charming little area where you can sit outside in the shade. The chair are really uncomfortable, but there is the option of sitting on the couch.   If you're ordering coffee to go, it might take a bit longer than you'd expect but still so good and it's worth being five minutes late to work.  Side note, all of these artsy little coffee shops downtown have that vibe where it seems like they're going to forget about your order. This hasn't happened to me yet though.",

I like trying new, different and original flavors especially when it comes to coffee.  I've had a lavender latte before but it's hard to find at coffee shops.   Their lavender infused latte is actually really good! 5 stars for that. My husband was skeptical but interested in their lemon bar latte. I made him try it. He loved it. I liked it too.  Their coffee is not too sweet or overly strong. It has a nice subtle hint of flavor.  They use crushed ice like Coffee Bean and tea leaf. Their iced lattes are perfect for this hot Vegas weather.  Interior is clean. Service was nice and pleasant.",

    "text": "Arepa Benny ($10): Golden poached eggs, coffee-rubbed beef, grilled tomato, salsa verde hollandaise. Overall, slightly bland, which is surprising considering the ingredients. The arepa wasn't very tasty on its own and neither was the beef. Even the hollandaise lacked oomph. Everything just lacked flavor (or salt).  Chorizo Brussels Sprouts ($12): Grilled shrimp, crispy onion, sauteed mushroom, ground and sliced chorizo. **We were told that the chef refused a shipment of Brussels sprouts that morning, so they offered Kale instead.** Perhaps this dish is best with Brussels sprouts and only with Brussels sprouts. Although the kale was nice, it was just an odd concoction and needed a lot more chorizo. The grilled shrimp was really wonderful.  Chicken Tinga Empanada ($6): Chipotle chicken, lime avocado sauce. This was probably the best item we tried. Great flavors and composition of the empanada. I would eat it again.  Crispy Fries w/ Garlic Aioli & House Sauce ($5). The fries were really great. I didn't care for the sauce drizzled on top - I guess it was supposed to be the garlic aioli, but it tasted almost like honey mustard (weird). The house sauce was good.  Lavender Infused Latte ($6): This is probably the most intriguing item on the beverage menu and both of us couldn't resist. You would smell the lavender, but you couldn't taste it. Subtle is an understatement. Perhaps it's best that way, but it seems that if you're going to make a fuss over a coffee infused with something, it better taste like that something. It was still a nice latte. My friend also ordered a Cuban Espresso ($4) at the end of our meal. Holy cow, that stuff will put hair on your chest!  I really like the space and the menu seems so fun, but the food was disappointingly underwhelming. I was definitely expecting a better food experience. On the other hand, the coffee was good and the staff was fantastic. Overall, it was a nice place to hang out with coffee, but I would skip the eats.",

When \"Makers\" first opened in the Arts District of Las Vegas in October of 2014, we were thirsty for a neighborhood coffee spot, and they delivered. Plus, they brought an amazing menu with incredible food options.  How lovely it was to be part of the first group of regulars. Daily hugs and smiles.   Always a great place to get coffee with a laptop, or meet a contact for a lunch meeting.   As an original customer, I'm a bit biased, but in all honesty, I'm constantly amazed with the plethora of new faces that come and patronize my favorite spot. Endless networking opportunity.   When the team decided to extend the hours, to include dinner time, they extended the menu. The new menu kept all the classics, like my favorite Arepa Benny, but it also added a handful of more affordable and filling options. They also added great Happy Hour options, and alcoholic beverages.   Rumor has them opening a new location in Summerlin this fall, that'll be great to meet my peeps who don't often frequent into the downtown districts.   Keep it up Ya'll",

Mind you I ordered extra avocado or an avocado salad and still didn't come close. It suppose to have cotija cheese on top and I can't even say it had a sprinkle. I don't know if they were in a rush or what the deal was but very disappointed with what I was given.  I will admit the flavor was amazing and for that reason I would try it again to see if prepare it better if I'm at the restaurant instead of ordering for delivery.

By this I mean it's clearly hipster and hipsters aren't nice to people.  I needed some caffeine and it was too hot for coffee so I opted for an iced coffee. I had to ask for some cream and sugar as there is none hanging around as you might expect. Once I got my levels situated the drink itself was good, nothing too remarkable about the taste of the coffee really.   Of note however was that I emptied it in about 5 sips. As it turned out it was more ice than coffee. This was extremely aggravating when I paid just over $4 with tax. Ouch. I went back up to the counter and requested a refill in order to get somewhere near more than 2 oz of actual coffee - they did this without hesitation and with a smile so that was nice.   I might check this place out again as they seem to have some innovative drinks and the food looks/sounds pretty good.",

It's a small place so not sure what the hold up was but they had to apologize three different times for how long it took for our food to come out.   They have outside seating which is a plus. The service is good and they are overall friendly.

Worst service I've had. Worst service I've seen given to others. I was ignored upon entry, 2 parties were taken to tables before me, even after I held up 2 fingers and said \"party of 2\", the waitress walked past me, didn't even acknowledge me, and then took the people who came in 5 minutes after me. Then waited outside for water (it's 100 degrees plus out) and got nothing, people who had been sitting out here longer didn't even have their order taken when I got mine taken (still no water). I'm only giving 2 stars because the food was OK and the place was rather busy. Need a stationed hostess or manager to make sure people are served in order, or at least seated in order.",

Every dish that I've ordered has been tasty, fresh, and delicious! Oh and they might just have the best fried plantains. YUM  The coffee is the super hipster, fancy coffee... Which I'm not complaining about. From a black iced coffee to a fancy lavender honey late, there are ZERO complaints. The quality of coffee alone is worth the drive downtown.   My service has always been outstanding, whether sitting outside or up at the bar, it's always a great experience.   I'm not one for hipster joints but this one has my heart with amazing dishes and coffee! Definitely worth trying! Although watch the time because they close a bit early !",

The coffee was good and very refreshing and the sandwich was pleasant with a flaky croissant and fresh eggs. Flavors were on point with the peppered bacon, and the texture of the sandwich was nice. Coffee was good but slightly watery (this totally could have been my fault for not drinking it quickly enough though).

We grabbed two menus and sat at a table. A few moments later a guy from behind the counter came and brought us water and took our drink order, which was a latte and a coffee. To make a long story short, we sat and watched other people come in and sit at the counter and receive their drink orders while no one came with our drinks or said ANYTHING at all. It was AT LEAST 10 minutes. I get really tired, real fast of this hipster, barista, cliquey-ass, bourgeois attitude and air at a lot of these places. We walked out. And here I am aggravated and writing this review. I watched \"United Shades of America\" with Kamau Bell on CNN and he was in Portland, which is full of hipsters, yet no one admits to being one. Own the douchery. And, do yourself a favor, think twice about going to Makers and Minders unless you are an obvious card-carrying asshat hipster. Then, maybe you'll get treated like they want your business. Oh, and the chairs are cheap. And they suck.",

One took our order another one brought us condiments, then the first one brought our drinks.. As soon as we were seated we immediately were poured water by Josh. I had both my children and though the place is extra trendy they accommodated my kids very well.  Food was above average. I had the kale mushroom chorizo omelette.. Chorizo was a little to salty for my taste. But the kale was cooked very well! Bf had the carnitas skillet.. Again above average taste. portion wise though he could have had more, but not a big deal. My son had the croissant sandwich w/maple bacon; egg was fluffy and he ate a whole half.. which for a 7y/o was more than enough. The issue was w/my daughters chicken tinga omelette. :\\ she got about halfway through it and then she discovered egg shells. Seemed very strange but we let the waitress know she offered another plate, but it would have been a waste. So she just took it off our bill. Not sure what that was about, but overall enjoyed the white chocolate iced latte and hope to be back with the bf for a cute breakfast date.",

I would say the staff was friendly, but everything else was a disappointment. I only went to this place bc Yelp due to good reviews. I was very disappointed. It was close to an hour before we got our food. It took the waiter a long time to come back, if it was to take our order or bring our food. When the food came, it was warm close to cold. My BF order the Latin Hash (skillet type) dish and it was cold and the potatoes was hard. I ordered Arepa Benny (an egg Benedict type) dish. Both dishes was seasoned well and it tasted good. However, it felt like it was under the heat lamp awhile so it didn't taste fresh. I think we watched our waiter talking and eating his own food. I also got an almond milk latte and it had a strong coffee taste, didn't taste any thing like the name. I would say close to no almond flavor in it at all. Lastly, we went to the bathroom before leaving and walked by the kitchen and we could see, it was well staffed. And at the coffee bar, there were two more staff and another two as waiters. I don't understand why the heck my food took forever?! Probably would never return here due to the wait plus the food was so so. Overall, this place wasn't worth the wait.",

Don't know if they've added them now.  Second time, sat in to get work done. Since they've officially opened, place was much more busier than my last. A couple and myself were just standing around the entrance because we didn't know what to do! Was it seat yourself or did we have to wait to get seated? Noone approached us as everyone was busy serving so I approached a server then got seated. There's a \"community table\" where I guess most of those who are solo and with a laptop go. Since it was full, I sat at the couches that was conveniently next to an outlet. Once seated, someone took my order immediately.  Ordered the chorizo brussel sprouts and a honey vanilla latte with almond milk. Both came out in a timely manner. The brussel sprouts dish was pretty amazing. Pieces of meat, mushrooms, some grilled shrimp topped with crispy onions in red wine vinegar. Mmm. Latte was good too. So far, the coffee drinks have been a hit.  Place is cool and music is spot on. I enjoyed hearing Flume, Flight Facilities, What So Not, and Disclosure. If you're into that type of music, no need to listen to your own. Parking isn't bad and there's usually spots not too far. There's also wifi but be sure to ask the pw for guest2 because the open one sucked.  I understand that they're still fairly new and working on things but checking out took me a good 20 minutes from when I asked for the check and actually left. I still give this place 4 stars because the products they represent are good. Just needs some work on service and organization but it's nothing too major that would stop me from coming back.",

The space was amazing with a industrial feel on the inside but it was still inviting, outside had space heaters and small tables to enjoy a beautiful day here in Las Vegas.  The food was really really good, the sliders were moist and very flavorful even after sitting in a warmer (we went back for thirds)  The fact that they had Truffle Fries with truffles amazed and thrilled me, the bonus is they were legit and delicious.  There were lots of other food items and all were good.  Space- Amazing Food- Flavorful, Thrilling, Delicious... Kitchen Staff (people who actually work there) pleasant, accommodating, helpful, fast, and good cooks.  The front of the house was not the staff and that is who I reviewed, now that I know the front of the house staff was rented I advise the owners to review that choice because I did not review all I saw behind the bar.  However you in the back of the house did amazing.  The food service was top notch and the food taste was amazing.  Thank you for clarifying who I am indeed reviewing, you.",

One word, awesome! Tried the tomato soup that has chunks of potatoes, kale, onions, and chorizo. Had a bit of heat to it, but was hearty and delicious. Main course, I did the Arepas Benedict. The Arepa part of the dish took some getting used to, but it worked. With a grand opening on December 5th, this place is already super busy. Talk of a dinner menu being added later on down the road. Sounds like a great plan! Servers were superb with very attentive service. Suggestions were offered and smiles were a flowing. This place is definitely worth the trip and is a great addition to a dismal area.",

Absolutely delicious with a touch of sweet from the fruit and a touch of salt from the bacon! We also had the Arepa Benny or something like that. It as well had such a brilliant bold mix of flavors.

They came out and they were fluffy, flakey, buttery and delicious tasting, thus NOT at all GF. If you can eat anything without repercussion, this place will be fine for you.

Every thing was delightful my only gripe is I thought it was a bit pricey. So the tea was 5.5 and I am ok with that because it was delicious and I am sure not super simple to make. It was very fresh. The salad however was 11.5 plus 3 dollars for grilled chicken. It was tasty, filling, and I would get it again because I can't get anything healthy near my work BUT 14.5 for the salad feels over priced. I would come here once a week at least if the prices on food were more reasonable. I will be back for coffee though!",

Both the hostess and the owner(Josh) explained to me that the coffee was \"made to order from scratch\"(which kind of annoyed me, because it was repeated word for word) but this excuse can only go so far in a breakfast-lunch restaurant.   The saving grace was my waiter, who could tell I was agitated by the length of time and gave me a discount on my already considerably low bill. I can tell it has potential, but \"soft opening\" or not, if you have the word COFFEE in your name, you should hire at least TWO baristas to handle your demand for it.",

Couldn't have had a better breakfast with the squad!",

You get this casual, trendy, hipster kind of vibe.   Coffee drinks were delicious! I ordered one of the most talked about drinks; the lavender infused latte. Not too sweet and you can definitely taste the caffeine. Got a delicious hint of lavender. Yum! I've got my eye on the honey vanilla latte or the coconut turmeric latte. Next time, for sure! My iced latte came in a mason jar....so cute!  I ordered the kale chorizo omelet, hold the mushrooms. Comes with plantain chips. Typing this is making my mouth water. Portions were just right. Boyfriend ordered the croissant sandwich. We both loved what we ordered and it would definitely be a repeat if we're not up to trying anything new but I want to try the empanadas next time.    Street parking only. We were here around 11 ish and we managed to find the last spot close to the restaurant. I can imagine it may be a bit difficult to find parking during peak lunch hours. Indoor and outdoor seating. The patio area is dog friendly.",

It took longer than I thought it would be--almost 5 minutes--but it was brought just as my friends were entering the shop.    Salted caramel will get me anytime and this was no exception.  A good tasting coffee with the right amount of flavoring and salt.  There is wifi offered by I didn't get the password so I went without using their wifi.  The place was fairly quiet when I went in for our 2:00 pm meeting, but by the time I was leaving a short time before 4, the place was fairly crowded and quite lively.  This is definitely worth another visit to try for breakfast or to get an empanada that I saw on their menu.  I will be back.",

The lavender-infused latte (added a shot because I always need the extra jolt) was so yummy. Complete with the cute little heart image created in foam (didn't get a pic because I didn't want to be THAT girl lol). But it even has a few sprinkles of lavender on top. The drink was so smooth and the lavender infusion was subtle and didn't taste like I was drinking a flower.   The service was wonderful and she checked on us often.   The menu looks amazing, as I will definitely be back for the delicious Latin dishes!   Go quick! Drink the lavender latte! Sit on the patio (not in the summer) and people watch- I know I'll be back to do that :)",

There was a little bit of a wait for indoor dining, so we decided to sit out on the patio. It was cozy outside and the weather was good, though the table was a bit small for two.  Our server was very attentive and friendly, but I could tell that he was pretty new and inexperienced.   The menu is fairly large, and there are a lot of interesting items on the menu. I ended up ordering an empanada sampler platter, and my friend one of the benedicts. The food was all very tasty, though portions moderate and I wasn't completely full at the end of my meal.  Overall, a very quaint breakfast/brunch place with unique offerings.  P.S. Street parking only.",

We were told by the hostess that it would be a 5-10 minute wait for a table for two.  However, the wait turned into a 30 minute wait with people who came after us being seated first.  It wasn't until my co-worker located a manager did we receive seating.  Once seated our serve came over and asked us if we were ready to eat.  At this point, because of our long wait we already had an idea of what we wanted to eat.  However, it would have been nice for our waiter to provide us with a few suggestions on things to try.   During our visit I ordered the Empanda Sampler  and the Turket Club.  My co-worker ordered the Arepa Benny. We both enjoyed the Empanda Sampler, that had Short rib, chicken tinga, garlic shrimp, queso & spicy mushroom + sauces.  Once we received the sampler, we wish we didn't order the additional items, as the sampler was more than filling for the both of us.  If you are Downtown in the Art District, stop in and try this place out.",

It really is a gem of the neighborhood. I had the smoked salmon benedict and love that it was gluten free- their cold brew was delicious as well! Everything had a hint of cayenne and spice but not overpowering. My only complaint was that service was slow- the hostess, the waiter, and the barista (my coffee took forever- never something anyone wants!) Will definitely try out their Summerlin location and want to return for their violin brunch!",

They are definitely maximizing the space for dining.  The service was quite slow, that was the start of things. I had a cold brew coffee which was pretty good. I also had the Latin Hash which was really tasty. My girlfriend had the empanada bowl. She said the empanadas were really good, the salad that came with it was good, and the beans were good. The rice however, was super bland and not great.  She ordered a cafe con leche to go and we waited about 10 minutes to get it. Then when it came, it was made wrong so we ended up having it taken off the bill and left.",

    "text": "Ahhhh, this place is a hidden gem in the Arts District. Despite this part of town being really secluded and sometimes full of sketchy people, this cute little cafe makes its mark. The exterior has cute twinkly lights with a sofa, while the interior has a cozy hipster coffee shop vibe.   Ribeye & egg: 4/5 The steak was thickkk and juicy, cooked to a nice medium rare, topped with a savory chimichurri sauce. The only downside was that the portion wasn't very filling.  Latin hash: 4/5 The potatoes were crispy on the outside and the meat was really tender. The bell peppers added a nice sweet hint to the item. The egg was cooked perfectly. Our food came out on small little skillets but the skillets seemed like decoration since they weren't hot. It'd be better served on a hot skillet.  Salted caramel latte: 5/5 Salty and sweet coffee- what a perfect combination.  Coffee Con Leche: 3/5 The coffee wasn't very strong, and it could have been sweeter. It just tasted like steamed milk. I would pass on this next time.   Service was excellent with our waitress being a super sweet girl who checked on us frequently. Our food came out hot within 8-9 minutes. Prices are a bit on the high end with each item costing $10 or more and the portion sizes weren't that big. Overall, this was a great place to grab coffee, a bit of brunch, and hang out in a cozy cafe. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're ever in Vegas. They offer interesting items such as bulletproof coffee, matcha bulletproof, and (a highly recommended) lavender latte.",

It was pretty busy when we walked in but there was room at the bar so we sidled up and were attended to immediately. We were given a couple menus and ordered coffee. The bartender gave us a tip that we should order small coffees and get refills instead of paying more for large coffees (and he even set us up with coffee to go when we were done!).   Hubby ordered the Veggie Benny (2 poached eggs, asparagus, mushrooms, roasted peppers, onions, chimichurri sauce, tomatoes served with plantain chips - $13) and I went with the Smoked Salmon Benedict (2 poached eggs, sauteed kale, red onions, tomato, chipotle hollandaise served with plantain chips - $14). Our dishes were plated beautifully and were delicious! I especially loved the unique ingredients - so different from your typical eggs benedict. While hubby isn't crazy about plantain chips, I am a fan so ended up eating some of his.   We loved everything about this place! It was nice to escape the \"glitz and glamour\" of Las Vegas for awhile. This place felt more like one you would find in San Francisco - with a cool, laid-back vibe.",

Skip the hotel buffet and eat here with the locals. Free street parking.   The dishes are Latin inspired comfort food, packed with flavor. They made the Arepas Benedict vegetarian for me on request, subbing in loads of sauteed vegetables for the meat. They were so filling, I didn't need to eat lunch that day. The added avocado was actually overkill, as the eggs and Hollandaise sauce were already so rich.  The home fries were crispy and perfect, I couldn't stop eating them, but goodness, it was so much food.   It would be nice if they added a vegan option or two, hence only four stars.",

Rare to find a place that serves coffee & tea AND beers & cocktails as well. They have a full bar and the dining area is decent. They also have a community table.   Interior is a mix of modern & retro. I especially love the bench seating along the wall. Nicely designed space. We didn't have enough time to have a full meal, so we ordered some small plates... the sauteed brussel sprouts (in lime juice with parmesan & pecan - this tasted like it was sauteed in butter, so good), the crispy fries (topped with crispy kale & side of their pink sauce AKA thousand island dressing). I have my eyes on their Latin comfort food menu like the lomo saltado & their empanadas for next time. Also, plantain chips... I'm coming back for you.   Service was okay. Food was decent and came in a timely manner. Definitely recommend.",

We ordered 2 Bon Bon's which is a chocolate espresso with steamed milk and a condensed milk base. After about 15 minutes or so (quite a long wait for just two coffees) they arrived and they were fairly underwhelming.  The coffee it's self was bitter but stirring the coffee with the condensed milk made it way too sweet. I tried to find a good middle ground and failed. I just don't think this particular beverage was to my taste.  We were handed the check and the waitress took a long time to come and collect it so we just decided to take it to her and leave.   Overall, the general experience isn't what I'm looking for when I just want a coffee. If that's your thing, go wild.",

It can be a little odd walking in because they offer to seat you, like at a restaurant. But there is a \"bar\" where you can sit, order just a coffee and get some work done.   I sat at the bar and ordered a wonderful Americano. I worked for a bit and decided I was hungry. Ordered the empanada lunch bowl. This is where the rating dropped.   The spicy mushroom was tasty, but greasy. I know it's deep fried, but it seemed overly greasy and almost unpleasant    The short rib was even worse, likely because of the fat from the meat.   The black beans had no flavor and the rice was uninspired.   I really wanted to like the place and the food, but it simply did not deliver. I would try it again in hopes that it was an off day, but I can't say I'd recommend it based on what I had.",

The food was good, the only thing was that I was expecting for the egg to be the same as how the picture was displayed even by looking at other yelp reviews and photos, but I wasn't either so I figured the egg would already come out that way. Also my food came out before my latte came out so that was kinda disappointing too. Food was great, just wish they had some hot sauce options to put on top, and on every other photo I've seen, the chilaquiles had a sunny side up egg on top and mine didn't.",

With a Latin inspired base this is one of my favorite breakfast or brunch menus in town. The empanadas are drool worth, I will never understand how they get them so crispy! The Latin Hash is another morning favorite of mine, it's excellent. They have enough options to provide variety, but not enough to overwhelm. The place is always clean, the decor is adorable, and the staff has been excellent on ever visit.

I took my mom and her friend on a Saturday morning after a nice outdoor yoga class at Symphony Park.    For it being a busy Saturday morning, our wait was minimal, which was a pleasant surprise since we planned for a little of a wait.  They also have a great front patio area with heaters to wait on.   The hostess was sweet and friendly, but our waitress was curt and didn't pay much attention to our table.  The food and coffee were amazing.  I had the chorizo omelette and my mom had the avocado toast.   My omelette was not overly spicy, but just the right amount of flavor and taste.    On street parking is close and convenient, but there wasn't a lot of it to come by, so that could be a challenge.",

We waited maybe 30-40 minutes for eggs and a burger and the place was maybe half full.   The table next to us got their food and pretty much finished before they brought our coffee out! Server didn't even come around asking how the food was or how coffee was tasting.   Food was delicious and flavorful but I couldn't taste the smoked salmon under their that chipotle hollandaise sauce. What a bummer!   Hipster place  Good for your Instagram photos Good for your taste buds Bad for your time. Walked in at around 11 and left around 1. That's not how long it should take to eat a quick brunch!",

Everything is reasonably priced, it's always busy but people eat quickly so you're not standing around forever. Johnny is the best server! Is he always attentive, accurate, and gives the most immaculate service ever. This is probably one of my favorite coffee/restaurant combo! Thanks guys for keeping my tummy full and my wallet happy!",

The prices do not fit the small portions. My lavender latte was FANTASTIC, but it was lukewarm, immediately after they handed it to me...LUKEWARM!!!!!!(almost cool!) The food is flavorful! But breakfast is not complicated, so no extra stars for that. The word \"coffee\" is in the establishment's name...how do you serve it lukewarm????? Some people may ask, \"Why not just let them know it's lukewarm so they can correct it?\". My answer is... \"I paid you for something that you claim is worth the price. So you are giving me your best already. If you didn't give me your best - what did I pay for? I should be paid to give you a second chance, because now... I'm training you!\" This is a business transaction, not an attempt at a friendship.  Now I have to go and get some hot coffee and a meal somewhere....",

My friend had a salmon eggs Benedict with chipotle hollandaise that really surprised me, the whole thing was good but the sauce was amazing...I will be having that the next time. Great ambience and a cool location on Main St right downtown in the art district.

Definitely try this place and support a solid local business!",

    "text": "So, me, my sisters and my cousin who lives in Vegas wanted to go cafe hunting. This was found by my cousin in Instagram and some decided to come here for lunch after a thrilling ride in Stratosphere.   The location is in downtown Las Vegas but in Arts District. Not a lot of people know where Arts District is because Las Vegas is still in the process of developing the area. Parking is difficult for only you could park along the street. It was a Saturday, so it was kind of expected that it will be a busy day for Vegas but I didn't expect that there's no parking lot nor structure.  Nevertheless, everything became so pleasant. As soon as I entered, I fell in love with its \"urban-artsy\" ambience. Coming here with only few customers on a Saturday, kind of gave me some itsy feeling to eat here. But oh boy, their food and drinks are AMAZING!!!!! I ordered Grilled Chicken Arepas and I was speechless how flavorful and delicious it was. My company ordered egg benedicts and Chicken Tinga empanadas and they were bomb!!   For drinks, I got their latte. The temperature was just right and with a little sweetness...thanks to the caramel drizzle on top. The froth is inadequate but not bad. My company ordered matcha latte and salted caramel latte and they are the best!!   For dessert, I fell in love with Espresso flan. It's a slice of flan poured with a shot of espresso, topped with whipped cream and strawberries. I wish I could've saved more space for dessert because I would've tried more for sure!!  Service is so fast. Food and drinks were served right away. Our server (forgot his name sorry, I'll do better next time) was very knowledgable and helpful. There are also artworks displayed and being sold. The place is so cute and I couldn't stop taking pictures! I just love how low-key this place is but has better food and service compared to a lot of overrated restaurants in the Strip. I'm so glad I found this place.",

The waiter was very friendly as well, asking me if I was expecting anyone and whether or not it was my first time there, helping me with suggestions on what's popular and what he liked.  I got an iced Nutella Latte and Arepa Benny. Both were delicious! The latte wasn't too sweet and was almost like a chocolate milk with some crushed ice. The Arepa Benny was delicious and I'd definitely have it again. The biscuit(?) it came on was a bit crunchy. The the beef was very well seasoned and flavored. The egg yolk was runny and delicious as well; perfect for being scooped up with the plantain chips.  Price is decent: around $5 for my latte and $10 for my eggs benedict.  Overall, good service, good food, and decent price. Good atmosphere for studying as well! Definitely recommended!",

This is super annoying because I dine out by myself pretty regularly due to business travel and I tend to spend quite a bit of money to make up for the fact that it is just me.  But to get that sense of frustration is ultimately annoying.  I was very interested in their lavender latte.  I don't generally like the smell in bath or home products but I've found I really enjoy it in food.  While the latte had a nice lavender flavor, the milk was a bit overpowering and i ended up feeling like i was sipping milk that was gently flavored with coffee and lavender.  In that sense, I would say it was \"okay\".  The food, however was very very good.  Not listed on the menu, but you can ask after pastries.  I had a chocolate croissant that was soft and delicious.  They did not warm it up and didn't offer to so I ate it cold but it would have been nice warm.  (to be fair i could have asked for them to warm it up).  I had a second drink just to try another menu offering and it was the same overpowering milk flavor.  I'm not sure if it's the coffee beans they use or that they need to add another shot or what.  I would still return and encourage others to try it out - it just wasn't a \"wow\" experience.",

No coffee shop on the planet does that for standard drip, so that's just insulting.  The coffee was good, but nothing special.  The server recommended a berry pastry.  It tasted like it was bought from the grocery store.  It was cold, rubbery, and nothing special.  The service was okay.  We asked if we could sit outside and the barista said yes they'll send someone out to take the order.  It took about 15 min.  The furniture was cheap and not very comfy like a good coffee shop.  As far as I could tell, no WiFi either.  Missing all the elements of a good coffee shop.",

I had so many hopes for it to be delicious, but it tasted like NOTHING HAD SALT. idk if it's because they were trying to be healthy or something, but it didn't impress me at all. The matcha also had a very chalky taste to it. But the presentation was beautiful. The waitress also looked like she needed an extra hand when it was really busy. Like you can ask for her a check and she would just get pissed off. But I don't blame her, I hated working for food service too. Anyways, super cool looking but wouldn't come here again (:",

We asked for hot sauce and never got it. We wanted desert but couldn't get waiters attention. Took a long time to get a check and pay.  Food was just mediocre. We ordered lox and bagel. Arepa Benny, and croissant sandwhich. The benny did not match the description on the menu \"salsa verde hollandaise?\" No salsa verde anywhere. Very basic. Grilled tomatoes?  Nada. Bagel was ok but simple. Coffee was good but nothing special.  Our bill for 4 was $70 and we left hungry.",

    "text": "Love this place!   It was easy to find since it wasn't too far from the busy cross streets of Main St. and Charleston. We were lucky to find a parking close to the location which was right outside of the restaurant. They don't have an actual parking lot in front of the location like you normally see here in Vegas. It was more of a location that was on the street and you would have to find \"meter parking\" if that makes any sense. They might have a parking lot behind or in a different location, you might just have to walk a little.   The restaurant was very clean and down to earth. Very simplistic and not beyond crazy with decorations. We were greeted the moment we walked in and we pretty much sat ourselves to the closest table available.   I tried the La Paisa dish and it was delicious! As soon as I read the description of what the dish consisted of, I was sold. The plantains chips that it came with was amazing! I mean the whole thing was just amazing!  I also tried the Lavender Tea Latte.. No words can express how wonderful this cup of tea was. I read the reviews before checking this place out and quite a few people recommended it so I just had to try it. I'm glad I got it because now whenever I come back again, that will be my go-to tea I'll be getting there forever and ever. Okay, maybe not forever but for awhile.",

    "text": "I'm fairly new to the area and a work contact asked to meet here on a Monday morning. It's in a very non-descript location in between some Mexican restaurants and mattress stores. Oh and it's next door to a Brewing co. so that's cool.   I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasant, polished atmosphere as I walked in. Well dressed people were sipping coffee and eating at tables in the all white, chic decor and plopped at the bar reading newspapers and chatting.   I was also surprised that I had the option to sit at a table, given a menu and had full service for a coffee date. They even had food too, had I wanted breakfast. (need to try the food next time).   I didn't know what to order, but the server was helpful, friendly and suggested the Cortadito. I said \"sure why not\". Oh, man was it amazing. It was tiny like an espresso drink and served in a mini-mason jar with a pretty heart drawn into the foamy top. I started sipping slowly and while a little bitter at first, it finished smooth and sweet. By the end of the drink, I realized this was probably the  best coffee I've ever had. Needless to say I live in Henderson but have gone out of my way to stop by and try other things. The next time I tried the honey & vanilla latte after asking for a drink that wasn't super sweet. The staff is so courteous, professional and polite!   Seriously, just do yourself a favor and go. Treat yourself.",

Cool atmosphere, located in the art district of downtown.. from the numerous reviews saying there's trouble finding parking, wasn't exactly True, found parking right around the building. Cute patio outside to sit out , when the weather is duable. Was greeted by a gorgeous worker, who was super friendly, always making sure we were pleased. I would recommend going early, like ( right when they open ) you can sit on the counter, which seems to be the most popular place to sit. Ordered the long awaited Lavender infused latte, with Arepa Benny.. Let me tell you something, it was amazing .. No, I don't even know if that's how you could describe it... how about .. made with love. The cilantro with the hollandaise just transported me to another dimension. Its a must try. Also a little note: the gentlemen waiters here are as yummy as the food.  Also my mom ordered the salted caramel iced latte, and that is A LIFE CHANGER ! As for the atmosphere, I do wish it had a little more funky, neat art inside.. but that's just my request. I am 110 % sure I will be coming back, they also have comfy couches, plenty of seating. Plus , a couple more outlets please. Thank you Makers & Finders for adding another well awaited dimension to my life.",

Welp, I think I finally found just the place! Love the layout and size. It was small, but everything was well spaced throughout the restaurant. There's a good amount of outdoor seating on the patio. Inside, there's a counter, seating area, and a couch tucked away in the corner. Different settings for different purposes!   My sister got the lavender latte, and I got the honey vanilla latte. The espresso was roasted perfectly and the flavors came through really well in the latte! The honey vanilla basically tasted like horchata with coffee. Service was also pretty friendly.   If you're into cafe hopping or just a solid cup of coffee, Makers & Finders is worth checking out. Definitely plan to revisit to brunch soon!",

    "text": "I was disappointed with Makers & Finders Coffee for many reasons. First off, after spending an extra 16 minutes driving across Las Vegas to this supposedly great coffee establishment, I find 1. A rather frosty reception from the maitre d'. Makers & Finders is more a  restaurant than a traditional cafe. As I intended to take the coffee to go, I had to give my order to the unfriendly maitre d' (you can't even really step into the \"cafe\" if you are not getting food)  2. The coffee was expensive ($5 for a Cortado and $5 for the larger cold brew). I am willing to pay for coffee because I enjoy a good cup of coffee. But it was really not that great. I had Cortado that was tastier and, even in San Francisco, cost only $3.50. If you are already in the area, yes, perhaps try this place out. But if you are a visitor (like me) who is in town and craving a fantastic cup of coffee, don't bother going across town just to make it to Makers & Finders. It is not worth it.",

Perfect for locals and tourists who want a more low key/local spot to enjoy away from the strip!  The place makes their own syrups and have an amazing lavender latte... swear it's the second best I've tasted ever (next to steel town cafe located in Pittsburg, ca)  Other highlights:  - puppocino- $3 drink for dogs (basically whipped cream) - Happy hour (4-6pm) and $7 breakfast special before 7am - A pretty cool cocktail menu for a coffee spot - Latin influenced meals  - Outdoor seating/patio with couches  - animal friendly  - Friendly crowd (a lot of Californian transplants of course)   Note: - I'm pretty tiny so their serving size for the Latin hash was perfect for me (must add hot sauce!), but if you want a more hearty meal for $11 - you might wanna look elsewhere!",

This area is around hipster shops!   Great service and great food! Calling all my vegetarian people out there to give this place a shot! It is a struggle looking for a place that has vegetarian food that is as tasty as this! You have to try the Arepa Benny Vegetarian style! I felt like i was eating real meat. LOL! Hopefully my body doesn't react bad to it! The Soyrizo Brussel Sprout was tasty as well! Seasoned with vinaigrette and so much more! My favorite drink is the Lavender Infused Latte! This drink is like crack.. Well for me at least. I used to come by before school and grab this drink to keep me going.   I'm also not quite sure why this place is $$ when it's pretty cheap and it's the typical price as every other place!",

I had an idea of what I wanted to try but I looked at the menu for a while because everything seemed so delicious. I had the arrepa benni because I was there for some morning munch downs and it was so delicious I can't wait to bring my so here. Paired with the black beans and two delicious Bloody Marys (so damn good. second one came with chicken skin. sorta similar to chicharron) I was definitely in a good mood. Classic English breakfast with a Latin flair and it was amazing. I am impressed by the vegan options, just another reason to come back and bring my gf here. Cant wait to be back.",

I'm not big on coffee honestly my partner is but man am I glad I ordered this.   Sea Salt Caramel Latte (4.5/5) I added extra caramel and salt  I really enjoyed this drink. I can't wait to go order my new favorite coffee drink :) Service was really friendly but a tad slow for how not busy it was.

I'm just getting back from Seattle where coffee is around every corner but really good coffee shops in Las Vegas are a dime a dozen and there are few that offer food that matches the quality of their drinks.  I've been here numerous times now, to sit in/out, and take out and I've pretty much know exactly what I want now.  The Smoked Lox (salmon bagel), and a cooled off lavender infused latte.    I love salmon bagels and the one they have here I have to say is one of the best I have ever tasted.  And for your lavender latte, let it cool a little bit before you burn your tongue and can't taste any of the lavender.",

The hostess never gave me a menu upon sitting down and I wasn't acknowledged by the barista staff until I purposely stared at them. I was finally able to get my order in. Durning my wait, a friend of the barista came in and was promptly made an espresso shot. The food (Latin Hash) came out before my coffee was even made. Three bites into my food, I discover a long strand of hair. Management was notified and was apologetic about the issue; the bill was subsequently taken care of. I believe there is a reasonable expectation that every guest be treated the same whether you are a new face, friend of an employee or usual guest. In regards to the food, mistakes happen, however it was just another hit to an already disappointing visit.",

    "text": "I went here with my friend for the first time and she was raving about the empanadas. I tried the beef, chicken, and shrimp one. The chicken one was by far the best. The shrimp one lacked flavor but the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Their empanadas aren't the traditional kind and I couldn't pinpoint what the... casing (or dough? the stuff that held the meat?) was but it absorbed a lot of oil and it did not hold in the meat well. They're made to be eaten immediately because they get soggy and gross really fast. But those weren't bad. The empanadas are $4.50 each so be weary of buying them individually.  I got a big plate which had pork belly (amazing), the tiniest ribeye ever (like a quarter of an inch thick and it was cooked well-done [eww]) with some nice tasting chimichurri, an egg, rice, beans, and plantains. It was around $18. I like being able to try everything and since the serving sizes were smaller I say it was pretty good. I wouldn't get it again though.  My friend and I tried 4 of their drinks. I got the matcha iced latte with coconut milk which was nice. Nothing to rave about. I enjoyed their hibiscus iced tea more which was really pretty. My friend got the white chocolate iced mocha latte (I think?) which wasn't too sweet, which was perfect. She also got the lavender fog at the end of the meal which was really good. It'd be perfect for a chilly morning.  The bathrooms were shared with the place next door. It was kinda gross in there. The soap dispenser was broken and there were plastic tampon pieces on the ground. People need to clean up after their own messes. You nasties. (Not the restaurant people, the people who leave bathrooms a mess!)  Sorry, I got a bit off track. The aesthetic of the place was very trendy and hipster. It was really cute. They have photos for sale in the hall on the way to the bathroom. I didn't catch the name of the artist, but they were really nice. The employees were really nice and laid-back, but not to the point where it was unprofessional.",

That's how good the coffee is! One of the baristas mentioned they're learning to hand roast their own beans? Something along that line? Either way, their coffee is sourced locally!

    "text": "I was going to write a pretty bad review about our experience at Makers & Finders, fortunately the manager did try to make up for our lackluster experience. In all honesty I'm hoping today was just a bad day for them.   My family and a few friends dined here for a late brunch this Sunday, we were a party of 7 plus two kids. The place was pretty packed, but that's to be expected on a Sunday. Finally after sitting down we ordered, everything was going fine until almost an hour went by and still no food! We actually noticed that no one else in the restaurant had received any food either.  Clearly  there was something going on in the kitchen. I get it stuff happens but when dining with kids we all know how hectic it can be, and the need to get food in a timely manner.   I would've appreciated if the waitress had come over and explained what was going on, and offered us something for the kids but that didn't happen. I had to flag her down and speak to a manager to finally get food on the table,  which took another 15 minutes! I find that ridiculous, I am a former server myself, so know how important hospitality is!  It's important  to explain  what's going on to guest, and at least asking if she could get us anything in the mean time.   The manager did apologize about the situation, and finally we were able to get some food  on the table, still only my daughters meal and our appetizer. The food was a bit of a disappointment to say the least.  My daughter's pancakes were burned,  my boyfriends eggs were runny,  the bacon was not fully cooked. My girlfriends meal was cold, and everyone's  food came out at different times. It was all one big mess. I myself, order the short rib hash, the potatoes were salty and it needed two eggs rather than one. Once again we had to complain!  We did come to find out that there was a new cook, so the kitchen was pretty backed up all day. I wish we knew before we sat down. The Manager took the pancakes, eggs, and bacon off the bill, which is to be expected.  It was nice of him to send over two complementary desserts, and a bottle of champagne, for those drinking. We all appreciated it so thanks!!  I hope in the future they get it together, service is so important, especially if you want returning customers.",

For it not being very busy, I didn't appreciate being skipped for seating, Waiting to still be seated that I had to ask, Waiting another 10 to order. Having to ask the host for condiments since I can't find the server. Finished our food and waited way too long to be comfortable that I got up with our payment to pay anyone at this point since I can't find the server, Again.  Food was good. Not worth the wait. Service should be as good as the food.",

It was different then we are used to, but still good flavor.  I do wish the egg had been on top and I could have chosen the cook.  We like runny eggs and the bottom was an egg patty.  I loved the black beans in it though.",

The coconut/turmeric coffee wasn't good, the combination of flavors were a bit off on that one !  The restaurant is situated in the art district so it was lovely to sit outside and people watch. Plenty shade also, so it was pretty comfortable.  Service was a little rushed, and messy but I was a good experience overall.",

I also ordered the Sofrito burger. The burger was also good. But the server initially brought me out the wrong order (tacos) after waiting 20+ minutes. I told him to cancel the burger but it turns out the burger was just a couple minutes more.   I like the place but hope the service is better the next time I go.",

There's also a better than expected food menu.   My favorite drink is the cold brew. It's just coffee with your choice of milk. They have several non dairy milks. It has almond, coconut, and some others. It's about $3 for a regular. It also has a good amount of food. There's a few vegan choices here too. I like the chia oatmeal. It's about $5. This is a good light meal without sacrificing taste.   It has a nice atmosphere. It's located next to Hop Nuts Brewery. These share the same bathroom, which lets you move between each without going outside.",

There are two different meats options you can upgrade to and our waitress suggested the chicken. I think I should've gone with the other one because I didn't find it to be super flavorful. Also, they asked how we'd like our eggs - I said medium. It arrived VERY well done. I would've mentioned such a thing to our waitress but, we'll, you guessed it, she disappeared and we were quite hungry after already waiting longer than expected.   Oh! We also ordered a side of bacon that was never delivered but still ended up on the bill. Just one for thing for me to track down the waitress about. So frustrating.",

We opted for the croissant sandwich, tres leche waffle, London fog iced, and honey latte. Nothing disappointed at all.   Interior is modern. Plenty of booth/ table seating.

    "text": "So we were driving through Vegas and wanted a cool place to fuel up that wasn't on the strip. I searched through Yelp and found this place, which I saw had a ton of great reviews and the food sounded amazing. We parked right across the street and got seated immediately. Throughout our entire meal, we did have great service and were well attended to.   I ordered the lunch empanada bowl and subbed yuca frites for the beans and rice because as a kid I remember my mother's cuban friend making amazing yuca frites. These definitely didn't live up to the ones I was thinking of, but I can't fault them for that, just wanted to give my mindset. I chose the short rib and tinga empanada: really liked the chicken tinga, really was not a fan of the short rib. But both by the end I was feeling like they just were covered in sauces, and as the saying goes, if covered in sauces its not about the ingredients and meal itself. After getting my bowl I realized how greasy my entire meal was- the empanadas were overly greasy (yes I know they're empanadas but I still felt a lot of oil) and similarly to the yuca frites. I wanted to have something light as well, so I ordered the asparagus later, later to find out its drenched in oil- like literally drenched. It wasn't super well cooked either, so just overall not a huge fan of my meal.   My boyfriend ordered the Latin hash- and totally was underwhelmed. He said the ingredients came together as a mush, and it was just an overall salty flavor which he had to drench cholula in to give a different taste. He did order the cortado and enjoyed that though. Both of us at the end of our meals were still hungry and paid $12-13 dollars for each (not including the asparagus I ordered) and not including tip.   Overall, cute vibe but the food did not meet up to the expectations at all. The staff was attentive and nice, but they couldn't make up for the food.",

Unfortunately, my server forgot to put in my hibiscus mimosa order and came back 20 minutes later asking if I still wanted it. We ordered the tres leches waffle as an appetizer since we'd been traveling for 12 hours and were hungry but everything we ordered came out at once. I'm not gonna lie, I bit into that waffle and it was amazing ... until I found a long hair in the compote. I was so grossed out and of course our server was no where to be found AGAIN so thankfully the hostess was able to help us. The manager or supervisor introduced himself and offered to give us a new waffle to go free of charge - of course they put the the same compote on top and I just didn't even want to try to eat another waffle with that hair because I'm sure they didn't make a fresh batch right after we all found the hair. The mimosa was very refreshing. If you're going for a champagne brunch,  I wouldn't go here for fun. I went here bc they have plant based options advertised - I got a mimosa simply becauSe I was in vacation and I'm glad I did because it was my favorite thing at the restaurant. The rest of our food was good but it's hard to enjoy a meal when you just found hair in your first course ya know.",

The Eggs Benny with Hollandaise (modified from the red sauce) and the Avocado Relleno (w tuna and capers)... really?? This spot is a dream come True! Thanks Makers! Keep up the great work!",

When I arrived, my friend and I were deciding if we wanted to sit at the bar or outside, well the hostess decided for us by saying she would find us a table. No one came over for at least 10 minutes. The hostess came back and stated, \"I'm doing my sidework because I'm leaving but I'll get you your drinks\". After another 10 minutes or so, she came back with our drinks and told us she was leaving and this guy would be in charge. He didn't introduce himself to us or check back with us even after 30 minutes. We were on a time crunch after all the delays. So we both got out our wallets. That got him coming over.  My Lavender iced latte was good, but not good enough to put up with that service.",

It would've given us the option to make a decision to not even walk in.   That being said, we were told we would have enough time to drink our coffees in house.  Hostess let us sit outside and brought us water. She was very pleasant and made recommendations for something we've not tried. The coffee came back shortly after,  which we drank quite quickly. When you know you're on a time constraint, you try to get out asap. Both were very pleasant,  but since we felt rushed, we really couldn't enjoy the flavor.

We've only gone for late lunches (between 2pm - 5pm) and each time was quiet with only a handful of people, there was no wait to be seated or to place our orders. Not much items to choose from for happy hour but we were able to try what we wanted in the one visit, so that cancels out if we will order again.   I would come back here more for the coffee than the food. I'm not saying I would never eat here again or the food is terrible, I just wasn't blown away by the food like I thought I would be. I would definitely be open to trying new dishes the next time I go though, so there is still hope the food could wow me! I'll say this though, if you're a person that wants the fancy shmancy crazy flavored/blended coffees, this is not the place for you.  For drinks I ordered the cortado, which I thought was a nice blend of espresso and milk, not overly strong. My boyfriend ordered a speciality coffee cocktail, the espresso martini. He really liked it, I found it a bit strong (liquor wise) for my liking but I'm a lightweight and don't like to taste it in my coffee.    For food we ordered the 2 house empanadas (shredded beef & shrimp), the Latin poutine, and the sofrito burger. I found the empanada crust to be more pastry-like, very flaky and a bit messy which I am not used to. Also, the shredded beef was a little hard to eat. One bite and all the beef came out. I basically had to bite through the wad of beef in my mouth and cut up the rest to place back inside the rest of my empanada.  The Latin poutine was so so. I'm Canadian and I'm used to the scolding hot gravy that burns your entire mouth off and cheese, lots of cheese! The gravy was luke warm with barely any queso or cotija cheese as it claimed. It was basically fries, gravy, an egg, with bits of bacon. I didn't have high hopes for the poutine anyways. I find it difficult to get a decent poutine here in Vegas, but curiosity always gets me when I see the option on a menu. As for the sofrito burger, nothing bad to say. It was a good burger made with Angus beef, very flavorful and juicy. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.  All in all, I do enjoy the atmosphere and the drink selections and will be back to try some more.  I just discovered they are opening up a location in downtown summerlin (when exactly I am not sure), but this will be much more convienant then driving to the arts district and looking for parking!",

Her eggs were fine, but the bacon she ordered was burnt to the point of inedibility. The side of potatoes was very cold and soggy (ridiculous considering the $4 price point). As always the coffee was delicious, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed this visit. I would like to see more care taken with side orders. I myself have experienced the cold side of potatoes in a previous visit.",

I personally loved the coconut turmeric latte, it was flavorful and inventive. The food is Latin- inspired dishes. We especially enjoyed the chilaquiles and empanadas.",

They served the lattes in mason jars but if they aren't going to add an extra shot then they should get smaller mason jars bc I'm not a cow man.   The food was yummy. Sliders and fries for the kiddo, I can't recall my dishes name but it had mango. I wanted the plantain chips and it was served with only 2. What's that all about? I need a crunch with my meals homie!   My friends dish was good too, sorry I can't place the names of anything.   It felt like we were in LA.

I also genuinely felt like every food item on the menu was about 2-4 dollars over priced. 10 dollars for a bacon egg and cheese bagel is ridiculous. And it was very average. All and all the environment is cool. Staff was friendly. But would not want food again. 3.5/5.",

It made splitting the bill so much simpler!  From the photos on Yelp, I was expecting heavy, basic Latin American twists on traditional American brunch items. It was far from heavy and basic, the food was just enough to get us full, clean-tasting and incredibly fresh. I only took off one star because we ordered a lot of the eggs Benedict dishes and the eggs were all fully cooked. We we're disappointed when it wasn't at all runny.    And for me, the flavors of the La Paisa lunch item fell flat after a few bites. The server kindly suggested his favorite Salsa Verde which definitely saved the dish for me. I did not take off any stars for this because it is personal preference.",

My husband had their breakfast dish with Tinga and I had their popular hash dish. They were both really good I just wish the food could have been a bit warmer. Kinda felt like it had been sitting out for a while till they brought it out for us. Also taking one star off due to the length of time it took for us to receive our food(we went on a Tuesday and it wasn't really full with customers). Also I had ordered my latte and the server forgot about it! But still loved the place and will for sure come back! They also have WiFi and an outdoor area to relax and get some work done.",

As we walk in a server says she has to go inform the manager that such a large Party has come in.  Things were good till Faith the server approached us. She asks if we are aware of the complications they have been experiencing today not being afraid to show her frustrations. We unaware of anything let her know that we've just arrived, and another server was helping us with our ten top. She then Proceeded to say in a fashion that implied 'I do not want you here' that the internet was down and they now have to hand write their orders. She then told us that it would take an hour to seat us and even longer to receive our food.  Being very frustrated with the way this woman spoke to us I stepped outside to speak with my friends and inform them of the situation. My wife then followed me outside and told us that faith had said \"Today is the kind of day we wouldn't be afraid to turn away a ten top.\"  This is now why I'm writing this review, after serving for 10 years I have never seen such a poorly communicated situation to customers. If we had been kindly informed that the wait time was long and systems were down. I would have said thanks for letting us know and left thanking them for not wasting our time.  We will never return here and I hope you all work on your systems and processes.",

The only downside is accessibility to the restaurant. I was able to park a block away and that was no big deal but my mom had to park 2 blocks away and she has bad knees and can't walk long distances.",

I found it on yelp and decided to give it a try and it was a find! I was feeling adventurous so ended up ordering a coconut turmeric latte to see what all the hype was about and it was beyond my expectations. I ended up dragging my husband back there 2 more times and was disappointed that I wouldn't be able to get this drink until the next time we go to Vegas.  If anyonr knows where I can get a good turmeric latte in L.A. or O.C. let me know!",

It's completely flushed with light due to the large windows in the front of the shop. They have enough tables inside, outside, and at the bar/counter for you to sit at.   The staff is super friendly as well. They are always willing to have a genuine conversation.  I ordered the Honey Vanilla espresso. On the menu it is described that it comes with a cinnamon crust and a vanilla mist. (Your server actually comes out with your drink and mists your coffee with vanilla. Super cute.) It was definitely made well.  They have a full lunch menu here that I have yet to try but I definitely recommend to check this place out.",

They have such a beautiful space with unique artwork and quirky touches such as neon lights and mason jars as spice holders.   I went for the lavender infused latte and the arepa benny and both were so flavorful and delicious.   The lavender in the latte was strong in presence but not overpowering, and not too sweet.   The arepa benny blew me away. I had never had a Benedict with a Latin American twist like that. Pretty sure I blacked out from happiness because before I knew it, it was gone. My only tiny wish is that the eggs had been more runny, but that's just personal preference.   Will definitely venture off the strip for this next time I'm in Vegas. So worth it!",

The servers are very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive. They have an indoor and outdoor sitting area and cool with dogs outside as there were people there with a very friendly pit bull. Lots of Latin influences including Cuban coffee. They have a brunch menu and soon will be opening for dinner I learned from the waiter. The only downside was the shared bathroom with other stores but it fits right in with the overall atmosphere of the place. Also they give a military discount. Can't wait to come back here again!",

    "text": "Being a downtown resident, and a fan of M&F coffee, I brought a friend visiting from Los Angeles to a Sunday brunch here. Man, oh man, was it an embarrassing representation of local dining in Las Vegas. Although the restaurant wasn't busy, it took our waiter more than 15 minutes to approach our table. Once we submitted our coffee order, he assured us that he'd be back to take our actual order.   Sure enough, he did return, 20 minutes later, sans-coffee, to ask what we would like to eat. He was cold and abrasive, neither of us felt comfortable enough to ask for recommendations and he certainly was not offering them.   I ordered the salmon benedict. It came out cold, but our server didn't follow up until he dropped the check...so no hopes in sending it back to be reheated.  I'm *ALL* for supporting local businesses, especially in Las Vegas, but not for the sacrifice of service. There are plenty of other local eateries in the downtown area with ample service - check them out before you make the mistake of dining here.  I would, however, recommend stoping in for a coffee! Cute aesthetic, great for Instagram, full bar and lots of interesting drinks to try!",

After trying a couple other places downtown that happened to be closed (stupid hours), we came upon M&F Coffee.  It's a restaurant but also has a \"coffee bar\".  Our order was simple, 2 iced vanilla latte's to go.  Now understand, I am a coffee snob and in turn, my husband is too all because of lil ol' me.  Our drinks were poured over crushed ice (awesome in my book).  The presentation was great too.  Milk and vanilla on the bottom, espresso on top.  They mixed easily as we walked back to our car.   The drinks were awesome.  I opted for half the vanilla flavor they typically use as I don't like my drinks overly sweet.  It was perfect.  The hubs felt his was a bit sweet for his taste.  The location and parking are ideal.  Just South of Charleston on the West side of Main St.  It's like a half block before Casa Don Juan.   Prices were a bit steep.  We paid over $12 for 2 larges.  It's expensive but I guarantee, we will be back!!   Do yourself a favor, try the food but definitely grab a latte to go or better yet, have one while you eat and take one home too!  I lamented on 4 vs 5 stars because of the price.  I decided they deserve a full 5 as the drinks were just that good!",

So if you don't have all day and the patience of Job then don't go !!!",

We had Chris G as our server and he is one of the best servers I've had in a long time!! Very much enjoyed our experience at M&F.",

It's very cozy and the coffee was the best I've ever had in my entire life!  It was a coconut, turmeric, cinnamon flavor.  They have a very desirable list of beautiful coffee drinks including beer, cocktails, etc. the service was top notch and the food was so delicious!  It's definitely a gem and has its own very unique appeal!!!",

    "text": "As Las Vegas locals and servers my boyfriend and I love Makers and Finders. One of our favorite places to get coffee and brunch/lunch. However, our last experience was very disappointing. Our server visited us a total of three times in the hour and a half we were there, neglect is the only word I was use to describe her service. I ordered the Croissant sandwich with fries and he ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich. When the food came the croissant sandwich was delicious! I highly recommend it, as for his chipotle chicken sandwich I cannot say the same. There was way too much chicken and it was flavorless, literally just tasted like dry chicken. On top of that both halves were so soggy it was like biting into a sponge. I gave my sandwich to my boyfriend and placed his plate in front of me waiting to hopefully order something different or at the very least just have it removed. The sandwich sat in front of me the entire time not being touched and she never even checked in to see how the food was once. I finally had to wave the very nice hostess down through the window and briefly explain the situation, then gave her the plate and asked for the bill. Our server then showed up and dropped the bill without saying a word and from behind me leaving me with no chance to politely point out a few things. When I saw the sandwich still on the ticket I then flagged the host again asking to speak to a manager and possibly get the sandwich removed as we did not eat but two bites. Our server then dropped the new bill without an apology or even explanation. No manager ever visited the table, I glanced inside at the host stand before we left to see what looked like a male manager (I could be mistaken) talking to the hostess. It would have taken a minute to walk outside and apologize and at least leave us with a better taste in our mouth then we were left with.   That being said, we will return because every experience leading up to this was amazing and I still love the food and exceptional coffee. I am hoping this review serves a purpose and these issues are addressed and fixed.",

    "text": "Less of a coffee shop in the Starbucks or Peet's sense than a full sit-down restaurant that happens to have a coffee bar, Makers & Finders offers inexpensive Latin-inspired fare and is a solid downtown venue for brunch and light bites.  The arepa benny, for example, is a nice twist on the usual eggs benedict by incorporating arepas as the foundation for the poached eggs, all while adding rubbed beef and spiking the hollandaise with salsa verde. There is also a variety of coffee drinks served or prepared in different ways, whether pourover, French press, siphon, or espresso.   While the venue might look like a humble storefront like many others along this particular street from the outside, there's lots of space inside, whether at tables with folding chairs, or a living-room-like area towards the rear. Overall, a good attempt at creating a cozy, community-oriented gathering spot.",

Parking was on the side of the street, and had a two hour limit from 8am-6pm.  I showed up at the shop with my friend around their opening time at 7AM. There was a cute patio area at the front of the shop that I would have loved to sit at but it was a bit chilly today. We walk in & I noticed they had a hostess stand.. But no one working at the stand. It was different because I've never seen that at a coffee shop before. The space was bigger than other shops I've been, which is pretty nice because by the time we left at around 9AM, it was getting pretty busy.   I ordered a Mexican Spice Latte and an Omelet Pericos to go with it. I was completely satisfied with what I got. It was delicious. Except I paid $5.50 for my latte which was served to me in a normal sized mason jar and thought, wow that's all I get for what it costs?!   But besides that, my experience here was great. Service from our server Josh was good too! He was helpful and made suggestions and explained things they had on their menu. This is a place I would come back to and visit.",

For our drinks, my girlfriend got an iced honey cinnamon latte and I got the Lavender Fog. Both were perfect temps, respectfully, and my tea was exquisite. For food, which was hard to choose from a thoughtful and varied menu, we chose what seems to be a house specialty, the arepa benny. It is a really cool take on a traditional egg Benedict, subbing out the English muffin for the arepa, a fluffy corn cloud. The proportions were perfect and it wasn't over sauced like many \"bennys\" can be. We also had the smoked lox. Perfect. Again, the proportions are what gets me, wonderful spread on the bagel, the capers and onions in good order, and great salmon. I also really enjoyed our empanadas; chicken tinga for us today. They were a crispy texture, almost like they were made of wonton wraps. Everything was awesome, including the service. Very, very happy I came here.",

    "text": "My friend and I drove all the way from the NW to try this spot. Based on the reviews I was eager to be amazed. I ordered iced London Fog which was a STASH Earl Grey tea bag in a mason jar with lavender and milk. None of the flavors stood out. Apparently it started as hot tea then ice was added to the mason jar glass. The melted ice watered the tea down and was served lukewarm. I expect iced tea to already be chilled so when poured over ice you don't water down the beverage. If this is the method they use to make iced tea then add 2 tea bags to the glass so enough tea flavor is released to accommodate the extra water from the melted ice. For $5 I want to taste the tea and lavender. For food I chose the Mango Aperas. What a disappointment! If the word mango is in the name of the dish then put enough mango in it to showcase it. I got 5 matchsticks of mango that measured about 1.5\" X 1/4\" thick. The portion of mango looked like there was only one mango left in the kitchen and they were using it carefully to last the entire day. The sliced thin tomato, and 3 slices of avocado hardly makes this dish worth $9! Considering the location and the neighborhood their prices are way too high for the portions. I left disappointed and hungry!",

    "text": "Alongside their signature drink, coffee shops usually offer pastries and small salads. You can find some of the same fair here but with a Latin infusion, and those dishes are only in addition to their Hispanic inspired cuisine. Actually, this flavor flair even blends with one of their speciality coffees, the Mexican Spice Latte, which is an artful mix of subtle seeet with a savory touch. It is a refreshing change that is one of the main features that sets Makers and Finders apart.   The service and warm reception is another important element of Makers and Finders' atmosphere. The staff is always curteous, friendly, and completely skilled and knowledgeable in regards to the coffee they brew. When I first arrived, I ordered an espresso, and realizing I was new, I was told, \"Just so you know, we serve doubles as the standard here. Is that fine with you, sir.\" Yes, yes it is. In fact, that is exactly what I want to hear from a coffee shop.  Makes and Finders offers a great environment for groups or individual dinning, providing a bar counter, formal seating, and open areas with large tables and lounging sofas. Additionally, upon request, they can serve French press coffee or stove top espresso. I will definitely visit with a group of friends some time.  Whether you are stopping in for lunch during the work-day, or visiting for a casual afternoon coffee, you will always feel comfortable, welcome, and pleased at Makers and Finders.",

    "text": "Short review: I love what they are trying to do here and the quality of their product is great. They seem to just have the typical hiccups of a newer place and that's ok. I think they're a great spot and I will be coming back.  Drinks: They have a great balance of variety versus over-abundance of choice. They have all of the standards that you would expect to find at a coffee shop, as well as choices that play more to their style (ex. the Mexican Latte). And while they do offer a good variety in drinks and brewing methods, they do not overextend themselves with choice and instead seem to focus on making a quality selection of drink. And, their sizes were great for the price. We ordered the Lavender Latte and Honey Vanilla Latte...both were delicious and the table-side drink spritz given as part of the Honey Vanilla Latte was fun.   Food: They have a good selection of food. Unfortunately, we were full and only ordered the Elvis Press sandwich, but it was awesome. I definitely get the sense that many of the menu items  were family recipes passed down and truly are comfort food.  Service: Make no mistake about it, when the staff was attending to us, they were super-friendly and helpful. But, it seemed like it took them a while to get to us. I understand how crazy things can get but it seemed like there were a couple of staff members doing some kind of work on computers off to the side of the coffee bar rather than helping guests. This was an early Saturday afternoon and still pretty busy, so I would expect an all-hands-on-deck approach rather than leaving several staff members to juggle the whole restaurant by themselves. I don't get too worked up over this because I am in the industry and I understand, I am writing this mainly for them.  Our server was fantastic (I am so sorry I do not remember his name...but I know what he looks like). He was willing to help us out, gave us suggestions and seemed to have fun with things. The busser checked with us several times and re-filled waters. And even the co-owner (if memory serves from the article I read) even stopped by and was very welcoming. Even the hostess chipped in at clearing our table and got us our check...though I felt bad for asking her for it.  Facilities: The place is well-organized, clean and vibrant. I dig the industrial, open-ceiling look that's popular right now and they do it well. They have a good amount of seating, both indoors and outdoors, and can accommodate big parties. I wasn't really a fan of the plastic seats they use, they weren't uncomfortable, just sort of gave an odd sitting position. but that's whatever lol.   Overall, this is a cool spot, I fully expect them to iron out their service and I will definitely be back again. I need to try me some comfort food while I hammer down another massive mason jar latte.",

Elvis Press is such a special taste. Bacon and Nutella plays magic.   The biggest highlight is the spicy mushroom empanadas. The kale is a little bit strong and bitter for us. However, it is very fresh and a good match for the fried mushroom pie.   Definitely recommend if you want to avoid overpriced buffet and have a try in exotic international cuisine. :)",

I spent 40 bucks on a burger where the patty was half the size of the bun and burnt plus a three dollar up charge for some obviously frozen fries that they couldn't even put salt on apparently, and then my girlfriends hash that was okay at best. Then 3 bucks for some shitty lemonade that tasted like powder lemonade, and then the chai tea latte tasted like shit too. Starbucks tastes better. If you want some good actual Latin food, head down the street to casa Don Juan. And if you want good breakfast go to Vickie's diner also down the street.

I recently got back to Vegas after spending a couple of years in Australia where I ended up becoming a coffee snob due to the huge coffee culture.  Now that I'm back I realize just how difficult it is to find a decent cup of coffee in the US.  Where most American coffee places fail (especially the chains), Makers shines. I'm so glad I have this little sanctuary that reminds me of Oz. Macchiatos and flat whites made in the right size and proportion!  I've also been able to try some of their single origin brews and they've all hit the spot.  Shout out to barista Sean for a consistently amazing cup of joe and the whole staff for taking good care of me.  Haven't had a chance to try much of the food yet but when I have ordered food they are more than happy to work around any dietary restrictions.  I also love the industrial decor, the neon sign and the patio seating.  Dogs are welcome on the patio.",

Great location, super walkable.   The issue is, every time I go to M&F, I wait. I wait a long time. We ordered 4 drinks this morning and waiting nearly 35 minutes to receive our drinks. I ordered a cold brew. Coffee, and Ice. Cold brew. I left after 30 minutes of not receiving our drinks because I had to go to work. 15 minutes later, my friend was delivered to me at work by one of the 3 others that visited M&F with me. There were 3 other customers other than my group in the building, and all of them already had their meals/drinks. It's not that the barista or waiters were wasting their time goofing off. It was just insanely slow.   Another incident occurred when taking a lunch break for coffee. I ordered a bagel and coffee and had to wait nearly 40 minutes for a coffee and a bagel (with no meat or cooked ingredients).   I'm not a fan of yelp reviews, because, Makers & Finders deserves a 5 star in EVERY category, except for efficiency. The food is perfect. Coffee is incredible.

    "text": "I've seen the other reviews and photos of this coffee joint and couldn't wait to try it.  Makers & Finders Coffee is located in the Arts District and the modern decor fits right in with its neighboring proprietors.  The inside is bright and fresh and the staff members are all very welcoming.  I had brunch with my sisters and we each tried a different iced latte.  We ordered the lavender infused, honey vanilla and Nutella lattes and were dying to take a swing from each other's cup.  We were all pleasantly surprised that each one tasted wonderful.  These alone would make us come back! Which is a good thing because the food we ordered we thought was good, but nothing remarkable.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche, Arepa Benny, the veggie bagel, & the Capirotada (bread pudding). When the food came out, no veggie bagel showed up.  Instead a second Arepa Benny was placed on our table. The ceviche has a couple of shrimp shell pieces left in the dish and the Capirotada missed it's mark with the orange marmalade on top.  With that being said, I would still go back for the coffee and maybe next time just some pastry.",

Instead, It was a restaurant where a pretentious waiter (complete with an attitude) wanted to tell me where to sit - really!, there's only one table occupied - There was a small area with two sofas for the chill crowd. Both sofas were occupied and I didn't want to sit in an uptight table alone. So, I sat outside on the patio.  The food was good, but it was expensive for the portion you get. The coffee was luke warm.  Too expensive and no communal feel - I'm still waiting for a cool coffeehouse to make its way downtown.  The Beat it still the best going and PublicUs loves itself more that this place does.",

The first time we just tried the coffee, he had a cold brew and I had their special latte of the day \"honey almond latte with crushed pecans\".  It was the most amazing latte I have ever had in my life. Creamy, nutty, and not too sweet. Would highly recommend.  We came back the next 3 days we were in Vegas. Mostly for coffee but decided to try out the Arepas for lunch. They were both very tasty and the plantain chips were delicious but it was a bit pricey for the serving size.   Overall I would highly recommend, especially the flavored lattes!",

I've always thought Vegas' local culinary scene needed a game changer. Makers & Finders Coffee is exceptional!

If you want a substantial meal to fuel your day.....try their Bandeja Paisa platter.....comes with grilled skirt steak, fried sweet plantain, over easy egg, avocado slices, artery clogging fried pork chicharrones, spanish style rice, and black beans.......and that is just the appetizer......J/K. Seriously, though.....this is my favorite dish!  Did I mention the awesome coffee maker??????  Will come again!",

I ask for a specific type of coffee, being a coffee place silly me figured they would be able to assist as I like coffee but I am not an expert. I asked for moka, the coffee that is made in the special top part pot, I am not sure if he or I pronounce it right. He ask what origin, which in turn I ask what's the best one.  He offered no assistance and seem like he had better things to do. He even turned me off of wanting by saying coffee grounds would be in my coffee, with no explanation to why. Just did not feel as if the worker was up to par as this place looks amazing for coffee. Now I will probably ever know because of the customer service experience or should I say lack of.",

Their avocado salad is really refreshing and tasty, the empanadas were flames and my crew really enjoyed the poutine.   We sat outside because it was warm but it got chilly pretty quickly so they turned on the heat lamps for us which helped a little.

Second the portions in relationship to the servings are terrible, they apparently think way to highly of themselves.   Now the food. I have never had such an underwhelming pile of disappointment placed before me. Took 2 bites and threw it away. I ordered an omelette with diced tomatoes, roasted peppers and cheddar cheese. I did not know you could roast peppers and remove all traces of flavor from it. I felt like I was chewing solid air. There is no flavor, variety, or even care put into this dish. Heaven forbid they be bothered to put even salt or pepper on their food. Next time I want a watery pile of mush, I will go to the store buy some canned vegetables drop in on cardboard and let it sit for a couple day.  I should of gone better food by going to the dumpster behind Dennys.    Too much money for overpriced garbage. I do not understand the good reviews. The location must look nice because they have no talent hacks cooking.",

The atmosphere is okay, I think it has potential for being a really really good place to hang out.  The parking in front is first come first serve.  I don't know if they have extra parking behind the building.  The shop is right off of busy Main Street not the best area either.  I like the vibe better at PublicUs but the food is better here.  I'm not into the sterile white tables and chairs.  It needs more character seems bland and ambiance is almost everything.  They are young so let's see what they grow up to be.",

I got the mushroom empanadas (I should of order 2 extra they are good ! ) but s little over price for what it is . My girl orders a veggie bagel for $9! Lol she enjoyed her lavender latte for $6 . I had the chai tea with almond milk :) everything was good the service was good and the location was fun. They have an outside patio and free wifi. Will come back when I have to meet with friends or having a meeting. Not as a personal place that've look forward going to .",

Service was fast and the staff was caring.  The food selections were great for everyone and everything tasted good (as far as all the dishes I sampled from everyone around me).

To be honest I was nervous because I was contacted by Omar, the manager because of my review (he was very polite & wanted to prevent the situation from happening again) so it shows that they care about their customer's experience. Very genuine people! When I went in I sat at the bar again & was automatically greeted by Ruben. I was super awkward since it turned out he recognized me from my review  But he was very chill & attentive. You can tell he was genuine the entire time. When Omar contacted me he offered me a free drink next time I came in but I personally didn't wanna bring that up  I didn't want anyone to know I wrote that review xD But nonetheless, Ruben comped my drink. I never even brought it up so I was taken by surprise. SO FUCKING SWEET! He apologized for my last experience which I didn't expect at all! Definitely give these people a try! They're worth it! P.S. I had the veggie bagel this time, AMAZING.",

Great food and great service.... Can't ask for anything more.   I had the Arepa Benny dish which was recommended by the waitress and it was perfect.  Thank you Yelpers!",

I was impressed by the understanding they had on the wonderful coffee world . Since that day I knew I wanted to be part of the Makers & Finders family.  As one of the owners of Sin City Coffee & Beverage I am always proud to say that they are one of our best partners. They perfectly portrait the same philosophy our company was founded on.  The environment, efforts and dedication M&F team members put every day is what makes this place to be considered one of the best Coffee/ Restaurant in town.

I love bringing my laptop and books here. My favorite drink is the salted caramel latte, iced, with an extra shot. Without the extra shot, it's too milky tasting for me. As for food, my favorites are the croissant sandwich, the grilled chicken arepa, and the lomo saltado. I love all these things so much I'd get them delivered to my work (through postmates) which thankfully isn't too far off. My only other wish for this place is that it was open later :( They close at 4 on the weekdays and at 3 on Sundays.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to have brunch here on Xmad Eve. The place was packed when we arrived and we were told it would be a 20min wait for table of 4. There were some seats by the front door so we decided to grab coffee and wait. It took 15 mins for us to receive our coffee (2 brews and 2 lattes), even though people walking in after us received their coffee upon ordering. The barista apologized when I finally asked, but it was clear they simply forgot our order. Then when we were finally seated, it took another 10-15 mins before a waiter finally approached us with water. Mind you, there were only a couple of tables at this point and most of the diners around us were finishing up their meals. I expressed my frustration to the waiter, and he was nice and apologetic while explaining they were shortstaffed due to the holiday. Fine, that I can understand but even still....We quickly placed our orders and the food arrived within about 10mins. As someone who grew up eating Latino/Hispanic inspired food, I must say I was not impressed. Food was mediocre, meat and rice not well seasoned at all, and beans tasted like they came straight out of can. What I enjoyed most was my side of maduros and yucca frites, but how can you mess those up right?. I'm giving this place 3 stars for ambiance and the coffee was good (when we finally recieved it), but food was just okay. I'm not even counting off for the poor service we received. Modern, cool looking space, but subpar food.",

It is the BEST!! The food is insanely delicious and the coffee, especially the iced lavender latte, is to die for. As far as the food, La Paisa Arepa is my go-to but the Arepa Benny and the Latin Hash are also amazing. Because this place is my favorite, when I decided to have my bachelorette party in Vegas, it was a no-brainer that we would come here. All my girlfriends raved about their food and coffee. We even had some lavender mimosas. Gah. Seriously, I almost hate them for making everything so perfect. Um if you guys decide to expand, please set up shop in East LA!   I also just want to give them a shout-out for being so kind to me and my friends. I get that bachelorette parties can be annoying to have in your restaurant, and some businesses treated us that way, which was upsetting for me as they were also places I put a lot of thought into picking when showing my girlfriends a good time. Makers & Finders though, you guys were awesome! You were attentive, funny, and friendly. Thank you for being a highlight of my bachelorette. And I mean it about it opening in Los Angeles! Think about it :).",

I was drawn to their breakfast, brunch and Latin food when I looked them up. The ambiance is casual but a bit hipster. Hipster or not, the customer service was good, they make you feel welcome and at home. We ordered the Latin Hash breakfast and the Bandeja Paisa Lunch. The Latin Hash had such an amazing flavor; the meat was tender and juicy. Potatoes and peppers were tasty with a little heat but it was manageable. The Bandeja Paisa was satisfying as well; it's a good dish to order if you're really hungry. Finally, I wanted to mention the cold brew coffee. The fact that I didn't veer off and order one of their many other coffee drinks is amazing, because I was VERY tempted. But their cold brew was smooth and flavorful, not bitter, nor an acidic taste. Because of this, I didn't use as much half & half as I usually would do elsewhere. The prices here are reasonable. A really good experience overall.",

The only issue I had was that I had to physically get up and go to pay because despite waiting and waiting, then asking the hostess to get our server for the check and leaving my card on the table no check was ever brought over. It was at near closing time and the place was clearing out so I'm giving a pass but it was definitely an error for a place that usually does everything perfect. Until next time M&F but please, take my money when it's time to go! PLEASE! :)",

The outer crust kind of reminded me of the McDonald's apple pie back in the day. One of those dishes you'll end up craving. The coffee was Rich the service was good all be it took a long time. Place was packed. We will definitely be back. My wife Ethel also loved the place.",

Breakfast empanadas were out of this world flaky light crispy and in an odd way the outside crust reminded me of the McDonald's apple pie that came in that little box. Coffee was dark and yummy. Service was kind and on point all be it a tad slow. We will be back . Been gone 10 minutes and I'm already craving those breakfast empanadas.",

It's located in the art district of Vegas, so it has a fun hipster vibe to it. The interior design was really cute and very photogenic. Our server was super nice and did a really good job on checking in with us and getting our food and drinks quick. I had the vanilla honey latte, and I'm so glad I did. It was absolutely delicious, might have been my favorite latte thus far.   We also tried the lavender latte and that was a great contender for coffee drinks. Definitely get off the beaten path of Vegas brunch and come check out this place, it's a quick Uber ride off the strip.",

The latte naturally comes with two espresso shots, I asked for 1 and received a cup of java with cinnamon on top. After I mixed it in and drank it, it was so creamy you couldn't even taste the tumeric.   The Latin hash came out on a skillet. Good portion and tasted like someone put care into their cooking.  Would definitely recommend as a must try brunch place in Vegas.",

We waited soooo long just to be seated in a table that was \"reserved\" and had been empty all along since we first got here. Seriously??? When I brought this to the hostess attention she didn't seem to care one bit.  Anyways we tried to look past the wait time and ordered some drinks which were good. We then ordered our food & maybe 20 minutes later received most of our food except one. We waited another 10 minutes and someone said it'd be right out. 3 out of the party we're done eating by the time the last plate came out so we decided to get it to go.  Honestly, everyone here was either running around or standing around. No one seemed to have a certain job to do and when we asked for a to go box and our check, one waitress passed the job on to another waitress. At the end someone else got us our check and our to go box. Definitely won't be back.",

I went with a friend on a Wednesday morning and there were only 2 other people eating inside but I counted at least 3 employees. We ordered a black coffee and a cappuccino and then asked for a moment to review the menu.  After a few minutes we then ordered some breakfast.  After about 10 minutes I asked the waitress if we could get the coffee as the barista was just sitting there talking with 2 girls who came in.  (Keep in mind I ordered a black coffee).  The waitress said \"our coffee comes from the bar\" and then just walked away without trying to get our coffees.    Then a guy comes out with our food.  I pointed out that we were hoping (and had asked) to have our coffees before our meal or at least while we waited to order.  He seemed shocked and kind of ran around to find out where our coffee was.  Then the waitress came over and said that the barista was out of coffee and had to make a new batch for us.  We ended up cancelling the coffee.  Listen - the food is solid but this is NOT a coffee shop.  They had no coffee at 8:19am on a Wednesday and it took over 15 minutes and asking 2 people for an update for them to make a black coffee... complete fail.",

We arrived around 12 and this particular location is a lot smaller than the Summerlin location I'm guessing. There was a 15min wait unless we wanted to eat outside so we decided to wait. We waited on the patio which is bigger than the restaurant but still cozy and inviting. Our server was Israel he was great and very attentive checking on us throughout our meal. We started with the shrimp ceviche with plantain chips OMG it was delicious. For drinks we had the black tea and beermosa very refreshing and equal parts of beer and juice. For our entree it was a tough decision trying to decide what to get since everything on the menu sound sooo good but we decided to go with the skillet chilaquiquiles and added short-rib and he had the veggie Benny (yes he is the healthy one). When the skillet arrived I immediately thought it was not enough food but I was wrong. The short rib was cooked perfectly with so much flavor and I loved how the egg was the base of the skillet. We had a great meal and I would like to come back to try other dishes. PS on Sunday's they close at 3pm so come early it gets packed!!!",

The dough for the empanadas is more like a puff pastry, and the filling-to-wrap ratio was a little too low. The bandeja paisa was A LOT of food and proteins. The steak was a bit overcooked and dry. It comes with a 1 inch-wide strip of pork belly, not to mention a fried egg and avocado, beans, plantains, and rice! Aside from the steak, everything tasted good, but it was way too much food.  The service is very friendly. I'd definitely return for the coffee!",

All the chips were soggy, I wish there would have been some crunchy chips in the dish as well. Maybe some sour cream and pico would have been nice as well.   It's a little over priced for what this restaurant has to offer. Especially for Vegas the prices are too much.   Cute atmosphere, located on a street with antique stores super cool!  Waitress was whatever a little too blah, she didn't try to rearrange the table even though I got multiple dishes. The hostess on the other hand was very nice.   The outside patio was cute.",

We ordered a round of Colombian pour-overs and one siphon. Great coffee but the siphon was $9 and was no better than a pour-over. We all ordered chilaquiles which tasted amazing and price/portion appropriate. Tip: if you're a coffee geek order some toast to be served with your drink as the flavors of food will overwhelm your ability to taste the coffee. The food is not super spicey but has a lot of flav",

So much so that I came here for breakfast twice out of 3 days while in town and will definitely stop in on future trips. I was in town for work and found Makers & Finders to be a great start to my day. The atmosphere is clean, open and welcoming. Their food and coffee were on point too.  I had their Chicken Tinga Benny and Arepa Benny, both of which were great. Their salsa verde hollandaise was delicate and flavorful. The rest of their menu sounds great too. I'll have to try their Coconut Tres Leche Waffle next time and since they offer it with the option of adding bacon, that should be a great sweet and savory combo. Their espresso was nice and bold and service across the board was excellent.  Definitely a go to spot to good food, great coffee, and fantastic service.  P.S. Super easy street parking right in front doesn't hurt either.",

Parking is scarce due to endless construction but if you get here early, you'll be able to park directly across the street.    I brunched here with my wife, brother and sister in law during the weekend and was impressed with the restaurant. They serve Latin Style Hash, Empenadas and of course coffee/lattes.   We were seated immediately and placed our order within 10 minutes.  Drinks came out quickly and food came out maybe 10 minutes after.  The ambiance is perfect for one on one conversations or large groups.  The decor is simple and eclectic. With patio seating, lounge seating and formal dining seating, this place has enough room for everyone.   Our coffee/lattes were perfect in size and flavor.   The service is prompt and friendly.  Drinks are refreshed, plates cleared and follow ups were frequent.  I'm glad my wife chose this place, as we were able to enjoy a delicious meal, lengthy conversation and a great place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  I'll be back for sure when we visit paradise again.  Kudos to Makers and Finders Coffee for providing a chill place to enjoy a chilled drink or two or three... Did I mention they also serve liquor!?",

Placing food and drink (bottomless mimosas) was quick however our food came in 60 mins after ordering and drinks 45 mins after. Everything was going decent until we were abruptly stopped by our waiter about an hr into our meal that \"the manager was cutting us off\" with only 2 drinks in our mimosas because a party of three whom was carrying non-concealed guns (yes I know it's okay in NV) made a smart comment to another waiter on how we were \"loud\" with that particular waiter making a smirk and saying \"I'll take care of them.\"  So without prior WARNING they stopped us (a minority group consisting professionals and paraprofessional Asians, Pacific Islanders, and African American), served us our $500 bill, packed the food immediately, and asked us to leave.    We were laughing and having a good time until racism hit.",

Our group of 11 had a reservation, however, when we arrived we waited for a table to be prepared. It wasn't a long wait so we were ok with it.  When we were seated, everyone at our table ordered bottomless mimosas. Though we were directly beside the bar, we waited over half an hour for our first round of drinks. When the drinks came, a few of them were incorrect. Knowing that our group was large, we didn't make a big deal of it. Our server, Marquee, brought the correct drinks rather quickly and he was very pleasant. Our food came about an hour after putting in the order with the first round of drinks. We were out as a group of close friends for a celebration so naturally, laughter and conversation a bit louder than average may be expected. If we were an annoyance to anyone, we were not informed or given any type of warning. Our server came to us about an hour and a half into our visit and told us that the manager is cutting us off from anymore alcohol. No warning or request to settle down.  It's safe to say no one in my group of 11 will be visiting here again. 4 out of the 11 are Vegas residents. We spent over $500 and I hope they appreciated our money, because they definitely did not appreciate us as customers.",

Or maybe there was no hostess as my server both sat people and took orders, maybe that's why it was slow.  As for my meal, it was great. Had the steak skillet, egg white skillet and berry waffle. Everything tasted great.  I'll for sure back for sure.   Went back 2 weeks later, same time. The service was better. Ordered the Latin hash... great dish. I'm going through the coffee bar menu also, there are a lot of really good choices. Still 4 stars. I still think they need to add a server in the morning.",

We met for a lunch date and it was a cute little spot with indoor and outdoor seating. We were greeted and sat within about 2-3min which was surprising because it looked pretty busy at the time we went. The service was great and the vegan empanadas were amazing! I tried the soyrizo and spicy mushroom the seasoning on the crust was perfect! The rice and beans that accompanied the empanadas were flavorful too! The food was so good I went back with my girlfriends after work on a Saturday for the mimosas",

The place is over staffed but this does not equate to good service. I hope for their sakes that it's just the one waitress with the problem or that she was just having s bad day.  Otherwise a nice little hipster place with service that is a bit too casual for my taste.

The perfect balance of espresso and floral sweetness. The baristas here are some of the sweetest people you'll meet. I strongly recommend coming to makers for brunch . If you don't have anything to do on a Friday night I also recommend coming here around 6 or 7pm for dinner and take a seat at the bar and chat with the baristas. Overall this place is worth trying out if you love brunch, coffee , cocktails, and Latin food.",

I have to drive a while to get there.  I never have had a bad experience here.   Today, I didn't know what to get.  I ordered the double  espresso and took a chance on some avocado toast.  Sounds like it won't be that great.  The waiter there was very attentive and the food came out on time but get this, the food was delicious.  I don't know what they do to make it so much better than I can make it, but it was very yummy.  I asked for scrambled egg instead of the way it normally comes out.  Then, when the waiter sensed that I was upset about the amount of the espresso (it just seemed like such a small amount of coffee) he replaced it.  That is going the extra mile to make me feel at home and that they appreciate my business.  This is a business that will grow.  They are getting it right so far.",

Where else can you find a Coconut Turmeric Latte? Lavender infused? The list goes on as their beverage menu is bananas.  You can order in and sit at a table or grab a stool at the bar. Whether you're there when the doors open at 7am or for lunch in the afternoon the menu is surprisingly large and full of flavor. The Latin Hash is packed with potatoes, roasted vegis, and pulled beef. Feeling like you need something lighter? The Egg White Omelet is fluffy and full of flavor. I highly recommend adding a side of bacon because, it's delicious.

    "text": "I had higher hopes for this place. The look of the cafe (restaurant? coffee shop? what is it?) is cool. They have a covered front patio with plenty of seating, which is a nice bonus. It's advertised as Latin American, but the only Latin feel I get is from the music. There were some Latin food options but most of it was too American-friendly when I'm looking for a Latin experience.   We were feeling more peckish than hungry, so we ordered the avocado toast, smoked salmon toast, and tomato soup with grilled cheese. Both toasts were perfect. The tomato soup had the consistency of pureed tomatoes and was served lukewarm. The grilled cheese was made with a croissant. Now, I'm a huge fan of croissants, but as a grilled cheese, it's not the best. Instead of a crispy bread with a soft center, the whole thing felt soggy and greasy. Then, when dipped in tomato soup (as is the tradition), it fell apart. Especially because the soup was thick. And finally, I ordered the Nutella crepe but never got it.  They also recommended the Beermosa to me. In theory, it sounded interesting. But to me it tasted like a sweet cough syrup. But that just might be me.  Now as for the service, it was fine. Our hostess/server was nice. But we were the only two people in the place on a Saturday night at 7 pm. It felt like they were getting ready to close (mop was out, cleaning the windows) and they weren't due to close for another two hours.   The espresso and coffee are good! And they have a walk-up window for coffee orders--so that's probably cool when you're walking around the area.  After this experience, it's hard to justify traveling all the way here for a second visit unless I happen to be in the Arts District.",

M&F had a $20 three course breakfast, including a latte, which was a great deal.  ICED LAVENDER LATTE: The way to my heart, served in a Ball jar. My server said this drink was best cold, and I have to agree with her. It was light and refreshing to prepare for the day's crazy heat. AVOCADO TOAST: Lightly toasted golden bread with avocado, tomato, and queso fresco. Avocado toast is a favorite quick breakfast of mine and I enjoyed this version. AREPA BENNY: Enjoyed this combination of flavors again, egg was perfectly poached, the arepa makes a great, solid base for this dish. Surprised I haven't seen more versions crop up around town. BIONICO SHOOTER: Essentially a mini-parfait, with Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, and granola, this was a nice bit of sweetness to end the morning meal.   I really like the trendy-cool but still cozy-local vibe this place rocks. Covered patio seating is available if you get there early enough that it's not too hot. There's bar seating with outlets if you need to multitask and get some work done. Bathrooms are in the back, shared with Hopnuts next door.",

I decided to write a review because this is the second time one of the staff has had an attitude towards customers. The first time it happened I figured it was a one time thing, maybe I'll have a different experience next time but nope! Perhaps better training should be required and a better screening process before hiring. BY THE WAY- thanks for putting bacon on the to-go order of someone who doesn't even eat bacon!!!! Wtf! Bacon on an item that doesn't show bacon in the menu description. GET IT TOGETHER.",

I've taken it to go, I've had it in the restaurant, either way it is delicious, refreshing, and made perfectly every time.  This cute little restaurant/coffee shop is located on Main Street, south of Charleston, so it is a little ways off from the many restaurant openings of Fremont. This makes the restaurant a nice retreat in the Downtown area.   As for food I have had the Chicken Tinga Empanads which are awesome. Perfectly fried with succulent, spiced chicken inside, served with a small bed of lettuce. I have also had their tomato bisque soup, which is creamy and bursting with flavor.  I will miss Makers & Finders for sure. I hope I can find an equivalent when I move to Texas.",

For a hot drink the Lavender infused is a cozy and decedent choice where as the honey vanilla is a bright uplifting cold drink. Also had to buy a shirt for my girl when we stopped here. They have a strong selection of well designed and manufactured t-shirts and tanks. Def worth stopping here if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "For a Las Vegas coffee shop this is as good as it gets. I do hate sharing my local secrets but its for the best right??? Makers and finders is right up there with Sambalatte battling for my coffee addiction. The location is in the arts district so unless you are staying downtown or near/on main street you will probably need a car to easily get here. Once you are here though, the staff is friendly, the coffee is amazing and the ambiance is well, hipster-esque. Me personally I am not a hipster but I don't feel really turned off coming here at all.  My favorite things here are of course the lattes, specifically the lavender latte or Mexican spice latte, and a few of the random food items they serve. My favorite will have to be the chicken tingas, which are basically homemade chicken enchiladas that come in an order of 2 and cut in half with sauce ON them. If you want them plain you better say something when you order. As for my second favorite thing here I would have to suggest the tomato bisque soup. Tastes delicious and looks homemade. As for the 'grill cheese' croissant that comes with it, I could pass, but that still doesn't stop me from ordering it!  I have been here many times, have tried about half of the menu and I must say I have never really been disappointed. My coffee is always amazing- keep in mind on weekends or when they are super busy, expect waits of up to 10 minutes for your lattes but it will be well worth it. I drive out of my way to come here. And will continue to do so unless they disappoint me!",

It's located off of Main Street (Arts District) by the antique stores and Buffalo Exchange...the cafe itself is a hidden gem, all the furniture and accents looks like stuff you see on Pinterest... It's definitely a Hipster cafe, minus the know-it-all attitude ..   Upon arrival we were greeted immediately and asked if we wanted to dine inside or on the patio, we chose the patio, within 5 minutes we were served fresh ice water in cute mason jars and offered the menu, the cuisine is modern Colombian and very tasty .  We're coffee aficionados and I was so happy to see cafe' con leche on the menu, if there's Cubans in Vegas you know how hard it is to come by an authentic con leche. I chose the Lavender Latte and I'm so happy I did...Wow ! It's the perfect balance floral and not to sweet .. It's not too subtle but all your senses explode !  Once you're done at the cafe, make your way around the Arts District and check out the Arts Factory and all the antique stores off Main St.",

Lomo: the beef was flavorful but tough, stingy on the onions and peppers, fries delicious (highlight of the meal), no jalapenos though the menu called for them, egg was done right, and rice was just meh.  For $14.00, the quality wasn't up to par and the serving size was disappointing.  Arepa: like the lomo, the beef was flavorful but tough, plantains weren't very good, pretty tough and flavorless, black beans were meh, avocado - stingy!  Avocado looked almost like garnish than part of the meal.  Overall, good, but not great, and for the prices, we expected more.  Without the automatic markup for being in Summerlin, this might be four stars, but for the quality and mediocre portions, three stars.  We hope their coffee will be better!",

I waited for about twenty minutes until an other customer sat out there as well, and he got served right away.  I gave the waiter a look and he realized he'd forgotten me, and was super apologetic. He promised to \"step on it\" and grab me a $3.79 cup of coffee to go, and was nice enough to bring the bill and take my cash off the table about five minutes before the actual paper cup of coffee ever materialized. A spoon or something to stir the honey would have been cool but the coffee itself was good enough I didn't end up needing honey, so at least there's that.  Whatever. Shit happens. I think what's going on here is that the brunch vibe is killing the coffee shop vibe, the model isn't really clear, and the service for people who think this is a coffee bar like it says on the sign is suffering.  I wouldn't come here again as if the place is a coffee bar, but know where to go if I need hipster brunch and a $4 cup of joe off the strip. Nice design. Chill location.",

Mango basil tomato balsamic is brilliant #Chef_whooo??? #jbo",

We had heard great things about their food and their reputation is correct.  The food is quite excellent. And the coffee, spectacular.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5-star review is that the wait staff is not informed of the menu.  I am not saying they should know how to cook but when I asked how many eggs to an omelet and was told six, I knew not to trust that answer.  I also asked what \"sofrito\" meant and one of the wait staff gave me a completely different answer than, I believe, the manager/ owner response (after I ate it).  So, management, please teach your staff how to answer questions and if they don't know, to go ask and not make up stuff.  I ordered the Omelet Pericos and it was excellent. The house sauce was sooo good, I wish I could have dipped the crunchy plaintain chips into more sauce...! Next time, additional sauce on the side, please.   My boyfriend had the Chicken Omelet Tinga. He is a picky eater and he said it was very good.  Lastly, the coffee, the best cortado I have had in this country, so far.  So, if you can overlook the misinformed wait staff, try M&F. Very good.",

Wait was a little too long for me but this place isn't really a big place and when people come for coffee they usually like to sit and talk for a while.   The caffeine was awesome. Nice selection. I decided on a Nutella latte which was pretty delicious. I really wanted to try the lavender latte but I thought that might be a little too daring for me.   As for food, I decided on the Arepa Benny. It's like Benedict. It was good but it really wasn't mind blowing. My friend did order one of their specials for the day.. I think it was called Mashed Yucca but don't quote me on it. That was probably one of the best things ever. My other friend got the empanada sampler which was alright nothing too special.   Both my friends got a Cordadito which was VERY strong. That may be a little too much caffeine for me and I took just 1 sip.   Overall, the vibe is very hipster. The location is in the art district which to me is very hipster as well. The staff are nice. I probably won't be returning just because there wasn't really anything special on the menu that I would want to come back for. None the less, I didn't have a bad meal.",

I read the reviews and I have to say that as far as the coffee goes this is a spot on place! I am a huge fan of the lavender latte. I have also grown addicted to their Mexican chocolate latte! The idea and the concept of the place is perfect for the location. I'm from Los Angeles so I'm used to places like Silverlake and Melrose. This place would stand among the best in those two areas.  The coffee, anything from the lattes to their special drips, are always flavorful and fresh and robust. The staff has always been extremely helpful and friendly. If there's ever been the slightest issue or mistake with my order, they have always been very quick to fix any kind of issue.  I've only eaten here once but the locks Benedict that I had was extremely tasty. I can understand some of the other reviews when it comes to price versus value. Everything seems to be made fresh and to order so I can understand the price point. You also have to look at the hip and trendy arts District that this coffee place I s in and understand some of the price is based on location.  I highly recommend any of their lattes and it makes for a great to go cup to walk around and do a little window or antique shopping in the area.",

Not my usual go to type of food in the Latin/Vegetarian variety for the most part, but still a nice change of pace for a brunch wth options besides eggs and hash. I had the lemon chicken plate and thought it was tasty but not quite a lunch you'd want on a weekend to detox from festivities the night before. It's a very good weekday lunch though, but a little much at $13.   I do believe this is some of the best coffee in town, however. Makers really knows their beans. I would come back for an afternoon coffee and to chill on the patio area any day. But Unless you have a hankering for Arepas, I might try another spot in the area for an amazing brunch meal.",

It has a variety of good options for those with dietary restrictions. There was no option for turkey bacon though for our kosher/halal friends.   I ordered the coconut turmeric latte with coconut milk. Absolutely delicious. Not too sweet where you want to gag, and not too coffee-forward if you are feeling a little fancy.   I had the salmon lox, it was very good. The cream cheese was very buttery tasting. It was beautifully drizzled with olive oil upon presentation. I would have liked to see a little more salmon on the bagel. Usually these bagels are loaded with salmon if ordered elsewhere.  Hubby also ordered the Omelet Pericos. This was an underwhelming dish for me, maybe because I hate green bell peppers. Hubby thought it was ok. He thought the the egg was over cooked and was expecting an actual sharp cheddar flavor. He says it tasted like American cheese. To him, it was an overpriced \"meh\" omelet.  The decor is great, but the service is slow. I think the hostess was in training. Waiter was great.",

It tasted like a stir fry with way too much oil. This place has a urban decor reminding me of a coffee house back home in Baltimore. My date said it felt like Seattle in there. Music was dope and the staff, very friendly. Love the ambiance and will be back with a new date lol. It's definitely a spot to vibe out or meet and greet.  Main Street has construction going on. They tearing up these Vegas streets, but still and all outside is so adorable you can easily ignore the grind of loud machines and a dusty dug out street scenery.",

I was so impressed with the large array of unique craft drinks!! From lavender lattes to \"matcha-chinos\", there was definitely a beverage that catered to every individual. These drinks were also beautifully presented and tasted wonderful which was the most important part. The food which was $7-15, was absolutely delicious and provided a lovely Latin flare that sets it apart from other breakfast joints. The interior was spacious, cute and had retro (70s-80s) music playing in the background along with a nice patio in the front. The only reason why I took off a star is because service was quite slow. We were the first group there, yet it took an unusually long time for them to take our orders and give us our food/drinks, so much so that we had to wave them down a couple of times. Other than that, I would love to go here again!",

Anyways I would probably never want to have coffee anywhere else. Haha It's the prefect spot to meet up with a friend and have brunch any time of the week.! I didn't have the food this time around but it looked just as delicious.! They have a location in Downtown Summerlin as well.!!!!",

It's more like a 4.5, but there really isn't anything wrong with it. Would I rush to go back? No. But would I go back? Sure. A good find, and we're happy we went.",

I convinced my lovey to go back a second day and also loved the Coconut Tumeric latte while we were there for breakfast.   Latin comfort food is definitely a plus in our book. Although, it is on the lighter side, not saying that in a bad way. We were starving by lunch time at the airport, so it makes for a good meal if you don't want to be weighed down.",

First off, the idea of a coffee shop mixed with Latin comfort foods is original and brilliant. And the menu is full of innovative combos and classic drinks. I ordered the cold brew, chicken tingas empanadas, and crispy fries to share with a friend. I was served pretty quickly, and the food was not only presented nicely, but it tasted just as good as it looked!  The exterior and interior of the shop is immaculate. Due to poor Vegas weather, I was unable to enjoy the couches and lounge chairs outside, but the thought is so inviting. The inside is beautifully decorated and a very comforting atmosphere. There's copies of literature and free Vegas magazines to read. There's an open area for laptop use. And there's your standard bench and table seating, which was perfect for my party of two.   The staff was very friendly and inviting! I never felt over serviced or badgered, which made me relaxed.   Absolutely a place worth checking out if you're a tourist or a local! I'll definitely be back. Often.",

I think those customers ordered the siphon coffee, but I ordered a French press at an eyebrow raising $5.50 (although, still $2 cheaper than the siphon). I would compare the coffee to the gas station coffee I've had up the street at Arco. I also ordered their lox and bagel (in photos), which was just kind of sad, especially at $10 a pop. Lox and trimming only included on one half of the bagel with a few tiny shavings of onion (which I don't personally have an issue with). If the food and beverage were half the price they ask, I wouldn't complain about the underwhelming quality.",

I also love how open for feed back they were on my visit, which if this is being reviewed by the owners can i beg for ORGANIC MILK?! No one else in Vegas is doing this, i would even be in for an up charge of 50 cents or so, optional or not.  I ordered the tomato bisque which was delightful, perfectly tomato-y and spot on with the black pepper. I really appreciated how understated it was, just simple clean flavors with no gimmicks. The croissant panini was a nice touch but could have been a bit warmer and i personally could have gone for a saltier cheese like a long aged cheddar or gruyere.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, especially the neighborhood vibe with the clean and lively interior. I know i will be returning several times before the grand opening.

    "text": "Found this place via Yelp, was excited given the positive reviews I read. Went there with the hubby and while our server was polite, the food and speed of service was sorely lacking. It was expensive for what it was.   Ordered breakfast items and they do not come with potatoes or toast or anything else--that cost extra. Portions were terribly small. The chicken tinga omelette was bland and really was only egg and chicken with the other ingredients seemingly just lightly glazed over the top - offering no flavor whatsoever. The Latin hash, described on the menu as 'pulled beef, fried potatoes and yucca, peppers, fried egg,' had zero yucca (red potatoes instead--so sad since I was really looking forward to this), over cooked egg, and loads of oil. The one redeeming factor for the hash was that it was somewhat flavorful. The latte tasted like burnt drip coffee not at all like espresso, and it was $6!!!! We left feeling extremely unsatisfied, still hungry, and grossly overcharged for the skimpy meal we had!",

Salted Caramel Latte $5.50 **  I can't even find the words to describe how amazingggggg the BREAKFAST BAGEL was!!! The best bagel I have EVER had- hands down. The KALE CHORIZO OMELET was exceptional as well! I usually don't like omelets but this one made me a believer. I also had the Salted Caramel Latte which we all know was amazing- can't go wrong with salted caramel :)  My man friend however really enjoyed the smoked lox bagel and the kale chorizo omelet. He also really liked the honey vanilla latte! 5/5 for us!!!!",

    "text": "Great place for coffee and a nosh.   My fave (so far) is the Mexican Spice Latte -iced, because it hit 112 today.  (Oh, Vegas in the Summer. You're like a bad relationship with great sex. We know that you're gonna bitch-slap us come July, but we just can't quit you)  ...but I digress  Service here tends to move at a fairly contemplative pace. But it's a fair trade. They don't rush you as you gently nurse your cappuccino, so give them a few extra minutes to make your lovingly and beautifully prepared meal.   The location is in the up-and-coming (i.e. Gentrifying) Antique Row. Very near great shops like Retro Vegas and Desert Buddha -and of course that perennial favorite, Buffalo Exchange (It's not a store, it's a lifestyle)   My only request: please add a few more vegetarian options to the food menu. Right now, I'm driving up from Henderson just for the coffee and the hang. I'd show up more frequently, (and spend more money) if there were a few more veggie choices.   Great Place!",

    "text": "Really like this cute, hipster cafe.  Concept is kinda odd, though - an espresso joint with Latin American cuisine and service at the table. That means it's not the kind of cafe often seen in urban cities that you sit down with a laptop and get some work done while sipping a nice cup of coffee and munching some pastries.  On the bright side, Makers and Finders serves better food options than a typical coffee shops. The Chicken Tinga was really good - crispy, thin crust with just the right amount of fillings - second to none in itself.  However, Ceviche de Camarones was a bit of let down - it's uninspiring and just too sour. I like sour Ceviche, but I failed to taste anything other than a bunch of lemon juice - my expectation was a delicate balance between sour, salty, and fatty.  La Paisa was good, but not as spectacular as Chicken Tinga.  The cappuccino was well crafted, not too milky and the powerful shot of espresso was present - comparable to Sunrise Coffee or Sambalatte. That alone makes M&F a great addition to the local coffee scene.  I'll come back and try more.",
