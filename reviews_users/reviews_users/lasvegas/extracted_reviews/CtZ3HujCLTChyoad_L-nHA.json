I always respect each individual style that a pizza place has, whether they are a classic, True to their culture nature of what they believe the perfect pizza should be or if they're a personalized, let's make it how you want it style of a venue.  The first time I dropped by a Pizza Rev, I was greeted with a, \"Finally! We've been waiting for you!\" But oh, did the ecstatic pizza artisan know what he getting himself into. I love the spiciest of sauces, every vegetable known to mankind, and I am super picky about supporting businesses that support my local community.  I introduce to you, as the pizza artist named it, \"The Veggie MONSTAHHH\" pizza. It's a mountain of vegetables, organic and as locally sourced as possible. My favorite thing to do is top it with about a gazillion (or maybe three or four) packets of crushed red pepper, but at Pizza Rev, I get most excited when I dive into the hot sauce bar!! Give me that Gaelic Habanero sauce, or for milder tastes, try the smokey Datil Pepper or the sweet Peach Vidalia.  They are always friendly, always energetic, and the produce you get from their pizza bar is the freshest that I've seen in town. Join their rewards, and you get sweet deals like 2 for 1 pizzas when you introduce your friend to their awesomeness. But until you join the rewards, enjoy Tuesday $6 pizzas and a happy hour with a beer or wine to go with your pizza. Oh yeah, did I mention that they have WINE?!  My only suggestions would be to create the spiciest hot sauce for me, and to put a local brand beer on tap.",

They said they \"take comments like this very seriously and will pass it along to the team.\"  I went back about a month ago and expected a different experience.  I planned on taking my initial review down and giving them kudos for listening to and taking care of their customer's concerns.  However, to my shock nothing had been passed along to any team.  They didn't clean the signs and there was still caked on dust above the toppings.  Floors were dirty and the place was just so unsanitary.  The area to get napkins and cutlery was also dirty and out of stuff again.  The toilet seat was still about to fall off and the bathroom was worse than the last time.  Unbelievable after the first review I left.  Management does not care about this place and how filthy it is otherwise they would've followed through with what they said.  Which team did they pass this along to?  I mentioned the bathroom to one of the workers and he actually went into the bathroom and fixed the toilet himself.  At least they have one good employee who cares.  Great concept for pizza but just a dirty dirty unmanaged place.  My stomach turns every time I pass this place.    Maybe management will take this review seriously this time so others can have a more pleasurable experience in the future.",

    "text": "$6 pizzas on Tues!  My favorite for this type of build your own pizza has got to be Blaze, but Pizza Rev is not bad. You do get a choice of their regular thin crust (which they call single) or their thick crust (double) for the same price, where Blaze charges an extra $1 for their thick, but they don't have as many sauce or topping options as Blaze. I'd stay with the thin crust though; the thick tastes like a good supermarket frozen pizza, not a brick oven or wood fired pizza.  Their spicy sauce here is inconsistent. First try it was noticably spicy, second and third time no spice at all. They don't offer goat cheese, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, pesto and a few other toppings that I love on my pizza, but bc of the $6 deal on Tues, we do still come here even though it's not on our part of town.  Be aware though, lots of people come on Tues esp during lunch, so expect a long line, and a tough time finding parking. This plaza is very busy, as with everything else on this side of town!   Pro tip: If parking is full, you can park on the street just behind Pizza Rev, or better yet, just go there first and skip all the nonsense in the parking lot altogether!",

Toppings are super fresh and service is friendly and fast. I can totally dig going here for pizza and beer, but until I'm no longer pregnant I'll settle for pigging out on some delicious pizza. They have their own combinations to choose from or you can make your own. The kids meals come with a smaller personal pizza, a dessert, and a drink. Great spot for the whole fam!",

Dude putting on the toppings asked me what I wanted on the pizza and I told him I ordered the margarita. He looked at me confused and said it was his first day and had no idea what a margarita pizza was. Most of the toppings looked like they had been there for quite a while. Basil was dried out, etc...  They were very skimpy on the toppings. My daughters pizza had all the toppings in the middle for some reason and they got the double crust and thin crust pizzas mixed up. For around $8 per pizza it would take me $30 to get filled up here. The thin crust is like eating air.  Won't be back.",

I sit at the bar and sip my free water, and after waiting another 15 min, I ask if it's done yet. Guy at cash register was having a hard time figuring things out.  Pizza finally came out.  Not sure if the staff were just having a bad day or if this location has gone down hill.  It wasn't like this the other times I came in, but I didn't order from the app either.   If they are going to offer online ordering, they should do better at getting the order right. I saved ZERO time using the app.",

    "text": "Just had lunch here with my husband and we both were a little disappointed in the pizza.   This is a casual, fast-fired, make your own pizza place set up similar to Chipotle/Cafe Rio.   They offer three crusts, thin, double crust, or gluten free. We both had the thin crust. It was comparable to a cracker. It was very thin, didn't fold well. Almost too crisp like an unsalted saltine cracker.  Sauces include red, white and bbq. We both ordered a pizza with red sauce. The red sauce is comparable to canned tomato paste that is watered down to pizza sauce consistency, which is not very good.   The cheese options is italian, ricotta, bleu, feta and low fat italian.   The selection of toppings ranged from meatballs to arugula and of course classics like pepperoni. I was looking for salami, pesto and roasted garlic, but did not see any.   They have tea and one of those soda selection machines. They also had hot sauce, peppers, cheese and oregano next to the soda machine.  Overall, the customer service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Service was quick and the line was moving. It is grand opening week so they were doing a charity event. Pizza was the price of a donation. There is outside seating and ample seatin indoors as well. They also have beer available. The usual price for a custom pizza is $7.99. They have a kids pizza as well.   I really tried to like this place, but after having Blaze Pizza, this place doesn't come close. Next time I'm in the area and craving pizza, I will head down the street to Grimaldi's.",

Today's visit, I had the thin crust, pink sauce (red and white swirled together), mozzarella, ricotta, pepperoni, and pineapple. The pizza was baked quickly, I barely had time to visit the freestyle Coke machine for an orange/vanilla Coke when my name was called and my pizza was ready. I like the super thin crust and I personally like when it gets dark and a little burnt. Today's pizza came out exactly like that. Staff member Kenny is super friendly. I think I made his day today by giving him my black Sharpie marker so he could write guest names on the parchment paper. (He was struggling with a pen so I offered my Sharpie, told him to keep it) I think the prices are very reasonable and the pizza is delicious! Service is quick, even with a dozen people in line. The restaurant is clean, music is not too loud, lots of windows to let in light and lots of available seating. There is a liquor license so one can purchase alcohol but I don't drink so I am not sure what specific alcoholic drinks they sell. I will continue to visit Pizza Rev, especially now with pink sauce on my pizza!",

    "text": "Ok...... My spectrum of Pizza places like this range from the Top ( Blaze ) to the bottom ( (  I'm sorry, Pizza Kitchen). Pizza Rev was a nice change. ( plus it's closer to my house than Blaze). Toppings were good and they had organic items. A real pizza oven cooked the items nicely. I just have a couple of points that you may want to consider.  1. People don't know to order the salad WITH the pizza. I ( and several others that I heard while I was eating) ordered it at the end when checking out. Not sure if you have a better way to streamline that. ( with that being said, the Caesar Salad  was very good, better than Blaze)  2. You shouldn't have 20 types of hot sauce on hand  and no salt at all in the entire restaurant. We asked everyone ( even the manager) and learned that there was absolutely no salt at all in the building. Get some good salt ( Himalayan or sea salt or kosher or whatever) and have that on hand for your guests, please. I literally drove to Farmer Boys to get salt and came back to eat my pizza.  Best of luck to you all. Welcome to the neighborhood.",

I think they could benefit if the initial person who asks you how many pizzas you're ordering also asks if you've been there before. If it's your first time, they should explain how you order.  Second, the dough sucks. Even with double dough, it was like eating a pizza on a tortilla. The vegetable toppings should be sliced thinner so that they can cook. Because the crust is so thin, the vegetables end up partial cooked, especially the mushrooms. The many variety of toppings is a plus.",

I am not allergic, only intolerant, but wanted to share that when I asked for gluten-free crust they were immediate in asking if it was preference or allergy, factoring in how much attention I needed. A lot of places dont know what GF means or get annoyed, which wasn't the case here at all.   I also loved that they have beef sausage and beef pepperoni as I love those two but dont eat them when theyre only offered in pork. Last but not least they also offered a spicy sauce which for me was the perfect balance of flavor and kick.   The service was very friendly but not cheesy and I really enjoyed it. They also have the fancy soda machine where you can get all types of different flavors. I was all set to go with my spicy, beefy, gluten free pizza with vegan cheese and cherry coke! How much more specific can you get?   :)",

    "text": "I definitely dig the whole idea of customizing your pizza and getting it cooked in an open fire pit! It's definitely adds a more nostalgic feel. Plus it definitely gives motivation for your kid to eat their customer made fire pit grill, or at least I would like to think so.   This particular location is located in a plaza, so you do have variety on what to eat, but none of the other places had pizza on their menu, it's also not too far away from the shopping center off of Rainbow, so if your looking to eat before you shop they this is your place to hit up when your craving some pizza. I do enjoy the Alfredo sauce option for your sauce choice. I get it all the time and add my veggies, it's as if I am eating pasta but instead of the noodles I have pizza dough. So I would recommend this place if your looking for something unique, because you can definitely add as many topping as you like or purchase a creation on their menu. My favorite toppings are artichoke,spinach,olives, and peppers.  My husband loves his massive meat and veggie toppings, my kiddo like his cheese pizza with different cheeses.",

If you've never been to Pieology, then it's very similar to how Chipotle runs.. and if you've never been to Chipotle... well then I don't know what to tell you.  Anyways, you have basically 3 options from the menu. You can: 1) make your own with unlimited toppings 2) select a cheese pizza or 3) choose one of their pre-selected pizzas.  I went with my fiance and of course we chose the unlimited toppings! I don't eat any pork, so I chose chicken as my meat. I lathered on Alfredo sauce and covered that bad boy in a bunch of veggies. The 'za didn't take long to bake, but I was fairly disappointed. I wanted all my toppings to be melted in and the mushrooms were that over cooked, squishy texture that I love. We ordered a side salad, which to be honest... could have been it's own meal by itself (KUDOS for that!) but it was simple.  I do have to say I love the decor and that they have a little bar you can sit at. Oh! Did I forget to mention they serve beer? Who doesn't love beer and pizza?! (Unless you're under 21, then that's a no to you, you youngins!)  All in all, this place rated about average for us. It was delicious at the time, but I was starving. But I definitely won't be returning anytime soon. Throw me a $5 pizza from Lil Cesar's any day.",

So,  although they are not my favorite pizza spot,  their attention to customer service today was great! Everyone's tastes are different,  and they do have vegan options.... I would recommend giving them a try!",

There is no distinction between meat and no meat utensils or understanding by the majority of the staff unfortunately. There was one staff member that was very understanding and helpful on this matter. The only other matter is that our pizzas were to go. Smelled delicious!!!  Unfortunately when we got home to dig in, the crust was not completely cooked. Yuck. Had to put it back in the oven. So much for a quick pizza. Super bummer.   My note to the owner, please take the next step in the thought process and provide Vegan only utensils. It would be much appreciated.",

Who doesn't love the classic combination of pizza and beer?! Plus they actually have a bar area with a couple of TVs to watch a game. This chain skews toward a slightly older crowd than the other family-centric chains.  #2 Their service is hella friendly. Like, Brandon and I could legit be friends. It's not just greeting everyone and smiling, the staff along the assembly line make genuine conversation.   #3 They have constant promos and discounts! Mondays 4 can dine for $40, including pizzas, salad, drinks, and dessert. Tuesdays, their usual $8 pies are $6. Downloading their RevRewards app gets you an instant freebie. It's like they actually want you to come back!  #4 Their product is pretty good. You can double up on crusts for a thicker hand-tossed version, or pay $2 more for GF. They aren't stingy with the toppings. Vegan options (daiya) and seasonal specials (roasted brussels sprouts!) are available. Food comes out fairly fast and it's more than enough for one meal.   As long as PizzaRev's around, I'll be coming back every couple of weeks. But I wouldn't complain if they made a location about five miles north...",

    "text": "I'm kind of torn about this place. There's good and bad, but the bad is really a deal breaker.  THE GOOD: The place is cutely decorated, the staff was friendly, the ingredients seemed fresh and they even catered to vegans. The prices are also pretty reasonable for a personal pizza with unlimited toppings, and the pizza comes out super cute and Insta-worthy.  It's everything I want in a restaurant except, you know, the bland tasting food.  THE BAD:  I know what you're thinking, it's a personal pizza place. If I didn't like what I got, it's because I built it wrong, right? But the problems with the food were the fundamental parts like the crust, the sauce taste, and how how they cooked it.  STRIKE 1: The pizza crust is flattened with a machine. It's pretty common practice in personal pizza joints since it probably keeps prices down and it's fast, but it's not as good as hand-tossed. It lacks the right texture, and basically becomes a cracker.  STRIKE 2: The sauces, both white and red, were very bland but somehow distinct (and not in a good way). It tasted like it straight out came from a Ragu jar. Not even the immense amount of garlic, spices, cheese, and toppings could mask the taste.  STRIKE 3: Lastly, when it was time for baking, the process left the bottom of my pizza crisp and burnt, but my mushroom toppings still raw. I'm sure it's hard to formulate the perfect time for all the pizzas, but it's not quite perfect. It half-assed both when it should've full-assed the crust. If the toppings were skinnier, it could've done both. Instead, it did neither.  OVERALL: 2.5/5  They have decent pricing, great service, and a nice environment. I really don't like the food though. For two people at a normal pizza joint, it's the same price for a large, hand-tossed, cheese pizza. And it may not have as many toppings, but toppings, arguably, do not make a good pizza.",

Both spots were good, both boasts fresh ingredients, both are priced around the same range, both are quick to cook.  This place was kind of lacking cleanliness tho. Me and my kid went here after the trunk or treat event last night and a bunch of tables were dirty. It looked like they had a slim crew because the guy who took my initial pizza order doubled as the cashier which is at the end of the ordering process. But either than that nothing really different. Their kids meals does have healthy options of if your kid wants to live dangerously they can get oreo cookies instead.  Again, nothing really bad about this place. Food was good, service was ok and they have those kewl coke machines.",

The guy handed me the pizza, failed to tell me it didn't have truffle oil on it and I asked and he said no.  The cashier tried to give me cash and I said no I want it refunded on the card.  Then they didn't even apologize.  The manager went to argue with me and tell me I have to understand that they opened in May and are still working out the kinks.  Sir it's November.  You've been open for half a year.  He then hits a few buttons on his screen and says \"looks like I learned something new today\" after telling me there's no way to process a refund in the system, he processed a refund.    He went on to crumble up the paper and didn't apologize or show any genuine interest or sincerity.  I work in hospitality and food and beverage.  If you just opened a month ago this may cut it, not after a half of a year.    I won't be back and wouldn't recommend anyone to go here.  Pay a few extra dollars and dine at Grimaldi's.",

The guy in the front of the work line making the dough ( which by the way was way too thin) he looked absolutely miserable. You can create your own or pick one from their menu. Same price no matter the toppings. Sounds great huh? Well when the pizza was done cooking, the veggies were still raw and it was just really gross. The dough was so thin that loading more than two toppings makes it really heavy on top of a thing dough. FAIL! It's a huge disappointment because like I said the concept is great and the look of the inside and outter building is visually appealing- but the food was gross.  I left this same exact review on Facebook and I had two people be extremely rude to me and talking smack to me personally( I don't know them). Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.",

I came in a couple weeks after opening. They seemed to have it pretty down. You walk up to the line and start with the type of dough. You can choose between thin, double, or gluten free. Next you pick the sauce. The choices include red, white, BBQ, or olive oil. After that you can pick your cheese, which include Italian, reduce fat Italian, feta, blue, ricotta, and vegan. After that you can pick your proteins and veggies. They have so many options I'm only going to list a few. They have sausage, pepperoni, spicy pepperoni, bacon, pineapple, sundried tomatoes, and basil. I really liked the idea of them building the pizza and throwing it in the oven. The beginning of the line was really nice and helpful. They helped me with my questions and kinda helped me decide what to get. Then end of the line wasn't so nice. I felt like I was being rushed to decided what to drink and not helped. I sat down and waited for them to call me for my pizza and I watched the line. I don't know if it was just me put it seemed like the staff didn't get along. I got my pizza and wished it was cooked a little bit longer. They have a free style coke machine which is always cool but I went with a beer. Overall a OK experience. I want to go back and try some different pizzas.",

Jk it's an extremely diverse group that shows equality and fairness for all. When you walk in the door all the employees spontaneously burst into song and dance routine that looks like they've been practicing for months. Jk but they do say hello. And combined with the smell of pizza, its essentially the same thing. Trust me I'm a Doctor. (No I'm not) but I do love pizza. And the pizza here is really good. call me Dr. pizza lover trucker. Jk dont call me that my name is rasputin(no its not) its no of your Business. but this business on the other hand (whichever hand you are not using)is great. 10 stars jk 5.",

I made it with alfredo sauce, cheese and nothing saucy or juicy whatsoever. The rest of my family made really good pizzas though.  The dessert pizza was by far my fave.

You can also easily customize all of it.  I asked for the Mediteranean pizza but with red sauce and pepperoni and onions added.  Lol it was great and they gave me a free soda that day.  I was real disappointed that they did not deliver as their website was leading me to believe.  I actually took an Uber there and back because. I don't trust Uber eats and 3rd party food drivers.  If I owned a restaurant I would want my food delivered by one of my employees that I know and trust and that I can control them showing up in a clean shirt and clean car.  Just sayin'.

Give him a raise lol. Usually people like him aren't recognized by the company or management. I'm not sure if he was the manager or not but he was so fast and efficient. There was some kid he was working with that seemed like he didn't want to be there but Josh still carried the team on his back. The kid might've been new and overwhelmed I'm not sure but Josh definitely did such an amazing job with greeting customers, making pizzas, registering, and serving the food out to tables. He checked up on us twice as he was passing by. I hope he gets some recognition of this review!",

Very delicious pizza. My kids always get their Oreo dessert pizza. Our  pizzas were great. They run a Tuesday special of $6 pizzas.  They also serve beer and wine :) all $5 and under by the glass.

The crew working tonight are lazy and don't care. I ordered my pizza and waited. The two guys in front of us got their pizza and finished eating. I walked to the counter. The cashier looked at me and he could see I was getting impatient asked me for my name looked at the next box and said it was mine and will be ready soon. A couple more orders were called and I finally went up to him and he rolled his eyes and said it will done soon.  He then saw two boxes sitting on the oven looked at who I guess was the manager and tried to blame the person running the oven after he lied and said my pizza was next up. I brought a friend too that loves pizza and told him how great this place is. Well we ate our cold pizza and left.",

From the line worker who put mozzarella cheese on my pizza prior to even asking what cheese I wanted.... well sorry hate to break it to you but I'm lactose lady. And unless you think it's faster to pick each piece of cheese you so graciously threw all over my pizza... welp. Then I'm going to have to ask for a new one. As expected, she rolled her eyes and gave attitude. Got to the cashier and he was even worse! He was wearing a different shirt than the other line workers so I'm assuming he's in management? News flash for anyone working in management. No matter what kind of day you've had, you never put that on your customers. This guy threw our pizza and yelled across the room for us to come get it. And repeatedly did similar things to people in line in front of us and behind us. Micah was the name on the receipt. Won't ever come to this location again. TERRIBLE SERVICE. By the time my pizza came out I was over it. Go to blaze or mod pizza where they actually care to accommodate their customers. :)",

There are a lot of different \"build your own\" pizza restaurants nowadays, but this one has definitely surprised me. The staff at this location is really nice and if I were in the area, I'd come back again.  I ordered one Double Dough Craft Your Own Pizza with various toppings.  DOUBLE DOUGH PIZZA (4/5) - A good personal size for a great price - Crust wasn't burnt, which is a flaw of a lot of other places - Smaller variety of toppings than I expected - All ingredients tasted fresh and delicious  One reason why I liked this place so much was because it was so cheap! To spend less than $10 on a meal anywhere is a steal. If you've tried the likes of Pieology and Blaze, I would come check this place out. It definitely surprised and impressed me.",

    "text": "So I've been here before and loved it so we came back.  It's been a while (my nephew , who lives out of town, remembered and requested it ).  Any way we were greeted by a little man who spoke very softly and I had to ask what he said a few times.  I ordered a pizza , a dessert pizza and i wanted a salad.   I was asked what kind of salad and I answered.   When he started adding things I never asked for i said I don't want any of that (the girl in front of me was picking her toppings) the male employee said \"I can't edit it in any way \" so I said never mind already frustrated with how hard it was becoming to get what I wanted.  Dessert pizza I had to ask for 3 times.  Still no one acknowledged.  They were calling wrong names while I stood there.  No one directed me or said a word on what to do so i just moved my way down to the register. I said something about the salad because i didn't understand why i could order a make your own salad.  \"Oh that's a build your own salad\" I said that's what I wanted ! At this point I quit.   Charge me for the pizza , dessert pizza and a couple sodas.   Zero appetite and only anger now with the absolute zero knowledge of what's happening behind the bar.  These employees are walking around like they are lost.  I sat down.  Out comes some random salad that is given to me.  \"I didn't order that \" he says \"oh you didn't ??\" Again. Lost.  My name is called for my pizza and guess what.  It's not my pizza.   My name is under it but it's not mine.  A few minutes later my pizza comes out.  No plates.  Nothing.  I'm not even gonna eat.  Annoyed and done.  I will not be back.  Ever",

We come here when the kids ask for it, but my hubs and I opt out and pick up food from neighboring restaurants. My kids enjoy it, that's fine. My personal gripes are the pizza crusts are way too thin and often served crunchy and I always feel like something is missing no matter how much toppings or additional flavors I add. It's just not the fast open-fire personal pizza spot for me.   Today, my daughter's kid size heart cheese pizza looked like it was just tomato sauce pizza with small cheese topping. Disappointed. I may have to deter my kids from here and drive the extra miles to Pieology or Blaze.",

But unless you're obsessed with all natural, organic or whatever the trendys like these days then by all means this is your place if you're willing to forfeit taste. It wasn't the worst I've had but it wasn't really anything to rave about. The topping choices weren't really that great and when the pizza cooked it bubbled up and spread most of my toppings either off of the pizza or to one side. The semi burnt bottom on the pizza turned out to be what turned me off most. It was hard to bite through and no one likes tasting burnt dough.   As for the service it was nice all aside from the blonde with the pony tail at the register. She seemed like she could not care less about her job or anyone she came into contact with. It's strange, her words were nice, but her tone, face and body language said otherwise. She didn't even look at me once through the entire interaction.   Overall I will just stick to the Pizza Kitchen on Ft Apache.  Sorry guys!",

    "text": "Oh PizzaRev... I wanted to like you.  The concept is fantastic, the execution and the quality were just terrible.  I would have given you 1-Star but your staff was extremely friendly and had an excellent attitude, even though they could use some serious courses on efficiency and processing of customers.  First - there were 6 people in line ahead of us and it took 15 minutes for them to be processed through the line.  Second - after it finally got to be our turn, our \"prep person\" kept getting interrupted to do other tasks.  She was extremely friendly and had a great attitude and was fun to work with in line.  In fact, ALL of them were.   PizzaRev, you have a great staff... get your act together and give them the help they need to be efficient.  Third - the pizza is just BAD.  The red sauce has no flavor (the white needed extra garlic) and the ingredients were bland.  The sole exception was the sweet fennel sausage.  Now that had promise there just wasn't enough of it.   We had both the double dough and the single dough and both needed a bit more cooking as it was chewy and spongy.     The ingredient selection was fine, but I think they need to be a bit fresher to get more flavor.     If you are looking for cheap pizza, and the cheap taste to follow it, this is the place for you.  I don't think we are going to return as there are many other great places to eat pizza... but if you are looking to staff a restaurant... go check out this group.  They are awesome.",

More than just two sauces, or two cheeses, even. (Go for the spicy red sauce and the mozz.) Other go-to toppings include roasted garlic, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, basil, and, naturally, bacon? Well, that was my husband talking. He also gets the double dough crust. My 5-year-old actually finishes his food here as well. Pizza, applesauce/oreos. Yea, kid-approved. I guess my only complaint is sometimes it can be chilly in there, but then again, with an open-fire oven, that's nice.",

Pizza Rev is the first one I've gone to since I discovered the greatness, but I feel like it wasn't quite what I wanted.   The girl that greeted us was friendly and informed us that the thin crust is very popular so we opted for that. I'm one of those people that love to fill the pizza with everything that looks delicious. I feel like I didn't get that much, but the thin crust still didn't hold up. All I added was sausage, onions, feta, cilantro, and mushrooms, with pesto at the end. The pizza was hard to eat. My boyfriend and I split it, but picked different toppings. I somehow ended up with only 2 pieces with my toppings, HOW?  The staff was nice and the restaurant is clean. I would come again if I had a craving, but sadly it won't be my first choice.",

The dough, which I got \"double thick\" on a margherita base was about as thin as a frozen tombstone pizza, with about as much flavor.   The sauce didn't stand out as anything special which is why they offer you a dozen different bottles of hot sauce with which you are supposed to \"rev\" up your pizza.  They have about 40 ingredients to pile on and doctor up the mediocrity. I usually create an un-harmonious mix at these joints because I'll eat anything but this time I used restraint and went with some meat, ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes.   Of the 3 occasions I've hit a new and trendy build your own pizza establishment (Blaze, etc.) this experience was least memorable.   Thank god for the hot sauce.",

You choose the crust, sauce, and toppings, then when it's cooked head on over to the hot sauce bar and add some sauce to \"rev\" up your pie. I like that the pizza's come out fast here, but I do think they could use a minute more to crisp up the toppings.  The crust is always super crunchy which I love, but the toppings are barely cooked. They also are super skimp on toppings unless you ask for extra. The classic pizza I ordered had 5 pieces of pepperoni on it. I guess that is their recipe, but even Domino's will cover the whole pie with toppings.    I do like that they offer beer and wine here, and they have specials different days of the week. I am also a fan of their app, where you can earn rewards towards free food, and you can order ahead. This comes is handy when it's busy during the lunch rush. My only gripe about the app is there is no way to add double toppings unless you type it. This could easily get over looked so it would be better if there were a way to put how many of each topping you would like.",

    "text": "Today I ate at pizza rev. I've been here before and I love it because when the husband and I are both craving pizza we usually want different toppings but when we come here we can both get whatever we want!   Today I was especially impressed. The staff was super friendly and welcoming upon arrival and they got our pizza out in a timely fashion. I don't know the names of the staff that were working today but while we were dining I noticed a woman outside struggling to help another woman with a knee brace into the store. It was clear they were having a very difficult time making it from the car into pizza rev. Upon seeing this struggle, a few of the staff members ran out to help and literally helped walk the woman in by holding her up and supporting her. They sat her down at a table and then brought her a menu so that she wouldn't have to go through the line and told her they would bring the pizza out to her.   I was genuinely impressed by their willingness to help not only their customers but also just a woman in need. It always helps to restore faith in humanity when you see such caring and respectful young men stepping up. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you pizza rev for the pizza and the touching moment!",

However, I do take some responsibility for the final product because I was unaware one could ask for more toppings, if wanted, so not knowing that I ended up with about 4 pieces of sausage and 5 mushrooms.  I also was unaware there are different crusts, so we all ended up with thin (which burned). Not sure why we weren't asked which crust we wanted?  Anyway, lessons learned.",

You can add any meat you want at no extra cost the only thing that cost more is the gluten-free crust. I made an Italian pizza and it was heaven. All of the workers were super helpful and very friendly and professional. I will definitely be back because it is so close in my area and I recommend it to all of my friends.",

He represented the brand very well and educated us on the product in process. Others in my party had been to other PizzaRevs before but did not know there were other opine for the bread. The manager explained everything. I would definitely come back to this location and recommend others to try it as well.",

    "text": "Completely upset about this experience,  I went on a Friday at lunch and when I arrived there were only two customers in line.    I placed my order with the dough person, then waited for the next gal in line to do the sauce and cheese process, she apparently needed more experience. It took her FOREVER to do the previous order of three pizzas and finally she started on mine, someone came from the back with a call in order and she stopped mid sauce on my pizza and started that order of 3 pizzas, all the while the rest of the crew waited for her to finish the sauce and pizza process so they could place the toppings and hand the pizzas to be cooked in the oven.  The next few employees in the prepping line looked rather anxious as the line began to build, finally my pizza was pushed down to the next guy and given to the oven guy, relieved as I have only an hour for lunch, I paid, got my drink and began waiting for my name to be called.   20 mins passed, I began to become anxious, I asked the guy working the register, \"how much longer\"  to which I was told they'd call my name when it was ready, I explained that  other people who had placed their orders after me were eatting, asking  him to double check. he  replied, \"we're a little busy!\" by then the line to order was to the door. Another lady came up, asking about her order also upset, finally my name was called! Only they weren't giving me the right pizza, so after another few minutes, apparently it was decide...my pizza was accidentally given to someone else. A male manager came over to the register, began to issue a refund for my pizza, handing me the cash and never apologized or anything. Needless to say I was upset that I was still hungry, late back to work and had been treated poorly.   If this is the new revolution in pizza, I think I'll pass.",

Delivery person no apologizes and seems like she doesn't work for the restaurant. She said she doesn't have receipt and she doesn't know anything about the order! try to call them and 10 mins nobody answered the phone. Unbelievable experience with them. I don't know how their delivery system work but it's the worst delivery experiences in my life. Don't you have to check the order or confirm with the delivery person?? two times wrong order and missing order..with about $12 delivery fee! Now we have to drive there and find out WHY.",

There were only 2 staff that I could see there & they were busting their humps waiting on the long line of customers.   Sitting down having my pizza, I glanced at the receipt & realized I was charged for an extra pizza. I waited in line to discuss with the cashier & he said he has no authority to fix the issue but his manager was taking someone out for a 30th birthday lunch & would call me in the afternoon to refund me for the mistake. A week later, no call from the manager so I called on my way over there to get some lunch. The manager wasn't there again. The employee told me to call back or stop in another time. I explained that I am the one who is inconvenienced & the manager should step it up & call me back or better yet, mail my refund to my house since I don't expect to come back to this PizzaRev due to the poor customer service. The employee said the manager will be back in 15 min & will definitely call me. Fast forward to the next day, still no call from the manager to refund their mistake.",

Ironically, it was the pizza I ordered for myself which was a cheese pizza with thick crust. Somehow they managed to not only make it thin crust, but there was bacon, sausage, and pepperoni on the pizza. I'm extremely annoyed with this because I waited about 30 minutes to get these 4 pizzas and to drive back to work and have 1, mins especially, be COMPLETELY wrong, is frustrating. Not only that but I couldn't even eat the pizza because I don't eat pork. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Pizza Rev, think of it as Subway or Chipotle, only with pizza.  As you work your way down the counter, you select each component of your pizza.  There are various options for the type of crust, sauce, cheese, meats, and vegetables.  They even offer gluten free and (more recently) cauliflower crust.  You can choose between one of the \"our way\" pizzas (like BBQ chicken or skinny margherita) or you can \"craft your own.\"  You can even make your pizza half one thing and half another.  Pizzas only come in one size,  which is bigger than a personal pizza, but not quite large enough to share.  Standard prices include a thin crust and all other crusts involve an upcharge.  In addition to the standard assortment of beverages,  beer and wine is also available (happy hour = half price drinks from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. daily).  Salads, desserts, and kids meals are also available.  Additionally, orders can be placed online.  Environment is casual and clean.  Pros: With lots of options, there's something for everyone; you could eat there every day and never have the same pizza.  The pizza oven provides the crispness and flavor that adds something to any pizza.  Pizza Rev makes a nice lunch or quick weeknight dinner.    Mehhh: The pizza was tasty enough. The employees were nice enough.  Not sure if that's enough.  Cons: The least expensive pizza and a drink (for one person) ends up being $10 to $11; this can add up quickly if you bring a family.  Also, the fact that the standard pricing includes a thin crust, rather than a traditional crust, seems a bit deceiving.  Speaking of crust...there's fine line between crisp and burned; we got a little of both.  In a Nutshell: The pizza is tasty, but so is a frozen pizza.  I would go back, but probably not frequently.",

Whenever I go I usually go to the one of Rainbow and the 215 it's always very clean and the pizzas taste great! Yet today my experience was not too good I was getting a pizza with a friend and when the employee started to do the cheese there was lots of spots without cheese and we both asked for more several times but that didn't seem to be priority of the employee. Now I'm not asking for loads and loads of cheese I'd just like it to be a thin layer across my whole pizza at least and I don't think that's too much to ask for. Yet when we finally got the pizzas about 25% of it had cheese on it the rest not so much! In conclusion I'd for sure come back I'd just have to say I was disappointed in the quality of my food this visit!",

My visit this evening has just not sit right with me. First off, they were out of water cups at 630pm on a Sunday, right before the dinner rush. Instead of kindly informing us the cashier / \"manager,\" Dominic was rude, short, and unaccommodating. This sorry of excuse dilemma is probably the biggest problem Dominic has experienced in his life, as he is extremely out of his league managing a fast food pizza joint.   This was poor example of leadership at this location. He didn't apologize for flipping a pizza over on the customer in front of us, undercooking pizzas, or take control of the situation in a manner that reflects well on the PizzaRev concept. What's unfortunate was that he took this approach to all the customers who were before or after us. There was nothing but unhappy customers in the place and he did nothing to help remedy the problem. The food is great but the service was absolutely terrible. PizzaRev needs to reevaluate there management hiring skills because, if this is there best to offer, I can be certain this will be a failed model of success by the chain.",

That's fine if you're into that, but...  Now, they're also restricting their toppings. Oh, they'll throw a little more cheese on their very small initial offering, but that'll be an extra charge.  Too bad. This used to be a good lunch spot",

I ordered a simple two topping pizza, but their regular size orders are the same size as a kid's order at other restaurants. The pizza barely had any cheese or sauce. You could see the dough at the bottom. The service was not very good. The worker asked me what my name was and verified how to pronounce it twice because they call out names when the order is done. She still said it wrong. I know that may be a minor thing, but it contributed to an overall poor experience. I don't believe I will be returning here.",

    "text": "I am writing this review after I have been to this location specifically 5 times. Each time I have had a good experience, would gain a star. Only 1 time did I have a decent experience.   1st experience. My friend brought me here, after already eating, I only got a side salad. Easy enough to say that it is ridiculously hard to screw up a side salad. The experience was fine, my friend had a good pizza. We were all good.   2nd experience. Here is the worst of the worst. Me and two friends ordered online for delivery. EVERY SINGLE PART OF OUR PIZZA'S WAS WRONG. Not just like \"they forgot the bacon.\" More then half of each pizza was so wrong we couldn't tell who's was who's. We called and they said that they would re do all of our pizzas, however we had to come get it. They wouldn't deliver. OK.   we get there and it was a mad house. This guy was THROWing toppings AT the pizzas. Whatever, it was messy but free. conclusion? WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T ORDER ONLINE  3rd experience. I went on a slow night. trying to get a small pizza close to my house cheap in and out. Took my wife, and she is basically a toddler that only eats Hawaiian pizza. a two topping pizza is 5.99 on their menu. I order two Hawaiians and mine which was a signature crust and a build your own at 7.99. Tell me why the guy rang me up for 3 pizzas at 7.99 and when I said \"um arent two of them supposed to be 5.99?\" HE THREW A FIT LIKE AN ACTUAL TODDLER AND ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME.  4th experience. This time I come in, and when I would ask for toppings the guy would pick up the wrong one and I almost wanted to come back there and make it myself. I said Sun Dried tomatoes.. he grabs regular tomatoes.. I say basil.. he grabbed arugula,, I said minced garlic, he grabbed mushrooms. Like dude. what the heck man.   5th and final experience. This one wasn't nearly as bad as the rest, but it will make it my final time ever coming to this place. A friend wanted lunch here and was buying. I offered to go and get it. I ordered like I normally do. Its not very busy, meaning no-one ahead of me and one person behind me. There was a fairly new person doing toppings, but was awfully slow. And could only focus on one topping at a time. Nevertheless, new people need time to learn too right? Meanwhile I was waiting to pay. and I saw the man behind the counter, Micha talking to a customer who ordered a cauliflower pizza I guess she didnt get it and she was pretty upset. Her mom also had a huge issue with her pizza and a refund was issued. Then I notice the woman behind me got her pizza first. Hmm... Weird. Whatever I just wanna get my pizza and go. Then the woman came back with my pizza. Oi.. I got that one and noticed that it was missing the basil pesto I ordered on it. Then I got two more pizza's. I told the guy one of them was the other lady's. Naturally my second also didnt have basil pesto on it.   I am so over it. I trust my 7 year old brother to do a better job. I almost want to get a job here so I get stuff done correctly.",

I walk in and stand near the cash register to pick up my order. Female employee just stares at me, as if I'm cutting the line ? Not asking what I'm there for until, she finally had to walk over to the register to assist a customer pay. Her aura was salty af, like relax! I'm only here to pick up my order, not rob the place!  After 5-7 minutes of waiting to finally get my pizzas, and the manager (owner?) calls me over. Goes through the motions to show me my pizzas to make sure they are correct. They were correct except for one pizza was a different customers. No big deal, they had the correct pizza done already just need to switch it out.   WRONG! The manager thought it was a big deal! He begins scolding a male employee in front of me. \"You guys suck, like seriously watch these pizzas better!\"   I'm all for coaching your employees, but.... probably should coach the right employee (that employee didn't prep my order!) and two, probably shouldn't be such a jerk? about it.   3 stars for the food 2 for the whack customer service.  Replace your manager or whatever the heck that man was. I'm positive the customer service is lacking, because of his leadership skills.",

They have a lot of ingredients you can pick from, unfortunately since they don't change gloves or use spoons/tongs I couldn't share with my BF and he couldn't eat anything due to his allergy. I liked that they gave a lot but I didn't like the cross contamination. They piled everything in the center and didn't really spread it out evenly on my thing crust pizza, the center was all oil and everything was falling off. The cheese had more flavor than anything else, even though I got about 3 kinds of meat and several veggies. Overall, I'd go back since it's cheap pizza and they seem to have great combo deals.",

Next thing I know Pamela, the cashier, touched the straw that goes inside the bottle with her bare hands without washing her hands or putting on gloves. She changed 3 wine bottles and did exactly the same thing. It was pretty disgusting. I know for sure that I will never order a glass of wine at this place.",

The dough and marinara sauce could be better, but overall they are still delicious. Go on Tuesdays when they have their $6 pizza deal. My favorite pie so far is the sausage and fennel. I add meatballs to it. It gets busy and there isn't too much seating available, especially for large families, so try to go before 6 or after 7:30 to avoid the crowd.  Be creative because their specialty pie menu is limited. If you are looking for more than pizza, this is not your place, but they do have salads.",

    "text": "What a disappointment. We were so excited to come here because we love Blaze but don't have one on this side of town. To begin, the first person to help, Richard (I'm assuming a manager because of the collared shirt) asked me a question and didn't even listen to my answer. He was too busy panicking because the line got a little longer and was trying to keep his employees later. Why this was my problem, I don't know. I had to repeat myself twice because he wasn't paying attention. He pushes my food down to the next person, Kenny (also assumedly a manager, due to the collared shirt) who I had to repeat myself to several times as well because he was focused on the people walking in and talking to the employees around him to pay attention to the customer in front of him. My pizza looks like a mess as he throws the toppings all over the place. After he finishes my pizza, he goes to get a paprt towel to wipe his sweaty face... with his gloves still on! (Later we observe him wiping his nose with the edge of his glove-gross! And then pull up his pants with gloves and goes right back to putting toppings on pizza- that's just disgusting!) He then slides it down to the next person, didn't catch his name, but this one also socializing and ignoring me, I'm waiting for him to ask me what veggies I would like but he's doing everything else but helping me. Again, I'm repeating myself and I get moved along to the cashier who was perfectly fine and polite. We go to sit (at a dirty table, which I cleaned myself) and get called for our pizza shortly after. It's warm-ish. Not hot, yet a little burnt on one edge... ironic. The flavors are good. Love the spicy pepperoni and beef meatball crumble. Everything else is the same as Blaze and Pieology. A floor/bus person, Micah, checks on us, which is nice, but obviously hasn't been trained on how to clean. He wipes a table next to us with a napkin and flicks an olive off the table. All in all, the customer service was ridiculous. I work in the food industry and would never allow my employees to behave this way. If these guys are the managers, they are leading by a terrible example. We may come back in hopes that today was just a bad day, but I am just so disappointed. I would rather make the trip to go to Blaze in Henderson than come to this place down the street. Please tighten up your staff and customer service. Until then, I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "I was so excited for this place to open and was extremely disappointed when we finally visited. The line went to the door but we didn't wait too long to order. The restaurant was very loud and was a little messy. It was difficult to find a clean table. I just figured it was due to how busy it was.  My husband ordered the double crust so I chose the original thin crust pizza. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The ordering process was not very organized to begin with. They took your order and wrote your name on the paper that the pizza crust was placed on. After tells the next person what you wanted on your pizza, it was ready to go in the oven and you proceed to pay. We paid, got our drinks and found a place to sit and wait.  They call out your name when your pizza comes out which adds to the loud atmosphere and on top of it they seem to struggle to read the names they have written down as many of the papers get burned while baking and erases the name. Finally, after my husband and I received both pizzas we tried it. I was so disappointed in the taste of the sauce! It tasted like canned tomato sauce and the crust was extremely thin and looked like it was precooked. My husbands pizza was kept longer because of the double crust and you could see by the burnt paper underneath that it was in the oven a while yet his cheese wasn't even melted! This pizza was NOT good at all! Great concept (although it's not so new anymore) but not good. Save your money and don't try the new place--- go to Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. They are fantastic!",

    "text": "Went in today and line was about 10 people deep but moved relatively quick. Ordered 4 pizzas and an oreo desert pizza. 2 were cheese only, 1 pepperoni, last was pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon, onion, olive, mushroom. I wanted the sweet fennell saisage but the worker was too busy looking at the oven to listen to me. Went to pay and the cashier over charges for the cheese pizzas. They were supposed to be $5.99 each and she charged us $7.99 each. Addressed it with the manager and she gave us the difference in cash. The drinks are free refills with one of the coke machines where you can pick whatever soda that you want. Overall the pizza was good. We also ordered the pizza with double dough which made it a little thicker and, I thought, better. My one suggestion would be to order with extra sauce as the sauce tends to run to the edges and is very minimal in the middle of the pizza. I felt that the pizza was better quality than Pieology.",

    "text": "I don't know what place Mike F went to but that was definitely not my experience and I went there on the same day.  My girlfriend has Celiacs so the entire appeal to PizzaRev was the fact that they offered gluten free.  I thought the price (of the pizza) was great, the idea of a deli style pizza place was novel, and the convenience was amazing.  Now that's about all the good I can say about this place.  The staff was for the most part rude as I heard an employee correct a guest on the guests name.  The gluten free pizza was average to say the least (it's difficult to do gluten free well so I give them a pass as it was edible and not terrible) however the cook burned them.  The staff did a great job with the allergy and I always feel bad as this slows the cooking lines down no matter the restaurant.  But as the line got more and more backed up, the employees seemed frantic and the service went out the window with it.  So alongside the gluten free pizza, I ordered a standard dough pizza for myself.  Mine (which took a fraction of the time) was done first and left in a box on the counter till the other was done (about 20 minutes).  The bottom was burnt pretty bad so I had a burnt, soggy and cold pizza.  The salad price point is ridiculous seeing as how fast food joints give a better salad for less price.  I'm not sure if it was this place or the terrible BWW I had earlier that day, but my stomach did not feel well all night.  The part that really got me though was this was a pickup order too, done before the dinner rush.  We gave the place 45 minutes and it still came 30 minutes late.  There were a few things done well, but for the most part this was a huge mess.  I will give this place another try as the things it did well were awesome (mostly the convenience of their gluten free) but it still has a ways to go to.",

That means I shouldn't see sauce. My pizza last Tuesday basically had no cheese on it. Then when I ask for extra cheese the person look at me like committed a mortal sin. Oh and there must be pepperoni shortage or something because putting only 5 on a pizza is laughable. Can we be a little more loose with the toppings.",

I wish I could give 5 stars however I feel like there is some room for improvement.

I have been in many times and after I choose my sauce they automatically start putting mozzarella cheese. And I have to stop them. It's waste of product and can be avoided by simply asking \"what kind of cheese would you like ? \"  besides that the place is always clean staff is friendly and the pizza always tastes good.",

One pizza is definitely perfect for a single serving, or maybe a little extra. The standard pizza is thin crust but you can ask for double dough for a thicker crust.

    "text": "I'm totally surprised by some of the reviews here - I stopped by with a friend a few days ago and was blown away, I've been looking for an alternative to the expensive, $8 per topping and soggy crust pizza places littered all over LV. I suspect that people who have grown up here don't know good pizza, and as LV locals just like to gripe and bitch about everything anyway......;-)  Having lived in Chicago most recently, I knew I would have to lower my standards where pizza is concerned. A lot. Not surprisingly, I've been mostly disappointed by the pizza I've had, so I've been making my own or buying frozen pizza, which is still better than a lot of the take out pizza here. I used to go to this little hole in the wall make your own pizza joint in Brookfield, WI as I used to travel there a lot. It was amazing. So when I saw PizzaRev I was totally stoked to try it. It was everything I was hoping it would be and more. First of all, Brandon(GM) and Co. were all about the good service and very friendly, explained their za program, etc. While not a wood-fired oven(as I'm a total pizza snob), they did bang out the pizzas cooked perfectly in just a few minutes. I like a very crispy crust and well done crust on the edges, even a little burnt is ok, which it wasn't. And my friend and I both got a really good size za, prob about a small at most pizza joints, covered with toppings and a drink for less than the price of a medium pizza at other places with maybe 2 or 3 toppings on it and with a much shorter wait.  They also have a good rewards app, after 1 visit I was already 20% of the way to a free pizza. And Tuesdays are $6 pizza. There's no downside here for me. I'm done with the crappy, over-priced and under-cooked local pizza places. I'll take the 15 minute drive, it's still quicker than the 25 to 30 minute wait I'll have to suffer through at the corner pizza place anyway. I'm all about the PizzaRev. If you're sick of the same old then this is the the right place to come.",

This has been my second time visiting and it's really great to have a manager be hands on with his crew and have an uplifting spirit. Great pizza and phenomenal service.",

I got my pizza fairly quickly. You can also do half and half toppings. My pizza and Stella (draft) came to around 11 bucks which isn't bad. The place kind of reminds me of Papa Murphy's but the pizza is cooked for you. The flavor was alright but I've had better pizza.",

There was some confusion when I ordered the fennel sausage pizza because I opted for the red sauce instead of just olive oil. They started leaving off the ingredients from the fennel sausage pizza since I changed the sauce. I just wanted red sauce but still wanted everything that comes on the fennel sausage pizza. They even put the wrong cheese (fennel pizza is supposed to have ricotta not mozzarella). I guess I just need to be more clear, but it's my 1st time here.   Dough was thin and crispy, but the ingredients were sparse and not as nicely art directed as a Blaze pizza or Pieology. Those places seem to put more care in the assembly of your custom pizza.   Service was quick and friendly.   Overall feeling - I want to come back and try more but I wasn't wowed by the place.",

I'm just ok with it bc I've been to their competitors and I thought they would be different from pictures on FB which showed a line of draft beers... that was misleading. What kinda got me pissed was that I ordered a house salad and I asked for onions and the dude behind counter said rudely \"no I can't put onions, you want croutons\"  why the F can u not put onions? I asked .... rudely he states \"because I can't\".  Maybe he was having a bad day but no need to be like that. Anyway so service sucks and pizza was decent at best. What I did enjoy was the plethora of hot sauces. I always end my reviews with a saying... this time I'll pass on the saying",

When I go in the guys are always friendly and funny. The food usually comes out the way it's supposed to, well made and hot. I've only had one issue when I ordered five pizzas. I got them remade and it was fine but the service, this particular time was not so great. I sat and waited for the pizzas to be finished with a half assed apology and my time wasted. I value my time and of course I have to wait for the pizzas to be cooked which isn't bad, but they messed up not recompensating me for waiting for the remakes; seeing it was their mess up. Every other time has been good though which is why I give  four stars.",

But the longer you eat here, the more frequent you visit, the mistakes and service is more noticeably annoying and it makes your food taste worse, along with your mood and appetite being ruined.  I came here like 3 or 4 times a week for months.  But here and blaze pizza are just lazy and it's becoming like how chipotles service is.  People working here rotate often cuz it obviously doesnt pay well and it shows in the moods of your employees.  I used to recommend this place to vegans, young and old folk, pizza lovers, foodies, or average people.  But nowadays theres better spots for ya to look.  The spicy red sauce isnt spicy.  The gluten free options cool but some of the vegan options have gluten which is counterintuitive.  The amount of veggies is cool but lately the employees dont lay it on like the used to.  Clientele cant decide what they want",

    "text": "PizzaRev is a solid four stars for me! My family and I always look forward to coming here on Tuesdays for their $6 thin crust pizzas yaaaas!! I like the idea of these kind of restaurants where you can customize your own pizza and put whatever you want on it and however much you want on it! They have LOTS of different options here as far as sauces, toppings, and meat options. They do have vegan cheese, gluten free dough, and vegan sausage.   My go-to pizza was actually recommended to me by the very funny bald man that was working. He said that his favorite sauce is the Alfredo and pesto mixed together, which sounds kinda weird but it is SO good. I prefer double dough over the thin crust because usually the thin crusts always come out with burnt edges. They also have an extensive hot sauce selection - my favorite is he peach vidalia and the chipotle one.   The reason I took a star off was because service here is a hit or miss. Most times when I come in, they have been super friendly and funny. I'll never forget when the guy making my pizza said \"feta make it bettah\" LOL. But sometimes I come in when it's extremely busy and everyone just seems frantic and overwhelmed. I once saw that they lost a guys pizza and had to remake it. But other than that, $6 for a pizza is a steal especially for all the unlimited toppings.",

Pros - Clean atmosphere and friendly staff when we went on a busy Thursday evening. They had quick service and our food didn't take long to get either. Their pizza and salads are inexpensive as well.  Cons - My salad was wilted and not crisp. The lettuce certainly wasn't brown, but it just tasted like it had been at a warm temperature for awhile and limp......     Sorry :( I ended up throwing it out and eating just the pizza. My kids ordered a pepperoni pizza and then we ordered another pizza to take home with various meat and veggies for my husband. Neither pizza was anything to brag about. While the pizza isn't terrible --- it's just not that good either. The crust is thin, and there's not a lot of sauce and cheese. Toppings are sparingly applied to the pizzas too.",

He messily put the toppings on my pizza, leaving little to no cheese. I asked if I could get a bit more cheese, he told me it was $2.00 more....yikes.

Because the pizzas are good, it makes Pizza day amazing! :)  The trick is not to get too many toppings, even though you can get unlimited toppings.  If you get too many toppings, it weighs down the pizza and ends up being soggy.  I would say, don't get more than 3-4 toppings.   Disclaimer, if it's too busy, they might hurry the process and the sauce/cheese/topping ratio gets inconsistent. For example, the cheese may not cover the sauce, the toppings end up in the middle, or the as it's put in the box, the toppings slide more to one side of the pizza.   Maybe I'll see you there on Pizza Tuesday!",

I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted extra cheese and unfortunately I had to keep asking and feeling like an idiot because they kept only sprinkling a few pieces at a time. I did ask for mushrooms and green pepper and I must say they do not cook the pizza very long in the oven probably because they're afraid to burn it but the vegetables on top of the pizza was raw and the cheese was barely even melted in fact it was almost cold. the pizza had no flavor whatsoever! It was not worth the price. The salad was stale and the cookies were very hard and burnt. There is an amazing place like this on Fort Apache called kitchen pizza or something like that and the pizza is so much better and they are not cheap with their toppings and the customer service there is also much better. The owners must keep the employees deadly scared to splurge on anything extra because they were so cheap they barely even gave me a pizza box to wrap up our leftovers definitely not worth your time.

My friend did have a problem where the employ who was making her pizza. He just placed her pizza in the oven without asking if she wanted anymore toppings. As a result, she had to ask him if he could remove her pizza from the oven and add some more toppings. It was minor but it was still an inconvenience. Pizza Rev didn't meet my expectations unfortunately",

The price, is reasonable. The pizza looked good during the line prep. Unfortunately, the pizza was horrible.  The bacon was so hard, I almost broke my teeth!  Staff wasn't as friendly as I would have expected- especially since they just opened. The chicken was also hard.    I won't return here.

    "text": "Went here on a Tuesday night around 7pm because on Tuesdays they have unlimited topping any kinda of pizza for 6$ (regularly $7.99). Was super busy and the restaurant was packed.  Kinda dirty and it seems like they were working on a couple kinks due to just opening because all the employees were wondering where the other employees were because they seemed short staffed. While we were paying for our pizza, I found it super unprofessional as the cashier was screaming across the line to the other employee about wanting to get a \"smoke break\" and they he was dying for a \"smoke break\".  :/ Details of the menu:  A) 3 types of dough: regular- thin crust, double dough (recommended)- their regular crust is super thin, and their vegan dough ( isn't dough already vegan??!?!?!: flour, water, yeast and salt)- must ask them what makes it Vegas because that worries me what's in their regular one unless they are putting butter into the dough which is unusual for pizza dough B) Sauces: Organic red sauce, white sauce/alfredo and some kinda green sauce- didnt ask whats in it C- Choose your cheese: Regular (buffallo and mozerella), blue cheese, ricotta, feta and I believe goat cheese and vegan cheese D) toppings: tons of meat options- 3 different kinds of pepperoni (regular-pro, spicy, and all beef), italian sausage, fennel sausage, meatballs, anchovies, ham, etc E) veggies- all sorts with sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, spinach, roasted and minced garlic, onions-white and red, artichoke hearts and many more  ***COOK time in oven is somewhere from 5-10min. NGL the pizza on the bottom and edges were burnt and it was really weird because I was watching the guy take the pizzas out and the spatula he was using (metal) was all crusted off at the end and already deteriorating- even he was weirded out by it because he spent a good 30 seconds just staring it.   The reason for the 3 star rating is because I am comparing this to BLAZE PIZZA. Idk if I was just underwhelmed by the whole concept because i had seen it before (subway or chipotle style line-make your own custom style). As i bit into my custom made for me pizza I just didnt get the same satisfaction as when I did with Blaze. Maybe because the dough wasnt as tasty and neither was their sauce. I hate to say but i prefer BLAZE PIZZA.  As for other specials they had it was great. They have a full service bar with wine and beer (dont believe they have liquor). I saw they had a special for 4 pizzas and 4 beers for 40$.   I believe we will be back because it it a couple blocks from my house. Have to give it another try when they get their service a little more in order.",

    "text": "Talk about the create your own pie market. Not that am complaining because competition is always good thing in the restaurant business. Once I saw they were building PizzaRev down the road from my house. I was excited too see where PizzaRev would stack up with Pieology, The Pizza Kitchen, and Blaze (honest that one have not tried yet). The concept is really nothing different in all of them. It all in the details that separates each one. PizzaRev somethings that prefer over the rest but if talking about the food just ok. The positive thing is they serve BEER. Who not a fan of beer and pizza??They even serve draft beer!!! Not huge selection on tap but they also have different bottle beers. Pieology not sure if they serve beer I know draft no way and The Pizza Kitchen that negative. The interior has more of adult vibe if there such thing maybe because serve alcohol. Or the fact seems louder then the rest. The fountain machine is way cool one of those multi drinks ones that push button. The service I found was excellent. It was busy went right at peak lunch time so had a wait. Nothing too long of wait for line that nearly went out the front door. They also sell cookies by the cashier when you pay. Wish had room for because some of them looked tasty.   The food I had regular dough (they do offer gluten free and double dough something they call it), tomato sauce, spicy pepperoni, sweet fennel sausage, jalapeno, and basil. The tomato sauce thought was pretty plain nothing stood out about it. The sweet fennel sausage that was winnah for sure!!! The toppings feel like the other places offer more of a selection choose from and when looking at the options not that look fresh fresh. The double double dough might be better then the regular. Try that theory out next visit.  Overall think PizzaRev is another great addition or option comes too create your own pie. Just if had choice would go to the other ones. If am in the area would stop by in minute get pizza fix in.",

You have the option to choose thin, thick or gluten free crust. I ordered the thin crust but next time I would absolutely get the think crust which my husband ordered. I went a little out of my normal pizza toppings because I was so overwhelmed by choice.   The pizza I made was screaming for salt. Their red sauce is okay. Next time I would ask for light sauce and add bacon or feta for a little extra salt kick.   For the price and the location I am sure we will be back and I will give another sauce a try to see if it helps make a difference with the amount of salt the pizza needed.",

    "text": "So i think they were taking the lead from Pieology but they dont compare. First off they put very very little toppings on it and when you ask for a bit more they literally put on two more pieces of pepperoni and acted like it was a big deal.  The pizza itself was not as good tasting as well Too bad we had high hopes for it and its much closer than Summerlin but my bill was 19.96 for two smaller pizzas and one soda.  My heart belongs to Pieology  Heres an add on to yesterdays post a copy of my bill when i checked out and a copy of what they charged my card Now you can decide if you want to do business with them",

If you really like your pizzas to have a lot of toppings, go for the craft your own!  Craft your own pizza: Red Sauce, extra cheese, italian sausage, chicken, pepperonis, onions, mushrooms, jalapenos, garlic, and spinach! Way too good, I like my pizza like this!   Everything is pretty good in here, workers were pretty nice! And yes, I'll be back again!",

Thought it was a good deal so I went for it. The young kid (presumably new) asked what i wanted on my salad so I proceeded to tell him. The guy next to him never said anything until it was done, then says \"oh that's a create your own, not part of the H&H\". So I ask what is and I'm told \"House or Cesar\". Cesar is out of the question and Their house salad only has carrots and tomatoes. Had i known that was my option, i would have just did the full pizza.   While standing at the register, the lady ringing us up asked what we had and I explained, then told her    that I want to make sure they are only charging me for half of a pizza since I'm paying for a full salad. She told me she couldn't do that so of course I was  even more irritated because this was no fault of my own and I didn't want a house salad! I had to just walk away, had i known, i would have just did the full pizza!!  The situation should have been handled differently. Umm, charge me for the H&H and give me my little salad I originally ordered!. NOPE, instead I'm asked if I want the Cesar or House smh.   Too boot, the vegan sausage was very rubber-ish, with no flavor, not like the past when I've dined here.   Oh well,  THANK YOU, NEXT!!",

They said that they would make me a replacement one and that it would take 5 minutes to cook. Well about 12:27 rolled around and I received my pizza.  Only half of the original toppings had been put on my new pizza. Not having the time for a third try, I took the new sloppy pizza. The employee told me to have a nice day!

So I was excited to get my carb-load on!  On this trip, I noticed that they had a cauliflower crust so I decided to try it. Boy was I disappointed. The brought out the crust completely frozen, and just started putting my desired toppings on and threw it into the oven.  When I started eating it, it was definitely under cooked and cold on the inside. We were in a bit of a hurry, so I didn't want to wait for another one to be made. So I shared with my brother. His was really good. So I recommend staying away from the cauliflower crust pizza at this place. Lesson learned!  Customer service was good. everyone was friendly and they add a good amount of toppings. This place is a little off strip though, so it's mainly a locals joint. I look forward to my next visit, with regular crust this time!",

Walking in, I could see where the line was supposed to form and where you start making your pizza, but the menus were at the end near the register making it confusing to me at first. I feel like the menus should have been at the beginning of the line so you could see all the options rather than relying on the person making the pizza to tell you all the toppings available.   The young lady making our pizzas was nice and helpful while we decided the toppings. After we were done I walked up to the register where I felt as if I was interrupting a conversation. There were a handful of employees I assume off the clock hanging out at the bar talking with the employees on the clock. I really felt as if I was bothering them. They were all laughing and talking, very unprofessional. If I hadn't already ordered, I would have just left. It was a very uncomfortable environment. I will probably never eat at Pizza Rev again due to this. There are plenty of \"build your own\" places in town to eat at without feeling so uncomfortable.",

My pizza was so delicious that I was craving it for the next two days.  They offer 3 different crust options thin crust, regular crust and double crust. I ordered double crust with a green and white sauce and it was the best pizza ever.   They also offer beer and wine. Yum! A customized pizza with unlimited toppings and yummy desserts. Win!   I love their chocolate chip cookies. The two times I've visited they were just coming out of the oven.",

She never once smiled and acted very angry. Seemed like shes not happy to be working. She was stone faced with every customer. The coca cola machine was out of most every flavored drink. The floors were filthy. Soda spills covering the soda machine and also on the floor by the soda machine that looked very old. Dropped my napkin on the floor and saw crumbs that looked to have been building up on the floor for over a year.  We had a coupon so we can't complain too much but if we would have came without a coupon, I would be very disappointed.  Pizza was just ok. Not much flavor. This place needs to kick out the blond lady at the cash register who hates being here, shop vac and scrub the floors and then they will be able to compete with Blaze.",

Rainbow location several times and always on Tuesdays where you get pizza with all the toppings of your choice for 6.99. The pizza is always delicious and crispy, even if you order the double dough. The toppings are fresh and they have a wide variety which even includes capers. The line is usually long but moves fast. It is kind of like cafe rio or subway where you go down the line adding the items of your choice. The staff is always friendly and courteous. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because on two occasions they mixed up my pizza and gave it to someone else. They did go out of their way to make it right both times. Also the parking lot gets packed so I would suggest to come early or after 1 to beat the lunch rush. If you are looking for a fast and yummy lunch on a budget check it out.",

The cleanliness of this place is disgusting and I knew I should've just walked out. It wanted to try it though. They don't change gloves in between making different pizzas. I don't eat pork and watched them touch all the pepperoni pizzas ahead of mine and then make my chicken pizza. I let it slide. The guy at the beginning of the line asked me what kind of sauce I wanted as he knocked over a can into the red sauce. Threw the can away but didn't change the sauce! The health department needs to be called on this place! I got the BBQ chicken pizza with thin crust. It is so bland and tasteless. The BBQ sauce on the pizza was the best part. It's super thin crust and still wasn't cut in even sizes. I had 4 smaller uneven slices and then two large slices. The side Caesar salad is over priced for it to be so small. The lettuce leaves were wilted and the dressing is not tasty. I ordered my food to-go and the guy who called my name out gave me my pizza. My salad was on the counter and I said this is mine too. He asked me if I was sure as if I was actually trying to take an unpaid for salad. I said yes do you need to see my receipt? He said yes and proceeded to hold up my receipt in the light like he was trying to check to see if a $100 bill is authentic or not. I have never been so embarrassed especially when I know I paid for all of my items!!!! I will never spend another dollar in that establishment as long as they're offering that kind of customer service!",

How in the world was there no bacon??  They told me their truck was late and they were not sure when they would have more. I now this may seem insignificant to some, but this is a little indulgence that I enjoy on my pizza EVERY-TIME I go to Pizza Rev.  So I reluctantly had my pizza built without bacon :( After a few minutes, I heard my name called, I jumped up to get my pizza, only it wasn't my pizza!  My pizza was not in the oven nor on the line or in the box they tried to hand me.  They gave MY handcrafted (no bacon) pizza to someone in front of me.  Since my lunch break was nearly over, I just asked for a refund.  The cashier first asked for my credit card to apply the refund to, then he called someone else over, because he didn't know how to give a refund.  The second person, also did not know how to issue a refund and just reprinted my original receipt.  They eventually, ended up just giving me cash back.  Never did anyone apologize for giving my food away, never did anyone seems even a little remorseful, just $8.64 in hand and that's it. No lunch.  No bacon.  No good.  Disappointed.",

I had a jar of Ragu at home and could not taste any difference. I don't know why they call it double dough it is still pretty thin and its not fresh its frozen, the cheese is pretty good but when they didn't give me very much cheese I asked for more all they put on was a tiny bit more. I had to say \"I like LOTS AND LOTS OF CHEESE\" and they looked at me like I was expecting too much. they're kinda chinsey on the cheese. I know cheese isn't exactly cheap but why advertise I can have as many I want then bitch when I want more than you thought? I tried it 2 times but I don't think ill go back again. I think I will go next door to Albertsons, grab a boboli crust, some tomatoes and cheese and make my own pizza way better....",

We especially loved Brandon's lively, charismatic and helpful personality. I would come to Pizza Rev for the pizza, but we would definitely come to this location for the outstanding service as well. Not to mention the prices here are so reasonable for the quality ingredients they use. AND...They even have a Vegan option!! 5 stars to me!!",

I asked how it all works, since we'd never been here before, and wasn't given any explanation. Still just stared at. Then my name was called 3 times to pick up our order, which still wasn't complete. The hostess did bring the final items over so I didn't have to get up a fourth time. The pizza was OK, prices are average, place looks nice, but I didn't see anyone the entire time come clean tables as people left. We were only third set of customers here at the time, so it wasn't even busy yet. Experience wasn't horrible, but nothing great.",

I'm allergic to soy and I am vegan, I stopped in here to ask if they used soy in their vegan pizzas, the girl I spoke with just didn't know what their ingredients where so I asked her if she could ask someone who was more knowledgeable about their ingredients and she left and came back and told me \" they don't tell them that stuff \" what ? Seemed like a really cool place, but giving one star for \" young bad customer service \" & lack of knowledge of menu ingredients",

About throws me off my appetite,  but I'm craving pizza and the price, so even a child projectile vomiting won't get into my way.  I pay ahead becuase I'm in a hurry and pay  at the register. While waiting they finally called my name and it was the wrong pizza. I should have said yes and taken it since I was hungry and in a hurry. But I said no and still waited for my pizza. 10 minutes later they proceed to tell me that they \"f*cked up on my pizza\" and were making me a new one. IM ABOUT TO BE LATE FOR WORK. They said they were sorry and i immediately asked for my money back. Thank you for the heads up way later then expected. when I was in a hurry! It was greatly appreciated!!!! Great pizza spot!

They remade the pizza by memory instead of asking me what was on it and it ended up having 3 missing toppings. At this point they said sorry and offered me a buy 1 get 1 coupon for next visit.

It is only $7.99 to create your own pizza and you can pile on any or all the toppings for no extra charge! They have a lot of toppings to choose from. Different cheeses ranging from Italian blend to blue cheese or feta, different sauces like organic red sauce or white, different meats from your basic pepperoni to grilled chicken and of course lots of vegetables! It good quality pizza cooked in a pizza oven and made hot and fresh when ordered. They defiantly hook you up on sauce it was a little too saucy for me but if you love extra sauce in your pizza then it would be perfect! Next time I'll just order light sauce.",

The employees are friendly, but they seemed a little scattered when it comes to organization. It's cohesion that is key and when I walked in with my family it was a little after 2pm still pretty busy but the wait to get a pizza made took 10-15 then another 10-15 to get your pizza. The dough was decent, I wish they cooked it a little longer to fully get the dough cooked. It was a little flimsy closer toward the middle. My biggest complaint for this is my sister had placed an online to go order as we sat down and it took about 25 mins to get the order when they weren't busy any longer. When my sister approached the register to ask about her to go order the employee walked away and about 5 mins later she noticed they hadn't made the pizza though the app said it was boxed and ready! I found it terrible service that they didn't have a response as to why the pizza wasn't ready yet! Bad customer service and to have wasted 25 mins after eating our meal to wait for an online order we had placed at that time 35 mins before was terrible! What's the point of an app with a progress tracker if it's totally inaccurate!",

You can get anything on your pizza for one price, (which by the way is not clear on the paper menu or the menu board) but don't expect it to be a lot of any of it,   Ordered a thin pizza and it had the fennel sausage and a few other things on it.  Fennel sausage as in 5 pieces of fennel sausage.  The pizza was out before I even got my soda filled up.  I thought, \"wow, that was fast.  Pretty cool!  That oven must be hot as hell.\"  I'm excited because I am thinking that crust was going to be crispy, just like I like it.  Nope.  It was a tiny bit crispy on the very edge, but the rest was like warm dough. This pizza reminded me of a microwave pizza.  One bite and everything fell off because there was way too much sauce.    I would have been happier with a $1 Totino's pizza from the frozen section at the grocery store. On a side note:  I am not a wine drinker, but if I were, I would be totally turned off by the wine glasses that were hanging above the beer taps.  They were very cloudy and unclean looking.  Like another reviewer stated:  Nothing really came together for me.  I am not sure I am willing to go a second round.",

Richie checked on guests and made it his goal to build everyone in this building up. So until things change, it seems it'll still be an unpleasant visit.",

I said I've to keep asking because you gave me two pieces each time, just put it in oven (after I got fed up from a long day of working with no time to get food, am from out of town and going hypoglycemic).

    "text": "So this place has probably the best Crust out of these types of fast service pizza places for sure. Double Dough is the way to go. I only recommend the thin crust if your not loading too many heavy toppings on your pizza.  The service here was great, thought the line process in this store seems to have some sort of hiccups. Can place my finger on it.  The amazing selection of hot sauces, is also what makes this my go to spot. Great deals with 1.00 pizza's on Tuesdays, and 9.99 pizza and beer all day every day! Recommend downloading the app and getting a free pizza! It takes 12 or so hours for the coupon to go through, but hey you earn points for more free pizza! Can't beat that!  I would recommend coming in here during it's slower times. After rush lunch or right before dinner. Also open late so good go to!",

While we were in the middle of ordering the worker stopped us so he could put in a fellow workers order in front of ours (the fellow worker looked to have just finished their shift). That was annoying but we decided to just let it go and wait till he was done to then finish our order. When my husband got to the table with our three pizzas I looked at the receipt and noticed we were way over charged for our order. We ordered a pizza with just sauce and no cheese or toppings (due to our child's allergies) and they charged us double for that pizza than the normal price of just a cheese pizza. We were also charged for extra toppings on my pizza that were not ordered. If that all wasn't to make us never want to come back to taste and quality of the pizza was worst than frozen pizza. Save yourself money and frustration and don't go here.",

I can finish the thin crust myself, but the double dough is really filling and I only finish about half. The best part are their hot sauces. My favorite is the mango Bonney.  Anyways staff was friendly, pizza cooked perfectly, nice atmosphere.  Tip: try the Oreo pizza and cookies. So good!",

They showed in no way they wanted their jobs. They threw the toppings, so the majority of my toppings were placed on one side. The were rude at the cashier.  When we did get our pizzas the lady just tossed our pizzas on the counter. When I asked for the ranch the cashier huffed at me like I was the biggest inconvenience ever. And after my daughter ate her sideways pizza, she went to the counter for a box and was ignored by 4 different staff members before they so rudely asked her what did she want. The pizza was still edible. I was just completely astonished by this staff. But maybe they were just having a bad day. I wont come to this one again, they put me in a mood I don't like, and I feel so much better being out of there.  Pizza was good tho.",

I went today since I'm 37 weeks pregnant and was craving it so badly, just to have to leave and drive to the rancho and Sahara location. Next time it would be extremely helpful if you let customers know as soon as they walk in or with some sort of signage at the door that you are out of chicken sausage spinach and ect and have no to go pizza boxes! They said that after a few minutes cool about the ingredients, but after waiting much longer, I'm told theirs no to go boxes and if I want a plate. How can I drive like that with a hot pizza? I was ordering food for myself and four other people. They were out of everything. I drove Super far after wasting my time there. Thanks! I hope this isn't something that happens often at lunch time!

The idea of $7.99 for an unlimited topping pizza is amazing.   I always get the double dough, and almost everyone I know that's gone at least once will agree that their thin crust is just too cracker-like.   While I love to load my pizza up, my only warning is this, the more toppings you add, the less hot the entire topping base will be. Adding like 6+ toppings causes some of the toppings not to get as hot as the pizza. Just a little tip for those who go crazy their first time.   Also! They have a nice beer + pizza special for under $10 for those who want to wash it down with a cold one. Skip the soda, because they use that stupid new Coke machine that takes forever",

The crust was PAPER THIN. They were out of mushrooms. The taste was that of I'd rather eat the box feeling. The staff was should I say........ lacking. Very slow, I felt as if I was getting my oil changed not ordering a pizza. The tables were dirty and the place was empty. SO much wrong I don't know what else to say. Yes I do, NEVER AGAIN. Blaze is SO MUCH better.",

The server was full of energy and they keep a good sense of humor. You can order salad as well if you are not in the mood for pizza. I built my own pizza using their thin crust, red sauce, cheddar cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onion, bell peppers, jalapenos, and olives. The quality was really good and I loved how the thin crust didn't leave me super full. If you're a big eater you can finish one order to yourself. It was pretty cheap as I didn't pay anything over $10 for one. They also have different sauces you can put on your pizza. I wasn't too big on extra sauce. I feel like a lot of these build your own pizza places are popping up and if you're in the area give this place a try!",

Nothing exciting. They don't bring the pizza out to you. Again just average.  As for the pizza, average. It is not very good. The dough tastes like frozen pizza dough. The sauce tastes canned and the cheese tastes processed. I think Pieology is better and The Pizza Kitchen is even better. The ingredients at those two places are fresher and the dough and sauce taste homemade.   I really had high hopes for Pizza Rev opening in the area but the whole fire baked flavor just isn't' there. The pizza got cold very fast and could use an extra 20 sec.   I think the management needs to work on the staff and their knowledge of the product and customer service skills.  I think they also need to figure out how to make fresh dough and sauce. There is a lot of competition in this market and they will sink quickly.   I wasn't surprised to only see 3.5 stars after opening.",

Simple menu, one size pizza about 10 inches, you can make your own or choice from some established combos. It is an assembly line process similar to ...Chipotle. After you walk down the line and get all the toppings that you want, it goes into the fired oven. takes about 5 mins, very fast. Cost $8 per pizza. About the same as a custom burrito at ....Chipotle.  The pizza was good...not great. Probably a good place for lunch when a small pizza served fast will do. I ordered two pizzas to go, and they got a little confused at the line,  and later at the register because they came out at different times. But staff was very friendly.  Not the place to go with a group wanting to eat, drink beer and watch a game. Great place to take kids and let them make their own mini pizzas...just like Chipotle.",

I had a question about the salad sizes or if there was multiple sizes and the older red head woman was very snotty regarding my question and let me know there is only one size.    The next employee I had a problem with was the very very tall gentleman with long dark hair. He was working to the right of the woman taking the orders. He asked me if I wanted any Parmesan cheese on my salad and I asked for a little bit. He was also very snotty and picked up the tiniest pinch of cheese and just threw it on my salad. Not amused kid.  Everyone else in the line was just screaming and making annoying whale-moaning sounds every time someone would walk in. A simple welcome in or welcome to pizza rev would have sufficed.  There is a tiny bar section where employees eat pizza on their breaks I assume. But they continue to yell out order names while they eat their pizzas. Just let them take their break!!  The ONLY saving grace this shop has is an employee named Micah. Very sweet guy working the dining area offered to get us boxes and tidy up our table. A+ customer service from him!  Pizza was meh at best and atmosphere is like recess in a middle school. Drive the extra 15 minutes to Pieology in Downtown Summerlin. I'm never disappointed there.",

But she wasn't gone more than 20 minutes and when the food got back to work, it was still piping hot.  The pizza is just how I like it.  It has a thin, crispy crust.  The sauce was the perfect amount and flavourful.   It had plenty of cheese on it as well.  Now, the only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five, is because there were only 8 slices of pepperoni on the entire pizza.  The pizza toppings are all one price and unlimited, which is nice, but I guess you have to tell them, if you want a lot on it.  Next time I will have to go in and see them make it, so I can request more pepperoni.  That is my only complaint though, because it tasted really good.",

I chose half a margarita & the other half BBQ chicken. Wanted to add ricotta to the margarita side but they were out. Ricotta is sold & available everywhere... The tomatoes were diced finely and it looked like my pizza had salsa on it. This also made my pizza wet and I HATE wet pizza. Why can't they simply cut a baby tomato in half & call it a day? On to the BBQ chicken pizza, the chicken didn't taste like anything, completely bland with zero seasoning. They forgot to add red onions to it as well which I should have caught as they were making it but it was an item that was supposed to come on that particular pizza.   The pizzas are super thin which I love but mine was unfortunately soggy from the diced tomatoes. I also like that they cook in about 3-4 minutes. I may give it one more shot and try something else but first impressions are a big deal to me and this one wasn't a good one.",

    "text": "Honestly, I don't get the 3.5 star rating on this place. This place is literally right up the street from where I live and I've been meaning to try this place forever!  In fact, I've only tried these type of pizza places twice before and been wildly unimpressed both times. We tried Novicento on Eastern years back (it has since closed) and 800 Degrees in the SLS Casino. Meh on both.  This place is different though. At PizzaRev..  a) they were friendly b) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings c) they had one of those awesome Coke machines with all the flavors (I fucking love those things!) d) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings  Did I mention that they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings?? This was awesome and the result was a filling, tasty, and satisfying pie!   I simply added pineapple and grilled chicken to my pie while my friend added sausage, ham, pepperoni, and feta cheese to his. We were both impressed with both the fresh flavor of the toppings in addition to the generous amounts added.   Not only that, but unlimited toppings is just $7.99 a pie! Sweet! I can go for that!  I really like this place and I will DEFINITELY be back for more!  5 stars.  Fuck yea!",

The line wasn't super long by any means and they had quite a few people working, however, the person manning the register was also in charge of cooking the pizzas and he was running back and forth.  Needless to say, my pizza was burnt around the edges and way too soft in the center.   I also asked for only half my pizza to have spinach and artichokes but the guy put it on the entire pizza and realized only after the fact.  I really didn't want to wait for another pizza to be made after each mistake so took it as it was and continued to be disappointed, not that they offered to remake it anyhow.    This was my second time here and both times I have been disappointed so I will definitely not be returning, nor can I imagine myself recommending this place to anyone in the future.",

We approached the front and the guy shares, \"we are out of boxes so you cannot order take out.\" No hello, no greeting, my first experience starts with an abrupt sharing of what I cannot be provided.    While in line the server had an attitude. Midway through our sauce order he proclaims, \"I have to greet other people for food and walks away.\" We stand there a little bewildered and embarrassed. Another guy comes after 2 minutes. I asked for extra pep, he put on a few slices, and was annoyed when I asked for more. I asked for spicy pep, he did not add any, then asks, \"you all done?\"   In addition to being out of boxes and out positive customer service, they were out of Parmesan cheese and romaine lettuce for the Caesar. Food was decent. The experience leading up to it was visceral. If you want McDonald's quality customer service, this place is for you!",

I asked to have a salad and was told rudely that they don't have salad no one has salads because of the romaine E. coli breakout. At that point I was sketchy based on the lack of customer service and the change in staff that my pizza wasn't going to be as good as it used to be and sure enough I was right. Edges were burnt, I had way too much sauce on the pizza that I had to scrape some of it off. I won't be going back here for a while hopefully they change their staff or management or whatever it is That's causing the only thing they serve to be horrible.",

Well the family and I decided to pay Pizza Rev a visit and to my surprise the Pizza turned to be better than what I expected.  I like the fact that you are able to build your own pizza, and choose every single ingredient even down to the crust. At first I thought that the pizza looked a bit small to fill an adult but after all the toppings were put on and the pizza baked, it actually turned out to be very filling. I ordered the classic pizza and added olives and mushrooms, the taste was really fresh and the pizza overall had really good flavor.   I was making plans to maybe order another pizza since I thought it wasn't going to fill me up but I have to say that I was really surprised, not only did it fill me up but I was rather full for a while since it was really filling. Over all I have to give this place a 4 star rating, and most likely will be back in the future.",

Once you choose your toppings the pizza goes in the oven and a few minutes later a server calls you to the counter to retrieve your pizza. I was there during the lunch rush and the staff seemed to be very efficient. The one thing that sets this place apart from Blaze is the sauce. The organic red sauce is outstanding!!

    "text": "Hit the spot. Had been craving pizza all week and did not feel like purchasing all the fixings I wanted to make my own. This place was pretty good. Thought I was at chipotle a little bit with the conveyor belt process of a build your own. But it was ok... you gotta watch the person making your pizza... I ended up with double spinach cause dude lost track of what pizza he was working on. Not complaining cause I love the green. Just saying. I was paying for the group and two people in our group were already at the register and the employee kinda rushed the process and one drink got ordered for the table. Very distracting trying to build my pizza 10ft away and try to pay the bill at the same time. After you create your own the pie gets tossed in the oven and stood there waiting for several minutes. Realizing we didn't have a beverage I decided I wanted a beer. Oh yeah they have beer. On tap and in bottles. Now hold it.. as We are standing at the register now.. going on like 10m. No one has been at the register. The line has piled up.. our pizza is cooling off and we're getting hangry. I notice in this time that you can get ANY PIZZA and a BEER for 9.95. This combo is confusing to me as the pizza I ordered was that alone because the \"thick\"crust option is a high price. So hint... get the original thin crust. So finally some girl comes from the back and says because we already paid for the food (remember when we were rushed through) we had to pay again for the beer. Even though based on their advertising.... I should have a BEER in my hand. We paid extra for the beer because well.. pizza and beer. So all in all the key is original crust and get your beer at the register. Also.. just like most places being vegan or offering vegan options, your are paying a premium (extortion) for this.. like 1$ charge for vegan cheese (daiya) and then receiving a fraction of the amount of cheese as to be compared to a dairy pizza. I would be back for the convenience of it. But would not at all make it a habit as it's not that special.",

I honestly couldn't believe they handed it to me looking like that, with literally half the pizza missing. So they made me a new one at my request.

    "text": "Their concept is pretty cool... You get to create your own pizza for $7.99 w/ unlimited toppings (they have pre-created ones as well). They gave out cards for free pizza during their grand opening, so of course I had to try it.  I got the craft your own pizza & chose: Double Dough, BBQ Sauce, Italian Cheese, Ricotta Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crispy Bacon, Mushroom, & added Fresh Spinach after it was baked.  Although their pizza was good, I honestly wish I enjoyed it more.  I can't pin point what was wrong with it. The dough was soft, meats were good, they gave ample amount of each topping, and 1 pizza could definitely be shared between 2 people. But, there was something still missing... Like as if everything was a little bland for my taste buds. Nonetheless, it was good & I'm glad I got to try it.  The atmosphere is very chill & casual, and the employees were super nice & friendly. Like all new things, opening day can be a little rough. But despite the cons above, I'd still give them another chance & hopefully my pizza will have more flavor next time.  I initially wanted to give it 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars for satisfying my hunger, and for its potential.",

I've seen a them in action with the manager or owner here, it's worse of an experience! He yells and calls them names in front of customers instead of training them and showing them what to do.

They used to let us customize our salads, after all we are paying for them! Rather sharply I was told I can't do that. I have to take it as it comes. On top of that my sons pizza was burnt and 3 other of our gluten free pizzas were soggy. They used to have the best gluten free pizzas. I will not be returning and I will have to find a new pizza place. Very disappointed!!!",

And also olive oil.  They have around 30 toppings to choose from.  I think their dough is plain, and they should probably add something like garlic salt and/or more butter to their dough.  SERVICE:  3/5. -They skimp on pretty much every topping you ask for.  Even if you ask for double, it usually isn't as much as you want. -They're actually pretty fast, even during the lunch rush.

    "text": "Note the 1 star lest of 5 stars again is due to hubby' s veggie and meat pizza flaw: the chicken was cold.  I came to love Pizza Rev since my first time a year ago. This location is a hit or miss though. Usually we get stingy pizza makers. I often want to revise my review for a 2 stars for that. But the last trip I have to give them cuddos because I'm pregnant and really NEEDED my Pizza Rev lol! I live west pass Blaze Pizza on W. Sahara and Hualapai but would drive down to PR on Rancho or Rainbow because I love PR and don't really like BP (due to lacking yummy hot sauces like PR, vegan cheese, vegan sausages and sun dried tomatoes) unless my husband is too lazy to drive. The Rainbow location is an easier drive compare to the one on Rancho. But due to the Rainbow location's inconsistency, we frequent the Rancho location instead. The last trip to the Rancho location this past weekend 04/14or15(?), we got there at 9pm and it was closed when sign and website said they're open until 11pm. Like said Im pregnant and really NEEDED PR at that time lol! I almost lost my mind thinking I wont get it and we skipped BP by us for it lol. Anyway my husband was sweet enough to drive me all the way to the Rainbow location. I was hoping to God I get a good pizza maker to load me up some extra pineapples and extra vegan sausages on top of my vegetarian pizza, or else I wouldn't mind buying 2 pizzas since we already went around the world for it. The little Asian girl was awwwesome! Made my pizza just perfect! In fact, I want to go back again like right NOW...I think I actually will lol. Thanks little lady!",

It might be the worst pizza I've ever had, or at least Top 3. And I guess, one star tossed in for charity, because they offer vegan cheese.  Other than that, I do not ever wish to eat the pizza here. The crust is like a crappy pita that's been in a toaster oven too long. I've had better crackers. It makes a frozen pizza look gourmet. And WTF @ the size. It was barely a snack. The olives did not taste slightly fresh. The vegan sausage was flavorless. The sauce wasn't that great.  We left & had to go get food.  And these guys offer beer, but what they really mean is a selection worse than a college bar, or even Dottie's. It was like, Coors, Stella, a bottle of Dos Equis, and a few wine bottles with dust on them. Ya'all paid for a liquor license for THAT? I just don't get it...",

Upon walking in, you're greeted by friendly staff and a large menu on the side of the wall.  There's 2 types of crust to pick from: thin and regular and then you can go crazy with your toppings like I did, or pick from the suggestion menus that they have! Regardless of how much topping you put on, it's the same price (that's why I went crazy!)   The crust was nice and crunchy and the pizza was cooked to perfection! I concluded that if I was eating by myself and wanted to create a speciality pizza, this would be a great place but if I was craving a simple pepperoni pizza, i could get it elsewhere. There were 6 slices to my pizza and I think because of the massive amount of toppings I put on it, I was only able to finish 2 and take the rest home.  All in all, I am coming back for more!!",

Just uttered something about traditional crust and barely looked in our general direction.  (See service) 2. Thinner crust, chewy, selections of toppings, similar to a lot of other \"pizza craft\" restaurants  Ambiance 1. Spacious, good amount of seating.  2. I like that this one (possibly others) has a Coca-Cola Freestyle to make various flavored drinks  Service 1. This is where the 2/5 stars comes in 2. From the initial greeting with the \"something -something\" crust offering to the end it was not great.  I had to ask twice/thrice since the person choosing the crust to get things started had a poor attitude.  Practically snipped words I could barely make out and looked annoyed when I wasn't able to catch the words to make sense of what she is saying.  No guidance on how to pick toppings.   3. At the cashier, I had to wait for a very long time as some guy never greeted me but passed by a multitude of times and never looked my way even though I was holding a credit card and clearly needed to pay.  Thought crossed my mind that perhaps this business prefers to just GIVE pizzas away. 4. There was a snafoo with an \"unidentified pizza\" floating around which involved almost all the staff and manager to figure out why one customer got the wrong pizza and one unclaimed pizza.  I have to reiterate it all starts with the initial encounter where a friendly employee NEEDS to politely ask for names and properly write it on the paper like they do at Blaze or Pieology.  And yet the entire business had to come to practically a halt due to the pizza mixup. 5. manager presented \"my\" pizza to me but questioned me along the lines of \"Isn't this your pizza\".  I am not sure why it so difficult to identify the pizzas here.  On top of that, he was not friendly, did not smile and treated me as if he was annoyed with me rather than concerned about customer service and experience. 6. One young female employee (did not catch name) came around and checked on us.  If it wasn't for her, I would say the service is terrible.    MoJo/JuJu 1. I am not sure I will go back here unless necessary.  Maybe it was a bad day or bad time.  I was always told poor management leads to poor staff.  Find another \"BYO-build your own pizza\" joint if you can there ARE others.  (been here twice btw and both times so-so)",

    "text": "What a difference a year makes. Great experiences a year ago but haven't had the opportunity to return - until tonight. Not busy at all (its a Wednesday evening). My wife, my daughter and myself show up. Daughter orders pizza w/o cheese or meat. Wife and I get our pizzas with meats and cheeses. I find that the parmesan cheese shaker is empty. As I take it up to the counter for a replacement I notice how filthy it is. Not unusual as folks are using their pizza sauce covered hands to shake it out. But I put it in front of the employee and leave it thinking he'd switch out.  I fill my drink cup and go back to the counter to pick up what I'm assuming will be a fresh shaker (clean and full of cheese) The one I laid in front of the employee is still there as I left it (see photo). The worker isn't really busy working -- as it's not that busy. Thinking he may have been distracted I pick it up and wait to get his attention. He sees me and the shaker and says \"Oh, yea...that. Can't you just use the packs of cheese over there?\" If I wanted to use the packs I would have taken some packs. I replied \"are you all not providing any more shakers tonight?\" He mumbles something which I think was about being \"too busy\". It wasn't busy. At all.  Then my wife's and my pizza ready. Seemed to be a bit too quick. As we bite into them we realize they are not as hot as they should be. But I'm a bit irritated about the trivial cheese thing and I don't think I want to talk to the employee again so I eat what I have. (I should have said something...my bad). We are halfway finished with our pizzas and my daughter's still hasn't been served. Again...establishment not busy at all.  In the scheme of things this is all very trivial. But not while you are experiencing it. Very frustrating. Completely different vibe from just a year ago. Very disappointing. Far too many choices in that part of town. I'll give those a try next time.",

    "text": "I frequently go to PizzaRev, especially on Tuesdays when pizzas are discounted!  For those who haven't eaten here before, how the food is prepared is like that of Subway and Chipotle. Instead of sandwiches or burrito bowls, it's pizza ingredients, and you get to either select a style of pizza or create your own. I choose the latter as it's no extra cost for adding each and every topping.   When crafting your pizza: First, you choose your dough: signature thin crust, double dough, and gluten free (allergy or preference; $2 extra)  Second, you choose which sauces and cheeses you'd like. It's great that they offer the option of vegan daiya cheese, and it's $1 extra when you select it. The employees will even change their gloves when adding the vegan cheese so it doesn't get cross contaminated with the dairy cheeses. It's nice that they're considerate, so if it matters to you, be sure to request for them to do so if they happen to not offer it themselves, which they usually do.  Third, you choose the meats and vegetables, and it's quite a lot of options. As you can see in my picture of the pizza I get, I literally just add all the veggie toppings, and it's awesome that they also offer vegan sausage!  Afterwards, when they start cooking it in the oven, you get to decide whether you want a side such as a cookie, or drinks, and they do offer alcohol such as beer and wine.  Also, where they have all the napkins and utensils, they have a bar full of different kinds of sauces for your pizza with varying levels of how spicy. My personal favorite sauce is the Peach Vidalia, it's a mild, sweet and zesty sauce.  PizzaRev also has its own app where you can do things such as order online so you can just pick it up and not have to wait in line. They have a point system too where each $1 you spend gives you a point and 100 points offers a free pizza. All you have to do is scan the barcode of your receipt or enter the code manually. It'll let you know when you have a free pizza available and let you redeem it. When you're a frequent customer, this is a nice app to have.  The food and the ingredients used is good quality and for what you're paying, you get a reasonable portion. The amount of options they have whether it be pizza toppings, drinks, sides and sauces is nice to have. The atmosphere is a fairly rustic type and rather spacious and open to walk around. They have TV's around the dining area.  The quality of service, in my experience, is usually pleasant. Rare times where miscommunication happens, or things like my pizza getting burnt. Whenever I faced such issues they corrected their mistake with a fresh new pizza and compensated me with a free pizza on my next visit.  Overall, I recommend PizzaRev to pizza lovers, to people looking for vegan options, and to those who simply want convenient and filling food.",

    "text": "So the Pizza market is all out in competition and talk about BYO-Build Your Own Pizza concept in Vegas popping up all over the city. We have Pieology, Blaze and now PizzaRev. Originally we wanted to try Cracker Barrel for dinner but opt to have pizza instead because of the wait time. However I had this place bookmarked for awhile and decided to try this place out. We enjoyed the pizzas we ordered and the salad was descent compared to Pieology. I enjoy thin crust pizza and this was no exception, but you can double up on dough too. It was crispy and flavorful with every bite, our server loaded up on the toppings and made sure if it was ok for us. Most definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area with family or friends and needing a quick and affordable meal. You can't go wrong with a $7.99 pizza! Thanks to Allen M. For the recommendation!  FYI: -Gluten and Vegan items are available. -Organic and Non-GMO sauces. -Bottled Wine & Beer and draft on tap.",

I couldn't even see my options, the worker sighed and had a side conversations with his other coworkers when I wasn't answering them.  Frustrated I just said everything, I couldn't even identify my pizza when that asked was it mine.  No numbers were given to me nor did they ask my name so they could call me for my order.  Funny cause I had the SAME NAME as another customer and we got confused. I heard the workers for other customers saying someone took your pizza.  The customer didn't know  cause they probably couldn't identify their pizza either.  The workers thought it was funny.   I tried to keep my calm and stayed courteous, but it irked me when I would say thank you to some of them and they would totally ignore me.  Other than that the price and food was good.",

Also, their Vegan options make it less of a hassle to find places to eat when I'm with my friends who are Vegan! And they don't charge extra for additional toppings, what a hoot!  Lastly, I love their customer service, on most days I was greeted with a big smile and a loud \"Hi, Welcome!\" right as I entered the door from one of their employees! Other days... not so much.. The bald manager gives a rather unenthusiastic customer service. I mean I've been behind the counter of a restaurant so I get it, there are days where it's extremely busy and stressful (probably on their $6 Tuesday days). But nonetheless, it seems unfair to give off an irritated vibe to customers, especially when the customers are being pleasant to you and are personally not causing you any trouble.. Still overall a well run business, stop by for a try!",

Dude I don't know yet I literally just got here 5 seconds ago!  . It's a little strange but anyhoo...when I got to the front to pay I requested a beer and a glass of wine for my friend. They poured the wine and the dispenser ran out.  We were not given a full serving of wine as a result.  When I mentioned that when I went back to order a second glass the response from the very strange shift lead is \"well The bottle is full again so you'll get a full glass this time\".   Seriously?  On a positive note the barbecue chicken pizza quite good and so was the selection of the beer. However the staff is weird and I won't be going back for that reason.",

I would have liked to see a little more customer/employee interaction and maybe some smiles. I'm not looking for them to walk me through the whole process but a little acknowledgement or a simple suggestion would have been nice. The workers behind the line seemed to just stare and pass along the pizza. Operations doesn't seem efficient as well. I'm glad we came when it was slower. I can only imagine how backed up they get during their rush. When the pizza was handed off to me the workers gave off a bothered vibe. They also seemed to be more concerned about personal matters and we're constantly talking amongst each other.   There was a gentleman constantly in the lobby \"cleaning.\" It would have been nice to see him clean the sneeze guard which was filthy. He kind of was just walking around pointlessly.   A lot of choices for hot sauce which I'm assuming the \"rev\" comes from. Quality was okay and so were the portions. Plenty of toppings to choose from too. The red sauce was great but the white sauce was just a little bland. Nice variety of wine, beers and sodas. The restaurant itself has a nice layout. Honestly the food isn't that memorable.   It's very affordable and you get a decent amount of food. If I were you I'd spend my 8 bucks elsewhere.",

The second time I did the same thing but this time they did at least attempt to build the pizza from the menu.  They were doing great until at the last step when they forgot one thing.  So, when they asked if that was all I offered the missing ingredient: Fennel Seeds.  Aaaaandd, the employee grabbed a handful of capers and covered the pizza with them. These things happen and so I was apologetic about my request to remake it.  I really hate capers.  I paid and sat down assuming they would get it right on the second go at it.

Neither one of us could find a parking spot at 11 in the morning for pizza. We drove around the parking lot for several minutes just waiting. After going in the store we were greeted by somebody saying hello and welcome to PizzaRev very nice. After the first person got my dough and sauce she handed it off to a guy with a goatee that was out of control and looked dirty. I told him which items I wanted on my pizza and he put 3 crumbled mushrooms and approximately 8 to 10 olives on my pizza. Not only is that not enough however he put them all on basically one side of the pizza so three of my pieces of pizza didn't have any toppings. It was then handed over to the pepperoni station which I asked for extra pepperoni and she put 9 pieces of pepperoni on the entire piece of pizza I said I would like extra I'm paying for it and she said oh sorry and put two more pieces on. The multi drink fountain machine was also out of Diet Coke. I know there are many other options however that is what I choose to drink it is more popular and they should keep up on it.",

I heated up my leftovers today in a covered pan and it tasted better than fresh out of their oven!

The employees who handled the food was showing a customer the cheese over the glass, the cheese fell on the top of the glass, then decided to pick it up and throw the cheese back into the fresh cheese instead of disposing it. I wouldn't mind coming back because the food is good, but the employees just need to be more aware of cleanliness and their personal care.",

I might be spoiled growing up in the NY/NJ metro area,but this was pretty lame.I could make better pizza in my toaster oven on an english muffin.Living in Vegas 11 years now,and this is probably the worst I have had.  On top of everything else it takes forever,why does it take 20 minutes to place your order when only 6 or 7 people in line.Employees horribly slow and deliberately stingy with the toppings.  Crust,nothing special and tasteless,Frozen pizza from the lunch line in elementary school is better.Spicy sauce overpowering and you can't taste any toppings.Sauce was super thick like just eating straight tomato paste.EXTREMELY CHEAP WITH THE TOPPINGS.Did all veggie and they put like 2 or 3 pieces of each topping on.What a joke.....What is 3 pieces of basil gonna do?(all 3 pieces maybe equaled 1 basil leaf).Same issue with all toppings.  I guess in an emergency it's certainly edible,But even Little Caesars blows this place away sadly.  Great concept,but horribly executed.Yes,if you look across the street there are MUCH better options that this so called \"pizza\".",

Brandon and the Tuesday crew were THE BEST EVER! They had such high energy right when we came in they welcomed us and when we told them it was our son's birthday they gave us the best birthday experience. They brought him a pizza cake and sang for him even if we didn't ask for it. One of the balloons flew to the high ceiling and they did all they can to get it for us. They gave military discount and thanked my husband for his service. They were fun and helpful to us and everyone. Excellent service, it was clean, and a great deal. I would recommend for all to try it out. Loved the dough, toppings were fresh, awesome experience. May the Lord bless that restaurant for making our son's birthday awesome!",

One of the pizzas was ordered on thicker crust and came out all burnt under. We returned it and were told that this crust burns easier... so what?? if they know about it why not adjust the cooking time appropriately. When making pizza they didn't just brush the crust with little oil... they poured a whole bunch. Pizza was so greasy that my wife couldn't even eat more than 2 tiny slices.   Salads look like an afterthought idea to sell to people that can't have their greasy pizza.   I guess the idea of making your own unlimited topping pizza is great and there is a bunch of the similar type of places opened up recently. It's just PizzaRev failed miserably to deliver on it's fancy promise... I'd go to The Pizza Kitchen any day over this one.",
