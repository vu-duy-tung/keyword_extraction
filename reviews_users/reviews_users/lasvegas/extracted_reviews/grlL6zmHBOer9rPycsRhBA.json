Found Bocho Sushi with 4-1/2 stars, thought we'd try it. 7-8 min walk and it was absolutely more than worth it. From walking in the door, to leaving very satisfied, everyone and everything was fantastic. We had number 5 and Johnny E. Carson specialty rolls and they were delicious. I highly recommend this excellently run establishment. Oh, I almost forgot, as we were walking about a half a block from Bocho Sushi, we heard someone trying to get our attention. It was a young lady employed at Bocho, asking if my husband left his baseball hat. It wasn't ours but that was an very kind thing to do. Just another great part of our visit.",

While there are a lot of restaurant options near Fremont of late, not only is this the only sushi option with out a casino built around it, but it's also top-grade fish with some delicious house recipes.    We stopped in for a late lunch last week & turned out it was happy hour, which just made good prices on quality sushi even better! I like the seating options, you can eat upstairs at a table, a private room, at the bar, or downstairs at the sushi bar & watch the magic happen.    Staff is all very professional & courteous, dining room & bathrooms are not only clean & well stocked, but nicely decorated. Manager Carlos said hello & made sure our meal & beverage options were on point. Garlic edamame, salmon roe, crunch dragon, spicy tuna, & Hawaiian roll (recommend by Mgmnt) were all delicious & left us stuffed but not weighed down, or in need of a nap. Left feeling great & looking forward to our next visit. Keep up the great work Bocho!",

It's said to have been a old hotel back in the day and you can kind of tell. The bottom floor has a few tables and a sushi bar but upstairs has a cool bar and private rooms.  The decor is really beautiful too. On the way up the wood stairs there is a gorgeous silver and white kimono gown and there is amazing wall art, giving it a cozy and hip vibe.  The food itself was pretty tasty. Try the pepper poppers. They aren't spicy at all but they are a fun alternative to edemame. They come with about 5 to 6 and they're awesome with beer. I would Def come here for a fun date night or a cool night out with the girls considering that downtown bars are just around the corner. Will def be going back!",

    "text": "This place was a really nice surprise. I went with some locals who had never heard of it (I found it on Yelp), and they said that this would be their new go-to place for sushi. First, the place was packed -- so I would recommend reservations. I started with some tasty baked mussels and the \"dynamite\" -- a baked dish of scallops, crab, mushrooms, and onions. You couldn't really eat it with the chopsticks, and I would take a pass next time. I asked for tako sunomono, and the waiter seemed confused. I explained that I just wanted octopus on my cucumber salad. Pretty common in most sushi places. When it came it was three large slices of octopus on the cucumber salad. I was trying to figure out why there wasn't the usual dressing on the salad. After digging down I found out, there was lettuce under the large mound of cucumber, and the dressing was at the bottom of the pile. The seaweed salad also had lettuce under it. Odd. Everything else was terrific. I had my usual array of nigiri -- hamachi, salmon, yellow tail, salmon eggs, and toro. I didn't expect to find salmon (sake) this fresh in Vegas, but I think it's probably the best salmon sushi I've had. And this is from someone who lives just outside of Seattle. If you're in Vegas, ditch the strip. Head to Bocho.",

    "text": "Goodbye Bocho....again.  I am a downtown resident. Don't boo hoo as you guys close down one restaurant after another. You suck.  You sucked in the beginning so I never came back. Then I heard there were new people so I gave it a 2nd shot.  I don't have anyone's names, but these servers...sheesh! I don't know if it's arrogance or ignorance but they think they can remember your order without writing it down.  And then they screw up. Their attention span is 0.0.  So if you take my incident as a one time only thing, you'll think I'm over reacting but it's the last three times I've been there.  Owners don't comprehend that people go out for a dining EXPERIENCE. My experiences suck there.  Tonight I sat at bar, ordered 3 of the same type of roll, miso soup, and a cucumber salad. Waitress brought the cucumber salad and I knew just from looking at it, it was old. I took a bite just to be sure. It was awful. I gave it to the guy behind the counter to take away.  At some point he told the waitress so she came over and asked me if I wanted another one. I said no. She brings one anyway. Get the drift? Does this girl pay attention on any level?  Then when my sushi came before my miso soup, I asked about my soup. I said to her, \"did you hear me ask for miso soup?\" She said yes she heard me but forgot. I said, yes because you didn't write it down!  You're servers.  Write shit down! At least TRY to get it right. I mean there were only three customers in the whole place!  So she came over to check on me. I told her I was done with this place. She replied \"everyone makes mistakes\". Not if you write the order down and pay attention!  That's it. I am at my breaking point with this place and every other shitty restaurant here.  This is THE ENTERTAINMENT capital of THE WORLD. People come here from all over the world to go to hospitality school.  Don't think cuz Tony Hsieh throws you some dough that you know how to own a restaurant.  So then she asked if I wanted anything else. I told her I would never be here again. She replies, (in high whiny snotty girl voice) \"OK!\"  So I said, yeah it's ok cuz you don't own the place. She says she does.  Even worse. Good luck chick!",

Most of the food on the strip (even if headlined by some chef).  Though this trip I had a few good experiences and Boncho is definitly one of them.  This place is walking distance from the Freemont experience.  I used the Yelp app to reserve a time for us (but the place wasn't busy).  Service was good and the rolls were both tasty and affordable.",

    "text": "Service was awesome so this review is solely on the food. It was a busy night. There was a banquet upstairs. We ordered a few things to go, garlic edamame, the rajun cajun, rainbow, philly, and Nemo roll. The edamame was good but a little cold, yes we took it to go so I'm assuming that is why. However, the sushi was cut haphazardly. The fish itself wasn't cut with any skill or finesse. They were all placed on top of the rolls messy and not even whatsoever. The quality was underwhelming. The sauces used were overly oily. The sushi rice had no flavor. Overall completely dissatisfied with the food. I can't believe people like eating here. Please go anywhere else and you will find better quality and presentation. Take some pride in your work and fix it please. The potential is there I just can't believe how disappointed I was.",

We sat at the sushi bar and had a wonderful experience because of Chef Daniel.  He creates beautiful art with fresh, thick cut fish.  This meal was our best meal in Vegas but is also one of our best sushi experiences.    We ordered uni, salmon roe, halibut from South Korea, blue fin tuna from Spain, yellow tail, mackerel, and the Something Wrong roll which is the chef's choice roll.  This roll was almost too pretty to eat!   This will be our first stop on our next trip to Vegas.  Don't go if your pressed for time. Sit at the sushi bar, relax, order a drink, and put full trust in Chef Daniel.",

Their miso soup was up to par. And their fried chicken appetizer was good with soy sauce and rice. I can't do the sauce it came with cuz of the spiciness. The rock shrimp appetizer was good too!

While this may not be unique to Bocho, the charge for \"real\" crab may be.  At first the less-than-knowledgeable waitress stated that the \"upcharge\" would be $5 per piece, she then returned with an updated amount...$40 for the roll.  Holy Crab, Batman!  So, a roll that supposedly has \"crab\" in it is $12 on the menu but when you ask for \"real\" crab (instead of the ocean's version of a hot dog, aka, imitation crab meat or surimi), it jumps to $52?  That better be some DAMN GOOD CRAB MEAT!!!!    We had the Pink Lady roll and that was fine, nothing too special.  We also had the Tempura Shrimp...same thing, it was fine...same as you can get anywhere.  We ordered a roll that had crispy garlic pieces on top (not noted on the menu, BTW) and it was absolutely disgusting!  Of course, we sent it right back and then at the end of the meal, the waitress informed us that it was \"taken off the bill.\"  Gee, thanks...um, we sent it back, so I would not have expected to have to pay for it.    Almost forgot to mention, we were mildly pressured to eat at the sushi bar downstairs and had to reiterate twice to the hostess that we preferred to sit upstairs.  Kind of strange.  Choosing this place for a special occasion was a mistake...live and learn, right?  If anyone knows of a Sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas area that DOES NOT include \"surimi\" in their rolls...please let me know!  Thanks.",

Parking already paid.   I understand if you change the hours of operation to accommodate demand but please let your customers know and change the message on the machine. It leaves a bad taste in your (potential) customer's, especially when they are left hungry for sushi. Not good when starting a new business.",

Most importantly the service was very friendly and efficient.",

Normally Bubs and I do AYCE (not available here btw) because we can throw down when it comes to sushi. Here we shared 4 rolls and were stuffed.   I HIGHLY recommend the \"Something Wong\" roll. Basically, it's whatever the chef feels like concocting customized with things you like. Ours turned out being a seared (with a blowtorch! So cool to watch) yellow tail & salmon roll with spicey mayo, a smokey glaze, a little cream cheese and avocado. Panty dropper. Oh sweet baby Jesus it was good. We saved the plate to dip the rest of our rolls in the remaining sauce.   We sat at the bar and got great service. Ended up staying longer than anticipated because we were chatting with our server. Also ended up being part of a group Sake bomb. Next time I'm in town and craving sushi I will be coming back to Bochos.",

It wasn't packed, but it took about 30 minutes to get our food, and the prices were quite steep.  I ordered the Bocho lunch box, which came with 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of Nigiri, tempura, miso soup, and rice. My friend ordered the Shunga box which came with 4 pieces of california roll, choice of black cod, salmon, or mackerel, tempura, rice, and miso soup.   They were out of the black cod which she wanted, so she ordered the salmon. Our tempura was NOT equally portioned, she had heaping pieces of shrimp, yams, onion, etc. and I had a few onions and 1 shrimp. My sushi and sashimi were all tuna, yellowtail and salmon, which were unfortunately not quite flavorful, and on the smaller side. I ordered Uni sushi which wasn't bad, but was $9.50!!! The other sushi places I usually go to are usually around $7.   We didn't get a ton of food and it was well over $50.00 for the two of us. I was thrilled DT had a sushi joint, but I'm underwhelmed for now.",

Tried a lot of different things and was especially impressed by the Chicken Karaage (might be the best I've ever eaten), the salmon belly and yellowtail belly nigiri, and Bocho's signature martini - the 'Bocho-tini': a delicious cucumber-ish martini.  Had the Jalapeno Bomb as recommended by our server. I can see how people might love it if they're into that yum-yum sauce / dynamite kind of thing - I'm not particularly fond of this style of American sushi fusion, but again, I can see how people might go crazy for it. Pretty damn tasty, but not my thing.  Garlic Shishito peppers were great - lightly tempura'd and dusted with a mildly spicy paprika-like powder.   This is a cool, cozy sushi bar space. I know people have expressed their fondness for the upstairs, but I like how it feels sort of 'cozy Greenwich Village sushi spot' downstairs. A very social atmosphere. I found myself having conversations with other parties along the sushi bar. It'd be almost hard not to because of the way the place is set up - acoustically the raftered ceilings dampen the overall restaurant noise - it's pleasant and makes for a enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere.   Looking forward to doing AYCE here in the future!",

I read reviews and decided to give this restaurant a try. Here's the Pros  -They take reservations! I called in and they were happy to take a party of 9 for the same night.  A lot of AYCE places don't take reservations. -menu was extensive you can either order ala carte, or 30$ for all you can eat.  I would recommend the all you can eat, it's worth it. -The AYCE menu is huge and the sushi was Very fresh and tasty. They don't serve lots of rice and a small fish on top to fill you up, it was opposite the rice was small and the fish was a big portion. great deal. The fisherman in our group gave their thumbs up on the quality.   -We had a really nice private room for our group and we had Free Karaoke!  I asked about this and it's free when ordering 100$ or more, this was no problem for us. We had a great night eating, drinking and singing till closing. -Lastly this place opened 6 months ago so it's new and nicely decorated. -over all great sushi place that's close to downtown  The only Con was that the area that it was in didn't look so Hip from the outside, but inside it was awesome!!  We'll be here again next trip to Vegas",

    "text": "I have to start by admitting that I am generally an all-you-can-eat fan. I like sushi in all forms, but my usual mood is \"give me everything you have until I want to die because I am so full of fish.\" These places, I am aware, offer more food of less quantity. Bocho sushi is the opposite; you may not get a ton of food, but the quality is excellent! This spot does not offer all you can eat. I came here for dinner with a friend because we had a $25 off coupon. Due to my normal stance on sushi restaurants, I was pretty sure this would be my one and only time eating here, and I was absolutely wrong! I really enjoyed my meal, and I will definitely be back.   First off, the atmosphere is a small, hip place with an upstairs loft and downstairs sushi bar. We sat at the bar, but we did walk up to look at the loft - it was enticing, but I wanted some of that real sunshine the downstairs area provided. When you sit at the sushi bar, you can see everything they are doing, which is cool. Unfortunately, when I was there it did not look very organized compared to other sushi bars I have sat at. Also, my waiter did not refill my water for almost half an hour, and it was not a busy day/time. This led to what might be called a funny mistake, as a random man walked up to us and asked us if the food was up to par. I assumed he was the manager and replied that it was, but I have not gotten any water since we sat down, and he looked very confused! It turned out he was just some creep talking to us. He came by a few more times and asked us about our food, even though he was just a customer, as we were. It was weird, to say the least, but a good story to laugh about!   THAT FISH THOUGH!! I tried yellowtail first, and I was hooked. Every piece was so buttery and smooth. All together I ordered a Screaming Orgasm, some edamame, two orders of sushi, and a Rainbow Roll. Together it came out to almost double the price I pay for eight times the amount of food at my regular spot. However, this food was at least twice as fresh and amazing, so I'm not mad about it! I ordered the Rainbow Roll specifically because after trying the yellowtail I knew I needed something with a lot of fish on it, minus some of the extreme toppings on other rolls that cover the flavor. I probably won't be a regular, but I will come back for a quick fix when I am craving some buttery amazing sushi/rolls or maybe on a special occasion when I am looking to up my sushi game.   Quick Summary: Relatively expensive, but the food is bomb.",

I felt like a little more consideration could have gone into the plates. I don't care for the cheap, plastic plates you can buy at your local asian grocery (in fact, I think 168 probably has better choices). The tables are also a little too small for the long plates the sushi comes on.   Service is ok. The server was nice to start, but she took a very long time to bring our water and an even longer time to bring drinks. She did not check in on us after the food was brought either.  For appetizers, we chose Seaweed Salad and the Jalapeno Bomb (jalapeno stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese). The salad came with a mix of romaine lettuce, which seemed a little weird and filler-ish. The stuffed jalapeno was good for it's uniqueness, but by no means life changing.  Bocho Special Roll (tuna/crab/cucumber with shrimp tempure/crab/assorted fish on top), it was basically a glorified California roll. It was way too big to eat in one bite and it didn't leave any lasting impressions.  Sashimi was fresh, with large pieces. We ordered Garlic Tuna, Yellowtail, and Super White Tuna. We ended up receiving regular tuna, instead of garlic, which isn't the end of the world, but a little disappointing.  I don't really see how this place can be given 5 stars. It makes me wonder what the other reviewers think is good sushi... It's really not \"as good as it gets,\" when there are so many better restaurants out there. I'm happy to see downtown expanding their culinary tastes, but Bocho has a long way to go before they are the best.",

From good music to the game on the TV. If you are looking for a cool spot to go with friends I recommend checking this place out and hanging out upstairs  Also this place is on ItsOnMe so you can buy a friend a drink or bite to eat here right from your phone or their website in just a few clicks",

With a spontaneous date night in Vegas underway, we scurried out of the cold and into Bocho and so happy we did! It's located in the coolest part of Vegas, in my opinion, in Fremont East. Awesome graffiti! Perfect venue!   We were greeted by several friendly faces and a beautiful sushi bar! The waiter's, hostess and sushi chefs cheer was so magnetic. It made us instantly more happy! There's such a great trendy feel about the place. There's fantastic and colorful art on the walls. And two levels! Lower level is where the sushi bar is located and upstairs is where the dining room and bar is hiding.  My husband and myself tried four different kinds of sushi. One better than the next! I loved both of mine! The traditional Spicy Tuna and (a random grab located in the appetizers) the Jalapeno Bomb! The Bomb is a seeded jalapeno stuffed with tuna, deep fried and topped with two different sauces. Savory, slightly spicy and I am still having dreams about it!!!!   Their sushi selection is fantastic. The fish is so delicious and fresh!   Man! Take me back please!!",

I usually just go to Yellow tail at Bellagio Hotel or Blue Ribbon at the Cosmopolitan and spend well over 100 and sometimes even two hundred dollars. I am really glad I went off the strip.The food was really good. As I walked to the bldg it doesn't look like much but from the beginning the service was great! I love Shishito peppers and will order them every chance I get. This place has a simple seasoning they use and those were the best peppers I have ever had. I also ordered the tempura shrimp, was really good so I had a couple orders. I also loved the Yellow tail jalapeno. What was truly amazing after enjoying this great food and having a couple beers, I learned it was happy hour and got 30% my tab. I haven't seen it get better than that in Vegas for sushi!",

Sushi delicious and artistically crafted, sashimi fresh and generously sliced, udon bowls steaming tasty with tempura shrimp accompaniment--we all loved our meals! Restaurant very neat and clean, contemporary design with full bars on both floors, staff friendly and answered all questions knowledgeably, arigato thank you when we left was nice touch! Prices very reasonable considering mostly seafood and excellent quality--everyone in our party agreed it was great! Located in revitalized part of downtown Vegas so cleaner and felt safe, lots of pay parking on street, small corner location so missed it on our first pass. We need to stop by Bocho Sushi again very soon!",

We had a huge party and they accommodated us easily. Side note: you can rent karaoke rooms!!  Wish we'd have known! Go for the fancy rolls, the basic spicy tuna and such is fresh and wonderful, but they really take the cake with the specialty rolls. Wow! The crunch dragon roll and Yellowtail lover?  Are you kidding me?!  so good!!",

    "text": "How have I never heard of this place?  As a native I am very keen to find places that make me feel like I am not in Vegas or in Vegas as a city not as a tourist attraction.  This is place was marvelous. Upstairs has the perfect decor with the bare cinder blocks and the raw wood. The one open window let the chilly air and the sounds of the city. I look forward to coming back and eating through the menu again. They were very giving on any changes we wanted to make or ordering things not really on the menu and the prices were reasonable. I am very happy. The food was delicious, the serving staff was amazing..especially the bus boy who overheard us talking about the menu and on offered us their \"chicken nuggets\"...he said two words...dark meat, and I was hooked. They were amazing and a fine alternative if you don't like fish and your friends are dragging you to sushi...or if you're a normal person and love adult chicken nuggets...white meat be damned.  The quality is superb. I have eaten in some places that charge many times more for what they are serving and it cannot come close to what is done here. The rolls do not come very quickly, but incredibly reasonably, and each roll is worth its weight in gold. I highly recommend rock n roll and the roll 5...or something with a 5 in it, my taste buds blocked my memory. I could go on and on, their Ocean Trout was unlike anything I have ever tasted and their sushi tacos appetizer makes me want to steal their recipe book.  The sauces are not the main focus of the dish like most other sushi places nowadays, they are a gentle complement to enhance, not to take over, the experience. Easily, my new favorite sushi place. Thank you! I'll be a regular especially at happy hour with 30% off.  And...they have real, freshly grated wasabi available and a wonderful saki selection. Take a moment to leave what you know as Vegas aside and see what Vegas looks like from a local perspective...",

The tostada was large but the fish on top was small, horrible fish to tostada ratio. Also was topped off with lots of mayo sauce and super hard to eat. Didn't taste fresh at all.  Next was the fried calamari with Japanese marinara. Calamari was ok in terms of tenderness but flavor was lacking. The marinara was really bad, over salted and clumpy, almost impossible to dip into as the sauce was way too thick. After this, didn't even bother to try the sushi.  Final item was the mushroom yaki. Zero seasoning and only can taste the butter.  Tried to order a drink after putting in my starters but the waitress never came back to check on me even though there were 2 servers for 7 people. When I asked for my check, she attempted to clear my plates but got some of the thick marinara on my clothes. Never said sorry. When I walked out the door, not even the sushi chefs said a word of goodbye or thank you.  Only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the decor. I hate to right bad reviews but need to warn others before they make the same mistake as me.",

The place was crowded, but far from packed, with several open seats at the bar and several open tables upstairs.  There was no one to check anyone in and there was a pile of people waiting downstairs (where there is really no where to wait).  We waiting about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged, but eventually escorted to a table.  After 10 minutes of sitting down drink orders were taken.  Although the wait staff seemed very very short handed, there seemed to be plenty of people buzzing around.  The appetizer, which was a special was mediocre.  It was slightly too spicy for me, but overall not bad.  Our food took about 25 minutes to be ready... no big deal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us, they got their drinks, appetizers, and meal prior to us (they also ordered the same specialty rolls as us, uncooked).  When they brought my meal, it had jalapenos on it, which I had specifically asked to leave out.  They brought my husband the wrong roll all together (glad he noticed initially).  I tried my roll, and it was definitely full of large chunks of jalapenos.  It took over 20 minutes at least to try and change it, but there was really no one around to tell.... my husband finished his meal, and we still waited and waited.  I do not send food back, this has been the first time in years.  My husband said his meal was decent, but nothing special.   The soy sauce....  they WATER down their soy sauce... who does this????  We frequent sushi/Japanese restaurants at least once per week.   The consistency of their soy sauce was 3 parts water, 1 part soy sauce.    Like most restaurants they probably refill their bottles on the table.  Whatever brand they use is either much much more dilute, or they water it down.  Unbelievable!!!",

I think this deal was better than the AYCE because the AYCE didn't seem too wide of selections. Plus the AYCE is $28. If I'm going to spend that much on AYCE, I expect their menu choices to be more. My friend and I shared 3 rolls with a mushroom yaki order for our appetizer. We got the Ryan, Poke Monster, and Dirty Sanchez rolls. They were all delicious. It was packed with rice, plenty of fish, and flavor. I like how they put the tuna and seaweed salad on top of the poke monster. It made it unique and more flavorful. There is a kick in the dirty sanchez roll. I think there's a small jalapeno in it so watch it if you're not expecting spicy or a kick. The mushroom yaki appetizer was simple. It was sliced mushroom  drowned in butter. Yummm butter. We were so full and we didn't even finish our rolls. I had to take a little bit home. It definitely fills you up and all of this was only $35! Split it between 2 people was $17-18 a person which I think in my opinion is a better deal than the $28 for AYCE. I saw the people next to me do AYCE and they ordered less than us and didn't eat their moneys worth. Overall I definitely recommend coming here for happy hour and getting their rolls.",

Other delicious choices are Ragin' Cajun, that has a yummy seared flavor to it, Something Wrong, where the chef decides what to put in based on your likes, and Daniel. Service was a little slower on a Saturday night, as they're obviously much busier, but it was still very good. Sitting at the sushi bar is fun, and the sushi chefs are nice and have lots of personality. This place is in downtown Vegas, which is nice being off the strip. It's definitely our favorite sushi place and I'm sure you won't be disappointed here.",

As we walked in we were greeted by a nice young man that promptly seated us, he turned out to be our waiter as well. He was very attentive, polite and had a great smile. We ordered sashimi and were amazed with the quality and presentation. After the sashimi we had the Spanish Mackeral and then a Lobster,Crab Roll they were amazing. If you are a beer drinker try the Asahi on tap, it was sooo cold and refreshing and  went great with the sushi. The finishing touch was their tempura fried ice cream that is wrapped in pound cake. Holy Shit !   I found out that this place is owned by the same owner of Le Thai that is located right around the corner. We had lunch at Le Thai the day before and it was just as good. The guy who owns these two gems knows what's up with quality food and great service not to mention the vibe in his restaurants is on point.  Bocho is hidden so just look for the John E. Carson Hotel sign and you are there.",

Sushi bar is on the bottom floor when you walk in, and the tables and a small bar with the karaoke rooms are on the top floor. Waitress and the gentleman who helped her serve the food were attentive, although maybe slightly slow in refilling my soda.  The place is small- maybe about 9 tables. All except maybe 2 were full when we arrived at 9:30. Check in and get free sake!  The yellowtail jalapeno was my favorite. The side dish of steamed rice is plenty for two people to share. The chicken karaage was delicious as well as the beef gyoza, although my BF thinks it was a bit on the soggy side. We went with the typical rainbow roll and loved it. Sushi was fresh and the yellowtail dish was sliced perfectly. We would definitely come back next time we're in town. The price was extremely reasonable!",

My wife's plate was brought to her some 20 min before I ever received my food. She had finished well before I even received my own order. It did not escape me that another party who arrived and placed their orders at least 15 min after we did, ordered the same thing as myself. The chef preparing food at the bar in front of me, simply waited and did the dishes at the same time. I sat through the whole lunch watching my wife finish her meal before mine came out, at the exact moment the other party's meals were delivered.  No apology at all, nothing said before we paid our bill and left.  Moreover, my sushi and sashimi combo was entirely average at best. A fair price but disappointing nonetheless. Only days ago I had been enjoying delicious sashimi from some of my favorite places in California. Avoid this place. There are other options with better service.",

While he is typically rude, he reminds me of the sushi Nazi in L.A. but he is worse. I was the only customer and in 15 minute sitting 4 feet away from him and his work area, he completely ignored the concept that I was there to eat sushi. No acknowledgment, not even a glance as he continued to wipe his unused knives over and over and over, wiping down and organize all of his condiment bottles, wrapped a cucumber that was wedged under his cutting board and toss it into the refrigerator while nudging other items inside the fridge with his foot before closing the door. Final straw... with still no sushi service, three new customers were sat next to me and he focused on them serving the ASAP. That's it!!! I paid my tea/miso/soy bean order the waiter brought me. Before leaving I put a penny on the counter and related to the rude sushi dude that this penny was for his service (he deserved less). He then picks up his sushi knife and abruptly mimes aggression thrusting the blade towards me. WOW this guy is bad news.",

I ordered the Ryan Special. Soooo good! Our sushi chef prepared 3 different \"Something Wrong\" rolls for us (the menu says chef's choice), and each of them was delicious! He was even kind enough to ask and make sure we had no allergies of any sort before preparing the rolls.  After serving us our food, he began to filet a whole salmon on the counter. As he was about to throw away the salmon head, he joked and asked if any of us wanted it. To his surprise, a friend of mine wanted it and the chef was gracious to wrap it up with ice for my friend! Now we can say that my friend got free head from Bocho Sushi!",

We were walked upstairs and that space was equally as great as the sushi bar downstairs. Service was good too.   I noticed that the lunch specials were really expensive on paper, $16-18 for their sushi plates but we ordered them anyway as the reviews for this place were great. Presentations were very nice & you did receive a lot of food. The fish was fresh & each plate came with a few pieces of sashimi which were really good but everything else that had rice was nearly inedible. The rice was mushy and packed so hard that each piece was really heavy. I couldn't get passed that.   I had high hopes & wanted to love my experience because I genuinely enjoyed the space but the rice ruined it for me and let's be honest, the rice is just as important as what comes on it or in it when it comes to sushi.",

We've had some pretty good sushi from some pretty good places and Bocho is one of them now. Presentation was beautiful and sushi was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!! We ordered Flyin Hawaiian, Ryan Special and the Jack Truffle. And we devoured all of them within minutes! I definitely recommend this place. The only tiny bit of a downer is the servers. They all seem to be a bit lost. Overall, the sushi made up for it!",

TOO quick where it kinda felt like the waitress was trying to rush me in to ordering cause she was so busy. The place was dead on a friday afternoon only 2 tables had people and the bar which is downstairs had 2-3 siting there. ( not gonna knock off any stars since she was really nice)   food was great! We ordered the tofu, salmon roll, spicy tuna roll and the flying hawaiian. compared to california sushi the prices are pretty expensive, for all of those plus 2 drinks we paid about 55 before tip which for 2 cali girls was kinda steep since we are so spoiled with good cheap sushi. Even thought it was pricey I would def come back if I was in town.",

    "text": "Not happy. Was recommended by a friend that lives around the corner. The sushi bar was full, well, full enough that there wasn't two empty seats next to each other for me and this friend to sit at. So, we had to go upstairs. Bar had two seats. I guess I'll order some sake then, great. What else can I do since I'm unable to get sushi upstairs. This was the first time meeting with this friend. It took 2 bottles of sake to finally get a seat back downstairs. I made my way downstairs and asked the server there to bring my sake, that was just opened, to the sushi bar. He actually refused with a half lame excuse that they \"probably\" already threw it out. Like the 10 guests to 10 employees was just overwhelming and he couldn't go and get my 15 dollar bottle of sake. And I was with someone. What a horrible attitude from this runt. Then it took another extra long seemed like forever time to even place an order for sushi. 3 bottles, 2 rolls, and seaweed salad for 100 bucks and absolutely horrible service...yeah, I'll pass.  Edit : looks like an employee responded to me. As you can see, he doesn't even address the complaints. He tries to tell me they are popular? Oh, ok...good luck. I'm popular too. This links to my Facebook that gets plenty of attention. Little tip: you should not excuse your employees mistakes because you THINK you are popular. Btw, if you read, I mentioned there were 10 guests at the time. If that makes you feel popular, see you in 3 years. Oh, and one of the main complaints is that the little server, who had 2 couple groups (that's it), couldn't make 'my stay as pleasant as possible.' In case you don't understand customer service, that means bringing the just opened bottle to location guest is sitting. Wow. Good luck on being popular :)",

    "text": "So decided to have dinner here last night and it turned out to be a great choice.  We came in a little before closing and were welcomed by the friendly staff and amazing sushi chef.   The menu is pretty simple. Nothing to outrageous and they have plenty for everyone's tastes. Not a whole lot of specialty rolls like the other places but a good selection.   We went with the yellowtail lover roll and the China roll. Both were pretty tasty. The rolls themselves are slightly smaller than some other sushi joints but packed full of flavor. The spicy tuna on the China roll was excellent. Some places butcher their spicy tuna and it loses it flavor but they did it right.   We also had the Screaming O which was my friends favorite. It's seared tuna with shredded radish and this amazing sauce. The whole fish is right on point.  We had a few selection of nigiri and let the chef decide on that. His selections were fresh and tasty even for being closing time.  The whole staff was friendly and attentive and that goes a long way in my book.",

It has a pink wrap instead of seaweed and it has cubed a mango and veggies on top and it's the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I absolutely love it. Last night we had the garlic edamame. It was garlicky and delicious. We also had the chefs special which was very thinly sliced fish with truffle oil and a delicious florally kind of sauce. We also had a surprise Roll that had orange slices and it was just incredible. The sushi chefs here are unique, they are playful with their flavors, and always super nice and friendly. We usually sit at the sushi bar because the sushi chefs actually enjoy speaking to their diners. Unlike with some others to she shops where they don't really speak to you. And the prices cannot be beat. On my last visit we ordered for rolls and a Edamame side and it was $52! That cannot be beat! The fish is fresh and food delicious",

Walking down 6th street I was a little concerned about what I maybe walking into (a little rough looking on the outside). But as soon as we walked in we found the place to be very nice inside. The service was good and the food great. We had miso soup, the fried stuffed jalapenos, #5, pink lady and yellowtail lover. The #5 was our favorite. The fried onion joints on top were great. The plank lady was good. The pink lady was one of the most unique rolls, in a good way, I have ever had. Highly recommend this place.",

Lately we've been hearing some negative comments from friends whose opinion I respected especially when it comes to Japanese cuisine.  Well tonight Mrs, youngest daughter and I had a  disappointing dinner.  We were staying at the Orleans and had dinner at the ondori last nite and we're surprised with quality of the fresh seafood, especially the uni, sake and tuna selections.  At Bocho we waited a while to order our drinks and sashimi. The sashimi was presented before our drinks arrived so I waited a few minutes so that I could enjoy the ice cold Japanese beer with the sashimi.  I waited far too long and had never in all my life had such terrible service. The quality of the sashimi was definitely lacking and there was very little conversation between the sushi chef and the customers.  I tried to make conversation with both sushi chefs but was not successful.  It was 6:30 and they were out  of uni and kumbachi, but we were charged for them. Sad to say that Bocho will not be on our Las Vegas restaurant list when we visit twice each year nor will we be recommending it to anyone.  Sayonara!",

Then we had the Pokemon roll (my favorite) the dirty Sanchez, the Hawaiian and the ragin Cajun. All delicious.  The place is two stories. First is just the sushi bar then upstairs had tables.  I did only see one bathroom upstairs..  But all in all, super good sushi with good service and a clean restaurant.",

Seats were comfortable, the sushi chefs were personable and knew their stuff.  We ordered:  Hamachi kama (Bocho bites menu = very tasty and my first kama), the 6th and Carson roll (excellent!), Something Wrong (chef's choice - excellent!).  Chef asked us what we wanted and he made a roll then drenched it in Screaming Orgasm sauce = YUM!  We also ordered nigiri consisting of the following:  blue fin tuna (a special), Hamachi, escolar and unagi - all fresh and tasty.    Restroom was clean.  Public parking available just north of Bocho and across the street, currently $2 per hour.  I recommend you check it out!",

The place is a bit loud, but I guess that is expected for a hipster place.   Disclaimer: I am not much of a sushi guy, so I got non-fish things. (My boss wanted to try this place.).  The cons:   I did not get utensils or napkins until I asked for them.   In the bento box: The pork belly seems like just some pork that was pre-cooked and just charred to heat. The salad was way overdressed.   The ramen noodle bowl was for some reason cloudy and spicy.   The tempura was really heavy.   The pros:  The place is super hipster. If you want to do a photo shoot, this is the way to go. I hear they have a private room for karaoke and that sounds like fun.   They also have Happy Hour which is 30% off the menu",

We started with the calamari and it had a great taste and a good batter. My wife also loves Edamama, so we had to try that too. Although I am normally not a huge fan of Edamama, Bocho's was seasoned really well and something I would order again. My wife ordered the disco inferno roll and it was delicious. I had the Golden Philly and although it was good, I didn't love it. It was the first time I ordered sushi, with no rice and I wasn't crazy about it. I will definitely be back to try a different speciality roll and some other apps.",

    "text": "Remember that 2 stars means, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  And 3 stars is, \"A-OK.\" Sadly, I can't say my encounter with Bocho Sushi was \"A-OK.\"  I was disappointed, and in fact, a little embarrassed that I dragged a work colleague here.  To be candid, as much as I really am sheepish about leaving a low-stars review, the \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is the distinct impression I got from my visit to Bocho.  That was in terms of food, service, and environment.  I was put off immediately by the greeting I received, which was less than warm, and seemed as though I had made a gaffe in asking to go upstairs to what I knew (from Yelp reviews) to be where the dining room was.  It is not permitted before 6pm, and for \"Happy Hour,\" one has to sit at the bar.  And the \"hostess\" said it as though EVERYBODY knows this.  And she chided us as if I had asked to use the restroom in a five-star dining room, coming off the street, when I was not even dining there.  Whatever, lady!  I didn't even know or remember you had a \"Happy Hour.\"  I wasn't there for Happy Hour.  I was there for Happy Dining! And happily leaving hunger behind...that's all. Sheesh.  It did not get a whole lot better.  The bar seating was cramped, with too many bar stools stuffed together (though the bar stools were really cool, stylish and a trendy orange). Most of our fellow diners were REALLY (I mean, extremely) friendly with the \"sushi\" chefs, who did not seem to hold the intense, studied expression of the average sushi chef, but maybe that's because they had to withstand these middle-aged ladies who were openly flirting with them, instead of focusing on what they were doing.  (Hey, I \"ain't mad\" at them, but a little attention on what you're doing would work, too.  And it's okay to be happy and love what you do! Most sushi chefs really get into preparing the food--but I didn't see that here).  It appeared to me that this was a fun hang-out for those who already are \"regulars.\"  The lady next to me went on and on about sushi \"chef\" #1's haircut: \"Oh my! What a nice haircut you have! I love the swoosh on the side! When did you get it cut?\" And so on, and so on.  That was going on all around us.  It's quaint, don't get me wrong.  But it was weird when not one of the sushi chefs--who were making our food--bothered to engage us, or smile in our direction, or ask how we were enjoying the food.  We definitely got the feeling that we were outsiders.  The server who chided us for asking about upstairs dining did not help much in introducing us to the menu despite our saying that we were new there, and asking for help.  So we muddled through it.  The food was lackluster.  I ordered the yellowtail with jalapeno.  (Bocho is a Mexican Japanese fusion idea.  Very cool concept.  Bocho=\"Mexican who cannot speak Spanish,\" or at least that is what the sign on the side of the building says).  The dish was very pretty, but the fish was a little warm, and did not strike me as super fresh.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, and if I am, my apologies.  But I have had fresher sushi at  Smith's, no offense.  (The Smith's on W.Charleston has really good sushi, by the way!)  The \"Poke Monster\" was all show.  Sure, the poke & seaweed on top were fine (again, the fish part, the poke, did not taste super, super fresh as expected), and the tempura was fine, if a little dull and over breaded (I think the oil might not be hot enough), but it did not bring the spice it promised from the menu, and I did not taste the crab at all.  I wondered if it made it on the dish?  The little bean sprouts or noodles or whatever at the base of the dish were not a good taste at all.  It gave a sour note. The little \"edible flower\" that came on top, an orchid, didn't seem too edible!  It was dry and hard to eat...and I've eaten those before.  My colleague did not enjoy dinner, either.  Our drinks were not replenished, but food was taken away before we were done.  The music was really loud, and a bit more chaotic than should be played for a serious sushi place.  (Please see the excellent and entertaining documentary, \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" and you will know what I mean).    Worse, when I went to the restroom, I was a little put off by the lack of attention to it.  It was not filthy by any means, but it was not sparkling clean as I would expect for a place where RAW FISH is served.  For instance, the sink was a little grimy, the walls needed cleaning, and the light fixture, I would not touch without a towel.  I went recently to \"Sweet Box,\" a dessert shop in Chinatown (with Japanese owners, I believe), and their bathroom was so clean, you might not even be grossed out having your dessert in there! I expect at least that much from a place that sells sushi.  All in all, not a good experience for me.  I do think it could be nice for tourists, and even locals who can invest the time into becoming a \"regular,\" especially if they are drinking! Could have just been a bad night.",

The Dragon Crunch roll has an amazing amount of different flavor profiles.  Easy to get to, just around the corner from the Fremont Experience on 6th. You will do yourself a disservice if you miss it.   Update: 17 May 2019 I hate to say it, but this place has gone downhill. They haven't finished the interior, stuff laying around, but it's the product that I have issues with. No presentation, none, zero. Just lay your sushi on a plate. Not the way it's supposed to be guys.",

I had to ask three times.  One waitress just said, no (she wasn't our waitress, but still) 4. The price was not worth the quality.  It's way over priced.  There's so many other places that are so much better especially in Vegas.    Party of 6 for a birthday celebration. On average from our party of six ranked it a 3.5 star.

I normally sit at the sushi bar as the chef's are always very approachable and their service is incredibly fast.  I highly recommend trying their Shishito peppers and the Salmon Skin Roll ($5.50) is a great value.  My favorite two specialty rolls are the No. 5 (Crab, cucumber, avocado, cajun albacore, spicy tuna topped with crispy onions) and the Yellowtail lover (yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, spicy yellowtail).  When the crispy onions melt into the soy/yuzo sauce, you will ask for a spoon to shovel the tangy delicious mixture into your feed hole.",

The place is clean, and the staff are friendly for the most part. It is small, so it fills up quickly! The menu items are ok, but some things on the menu are seriously overpriced for the portions and quality (unless you get a bento box - those are a good price and you get a good amount of food). The shrimp tempura roll, Crunch Dragon, and the Rock & Roll are all good. That isn't my issue.  The issue is that when they ask \"miso soup or salad,\" and you order miso soup instead of salad, you are charged extra. Several in our party had the same issue, and attempted to rectify the issue prior to paying. So the waitress left with our checks to correct them - and never came back! And when I mean never, I mean close to 45 minutes! Being on lunch from work this a) made us all late getting back to the office, b) ensured that we will not be going to Bocho again, and c) did not bode well in the customer service department. I believe that everyone has bad days, but when you leave to correct an issue and it takes nearly an hour for you to come back so that we can pay, there might be a problem. A big one.",

I ordered a basic roll and a specialty roll. Took about an hour to get. The flavors were very bland. Usually i don't ever use soy sauce but i had to drown the rolls in soy sauce just to get some kind of flavor. They get 2 stars because their seaweed salad portion was decently sized. But heavy on the sesame oil. Wont come back and wont recommend.",

    "text": "So I wanted to find an awesome AYCE  sushi place closer to the house.  I looked on Yelp and found the place closed at 10:30 and I knew I was going to be cutting it close.  So I called and spoke with a Carlos and asked what time the last seating was, just to make sure I wasn't imposing.  Most places will set their final seating an hour before they really mean to close.  Kaya Sushi for example close at 3am on most days so they set their final seating at 2:15am.  Well Carlos, told me their final seating was 10:15 pm, so I was off.  I get to the downtown area and find a parking spot about a block away, which is as expected.  I paid for my parking spot and headed to Bocho Sushi.  I walked in and there were still about a dozen people in the place in various phases of their meal. I checked the time and thought awesome I made it (10:14pm). I ask the host if I can eat at the bar and she begins to seat me.  I start getting settled in and she asked if I was there for all you can eat or ala carte.  I stated all you can eat...  And she began telling me about it when one of the chefs said, No!  No, all you can eat after 10:15.  The hostess seemed somewhat surprised at this and briefly questioned it before apologizing and offering the ala carte menu.  But since I am on a mission to find a closer AYCE I declined.  I might try this place again but for two employees to seem to think it was ok for AYCE only to be over ruled by the chef after the customer looked for parking and paid for parking not to mention took the time and energy to give the establishment a try for the first time is somewhat unacceptable in my opinion, not to mention the communication breakdowns.    Now let me just clarify for those who will say yeah but with big parties I would want to serve super late either....  Well, I was by myself so it wasn't like I was entertaining a large party.  I was on a mission, so to speak!  Lol.   Well, back to the drawing board on the mission.  As they say in Football...  Next man (AYCE Place in this case) up.",

After this having been on our list for a few months to try, we were extremely disappointed.  While the staff was attentive and great and we went on a Friday night and it was empty with one other customer.  The sushi itself was very subpar.  The rice was gummy and crunchy. The sea weed wraps were tough and gummy and chewy.  A few bites nearly felt like chewing gum and I think the fish itself at one time was rubbery.  I have not even eaten grocery store sushi, but I imagine it might be better.  I have had good sushi, I know I am somewhat a snob, but this was no where near the best anything.  It was not authentic in any way.  Nor was the staff.   If Taco Bell is your favorite Mexican.  This place is for you.",

Definitely recommend!",

You have the option to dine at the sushi bar on the first floor or the main dining room on the second floor. The second floor is also where they have the private rooms for karaoke (I have yet to try). The restaurant is clean and new having just opened this year. Japanese warriors grace the walls, the stairs are adorned with samurai swords and bonsai trees at the sushi bar. AYCE is not offered here and I'm okay with that. I prefer quality over quantity. The rolls are handled with care and the specials are great. I enjoyed the Japanese Snapper nigiri and also had a chance to try the grilled Amber Jack collar. What a wonderful dish! My partner said the jalapeno bomb was the best he has had in the city. Not dry like others may have. Attention to detail and care for the outcome makes this number one in my book. Thank you to our great sushi chef June (sp?) who introduced us to the amber jack collar! We will be back.",

Its next to Carson Kitchen that's how I was able to fin it so quickly. Cute little spot on the corner of 6th and Carson.   When you walk in its a sushi bar which you have the choice to sit there if you'd like or there is table seating upstairs. Very clean, small but cute and intimate. It was slow when we came, but I don't mind.  We first ordered the Garlic Edamame because we heard our neighbors order it. And I must say best decision on my life. Its a bit spicy but the flavor is amazing and the garlic is not over powering. I could not stop eating them. I wish I had a bowl for myself lol. We also ordered the Jalapeno Bombs which were stuffed with Spicy Tuna and Cream Cheese. Now when I hear Jalapeno Bomb I expected really spicy, but it wasn't that spicy. But still very good. They were deep fried and the jalapenos were fresh. Must try!! Then we ordered the Baked Salmon Roll, a California Roll with baked salmon right on top; very good and tasty. Fish was not too fishy and roll was cut perfectly. We also ordered the Las Vegas Roll which was amaaazing. had eel, cream cheese, avocado and crab - deep fried!! YUM!!   We ordered the perfect amount of food, and it was not expensive at all, it came out to $35. Not too bad! And if its your first time checking in through Yelp you get a free Sake shot. Our waiter gave me a free shot too!   I'd totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi spot to go to!",

(Hint: it's right around the corner from the Commonwealth bar and there's a hotel sign right above)  From the hostess who sat us down at the sushi bar to the waitress and the busser, I'd have to say all 3 were very attentive.  Our Sushi Chef's name was John and man oh man John was definitely THE MAN of the night! We sat at the bar to watch him at his craft and it was definitely an artistry (see pics posted).  We started with the Kampachi Sashimi which I have no words for. It was simply perfect and melted right in my mouth. Next was a soft shell crab hand roll topped with salmon. The salmon was like butter as you bite into a crispy soft shell crab. We had quite a bit more after these but the rest is history as I could go on and on. My advice is you have to just go there and see for yourself because everything was great!",

My father was drinking a beer and the glass had chipped off in his mouth which cut his tongue on the inside. We asked to speak to the manager(he stated he was the co owner as well not sure if he still is the manager believe his name was carlos) he approached us extremely rude did not even care! He thought the best way to apologize would be a free beer and no sincerity at all! So we asked him to stop our order we were not going to stay there another minute especially after how rude he was. SO then He proceeded to yell across the bar and say \"don't worry you don't have to pay for anything\" in a sarcastic tone. Making it seem like we wanted free stuff all and he was trying to embarrass us all the costumers turned toward us so embarrassing all we wanted was some sincerity because a chipped glass could of really hurt someone. He probably thought we drunk and he could take advantage of that. I really could not believe it! Not cool at all I hope no one else experiences this ever",

We ordered a few rolls and they were all delicious. The fish tastes fresh and the rolls didn't fall apart.   The ambiance is nice and mellow and it's off Fremont street so it isn't crazy busy or hard to find parking.   We go to pay for our check and forgot we were there during happy hour and our waiter realized he charged us full price so he fixed it before running our card. That's awesome and shows integrity of their employees since we didn't even notice the difference before lol   Definitely coming back here, they rock.",

Not enough pork and over cooked noodles bummed me.  Overall a great meal at a fair price, would recommend!",

All sauces are basic. Service is lackluster.  The entire experience is forgettable.   My office is only a block away and this is the closest sushi restaurant in the area.

    "text": "In a nutshell: Flavorful food, great atmosphere.  Popped in for lunch at 11. You can sit immediately at the sushi bar or upstairs at a table. The menu has a variety of sushi, some bento boxes, some specials, and some appetizers. Some of the sushi has cheeky names. I ordered the Miso Hungry Ramen and my wife ordered Tuna Tare Tare. We also got a app of vegi spring rolls. The food was served in a normal amount of time and the presentation of the food was very nice! The tuna was in a nifty tower shape and had little crunchy wanton chips with it. My ramen was steaming hot and presented with a half an hard boiled egg and pork belly nicely showcased in the broth. The ramen was very flavorful and yummy. The pork belly was grilled. The noodles were plentiful and there wasn't too much of any one thing. The tuna Tare Tare was reported as being \"suuuuper good!\" The spring rolls were fried perfectly and were very tasty. The only minus to this experience was the music; if 7 is a good listening volume, the music in here was at 8, just one too loud. And newer rock music, which would be on any other day for me, super aggravating at that volume.  Real good service, really good food, great atmosphere. Loud on this day.  A hot tip for you: if you happened to park across the street, PAY ON THAT SIDE. I paid on the other side of the street closest to the restaurant and I got a ticket. Frown. ",

All of the happy hour special rolls went from $10 to $13. Now there are three rolls that are no longer available for happy hour option. The beer selection is PBR.....at a sushi restaurant? That's unfortunate that the owner can't supply Sapporo to match the menu. Granted I know the quality of seafood is top notch. Unfortunately this establishment has turn into a strip restaurant rather a downtown local spot. Guess it was good while it lasted.",

The workers do not look happy at all as they moved in the slowest pace possible.  When we were led to our table it was dirty so we asked the busboy if he can clean it but he gave us an awkward reply saying he was going to clean it but we sat already. I don't know why the host led us to that table if it wasn't even ready. No big deal anyways we were excited to try this place out!  Next thing, the restaurant wasn't even busy but it took really long for anyone to help us. Then it took about 30 minutes for us to get our sushi rolls. I felt like everyone in the restaurant got their orders before we did. I think they might have forgotten us until they realize we had nothing on our table for awhile. But anyways, ordered some of the sushi rolls and some of the fish were still thawing. Flavor wise, not too bad but nothing desirable.  If you got lots of time to kill and want to watch people eat their meal and then leave before you even get your food, then this is most definitely the spot to be. Unfortunately, the overall experience and service was why we could not appreciate what other yelpers saw.",

I like to get there around 8-8:30 before the dinner rush pours in, because it can get SO busy SO fast that it's hard for the servers to keep up, (understandably!) Really liked chef Daniel but he's no longer here :( My new favorite is V. He's the only one (so far) that makes a roll that is both delicious & absolutely beautiful at the same time. (Refer to my latest pic of the veggie roll, just perfecto). I believe he works tues & wed nights, & most afternoons, so you must stop in when he's working & have him serve you.

Usually the food I eat in Vegas is subpar...enough to almost satisfy your craving but never yummy. This place was all yummy and did not disappoint at all. Fish tasted fresh and the presentation was perfect. My only wish is that I didn't come here earlier on my holiday.",

Then moved on to the fried shrimp dumplings, then the Carson & 6th roll. And to top it off, the chef offered to make a roll based on my preferences. I said I like tuna and what I go was easily one of the better rolls I got. Regular and spicy bluefin on the inside toped with yellow tail and a spicy sauce topping. If in Downtown and you like sushi...then do yourself well, and get here",

From the exterior, it didn't look like a restaurant. But ambiance and service was good. Sushi chef was nice and friendly.  Sushi in general were good just that the size of the sushi was tiny. It's more like kid's menu. The size of the rice was quite the same as that of the fish... so I guess a bit mini...  Price was okay just that if we took into consideration the size of the sushi... I guess it's a bit overpriced.  It's not a restaurant that we will revisit when we are around next time.",

We just received our second rolls. One of us ordered miso soup and still have not gotten it. The waiter is doing both waiting on tables and helping in the bar. It was not busy when we came in and I saw people come in after us and get food before us. Our waiter kept asking us if our food had come yet but he was the one who was picking up all the orders and bringing the food to the tables.   I was told by the waiter that one of the rolls, the Poke Monster, was a large roll enough for two. It was smaller than a the rest of the rolls.   The menu is pretty limited. Not a big variety at all. Actually our soup finally arrived. It's super hot and only one piece of tofu. I will definitely not come back here.",

This place isn't big though so sometimes you have to hit the timing right to be able to eat at the bar with the sushi chef! But man they never disappoint!   So Andrew is probably one of the coolest sushi chef I have ever met! He recommend things and makes us special sushi for my husband that does not eat raw fishes! :/ see it's kinda hard when you have a picky husband that eats like a 5years old child Lol.. my husband is super picky and he doesn't even eat seaweed! And not a lot of sushi chef are not very patience when handling our orders!   Anyway; Daniel and Crystal (that's apparently leaving) are also the most down to earth people we have met down here! Bocho Sushi have created an environment where they will make sure their customers are well taken care of! And they will get to know you and sit down with you! They treat you like a family instead of just another customer customer walking in!   Now let's get to the food portion of the review; sushi are the bomb here! We order Vegas rolls I believe it's called lol. It's like an explosion in your mouth!!! And this roll does not have any rice in it! Man.. they were spicy and sweet at the same time! And all those seafood just melted in your mouth! Soo gooodd. I'm getting hungry just writing this!   And the second roll we ordered was baked salmon! That salmon though! Andrew you are the man!! Glistening pink on the inside and cooked perfectly out and super flaky! Just pretty epic I would say!   And we also ordered their fried chicken which what we always get there and baked mussels!   Well after all!!!! It's always a pleasure with this guy! Never a complaint and if I can give them 100stars I really really would!! Thank you guys so much!! Keep it up!!",

We had hot green tea, a couple of regular rolls and a couple of the special rolls- the WTF (with soft shell crab) and the Yellowtail Lover. The sushi and sashimi they were serving were beautifully prepared.  The rolls were excellent- fresh, flavorful with not a single cheap shortcut to be found in anything we ordered.  Prices were very good.  We'll make a point of returning next time we're in town.",

Chicken was deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection.  But our all time favorite was the scallop sushi, sweet with crispy onion and some sort of amazing sauce.  We loved it so much we wanted to pick up some scallop sushi on our way to the airport.  Sadly, they're closed on Sunday. Oh, did I mention very reasonably priced?!!",

We attended a company party so we had the intire upstairs to ourselves and a serving table which the kept in rotation. I have to say I do not know exactly what all I was eating and it maybe a good thing for my own mind but, I really dint find anything I did not really care for.. I did avoid the raw fish items by themselves but tried all the types of rolls and fried items they served.. wonderful flavors..  I do have to say this place is small. Seating as you come in is mostly counter and limited on space. I expected a smell to be in the air but found there was nothing to really smell.. the items where they where preparing the food all looked very fresh. Staff is very friendly and attentive. The up stairs i a small table/ bench type area with limited seating and 2 small karaoke rooms and a stand up bar. Pace is very clean and comforting. I can see myself going back..",

Good fish does not begin to make up for the worst omakase experience I have ever had. We arrived about 1 hour prior to closing and asked if they could do the $75 a head, 2 person minimum omakase. They took our order, with no indication of a problem, then proceeded to pile food in front of us as fast as they could make it. Some things were one per person, some were evidently meant to be shared. No explanation of what was being served. At one point the waitress took an untouched dish from its serving tray and put it on our side plates so that she could add another dish in front of us. Meanwhile they're sweeping up around us. 25 minutes before closing we indicated we were feeling rushed. Our server hid in a corner. The manager? apologized, but the damage was done. To be honest, the apology did not seem that genuine anyways. They took a small percentage off our bill, and I'm pretty sure we never got the full omakase (I've never had one that didn't include some kind of dessert). We certainly will not return.",

    "text": "This place is totally the spot. My friend and I probably come here once a week. I gave 3 stars because everything is a bit overpriced. And the hit and miss service. Basic rolls are 4-5$ more than average... like NOBU prices! A half dozen of oysters is like 15$ (ive literally bit into pieces of shells) and they're so tiny! Even the hot sake and asahi is expensive! The location is downtown which is awesome because there aren't that many sushi places over there!   Their baked mussels (I've eaten many shells inside the baked mussel) , rolls, rock shrimp and sake are to die for! Service is usually a hit or miss. I've literally had to go to the bar and demand service. The last 3 times I was there it was only 3 tables upstairs and they always forget everything I order! I absolutely love the second floor karaoke/bar area. The interior and layout of the place is for sure a win.",

Overall, the fish was great quality and hamachikama was massive, but the wait was just too long. Took forever for the sashimi platter to come out, and when it did we were starving so obviously it was gone in a jiffy...then another wait for the roll. We had told our waitress our order, but I dont think it was communicated to the chef, since he only started making the roll after he checked in on us while we were waiting. The chefs were fun and hard working, but I think the communication and time management is a bit lacking. Totally recommend the hamachikama, super yummy. Then the last long wait was for the check, our waitress was too busy talking story and had forgotten that we asked for our check. Overall, would not come back.",

They ordered our drinks just fine and then they took our order. 40 minutes later we are wondering where our 3 California rolls are. On top of waiting 40 minutes the guy making sushi walked back to the kitchen 4 times and every time he came back eating food with his gloves on, then he starts eating in front of us and has food all over his mouth and doesn't even notice it & continues on making our food. After all this he takes a 10 minute break standing right here drinking soda when we still don't have our rolls. The nastiest part is that HE NEVER CHANGED HIS GLOVES AFTER WALKING INTO THE KITCHEN AND EATING FREAKING FOOD AND USING THE SODA MACHINE. I'm disgusted with this",

    "text": "A hip, contemporary sushi spot was what downtown Vegas was missing, and Bocho filled that void. With competitive prices and scrumptious menu items, it gives other restaurants in the area a run for their money.   Regular lunch and dinner menus are offered, but if you want the AYCE experience, you can have that too. Both my friend and I ordered the AYCE dinner, which is 30 bucks per person. The menu is unlike the exhaustive list of specialty rolls, entrees, and appetizers found at other sushi restaurants; although, it doesn't include items offered on their regular menu.   Sitting on the second floor loft beats eating at the crowded sushi bar. I do like how the two are separated. The bar was much busier and louder as opposed to the laid-back atmosphere above. Plus, the seats are cushioned and there are pillows!  Here's what I ordered, and I'd most likely select these again.  * Calamari Skewers (yeaah, squid on a stick!) * Baked Salmon Roll * Crunch Dragon Roll * Las Vegas Roll * Unagi * Masago (no quail egg available) * Garlic tuna  * Fatty tuna  * Octopus   My favorite roll was the baked salmon with cream cheese, avocado, crab, and baked salmon on the outside. The sashimi was also delicious. I wouldn't mind returning to eat just sashimi and calamari skewers.   Our food arrived promptly, and the service was great. I'll definitely be returning.",

Place is clean and the waitress is very nice, lovely lady.   We ordered few dishes on the board, monkey brain, etc. I don't remember other names but the rolls are amazing!

I would easily pay double for this quality and service likely on the strip.  Highly encourage anyone to try it.  Easy parking available in a lot across the street.  The roll prices are very affordable and they have specials.  My wife really enjoyed their tuna with crispy rice.  We also tried the melting albacore and ate many rolls that were out of this world.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and we hope to visit it again.  They might be in the middle of the desert but the fish is as fresh as anywhere.  Give it a shot and don't forget the garlic edamame!

Cream cheese and avocado and deep fried methods are my jam. Or in this case, my roll...  Also, I will come back here time and time again for the salmon sashimi. First of all, the presentation is very refreshing. It's served on ice, with the standard ginger, wasabi, and garnishings. I love that they include an orchid flower. Definitely is a nice touch! But let me tell you, the salmon itself had me falling asleep dreaming about it all night afterwards. It's very fresh, buttery, and overall just delicious. I'd come back just for that.   Sitting at the bar is fun too! The guys working back there are pretty fun to talk to and interact with.  I only knocked it down one star because parking is a hassle, but with downtown that's expected. Hey, at least you can walk off all that sashimi afterwards!",

If you're trying to come here during the 11-3 lunch hour and don't want sushi I say get the lunch box/ lunch ramen choices for $11, drink included! More bang for your buck. If, in fact, you have chosen to take a later lunch or head over for happy hour I believe they have sushi 20% off from 3-6, which is great. The sushi is always fresh and the waiters are super nice. I even heard that there's a spot upstairs for karaoke.   Definitely worth the trek to downtown Fremont.",

The parking wasn't ideal because you have to pay for metered parking in the lot next door. There was a lot of street construction nearby, I don't know if it's normally like that. Also, there were homeless people sleeping in the parking area. I would have felt a bit unsafe being there alone but luckily my boyfriend is awesome and waited for me outside. If they have free parking I would definitely go back here soon!",

You go exploring, you go yelping, and you settle on a restaurant that's not too far away! I came across Bocho Sushi during a yelp search and found out that they had lunch specials! Perfect!   I ended up sitting at the bar when I got there because it was just wee lil ol me. Why take up a table? I'm not sure if it's standard procedure since I wasn't ordering sushi but no one stopped me or said no! So off I roll ...  I decided to get their chicken bento box, which came with chicken, rice, mixed tempura, salad, AND a fountain drink for $11.00. Honestly, the price is amazing especially since it comes with a drink. It is also a good portion of food for me. If you tend to have bigger meals, it may not be enough food.   Their chicken was very tender. It wasn't a huge piece -- pretty thin but I don't think it was breast meat. They do drizzle some teriyaki sauce on top! But I think I preferred it without the sauce hahaha! The tempura was decent. I did not eat too much of the salad because their dressing was a ginger based dressing and I'm not a fan of ginger. The only thing is that the rice was a bit dried out? It almost seems it's kind of old. Overall, it's pretty decent. I've had a better bento box elsewhere but for the price and location, definitely worth it!   I didn't try any of their sushi so I can't really comment on that but my friend loves this place :)  Their service is pretty good! Very accommodating and very nice! They're all pretty friendly and funny too. Definitely a nice place to hang out with friends or just chat with the sushi chef.",

The person who took our order over the phone was positive, professional and engaging.    We asked for the order to be extra spicy and the chef added fresh jalapeno's and a spicy sauce on the side.

Must order.  *Ryan special roll- So tasty that we ordered a second roll.  Service was great from beginning to end. Totally recommend this restaurant if you're close to Fremont Street!",

We sat at the sushi bar, and waited 30 minutes for 3 slices of salmon sashimi, and got 2 pieces of salmon sushi instead :/ which I ate, and then ordered salmon sashimi asian, which came another 15 minutes later haha....the china roll was good. It kept taking 15-20 minutes to get more beer, which we had to keep ordering from different people....which resulted in us getting charged for a couple more beers then we ordered and consumed :( that I gladly paid because I was just in a hurry at that point, and the server didn't understand what we were trying to communicate. Anyways I'll go back in a couple weeks and try again! The food was good and it had great ambience. Just need to get organized and work on guest service a little bit",

Wish it was in a better location, only for their sake, I would hate for them not to get business and would be nice if there was outside seating and some sort of view, but it's off major sidewalks/corners, off Fremont.)  but otherwise - on the money!  Super fresh.  We tried several rolls off the menu and I can't say one was better than the other - all were so tasty.  Great service.  We sat upstairs.  (more roomier-downstairs is sushi bar only)  Got the Sake/Cucumber - something or other martini ;) - it was awesome.  I think the prices were good - not strip prices, but not local.  They should offer a small - all you can eat sushi menu - (just an idea).  Drinks are high end.  Sushi is fresh and presentation is high end.  Super clean, modern.  You are only walking distance from Container Park and Fremont.  There is public parking ($2.00 per hour or $1.00 per hour) close by.  We love Downtown and hope it stays trendy and upcoming.  If we are craving high end sushi - we will come back here, for sure.",

The food was so dynamite that I brought my boyfriend back this past Thursday for lunch.  We had a salmon roll, Vegas roll (with tuna substituted for eel), some tuna sushi, an albacore special roll (from their specials board), California roll and a fried chicken appetizer.  The servers were wonderful, and didn't mind me ordering extra sauce with everything or being \"that girl\" who makes substitutions in rolls (stop judging me - lol).  That said, every roll was great-- the tuna wasn't mealy or super muscular and chewy-- it was perfect. Also, the fried chicken sounds like a weird thing to order at a sushi restaurant, but it's a MUST-try! Soooo good!!   Will definitely be coming back here!",

I kept it light with two rolls, and called it a day. Fish was fresh, rolls were made well and not super rice heavy. Service was average, with nothing memorable about the experience.   The second time i came for their Happy Hour, i ordered similar with the two rolls and an order of nigiri and the rice was a tad on the dry/hard side. I don't want to be too picky but at the same time if you expect me to return then please keep it consistent. I returned because the food was on point the first time.   The dining area was clean, and the bathrooms were pleasantly maintained as well. Id return when i am in the area but i will not go out of my way. I could spend a little bit more than my two rolls during happy hour and get better quality AYCE elsewhere.",

I ended up ordering the miso soup, garlic edamame, yellowtail lover roll, and the number 5 roll. It was pretty standard. Nothing bad but nothing to write home about either. We also ordered 2 mango sake's. It was served in one of those cooling glass jugs but they forgot to fill the center with ice.

    "text": "I had high hopes for Bocho- downtown LV has long lacked a decent sushi joint. Unfortunately, this spot still doesn't quite hit the spot. Fish is fresh, but AYCE is the only reasonable way to go here. Lunch specials are pricey and don't highlight the fish items on the menu.  On two separate lunch visits, I opted for the Shunta Box- Bocho's take on a bento box, with a (heated) fish dish, 4 piece California roll, mixed tempura, white rice, and miso soup. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the small assortment of pickles included as an accent, but even the half-roll I had was falling apart. I'm not the hugest fan of heated salmon, but two visits in a row they have been out of the black cod- other reviews mention this, too. Maybe remove it from the menu and feature it as a special if it's not consistently available, or stock more if you legitimately run out all the time. It was a filling lunch, but there are many places in town to get the same thing, and it won't run me $20 with tip.  Service was fine. I sat at the sushi bar and placed my order directly with the chef, hostess came around frequently to give drink refills. It's nice to have this spot in the downtown area, but they need to kick it up a notch- the special rolls sounded pretty standard and the bartender told another customer the carpaccio-type dishes did not qualify for AYCE pricing? Too many better places in town to come back here specifically.",

After some time, my friend wanted to go order food to go, so she went and we met up with her.   This place is not that big, but not small. Has 2 floor with karaoke rooms on the second floor. Pretty cool setup.   When we met up with her, she asked if she could have it there and they had no problem and took us to a seat. Even though she placed her order already, the lady asked if we needed anything. We waited, but not long and the food came out. I wasn't hungry, but food and I have this sort of relationship where if it's placed in front of me, and offered, I will eat it. So I caved. But let me tell you it was well worth it! I don't even remember what my friend ordered, but it was so good. I just kept eating the rolls haha! I believe there were 3 different rolls and they each were so tasty and so fresh. Also, when you check in you get a free shot of sake. I personally don't like sake because it taste like I'm drinking nail polish remover. So I can't tell you if it's hot or cold. But if that's your thing, have at it.   I definitely would like to come back here and try other rolls they have on the menu. Maybe even hop up and sing some karaoke. Mmm no maybe not the singing part.",

They're located downtown near Freemont and it's a really cozy little space. We sat at the bar and ordered straight from the sushi chef. He was super chill- I wish I got his name for you guys!   I don't like mayos on my rolls and he caught on after I asked him about a few different ones. Finally, he just offered to make me whatever roll I wanted minus the mayo.  The sushi was delicious. Brief descriptions of what I got:   1 California roll with imitation crab (since I didn't want the mayo mixed.)  1 Tiger Roll (shrimp tempura inside)  1 Spider Crab Roll (deep fried soft shell crab inside)   Definitely the best I've had in town. We'll be back without a doubt. If you haven't been, you'll want to check this spot out for your next sushi outing.",

The only issue I had was with the overall outside and decor.  First our cab couldn't find the place (close, but amazingly not easy to spot).  Also, the inside was pretty nondescript.

For $15, you can get salmon, saba or black cod. Comes with California roll or spicy tuna roll, miso soup, sunomono salad, rice, tempura and a drink. The black cod was great. 4/5  Sashimi Salad Bowl: Diced fish including salmon, tuna, whitefish, and hamachi. Includes miso soup and a drink.

This place is for people who don't know sushi. Sadly it was the only place we could find downtown and the reviews were misleading. If you have never had sushi before and all you eat are rolls covered in mayo and sauce then this may be your place.  If you seek out sashimi or nigiri then you best move on. We tried 8 different pieces and to cap off the lousiness of the preparation we were served the most rubbery Ebi I have had outside of a vending machine in Japan. WAIT. That Ebi was much better.  I still can't get over the response to the sashimi question. No adjustment or replacement. Just a promise for a visit that will never happen. I hope enough people read this review to put them off this experiment.  It was the equivalent of sushi Panda Express. Spend your money on slots and a hot dog instead.",

Lots of choices to try at a great price. The rolls were delicious and finely crafted and we even had fresh oysters. They were as fresh as if you got em off the coast.   In addition to the great food, the whole staff was really cool. We were treated like old friends and the whole staff was very engaging. It totally capped off a great vacation in Vegas. Looking forward to visiting Vegas and Bocho soon.",

    "text": "If you're in with the Downtown crowd you've probably heard there's FINALLY a sushi spot open. I work close to Downtown, so any new restaurant is a blessing for me, for after-dinner bites, and for lunchtime.  Bocho Sushi inhabits a little corner on Carson Street next to O Face Donuts and Carson Kitchen. The inside, while cramped when you first walk in as you are greeted directly by the bar is stylish and modern with contrasting light wooded walls and floors and dark chairs. Head upstairs for a better vibe. Tables are low, accompanied with pillows, a small bar in the back, and the Mad Men theme song playing over the speakers (seriously, I think I heard it around 4 times while we dined).  My friend and I embarked upon their AYCE dinner menu for $30. While their menu is not as extensive as many sushi spots in Vegas, I didn't have an issue selecting many items to suit my preference.   We had the following: Spicy Tuna Hand Roll Jalapeno Bombs Mushroom Yaki Calamari Skewers Seaweed Salad Super White Tuna Shrimp Octopus Oysters on the half shell Green tea mochi ice cream  Rolls Salmon Skin Roll Las Vegas Roll  I may be missing a roll in there somewhere.  Overall the sashimi and regular rolls were great and fresh, served quickly with not too much wait time between ordering and finishing other rolls on our table.  The Las Vegas Roll was way too filling. I wouldn't suggest it while eating AYCE as it will fill you up since it has both cream cheese AND it is deep fried. It was just a little overpowering for me, so I wouldn't get this one again.  I did enjoy the spicy tuna hand roll, the super white tuna, and the jalapeno bombs - very spicy, definitely try those.   Service was great, our Green tea and waters were kept filled. I wouldn't say this is and AMAZING place to get sushi, but if you're in the area it totally fills the spot for sushi in a good way. I will be back.",

I really enjoyed the rock and roll, however, there was seaweed inside the cucumber which is unusual.  The Philadelphia roll had salmon on the outside, cream cheese and avocado inside. It tasted okay, however the slices of salmon were extremely thin. When fish is on the outside and the roll costs more because of this I would expect thicker slices.  The jalapeno bombs were yummy, though some were much hotter than others.  The rainbow roll was good.  The seaweed salad was good. It was a good size. There was lettuce under it, and a tomato and an orange slice on top.   The sake was warm. I prefer it hot as it cools down quickly.",

I don't say this on a trivial whim, I say this because from waitstaff to the sushi chefs everything was great. However, if your dead set against leaving the strip then you are sure to miss this gem. If your staying on Freemont street, it's just a short three block walk. Fish is extremely fresh and tasty. Sushi chefs willing to suggest and let you try new things out of your comfort zone. If you need your sushi fix and staying in Vegas, don't hesitate to come visit these guys.  As a side note, they have an \"All You Can Eat\" special for 30 bones that is a crazy value for sushi lovers, but if AYCE is not your style then there is the Happy Hour 30% off deal that is sure to please.",

    "text": "I'm always downtown and for quite some time, a good majority of regular patrons have been wanting a sushi spot to finally venture. Sad to say, Bocho did not leave a good impression.  I had been looking forward to trying this ever since rumors began to surface of a sushi restaurant opening downtown. I've heard of mixed reviews from friends since it's opening so rather than take others words for it, finally decided to check it out.   The sushi bar downstairs if basic and reminds me of something you may find in Los Angeles or New York where space is at premium. It is very well lit as you walk in and are greated by the chefs. There is also an upstairs dining area that is a bit more spacious and can accommodate larger groups and there is also a private room available, the cocktail bar is also located upstairs.   As we sat down, our server greeted us quickly and asked if we'd like drinks. Water and a beer were ordered and brought to the table promptly followed by complimentary edamame. Quite a few things were ordered off the menu and I can say that the fish was very fresh, the flavors of the sauces and condiments used for rolls were very tasty, no complaints there. The one major thing I had an issue with and anyone who loves sushi should have an issue with is hard, dense, undercooked rice. I mean, you're a sushi restaurant and you use rice all day long. How could your one major ingredient be under par, especially since it is the base for all of your dishes. Again, the fish was fresh and delicious but you can't have a good sushi restaurant if you can't produce good rice!   Our bill was split in 3 which our server did not mind doing so but she was not very attentive when it came to keeping my water glass full and checking to make sure things were going okay. 3 people ordered separate orders and some of them were mixed together (sushi). When we asked our server to clarify what was what, she got very flustered and said she did not know how to differentiate the rolls. Also, the table next to us had a big group and they asked our server to take a picture of them which of course would've not bothered me if she had not practically climbed on our table to take a picture of them, not even excusing herself as we were still finishing up our meal, very unprofessional.   So overall, will I go back??? Maybe, possibly. If they can cook their rice properly.",

Everything was great and we were happy to see a great sushi place now available downtown.   When we thought we were done some gifts from the kitchen came out like grilled king oyster mushrooms and tuna tostada. A great way to finish our meal and a nice way to make us feel special on our first visit.   Heads up. Jimmy the chef likes to drink.

But all the sushi was so fresh and tasty. Also had some of their fried chicken, which was very good but so heavy compared to the sushi.  The ambiance is very laid back. Reasonably priced.

The food runner/ service assistant set us up a table and the seemingly overwhelmed waitress came to take our order.  After ordering our sushi the rolls took 15 minutes to come. The drinks took 10. Our server explained that the bartender was very busy and we then realized that there was only one bartender for the entire restaurant.  When our food came we found the fish fishy. The imitation crab in the rainbow roll was blergh and the shrimp was so dry it was almost crunchy (it wasn't tempura).  We got two rolls, one sashimi, and one sushi. For the sushi the rice fell off of the fish as soon as we tried to pick it up (sign of bad sushi making). When we walked past the sushi bar it smelt fishy. The bocho martini was bitter and tasted like straight up cucumber peel. I sent it back.  The John E. Carson roll and the Garlic Tuna sashimi were tasty. However, we spent $5 less than we would have at our favorite AYCE place (Sakana) and Sakana has better quality fish and better service.  I would have rather eaten at Sakana and been full when I left. Not going to Bocho again.",

Their ramen is a hefty portion and has a good amount of toppings, along with their high quality ingredients they use to make their rolls, it's a winner for anyone looking for exceptional Japanese food in the area.

Had crispy rice with tuna, miso, and edamame. Nothing was much good. The crispy rice was a special and I was expecting a bowl, so the dish was a surprise. A small description would be helpful. Edamame tasted like it wasn't fresh and the garlic sauce they were drenched in lacked a decent flavor. The most disappointing part was the miso soup. This tasted like it came straight from a packet and it lacked actual miso flavor. Don't have any intention to return, but I will say the prices weren't atrocious. I wish downtown businesses would work on feeling more friendly and happy to have the business of patrons.",

    "text": "Considering Bocho is owned by the same group that runs Le Thai and Le Pho, two of my favorite restaurants, I could not be more disappointed with my experience.  I should start by saying I know you don't go to a sushi restaurant if you don't like sushi. I get it. But my husband does like sushi and he finished a big project at work this week so I wanted to celebrate. I looked at the menu thoroughly online so I knew what my options were.  First, we kind of had the same issue other people did in choosing a table to sit at. I have short legs and lower back issues so bar seating doesn't work too well for me. A table was offered to us and yet it felt like we were being punished for choosing it at the same time. More on that in a minute.  Let me say our server and most of the staff were great. Plates were cleared, drinks refilled and so on. Our server also works at Le Pho (I knew I recognized her!) and was really nice. Oh, and the iced tea was good.  That's the good part. We ordered some appetizers, the beef gyoza and shishito peppers. Gyoza dumplings are supposed to be steamed and lightly pan fried but these were so greasy. SO. GREASY. And inside the third one there was a crunchy texture that should definitely not have been there so I stopped eating them. The shishito peppers were tasty.  For my dinner, I ordered Karage Chicken which, according to Google, should be marinated, then coated in potato starch and flash fried so they come out crisp and juicy. Sounds delicious, right? Oh no, my dudes. What I got was a plate of freezer burned looking (I wish I had taken a picture but I was so hungry by this point I didn't even care) and unfortunately very dry chicken with an odd choice of spicy mayo as a side. The chicken skewers weren't any better. SO. DRY. They came out a good ten minutes after my husband's sushi rolls did so maybe they were left under the heat lamp? Or maybe we were being punished for interrupting the employee's party of three going on upstairs?  Thought I forgot about that, didn't you? Nah. While we were getting and attempting to enjoy this disaster of a meal (husband's sushi was also not great, I should mention, since it IS a sushi restaurant), an employee, presumably off duty but still in uniform, brings two of his... sisters? Lady friends? And sat down at a table with a full bottle of rum. One of the girls, using a small bullhorn, screeches something about a birthday and the curse words didn't stop after that. I'm no prude. I really don't care if people curse. I DO care about how businesses present themselves and how their employees represent the businesses they work for. Particularly when it is disruptive and rude.  So, I ask: was our food purposely bad because we were encroaching on this employee's party? If so, our bad. The hostess could have told us the upstairs was unavailable (I had never been there, I didn't even know it existed) and I would have suffered through bar seating if it had meant I could have had a decent meal and I didn't feel like I wasted my money and was disappointed we \"celebrated\" my husband's accomplishment in absolutely the wrong place. 24 hours later and I'm still mad about it.  For what it's worth, I did take the leftovers home for our daughter, who eats damn near anything. But not this. So there you go. We'll stick with the AYCE options in town.",

    "text": "Wow well WHY am I NOT surprised at the interaction I just had with a woman named Mercy who claimed she is the new manager at Bocho. My husband & I frequent this restaurant at least 6 times a year since it opened. We had a not so great experience in March for my birthday as well as the time before. I gave an honest review & even gave 3 stars although it was more a 2 star experience. Carlos the then manager emailed me & wanted to make it right telling me that the next time we came in he would like to take care of our meal. We also ate here again in June as a last minute decision & I was told Carlos was not there. It was a less than stellar experience yet again with poor service, food VERY different than the last time even though it was the same dish etc... VERY inconsistent and some people who work there not so nice. So we are going to Vegas again this weekend so I called and asked for Carlos. He NO longer works there and this woman Mercy told me she will NOT honor what Carlos told me and will not do ANYTHING except make sure our experience is okay!! Guess what!! Why does she have to make sure of that? Shouldn't that be automatic when running a restaurant. Poorly run restaurant & I question the freshness of the food as well as the practices here.I told her she has lost us as customers & guess what she didn't even blink an eye! BYE Bocho and I will make sure I no longer recommend you either which I have done repeatedly in the past. YOUR loss. And FYI judging from the reviews I'm not the only one that has had problems . They need to get a clue. BTW...I love how they now have Andrew's name in correspondence from Carlos. Yeah....Okay",

Sushi combo, to me, gives most \"bang for your buck\". 7 nigiri with futomaki or cali roll.  Their rice to fish ratio in nigiri is something that should be noted. Small rice to big fish. Just the way I like it!!  Their chirashi was very nice, very beautifully done. But, with this one, they give you almost 2 servings of rice   Recommend this place for girls night, date night, and lunch. Not sure how kids-friendly this place could be as I've never taken my child here, but from the look of the establishment and clientele, I'm assuming not?",

The staff was very friendly and the place appeared to be very clean.  The sushi was outstanding. Very fresh. The poke was excellent, as well as the Yellowtail with jalapenos. Everything was wonderful. Well deserving of five stars.  I would definitely recommend dining here. I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "I stayed downtown for three nights, and two of my dinners were l here. That tells you something.   They have an all-you-can-eat offering on Tuesday nights after 6 p.m. It's $28.95 for 1 hour where you can order off a special AYCE menu that doesn't include everything on the standard one, but has some things that aren't on the regular menu. Sadly, the photo I took of the AYCE menu came out blurry, and I was going to rely on it to list everything that I tried and liked. I'll save that for the update since I am going again next week.  I sat at the bar where Brian and Carlos prepared all of my dishes. Brian was particularly nice in putting up with my lame non foodie conversation even though he was clearly very busy. If he's around, I recommend sitting in front of him.  The food was great. It's definitely up there in the top 2 sushi places I have ever been to, and the other place is no longer in business. Particularly memorable was the maguro nigiri, which really tasted fresh and very tuna-like, in a good way. The ebi nigiri also tasted different from every other place I have been too I guess because it was so fresh. The texture was the difference. Each of the rolls were massive. The only item that didn't do it for me was a roll that had deep fried batter, which seemed a little heavy for me. Everyone around me was having the Poke monster, so I tried it during happy hour two nights later. Incredible, and really satisfying.   My two hosts were Marcy and Ryan, and they are to be commended for their cheerfulness and service.  I'm going make this a regular stop when I'm downtown. See you next week!",

I did not see the upstairs but there is additional seating.   The chairs at the bar are awkward and really squeaky. It was odd and a little embarrassing trying to get in and out of them because they were so noisy.  The food was absolutely worth the weird chairs.   We ordered several items including the garlic tuna and three rolls. Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. The service was friendly and the sushi chefs were a great time.  The restaurant is on the southwest corner of 6th and Carson. The signage is minimal so it's easy to miss it.   I can not wait to return.",

    "text": "The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson. Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai), backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant). The Chun's are at the helm, they are no strangers to day-to-day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades. At two weeks new, Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting.   Our friends invited us to dinner, upon our arrival, every seat in the house was taken. Downstairs you'll find the sushi bar with counter seating, and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar. The space has an industrial feel, but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed. The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch. This block was once forgotten, but now? It's alive and well.   The menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs. Plus, there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience. Sake, beer and cocktails are free flowing. They have not yet begun serving wine, however. We started with orders of Edamame ($3.50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5.95). The bomb was \"bomb\" (har), seriously, though, it was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese. Unfortunately, the Edamame was late to show. It served as dessert.   A smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed: Yellowtail Lover ($9.95), Tiger Roll ($11.95), China Roll ($11.95), Spider Crab Roll ($12.95), Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11.99), Salmon Sashimi ($6.25). The were all well executed. The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh. My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu, and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. Both selections were bursting with flavor.   The staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive, the only flaw seems to be with timing. I'm confident that they will get that resolved in time. It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm. Bocho is currently open for dinner, but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week.",

Late weekday night so pretty empty which is a good thing.  $27 all you can eat sushi and $15 all you can drink Sake, which is a better thing.  Unfortunately service marred the overall experience.  Looks like late night weekday is staffed by a bunch of 20-somethings -- whom I have absolutely no prejudice against.  But overall not the warm, attentive service I'm used to getting at well rated sushi bars.  I don't like it when you are supposed to order from the waiter as opposed to directly from the sushi chef.  We did the all you can eat and drink and we were starving and I'm 99% sure we were intentionally neglected.  Very \"cold\" service - not rude but just mediocre at best.  Sushi quality is actually average for semi-upscale sushi joint.  I would go back but probably not sit at the Sushi bar and hope for better service.  It's a 3.5 that night but seeing overall this place is a bit overrated, I'm rounding down instead of up to try to help \"correct\" the average.  Always happy to give 4 and 5 stars, pretty easily actually but honestly the place fell short of that this time.",

Strange considering it is Friday, downtown. Wanted to order Spanish mackerel sashimi at first, but was told that they were out. They were also out of something else (forgot what ingredient specifically in a specialty roll now), so we changed our order for the rolls. Ended up with ootoro and amberjack sashimi, no. 5 (at the recommendation of the waitress who said it was the most popular), pink lady and dragon crunch. Though no 5 was the recommended roll, the most interesting and delicious one ended up to be the pink lady. Service was attentive, it not a bit excessive, with the waitress coming up more than several times just to see if everything was okay, cutting off the middle of a sentence in our conversation.",

    "text": "If you're a sushi lover - This a is a refreshing new place you may want to visit while in the new revitalized community of downtown Fremont east.  We had made a reservation prior which I would strongly recommend if your planning a gathering of 4 or more.  As you walk in, the staff immediately welcomes you in Japanese and you get a sense of warmth with all the smiles from the chefs and staff.  My group were led upstairs to a very Art Deco asian inspired loft with a bar and the first thing I noticed was the place setting giving the atmosphere a polished dining experience.  The wait staff were friendly and efficient, shout out to Taylor, our waiter, he did a wonderful job of anticipating our needs.  After drinks and starters, our meal arrived in a timely manner, there were some unexpected downfalls, not from the waiter but from the arrival of some of the dishes.  The beef Gyoza arrived but they seemed to be a little cold, one person in my party had some bones in her salmon, but we were more concerned for other patrons that we let him know so no one else would encounter what one of my dining members encountered.  A slight mix up of yellow tail sushi - but quickly recovered, we still, overall enjoyed ourselves.  The prices are typical of what you would expect of a sushi place and the presentation of all the food we ordered, was visually appealing and tasty.  I discovered they have a couple of private rooms that could host a nice group guests for a more seclusive and intimate experience. I also learned that there will Karaoke available for those rooms for a little entertainment.  The background music was fun and enjoyable and wasn't intolerable.  This is definitely a nice place to enjoy great Japanese cuisine before hitting the rest of downtown Fremont, I would suggest that if you love sushi, definitely hit this place up. At the bar, you can sit if you're flying solo or if your a couple.  The experience overall is comforting and enjoyable, besides the couple of minor incidences, I think the rating I gave is fair.  I will definitely recommend rhis place to others.  :)",

Our sushi chefs, Daniel and TJ, answered questions we had, offered suggestions, and made delicious sushi. The drinks are absolutely amazing. The Soju comes in 4 different flavors and it gives an amazing buzz. It is affordable and tasty!! Overall, Bocho is priced affordably and has amazing service. It is a must visit restaurant that is a few blocks off of Fremont Street.",

After being ignored for a good 10 minutes finally got a waiter's attention. Think it might have been his first day. Asked what the HH specials were and someone at the bar area said it was 30% off bill not including AYCE. Fine. Only wanted apps anyway. Waiter comes back and we order shishito peppers ($4.50), baked green lip mussels ($6.95) and spicy tuna roll ($5.95) plus large hot sake.  You only receive FOUR peppers though they are large. Taste was fine. Mussels were kind of strange. I thought tasted OK, DH did not. Roll was very mushy and not spicy at all. Sake was fine.  OK, back to getting the bill. Waiter obviously saw we were ordering off app menu and we confirmed with him about the 30% discount. So he drops bill at the table and charges us for 2 AYCE dinners! WTF. We were the ONLY diners upstairs so he couldn't get us mixed up with someone else. This guy was extremely polite but totally clueless. Won't be back. Nothing impressed at all.",

It had glowing reviews and good pictures and we decided to pull the trigger. I was a little weary of sushi in Vegas but boy was this some of the best sushi I ever had! We sat at the bar and our chef Joon, prepared us some sushi rolls I had never tried before. He's an amazing chef and even better person. Get the Something Gone Roll and let him or any of the other chefs prepare you something of their choosing - you can give input of course but in these scenarios just trust these creative sushi minds!   Awesome sushi, great ambiance and sake shots on the house for the entire bar when they close at 11pm!!! Check out the video we posted of it in slomo!

Yes the new sushi place is located at the old historic hotel joining other not to miss places in the same building like Carson kitchen and O-face doughnuts.  Nothing made more noise than Bocho's opening in downtown since Godzilla as it was one of the most anticipated new restaurant openings in downtown. Bocho (Japanese for knife) will slice you some of the freshest, tastiest and perfectly uncooked pieces of fish you could find in the Las Vegas desert. I've been here a couple times and both times the service was genuine and outstanding.   The space is very limited so every square foot was meticulosly planed and decorated for maximum functionality but they also have more space upstairs for larger groups or private parties.... So now you know, if you're looking for fresh, juicy and satisfying.....go downtown!",
