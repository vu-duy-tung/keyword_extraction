    "text": "Never been more scared in my life thinking about food! Circus Circus not exactly world renowned for the food. In all honesty the hotel is SOO out of date just like all the restaurants and really every aspect of the property. Expectations not much. I came here out of convenience. My niece had her birthday party at the adventure dome with friends. Instead of driving around after hours of fun just decided easier eat at the hotel. It was the first time been to the Circus Buffet. Trust me outside of the fact the price is cheap no reason would come back to this buffet.   The selection not much to choose from the buffet. It is small buffet compare to the current buffets. The hot section theme like the norm with italian section of pastas (nothing wow cheese raviolis with tomato sauce, couple other basic pasta dishes), mexican section (build your own tacos, meat done you just put your favorite toppings on your way), and american fare food. They have build your own pasta station. The kids enjoy that seeing cook do little show in front of you. The selection straight forward plan choice of three sauces white, tomato, or pesto and the pasta spaghetti, penne, and one more forget. The thing is all of the sauces and pasta pre made just gets reheated for show. The craving station was the best part of the buffet for me. The turkey or steamship round of beef. The guy working the craving station had great personality and friendly. The dessert section talk about blah. It was so outdated kind of sad. Most part all of the desserts were on plates. No really glass display with wider variety of desserts. Nothing fancy just your slices of pies, cakes, cookies, and self service yogurt machine for cones. I found positive/negative is drinks they have couple fountain drink stations just need get it yourself. Rare since most places you get it from your server.   Overall I really thought it was going to be an one star experience not that two is something too hype about. The food was nothing good just very plain, vanilla, and selection was horrible. Not one of the better buffet in town.",

We came with a large group and stayed at Circus Circus so we thought the next morning we would try out their breakfast buffet, and let me tell you WHAT A MISTAKE! The food was horrible!  I think the best thing I consumed was the Sierra Mist, the omelet, and the granola.  The waffles tasted like frozen sawdust, the fruit was not sweet, they use off-brand cereals that look like they have sat there for years. The french toast was terrible.  I cannot say much good about this place.  It was dingy and seemed very old fashioned (in my opinion).  However,  one pleasant thing also was our waitress.  She was so friendly and helpful, and she never lost the smile from her face.    For $13 you paid there (I believe it was) you can take that money and eat at the Stratosphere for a little more and have a much more pleasant dining experience.",

We tried a little bit of everything and can't say a bad thing about the place.   The made to order pasta was to die for & super fresh !! My favorite thing by far!!!  There was no seafood and it wasn't as good as some of the more expensive buffets but its definitely worth the $18 bucks !!!   go check it out !!!",

It wasn't just the pasta station but from all the food selections there was nothing special about any of it.   The only thing this has going for it is the amount of food this buffet has, the food quality is not worth coming back to though.

We ate here the night after a rather disappointing dinner at the Garden Grill. The buffet was actually an improvement.    If you are staying in the hotel,  too tired after a long day of walking and if there isn't a long line it's ok.  It wouldn't be that great if you had to wait in line.

    "text": "Even after seeing all the negative reviews of this place, Me and my girl went here for lunch, I tried to stay a little optimistic about going here, only reason being I had a pass for (2) free buffets, so I didnt spend a dime on the meal,  the tip only!  The only semi highlight of this place was the beverage stations, which had juices, milk, chocolate milk, skim, sodas, coffee, tea etc. and the dessert station which had more to choose from than a Hometown Buffet.  At the carving station (which I hoped to be some type of meat) of the buffet they featured cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and veggie pizza as well as potato chips (sarcasm but truth) . Everything here tasted not very good, but it was free for us so I could not complain too much lol.  Will never go here again unless its free, even then will think about it..  Server was good though, but review was based solely on food experience, not recommended at all.  Price for lunch would have been $13.99 each.  Total rip off, better off going to Mcdonalds up stairs lol.",

This place needs smart bombing with disinfectant, it looks grubby and it is grubby.  Not a taste of class anywhere, all given over to the cheapest of tourists,down and outs and extended eastern families.

The steakhouse restaurant has been voted the best in Las Vegas about 15 times. I have eaten there and the Sunday brunch is amazing. Breakfast buffet is good and the casino cafe is good for a late night snack.   The rooms are currently being refurbished so it can only get better in my books.",

There are hardly any choices to choose from!!! Sorry but need to add more choices. What you guys have is ok not to bad but was not satisfied.

    "text": "We just landed in town from Massachusetts and since we were staying here we'd thought it was a good idea to checkout their Buffet, Where do i begin; for (4) people the total comes to $86 + tip which i it is much more than other buffets within the area we've tried previously. Upon checking out their selection i was extremely dissapointed everything looked like it had been sitting out there all day, Their fried chicken was actually worst than Banquet boxed microwaveable chicken; the Enchiladas were horrible and tasted nothing like an enchilada, pineapple BBQ chicken was tough and overcooked, the egg rolls had an frozen/microwaved taste to them and the desserts pies/cakes etc. tasted stale.   What really bothered and infuriated me about todays visit is that the food attendant on the other-side of the buffet bar is wiping/cleaning the spilled food around the corners of the pan, She must've thought no one was there or watching and i seen as the dirty dish rag she was wiping counters with fell right into the mash-potatoes along with the nasty bits she had picked up with the rag. Upon seeing this i just froze, me and her locked eyes and was speechless as she just continued to wipe away like nothing had ever happened - DISGUSTING and unacceptable. I bailed losing $86 needless to say i will NEVER again be visiting Circus Buffet, I will be requesting an refund and if i don't get it i'll be forced to contact my credit card provider.  Something else i should point out, During the few minutes i spent here i watched 2 couples and a family of 3 people come-in, look at the food and leave. For this being Vegas and being a tourism based city, to have things like these happen in full spectrum - its disappointing to say the least. Lastly id like to make note that the picture i've added is of the lady who dropped the rag in the mash potatoes, Hopefully someone should bring to her attention that doing that is certainly a great way to get someone with a food allergy etc. sick - I truly wish i could give this place NO STARS.",

The place gets 3 stars for the good service as they cleared the plates and were pretty attentive to our requests for napkins and such.  But foodwise..., I think there are ALOT of better places to go around Vegas.  We went here out of convenience as we were already at Midway playing the carnie games.  The fried chicken was dry (after they had just put more chicken).  Pasta seemed old too... but they had just brought out a new batch.   They're desert isn't too bad... I kind of liked it.  Also, I like how they arrange access to soda dispensers so easily.. so that's a plus.  Would I go again?  Maybe not.. unless I'm stuck at Circus Circus.",

I was not really looking forward to it, because I had heard bad things about it before.  The variety of food available was horrible, and it tasted even worse!  I had some turkey and stuffing, but the turkey was paper dry and the stuffing was mush.  It seemed to be about as wet as a good bowl of porridge.  Oh, and it was about as bland as could be.  As other reviewers have mentioned, much of the other food had the consistency of cardboard and seemed as though it had just been microwaved.  Even the food in the \"kids\" section was gross, but at least they had (cardboard) pizza.  The salads seemed okay, but I cannot eat that much salad!  I guess the best part was the dessert, but even that was weak in comparison to many other buffets I've been to before.  Even if you have kids, I would strongly recommend going somewhere else.  The only reason these guys are still in business is because of the cheap prices ($15 for dinner).  People need to start taking their families elsewhere in order for the message to get through to management.  Even then I doubt it would be improved much.  Most other buffets have something for everyone, including kids.  But I don't get letting your kids have crap such as mac and cheese when there are far better options available.",

All the food we got was fresh and tasted great.  We got from different salads to fresh clams... Yum! To ham, beef, turkey, tasty ribs and so much more.  I am a very picky eater and I will complain and judge a lot.  I guess when te other people that reviewed this location went by they had a bad experience but as far as I'm concerned, we ate a lot including a great selection of desserts.   I guess $16 bux a person its a little high considering u can probably get so much more and better from around all the other major casinos.   I'm trying a good seafood buffet next time.

I get that every buffett restaurant won't have high quality food, but you'd expect things to at least be edible.  At any buffett place, the first thing you'd try is fried chicken, because it's probably the safest thing to eat, right?  Wrong.  Circus Circus fried chicken is as dry as my grandpa's elbow, and it's as tough as biting a crocodile--not that I've done that before.  I don't even need to talk about how bland it was.  I've said it in other reviews, but I spent more time filling myself with fluids than eating actual food.  The best food this place served was waffles, and come on--that's a breakfast item.  Of course, it's Circus Circus.  I'm just surprised this place hasn't closed down yet.  This was the spot in the 80's, but that was like 20 years ago.",

There was no variety and it really lacked choices. 15 minutes after getting there they began to switch to the lunch foods.

We ate there for two (or three...) days and we enjoyed our meals.  Can't go wrong with breakfast, but it is no longer a bargain to eat there for dinner, although it is a lot cheaper than other hotels.  Staff was friendly and they engaged us.  The dishes on the hot-line tend to be...how shall we say this...old fashioned, and that kind of tells you who is coming through the door.

We had called prior to making our decision, and the buffet lady had told us that the selections were more towards lots of seafood & holiday favorites... We were extremely excited.  No wait, YAY! We paid our $12.00 per person ticket and entered. We saw three different buffet lines, and wanted to hurry and eat. I checked the first line and thought to myself... Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, steamed carrots, fried soggy salmon & pizza.........hmm..........where's the seafood? I look to my left, and see that there is \"Seafood Linguine\".........................is this the \"seafood\" the lady had mentioned? Oh boy. I went to the other line and my jaw dropped.

Upon arrival, I could not believe how much the price was for dinner. It was $16.99 for adults and $11.99 for kids. Total price $49 bucks!  The food was decent but like others mentioned some of the offerings seemed like they were frozen items such as the pizza. The macaroni cheese was definitely boxed but even Kraft mac and cheese looked better than here at the buffet. For the price, there could have been more selections. The salad bar looked unappealing. The desert bar was average. All in all I will never eat at the buffet strictly due to the high cost and average selections.",

Everything is obviously frozen and then reheated until its inedible or its from a can. Nothing was fresh. You have to get your own drinks and the area for that is just a complete mess. I hope you arent wanting dessert......they had ice cream and cookies....that's it.  This was hands down the worst buffet I have ever been to.",

    "text": "Today at 9 p.m. my girlfriend and I walked over to the Circus Circus buffet. when we set down we both noticed how dirty it was.  The wall in the booth was crusted with layers  of food spots and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. When we got to the food line there was a decent selection only none of it looked to have been made with any care and didn't look appetizing, but I chose to get ribs mashed potatoes, green beans and chicken noodle soup. The chicken noodle soup was the only good item. The potatoes we're not mashed potatoes they were more like lumpy, dry potatoes, the green beans were kind of tough and the ribs tasted like frostbite. Needless to say I only took one bite of each. After the couple of bites I decided to just eat the soup and take a small break maybe try something else. When done with the soup I sat there talking with my girlfriend and when I lifted my right arm from my lap I felt something. When I look down I saw a TWO 1/2 INCH ORANGE-ISH RED COCROACH on my arm. I yelled and jumped up in pure disgust. When I told the manager he said,  and I quote \" Really,? I'm sorry but I do believe you\" he than gave me a refund. At this point I'm still disgusted and feel like my skin is crawling. Looking back at it now I'm not too surprised considering the quality and cleanliness  and smell cigarette smoke (in a non smoking room) and mildew smelling air conditioning in our room. Not to mention two out of the three ice machines I tried that did not even work! As far as the cockroach goes I've learned that they feed on scrap food, fungus and smaller insects. They can grow up to 3 inches which only tells me it has been living and probably breeding  there for a while.  This review is just about the Circus Circus buffet, if you're curious on how the rest of the process went check out my review in the Circus Circus hotel section. In a nutshell let's just say CARRIE (HEAD NIGHT CLERK) at the check in desk didn't  care about making their customers feel comfortable after such a disgusting experience! I'm never coming here again and neither should anybody concerned with cleanliness and quality which is pretty much everyone.",

I don't know what kind of food these people that have left bad reviews are eating-this is a buffet, people. An American buffet with American food! There was GREAT variety, and the food was pretty tasty.   If you're worried because of these bad reviews, IGNORE THEM.

Long, long story, but a free room, a night of drinking and late-morning hunger pangs will lead you to the oddest of places and this happens to be one of them.   I made my way through the line and decided to start with some scrambled eggs. I mean, how bad can someone screw these up? Pretty bad actually. They tasted of boxed eggs that had been dressed up a tad. The other breakfast fare was equally as bad as I sampled the bacon and sausage to round out my plate. Soggy, greasy and packed together as they'd most likely been cooked without separating them out into individual strips or links.   Maybe a salad can save me? Honestly, the WORST salad I've ever had. There wasn't much to work with in the first place as far as ingredients go and maybe my choice of oil and vinegar for a dressing wasn't the most creative, but nailing a simple salad has never been a problem... here it was.  Okay, back to the junk food and back to more of the same. Bad, bad, bad! The fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy would make Ol' Colonel Sanders toss and turn in his grave. It was much more breading than meat and the potatoes also had the consistency of a boxed product. The gravy... from a can/jar. Lose, lose, lose...  The Circus Buffet = one bad bet.",

We wanted to show Ian all the acts etc. (That's another story) and needless to say we were hungry running after Ian and wanted to grab a quick bite. Since there was no line for the buffet, we decided to check this out.  Pros: 1) No line 2) $39 for two at a Vegas buffet?  Cons: 1) This place is on par with a Hometown buffet or Golden Corral. If I would have known this, we would not have gone in. (-1) 2) None of the menu items tasted good. Well, other than the root beer from the soda fountain. Meat was not tender, Fried shrimp was undercooked, food itself lacked flavor (-1) 3) Omelette station was closed. (-1)",

The waitstaff looked half asleep and I didn't see a single welcoming smile.  So folks, go down the strip to Paris or the Mirage.",

I would've never gone to this buffet, but I was with a big group of people who was enjoying a day at Adventuredome, and it was the most convenient with all the people. I warned them that it wouldn't be good, but I was overruled. I can't think of one thing I liked. The mashed potatoes, stuffing and macaroni were obviously out of a box and so bland and tasteless. These things are normally good and very easy to make taste good, but not there! All the meats from the carving station were so dry that they tasted like cardboard. I had to stop eating them. Even the drinks were bad although I liked how they had a self-serve beverage area so you didn't have to wait for your drinks. However, the orange juice had a weird taste and probably wasn't real. My favorite food, desserts, was also bad. They obviously were store-bought, frozen type. The only good thing was our waitress, who was very friendly and attentive. I will never, ever go back there again no matter what the situation is.",

Some of the food is better than others--that is why it's a buffet! Try a few things out until you find out what you like :-). Then just go get some more of what you like! Not so hard!

My fiancee and I, having never been to Las Vegas before, booked a long weekend at the Circus Circus hotel (which was a mistake).  After a long day of relaxing by the pool, we decided we'd eat at the buffet for dinner and then hit the town.  Walking into the buffet area we were greeted by a cast of very unenthusiastic employees.  After paying a cashier who could barely crack a smile, we stood in line probably a good 5 minutes waiting to be seated.  This seemed bizarre because the place was half empty.  It didn't help that the woman letting people in the buffet to be seated didn't communicate with us at all and acted as if getting us to a table was a military operation.  Once we sat down, we were let loose to get what we wanted.  Everything was self serve.  They were serving tacos, rubbery fried shrimp, really lame \"orange chicken\", some greasy pizza, and a whole host of other really mediocre stuff.  The salad bar was ok, but the \"bacon bits\" they had out were swimming in a pool of fat.  Even dessert table was a disgrace.  The cookies were hard and mostly tasteless and the pies were a total let down.  They might advertise about the buffet being one of the largest on the strip ... but large does not equal excellence in this case.  Do yourself a favor and pay a few dollars more to get into a decent buffet.",

I was also kind of sad that I couldn't order alcohol throughout my meal.   I must say though, I got pretty excited when I found the kids food section after the first disappointing plate. I'm always happy eating pizza, because for some reason \"bad\" pizza tends to be decent.   Two thumbs up on the frozen yogurt machine, that's one thing I'll never grow out of.",

I am a foodie, so I know what scrambled eggs are supposed to taste like. These eggs were weird tasting. Maybe they were powdered eggs or something. The bacon was excellent.

This buffet offers your basic, American style family dining. But this was a weird-ass food experience. To name a few: Lukewarm stuffing, cold alfredo sauce, crunchy hard-boiled egg (that was already out of the shell, go figure).   Let's not forget the crumb donut with fungus on top that the chef tried to convince us was ink from rubbing against the black-colored basket from the delivery company.   The busboy was really nice, and the lines for food weren't too crowded. I liked that the drinks were unlimited and we got to choose more than one thing (soda, juice, milk, coffee, hot chox), and there were to-go cups for coffee. The dessert offerings were pretty varied but obviously not made in-house - banana cream pie, coconut cream pie, apple, chocolate, cream puffs, soft-serve machine...   After the moldy donut, I decided to call Wells Fargo and they agreed to reverse the charge. I rarely do that, but in this case I felt it was appropriate.",

    "text": "This is hands down one of the worst buffets on the Strip. The only redeeming qualities of this buffet are the cheap price and the small miracle that neither of us suffered food poisoning afterwards. Oftentimes you get what you pay for, but this is still an abysmal value when the food is this bad. Both my wife and I agree that we wouldn't come back even if it was completely free. In fact, you couldn't even pay us to eat here again.  The astute reader may ask that as LV locals we should have known better. Yes, we certainly did, BUT my cousin was visiting and insisted on going here, at least in part because her 18 month old is a picky eater. She was certain that this buffet would have kid-friendly foods that her child would be willing to eat. Having read the lousy reviews about this place but not actually experienced it for ourselves, with great trepidation, we agreed to meet them there, hoping it wouldn't be quite as bad as reported. Unfortunate for us, our hopeful optimism turned to despair when the reality unfolded before our eyes and tastebuds.  For about 45 minutes, we endured the throngs of adults and screaming children waiting to get in. This many people can't be wrong, right? Oh yes, they certainly can and so very, very wrong at that. We were seated close to one of the three buffet lines, but it was all downhill from there. For a buffet that caters to families with small children, you would not believe the near Herculean effort it took to obtain a simple high chair! Finally we get in the first buffet line and are presented with a VERY limited selection of unappetizing items. Please refer to my wife's (Candace C) or others' reviews if you really need the gory details. I am having PTSD just thinking about it. Hey, maybe we'll have better luck with the other two buffet lines. Our collective jaws drop when we realize that all three lines are serving the same food! Maybe the salad and dessert lines will be half decent. No such luck. To add insult to injury, our used plates of barely eaten food continued to accumulate and remain uncleared on our table. With service like that, it's a good thing that the soft drinks were self-serve. But enough of the horror, it's time to wrap things up.  Now typically when I visit a buffet, self-restraint takes a back seat and like most customers, I like to get my money's worth. This is one of the few buffets where I actually left still hungry. That in a nutshell is the take home message. Sorry coz, I love you, but if you insist on coming here next time, you will be dining without us!",

There was not any one food that was excellent.  It was like eating at Golden Corral (better fried fish) at double the price. Even the prime rib was not very good. I think I only enjoyed the desert, the cannoli was kind of a fun surprise.  Anyway, this is not the quality of food one looks forward to when visiting Las Vegas.",

Buts $21 something a person, but you could literally get anything you want to eat and to my surprise its relatively good to my surprise. You walk in and it's setup like a lunch room style sitting but you have choice of sodas,milk,beer, pretty much whatever you like except liquor.    The have pasta,fried foods,healthy foods, fish,chicken,tacos, anything, there's also a full desert bar with fresh baked and cold deserts.  The sitting is very spacious so not really a problem with the sitting. You pretty much serve yourself with cold drinks and food. The waitress or bus person comes to only pick your plate up as you finish your food.",

I loved the prime rib and the ham. The enchiladas are fantastic. None of the food was marked gluten free, though, and when I asked a woman behind the counter if the salad dressing was gluten free or not, she had no idea what I was asking (her English was not great).  So I really took a chance eating there that I wouldn't be getting sick. Normally I would not have eaten there, but our relatives really wanted to go there.  Also, there was not one dessert that I felt was safe to eat. Our waiter was fine.",

The thing we had to watch out for was a lot of sick and sneezing  customers-----one of whom directed his spray onto the carving station (roast beef).

The chicken fried steak was hard and tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. My 11 year literally spit the baked chicken out and my husband found hair in his gravy. Over $100 spent on this buffet and regret every penny. Dont waste your time or money here, you will regret it as soon as you look at the food. This casino makes alot ofmoney, they really need to invest more into this buffet.",

The pasta station and Italian selection were the highlight of the evening. Not to mention the bbq ribs and fresh slices of roast beef. Second, if you read the bad reviews, the majority of bad ones are about the breakfast or service. The place is 100% self serve so there really is no service other then them picking up the plates. The bad breakfast reviews are probably from hungover people dumb enough to pay $20 for breakfast. Get a coffee and a bagel like normal people!",

The choices for the buffet obviously fits circus circus but it's not worth it. It cost about the same as the other great Buffets on the strip so dont dine here. It I have to say it's really Chunty now ..the Atmosphere feels like the Caravan ..I was in line surrounded by Chunts and it felt like we were at the border hoping to get in to the US..it may sound bad but it looked bad. This buffet didn't feel clean..felt...felt....felt...Old. but hey, that's why I wrote this to save everyone from dining in here..come to circus circus only to take your kids to the dome..then again the entrance is too pricy for what you get but for vegas..that's good for them..BUT not for the food..as a matter of fact.. the rooms aren't all that either ..but focusing on the Buffet..Not worth it ..well leave it at 2 stars..oh, and I also took a picture of this kid putting his foot print in the parking lot wall..hopefully Yelp wont delete it",

    "text": "Ok, first time going to dinner without checking on Yelp first! (Ever since I started using it that is.)   Forgot to eat lunch, and had to go catch Illusionist show at Starlite, and just wanted to eat varieties of food without taking a cab or walking so much, and ended up here. I thought some stuff tasted really good but some tasted like it's gone bad or I just didn't like the taste. And seeing reviews of $$$ (FYI over $100) 4 star buffets, it seems like that's a given at ANY buffets in Vegas so I don't regret coming here for $17.99. Actually surprised at a such low rating.   Fried shrimp, sweet & hot salmon, shell lasagna (name?) and clams were delicious!! The beef was ok, horseradish tasted very spicy and very fresh! I thought egg roll tasted very good as well. String beans were good too, and oh yea the salad was VERY FRESH! Btw I only had cold water here (which I usually do at restaurants), and the water tasted very good. I'm a picky water drinker btw lol (I can't believe I just wrote that lol). Hubby said there was no diet coke (that's what we usually drink for soda) and they have only regular sodas.    Mac & cheese tasted old, but hubby liked it. I didn't get any Mexican food, but hubby got some, and Mexican rice I had a bite of  tasted like it's gone bad or just didn't taste good to me. Maybe it was the butter I didn't like. Hubby enjoyed everything tho. But after he was done with everything he couldn't wait to get out of here and said he can't believe he ate such crappy food. Oh really? That's not what I heard when he was eating!   Soft cream tasted good. I guess you're not supposed to take food to go (there was a sign on the door lol) but I took that to go anyway and hubby said \"You're not supposed to!!\" and I was like \"Who cares! It's Vegas! Don't be so serious!\" Hehe   Hubby said that we might get sick from eating this crappy buffet, as he saw me eat a whole bunch of clams, but I felt just fine last night and still feel fine this morning. He said he felt kinda sick last night, and went to the bathroom...I think he was just doing #2 tho lol. I'm sure he was just exaggerating and the nausea was from the cigarette smell at casinos, because he was being pretty negative about pretty much everything last night saying he hates Vegas (this is my first time and second time for him). Yeah I do hate the cigarette smell everywhere and I felt a little nauseous at casinos, but I'm sure they'd stop making money if they make it non-smoking at casinos lol.   I came out of the restaurant pretty darn happy. :)",

There is a lot of variety, including salad bar, carving station with beef and ham, fish and shrimp, many vegetables, fried rice, Mexican food, and a number of desserts. Drinks are self-service. There is not the interaction from servers that is usually found at buffets, and little busing of tables, but it is relaxing. I did not see anyone leave a tip, probably because there was no service. Children, one in particular, screamed bloody murder the whole time, with no intervention from their parents, and one man behind me mooed like a cow every time the children screamed. Buffets in this price range are usually not the most flavorful, but a decent value for the money, and this one fits right into that category. (Also, the other guests offer unexpected entertainment.) I liked carving station beef, fried rice, mixed vegetables, corn on the cob, apple and blueberry pie.",

There was another bar we didn't even make it to, I can't even tell you what else was there that we may have missed!  Lastly the desert bar was sooooo good!  don't get me wrong, I am NOT easily impressed, but when you pay $17 for an all you can eat buffet you really need to be realistic.

Unfortunately food quality has gotten alot worse since the last time I visited. The food is hard, stale, and overcooked. The choice of foods now is also much more limited. The beverage oasis has watered down drinks and broken down mocha machines. Im suprised at how bad things have gotten. At this rate I dony know how much longer they will be able to stay in business.",

We thought the Pink Pony was still around and Richard was all excited to eat there again.  We were sad to find it was no longer in business, but we were starving and decided on the buffet.  This was awful.  Most of the food was completely inedible.  It looked and tasted like it had been out for hours.  It was all greasy and dried completely out.  Richard had prime rib, which was incredibly over cooked and extremely tough.  The best part was honestly the chocolate milk.  Even the cranberry juice delivered from an outside source had a weird, not-quite-right taste about it.

After going through a barrage of marketing and families, our group saw the Circus Buffet Sign only to be seeing a HUGE LINE for just BREAKFAST.   It wasn't a zig zag line, it was just 3 lines and it was short...lol. I noticed that a lot of people are getting a day pass or the All You Can Eat Pass...lol. Geez...talk about Gluttony in the City of Sin. We had four in our party ($10.49 per person) with the 8.1% Sales Tax. Our total was $45.36.  After you pay, you are seated and off you go. There are two sides and the both serve the same things, but from what I heard, breakfast is the best time to go. I got myself eggs, sausages, corn hash, sausage patties, pancake wrapped pie, bacon, and anything breakfast. They had a drink section which is larger than their breakfast area. They had different kinds of milk to sodas..lol. I guess hydration is more important.  One plate of food had done it for me. I got fruit, but it didn't help. It was like they added MSG or something to make you get full fast. Oh well, it was a good breakfast, but wasn't average breakfast. I would like to have seen more or even include Brunch since we came in at 1030am.   Hope you Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",

They just sit there, soaking in liquids for who-knows-how-long. Hard-boiled eggs are tough like rocks and scrambled eggs are cold and unpleasantly mushy. The seafood pasta was bland.

First We waited in a very short line for over a 1/2 hour because the 1 & only cashier was training a new person, which I understand, except when you literally make your patrons wait, wait & wait some more.  Once to the register we learned how much a meal would cost.  Child:  $11.99, Adult $18.99.  Wow! But we figured as big as it was there would be a great variety of food options.  NOT! And the minimal amount of variety they did have didn't taste all that well.  Husband got fried chicken & said it dry, I got fish without any flavor, the guy who was cutting the ham was also making waffles so that the 2 times husband wanted ham & me once, he was unavailable so we never got any.  Daughter was highly disappointed in her food.  I ate mostly salad.  $19.00 for a salad.  Could've gone to Sizzler & got more of a variety for 1/ 2 the price.  Chuck O Ramma has a better buffet than this.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  They had an \"A\" rating hanging up by the register.  We joked they must of paid someone for it, as we rated it a big fat \"F\".",

    "text": "I admit to only trying the buffet once, but really it was hardly edible. Nearly 20$ a person for the dinner buffet and most everything my party of 4 attempted to eat was inedible. The salad bar was very sad with few ingredients. The vegetable dishes were soggy and flavorless. The pasta was soft and mushy. The prime rib was tough and overcooked. I did have an unlimited supply of soda and coffee and my banana tasted pretty normal, but other than that I was sad to have spent the money. I had debated getting a subway sandwhich instead and wished I had stuck to that idea. I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but there are many similar priced buffets that are higher quality. Its hardly worth the price to pay for something that is all you can eat if you can only eat half of what you put on your plate. Service was attentive.",

    "text": "What a pleasant breakfast buffet!  This buffet is not elegant like the Billagio or Wynn buffets down the street but for the price there is more than enough to please. With an omelet bar and breakfast meats, biscuits, waffles and other international foods you cannot go wrong. There were also cereals and fruits available along with coffee, fruit drinks and other beverages.  Not too sure why people complain soo much about this buffet. In Hawaii you could get a below par buffet for one at sizzler's for what we paid at the Circus Circus Buffet for two people.  The only reason why this place didn't get a 5 star was the employees that tended to our table were either yelling over us in Spanish or Filipino to other workers and they seemed a bit rude to us after we were seated.   But all in all it was not disappointing. It was appealing and I had a good 3-4 plates. It sure beats the McDonalds next door that gives small portions for 1/3 of the price, and if you are staying in the circus circus hotel it is definitely worth it if you don't want to walk to find food in what was at the time 20degree weather.",

However I can't even lie, after eating there I can say my experience was nothing but positive. The food was pretty good and even though the selection could have been better, the prices aren't too bad. I couldn't remember going as a kid, but just knew I liked it then as well. Sorry guys, I disagree... not a bad experience for me!",

    "text": "I used to come here when I was younger, probably 7 or 8 ish, the price is pretty dirt cheap and my parents almost always said the food is merely fast-food level. But I thought the food was pretty good. But as I matured, my palate did as well.  The last time I came here was the summer of 2011, I was 13 at the time. Memories were spawned when I walked past here and I decided to eat there. The staff was rather disgruntled due to the fact it is late and I came in with my family. I even heard them quietly say \"UGH, another group?!\" well I am SO sorry that the dining area is a quarter filled and it is 8 in the night. It's Vegas, expect some people to come at night. I couldn't wait to eat the food, but as soon I sunk my teeth in the fried chicken, it was kinda chewier than i remembered it to be and the batter coating is pretty hard. I ended up getting cuts in my mouth from the chicken. It was pretty greasy too. I remember grease flowing from my fingers to my arms.  The sliced lamb was rather lean... None of the food didn't feel special enough to the point of getting seconds.  I went to get dessert instead and got some chocolate eclairs and brownie cake. It tasted rather fake. What I mean by that is that it tasted like you would find it in the freezer section in the supermarket due to its dry and crumbly texture. For the rest of the time, I filled up on sprite and went home to my room to eat cup noodle because apparently, cup noodles tasted a whole lot better. I usually don't rate bad places with one star since I'm pretty lenient with rating, but this place downgraded ever since i was 8 and clearly deserves the one star.",

I came here hoping to recalibrate my Vegas buffet meter and I was looking for something that was a 1 or a zero.  Not to say that there still aren't elements that put them in the running for the worst buffet I have been to - including totally dried out food items, and rude staff.  Long gone are the days when you could eat here for 5 bucks and get the worst case of heartburn in your life. Anything that incorporated a meat mixture tasted like they were using offal in their food long before it became trendy.  But sadly, the price has gone up to just under $20 for dinner and so has the quality.  Now, instead of being horrendous, they have climbed the rank to reach the status of dorm food - just palatable and recognizable enough. (any place that has milk dispensers is guaranteed to be like dorm food)  To summarize my findings and some of the items  Corn dogs - dried out and grey wieners just like you find at AM/PM  Sliced beef - I needed two gulps of water to get this baby down.  Dry dry dry  Fried chicken - greasy and dried out like the Hungry-Man frozen dinners  Taco meat - amazing reproduction of the beef filling used in Taco Bell  Burritos - an exact replica of Tina's 25 cent frozen burritos  Lasagna - Can we say Stouffer's?  Mac n Cheese - Kraft Mac n Cheese is cheesier  and my favorite... there is a station that has some stuff just labeled as \"meat\" - Awesome!!!",

Prior to the fun, we decided to have dinner in the Buffet.  I grew up coming to this Buffet and was so excited for the nostalgic atmosphere as I remember it being a great place to go when I was a child.  We got there and the place had changed drastically from what I remember.  (Granted it had been about 20 years since I last had eaten there.)  However, we paid our $20/person and we continued on going through the buffet line, choosing only a few things that looked appealing.  As we were gearing up for our second plate, we noticed a large cockroach crawling on the ceiling right above the buffet line- of course halting our appetites.  My fiance quietly notified one of the servers about the insect and asked to speak to the manager to get a refund.  However, when the manager showed, he would not acknowledge us and kept his back to us the entire time.  Out of frustration for waiting minutes staring at his back, we ended up just walking out of the buffet to many apologies from the server.  Surprisingly, the buffet had an \"A\" grade.  Sadly, I would not recommend this place to anyone and will not be returning in my lifetime.",

Well as we were walking, I was super hungry and was going to get a McRib at McDonalds but my dad saw a sign for a lunch buffet that was $12.  Okay I was desperate and hungry so we decided to go in.  First bite of mac and cheese and I was in heaven!  The food was good at first but then after awhile, everything just went downhill.  I had a little bit of everything and it seemed pretty mediocre or really bad!  I was so full that i forced myself to eat dessert because you can't have a meal without dessert!  I got some chocolate brownie cake and it was STALE!!  The desserts looked appetizing but all of them were pretty much stale or tasteless.  I think the only thing I enjoyed here after debating for awhile is the coffee:)  Yes, this is a pretty cheap place if you are looking to get some food but I would probably never come back here ever again.

It is a decent sized buffet, with enough variety that you don't get overwhelmed, coffee is good, and it's not super expensive. It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't like 50 dollars a person either.

Last time we ate dinner here I came down with foid poisoning. So I choose not to come here for dinner, plus its 22. 00 per person. Geeez, a lot of money for subpar food.    We did have 2 free vouchers this time, chose breakfast this time.  It was decent.  I did like that they had hot oatmeal and grits.  I an a fan of grits and bacon.  I went to buffet and picked 1 of a few things I might like.  Hubby went to omelet bar..  the omelet had the weirdest tasting eggs.  Like cardbaord for sure.. yucky!!!!  I chose fresh 2 eggs over hard. The bread options for toast were excellent.  The bacon was severely undercooked AND!! THE GIRL BEHIND THE BACON WAS WRINGING IUT THE BACON GREASE FROM THE BACON... YES YOU HEARD CORRECT.  Indian rope burn style wringing.. I was DONE at that point!! Even free has limits for me. The best part was meeting a group from Jamaica and they sat with us..  great bunch of people they were!!!!  I would NOT recommend THIS buffet unless it is FREE. Go to Goldcoast!!! Off of Tropicana blvd down by the Rio!!  Food is better and only 9.00 for card members. 10.00 full price!!!",

We were \"greeted\" by staff that apparently were very tired and just wanted to go home. We went through the buffet, which had food that apparently had been under the heat lamp for most of the day - dry and tasteless. And the carving station chef was less than amenable, requiring us to almost beg him for another slice of meat. I think, for the money, I would drive through a fast food place before ever returning to this buffet.",

    "text": "When you're a kid, all the stories of gambling, strippers and debauchery you hear about in Vegas don't have as much appeal to you as the sound of a buffet; ice cream, doughnuts, spaghetti, meatloaf, sausage and waffles all on one plate?!?!? To a kid, that sounds like an awesome breakfast!  Unfortunately, they don't do \"breakfast\" here....they only do \"brunch\".  After coming here, I've learned brunch is defined as: we're going to call breakfast something different so we can charge you $20.00 per person to eat here, $12.00 per little person, oh, and if you're child is over 3 years old, despite the fact they can only fit a fistful of food in their tummy, you're paying $12.00 too.   Also, they automatically add a $3.00 tip to your bill, so you SHOULD know that (though Circus Circus doesn't think you should, because they won't display that anywhere, or tell you).    Ugh......  The kids weren't impressed.  Not only was the buffet not \"circus themed\" (other than a few abstract paintings on the wall), the food wasn't good at all.  The eggs were overly runny, the spaghetti was about as good as the canned stuff (my kids are used to homemade), the menudo was all tripe....the kids didn't like anything except for their bowl of yogurt.  No joke.   I thought everything I ate was \"OK\" at best.  Nothing incredible.  Nothing to be excited for. NOTHING to pay $20.00 for.   The staff here are all very rude as well.  After reading an (apparently old Vegas blog post, despite being written in July of this year), I asked why my four year old was charged for entry, when I thought 4 and younger were free.  The cashier said, \"Not any more. It's over 3, so she's paying\". I don't know why she thought my daughter would pay, being that she's currently of non-working or wage earning age, but, whatever.  When I asked one of the cooks if they had mac n' cheese today (again, blog post said kids love it), the cook said, \"No\" and walked away.  Maybe if the casino left the tipping up to the individual, rather than sticking you for $3.00 upon entry, the staff would be friendlier, trying to earn tips??? Just a thought.   Oh well, I won't know, because I'll never come here again.",

If you've ever gone to a Sunday brunch buffet at Marie Callendars, where you pay over $15 per person, (about $10.50 at Circus Circus,) you won't find even half the variety or quantity of food that you can find here.  Tons of muffins, desserts, bagels, cereal, eggs, cheese omelets, sausage, bacon, stuffed pancakes, french toast, waffles, biscuits with gravy, grits, donuts, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc... You get the idea. There's tons of stuff.  I don't understand other yelper complaints - it's a buffet, so each food item isn't going to be hand-crafted to perfection with tons of ingredients. You pay the buffet price for a single item to get that kind of quality. Here, again, it's about quantity and variety.  Definitely an ideal spot for anyone with a mild but food-craving hangover.",

The price was low.  We get seated and do the standard walk through to see what was available.  Wow this place looked just like a Country Buffet or Royal Fork.  Fried chicken was really salty and greasy.  Greasy meaning that it had more oil than the normal fried chicken. More than KFC.  The meat cutter at the beef station was really stingy and would only give me one, super thin slice.  I had to go back three more times to get enough to eat.  Did I say he price was low?  The other stuff was very uninspiring. The pasta dishes were mediocre at best.  Salad bar kind of sucked.  For the desserts they seemed like the pies were store bought.  The crusts on the pies were definitely not flakely, more mealy.  In regards to cleanliness, this place needs a good douche. It looks really weathered and needs to update the look to get it out of the '70s.  Did I say the price was low?  Well you get what you pay for.  I don't recommend you eat here unless you just want a large quantity of food for a low cost.",

    "text": "This buffet was pretty bad... my wife the kids and I happened to be in Circus Circus around lunch cause we wanted to watch the free Circus acts and decided rather than un-valet-ing the car we would just make an easy stop at the nearby buffet... Mistake... Unfortunately I did not think to pull up the Yelp first because I was pretty hungry and in the mood for variety. We went around 12:30 but 75% of the buffet was still breakfast/brunch items, I'm guessing because they didn't want to waste any food, meaning that everything out was al old and crusty.  The food quality here was lower than any other buffet I have ever been to. even the salad bar was questionable, they only had one choice of lettuce, and the selection of toppings was just sad and basic.  I thought that it would be safe to go with the fresh cut meats from the filet station but those were dry and bland like everything else. The advertised attraction: endless fried shrimp was rubbery and just tasted like chap grocery store frozen shrimp.  as mentioned before most of the buffet and the stations were breakfast based, while only about a 20ft long section of buffet was lunch items, so it was slim pickings, and what was there was questionable at best. the one thing that was okay in flavor and quality were the chicken fingers, but I'm sure they were just cheap food supply ones.   After eating here I spent the rest of the day with very active uncomfortable \"intestinal operation\" and under no circumstances would I ever eat at this buffet again. If you are reading this, please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else... I know it is simple and easy especially with kids, but just don't do it.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this buffet. First, for me, Vegas = buffets. Usually go to at least one buffet on each Vegas trip. Second, I have fond memories of the circus buffet as a child. They used to have several lines where each line had the same selections.   We went on a Friday for lunch. The price was $20.99. It was too much for what they offered. For me, the food was ok but not worth $21 a person. The only high ticket item was the fried shrimp which were larger than popcorn shrimp but not jumbo. No peel and eat shrimp no smoked salmon. They had carved ham which was decent. My son was able to cobble together a bacon cheeseburger with the shredded cheese (no sliced cheese) from the Mexican station and bacon from the breakfast station. My other son filled himself up with several bowls of their fake lucky charms cereal (labeled malted marshmallows) but not worth what we paid.   The best part of the buffet was the drink selection. They had the Pepsi machine, lots of juices, and lots of milk choices (2%, whole, and chocolate).",

My husband and I even came about two years and the buffet was still okay so we thought that we would bring our daughter. HUGE MISTAKE we went last night and we were both utterly disgusted. The food was horrible and the selection was almost none existent. I was so disappointed I had mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, fried shrimp and pizza. It was all terrible and the fried chicken tasted like it was weeks old. My husband tried to save the dinner and get dessert but it was horrible as well sadly.  I also love to tip for servers so I left an 18% tip but I didn't know that the servers here now only clear your plate which was a huge disappointment as well as you would think they would also at least bring you drinks.  I hate to say this but I won't be back and I wish there was a way for us to get our money back since we had to stop and get food afterwards since we couldn't eat any of the food here.",

This had stale fried shrimp. Hardly anyother seafood. (No lobster, crab legs, crawfish )Most of the food was cold-warmish and had been out for a while.   There were a few items that were decent to eat. Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat!!!!",

Canned refried beans, canned menudo, frozen burritos and chimichanga (bean and cheese), rubbery hard boiled eggs, hasbrowns were rubbery, most food looked really unappealing. Salad bar was ok but tiny with little selection, although this was bagged lettuce too. Omelette station was decent, but I'm not a big breakfast guy, I felt force to get the omelette because everything else was such a let down. I would have rather gone to The Blue Iguana again, that's saying something if you read my Blue Iguana review. I didn't follow what other reviewers advised and I literally paid the price.

We decided to give it a try......Now for the details....  Buffet was clean and well maintained. However food options were limited and leaned heavy on the greasy side.    The staff was nice and kept tables cleared.  Remember this is an older hotel in the MGM family.  Definitely not the strip type.   The omelets were made to order and fresh, the rest of the food was not very tasty and stuck with us the remainder of the day.   I held on a 3rd star due to the food staying with us throughout the day.   Everything is relevant and the corn beef hash was ok, just not \"wow\". The Mexican food and salad bar was limited and tended to be geared for kids. This is a big plus for families with children. Price was reasonable and even included with some players cards.   When in Rome...... and definitely one of the places on our retro weekend.",

However my 1 star review is the fact that I got some of the cream puffs from the buffet, bit into one and something tasted disgusting. I checked and found MOLD on the bottom of the cream puff. The buffet had MOLDY food. I spat it out, took the rest of the moldy food to an employee and showed it to them. The employee took it and showed a manager. The manager gave me a half hearted apology, saying that the cream puffs arrive to them, pre-frozen. Pre-frozen or not, how do you miss literal moldy goods being served to customers? There wasn't any real sincerity and it was obvious they didn't care.   So please don't waste your money here. Unless you want to risk eating food that can make you ill.",

Bragged to the kids how much they were going to love it. $19.99 per adult, $13.99 per child. No bad.  Wrong. So wrong.  Hard pancakes, rubbery eggs, Serve 'n Brown sausages, tiny hard biscuits with watery gravy, greasy overcooked triangle hash browns, thawed caned oranges, pineapple, and pears- flavorless and watery, hard & dry muffins. Didn't try anything at the Asian or Mexican station, as it looked dry and over cooked, or maybe over heated, instant coffee, and Tang orange juice.  Decent- bacon, grits, and coffee cake.  The kids barely ate anything because their pancakes were so hard.  One star because the bus man was singing along to Katy Perry playing overhead and brought us lots of napkins and cleared our plates quickly.  Such a disappointment.",

You want a really good buffet, go to the Wynn, Caesars Palace or the Bellagio where the buffet will run you about $50 pp (add another $15-$20 for bottomless alchohol).  The buffet here for brunch here was about $20 for adults, and $13 for children. I believe my 2 year old was free.  They had a champagne special for a full-size bottle of champagne for $15. Hell yeah!   The food was fine. Nothing special. I don't know why people feel the need to write such negative reviews about a budget buffet. You want a REALLY good buffet with TONS of food to choose from? Go somewhere else and pay more. It's really as simple as that.  I did notice the buffet was missing a couple options you would normally expect at a breakfast buffet like waffles. No waffles??? No home-fried potatoes. Huh??? No pizza for the kids. Really??? And, the only thing being served at the meat carving station was ham. I would have expected at least 2 options at the meat station.  The omelet station was really good.  And the best part is there was no line on a Sunday @ 10am although it was filling up as soon as we got seated.  I probably wouldn't stay at Circus Circus again as this trip was more for the kids but if I did I would have no problem returning for brunch. Not sure I would have dinner here though as there are just way too many really nice restaurants in Vegas to choose from but for brunch it's fine for convenience. And it's cheap!",

I would give it a one star but the two stars are for the waffle machine, kind of hard to use but I found it very cool and amusing that you could make your own waffles.

This place sucks! Food is Luke warm and lacks flavor. Making myself eat because I spent $20. This place deserves negative stars!",

I thought it's a buffet and it's breakfast so how bad could it be?  Well it turns out it can be pretty bad! Very limited choices...you can have burned bacon, cold eggs, watery gravy, unripened fruit, flavorless sausage patties and horrible coffee.  To top it all we left our table to return to the buffet on a second  search for  something edible and when we returned our table had been completely cleared and reset.  They even took the receipt from the table so we then had to argue with the staff that we were actually sitting there.  Definitely the worst buffet in Vegas.  You have been warned.",

It's essentially a combination of all the worst things: a chaotic, windowless \"restaurant\" in the far back of a mazelike circus-themed hotel, with an extensive menu reminiscent of airplane or cafeteria food. (the mac and cheese was astonishingly horrible, in a orange/plastic-y cheese kinda way, and everything else just had that gross, re-heated/over-processed taste to it)   Being in a bleak, dated, windowless room with stale food and the sounds of several children screaming/crying was bad enough. I was sure that I was truly in the ultimate purgatorial situation when OF COURSE some clown on stilts** walks into the restaurant and maintains eye contact with me long enough for me to drop everything and uhhmaybe run out of the restaurant and uhhmaybe leave my boyfriend behind. (Note: you prepay before you enter the actual buffet, so it's not like I just left without paying!)  **to be fair, my fear of clowns should probably have been addressed before agreeing to eat here, because WHY WOULDN'T there be a dude dressed as a clown waltzing through the place and staring whomever they please? REGARDLESS this still doesn't change the fact that this food is not actually food and the ambience is downright bleak. Don't waste your time!",

A five year old could do a better job of boiling pasta. How do you ruin pasta?? You have to clueless, careless, or miserable about your job.   They should stop the people at the front from taking money until this place is fixed. I can't believe other people have had the same complaints for a very long time. Guess I should have read the reviews first like I normally do, but when you're drunk you're just thinking you want to eat ASAP.  Well my fellow Vegas happy and hungry drunkies - please do us both a favor. Go elsewhere and get yourself a beautiful and delicious meal that is worth your money and doesn't hurt to look at.

It was the type of buffet where people are staggering around like farm animals with glazed eyes as they belly up to the trough.  It was quite crowded, with lines at most of the stations, and the food was mediocre.  There was a lot of chicken, some fried shrimp, and other traditional offerings such as barbeque and enchiladas.  However, again the salad bar was fresh and had some healthy choices.    The scariest item was probably the hot, glutinous, neon yellow cheese at the baked potato station.    If you're staying at the hotel it is worthwhile and quick for breakfast but not worth waiting for at any time if there is a line.",

For a hotel that continued to fall short of mediocre, I hoped the buffet would be good, considering the price. I got exactly what I paid for in LasVegas. The other buffets are maybe 5 to 10 dollars more per person but you will easily get twice the selection of this place. Trust me, spend the money , if you eat here you'll be wishing you didn't.",

I decided to to write them on March 8th and explain what happened in hopes they would actually give a response that showed they care, nearly 2 months later, no email response back from them.    It is more than apparent that their response here on Yelp  is little more than gratuitous PR grab.

When we came in the staff were nice they clean your table all the time. But the food was disappointing its like there was barely any seasoning. So you try to eat other things that you dont normally eat just to satisfy your hunger but nope. The only thing that really had a taste was the fried chicken a bit salty but atleast it has a taste the corn taste like water like literally. They didnt have much of a selection either so if you didnt like most of the food you just wasted your money. But i always try to give a benefit of the doubt and tried the desserts maybe i can fill my stomach in with something sweets but no the pastrys was dry as f@^#. What i enjoyed the most here was the soda atleast it didnt taste like water down drink.",

There was a Muslim lady, no English, pointing with a fork to the meat on a breakfast pizza, it was obvious to me she wanted to know what kind of meat it was but the lady working there kept telling her it was a pizza!  She kept shaking her head and pointing to the actual meat to no avail.  I stepped in and asked the meat, was bacon which she understood and smiled and walked away. Buffet items were too greasy, eggs at omelette station were snotty and undercooked. Coffee was actually quite nice.  If it was cheaper then I imagine it would be an actual Circus in there.

After a long wait I paid for us, and my first surprise was over $60 for the three of us (no extras such as beer). Ok I thought, for that price the food must be very special (steaks, prime rib etc.). We went to our table, and noticed many other empty tables. Why the long wait to be seated?   Anyway, at least the food must be good to make up for the unnecessary wait. No it wasn't. None of us could believe the appalling selection. The carvery only offered ham. Not a steak, roast beef or prime rib in sight. Apart from, it was basic breakfast food (eggs, greasy sausages, bacon), tacos, cereals, deep fried battered shrimp. The desserts were also poor.  For over $20 each I felt robbed. The worst buffet experience we've had, ever. To think we could've had a decent buffet at our hotel (Palace Station, $7 each). Instead I forked over $60 for a glorified greasy breakfast selection (at 1:30 pm!).   You may be making money short term, but word will get around and in the long term you will lose many customers.

The staff was friendly and helpful. Overall a great breakfast buffet!",

If you think without being enraged for spending $20+ for dinner buffet, you can see, they're actually helping the nature by not wasting any food. Food from the breakfast or even leftover food from yesterday. You'll find fossils of fried shrimp, fried chicken or anything fried. The demand is so high that you should consider yourself lucky for getting half boiled rice. I was surprised to see that they got seawater in the middle of the desert to make most of their soups or other items. They finally figured out how to use perfect amount of food color to look rubber to look like beef at the curving station. I wish, they'd find a way to taste that just a bit close to beef. Most amazing is the dessert section! They already know, you won't be able to taste anything after eating those msg & salt infested, bland, dry, hard, chewy & flavorless food, that's why they have the tiniest, most unappealing & unattractive selection of pies & cakes.  The only thing that we could eat was pasta from their pasta section (shout out to their pasta lady working on Wednesday night 07/05/17) & ice cream.  Management stop giving damn about this place or never gave it anyway. They know already people staying here most like are gonna come anyway. So from management to employees or cook, they all just make sure they have something on the tray which I refuse to call food",

I got so much shrimp it was worth the price just for that plate. they warm it up in front of you. they come to pick up your plates every time you're done with it. overall, the food was decent and the pasta bar was the best part. they are not shy with the sauce or shrimp.",

I don't think tipping workers to cook you something up, in $30 breakfast buffets, are in order, especially when they don't do so with a smile.   The food was not good at all. Pancakes were crumbly and looked and tasted to be, \"day old.\" My little grandson, stated they were nasty.   I will not return.

Save your money and the potential for food poisoning, eat elsewhere.

Staff is unhappy, and some have an attitude like they are in a rush or you are bothering them. The line to amount of open tables does not make sense.  The food has about as much flavor as cardboard. It reminds me of my college dining hall. Thank god for BBQ sauce, Tabasco and syrup or i wouldn't realize i was eating food.  For about $10 more you can get a flawless meal at Bellagio.",

Food here is bland, not seasoned at all. Mostly it was designed for kids.   Overall, it will fill you up without tingling your tastebuds. Waste of money. Go eat Old Country Buffet for the same type of food at a cheaper price. (Except Old Country Buffet is actually good.) Drinks are self serve and waiter service is really slow.   If you are going to spend money on buffets, spend a little more and you'll be glad you did.",

One of the worst things I could say about this place is that Home Town Buffet is a step up (if you're familiar with this restaurant I speak of, and you disagree, then the Circus Circus Buffet may be the place for you).",

    "text": "We stopped by the Circus Circus buffet for lunch after taking a break from Adventuredome and I have to say that this might be the worst buffet I've been to. It's a toss up between here and the buffet at South Point. Circus Circus might win out for the worst buffet because their employees weren't very friendly and did a terrible job of cleaning plates off tables.  First of all, let me address the food. I've been spoiled by going to the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and M Resort where the selections are endless and quality is top notch. But, here... dios mio... it's abysmal. They have four different stations: breakfast, lunch, salad, dessert.  Breakfast - waffles: soggy - pancakes: dry and hard - bacon: burnt  - cheese blintzes: ok - sausage: you can get better quality in the frozen food section of any grocery store  Lunch - mashed potatoes: good - taquitos: dry, hard to swallow - fried shrimp: decent - pizza: reminded me of cafeteria food at my high school - chicken fingers: limp, the breading was a little soggy - penne pasta: average - green beans and mixed veggies: average - They also had burgers and fried chicken which i didn't try  Salad Bar - pasta salad: decent  Desserts - cookies: the best this buffet has to offer. - brownie: dry and crumbly. - carrot cake: dry and crumbly. - raspberry cheesecake: mushy but decent  There just wasn't much to choose from in this buffet and the stuff they did have was poor quality. We tried most of what they had, but nothing was above average. When your best items are mashed potatoes and cookies you know you're in trouble. The service was just plain bad. We had a pile of dishes sitting on the edge of our table that wasn't picked up until we were ready to leave. Thank god we got free passes to this place because I would be pissed if I actually had to spend money to eat here.",

    "text": "The Skinny: $14 per person for fake mashed potatoes and three buffet lines serving the same stuff (ought to be 0 stars), no service (0).  My hubby's cousin was in town and really wanted to eat at Circus Circus because their 18 month old was with them. Trust me, if it was up to us, we would never venture into this place especially on a Memorial Day Weekend. We went in line and waited 1/2 hour.  Went in thinking - well how badly can they mess up hamburgers/hot dogs/french fries. Oh, you should be so lucky to have those things at the buffet!  They had a very limited selection of food items - if you could qualify what they're serving to be food. French beans cooked until brown, mashed potatoes you make from a box, \"burritos\" that taste worse than frozen ones,  poached fish that probably was sitting in the same liquid for days (yes, it started to have that bad fishy smell)... I could go on and on but I'm not. Needless to say that when I saw this, hamburgers and french fries from McDonalds sounded like ambrosia.  And get this... their buffet line is three lines of the exact same thing. How this mediocrity could be repeated 3 times over is really beyond me.   Usually I have something good to say when it comes down to dessert. Tried their lemon meringue pie and it was awful. Texturally, the crust was soggy, the lemon curd was like really bad fake jello and the meringue tasted like plastic. Eww-eww-eww.  Honestly, I feel very lucky for my husband and I to have endured this ordeal without a bout of gastro afterwards.  There are so many places better than this - really. I never believed I would say this, but the food at Mickey D's is better than this and has better value.",
