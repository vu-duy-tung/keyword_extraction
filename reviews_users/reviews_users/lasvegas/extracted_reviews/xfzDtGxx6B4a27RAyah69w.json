I love that their kitchen closes at 1am-2am with a 50% off menu that lasts ALL day and they change the items every week.  Although not on the 50% off menu, the Cherry Blossom and Screaming Orgasm dishes are musts! I'm told the Cherry Blossom is presented different each time, but I'm not sure... either way, it was so pretty that I almost didn't want to eat it. The owner is always extremely nice and welcoming. Great service and great food.",

The taste on their roll selection was great, fresh and very well crafted. The only part that I would like to see a change in is that they should start serving half rolls. That gives a much better experience to the \"all you can eaters\" and that it's a big deal for me. The more I can taste, and the better experience I have, the more likely I am to return and become a regular.   Keep it up and please start serving half rolls!",

I couldn't taste it, either they didn't mix it in or with such a small amount.  Beside that it was great.  Services 5/5  Services were awesome, friendly sushi chef, his name is Johnny.

I'm one of those weird people though who need a little rice with her sushi, hence the rolls.  I was really craving some softshell crab, but the roll we ordered was just chopped up imitation crab, which I did not care for.  The other roll we ordered was a spicy tuna with other stuff and that was really good.    All in all, it was a good experience.  The restaurant was a bit empty at 9:30pm, and the service was quick and friendly.  The prices are very reasonable too.  Definitely one of the better non-strip sushi places.",

The service is professional and well planned.  And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent.  The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight.  The popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount.   Also, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw.  Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi.",

I was lukewarm on my specialty roll - if it weren't swimming in ponzu I'd have probably liked it more. The spicy salmon roll was better, for me anyway.

The waitress tells me right when I walk in that I made it in time for the all you can eat lunch special for $21.95. So I thought okay cool I'll go ahead and order a couple of things. First of all, it was slow. Nobody was in the restaurant but myself and yet it took 20 minutes for a sushi roll. On top of that, they messed up my order. I asked for a spicy tuna hand roll and instead of what I asked for, I got some crab roll. I brought this to their attention and instead of helping, they just brushed it off like no big deal. I asked for my check, that took another 10 minutes, mind you I'm still the only one in the restaurant, and when I finally got it, it was wrong. THEY WERE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE DINNER PRICE! I asked the waitress why is it that I was told it was still lunch and yet I'm getting charged for dinner. She said it was because it was 3:02 when she put the order in and lunch ended at 3. WHAT? She was the one that specifically told me it was still lunch time. She went to go see if her manager can excuse it and give me the lunch price and he said fine I'll give you the lunch price but we're going to charge you the hand roll you didn't touch. Um. You messed up MY order and then expect me to eat it all? I was infuriated. Worst experience ever. I'm never coming back to this sushi place. There are so many other sushi places close by that are better than this one, and they have better service. Don't waste your time here.",

I used to live a block (or so) away from this place, and ate here (or grabbed take out) sometimes three times a week.  Loved it. LOVED it!  The prices were fantastic, very affordable, especially given the quality of the food.  Damn good!  The service...always friendly, though communication was often limited.  There was the occasional cash register dilemma...usually with a new server who didn't quite have the hang of it...but whatever, i was gonna be waiting anyway, no worries.  My favorite sushi chef was a blonde-dyed guy who would only give his name as \"Josh.\"  That's cool, man.  My name was still Robert, and our high fives were many and heart-felt.  Your skills were finely honed, your humor genuine, and your creative flair MUCH appreciated by this humble diner.  Whether I was there alone or with a lady, when seated at the sushi bar I was always treated like a prince.  Never failed to be gifted with some special sushi treat, a custom concoction from Josh.  Yeah, my generous tips may have had something to do with this, but hell...how many times do generous tips just get absorbed into the gelatinous maw of the self-important?  My man appreciated the money, no doubt, but probably not as much as I appreciated his craft and attitude.  I had too many good meals here to go into specifics, and a lot of the rolls I had weren't even on the menu.  Suffice to say I never left disappointed, and even when doing take-out, everything was always very fresh and delicious.",

The vegetables were very overdone and the shrimp was very small and still had the tail on them which I would have preferred if it wasn't on there.  It also came with a salad that had a few bad pieces of lettuce in it. The vegetable tempura and the California roll was the best part of the meal.  Also included your choice of either white rice or brown rice.  I chose brown.  After tax and trip it was $17.00 which I definitely don't think it was worth it for lunch. Overall, I've had much better.",

So we decided to get some take-out from Sushi 21 for lunch.  Since my friend is still new to the world of sushi, we decided to stick to rolls, and mainly to ones she had tried already. So I called in and ordered a Philly roll, a Spicy Tuna roll, and a Las Vegas roll. I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.   The rolls weren't ready when I arrived, I waited a good 5-10 minutes for them. Service was friendly though,  and the rolls were fairly inexpensive, the total was $22 and change.  The rolls were tasty although the Philly was a little loose, they kept falling apart on us...  Generous amount of tuna in the Spicy Tuna roll, and I appreciated that they gave us eel sauce on the side for the Las Vegas roll.   Was this the best sushi ever? No, not even close. But it's inexpensive and close to work, so it's likely I will eat there again...",

    "text": "UGH. UGH. I was in Vegas for a business trip and picked this AYCE (26.95 dinner) over another 2 in the area and I am SO glad I did! This place is so good that I felt compelled to start this review while I'm still eating but probably won't finish since the food is that good. Haha.   The AYCE menu is pretty extensive and impressive.. With 45 appetizers, 27 nigiri selections, 15 classic rolls, 12 deep fried rolls, 52 special rolls, 9 baked rolls and some dessert options.   What I ordered:   Nigiri; salmon, garlic tuna, white tuna, octopus, yum yum scallop. The nigiri here isn't buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness but for AYCE, it's definitely above average and I don't think you'd complain.   Sashimi chef choice: it was salmon and same as above.   Oysters: so big and good! Only one order per person though.   Crawfish: this dish is so yummy. It's a bunch of crawfish cooked in a delicious sauce. It is a bit greasy though and for a fellow fatty like me to say that means a lot because I love grease. It does have a kick which is great.    Baby octopus: they're actually pretty big for being \"baby\" and I liked them but without the sauce, they're kinda bland.   Seaweed salad: a must at every sushi restaurant for me and this one was great!   Orleans roll: OMG. This is the best sushi roll I have EVER had. I love cream cheese in my rolls. If you do too and you love salmon and spicy mayo, get this roll. The spicy mayo is actually spicy which is so awesome. This roll makes me want to move to Vegas. Okay that's me being dramatic but seriously, it's just really good okay?   I got the strawberry, green tea and red bean ice cream for dessert and both were good!   The waitress that was working was such a sweetheart too. She was so nice that when she told me they ran out of uni today, I didn't even get upset and if you know me, I NEED my uni. Hopefully I get to try it next time cause I definitely plan on returning someday!",

    "text": "This place is REALLY good!!! If you are looking for an AYCE sushi bar then you should give this place a shot hands down. Their menu is comprised of 81 items for entrees and 45 items for appetizers on the AYCE menu alone. There is absolutely no limit for how much you can order or \"Rounds\" as some places limit you by having 3 rounds of food. Pricing isn't bad either their lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 26.95 which is standard in California(where I am from).   Personal recommendation would be the S.W.A.T roll and the Rattle Snake roll. Those two were definitely among my favorite with Eel in them. But they also have your usuals as every other place, but also have many other rolls and twists from a usual to spice it up a bit. There is Bound to be something on their menu you will LOVE. Another recommendation for my mushroom fans is the Mushroom Cap. It's a mushroom upside down with crabmeat topped with baked goodness.  I could get into detail about the things I ate but really, just go and enjoy some delicious Sushi!!! I gave this place a shot since I was in Vegas and was completely satisfied. I am sure you will too!!! Good luck Yelpers!! I hope my review helps you choose your next restaurant :)",

Going in we check in and there was a 10% off with Yelp check in which was nice, As soon as we were seated I showed the guy who was going to be our waiter,  His name was Jay and he was very helpful. We told him we had never been there before and did not know what to order, He asked what we liked and we explained we were fans of Yama Sushi and he told us he had been there before so he was aware of what we explained we liked and that we did want lot of rice to whatever we ordered. , It was really nice you can order 1/2 orders on the rolls. Were not big on the rolls especially if there is a lot of rice. We do not want to pay for AUCE and have tons of rice that is not why we like Sushi. I want to taste the flavors and enjoy what I am eating. Jay did a great job picking out some items. One of my all time favorites they make here Japanese Lasagna and he brought out 1/2 roll. That was really good here. I was not crazy about the dynamite with all the corn in it. This was completely different than what I have had before,  Over all service was very good, food was really good and well worth stopping in. We really enjoyed trying this new place out! This may become one of our favorite places to stop in for dinner!  The fried oreo was really good, never had one before and we both really enjoyed trying it out! We highly recommend this place! It was a neat dining experience!",

In fairness, some of the sauces may have just been foreign to me, but neither me or my friend liked much of any of it.  As much as I love sushi, I ended up not even being able to eat much even though I was still hungry, because I just didn't enjoy the taste.  The service was great.

The rolls are beautiful and come out very quickly. The staff was very polite and attentive.   I recommend ordering fresh wasabi root and ask the staff for their personal sushi favorites. Also, hard to go wrong with the sashimi chefs choice. It is part of the all you can eat menu.   My one critique is that the menus are really dirty.",

I've been going to Goyemon for years and little did I know that this gem was less than half a mile away! Their menu has so many adventurous and DELICIOUS options!!! Their appetizer list for dinner is also very impressive! I recommend trying the monkey balls and the cajun albacore sashimi! The only thing I don't like is that they limit you to ordering two half orders per person, I'd like to be able to try different rolls without ordering full rolls!  I'll definitely be coming back!!",

I've been here before and while the food is mediocre, it's the closest place to my house that has bento boxes.   As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by amused smiles from the sushi chefs as they told me they were closed. When I informed them that Yelp said they closed at three and the door was unlocked, they said last seat is at 1:45. Okay, great, but I'm here for take-out. They then said the kitchen was already closed.   I'm sorry, but if you close the kitchen at 2:00 AM, make that your close time. Now I've wasted my time and you've got a customer never coming back for your C+ at best bento boxes.",

The only thing that's changed is the mussels I couldn't get enough of them before this time around they didn't seem as good. They are using a new sauce the previous ones where better.  Sushi 21 has always been one of my favorite sushi spots but I would avoid it at all cost to avoid dealing with there service. We're happy to say we can be back to our regular visits.",

Our waitress was nice enough to check on us but she was more focused on us eating our rices instead of to see if we actually are enjoying the food. All she keep saying was you have to eat the rice you will be charged extra. We been to another sushi place and they charged us $1.50 for our leftover rice so we thought it would be fine. To our surprise they charged us extra $18 for like 8 small pieces of rice. That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Thank for your crappy sushi we're never coming back to this place.",

We had to ask for refills and when the last of our party came and sat with us for 20 min, we still have to ask for a place setting.    I do have to say popcorn lobster and seared salmon was the highlight of our meal.  majority of the rolls were stuffed with crabmeat as filler.  Definitely not better than Goyemon.

My parents had money so they taught me when you want to eat out make sure you're ready to spend money. I've actually tipped people 50,60 even 75% of my check before. I work in restaurant. I know it can be a struggle sometimes. But with that being said. That means I also know what bad to excellent service is. This server was the worst. She seemed like she hated her life. Then towards the end I asked for the check and a Togo box. She says ok no problem , then proceeds to the food runner and he comes and tells us it's a charge to take the food Togo. That's not my issue. My issue is she didn't tell us and then she had him give us the bill. Had him pick up the bill. And drop my change off. I was highly offended that as my server she couldn't communicate with us. I felt she was scared of me for some reason and I was nice the whole time. But that's the 3rd time in spring valley they make me feel so unwelcomed. (Server / was either Hispanic or white with chubbie face and dark hair. Keep an eye out for her",

Seeing as though we were ravenous an hour wasn't going to cut it. This place was the exact opposite of Sushi House Goyemon with only a few patrons. At least I wasn't bored since the guy next to us was apparently a pimp trying to hire the girl he was with to his escort service. It was quite entertaining to hear him talk about his business as though it was a Fortune 500 company. I almost expected him to say, \"we offer all our ho's 401ks too\". Ok this was totally off topic but it was much more interesting than what Sushi 21 tried to offer in terms of food. The iced tea tasted like mop water but seeing as though I was tired and not in the mood to quibble with waitress, I tolerated it. We ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and it was decent but not special. I ordered the #4 Spicy Crabmeat Roll and the #20 Roxy Roll. The Spicy Crabmeat was very underwhelming and I left half of it on the plate. A sushi chef messing up something as simple as a crabmeat roll is like a pastry chef messing up a batch of cookies. The Roxy Roll was the complete opposite however. This delightful roll saves this place from a dubious 2 stars. One of the best speciality rolls I have had anywhere. I would definitely hit this roll up again. Despite the ho hum experience here I would be willing to go back but probably never will. Vegas simply has too many restaurants to visit for anyone to visit a 3 star place more than once.",

Each roll contained eight servings, which I didn't expect. The variety and choices were countless. My favorites were the Vegas Lasagna, Tuna Poki and Lobster Crunch. It was a delicious and incredibly filling meal. Will totally return each time we're in Las Vegas. Loved it!!",

My impatience and hunger cost me this time.  I give 1 star for the something wrong 69 roll which is somewhat similar to my favorite pastel roll. I also give 1/2 a star for the busser who was quick to come and pick up our plates and refill our drinks. The last 1/2 star is for the deep fried Oreo. It doesn't compare to mermaids on Fremont street but it got rid of the sushi taste.  The servers are basic, no suggestions for 1st timers to their establishment and no small talk that generally increases tips. We had to say excuse me several times to order food (despite the 7 total seated tables) but at the end of the meal they became attentive. Oh and we ordered a few things that never came out but I'm thankful for the mistake since the nigiri pieces are thin, the rolls are drenched in one sauce or another so the rice is soggy and most of the hot food was over cooked (popcorn lobster & baked aka crispy mussels).    As pictured I'd recommend that no presentation that includes fish should have any green sauce. Not cute. Not tasty. No thank you.",

The restaurant was empty (on a Friday night) and we were seated right in front of the sushi bar. I felt like I was on watch the entire time.   Menu items are priced to make AYCE a better deal. The sushi had more rice than fish. They don't have sashimi in their buffet menu and you're expected to eat all your rice. Many of the rolls were fried and/or drenched in sauce, disguising their low quality fish. Presentation was lacking. My maki rolls basically looked like kimbap with fish in it. My server wasn't really knowledgeable of the items and didn't know the answers to my questions. Not a big deal, assuming that he's new. Won't be coming back, given that there's plenty of other sushi restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "FIRST OF ALL, THIS RESTAURANT IS RIDICULOUSLY MANAGED. HOW DO YOU EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO WRITE A REVIEW EVEN BEFORE YOU EAT THEIR FOOD AND EXPERIENCE THEIR SERVICE? THEY OFFER 10% DISCOUNT IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE REVIEW YOU WROTE. THATS JUST SO SKETCHY. SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE HIGH RATING OF THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE REVIEWED FOR THE 10% DISCOUNT.  I walked in the restaurant with the boyfriend and OH MY GOSH, I have never seen a waitress that look so rude and mean before in my life. She had hell of an attitude that just showed so clearly on her freaking face, the way she talked and handed our menu. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOURE GOING TO GIVE A DIRTY LOOK LIKE YOU DID, CAN YOU NOT WORK? NO CUSTOMERS WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AND DINE THERE WITH THE CRAPPY SERVICE YOU 'THINK' IS SERVICE.  So you think I am overreacting? Oh hells no. I have to admit I am very sensitive about customer service. My boyfriend? He likes to keep it to himself and he always tries to stop me if I want to complain to the waiter/waitress. He was the FIRST one to tell me about that waitress. He immediately felt like he wanted to leave but we already stopped by 2 restaurants before this one and we were just SOOOOO HUNGRY to go elsewhere.  Sushi was so thin. PERIOD. Fish to rice ratio was so bad. Too much rice and fish was so thin that it was so TRANSPARENT. We didnt order much on our first batch and there were only one or two other tables besides us and it took FOREVER to get our order. We specifically asked no sauce on any of our nigiri and they forgot and put sauce on it. I told that rude waitress about it and she went to go tell the sushi chef and she comes back asking very ruthlessly, 'are you not going to eat that?' I wanted to freaking get up and tell her off because of her arrogant attitude. UGHHHHH. Miso soup was salty as hell. I took a sip and put it to aside.  You can only order two rounds compared to three at other restaurants. I dont know why this restaurant is still in business and not only that, they definitely need to re-hire the servers and get rid of the rude and arrogant ones. Also, fish meat has to be much more thicker. The sushi chefs need to be more professional. They curse and talk too much when making sushi. They walked out of restaurant with the apron on and came back inside and didnt see then washing hands EVEN THOUGH they wear gloves to make sushi.  I wanted to go to Goyemon but their wait was way too long for two hungry stomachs. This restaurant was probably the worst one out of my Vegas trip this week. I didnt want to leave any tip for the waitress and I do not feel bad about not leaving tip because I have no reason to give her any. My boyfriend said to leave it for the other waitress that was slightly 'better' than the rude one.  I am korean and I do go to Korean owned susbi restaurants because AYCE sushi is mostly ran by Koreans BUT!!! This place is missing every component of a good restaurant.  1. Good food. 2. Good service. 3. Good portion.  I am not sure IF this restaurant is affiliated with other Sushi 21 in California in cities like Oceanside and San Pedro but one of them is CLOSED and the other one is BARELY running.

HONESTLY would have to say that is pretty much all that is really good about this place in my opinion... only because I am a definately picky sushi eater but you can't expect too much from an AYCE place I guess.   We always just let Justin prepare anything & we tell him which fishes we don't like. Presentation of the dishes are cute & fun.   Service from the chefs seems to be a LOT quicker than the serving staff though. But it could have also been because maybe they thought the chefs would just do all the work.  One this that did kind of bother me visually was the employees that were eating & drinking at the sushi bar & the just strolling around the resteraunt in their pjs.... but maybe they could have been the owners who knows...  Overall not really a place I would come back too often maybe once in a blue moon kinda place.",

Before going vegetarian and even after I'd rate this place based on service - cleanliness and decor as your run of the mill sushi joint. It's not anything to run home to mom about but nothing terrifyingly awful that I'd tell you to stay away.   It's just kind of there if you're hungry and it's open and available.   Although -- the way they make the cucumber salad I must say is just very lazy. It's a pickled cucumber as opposed to the traditionally sliced and cut with dressing cucumber-- mucho disappoint.",

I trust my fellow yelpers and my friend Shayda had only positive things too say about it. Cool. New tradition take my roommate out for his birthday some AYCE sushi.   I never knew they had great HH prices half off rolls and all you can drink for $10 added charge only if you get the AYCE. Right off the bat talk about making great first impression with the specials. I like dam already have reason too come back again.   Talk about small place not too many booths, the sushi bar has nice amount of seating (two nice widescreens that can watch sports; one got too be close too 50' right on the corner and another smaller widescreen slightly off the side) though, and of all things even have tiny koi pound (more like baby size ones or look like but YES actual fish in it) interesting. More in the back area they have a projection screen type playing music videos and feels little more like asian club cause can hear the music good in the restaurant. Lot of stuff going on comes too the decor for such small place. Honest I kind of fan breaks up the traditional sense of sushi restaurant.   The sushi ordered mostly nigiri that always given whenever I go AYCE style. I felt like ALL the fish I had was fresh, looked great, and tasted awesome. White Tuna, Hamachi, Albacore, Uni (not fresh; so took it for what is worth OK), scallops not what I expected or say am use too, Salmon, Cajon Albacore, and Unagi. My roommate birthday boy ordered two rolls tried both. Nothing wow factor so not remember what it was. I ordered spicy yellow tail hand roll. It was one of my favorite sushi the whole night. They don't really list hand roll on the menu more cut it up rolls. The sushi chef was great not problem at all. The only thing that feel like lack for five star is diversity comes too the menu. Unlike my only five star comes too sushi goyemon they offer more different cuts of fish, special menu with bunch of grill items, and diversity.   The service was fabulous! We were constantly being checked up on. Too drinks never even had chance too get half empty before asked if needed refill. The sushi chef was very friendly. Awesome! Nothing worst sitting at sushi bar the sushi chef stay all stuck up. Sushi 21 if want football (MNF style)  no worries about being packed getting your fill in. We sat front and center too the tv the whole game. Winnah! It always helps that not only is it so close too goyemon no worries about it being packed. But it always nice second option if line too long just being down the road.   Sushi 21 solid choice comes too AYCE sushi. I will be coming back again get some of that all you can drink in.",

This is not sushi. This is garbage. STAY AWAY!  The quality is absolutely horrible.  Something that stood out was the uni.  This was THE worst sea urchin I have encountered in my life. It was faaaaar from fresh, and the consistency was disgusting.  I have eaten fresh uni in Tsukiji fish market in Japan, right out of the sea urchin, still moving... So I know exactly how fresh and good uni should taste.  I dont know what I was thinking expecting it from this restaurant.  It is Korean owned, and not authentic Japanese sushi.  The sushi \"chefs\" did not know the proper way to prepare the dishes or what sauces go with which.  They are also not very good at preparing sauces, as we had a roll that came out tasting exactly like a sour lemon... Ummm yikes!  Please wait the extra 20 minutes and go to Goyemon.  You'll thank me later.",

But shortly after i went home i felt my stomach aching. I initially thought it was just due to having a little bit too much to eat. But then, after about 3 trips to the bathroom within 2hrs i knew something was wrong. Very wrong. I was vomiting heavily while still having excruciating pain in my upper stomach as well. As im writing this review, it has been almost 48hrs after i ate there (3:30 a.m. 3-5-2019) i was woken up by my hurting stomach again. Couple trips to the bathroom and vomitted again. They were actually featured on our local news \"dirty dining\" segment a while back and there were few cases of food poisoning reports here as well. How i wish i did plenty of research before going in there!",

As soon as we sat, there happened to be a lady towards the back of the restaurant waiting for a take out order (thank god) I'm not one to shame, but her kids were screaming and hitting each other and crying. The mother then screamed and cussed back. Since there was only three tables in the whole place you can imagine how awkward this was and nobody did anything about it. They probably screamed for about 10 minutes.   When things finally calmed down we were able to think and order some appetizers. The miso soup, spicy garlic edamame and corn cheese was really good! The Gyoza weren't anything special! We had the garlic tuna, shrimp, and yuzu yellowtail nigiri! Pretty delicious!! As for the rolls, I didn't get the \"wow\" factor. We actually ended up sending one back because their crunch roll wasn't anything like we were used too.   I think the real winner here was the deep fried Oreo dessert. We truly do appreciate originality and that's something you don't typically see on an AYCE menu.   The food was very hit or miss, but when it hit we loved it! Unfortunately, we decided before we had even left that we wouldn't be returning. Ultimately because of that screaming lady.",

They have really good deals, each week they pick about 10 different rolls that are half off. I ordered Sean's roll which was delicious and half off. The salad they give you as a starter isn't very good due to the dressing that isn't very flavorful. Other than that I was super satisfied. Also we took a chance and tried the green mussels for an appetizer which ended up being very good. Needless to say, I'm going back today for lunch.",

I ordered the Agedashi tofu and Eel Bowl.  When I got the agedashi tofu it was served with Ponzu and not the traditional dashi sauce.  When the sushi chef asked me if everything is ok I told him no and can I have some tempura sauce.  the server came to me and told me that it's supposed to be served with ponzu sauce.. Then i Replied \"no it's not.  The name of the dish tells you what it is.  It's called agedashi because age means to deep fry and Dashi is the sauce that it's served with\".    the Eel bowl to my dismay was served on top of sushi rice and not regular steamed rice.  which is the traditional way.    Later i found out that it is a Korean run restaurant.  So I must say that they should learn to make food the right way or rename it to fit their serving ways.  don't call something one thing and then serve it a different way  Then they asked me if I was japanese and I told them yes.  and asked if they wanted me to show them how to make it  the right way. and I paid for my uneaten food and left and went to mcdonald..",

We chose \" I Love My Ass\" Roll....delicious.  As my boyfriend was at a conference close by we had to reside in The Orleans Casino for the week...We were so sick of the bad food on site that we ventured further afield. A quick search on-line and we found this place a 5 min walk away. The in-house sushi restaurant in The Orleans is overpriced and not very good...How happy we were we found this place and so reasonable too. For those of you staying in The Orleans you are mad not to check this place out. I also commend Sushi 21 for their notice about fish sustainability...Bluefin Tuna will probably be extinct soon and they are actively promoting other varieties and not stocking Bluefin anymore. I'm not sure people really understand how much in peril the ocean fish stocks are. Hopefully Sushi 21 will raise awareness of this serious environmental issue.",

We were seated immediately, and got our drinks in a timely manner. Receiving our soup within 10 minutes and then our main course in 1 hour! Though upon receiving our meal it was over seasoned meat which is just too powering. The Sushi was adequate, and the calamari was appalling. Never have we ever been served sushi where an ant crawled out. After that my appetite was almost gone, but I had not eaten the whole day so I still went to eat my main course. Next the calamari looked like onion rings, and the taste and texture was the most bizarre feel and taste of calamari I had ever experienced; as it was extremely stretchy sort of like trying to eat gum. Arriving at 8:01 and recieving our food at 9:30 it was the longest i have ever had to wait for food in my whole entire life! I hope they acknowledge this and address this issue. As for now I wont be coming back, and will not be recommending to anyone to the disgusting sushi, rubbery calamari, and extremely slow kitchen service!",

I was skeptical at first, when a lot of the baked rolls had cream cheese in them, but I asked the sushi chef what he recommended for something spicy and cooked, and we tried their Heart Attack Roll.... we watched him make it, and I was still doubtful, but once I had it, it was soooo good, with a spicy kick from their jalapeno. Their unagi was delicious, bulgogi lunch combo was great too, and it was really inexpensive, compared to what we'd been used to on the Vegas strip. They're open until 1am, and I kept that in mind in case I wanted to make another trip here before my trip back home.  Definitely will make it a point to stop here to grab a bite again. I only gave it 4 stars because I'm used to a more diverse menu of sushi rolls without cream cheese, but I'm inclined to try it again next time.",

As with most \"combo\" style dinners, you get soup, some salad, some California rolls, vegetable tempura, and the entree.  The salad was a small portion of iceberg lettuce with a splash of dressing.  The soup and tempura were average, but the tempura sauce really ruined the tempura.  It wasn't what I'm used to.  Kalbi was dry and really stringy.  Morale of the story: lots of variety with your combo dinner, except none of it was very good.",

The quality and temperature of the rice is the reason for the 2 star rating. The rice was cold and hard in every dish ordered...hand roll, nigiri, specialty roll, and crispy rice/spicy tuna.",

For me that ended 2 days ago.  I was there with a friend, he has been going to Sushi21 for 5 years. We both order the \"All You Can Eat\" as it usually saves us a few dollars. My friend ordered a roll he couldn't eat, they charged him $10 on top of his AYCE price.   Now I am not one of those people who expects discount because I have been going for years. I am however one of the people who continues to be loyal if the service is right and the food continues to be good.  This reflects a downgrade in service to me, and over the last 2 years the food has been going down.   Example: there have been dishes that where supposed to be served hot that came to our table, well chilly... Normally the waitresses would have your green tea filled without you even having to ask. Lately you have to constantly remind them.  I started going there as it was close, I kept going there for the service, food and value.   Now they have none.... Can't see going back, my friend either.  2 local customers lost.",

    "text": "This place was AMAZING! It may even be a new favourite for me in terms of AYCE on the West Side (I live in Green Valley area) because the quality is phenomenal without overdoing it on the rice side.  I always started out with seaweed salad and edamame. The salad was on the small side in terms of portion, but very sweet and delectable flavour so it did compensate. It leaves room for much more anyway! The edamame came out steaming which is great because nothing is worse than cold edamame as it tends to drop in temperature rapidly anyway.  Their menu has very unique items compared to most AYCE places. I tried the Screaming O Salad, which was three pieces of seared tuna with the sauce slathered over cabbage and lettuce. At first I expected it to taste bland due to the lack of colour but it was actually a very similar sauce compared to Ohjah's, which is a more expensive a la carte bistro in Summerlin- my only point of reference really. This was very close, and quite enjoyable for trying something new.  Their nigiri was just as comparable in quality to my favourite Henderson spot Sushiwa. The fish itself was a little smaller but at least not coupled with a snowball of rice and leaving you to order more. The salmon and tuna were both moist with flavour and I enjoyed the Pepper-Seared and Super White- both hit me with that va va voom melting effect.  BUT if you want melting- then you WANT to ordered their baked rolls. I suggest a half-roll so that you don't have to be wheeled out of the joint, and it works if you're sharing so that you can try more. The two rolls that blew my mind were the Baked Salmon and Baked Lobster. Absolutely delectable, especially Lobster for me.   At this point, if you're still open to another order before getting dessert, I suggest another half-roll of something fresh like Philadelphia per my friend's suggestion or perhaps another simple roll.   Despite bikini season approaching quite quickly, I knew I needed to experience their Deep-Fried Oreo. It was the first I'd seen in the desserts section of an AYCE before and it came out with a beautiful dollop of whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles, and deep fried chocolate. My waistline was happy it was only the size of 2 oreo cookies but my stomach was a little sad not to have more because the rich chocolate complemented the entire meal. Don't expect it to be creamy like the cookie though, and it's no complaint from me because I have a slight allergic reaction to anything too thick or frosty hitting my throat (no innuendo pun intended).  WILL DEFINITELY BE HERE AGAIN! :)",

    "text": "We are visiting vegas for the evening and had some time to kill for a sit down dinner.  We are from out of state and HATE the business of the strip and casino restaurants. This place was easy to get to and had plenty of parking. A serious plus in our book! We were seated and immediately brought our drinks. The waiter took around 10 minutes to make it around to our table but my food came out within 5 minutes of ordering!! So quick!  I ordered the gyoza which came with a delicious dipping sauce. I wasn't hungry enough for the AYCE menu so I just got one roll. I chose the yum yum roll which was delicious! Super light and fresh. I ate the whole roll and appetizer and felt very satisfied.   My husband however was starving and chose the all you can eat option which was very reasonably priced at $26.95. (Each roll averages to about $11 dollars so this option made sense)  His order took a little longer to make, I had finished my whole meal before he got his. It would have been nice to maybe have at least one roll of his brought out with mine.  He chose the TNT, caterpillar, and the vegas lasagna roll.   The service was great overall, our waiter was attentive and checked back to let my husband know his rolls would be out soon. Sure enough they were brought within 3 minutes.    The atmosphere is laid back and casual. We appreciated this after a long day of driving.   The price point was good; the AYCE made up for the lack of the \"half price sushi\" option. The restaurant was pretty spacious so it wasn't too loud. LOTS of booths.   All in all it was a perfect stop on our way through the city. Will definitely recommend and return!",

    "text": "I definitely feel like this place has declined since my last visit. I think the higher star ratings were so that people could take advantage of the check in deal, 10% off the bill if you show them your review on Yelp. Seems a bit fishy (haha) if you ask me.   The reason why I came here was because I was craving a bento box. I chose the teriyaki chicken box and added a Japanese lasagna roll. The roll came out first, and it was meh. Japanese lasagna is my go-to roll at any sushi place. Many places fail to make it to my liking, this happened to be one of those places. Oh, before I go on, I ordered the iced green tea which sounded delicious and refreshing, but it tasted like fishy rice! Seriously, it tasted like a sushi roll. I thought I was trippin, but after a few sips I had to give it back. I quickly exchanged it for water and they told me they would take it off my tab which was nice. By the way my server was very nice and checked on me often, so I have no complaints about the service.  Anyway the bento box is huge and you won't leave hungry. It comes with your entree (teriyaki chicken) with veggies, rice, 4 pieces of a California roll, salad, and veggie tempura. Everything was just okay, I didn't care for the dressing on the salad, and I didn't care for the teriyaki sauce that came with the chicken. I like the tempura veggies, zucchini and sweet potato, yum! And the Cali roll was pretty good also. I just don't see myself running back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "We were looking for a restaurant open on Christmas Day. Sushi 21 was, and not only that, they were running a promotion for AYCE sushi: $10 for dinner for writing a Yelp review. Best deal ever!  As with a typical AYCE sushi place, they make the sushi on demand. They have a huge assortment of rolls, a subset of the traditional nigiri, and some other (mostly Korean) appetizers: bulgogi, ramen, and spicy pork.  Part of this was an ordering error on our part, but most of the rolls ended up tasting the same despite having different sauces. The rice had a strange texture, probably an artifact of mass production. The fish was fresh but medium quality and sliced thinner than a traditional sushi restaurant would slice it.  On the up side, the servers were very prompt and friendly. They used preprinted sheets to take your order (like a dim sum place). Strangely they ran out of hot water to make tea but were able to heat some more in 10 minutes. Dishes were efficiently whisked away. One of the servers had a hard time understanding us and took plates we wanted to keep and didn't refill our tea when we asked.  All in all, we would be Grinch-like to complain about the super good deal we got. But if I were paying full price, I might try one of the more established players closer to the heart of Chinatown. So four stars for he Christmas special deal and maybe 3 stars if we were paying full price (as of Dec 2015, their prices were $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner).",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that this was my favorite sushi location up until last night. I just went a couple of weeks ago and had a great meal. I also told several friends to try this location.   Last night my friend and I were downtown and we were craving the lobster roll. She called Sushi 21 and asked for the hours for all you can eat. The man who answered the phone said that the AYCE was until 2 and the restaurant was open until 3. We got there right before 2. When we came in we were told that we can only order takeout. My friend explained that she had called and was told the restaurant was open until 3. We were not told we could only order take out. The guy said we didn't call and that he's the only one who answered. Once she showed him the outgoing call in her phone, he changed his story. He didn't try to accommodate and wasn't polite about it at all.   We ended up going up the street to another sushi spot. Sushi 21 lost out on the $70 that we paid for sushi and tip at the other location. More so, I just don't like people who lie so I won't continue to tell other people about Sushi 21.  The food is great which is the only reason I gave two stars. Customer service deserves negative stars.   Update: went back on 9/13 because I do like the food. My transaction was pending with my bank then disappeared. On 9/19, Sushi 21 charged me the actual $23 I approved plus an additional $23 duplicate transaction and both cleared the bank. That's one expensive all you can eat. I really wish people would learn how to do their jobs right.",

Sushi house is much better and worth the wait if you have patience. This place don't have a wait which is a plus. But in terms of sushi, it's decent at best. The Uni I got was suppose to be bright yellow. The ones I got was more like brown.... And it didn't taste fresh either. I order the \"something's wrong\" roll which describe having soft shell crab but when I got it, it was fake crab.... HUGE difference there buddy! I guess something was wrong! Not all was bad. Some of their other rolls are pretty decent. Don't get the mochi dessert. The dough has a funky texture.   Conclusion: I would not return unless I really crave for sushi and sushi house's waiting time is too long.",

Sushi 21 was just down Decatur and had a 4 star rating on here so we decided to try it.  This place is pretty good. The appetizers and rolls with AYCE are amongst the better places in town. The server we had was back very frequently to check on us and the sushi chefs were engaging. One of them even made me a half roll at the end of our meal even though they don't usually allow it when doing AYCE.   The only complaint that I had is when I ordered my first round of yellowtail, super white tuna, tuna, salmon, and unagi. It came out and looked very fresh but it smelled as if it were treated with something to preserve the fish. There was a slight taste of vinegar or something as well. I couldn't really place it. But the cuts were very generous and once past the \"treated smell / taste\" it had a good taste. I base my sushi experience pretty solely on the freshness / taste of the nigiri / sashimi so they're gonna take a hit on this one.  Overall, a nice substitute for my fave sushi place in town when I was on a tight time schedule. Not a place I'd visit again unless the same circumstances arise with better places close by.",

The second roll the fish did not seem fresh (my breath was kickin'). To top it off while finishing the last roll the chopsticks broke (not cool).   Note: We were the only people there and our food took forever and maybe that's why our rolls were soggy. To add on the service was not that great either.",

We sat down and ordered and the first thing I asked for was a side of yuzu sauce because I do not like/use soy sauce because of health reasons. They told me no that I couldn't have it because it's too expensive.  Too expensive I asked? Ok, so can you charge me for a side of it? They said no, but brought me a very small side of it, enough to dip three pieces of sushi in.  Not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray.  When I asked for more, they all of a sudden ran out.  We then ordered the yuzu yellowtail off the menu and lone behold more yuzu sauce appeared.  All of our sushi rolls came out, with the thinnest pieces of cut sushi I have personally ever had.  They were basically just rice rolls.  This is not what I call sushi. This restaurant should be called Rice Rolls 21 not Sushi 21. We should have just gone with our first Yelp review which was Sushi House Goyemon. They had awesome sushi and great service! Bummed we did not have a good experience.",

With that said Sushi 21 is pretty dang good. The eel was a little too soft for my liking, but everything else was spot on. The sushi chef was great. Even though the bar was full and he was in charge of the to-go orders our food was coming out faster then we can eat, and we eat fast.   The nigiri was fresh. The yellowtail came in big chunks. So yummy. The Salmon was real fresh too.   They have an extensive roll menu. LOVED the Jackpot. Nevada was good too. I even got the lobster roll. Its a California Roll with fried bits of lobster on top with eel sauce.",

    "text": "While there are a ton of AYCE sushi spots in Vegas, Sushi 21 is by far one of my favorites. They've got a pretty hefty menu of AYCE selections, so you aren't faced with too much repetition if you want to switch things up, and if you get bored with the menu, the chefs always have a little special item they can throw together for you.   My favorite specialty has seared salmon with kiwi - one of Kenny's awesome little creations. Just the thought of this delectable little dish makes me want to hop in the car and head over for an early dinner.   Meanwhile, if you're going to stick to the menu, I would suggest the popcorn lobster roll - somehow the sweet of the eel sauce and spicy mayo mix with the coolness of the California roll and the heat of the deep fried lobster bites to form the perfect symphony of greatness. Seriously. Try it.   Throw in a two for one deal on hot sake and you've got a pretty freakin amazing meal!",

Never coming back here again, even though I live down the street. Not worth it. I don't recommend.",

They're very accommodating (we have 2 small kids that come with us) and they make us feel so comfortable. Hip environment and friendly staff. But excellent sushi! If you are in the area and in the mood for some fish definitely stop by!",

The 2 most basic staples in a sushi restaurant is Tuna and Salmon and I could not express my level of disappointment in the Sushi, the Salmon wasn't the freshest or the highest quality so it tasted like bland slabs of meat along with the fact that there was too much vinegar was used in the rice.  The rolls on the other hand were flavored very well, but if you're trying to cover up the taste of bland fish, you're going to have to use the right sauce.  Overall this place forgivable, but I don't think I'll be plopping $68.00 (with tip) for 2 people for all you can eat of that quality.",

When the food finally did come, it came out of order, some items were even missed altogether, and sometimes we got food we didn't even order.   When we asked the servers about it, the answer was always about how the kitchen put out the food in whatever order they wanted.  The only redeeming quality was the owner came up and asked how the meal was. When we mentioned the servers didn't bring our items, she apologized and had those items brought out immediately.  I'm not sure what happened, but it just seems like the servers in this restaurant need a lot of training.",

    "text": "Coming from Colorado, we have maybe 2 options for all you can eat sushi, so visiting Vegas and being overwhelmed with options was very eye-opening!  We opted to go to Sushi 21 since it was close to our hotel and had good reviews (thanks, fellow Yelpers!). The price point seemed on-par with the competition as well. The restaurant itself isn't particularly fantastic when it comes to decor, but whatever, no worries. They were blasting some k-pop music which I found interesting and almost distracting since they were playing music videos on a giant projector right across from our table.  ON TO THE SUSHI. All you can eat sushi quality is never going to be as great as an expensive, a la carte sushi restaurant, so let's just get that out of the way. We were pleasantly surprised by the freshness of many of the selections including the salmon, white tuna, and yellowtail. We also ordered some of the sea urchin, clam, and raw sweet shrimp. The sweet shrimp was SUPER delicious, but the sea urchin was subpar (although I have definitely tasted worse uni at other establishments). Service was a little slow, but it was also a pretty slow night so I can understand why the servers might not have been fully alert.  It was a pretty great meal overall and we finished it with some tempura green tea ice cream and a deep-fried oreo, both of which were delicious, but it's hard to mess those things up.",

    "text": "My bf and I are from the Los Angeles area and frequent sushi restaurants at least a couple times a month. One of our favorites is Sugarfish, just to give you an idea of the quality we are used to. Sushi 21 has the staff and a cute location, but the chefs are definitely not what we had expected. The rolls were much smaller than at other restaurants and the tempura shrimp tasted as if it had been breaded with bread crumbs (!). It was strange to taste the albacore tuna with a liquidy garlic sauce on it and the eel was tasteless. The mussels were also covered in a clear liquidy garlic sauce rather than a spicy mayo mixture that normally accompanies baked mussels. My bfs rolls were smaller than he had preferred (philadelphia but the other I forgot) and he said that the quality was poorer than other sushi restaurants in the area.  The only reason I am leaving two stars is because the staff were courteous and the environment was pleasing, they also offer affordable ayce (but again, the quality of the food is lacking).",

There was no sashimi lunch offering and I ended up get the sashimi bronze dinner which came with 3 pieces each of tuna, albacore (which wasn't, it was escolar), salmon and yellow tail.   The fish was all fresh and decent size pieces. However it came with nothing else so I ordered a seaweed salad (over-dressed) and a miso soup which was pretty good.   The waitress was obviously new and didn't understand the menu or sushi in general but she was nice. Prices are okay-ish for Vegas.",

    "text": "I am a huge sushi fan. Since I've been a vegetarian it's hard to find places where they accommodate and craft rolls depending on what they have available. My low score does not have to do with the fact that they were less Jan accommodating to a paying guest. Though it may partly influence me a bit.   The restaurant itself is very clean, well lit and fittings for a few parties.   They have a larger variety of sushi rolls and if you're a sushi fan you'll love their all you can eat menu, and the different rolls.  Their dessert menu is limited to one dessert option per person which is somewhat standard as other places.  The main reason for my low review score was the bad customer service I experienced in this establishment. The servers were extremely rude and were less than helpful when helping me select menu items. Don't get me wrong I understand that it's a sushi place you have to eat fish, but they were less than pleased to serve me and made a paying customer feel like she was not desired at their establishment. Your experience may be completely different than mine but I'm not sure I'll be swinging by this joint again, specially with all the unlimited options in Vegas.",

We had salmon, yellowtail, red snapper and sweet shrimp nigiri. They were a perfect size for a big bite. We had fish, shrimp & vegetable tempuras, miso soup, cucumber salad, tuna poki. Udon baked green mussels and baked Lobster roll.   Favorites were the cucumber salad, fish tempura (yum), sweet shrimp, baked green mussel (sauce is great), and baked lobster roll.   The coolest thing is they have half rolls so you can try many things without being stuffed! Ok, we were super stuffed but enjoyed every bite and had ice cream to finish off. I had red bean ice cream and hubby had the tempura ice cream. Both were a great way to end a meal!  The sushi staff and servers were friendly and greeted us as we entered-very welcoming. We will definitely be back again!",

The Las Vegas roll was really good too. Very warm and yummy with balanced flavors. The Chicken Teriyaki Roll was just okay. It was good, but tasted exactly like you'd expect teriyaki chicken and rice to taste like. Didn't seem very \"sushi-like\" at all.   This is now my 10th time coming here. I've tried at least half their rolls and never had an issue. They just know how to make sushi right! There is never a wait time like at Goyemon Sushi down the street. All in all, it's a great place to go to if you want good food and fast service.",

They do require you eat all of your food including rice, but we had no problems with that. Everything was very good and tasted fresh. The nigiri was pretty small compared to what we're used to in the PNW - but when it's on the all you can eat menu - just order more :)   They also had a saki buy 1 get on 50% off style happy hour which included my husbands soju, so he was very happy about that. He said it was the absolute best soju he'd ever had.   We're in Vegas for a week and will definitely be back here before our trip concludes! YUM",

    "text": "AYCE Sushi for $26.99  Seems reasonable. I came in with a few of my Vegas resident friends for dinner before the night got started. It's just a few miles from the strip on Tropicana. For AYCE, you can pretty much order off the entire menu. Their special rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, still good. I had the salmon and white tuna sushi. It wasn't as fresh as I'd like it to be. Not that it wasn't fresh though. I just prefer it to be slightly colder when I bite into my sushi's. The ahi poke salad appetizer was good. Had a bit of a kick to it. People that enjoy spicy food may like that.  Service was decent. Although, our friends told us that the serve indicated we would receive a sake shot with ordering AYCE after 8pm. Well, we did not receive it. When we had asked the server, she said because it was busy they had to move the time to 9pm. Really? With at least 5 tables still empty and still plenty of chairs available for the bar area, that was busy? I don't think a small order of sake would make any difference in how busy a restaurant is. Because of that, they weren't a favorite in my opinion. We asked for separate checks, 3 bills. The bill for 2 people with gratuity included came out to be $72! They added $11 in gratuity. There was only 5 people dining. I always thought gratuity gets added on for a party of 6 or more, something 8 or more. I definitely wasn't pleased about it.  Paid my dues and left. I don't think I'll be making a stop here for sushi if I'm ever in the area.",

    "text": "A few hours of swimming at Temptations Pool Party at the Luxor, you work up an appetite. My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.  The service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.  The last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the \"mini beef platter\", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!  If. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!",

    "text": "The food was great. There is practically no wait. And there are a ton of options.  The deal breaker however and probably the reason why my friends and I will not be visiting this restaurant anytime in the future is the service.  Our first experience was very enjoyable our waiter was polite and attentive, but today when we went our waiter seemed distant and apathetic. When we attempted to make our second order, we had the all you can eat sushi, he informed us that last order time had past. He never informed us or warned us of a last order time. We wanted to end the meal with a bit of ice cream but were denied. The real problem came when it was time to pay. We were paying the bill half and half on two debit cards. He swiped one and said it declined. There was money in it we checked before and after leaving the restaurant. We just wanted to leave though so we paid full on the other card. It said decline again but this time we refused to believe him and asked to swipe again. The payment went through.  However after that ordeal.  When we later checked our bank statements. Both accounts had been charged half the total and one card charged a second time the full total. We called the restaurant to inquire about the fees the only response we received was \"we are closed.\"",

The part I cannot get over is when I watched the waitress sneeze all over a menu. She then proceeded to put the menu into the stand without cleaning it. After that, she wiped her nose on the back of her hand three different times without washing her hands. I watched her do that and then pick up my food from the sushi chef. In all of my life I have not seen this before. This is why people get sick. I recommend you eat somewhere else.",

This place is awesome.    Fresh fish, imaginative menu items, and friendly service.  A totally solid, surprisingly high quality spot to get FRESH sushi in the middle of the desert - at a REASONABLE price!  ;)  The ONLY reason I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the menus and table were kinda grimy/sticky.  Not really dirty - just seemed like maybe the sanitizer solution was a little old or heavy when the tables and menus were wiped so they weren't dry and were getting a little filmy.  I would only take half a star off for it if I could - it was a little ambiance lowering and kind of made me leery about how the food would be - but it was great!    Would definitely want to come back on a return trip to Vegas.",

The only one I didn't care for as much I don't remember the name of.  The service was excellent and delivery was very fast!  The Strawberry tempura ice cream was sooo good!  The atmosphere is quite pleasant and nicely lit.

    "text": "I always like trying a new all you can eat sushi place especially when it's so close by a very popular one like goyemon.  So I figured let's see if they're giving goyemon a run for their money.  HAHAHAHAHA not even close.  Tuesday night, 6 pm and there were 3 people in there, and no one else came in there the hour that I was there.  That's a BAAAAAD sign.  Typically tuesday is when sushi restaurants get their fresh fish and deliveries. If I recall, the fish markets are closed on mondays and there are no shipments.  So Tuesday & Wednesdays are the best days to go.    Without even asking, they brought me edamame and miso soup.  I don't particularly care for when someone brings me something that I didn't order.  Their miso soup was lacking flavor and only had 2 spoonfulls, their edamame was fine.  On an all you can eat place, portions should be small-medium.  I ordered the sashimi salad and it was in a large bowl (toooo much) and the taste was just ok, it tasted like they put their garlic sauce that they put on their sushi rolls, onto their salad.  Maybe some people like this, but I sure didn't.  Their sushi rolls were avg. I saw lots of rolls on their menu that were based on california rolls and to me that is a sign of cheapness.  Another typical bad sign is when you can't order directly from the chef. They use the paper order forms and quite frankly I HATE the paper order forms.    I ordered 2 sushi rolls and they were just ok  and then I ordered some nigiri and this sealed the deal that this place is bad...  I ordered 2 hamachi and 1 super white (both were good) I ordered 1 order each of snow crab, uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp)  I didn't get any of those orders. The show crab was still frozen (I saw him put the large frozen block of it into the fridge behind the counter), and then he apologized they are out of uni and sweet shrimp.  Guess what folks...  Sushi mon and Goyemon are never out of it.  and that leads me back to what I wrote above. Everything is usually fresh/delivered on tuesdays.  So where's your fish at?????   Sorry but for being 2 min up the street from goyemon (even if their servers are slow, the food is fantastic) I'm goin there instead",

I will never go back because raw fish sitting out cannot be healthy!  Having said that, some people question these AYCE Sushi joints for the same thing, and I have seen some things that were not good. But I see things wrapped that aren't being used, food kept at excellent temperatures, and nothing is ever left out!  I have walked out of another place and left my stamp card behind to tell them I would NOT be returning. As a cabbie who actually cares about my riders,  and who happens to be a \"non-Strip\" food fanatic,  and who happens to be rather large,  I like taking guests to food havens and looking at the faces of full and happy customers.  21 does it very well. The fact that it's not in Chinatown makes it an easier drive (J/K). You can also have sashimi   at dinner.  BTW if you need a driver that 1. Speaks English 2. Is 100% Honest 100% of the time.  3. Has a personality and is funny.  4. Knows a lot about this crazy town (history and food. I may not know ALL the clubs because they change almost weekly ) 5. My #1 concern is the safety of my customers.  Both on the road and in situations where people get ripped off.  Vegas is a fun place but some people target good people who may make drunken choices.  Let me help you stay safe.",

I think that defeats the purpose of appreciating the taste of sushi.  I had started out with the Edemame and Soft Shell Crab.  An awesome choice as the crab was cooked just perfectly.  The sauce they combine it with is perfect.  The Edemame is good for two people.  One person couldn't eat all that unless they were eating for two.  I only had one roll of sushi called Route 21.  I forgot what was inside it, but I would order it again when I come back.  It didn't even need any wasabi or soy sauce or ginger for that matter.    Service was great especially from the Sushi Chefs.  The ladies are very prompt with the drinks and what ever it is you need.  The food is prepared perfectly.

While this isn't the best sushi around, it is still of good quality and reasonably priced, and I've yet to have a disappointing meal.   I normally get either the chirashi sushi or its Korean equivalent, hye dup bap (I believe this place is Korean owned and operated), each of which is a great deal for around $12 (though they charge an extra $2.50 for miso soup, which typically comes with chirashi at most places).",

The fish quality was good the salmon was fatty and the hamachi had great flavor and texture.   But the main problem I had was the rice. The rice is the most important counterpart to sushi and the rice here had no flavor. The more I ate the more I couldn't get over this.   Finally, the fried food was over battered and hard to eat.",

The drinks unfortunately were not replinished until 30mins later after asking for a refill. Maby they just don't give goood service to guys with muscle,  it's not like it was busy at all I don't get it I will try this again with my girl maby we will get better  service. They do have good food and they did say thanks you and good bye on the way out so I will give them 2 stars. Smh",

Cons: Disgustingly over-sauced rolls BS rules around AYCE - 1 hour limit, no sashimi, etc. Piss-poor sushi rice  Pros: Fish quality was actually okay Yung, our server, was very nice AYCE mochi!  Sushi 21 is the antithesis of what good sushi is all about - fresh, balanced, natural deliciousness.  The rolls were so poorly made, in a clear attempt to fill you up on bad sushi rice and rich sauces.  A travesty....",

The towels they gave us were dirty and I wish they gave us napkins instead. The counter tops smelled liked dirty rags and we're extremely sticky, made me feel like the place was a bit unsanitary. While I was eating, there was a spider crawling around my table and freaked me out, making me lose my appetite. For appetizer, the Miso Soup is not too bad and the Golden Spoon is an interesting dish to try, but the Garden Salad was so tasteless and the greens weren't fresh. The raw sushi was decent in quality and freshness, my only critique is that the fish on nigiri was sliced too thin so it didn't satisfy me. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) was actual really big in size compared to other restaurants and they at least serve Giant Clam, which many sushi restaurants having been serving lately. The Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) Nigiri was not made well, it was extremely cold when it's supposed to be warm, it was drenched in eel sauce, and there was a lot of rice. There were three people doing sushi at the bar and the sushi that came from the main chef was more impressive than the sushi made by the other two chefs who looked like young teenagers. At the end of my meal, I got to have Mochi Ice Cream which at least didn't disappoint me and actually satisfied my taste buds. I was not impressed by this restaurant, it was not worth the $26.99 for AYCE. The restaurant looks nice but the quality of food didn't live up to the name.",

First he said 1/2 off from$26.95 but then 5mins later the waiter came back and told us that my son will be a full price. It seems that they don't know how to run a precessional business at all.

Anyways ! The all you can eat sushi is like $26 a person and we were kinda iffy on it but then we took that gamble and the food quality was not as good as I hoped ): we were supposed to go to goyemon but the wait was literally an hour so we decided to go to sushi 21 since it was near by . We walked in and the restaurant was basically empty and so we sit and the waitress took our order . They forgot my baked mussels a couple of times that I asked and did I mention the quality of the food wasn't that good ? Idk it might be just me coming from Hawaii (with some of the freshest yummiest fish) to Vegas with some crappy not as fresh  quality fish but yeah the mussels tasted like over cooked really hard chewy mussles with some really bold sauce to cover it up . And the miso soup was SOO salty omg my mother couldn't even finish it because she said it was waaaay too salty for her . But the spicy poki was actually kinda good only cuz it was really spicy but to also add the fish was still extra chewy bleh . We also ordered a yum yum roll and that was pretty bland not as \"yum yum\" as I expected . The wonton soup though is good I'd recommend but the portion is SOO little you'll probably finish it in a couple of bites . Overall I wish I dined at goyemon tonight instead but it's always good to try new places and I can't say it was completely disgusting since it did fill me up so 2 stars because the customer service wasn't terrible but only 2 stars because $26 for a person for such low quality food is not agreeable to my standards",

    "text": "I know that for all-you-can-eat sushi you have to eat all the rice or get charged for it, but do you have to eat all the fish? ;)  1.5 stars. I usually round up but here I'm rounding down for the dishonesty of their check-in scam.  We were craving sushi around 1am and this was the only AYCE we saw that was open past 2am.  Service was friendly and not inattentive though that may have had to do with the fact that we were the only ones there at 1am (despite their supposedly closing at 3am).  Last call is posted in the window as 2:15 but when we sat down we were informed last call was at 1:45am. Did not contest the sign on the door. Maybe they changed their hours, but if that is the case then they needed to also change their signs.  The sushi rice was too sweet.  Fish across the board was not very fresh.  Uni was not great. The brighter the color, the better. Pale or brown uni has either a plasticky or seaweedy (and not in a good way) taste to it. These were pretty brown, but surprisingly not as awful as at JJANGA or Goyemon.  Oysters were far from the worst I'd ever had, but the freshness of a raw seafood item is still worryingly called into question when you feel the need to put lemon slices directly on it.  Snow crab was so cloyingly sweet it was sweeter than the shaved ice we had at Chada St on Tuesday. It did not taste like crab at all, real *or* fake.  We asked for no sauce on anything but they only remembered to not put sauce on our shrimp tempura roll, which had surprise \"krab\" (fake crab) in it.  Which brings me to the rolls. Rolls on the special, baked, and fried rolls lists (basically everything that was not on the traditional roll list) were not very varied. Almost everything had fake crab in it even if it was not a listed ingredient. Everything that didn't have krab had spicy tuna and everything that didn't have spicy tuna had krab.  We ended up only getting a couple rolls because after they couldn't get \"no sauce\"\" right we were not confident they would be able to do \"no crab\" reliably and did not want to fill our stomachs with that sweet crud.  Disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could still have green tea ice cream and still have tempura and not have tempura green tea ice cream (I had horrific thoughts of soggy, pre-tempura'd ice cream dancing rudely in my head, but the DH informed me that they have to super-freeze a ball of ice cream in order to tempura it without it melting, and that this takes 2 hours or more, so apparently that's how).  Don't like the scam they're running for the check-in discount. Have encountered the whole \"write good review for a discount\" scam before, but never seen it attached to a check-in, or seen a place where they want the review up front. Makes no sense.",

I can't imagine they would enjoy eating what they serve!!!!  Why do they get such good rating you ask?  Because they offer 10% off when checkin at yelp and write a review.    The only reason they stay opened is because of the overflow from another better AYCE sushi nearby.  Service was great nevertheless, but don't come here, go get a burger instead!",

My sister in law was craving sushi and found this spot. It was about $26.95 all you can eat. But if you order too much and don't finish, you'll be charged extra. I wish I could eat $27 worth of food but I have a tiny appetite..so hubby and his brother ate more than enough to cover me.. Food was good, but ever since my proposal at Yellow Tail in the Bellagio, no sushi or Japanese dish will ever come close to the best meal I had over there.. On that note, this sushi joint wasn't all that bad. I enjoyed trying out new dishes and sushi rolls. Although the food was served a little slower because they were busy..but overall, it's a great spot to try out. Some of what we ordered was spicy garlic Edamame, miso soup, my first time trying eel Brown dragon roll, and baked mussel.",

The tempura was decent however it was super greasy and there were some pieces missing. The avo rolls were beautifully sized -like the best I've ever seen and the avocado was nicely ripened not over ripe. My sister had the seaweed salad and gave it great reviews. Lastly the spicy garlic edemame was nicely seasoned with the right amount of spice. One thing I'd like to see improve with this company is their takeout order presentation. Since it was a takeout order I would've loved if they packed empty plastic ramekins so we could pour the soy sauce into it. I had also asked for extra wasabi as part of the order but they gave us the tiniest amount  complete opposite of what I asked for. All in all this was not the best but it did suffice. With so many sushi spots in the area it's hard to be the best.",

My friend and I had such a bad experience we didn't even care about not getting the rolls we wanted to leave. We wanted to be there 1 hour ended up being two because of how long we waited for everything. The worst part is that before we left an older women who was working there or helping out cane up and started touching her hair out of nowhere without asking in the middle of us eating then had the nerve to tell us to rate them high on yelp. So disappointing since it was my absolutely favorite place. Never again",

Yum Then order a few traditional sushi pieces ( I stick to yellowtail, red snapper, and of course salmon) Yum again Then hit the rolls... I love spicy, so most of my selections come hot! My favorites thus far are the kamikaze, ugly, and the double yellowtail... Oh order 1/2 rolls so you can try even more of their variety. They have over 100 rolls to pick from!  Now, remember....it's an AYCE sushi place so don't expect Top Grade fish... it's not Jiro's place... but  it is still pretty good... with that being said. Hope you enjoy the grub.  Oh... service is good too! No complaints other than the fact that I asked for a miso three different times and it was never brought out... but meh.",

The food was really good but the reason I gave it 4 stars because of the weird vibe service we got...   Me and my friend went went there on a Monday evening, there was no other customers there when we arrived. We got seated at the booth next to the cashier, the waiter immediately asked if it was my first time here and I said yes then he gave me the ayce menu, just right after I got the menu, the waitress was standing next to him immediately asked if we wanted to put in kitchen order?!? I just said it was my FIRST TIME here. I didn't even have 5 secs to look at the menu. We ordered our food and it came out very quickly. And while we're eating, the same waitress was standing like 2 steps away from our table and kept staring at our table almost the whole time.... I felt like I was being watched  but other than that. The whole experience was great. Will be back when I'm in the area!",

I would definitely rate this place a 100 start, because the owner came up to me to offer holding my baby while I eat. Who does that? Amazing!!! Every time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be back.

Ala Carte is also available if you are not that hungry reasonably priced.   The Lunch Bento specials are a great value and very generous in portion size.    Verdict: AYCE is a good value if you're pretty hungry. The sushi is fresh and good portions.  Large variety of items that you can choose from in the menu including premium rolls that are priced normally between 10-14$. Remember no wasting and no sharing on the AYCE. The tempura and sushi was very good. Large restaurant able to fit larger parties. Good value and don't forget 10% yelp check in discount.",

Just hearing the cute server say the name of that one was enough reason to order it, but it tasted really great too.  The prices were reasonable with most full size rolls between 9 and 13 dollars.

Sushi 21 does not have exotic fish, but it has all the basics, including my favorites (uni, sweet shrimp, spicy tuna, salmon, salmon roe, yellowtail, etc). It is casual/low-key so it may not be your romantic first-date place, but it's your staple where you go to get fresh sushi and great service at a good price...  i really loved the \"I LOVE MY ASS\" roll...

We did the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of different items and every one of them was really bad. Nothing is made fresh. Everything is frozen and the result is no flavor, awkward unpleasant textures and very poor quality. Presentation was also weird. Even the pickled ginger was flavorless and harsh to eat. I can't think of anything positive about the experience and I felt like my money was completely wasted. It was completely empty which should have been our first sign to walk right out before even sitting down. I can't believe it is still in business. It makes me never want to stray away from Kaya again which does almost everything well.",

So we drive all the way over there only to be told 1) I didn't really call there (the rude guy at door even made me show him my phone that I called there) and 2) they only serve take out. It was 138am. Guy was so damn rude, they have lost a few customers in me and my friends. I'll never be back. Don't say one thing and do differently when you have customers. There were two of us, we knew what we wanted before we sat down because we frequent this place.... never again will I step foot into this place or recommend it to ANYONE!

Instead we opted for Sushi 21. My boyfriend has been here before but my best friend and I haven't.   Their AYCE sushi price is the usual price of $21 for lunch and $27 for dinner but for $10 extra, they also include an all you can drink for hot sake and beer. I haven't heard of any sushi joint doing all you can drink before! It was pretty cool. Their special rolls were alright. Nothing I tried really wow'd me so far but it wasn't bad either. That all you can drink menu though, is worth coming here!",

The uni was a brown pasty color that resembled beef, opposed to the bright yellow/orange. The chef claimed that the uni was bought that morning and can provide a receipt. The chef stated that the uni was brown due to \"the wind,\" aka oxidation.   The servers were nice and I was super impressed with their memory! They retained all of our orders verbally and did not take any notes.   The AYCE was about $27/person.",

I ordered the oysters and if ya like dirt, she'll, and yet again a fishy tang then by all means get them. When I order oysters I want the ocean and the texture. The edamame was probably the only thing they got right.  I forgot what my friends ate but they said the tempura was not good and didn't like the carrots. They got my receipt right but messed my friends up twice! The first time they charged them what I ordered, then they charged them twice for something they only ordered one of.  They were not busy at all. Also if you live in Vegas I'm visiting from San Francisco so my sushi standards might be higher but this isn't a place I'd go back to not for the price they charge for mediocre sushi.",

The Mussels are absolutely delicious. They give you five pieces which is a pretty great value.   **The Dynamite scallops were tasty as well. The MGM roll was big and topped with a huge pile of spicy tuna, it comes with a yummy dipping sauce. **The best thing about this whole order was the restaurant gave me a free roll on the house. I believe it was Spicy Tuna and Spicy Tuna is my favorite(Top 1).  Thank you!! It was such an awesome suprise!!  **I will definitely order from here again!!!",

Located off the strip not far from Chinatown off of Decatur. In a strip mall.  The place isn't that big. There's a good about of tables and the sushi bar is right when you walk in.   The menu offers plenty of rolls to choose from as well as classic sushi. And as stated, All You Can Eat. Heads up, it does get busy so place your order on what you want so you can start from there. I ordered a good amount starting off. Incase it got busy and the it may take too long till the next order. Just like every place that offers this, if you leave any leftover you will be charge. So order accordingly. As long as you start with a good amount, you can just go from there. Downfall, the sushi was a tad small compare to other places I've been too. Price is great for lunch and dinner.",

They only use the more common fish (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, etc), no eel, scallop, octopus, etc. but I liked how the ikura was served in an avocado bowl. Price is comparable to others, but did not include soup. Staff were polite and prompt.   TIPS: You can place online orders with the Yelp app, extensive AYCE menu more popular than a la carte here.

The thing is that sushi shouldn't have a \"fishy\" flavor.   All in all, it was good. Good presentation as we for each plate! I'll definitely visit again but I'd want to try the others.  Oh and one thing also. The customer service was a bit wonky for me.

    "text": "So I was craving sushi for lunch again and, as usual, my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I prefer AYCE sushi spots that allow half-size rolls because I enjoy trying a lot of the variety, and it's a better price value than a la carte whether you're dining solo or sharing the experience. Sushi 21's menu offers a fantastic assortment of sushi and appetizers that easily satisfied my appetite.   It wasn't busy inside since it was late afternoon on a week day, but that didn't affect the high quality of sushi and service I received from the staff. I chose to sit at a table because of the comfy booth seats, and I actually had two friendly servers checking on me every few minutes to make sure I was happy with my food. I didn't feel like I was being hounded by them at all because they kept a short distance away unless I needed my empty plates removed or my water refilled. I appreciated the casual and relaxed atmosphere where you can feel at ease even when you're the only diner in the room.    The talented chefs prepared my orders in a timely manner, and I was pretty much gobbling all the deliciousness down as my items came. I had forgotten to mark the Dynamite as a half size, and I didn't realize how full my stomach was feeling until I saw that the plate had eight sushi rolls underneath the topping instead of four! It was my last order too, and I really should've stopped, except that my digestion hadn't caught up with my brain until it was too late. I don't like wasting food, and I told the server that I'd pay for the remaining uneaten Dynamite. They were kind enough to just let me take it home without extra charge since I did still manage to at least finish half of it (despite the pitiful protesting of my nearly exploding belly). ;p  Anyway, this was what I ate (my appetizers arrived first and sushi later): Baked mussels- (3 pieces) light and flavorful! Crab pockets (2 pieces)- fried cream cheese and crab rangoons Shrimp Tempura- (3 pieces) delightfully crispy Cucumber salad- sweet and vinegary Alligator roll- deep fried eel on top, crab inside Baked Lobster roll- lobster salad mix on top Dynamite roll- corn, scallops, mushrooms, crab mix  It didn't seem like a lot at first -- until I started eating. The amount of sushi rice was minimal, so I was really getting full from the substantial portions of the other ingredients. I wish I could train my stomach to hold more food, but I'm definitely coming back to gorge myself on the rest of Sushi 21's menu! :D",

    "text": "I was super excited to go to another ayce sushi place in Vegas! I know they have the best variety for your dollar too. I'm deducting two stars for some mishaps however.   Food was good! Amazingly good. The sauces. The fish. The variety. The waiter forgot to hand us back our sheet with what we ordered sooo I'm sorry I can't remember the names of the rolls we ordered :( my favorite had salmon on top. Inside was crab and shrimp tempura. ) I'm assuming maybe the waiter did not bring back the paper because he thought we were done eating. But you should still always bring it back after each round just in case.    We actually ordered other rolls but got full and told the waiter to cancel the upcoming rolls.  He said sure but one roll still came to our table from a different waitress.. I felt bad to tell them to please take it back and reminded them our other rolls were canceled...   Also they have typos on their menu which is frustrating. It wasn't until after I finished eating that I saw the correction at the bottom of the menu \"rolls that say 6pcs are actually 8pcs but you can ask for half roll of 4pcs\". UGH why why why didn't I see that sooner???????? I would've tried way more rolls in half quantity and not been confused why I have 8 instead of 6 ... please just get new menus and fix them. Don't do a little note. It's just lazy. Or atleast put that Little note at the top of the menu where people are more likely to see it.   The menu to order gives you only 2 rounds. Most places give you 3. Also, there's no section for appetizers and desserts to check what you want. There's a memo section in the back so that helps I guess.   There must not be much communication happening because two diff waiters came to us and we reminded them we've been waiting for our shrimp tempura for awhile. Our wonton soup never came so we didn't even mention it. And we ended up getting two plates of the tempura :/ plus it's an appetizer so it was kinda pointless eating it at the end of our meal but oh well. We overheard another table asking for the same thing so it wasn't just us.   If the service could be a little better, that would make this a definite 5 stars. The food was great. I just had a few disappointments.",

Since living here we have been unable to find one.   Anyway, service was perfect and our server was very efficient and kind and full of smiles. Clean inside and let us get to the food.  We ordered 4 rolls and appetizers. One of appetizers we order was muscles. They were dripping with garlic butter/sauce perfectly cooked not dry not swishy.   Then we ordered some rolls. Spicy crab some sushi (crab eel etc) and the sauces they used on some of the rolls really added some extra tastes of happiness to each roll. We ordered an orange blossom. It came with a light creamy garlic sauce. My only complaint although every good. I personally would have wanted it slightly warm. The rolls were not rolled really tight and often came apart when eating. The only things i would have change personally. But have no fear not tightly rolled sushi and chilled garlic sauce on my orange blossom doesn't change a thing. It was a great Resturant. Highly recommend. So forgive my spelling errors and context. I wanted to do this review before my sushi wears off. My glasses are not my usual pair as well.",

But tonight I wanted to try something new. Mind you, it's always really good here. But tonight I don't know what was happening. She ended up just getting her jacket on and walking out after handing us our first messed up roll.   Now I know you're wondering why this is a 5 star review. Well, the waitress and the guy (Jeff) afterwards completely fixed everything and they were so nice and friendly. They completely made the night and the food started coming out great. THATS the sushi 21 I know. So big thanks to Jeff and the sweet lady afterwards. You guys are really appreciated.",

The service was not inviting, the fish was dry and looked like it was sitting out all day. The salmon wasn't fresh. It tasted almost rotten. The rice was dry and had a salty after taste. It was so bad that even the dessert was horrible.  The green tea ice cream tasted artificial.  For the all you can eat option, well they made it uncomfortable to order by reminding us that they charge for leftovers.  This is not our first rodeo and we are very aware of that common policy for all u can eat sushi.  I guess im glad he did warn us because the food was appallingly disgusting.  Im not sure I would have finished my orders. Im sticking with Goyemon or Kaya. This place isnt worth the time and money.",

Kenny's always joking, and John loves to party!!  We always do the AYCE, and on fridays and saturdays they do free sake bombs! Err..well sometimes they forget but I'm not really gonna freak out about it, it's FREE. The table service is pretty inconsistent though. I have had AMAZING service (and make sure to let them know with a tip they did well) and then I've had some pretty awful service as well (sitting on an empty drink for 20 minutes, stacks of empty plates waiting to be taken away. I've even seen the chefs having to remind the waitresses to get the food and bring it to the table.) Soo....I gotta knock a star off for that. But I gotta say...as a loyal customer these guys treat us great. From random, \"Just try this, don't eat it if you don't like it\" rolls, to great recommendations on the AYCE menu. Never had a bad experience with the freshness or quality of the food sooo...not sure what some of the other reviews are talking about. :-\\  Advice? Be good to the chefs. If you take care of them, they'll take care of you.",

There is a reason why they are never that busy. I will never come back even if the food was free.  Terrible terrible terrible place.

After we were done paying, the same chef followed us all the way to the door and started yelling in his own language and started throwing salt all around us. I know in some Asian countries they use salt for purification purpose, and therefore by throwing the salt around us he was treating us as \"bad luck.\" I would be surprised if he still works there because no one would want to hire such a rude crazy chef like him.",

The waitress gave us the menu and I put in a first order of a roll in their menu. The guy behind the bar just stared at me and said okay. He has another chef make it, Johnny, and when he hands it to me he said its not included in AYCE. I looked at the other guy and said \"I wish someone had told me.\" But I said I'll take the charge.  In my sushi rolls I like cream cheese, avacado, salmon or yellowtail. Our new chef now, Johnny, asked me what I like and I told him. He surprised us with sushi rolls and this roll with mushrooms and cream cheese and they were all really good! His great customer service made up for everything. And when we got our bill he had told the waitress to take that roll off that wasn't included on AYCE.  I will only come back now because of his great customer service and the rolls are amazing.",

Prices are terrible!!!  Don't go!!  There was seven of us that night. My friends was there first and told them that we wanted AYCE. I arrived 10 minutes later. We told them again. another 10 minutes later, we had to tell them one more times that we want AYCE. Finally 20 minutes later, this girl took the regular menu away and threw this paper to us and said \"just check mark next to the items we want\".   Ok, I guess it's self service.  We decided not to order too much sushi and everything we order was going to be 7 orders for each one of us. We gotten each order of sushi every 5 minutes. (You have to understand that one order of sushi is two bites, two bites every 5 minutes is annoying)   Half way through our orders, this rude younger girl came around again and asked us if we wanted anything else. We told her that we never got the rest of first round. She told us \"just wait\" and \"it's coming\". Ok....so we ordered a little more.  10 minutes later, we got all of the second round(salmom, yellowtail, and eel for the second time), but still........ half of the first round was not here.   Most of the first round items are the expensive items. Spider hand roll, sea urchin(uni), sweet shrimp , makerel (saba) and snow crab.   10 minutes went by again, no first round. We asked and got the same answer. Then we decided to order shrimp tempura. And we got \"fried shrimp\". Very disappointing. The \"fried shrimp\" was breaded with PANKO. This is just unbelievable.  After the shrimp disaster, we asked again about our first order. The rude girl finally tried to ask us what they were. By this time, it's almost one hour since we arrived. The kicker of the night is she elected to tell us that she is worried that we won't be able to finish and they are only going to give us the first round orders one at a time.  This is just MADNESS.  At the end, of course we did not get all of the food we want. We were too angry to deal with them, and we did not want them to spoil the night even futher.   Of course they charged us mandatory 18% tip on the check after the sales tax.   Of course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included.   And of course nobody said \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\" to us after we just spent almost $40 a person for the wrost sushi ever.",

The inside is kind of pop-Japanese style with traditional elements mixed with LCD screens playing Japanese boy-band videos the whole time. A cool distraction. I've mostly eaten here in the middle of the day, as opposed to the evening.   None of the rolls really stand out in my mind, service is a little bit slow some night. The AYCE has a good sized menu, and some tasty standard treats, but for the price I have been to other places with Free Saki & Beer for almost the same price.   Whenever I go for lunch I like the Bento Box the best. It's got a little bit of everything on it, Gyoza, Rice, Teriyaki Chicken, a Salad, Miso soup and 6 pcs of california rolls. Not bad.   I also enjoy the Shirmp Tempura and Calamari at this location.   I've never had a bad experience at Sushi 21 like some of the other reviewers, but it has a long way to go to beat out other AYCE's scattered around Las Vegas.",

It was slow when I came in and they had already been sat service was prompt and the nigiri came out quickly as is to be expected of simple dishes. Rolls came out fast and were good the SWAT was my favorite since I'm a shrimp lover. Our friends grabbed single menu items and we both did AYCE which was alright up until our friends had to leave. The server brought everyone's check even though we weren't finished eating which wasn't a big deal at all until our server started not coming to our table. We made eye contact with her multiple times and it still took her about 5 minutes to come by and check on us. She cleared our table as well without asking if we had wanted anything else (hadn't even ordered our last rolls or dessert yet). She ended up coming back after seating a table behind us at which point we were 1 of four tables with two servers in the restaurant. When she asked if we wanted dessert we were relieved and put in our final order. The deep fried Oreo was amazing as was the mango mochi really all the dessert was good (we got 2 of each).  All in all good service at first that had a sheer cliff drop off after our friends. Sushi came out quickly but the nigiri was covered in some type of brown vinegar stuff that made it rather \"eh\". Rolls and dessert were great. More attentive service throughout the whole experience would've been nice instead of being placed into the \"I'm getting auto gratuity I don't need good service\" category. 3 star nigiri, 5 star rolls and dessert, 3 star service.",

Similar to places like Sushi Mon and Geoymon which is just down the street.  We ended up going to Sushi 21 since Geoymon had over an 1 hour wait for our party of 8 which is way too long when you have places to go and people to see.  However, they didn't have oysters which was a real bummer since it was on the menu and something we expected to slurp on.  Lindsey was our server and I must say the service was excellent.  Very prompt and friendly.  Her excellent service made us miss the oysters a little less.  A potential for 5 stars if they had oysters.",

My husband and I ate there Fri for dinner and enjoyed it so much that we decided to take our adult son, daughter and children for Easter late lunch and it was just as good. I don't eat raw fish and they have a large variety of baked and deep fried choices. All the raw rolls my son ordered were very fresh and he said were excellent. Every roll we all ordered were large. We are in Vegas for 1 week and plan to eat there again before leaving!  The service is fast and they cleared our empty plates very quickly as we would finish each roll. The AYCE is worth it for the price which includes lots of appetizers, about 100 roll choices, and dessert. They are conveniently located only about 3 blocks from our timeshare unit at Diamonds Resort so could walk there.",

We were told right after seating that the kitchen had already been closed for the night and ayce ended at 1:30am. Fine, we were just wanting a few rolls and some miso anyways. As we finished our first roll and were just working into our second we decided to order another just before 2am....SORRY CHARLIE, try doing that and you're S.O.L.! The sushi chef had already closed up everything. Thanks for the \"last call\" notice! Not that we should be surprised, the waitress wasn't even sure what was in our rolls when asked, she had to grab a menu! I thought server knowledge was a requirement in a restaurant... guess not here. The food was good but the service was lackluster bordering on crappy. And for being the only 2 ppl in the place, you'd expect a little more attention and service. Don't think we'll be returning here.",

We were headed to Goyemon and discovered the hostess was not friendly and the wait at 5:40 on a Friday night for a party 3 adults and 3 kids was going to be 1 1/2 hrs.  Seriously?  There was just one other couple waiting ahead of us.    We yelped the nearest sushi restaurant with 4 or more stars.  And turns out this was literally just around the corner.    - AYCE was $27 - Decent selection on the menu - Favs:  (rolls) Sexy girl, Heartache, Johnny, Snake (or rattle snake...snake is in the     name or something)  Anyway, we tried a lot of rolls and enjoyed them all but these were our favorites. - VERY kid friendly (customized kids chopsticks), owner brought out crayons and color pages, and topped it off with balloons. - Dessert:  MOCHI (strawberry) - delicious ice cream in the middle and a chewy sweet rice cake on the outside - Sake bombs on the house the night we went.  (Who doesn't like sake bombs, especially when they're on the house.) - Friendly and entertaining sushi chefs.   We honestly felt like we were truly welcomed and at home.  Food was good and personal customer service was excellent.  We have found another joint we'll be frequenting often.",

We drove by Goyemon but it looked too busy so we drove back to this spot.  Hunnie Bunnie got her Edamame and Japanese Udon Noodles which she enjoyed. This is what I ordered:  Baked Green Mussels - these were really good, whatever sauce/toppings they put on I really liked and they were served nice and warm.  Calamari rings - crispy breading and served with a spicy dipping sauce. Not bad at all.  Soft Shell Crab - small soft shell crab, split right in half. Good stuff. I love sscrab!  Lettuce Wraps - they were out of this item!!! I really wanted to try these cuz it involved pork belly :-( Next time!!  Tuna Poki Salad - this was aiight. I've definitely had better. It's some kind of different sauce they put on and I think the spiciness of the sauce overwhelms the flava  Screaming Orgasm - not enough sashimi but lots of daikon  Yellowtail Jalapeno - they put sriracha on the jalapenos. I usually LOVE sriracha but i didnt care for it on this dish. And i wasnt really a fan of the sauce they used for this sashimi plate.  Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna Nigiri - SO good! This fish tates SOOO fresh and melt in your mouth! Nicr size cut of fish and a small serving of rice accompanies it. REALLY REALLY GOOD! I had given up on AUCE sushi because the fish just didnt taste that good to me anymore but this place changed my mind!   Scallop: It's mixed with something, crab mix maybe, and not tasty at all.  Sweet Shrimp - I actually only ordered this so I could eat the fried shrimp heads. Nom. And to think I never ate them before... The shrimp itself wasnt very good but the heads were tasty!  Four stars for the fish. Three stars for the apps.",

When we finally got here I thought to myself \"oh it looks okay\" you can see the sushi bar right when you enter the restaurant. The staff were nice so okay we gave it a shot.   We sat down and they gave us a sheet of paper where in you have the list of most of the items except for appetizer and just check which you wanted. I thought it was cool but at your second order they never gave the list so eh..  So we're done for the first round but still have a few rolls on our plate (angus and chicken teriyaki roll which didn't taste so good for me ) and I wanted some more seaweed salad and other things so I called the waitress, before I could even speak she already opened her mouth and told me \"you do know that we charge if you have any left overs \" and she was looking down at my plate. As if we were done eating and trying to get the check but no we were still going to order and that kind off loss my appetite for a little bit, I obviously know your policy cause it's in the menu, and we wanted to order more and obviously we will finish all what we ordered because we didn't want to be charged.   I'm not sure if I will be going back here it just so happens that goyemon was too full, and there's nothing special about this place because what you get here you can get from other sushi places.",

    "text": "With all the fancy Vegas buffets and such my wife and I drive a little way off the strip to come here every time we visit Vegas.  To start the sushi quality and freshness is what earns my repeated visits. Originally recommended by a friend that also drives off the strip every visit to Vegas this has also become a place I highly recommend to visitors.  Coming for Los Angeles my choices for sushi is far and beyond. At $26.95 a person for dinner the price may be a little steep but they offer it back in value that can't be beaten with a few one per person orders like Giant Clam, Uni, sweet shrimp, Fresh Oysters, and a lot more.  The place features fusion sushi rolls and many creations by the sushi chefs here. Things like Cherry Blossom which features spicy soft shell crab wrapped in avacado are just delicacies to crave and earn the right for another visit!  If you are a green mussel fan, my wife and i order 5-6 orders of 2 pieces each every time we come lol... And it's sad you'd think you get better food in LA but this place has it done right!  There is also fusion of Korean delights such as galbi and bugolgi.  The decor of the place is very izakaya friendly. They even have an area where you purchase and bring your own chopsticks and they will wash them and place it a area dedicated for you to use when you visit.  Those of you that follow me know the amount of sushi I enjoy on a regular basis and this place has made it to my top 3 in value and variety of all time.  I highly recommend the place and encourage you to give a chance.",

    "text": "This is a big no for me. Part of the reason is because it's different \"system\" from the rest of AYCE and another part is the quality and selection is not that great. They are way too many sushi places here in Vegas to have to settle for \"ok\" sushi. Having said that, if you are the roll loving sushi lover, this may be a good place for you. I do not like rolls! I like \"real\" sushi...lol...ok, ok, \"real\" in terms of my definition, which is old school nigiri, where you can taste if the quality of the fish (and even rice) is there or not. With rolls, it's easy to get away with masking lack of quality and freshness with all the cream cheese, various sauces, cucumber, etc, so you can't tell anyway. We had tried to get into Goyemon but there was a long wait...so we tried this place, which had no wait at all. So that's a plus. And as another person mentioned, you have to write in your order and it splits it up into first order and second order, or something like that...and my lazy butt doesn't like that ;p . Especially when every other place takes your order and doesn't give you a limit, or at the very least makes it super easy to order.",

Something to note: their spicy tuna is actually spicy! Not like most other places where it's a gelatenous orange premaid clump. Sashimi portions were generous and very tasty. I had mackeral, octopus and salmon. All were excellent. Best of all was their iced green tea. They use gunpowder green tea which is very flavorful and not cheap tea leaves. I spent $102 for lunch for two people which obviously isn't cheap but I'm expensing it on the company so I didn't really care about price! The cost is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars as it's not a great value. I wish they offered an all you can eat option to keep the expense down.",

The waitresses watches you, not because you need something but probably so we don't share with a 6 year old who is busy watching her phone and not eating. Bottom line, this place is not worth the $26.95 for ayce. Don't waste your time.",

We ordered the all you can eat and had to cancel two rolls because we knew we would have not finished them after that roll hit our table.  I would have given 4 stars but there was a service issue at the end.  There were four of us and had left 5 pieces of rolls from 5 different rolls and the server stated she was going to charge us $10 for not finishing.   Really???  1 1/4 piece of roll per person when we canceled the other rolls.  I would return only for that Popcorn Lobster.

In fact we came back the next day to eat more tuna nigiri and try their udon soups. It was as good as the first day.  If you want Japanese chef go to Japan where you might be surprised that not every sea urchin is fresh either.  One reviewer was taken by the sea urchin taste: when you are in the desert, what do you expect, a mini ocean in the back yard?  Quality: fresh and what it should be. However they do not put wasabi right away in nigiri. Rice was warm and not hard, in a perfect proportion to the amount of fish.  Atmosphere: it is not  a fancy restaurant but a pleasant one. Family, friends and dates  would feel comfortable there.  Price is fair for the quality provided.",

I went with a group of 5 for a co-worker's birthday for the all-you-can-eat-and-drink menu ($36 per person - total of $46 including tax and mandatory 18% gratuity for group over 4 people).  After an hour of happy devouring, my hungry co-workers (3 men and 1 girl) finally slowed down, with half a roll of tuna and baked salmon left on the plate. The waitress came by and urged us to cancel the rest of our order until we finish all our sushi, otherwise she said they would charge us. We figured the remaining sushi was equal to one more piece per person to finish, so we insisted on our order of 2-piece sweet shrimp nigiri anyway, because we were craving sweet shrimps.   We waited for another 15 minutes and asked the waitress twice, yet the sweet shrimp nigiri didn't come. Finally the waitress said that they \"ran out of shrimp and is waiting for shrimp to defrost\". That was when we realized that the waitress was counting on us not to finish our roll, and she was not going to bring out the sweet shrimp nigiri until we finish everything.   So we did clear our plate, and finally the sweet shrimp nigiri came. I know sweet shrimp is considered a more expensive item, but this behavior from the restaurant management just feels petty. Considered how much the cost was per person, and that our group was well-behaved and not rowdy, this is no way for a business to treat customers!",

It's also close to the Strip, so if you're from out of town, give this place a try the next time you visit Las Vegas.",

We appreciate this and because of it, we've been coming back here.  Over the last few months,  though, quality and service has steadily declined. As such, tonight may have been the last time we dine at Sushi 21.   It took us 10mins before I could flag down the two waiters working the near empty restaurant. I think they must've felt bad because after I got their attention, it was relatively smooth.  Despite the service, I would be okay with the place if their food was something to write home about. This isn't the case. Fresh oysters were served at room temp; literally almost every piece of nigiri sushi was on top of a piece of lemon; the rice either had too much sushi su or something like yuzu. Almost seemed like they were hiding bad fish quality.  Even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow. Best I can describe it the meat had a strange consistency with a slightly sour taste.  To top off this great dining experience, half the kitchen staff blanketed the entrance with cigarette smoke when we left.  I could've opened up my mouth to mask all the citrus I ate at dinner.",

First of all their appetizer menu is second to none, they have items that other places don't, the food is amazing and very good. The reason that I will not go back is because the last time that I went there before this time I had my sushi rolls made with brown rice which is something that all of the sushi restaurants in Las Vegas are starting to offer for an up charge of 50 cents per roll. I told them that I have had brown rice at sushi 21 before but they refused, they said they don't do brown rice even though I have had it there before. So either they offered it at one point and stopped or they just felt they were too busy to accommodate my request, either way it is enough for me to not want to go back. Sushi with brown rice is delicious and it's chewier and Every other sushi restaurant will offer it on their menu eventually, while this place will not.",

So I don't know if making a reservation here makes a difference or not... Either way... It was a busy night so getting our food took time in between servings. The staff is friendly and attentive and the place is really nice compared to other places I've been to. It's a small place but it feels comfortable and eating there is a delight! We had the AYCE sushi and the only disappointments were that the tiger roll, one of my favorite rolls was not on the AYCE menu and the regular ademame was very bland. You have a lot of options and even though the spicy garlic ademame is very different from other places, it was still a good treat. I would definitely come back to this place.",

Great variety of special rolls so it was easy to branch out and try new rolls that I normally wouldn't. Everything we tried today though, was spectacular!   Service was very quick and staff was nice and attentive. Made me feel very welcome and refilled our drinks and took our old plates before we could finish saying thanks! Very fast!  Atmosphere in here was great too! Went during lunch so it was relatively quiet, though I'm sure they get very busy during dinner. There was a projection of k-pop music as we enjoyed our rolls. Fun music and inviting atmosphere.  We'll definitely come again! Great food, good prices for AYCE. If you're in the area, and you're hankering for some good sushi, come to Sushi 21!",

Once you get in the restaurant don't let the size of the dining room intimidate you, they craft amazing sushi at that place!  They have an unbeatable price for lunch, while still being very competitive at diner time. They will provide you with wonderful appetizers and fresh looking nigiris!!! What I really enjoyed at Sushi 21 was the capability of the chef of craft icing custom Temakis and special orders of sushi depending on your desire!  Located at Tropicana Avenue near by the Strip, this restaurant is a great destination for you and friends to try it out. I would recommend going for their All you can eat special and then ordering some appetizers first, moving on to some salads and finally ordering your sushi!  The chef and servers were extremely friendly and willing to make sure that you get your sushi craving taken care of! This restaurant gets a 5 stars because they have really good sushi for an astonish price.",

For the price one can't beat it.  But the quality and taste really shocked is.    Will bring friends!!!!",

The sushi is the same which is my main reason for going back all the time . I love the sushi there and the cooks are always extremely friendly . The reason for the 3 star review is the service . They literally go through waiters like no other every time we go there is always a new waiter every time we go . Sometimes you'll get a good one and others they are horrible . We went last night and one of the waiters had no idea what she was doing and would she would go to pick up our empty plates she would put her fingers or hands in our food and leave it there expecting us to eat it . She literally put her hand in our miso soup almost spilled it all and left it there so we can finish it and was surprised when we asked her if she could take it back ? If you are a party of 5 or more they automatically charge you 18% gratuity which seems like more of a reason for the waiters not to give a crap of how they serve you because they get that tip either way . If they can fix their staff then I would not hesitate to give the 5 star review .",

Really wanted to walk out at that point but I was persuaded to give it a chance by my party. After being seated, our drink orders were taken and we were left to ponder the menu. After 4-5 minutes a waiter came to take our sushi orders. Our drinks still hadn't shown up yet, and he couldn't have cared less. 15 minutes later our sushi arrives. Still no drinks. Again we ask where are the drinks, to be met with blank stare...... just dropped off the food and walked away. He didn't come back. At all. Another waitress came over and asked how everything was, we told her we still didn't have drinks. She acted more confused than apologetic, but she did get us our drinks. Third time's the charm.... She came back a while later and asked if we wanted more food, a few of our party did order a 2nd round but I was thoroughly disgusted and just done. Ready to burn the place to the ground, we left shortly after the others got and ate their 2nd round. This place is not worth a second chance. Or a first.",

The old check-in offer listed here on Yelp is not even valid, but I had to learn that from some mysterious person in the back who viewed my phone offer. Ummm WHY is it still on their Yelp page? !   I like to sit at the bar because you usually get the best service, but wow!  That's simply NOT True at this establishment.   5:30 pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was dead. There were only 3-other parties, and  3-sushi chefs behind the counter, yet not one of them even bothered to acknowledge our existence until about 3-minutes after we were seated. Mind you, they were standing right there in front of us!    I guess their grub hub order took precedence over customers inside the restaurant. Bottom line: we couldn't even eat here because the servers wouldn't even acknowledge us long enough to take our order.   I won't be back!  To the new Yama we go!  At least we know the food and service is always amazing at Yama Sushi.  Bye bye Sushi 21! We won't be back. Ever.",

The menu: You can order off an all you can eat menu for a really good price for lunch or dinner. They had great choices, but we chose the ala carte menu, which of course adds up to a lot more, but we wanted things specific that weren't on the all you can eat menu.  The food: really good!! the rolls are packed tightly and the baked rolls were perfect temperates. The sashimi was so very flavorful, but I personal would have preferred it more chilled than warm.  But the presentation was beautiful. The only con - is the music videos???? They're a mix of strange asain pop and techno, and just odd and comical.   Overall this is always a great place to go and we will continue to eat here as long as we are in town.",

It's not on the cheap side but still a good deal if you're planning to try many kinds of sushi and rolls and appetizers. Dinner option over lunch option is not really worth it, we only ordered it cause I love sea urchin which is in the dinner menu. However you can only order one serving of the dinner menu items so it's not such a great deal. Sea urchin was awesome though. Service was prompt and relatively nice, and everything came out of the kitchen faster than we couldn clear the plates.",

    "text": "Let me just start off by saying that I hardly ever complain about dining. I work in food service so I understand what it's like, but this place has no excuse. When we walked in it was unusually busy. We were seated in the back booth that had a light out, which was fine since we had agreed to it and there wasn't much else available. It had taken the waiter 10 minutes just to get to us, which was okay seeing as it was packed. But when he got to us, he was all over the place. He took our drink order and then immediately tried to take our first order. We were only given ala cart menus, so when we asked to do AYCE, he had to get the other menus.  He disappeared again for another 10 minutes..... we finally got the other  menus and the drinks and then he asked us to write down all of our orders. Taking our appetizer order is the only job he had! He also didn't give us anything to write with or soy sauce which should already be on the table. We steal everything off of the table next to us. The food is coming out fine up until the end of our first order. We were missing a few items, and you could see when we got our order paper back that they didn't bother to cross those items off as they had done with the other items that were received. We didn't see our waiter again to tell him, or ask for refills on our drinks that were almost gone, instead a really sweet lady came to take care of us while he dissappeared. When we finally got our missing plates, the shrimp tempura was still raw and mushy and the lobster in the baked lobster clearly went spoiled! It was so gross.  We continued to order,  and kept missing more plates, really?   Then in the middle of us eating, she wanted to change the lightbulb that was hanging over our table. Our friend was nice and helped her out,  but it was still just something that shouldnt have been done at the table.... At the end our first waiter miraculously reappears to give us the bill with and an auto gratuity of 18% listed. I get it, but with awful service, a broken light, spoiled and raw food, he didn't deserve what he got. We go here often and every time the food is just okay and the service is terrible. The only reason we go is because it's mutually convenient for our group. But this was the last straw,  I don't think we will be back.",

    "text": "You'll have to go a ways off the strip to find this little gem in the city that never sleeps.    With over 70 awesome rolls to choose from, you know you gotta go AYCE (and I did).  Now, when going AYCE I typically stay away from appetizers.  DO NOT make that mistake by skipping the apps here!  The Dynamite appetizer is a soupy taste of the sea you just have to try.  Little bits of sea creatures in an onion, corn and mushroom soup make this funky bowl of sea goodness something you gotta try.  Second on the \"gotta do\" is the \"cherry blossom\" app: spring mix salad with a ball of avocado slices stuffed with spicy soft shell crab) and a sweet eel sauce.  It's an extremely good way to start the meal.  Oh, and I'll let you experience the \"Screaming Orgasm\" appetizer for yourself (trust me, you'll thank me for allowing you to do so).  Rolls you gotta do: popcorn lobster, fire fire and kiss of fire (I like hot and spicy, and the hottest on the menu is the \"fire fire\").  But look, you really can't go wrong with anything here. From the \"plain\" to the special stuff, it all tastes great!  I ate til I almost exploded. Add in the AYCD(rink) option and you're in for quite the night.   Las Vegas is no exception to the rule that the best food is found in places you're willing to seek out.",

Just a few bites for dinner and we came here for the first time. Please let it be good...we were thinking.   The sushi salmon and yellowtail were fresh!  The dishes all came out straight from the sushi bar and kitchen so the hot stuff was piping hot (tempura and lomein noodles) and the cold stuff could not have been sitting for more than a second. We felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant although there were other tables around. Kudos to great service.   The atmosphere is fun and spacious. Will definitely come back.",

Turned out to be a mistake since Goyeman called us with our table ready the moment we sat down here....but I digress.  The service is literally the slowest....and I mean SLOWEST....of all time. Yes the waitress was nice, but she barely understood English and forgot half of our order every single time we asked for something. The rolls were not rolled firmly, as one can see by how the roll breaks apart by picking it up with chopsticks. Finally, we ordered sashimi which didn't come until an hour later...to top that off, the tuna was a strange off color.   If you do come here, however, they have drink specials and the sauces as well as the baked rolls are not too terrible taste wise if you can get over the fact that you might need a spoon to pick it up.",

The servers couldn't remember the names of the rolls. The food was nothing special. Not a lot of flavor besides the soy sauce and wasabi I used.   I got the baked scallops, and as a baked scallops lover, I was extremely disappointed. For some reason, they shredded the scallops. I've never seen that before. Not to mention, it tasted more like crab meat than it did scallops. When I asked, the chef told me that it was a different recipe so they shred the scallops and that it was \"in there\". Probably means they had it in a mix.   I really don't understand how this place had such good reviews.",

The first lady who answered the phone didn't understand me well and so she transferred someone over who spoke better english but I honestly wasn't upset at all. When I came in to pick it up she was apologetic and thought she was so sweet. I'm sure she gets a bunch of douchebags who give her a hard time but I assured her everything was okay. After I opened my bag they threw in a nice surprise of a roll on the house. It seems as they are extremely nice about taking care of everyone if anything were to happen but I just hope no one tries to take advantage of their amazing service.

Fyi our servers were Korean and didn't understand Japanese or what I was trying to order good thing I know a little Korean LOL!!    My husband likes uni and mirugai fyi only one order of 2 pieces per person so if you are coming here thinking you can have ayce you will be out of luck.  I don't know what the hype is I didn't feel anything. Plus his uni didn't look buttery fresh.  It actually looked almost brown.   Omg they had instant Korean ramen on the menu...    If you know sushi and good quality fish and sushi you will not be happy here. I think this place is for people who think they know what real sushi and Japanese food is or maybe just trying to start to experience it.  Sorry if I am harsh but I have been to be honest and since I have eaten at some really high end places I don't want you to think you are getting that here.   I let my husband pick a AYCE place I think I may need to take back the food decisions lol!!",

My pet peeve is you can't order directly to chef but have to order through waiter even though it's AYCE and at sushi 21 that's their MO. Good and flavorful sushi but there was confusion about whether we were in dinner or lunch AYCE. Chef refused one order because it was a dinner item then I get the check and I'm being charged 2 AYCE dinners. Good sushi but ask first if it's lunch or dinner time.",

    "text": "I wanted to wait till I got home and in front of a computer to write this review. We've eaten at many sushi restaurants in Reno and other cities BUT, we have never eaten at a sushi house this good.  Yes, you do get 10% off if you write a Yelp review but, they didn't check to make sure we wrote a review. It must be a service Yelp offers or the pop up coupon you get when you check in on Yelp wouldn't work. That's fine anyway, Yelp is one of the best ways to advertise and I would write a review one way or another.   There are instructions on the AYCE menu so pay attention. There are certain items on the menu you can only order one of per person, but I own a bookkeeping service and can tell you restaurants run on a pretty slim margin. You can't blame them for not wanting waste. Also, if you do not eat all of your meal you will be charged regular price for that roll.   I'll try to keep this short even though I could go on for a while. We were a party of 5 and we were hungry!  We were looking for something close to the condo and Sushi 21 was there.  We were seated right away and ate easily over a dozen rolls and appetizers. We all agreed that every roll they brought was delicious. The edamami was hot, salted, and the freshest we've had. Yes, I know it was most likely frozen from the supplier BUT, the difference was that it didn't taste like it had been sitting in the steamer all day. Second, the service was amazing. Never once did empty dishes sit on the table for longer than it took us to put the dish aside and start eating another roll. We asked for fresh wasabi which was brought out in short order and it was delicious!  The oysters on the half shell were fresh but, could have used a little more in the way of accoutrements, like horseradish and lemon but, was served properly cut away from the shell and excellent with a spot of sriracha sauce.  The tempura battered anything was delicious. The tempura was light, crispy, tasty, and we could tell the oil used was fresh. We had one order each of the ahi tuna, which was thin sliced served two ways.  There's mayonnaise sauce on each style but, one was spicier than the other and both ways were delicious. Have I said \"delicious\" enough? No.  This is a little gem off the strip, away from the tourist traps and we are so happy to have found it.  If only it was in Reno!  The servers are friendly, QUICK and attentive.  We didn't have to wait long for anything.  One thing I can say for sure, the sushi houses in Reno need to step it up.  Every sushi house we've eaten at, the tempura is either soggy, or tough, and tasteless and/or cooked in old oil. If the owners of Sushi 21 ever open a sushi house in Reno, we will have permanent reservations! This was the best sushi we have ever eaten. This will be our first dinner stop next trip to Vegas!  When in Las Vegas give Sushi 21 a try. I can't guarantee you will have as good of an experience as we had but, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your meal.",

We found the \"specialty\" rolls the best. LOVED the Sexy Girl! But be warned...she is spicy. Plain salmon roll was really fresh as well. Lots of great choices!  All garnished with a GAINT projection of Japanese girl band videos playing on the wall. What a fantastic spectacle that was! I had NO IDEA how much I would love this!  And the best part, even though the price is only $26.99/ea for AYCA, you get another 10% off with a Yelp check in! Sweeeet!  Were had a great time, and no wait!",

I was reluctant, but let him have his way.   We called in our order and the food was delivered very quickly. Since I didn't dine in, I can't comment on the service but the food was ok. Nothing amazing, but definitely solid sushi for the price and convenience of delivery. We ordered rolls mainly and they were tasty. Definitely not the best sushi in town but definitely good for convenience.   They offer dine-in all you can eat options as well as all you can drink.",

If you are super sensitive to spicy items, make sure you tell them that you don't want anything spicy to include sauces on your selection. I ordered 2 items that didn't depict a hot flaming chile yet they were too spicy for me, lucky for me, my bf help me out. Even the baked rolls had an added kick that I had to inquire about so the next round didn't have it.   Enjoy that appetizers come with & a dessert is an extra great bonus to top it off.",

As for the all you can eat sushi- not the best but not terrible. I tried almost every single \"fresh\" sushi they had to offer and they were either highly lacking in flavor or fishy. Yes I know that sounds stupid-you're eating raw fish and you're complaining it's fishy? I'm an avid sushi lover and renowned sushi chefs will stand behind me and say good sushi is not fishy. The chili oil is not very fragrant or flavorful. The best thing about our visit was the rolls. I'd give the rolls like a B. Flavor was there, so was presentation, but the quality of the fish wasn't great. My overall advice is if you visit this place, stick to the rolls.",

They were out of a few of the drinks that I wanted to try so I had to \"settle\" for a bottle of soju.  The waiter, a little astonished by the severity of my alcohol tolerence, i guess, made hand gestures to demonstrate the size of the bottle.  Having played this game before, I quickly smiled and blushed like an anime character and threw up the thumbs up sign, with both hands. The waiter quickly understood and I thought that I heard him proudly tell another waiter as he walked away, \" Errr, ohh thats a Meesta Amerika, Meesta Uuu Ess Aye!\" But that might have been the soju talking or maybe racism.   Anyway, the nigiri, which is always my favorite was acceptable.  It came out fast and I did not have to wait.  I had almost everything and all seemed reasonably fresh.  I had to order the AYCE dinner to get the uni, and as always in vegas it is never orange; it's always a little on the brown side, but it was delicious. What really gives this place four stars, at least for me, was the amount of made up quasi japanese fusion shit that is on their menu.  I had a japanese burrito.  It is basically like a california roll wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried.  I also had a monkey ball, which was like pork and california roll ingredients, breaded, sauced and deep fried.  It was weirdly awesome. Really, the little things on their menu, like crawfish, golden spoon, dynamite, the above and all the other things makes their AYCE well worth it.  I tried sooooo many things and was quite pleased by the end of the meal.  Oh Wait!!! Tempura Oreo!!!!!!  Yeah, I did it, the only down fall was the canned whip cream that accompanied it.  But still, I had a deep fried oreo.  Was it all that tasty?  Any tastier than a non deep fried oreo?  Not really.  But sometimes it's just about the absurdity of the decadence. Kanpai",

It reminded me of a birthday cake. haha - slow service. Never asked for a refill once. Poor explanation of sushi and ice cream. Bad english.

    "text": "I came in to the establishment loving it here fm another experience. However the latest experience was not so enjoyable. My friend and I ordered all u can eat and just ordered 4 rolls which extras rolls came out. When we addressed it they said it was okay and proceeded on talking shit. I am half Korean and black and them not realizing it called my friend and I black slanderous names. This racism has to stop. So I spoke to her in Korean letting her know I understood and then it all stopped. The management got so embarrassed off her actions she left the building. Never again",

    "text": "My husband, two friends and I went for their all you can eat. While the sushi was decent, the service was absolutely horrible. They give you a list to check off what you want, and we told them we wanted two lists, but they'd only give us one. They kept bringing out only what two of us ordered, and the other two wound up sitting and waiting, because we'd order stuff they didn't want. They only brought two rolls at a time, and we'd wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes for the next roll. We never got everything we ordered, and every time we'd tell a waitress we were still waiting on rolls, she'd just nod yes. There was a huge language barrier and when we asked to talk to the manager, she didn't understand what we were telling her. Everyone went home hungry and wound up eating at home.   Also when it came time to get the check? Somehow our 4 all you can eats, with 4 drinks totaled to $150, they totally overcharged us AND added an 18% gratuity for our table, nowhere in the establishment does it say that gratuity is charged for parties of 4.",

Everyone was nice except for this one waitress who gave me this weird eye look when I asked for another ice cream.  What's up with the one eye look? Overall, the food was average and the service would have been 5 stars if she didn't gave me the pirate eye look.",

Then call thirty minutes later to talk to the manager, and they tell me Angela just left about 10 mins ago to deliver my food who is owner of Sushi  21 she shows at my house was extremely rude still wanting to charge me full price and takes the food and goes! I will never order from  this place ever again. They are dishonest and the ownership is extremely rude.",
