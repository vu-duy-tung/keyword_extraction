Eggs were served to me over medium steak well done hashbrowns were old and dry. Sent the eggs back waitress Cynthia seemed offended by me sending the eggs back. My sisters pouched eggs one was perfect the other completely over cooked. This location should do egg preparation training a morning cook must know how to properly cook an egg.",

    "text": "We stopped here when we arrived in Las Vegas at the end of July for a late lunch.  We were looking for something \"local\" and wanted to avoid chains as best we could.  Black Bear has more than one location (as we found out later), but I wouldn't consider it a chain.  There were five of us in our party, 4 adults and one teenager.  We were greeted and seated at a round table near a window.  Bobb (yes, with two Bs), was our server and he immediately took our drink order.  While he was getting our drinks, another server asked if we were taken care of, which was nice.  Bobb brought our drinks, and asked where we were from and about our trip, giving us some tips along the way.  We ordered our food.  Some of us ordered breakfast and the rest lunch items. I ordered their Chicken and Waffles, which was very good.  Everything came out excellent and the portions are huge, so bring a big appetite.  Bobb popped by now and then chatting about our meal or just in general.  He kept trying to get us to order dessert, but we were all very satisfied and stuffed from our meal.  We chatted with Bobb one last time before we left (handing the tip to him personally) to go pay for our meal at the front counter.  We thanked him for a pleasant first experience on our first trip to Las Vegas.  If you are in Las Vegas area, I would highly recommend a meal at the Black Bear (and sitting in Bobb's section).  The restaurant and bathrooms are clean, and you get a reasonably priced, big portioned meal that is excellent.  Great service from everyone from the hostess and waitstaff, to the cashier at the counter.  What's better than that?",

When we finally got him back asked if I could get something else since the sandwich I ordered was too spicy. We will keep it. It take it home and pay for it so because everyone else is half done with diner. Bring me a grilled cheese sandwich. That will only take a few minutes to cook. He said ok brought the box and then went for drinks for us and never came back for 30 minutes. I asked is that grill cheese coming and the drinks you went for 30 minutes ago he came back said be up any minute. Well all had finished so I said forget it just give me the bill. He left for another 10 minutes. A casual diner turned into a major hassle and I didn't eat. Spoke to manager and she didn't offer anything to help or other but sees us all the time. So avoid the place people. Used to be good but has already turned bad.",

I ordered an egg white ham & cheese omelet & a side of fruit. Very simple!!! After waiting and watching a male employee sneezing repeatedly right next to the food into the sink with no covered face he grabbed plates & took food out. Seeing what I thought was my fruit & omelet for 5 minutes sitting up there it ended up being the smallest omelet I ever saw & the cheese & ham were cold & not even melted on the top of the omelet.

We were blessed to have gotten 2 seats at the counter rather quickly and boy, am I glad we did! We were so impressed at the front line staff's attention to detail as meals came out of the kitchen. They were a finely tuned machine. From the runners to the servers, and the manager who was in the trenches with his staff - they were efficient, calm yet assertive, and they all seemed to really enjoy working together. This was my first time in Vegas - but not my first time at a Black Bear (normally only occasionally eat here as I am eating healthy) and this will be our regular stop on the way in and out of Vegas. Well done! Also happy to see more fit friendly choices. Everything was delicious! One warning: watching all those pancakes and biscuits coming out is not easy when you're trying to eat lighter - everything looks great! Did have a bite of my husband's spicy sausage patty and it was super yummy!",

    "text": "If you would like a little something to take home how about SALMONELLA?  Was in last night about 8PM.  Friendly greeting, immediately seated, lots of help.  This is the first time myself and my husband had been here.  Hubby ordered chicken & waffles, I ordered biscuits and gravy.  It seems like our food was at the table in a flash.  My biscuit was stale and hard on the outside, and doughy and a little raw on the inside. Gravy was tasteless.  I sent it back.  Hubby's waffle had a weird texture. Very soft and mealey, but he ate it.  Chicken was a thinly pounded breast and heavily breaded.  He eats some of it, and then I looked over at him and I said, stop eating it.  It is pink and undercooked. So now hubby is annoyed at me because I sent my food back and now I want to point out the issue with the chicken.  He goes in the car and I am left to address the issue. Upon checking out, the manager discounted our biIl.  Personally if I was the manager the item would have been removed from our check. I don't want anything for free, but in this situation that was the appropriate thing to do.  While I know they are still working out the bumps in the road because they are new, serving improperly cooked chicken is absolutely unacceptable. I give them 1 * because of the health danger that was present in the food, even though service was very good. I went back and sat at the counter.  I was sitting about 10 minutes before I was acknowledged and I placed by order, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. About 5 minutes later a man sat down next to me and ordered the California benedict. About 6 minutes later the man next to me got his food. What's going on here?  Finally my server is back in the counter area with a plate of food that she tells cooks this is the wrong order. She brought it to the table and the diners told her it was wrong and then she puts it in front of me! I immediately told her I will not eat it.  She tried to say they didn't touch it.  That might be True but I don't know if they sneezed or coughed on it.  Really at that time I should have left, but I was hungry.",

Taryn was my server, kept my iced tea glass full, helped me navigate a made-to-order dinner with prime rib with eggs, potatoes and a pancake. The food was very good, and the service was great. I had several people check on my dinner, my ice tea, and felt like I was well taken care of. My wife and I ate here on one of the first days it was open, and really enjoyed it. Last night helped seal the deal, this is one of our favorite little quirky, fun, good comfort food restaurants. BBD has many locations around the country, but I felt like they were very personable. Just a rebuttal to Ralph W., our first night, we had an issue with our gift card, and they gave us a very generous discount, even though they couldn't read our card. If something was wrong at this BBD, I believe this staff would have taken very strong steps to correct the problems.",

Instead of ditching the spot and heading down to IHop I went inside to check on the wait. 30 minutes for a party of 2. That sounds problematic.... however this is where my 5 star factor kicks in early. The bar at the front entrance is OPEN SEATING. I jumped across the floor and slid into a couple of seats next to the fresh juice machine.  While I'm speaking of fresh juice... they squeeze real oranges and make REAL orange juice. It smells freaking awesome and it's cool to watch the machine spinning and doing its thing. The coffee was fresh, and they will toss you some flavored creamer if you ask nicely.   I was super hungry and ordered the Big Bear chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit, and 2 massive biscuits. These things were no joke. The service was quick, efficient, and pleasant. Food was awesome, and definitely more then needed. It's a solid spot, especially after a night of strip adventures and such.",

We sat at the counter and got a great view of how everything runs. Shout out to our waiter Sandor. Hard working always moving and constantly checking on us. Great customer service. Now let's talk about the food.  The biscuits are amazing. (See pictures) bacon delicious.  My husband said the hot sauces were really good as well. The team work that this staff displays rocks. We watched as everyone helped each other get food to tables. Everyone on shift this morning was moving with a purpose. Cleanliness is a plus. Watched servers wipe things down, constantly cleaning.  Even the public restrooms were clean. (That's a super plus for me) This is definitely a place I will come back to. If I could give more stars I would. Keep up the good work.",

I ordered the special: Prime Rib Scramble.  Our server recommended country potatoes. The Scramble was so so. It lacked seasoning. The veggies were under cooked in both the scramble and the country potatoes. The best part of the meal was the buttered sourdough toasts.  Other food at our table was the corned beef hash. It was a large portion of shredded brisket corned beef. The over easy eggs were good. Once again, the meat was under seasoned.  The chicken fried steak was stellar! Crispy and perfectly breaded. The white gravy was delicious! Over hard eggs were beautiful according to my daughter.  The bacon they served was thick and cooked well.  Black Bear Diner was oaky. I would like to come back for more Chicken fried steak. I want to try dessert especially the lava cake and pies. Did you know they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day?",

When the hostess came she promptly sat us (which we were happy about and thought it was a good sign). I guess she didn't notice my two younger children because she didn't give us kid's menus. When I approached her to request some kid's menus she actually groaned and asked how many. We ordered finally and then never saw our waitress again until she delivered the food to the table next to us-which was seated and ordered well after us. She said over her shoulder, \"Yours is coming\" as my husband looked on. We waited some more.... Then they brought out the wrong order for one of us. When I asked about it, they didn't have a real explanation but said, \"well what else would you like?\" Needless to say, the service was the worst we've ever had but the food was fine.",

I got the grizzly breakfast which came with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and 2 pancakes. The food tasted great although my friend that ordered with me cannot eat red meat and chose online to substitute fruit but they didn't give us fruit and we did not notice until we got home. I would go back to this place again although I would probably dine in instead of taking out.",

When I asked about it, they apparently ran out of steak and tried to be slick by giving me a different kind of meat. The server was quick to leave my plate too. I didn't even have time to ask about it. I would have been okay with changing my order. What they did was wrong.",

Came in on a Wednesday morning around 9:30 with no wait. Got seated, and all of a sudden the place was packed. I see why they have so many servers running around in those cute bear print suspenders. Everyone I encountered on this visit was nice and attentive.  Food is A-1 at a good price, especially in an age where places are charging a limb & a half for simple breakfast items. I ordered the Taco Salad with Chicken (yes, that early in the am). It was HUGE. Way more than enough for lunch and dinner, so I packed half away before I even got started. Fresh ingredients all around and great house-made bacon ranch dressing. Not bad at all for $10.95.  My companion got a huge pancake platter w/ all the fixins. I had a bite of her pancakes even without syrup and they were perfection. I will definitely be back here to try a lot more stuff on the menu.",

It is sad to us because we love BBD and brought a friend and this ones only similarity was the decor. The service was pretty good and the Restaurant very clean but the food was poorly prepared. We ordered a few different breakfast items and all had issues. However we were starving by the time the food arrived and so sending it back was not an option since it took so long to get. My biscuit and gravy scramble consisted of hard biscuits, barely warm coagulated gravy and burnt sausage but my potatoes were great and the eggs cooked perfectly. My husbands chicken fried steak breakfast had way over cooked hash browns and the chicken fried steak was so overly breaded that's all we could taste. All covered with the same not hot enough gravy. My friends hobo omelette was good but his hash browns were also way over cooked and his biscuits hard and covered in. Not quite hot gravy. BBD this site was a HUGE disappointment.",

The turkey was seasoned perfectly and you get a ton of mashed potatoes. I also finished my friends pancake which was great as well. Everybody was happy with their meals.   I wish I'd have done this earlier or kept my receipt because our waiter was the best, but I don't think I'm going to get his name right since it was about a week ago. I want to say it was something like Scaldano, and I'm so sorry to be butchering his name after he took such good care of us.  We were a big party with a bunch of kids, 3 split checks, and a to go order, and he handled it all effortlessly. We took forever to order and he kept coming back to check on us until we were ready but never pressuring us. He got all our orders correct and was friendly, attentive and gracious throughout our meal. The food was great but the service was even better. I really wish I knew his name for sure because he deserves to be recognized for his effort in making our dining experience exceptional. So if a Manager at this establishment is reading this and needs to contact me to confirm who it was I'd be happy to help. I did speak to a Manager at the time we were there but wanted to post this as well for his recognition.  To sum up, this place is great, food and service. If you're near it, go. Bravo to this establishment and it's employees!",

And I am so glad we stopped by here for lunch because everything we had here was great!   After looking at many pictures from Yelp, I decided to get taco salad and I gotta say, that taco salad was the best taco ish food I've ever had. I mean I had lots of taco bowl, salad, etc but damn, this salad was so amazing. It was huge too! Like it was full of fresh salad, chicken, bean, and some avocado on side. I got there with my empty stomach but I was in a food comma by the time we left there.    Waiting wasn't too terrible and staff was nice too. Also, I think price here was pretty reasonable too compared to other fancy brunch places on the strip. I highly recommend Black bear if you are looking for a decent breakfast/brunch and dinner place!!",

The other server brought our drinks and the wrong server brought our food didn't see either of them again didn't come back once to see if we needed anything or refilled our drinks. After sitting there for a while they finally came over with a balance. On top of that the food wasn't even good. Eggs were dry, red potatoes not crispy and toast was burnt first and last time for me. I really do like their set up live the best theme and the decorations does have a good vibe and I did really like their habanero hot sauce and the chipotle hot sauce great job with those.

I don't know how you can still sell this and be okay with it when it's clearly not good anymore. The brownie was inedible. It was hard as hell !!! If you're okay with giving me this brownie that is clearly past it's best by date, then that makes me wonder what else they'll willing to overlook when it comes to prepping the food because the food did not taste fresh at all!! Tasted like it was reheated several times.",

So either this location purposely served us the worst imaginable food or the kitchen was having a really off day.   They messed up a 4 item omelette. Burnt the toast, didn't completely cook the country fried steak, skillet potatoes were cold and under cooked, the burger was rubbery and flavorless, the chicken sausage was inedible and I have had freezer burnt frozen waffles that had more flavor and personality than the abomination they served us and I the chicken parmesan was not recognizable as such.   The water was wet so they managed not to ruin 100% of what was ordered.",

Biscuits should be dense, buttery, flakey, and all other words that remind you of biting into pieces of thick, multi layered dough heaven. When your biscuit texture resembles more like corn bread texture, don't get me wrong, cornbread is life, but it's going to throw off the taste of a traditional biscuit and gravy side plate. Texture/texture/texture!!! Very important! People often forget about texture consistency! It makes a difference! Anyhow, moving along!   Service was very sweet! Huge portions! So Large of a menu it almost forces you to have ADHD. I definitely just picked out a category and like crossword puzzles, I waited for my eyes to blur and for a description to jump out at me. Worked pretty well if you ask me! I was happy with my order. Bummed about my darn biscuits and gravy, but portion size and item wise (rhyme intended) it was diner quality. I'd come back to check out their other options! Service and portions will keep me coming! Just don't expect belly excitement when it comes to their biscuits and Gravy. I'm still not over the disappointment.",

I wasn't expecting that but in the end, I was happy cause it allowed us to try the other flavors.   I ended up ordering the chocolate cream pie, banana cream pie, and apple cobbler. My favorite was the chocolate cream pie. I love this pie. It's so good. It's tasted like chocolate pudding with a chocolate cookie crust. It was so good.

The food was amazing! The serving sizes were HUGE! Our nice server did forewarn us lol but we enjoyed every single second we were in there. Seriously. I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast joint to stop by before leaving Vegas - our weekend was amazing!  I got the cinnamon roll french toast that came w a side of fresh fruit, softened butter, maple syrup, & I ordered a side of sausage - 10/10. No words. One of the best i've had!

But once we were seated, the little bit of the wait we'd had was forgotten because the service was really good. The servers were attentive and so friendly. The food was good. My two companions had the open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy; both said it was very good. I had a BLT. The sour dough bread was toasted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh--one slice of tomato on the sandwich wasn't enough--it made the sandwich a little dry--so I was a little disappointed but the fries were very very good--nice and crunchy.  We would go back. But please, more tomato",

    "text": "So... as they say all that glitters is not gold. I tried this diner again for breakfast as indicated in my earlier review, and, unfortunately, it did not live up to the previous visit. My expectations were definitely not met.  To start, we had to wait a L-O-N-G time for a table. Then, when seated, they have gave us a table for six when we only needed room for four. I assume that's what took so long. Before we ordered, I observed two individuals who had arrived after us paying their check and we had yet to order, that's how long of a wait I mean.  Then, I specifically asked the waitress, are the waffles crispy? She says yes. So, I ordered a crispy waffle. Now, when the waffles arrives, do you think it was crispy? You already know it wasn't. The PROBLEM is on principle, she knows there is NO way to make a crispy waffle at this restaurant. Why you ask? Because they have a personalized waffle maker which has a bear paw imprint into the center of the waffle. This however prevents the waffle from ever becoming crispy because there are insufficient ridges with which to generate crispiness during the cooking process thereby rendering the product a waffle shaped pancake with is generally flat in the middle. Thus, the waitress mislead me, I don't like that and had another item selected already in the event that she would have been truthful and said no our restaurant serves waffle shaped pancakes. That makes me mad. I really wanted a Crispy Waffle. Do not order the waffles if you think they're going to be crispy because you will be disappointed as I was.  Now, my daughter ordered the pineapple upside-down pancakes. They were also misrepresented. The description on the menu indicated that there would be brown sugar marinated pineapple chunks inside of fluffy waffles with a maraschino cherry. There was no brown sugar marination, the pancakes  were fluffy, but the taste of pineapple did not penetrate the normal pancake batter, there was no sugar, and so they should have just been called pineapple topped pancakes.  My other daughter ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. Now, the crispy chicken sandwich is actually very delicious. Hence the reason I'm not giving them two stars.  So you ask, would you come here again? Yes. However, I would only eat lunch, their sandwiches and burgers are good, breakfast not so much and the dinner's seemed really heavy which is not my kind of food.",

One of my favorites is the classic 2-egg dish with their homemade spicy sausage patties. The sausage is pretty spicy and super flavorful. Like, I crave it. So, so good. Their hash browns and home-potatoes are good, and we've never had an incorrect order (we've been there about 5 times or so).  I also LOVE their California Benedict. The bacon is perfection and the hollandaise sauce is perfect for my taste. Simple, flavorful. Did I mention their whole-grain pancake?!?! My favorite. The hubs prefers their sweet cream pancake. You can't go wrong either way.  Now we need to get back for lunch or dinner so I can report back...:)",

I brought it up to our waitress so we wouldn't get charged for it. The waitress never apologized or offered to get avocado on the side. My dad ordered coffee. She never came around for a refill. Matter of fact, she never came around to see if we needed anything or to find out how everything came out. Not one smile was cracked. I'm easygoing because I understand customer service and how tough it is to work in that line of work sometimes. However, there is no excuse for flat out poor customer service. Worst experience ever with wait staff. Come for the food but definite improvements are needed for the service.",

The staff clean and friendly and seem to be very experienced, they were very busy and the kitchen and wait staff really held it togethe really well as I watched them pick up there orders on the line, again believe me I know. Most of the plates I saw were breakfast and they looked great large portions beautiful big biscuits, I ordered the lunch special the prime rib philly cheese steak and debbie ordered the Mediterranean salad both were very good I liked the bread too, everything was hot and fresh.

They have great waffles, pancakes, eggs (served many different ways) and biscuits at least two inches tall!  I was impressed by the employees and their happy attitudes. Most impressive was the manager that was at the window making sure the food was getting out in a timely manner, then he was at the hostess stand making sure guests were being seated as promptly as possible, and then he worked the dining area to make sure guests were enjoying their meals. Needless to say, we went back for brunch the next day before catching our flight. Black Bear Diner will always be on our places to eat from now on.",

They should have went above and beyond and waived my food from my bill which was not. Also, the manager never came over to the table to apologize. Instead, the waitress said her \"boss\" was taking care of it which I don't know what that means. For that reason, I will not be returning to this location.

We are originally from Oklahoma but moved here from the ATL a couple years ago so we love southern style cooking and breakfast. We had tried several other spots around town that did not have that come back appeal until we found Black Bear through Yelp.   We are also not ones to typically do counter seating but due to how busy it is we usually can get seated right away and the service is personable and top notch.  Every time we come in they yell our names and greet us with a smile and a hug as it has become a family atmosphere for us. So much so that we invited our regular server and her amazing husband to our Super Bowl Party!!  We have been to other Black Bears around town and in Reno and none have compared to the service and cleanliness of this on on South Las Vegas BLVD.

We tried a few new breakfast restaurants on this trip and have to say I ended up liking this one the best.  Our waitress was great.  We got a a little nervous when she didn't write any of our 5 orders down.  But everything was 100% correct when we got our food.  Huge portions of everything we got.  Can easily be shared or leftovers taken home.  I had an omelet and hashbrowns and opted for a biscuit instead of toast.  All was really good and the biscuit was larger than my fist.",

After eating Dennys all week while in vegas, having a good meal like this made me kinda feel so much better.

They run around a bit haphazard but get the job done.  The place is pretty clean for a family joint that has kids dropping food on the floor.

First time was ok and now 2 months later my family was asking what happened to the service and quality of food. We walked in a girl on the counter typing something. It took her probably 5 min to mumble something. Than another person came and showed us to the table. Drinks came 12 min later no straws, no spoon for the hot tea. Server Ashley coughing badly. Nice but obviously not in her best shape. Lunch came from another unhappy lady tosing loudly plates on the table. Turns out no pot roast left we had to choose another dish. Walking around us the lady from the register and another one complaining to each other and making faces. Food came french fries too fried, stingy on the hollandaise sauce and fruits were so old that was squishy and sticky in the plate looking as unhappy as the staff. Black Bear Dinner Sahara location is a place that deserve better management for sure apart from the poor service and food.",

If you don't like yolk, they'll scramble the eggs for you or cook them how you like. Also comes with some fresh avocado on the side. Lastly, their sweet tea is delicious too. Definitely a restuarant you should check out!!",

As usual,  they did not disappoint!  Just happened to be their inaugural day and in True BBD style everything was amazing! If you have never been...you have got to go! Fabulous foofd, attentive and friendly staff that treat you like longtime friends...and an overall warm atmosphere! Oh, and you have got to try their sausage...to DIE for! Oh my goodness!",

Well this was a 5 star experience. Perfect good...excellent service..good prices . The wait time was just a few minutes as they were packed at noon on  Black Saturday 25 Nov.  I had the chicken pot pie...I expected to be disappointed...WOW a total great dish. My granddaughter had the BQQ ribs...excellent..excellent...excellent. Her friend had a burger...very large ...looked great. Be sure to register for their email special and get one of their bear claw pastries and coffee on your next visit for free. Love them. Also something extra on your birthday.  I'll try the one Green valley Rd and Sunset as it's very near me. Hope it's as good as this place. I'll keep you posted.",

However, we were seated at the dreaded \"no one's table\" which is that table that none of the wait staff believe is their responsibility. Finally flagged down a waitress who agreed to take care of us. Only, she didn't. She placed our order, then ignored us, spending quite a bit of time chatting with a customer seated at another table, never once glancing up so I could get her attention. I finally flagged down another waitress as she zipped by, who very kindly said she would check for us and the food did then  finally appear. And, in my opinion, it was just OK but nothing special. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "The very first place we went to in Vegas, even before registering into the hotel. I sat on the front bench to get acclimated to the surroundings, after all, I had driven all the way here from San Jose. My parents were next door to the Filipino restaurant with her childhood classmates. I was not about to join them, knowing they would be chatting about the good old days. It was either an El Salvadorean place that sold Pupusas or the Black Bear Diner. Since I've already been through my eating pupusas phase, I decided to eat here since I've never been to the one in my area (Milpitas). I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak because I've never had it before. I got a salad with ranch because Caesar dressing was not available. It was very good, but because I drove all the way from Northern California, I was still full from breakfast 2 hours earlier. I wish I would have finished it, but I ended up taking it to the hotel but didn't eat the rest because we didn't have a microwave oven in the room. It was a nice place with a very extensive menu and very attentive servers. At least I know there is one nearby if I ever decide to go there again.",

The food was just okay, I asked if they have turkey bacon or sausage but they didn't have any other substituon for people like me who cant have bacon or pork sausage for a religion reason. Then come the worst service from Barbara who from the beginning wasn't very attentive. Literally she was just there to take the order and drop the check. Hello, where is the service? She never came by to take away my empty plates, or refill my drink. Then when I asked for my water to be refill she brought a new one WITHOUT A STRAW but yet with her biggest attitude. At the end here she comes to drop the check after nowhere to be found. She had the gut to rush me and my husband by trying to take the plates away that still had food on it. And when we asked another server for a togo box for our food since our server nowhere to be found again, this server wasnt happy that we asked her maybe because she thought it wasnt her table. All in all these servers need to improve their customer service skill and maybe common sense. People come here to have a good meal and good service experience not to look at angry n mad faces from your servers. If you dont like your job stay home please these people dont deserve to experience your unhappiness.",

Just lettuce, shredded carrots, 2 cucumbers and 2 small tomatoes and the ranch dressing was gross. Had bacon bits in it and not good bacon. The fake crunchy bacon flavored crap.  Next, our meal was brought out for 2 of us. My husband asked where his was and the guy snickered like we were kidding? After 5 minutes my husband had to get up, find our server and ASK where his meal was. The Server said the kitchen burned his 1st order ( chicken and waffles) and would bring his order right out. Ummm... they could have told us that. So, he had to wait another 5 minutes. Meanwhile, his family is eating without him so our food won't get cold.  Next, our food was just bland. The mashed potatoes taste old and we're just barely warm. The Chicken fried steak was nothing special. It tastes like any frozen chicken fried steak you buy at Sams or Costco. The vegetable side was cut up zucchini and red peppers. Yuck and it was Barely cooked. I will say the macaroni and cheese was ok and the cornbread was good. Next time, I'll go to Cracker Barrel if I want home cooked food and not bland hospital type food",

Portions are large; even ordering off of the \"little less\" menu for those who have smaller appetites, I still had left overs. Prices are comparable to other breakfast joints around town.   Now to the not so good. Why is the music so dang loud? I could barely hear my friend from across the table. I'm all for playing music, but not nightclub loud. The tables are cramped together. With my pregnant belly and the other table behind me, I barely had enough room to scoot myself in. I took home my left over pancakes and had them the next day for breakfast. They were crumbly and falling apart as I took it out of the to-go container. I've never had pancakes from other breakfast places just crumble. And probably the nail in the coffin to this unpleasant visit was the soggy bacon. I can't stand when bacon is flimsy, almost to the point where I question if it's safe to eat or not.   Other people may love this place, but I'm just not a fan. Sorry not sorry.",

Wasn't packed when we went around 3pm. Menus were cute--made newspaper style. I ordered a patty melt with sweet potato fries and an Arnold Palmer. Food came super fast, was freshly done and still hot. They have more than one type of hot sauce, which is a winner in my book! They service breakfast, lunch and dinner all day.",

I can never finish any of the entrees I order even the little less options. Service is always family-friendly and the prices are more than reasonable when you see how massive the dishes are. Their dessert is not any different. When you walk-in you get drawn to the behemoth sized dessert options next to the register. The desserts could be split by 2-3 people, that's how big these bad boys are. The newspaper menus make for great conversation starters and the atmosphere is always laid back.",

It was that great experience so when I saw they have various branches all over, I made sure that we'll go & eat again at their Vegas branch. I'm fascinated with their newspaper like menu lists. It's unique, absolutely great service & of course food is amazing! I highly recommend! It feels at home!",

Went on a Friday morning after work with a coworker and was seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and fast to get our food and drinks. Checked on us often and since it was my first time there, explained to me what their restaurant was all about and offered recommendations. I ordered their Portuguese sausage and eggs (definitely not like Portuguese sausage from Hawaii, but it was still good) and I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the whole stick of sausage haha. It also came with a slice of watermelon, hash browns, and pancakes. I didn't think I was gonna finish it, but I guess I was more hungry than usual that morning. And I was totally in a food coma on the way home. Lol. I love their baby bear hot sauce - tasted great with the food I ordered. They have 2 other sauces on each of their tables - mama bear and papa bear. I will try those next time I visit. I don't think there was anything that makes this restaurant really stand out compared to other places similar to it, but I had a good first experience so I'll be back.",

The reason I didn't give a 5 is that the biscuits are dry and they don't give enough gravy.  The gravy was bland but I'm a southern girl and I expect lots of flavor from my biscuits and gravy.  The other reason is that the waitress was no where to be found, although friendly, we didn't get any drink refills of water or coffee until the meal was over and we grabbed her.  So I suggest someone to come around and just do drink refills for guests.  And add sausage to that gravy, give it some flavor!!!",

The scramble entrees are huge and the pancakes are amazing - soft, moist, sweet cream pancakes!  Also, the menus are newspapers! Adorable.

    "text": "I woke up one Saturday morning craving pancakes. My roommate who used to live in Arizona (and therefore no stranger to the Black Bear chain) remembered this place had just opened near the mall.  We got there around 11:30 a.m. and was quoted a 20 minute wait for two people. We waited on a bench outside for about 10 minutes before a couple large tables were seated and we could move to a bench inside. We were led to our table maybe five minutes after that.  Pros: The portions were ENORMOUS - I almost made the mistake of ordering three pancakes. Two of those plate-sized babies were more than enough, before the side of eggs, toast, and potatoes I ordered separately.  The food was delicious and hit the breakfast/brunch spot on the nose. No surprises, no exotic touches, just good old-fashioned diner food done right. The pancakes were fluffy, potatoes were crispy, and the eggs a perfect sunny-side up. I honestly can't think of a single complaint.  Cons: None. The food was fantastic, the service flawless, and the wait for brunch on a Saturday extremely manageable. I'll be back the next time (and every time) I have a craving for an unreasonably large stack of delicious, fluffy chocolate chip pancakes, or every other week!",

I'm a very picky eater and I thought everything I ate had the BEST flavor of any restaurant I'd ever been to! I had the 2 egg breakfast with the chicken fried steak and my mom and bro both had the 2 egg with hamsteak breakfast. Fabulous! Best breakfast for dinner we could possibly ask for. Folks that work here are very nice and they really care about their customers.  The atmosphere is very cozy and I usually hate eating out but this place is 5 stars! 10 stars if I could give it that high of a rating!",

She came out of the kitchen and proceeded to stand and talk with other wait staff. we were not acknowledge us or come in our direction. As we continued to wait Shandi who was serving another area came to us and asked if we had been served. We said \"No\" she apologized for the oversight and immediately brought us beverages and took our order. She said she would expedite our order since we had been waiting. She could not have been more apologetic and pleasant. She talked with my grandson and was delightful to all of us.  She was not only serving but also busing tables when patrons left. She is an asset to your business. She turned an almost bad experience into a favorable one. I will come back next time I'm in LV. You need more people like her.",

I went for dinner and ordered the pot roast. It was delicious, so I came back a few days later to get a cheeseburger for lunch. I was expecting an amazing burger, but what came was a few notches below your typical one paddy In-N-Out burger. It was small and typical: nothing special. I did not think the fries were all that great either. A few days later I came for breakfast. I ordered bacon and eggs. It was excellent. In just three visits, I've seen the good and the bad. This place is known for big, American sized portions of food. It's mostly comfort food. If you're into that type of thing, you might like what they do there. However, if you're not a fan of big plate loads of food, you should try somewhere else. I give a thumbs up for breakfast and a so-so rating for lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "We've been to a few Black Bear diners so visiting this one in Las Vegas was already a familiar setting. I believe it was very newly built so it doesn't have the same fun bear charm that some of the others have. There were four of us in for breakfast and we all decided to have the Huevos Ranchos. We also got a huge bear claw for something extra. Coffee all around completed our breakfast. The Rancheros was really very good and we all enjoyed it. It came with fresh fruit and country potatoes that really made the dish. The bear claw was a disappointment because they murdered it in the microwave! Really pissed me off because it turned hard within minutes and was extremely hot. Service wasn't bad but could have been much better.",

She made sure that we got everything that we needed and brought out some things to us that were mistakes that she was in the process of \"fixing\". The few folks dining here when we arrived definitely noticed my daughter. She waved at all of them and they waved back.  She walked to a few folks to give high fives, hugs, and kisses.  The patrons are all so nice. Some of them chatted with me and my husband.  Our food came and it was on!  We jumped into our food and I doubt we came up for air til it was all gone. Everything was delicious. We were super duper extra hangry, but we've been here a few times to know that their food has been consistently tasty and fresh. The value is great for our little family of 3. I wanted to get a bear claw but we didn't have any way to store it and we were just too full.  The restrooms are well maintained here, yay!  The cashier is friendly and is on topi of it.   Everyone seems to do their part and pick up for others where they can. I guess you could say that this is like any other diner but for us, it's our first choice. Be sure to take a photo with the bears outside. With each location that we have been to, we take a photo with the bears and my daughter. Fun. I know this also sounds nutty but joining their email club, you can get some pretty good coupons in there.",

    "text": "I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars for the food. It's always delicious at any black bear diner. The rest is below their chain standards. We went there Sunday for breakfast and they were busy but from the time we walked in and put our name on the wait list it was down hill from there. Other people that came in after us were getting seated first, not just us there was another couple next to us had been waiting also. We finally get seated and the music wasn't their normal oldies music instead it was some loud hip hop music. We were seated right across from the jukebox it was so loud we asked to be moved. That music made me feel very irritable. We asked about the music and the waitress said that a customer had put money in to play music but I don't so. It was like a whole cd worth of music. I felt like getting up and leaving. The wait staff seemed to enjoy it, some were singing some lyrics and another person standing near the entrance to the kitchen was moving to the beat. This makes me think somebody brought in their own cd. I was glad when it was finally done and it went back to its normal jukebox tunes. The service is usually great but they were very busy and no one ever stopped to see if we needed any refills or to see if everything was alright. But they were very busy. After our meal we left to pay, there again another problem! No one to take our money. There were other people standing in line to pay and no one to take our money. We finally just left our money along with the bill and walked away. I'm sure we probably could have just walked out and no one would have known. Either they need better management or hire or schedule more people on Sunday. I've been to other black bear diners with much better service, and great wait staff and great atmosphere. Somebody needs to step it up a bit at this Las Vegas location, seriously.",

I know they are so busy and working under pressure but that's not an excuse to not treating the paying customer properly. The food is not bad. I'm not sure If I will be revisiting this restaurant any time soon. One thing I loved about living in this city (Las Vegas) is the enormous number  of restaurants here.

The morning rush crowd wasn't in yet so it was nice and quiet.  Other servers not assigned to our table would stop by and ask if I wanted more coffee frequently.  Great stuff there.  BB food:  My California omelet was tasty and all the ingredients were fresh.  Wheat bread was toasted perfectly and the portions were in line with the price point of all our dishes.  The steak and eggs special was a win and the pancakes are larger than usual.  Overall everything I sampled from my friend's breakfast dishes were flavorful.    BB Ambiance:  A jukebox powered by the patrons keeps music in the background.  There's plenty of booths, seating and a counter for this very popular diner.  The theme has this log cabin, forestry feel with plenty of wood utilized for the seating and decor.  In summary, this is a great Diner that serves tasteful comfort food dishes.  At about 9:30 AM, there was huge breakfast rush and the whole waiting area was at full capacity quickly.  Something to consider when you feel like stopping by, but Black Bear Diner is popular because they deliver.  Enjoy!",

Loved the bear decor throughout the diner. They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner items which were all available to order.   Shantel was my waitress and she was very sweet and friendly. She gave good food advice and made nice small talk with our table.  I ordered the bacon cheddar burger with a fried egg added on and a side of sweet potato fries.  Food was delicious and didn't take to long to arrive. Burger has nice flavor and was pretty big. I love sweet potato fries and these were good as well.   I definitely would go back, I want to try the chicken and waffles or the French toast.",

The menu is pretty extensive so definitely had a hard time deciding what to try but went with Bears Choice which is your basic two eggs, pancake and choice of meat combo.  But basic also meant lots of food!   Pancakes were a generous size and were fluffy and tasted delicious even without syrup.  Loved how they cooked the bacon, crispy yet not burnt.   Had a bite of Thank you country fried steak and that was good and would definitely go back and order that.   Restaurant was very busy but they friendly and attentive.   They had a juke box which played great music throughout our meal.  Great touch!",

If you have a small group of say 2 or less it definitely pays to stick your head in and look to see if you can find open seating at the front bar. The service is much quicker at the bar then it is at the table and this will shave 30 minutes off your time at the restaurant easily.   I really like the country fried steak and gravy it comes with hashbrowns a couple eggs and I opted for 1 pancake instead of a biscuit. The pancakes are huge and absolutely delicious here!   Load up your hash browns with some of the papa bear hot sauce. It is so addictive. I am definitely going to purchase some bottles of it next time I'm in this joint!",

The menu is created and shaped like a newspaper - Genius!  The portions are huge here, you could share dishes or be selfish and have your own!  We ordered Fit & Focus Chicken and Apple Sausage Scramble - came out fresh and hot! Very healthy option to pick and it tasted very good.  We also ordered the Ham & Cheese Omelette - It came out hot and fresh and cheesy!   Didn't care for the hash browns. It was not crunchy and too soft for my liking.  The best part of all of this is that damn BACON!!! Get it on the side, it compliments with your meal or by its dang self. Very thick, smokey, and just amazingly delicious.",

When I walked in, there were quite a lot of people waiting for tables, so I automatically assumed it would be a long wait.  However, I was pleased to see that the wait was very short.  They had many staff members that were all working very hard and had great hospitality.  The place was clean and well organized.  I ordered a burger and fries and hot tea. All of the above were absolutely amazing!! One of the best burgers I've ever had, in fact!  I totally loved this place and will assuredly be back!!",

The portions are extremely small, the fries and fish were greasy and appear to look like and taste like the crap you get in the freezer section of the market.  The club sandwich was small and sad.  Not impressed.  The cole slaw was a half of the tiny container and dry.  The only thing good was my cut up fruit.  But how can you mess that up.  We ordered take out.  The cook was a Hispanic guy who didn't speak English.  Maybe that's where the problem is.  Maybe they need a better cook.  We wasted $40.00 tonight and we will never go back and will tell others to avoid this place.  Do yourself a favor and go any place but here.  It was truly disappointing and horrible.  We threw away most of the food.  It's busy here, so they must be getting the tourists who are used to eating subpar food.  As a local, I'm avoiding this place.  Update:   Here is a picture of the club sandwich on black bear diner website.     Does that even come close to what I got in take out ?",

    "text": "Went in this morning and couldn't be more disappointed. Took a minute to be seated which wasn't a problem. We ordered the bacon and egg breakfast with bacon crispy, and a Denver omelet plus 2 coffees. It took awhile for the food to come out, in the mean time we had both finished our coffee and no one had come by to refill. (Mind you the restaurant is NOT busy and at the most 1/4 full ) the food finally comes out and the manager basically dropped and ran, but we were able to ask for more coffee... I didn't have a chance to tell anyone that the bacon was NOT crispy. After waiting a minute and no one, and I mean no one who works there was in the dining room, I just decided to eat it. Waiting, waiting, waiting.... no coffee. I finally had to get up with both cups and walk to the front of the restaurant to ask for more coffee. I was given the reason as they got slammed. I know what slammed is, and this was no where close to being slammed. In fact most of the employees were keeping themselves busy doing a whole lot of nothing. Finally got more coffee!  At no time did anyone come by to see if we needed anything or if everything was ok. Because by this time it was realized that the omelet was over cooked and there was so much ham and nothing else on it that it was to the point of inedible.  While the manager apologized when we were leaving and I expressed my disappointment. He is a bit abrupt. When he asked if everything was good, I said no and his response was \"why\" not oh no what can I do, but Why! We will not be returning to this location. There are other locations in town that have far superior service",

We arrived just around 9AM on 12/26/17 only to find that it was slightly starting to get busy. We got a seat at the bar and was helped right away.   This place was definitely a traditional diner with mom and pop style food ... meaning portions were HUGE. The menu was creatively printed on newspaper, paper and folded like newspaper. Very cute!  I got the breakfast special which was steak and eggs that day. It also comes with potatoes and toast. I ordered my son the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of hash browns. My husband ordered one of the breakfast plates with a side of pancakes. His breakfast plate came with eggs, bacon, sausage and a biscuit.   Now let me tell you... these pancakes were the size of my head. They were huge! Delicious too! Everything tasted wonderfully! The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, eggs were delicious and the potatoes were more like a hash and it was probably my favorite to eat. My husband raved about his sausages - said they were the best sausage patties he had ever tasted!   Overall, we had a great experience. After we placed our order, service seemed to slow and it took longer than expected to get our food but that did not stop us from enjoying our time at Black Bear. If we are ever on the west coast, we will surely find a location to stop in!   ***Update: Just found out that Black Bear is coming to Katy, TEXAS! As native Houstonians, we will surely take the drive up to dine!",

When we first got here I was super happy to see they have a veggie burger! When I ordered I asked for it on no brioche bun and instead asked for a stirato bun and I also asked for no red onion, mayo, or thousand island dressing. Unfortunately, they served the burger on a brioche bun and it had red onion. They did make it without mayo or thousand island dressing. So I just ended up eating the patty only which was prepared very well! I think the problem was more with the server. She wasn't very attentive and personable and probably missed what I said about not having the brioche bun or red onion. This is just a guess though and I'm not sure where things went wrong, if it was the server or the cook. I understand why it happened since I know normally they make it on a brioche bun and with red onion. Still, it was a little disappointing. The music is also very loud and just overall things seem to be a little unorganized. I got a baked potato and it was HUGE and was good! Next time I think I'll just get a salad though...",

    "text": "This place was pretty good. We went to one in California last month and I liked it, so when a friend from out of town came in we decided to give the local one in Las Vegas a try. Luckily we went on a Sunday when it wasn't too crazy busy yet, you know how people love the Sunday breakfast! The service was good, and the food came out pretty fast.  I ordered the corned beef hash with my eggs over medium (which most places get it wrong and I have to send it back) and the eggs were done right, yay! The corned beef part of it was very chunky, a little dry for my taste though. If you're looking for a good diner with huge portions of comfort food, Black Bear Diner is a good recommendation. My out of town friends thought it was tasty, and the portions were so big that we all had leftovers to take home. That's always a good thing so you can enjoy your meal twice.",

You should share a plate if you wanna save room for dessert and we had the coconut cream pie and regretted that we didn't get more pie to go. It wasn't overly sweet and was a simple graham cracker crust. Everything had bear  paw  prints and images and we wanted to save our to go pie box and doggy bags, they were so cute.   Recommend the salad with the ranch dressing. The dressing is like Krispy Kreme icing crack...that good! So yum !! I ate all my veggies because of it. Their green beans were well cooked and not soggy with massive amounts of bacon .   Corn muffins accompanied the meal except for the a la Carte items (pot pie) of which I was snuck a muffin anyway.  Idk why that was pointed out. It should be provided for the table like regular bread baskets but I think my Carby entitlement is showing.",

I ordered the club and added cheese and avocado. It was delicious. The bread was toasted yet buttery and the slices of meat and cheese were nice and thick.   I also ordered the chicken pesto penne pasta and that was delicious. It had so much flavor but it was super filling.   Lastly, the penne Mac n cheese ...... it was very good.   The prices are good considering you get some hefty portions. This was my first time and I will be returning!   Ordered again last night, the meatloaf and mash potatoes are ah-mazing! The chicken soup even had so much flavor. I think I'll be here more than I should because so far they have yet to disappoint. My husband loves the onion rings!",

Breakfast is one of the best in town. My favorite is the California Benny. That is eggs Benedict with bacon instead of Canadian bacon with spinach, tomato with avocado added..A must try in my book!   You have a choice of going healthy with their fit and light menu option like my salmon photo I attached or comfort food like my husband open face Turkey..photo attached. Either way there's no going wrong. I highly recommend them. Oh and the dessert are all great!",

    "text": "I have past this location many times as I make my way to the El Salvadoran restaurant a few doors down. This restaurant seems packed all the time with people waiting outside. This morning my husband wanted to go out for brunch. As we were planning out our day, we figured we'd try Black Bear based on where we were going to run errands for the day.   As we expected, it was busy. But because of the size of the restaurant, wait time was only 20-minutes. The host was very nice and helpful. But two seats opened up at the counter sooner so we decided to take those seats and I wish we didn't.   We love the lodge-like atmosphere. We think the woodsy looking chairs are cute, the branding of black bears throughout the restaurant. My husband thought it was so cute they had their own  ketchup.   We also thought the food was good. My husband had the very large Big Bear breakfast that came with chicken fried steak, choice of red potatoes and pancakes. I decided on the small club sandwich which I was glad I did. Much more manageable to eat and I was able to finish it all. I chose onion rings over French fries.   Update Review 2/8/2019 Although I still stand behind that I felt that the service I received was far less than what I had expected, I wanted to update my review from my original post from 2/2/2019  It is apparent that someone from the restaurant read my review, talked to the server and the patron sitting next to me messaged me about my experience.  The conversation was cordial.  Turns out the couple sitting next to me are regulars and have befriended many of the staff members at the restaurant.  Thinking back, I believe this as I do recall upon leaving the counter that another server started to strike up a conversation with an elderly couple that had just sat down and had remembered their usual, \"you want me to get .... started for you?\"  For the regulars of this location, they've become part of the Black Bear family.  This I can respect.  Although I don't expect to ever make this a regular dining spot as this is not the type of comfort I grew up on, and although feeling like part of the family wasn't my experience, I'm more than happy to up this review to 4-stars on-behalf of all those that have had the 5-star experience.  Hopefully next time, I'll get to experience it for myself.  Review from 2/2/2019 So why the 2-star review? The server at the counter . Throughout the entire meal, she stood there and talked with her friends that happen to be patrons sitting next to us at the counter. It's just a habit for me that I don't interrupt people having a conversation. So for me to interrupt her while she should be working wasn't easy for me to do. And I thought, don't you think you should let your friends eat in peace while you WORK! She knew I was irritated with her. When it came time to take our order after waiting a long while, she all of a sudden became a fast and soft talker. WHAT DID YOU SAY MY OPTIONS ARE!? Oh! French fries, onions rings or sweet potato fries.  Geez!    Earlier when we first sat down, it seemed that one of the other severs was her husband as he told the couple next to us that they were going to their house tomorrow for super bowl and that they have babysitters for the kids. So all the talking you were doing, could've been down tomorrow?  Later, a woman sat on the other side of the couple. Guess who took her order? The counter server's husband. Who filled our water? The husband. And no, they are not the restaurant owners or managers as the couple wore the usual black t-shirt uniform while the manager wore a blue collared shirt.   This really should be at least a 4-star review but thanks to the lackluster counter server, this visit gets 2-stars.",

Enjoyed my breakfast and the service was great.  It was a little busy at 9am, but didn't take long to get waited on.    I ordered the avocado toast with two eggs on the side.

My order was the basic two eggs , sausage patty, red potato home fries. Here is where the meal gets better. The counter has a foot riser the likes I've never experienced before. It helped relax my back so the meal could be enjoyed. Great flavor, love the cumin in the sausage (Italian style) eggs were perfect over medium. Served in less than ten minutes! Black bear has a great order control system so I expect other diners to be challenged keeping up with this customer service challenge!!!  Highly recommended for breakfast!

We were seated almost immediately and our server Brett took our drink orders. We decided to split \"The Grizz\" and when our order came to our table, we were both relieved that we decided to split. The order came on two platters. One platter had 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausages, a ham steak, 3 eggs and potatoes on it. The other platter had two sweet cream pancakes bigger than my face. It was pretty impressive. Now, there's not much to say about bacon, eggs and ham. Those are pretty hard to mess up. The sausage was absolutely delicious and juicy! And the potatoes were season perfectly and served with bell pepper and onions. The star of the meal was definitely the pancakes! I will never attempt to make pancakes at home ever again! They were nice and fluffy and perfectly cooked. The dusting of powdered sugar with butter and syrup made it even more delicious!  Our server, Brett was very attentive and made sure our drinks never ran out.  We will definitely be back!",

Our wait time was about twenty minutes which was pretty good for a saturday morning. The reataurant is so cutely decortated with cute black bears, very woodsy feel. We took a look at the menu and it was great, so many choices to make. Our server was Sandor, he was awesome, he was super attentive and met our needs with a smile and a courtesy that is very hard to find. The food was on point and delicious. Tasted very fresh and came out fast. Our breakfast experience was great and will definitely recommend Black Bear Diner a million times over. Thank You!",

Neither of us had ever been to the Black  Bear Diner but decided to give it a go. We were greeted by a Jason who was so pleasant and welcoming..escorted to our table  and gave us our introduction to Black Bear and what makes it special. Our server \"Marcus\" was simply amazing...He was very friendly and had the best sense of humor (as we two old ladies can be a hand full). The food was plentiful and delicious and the service was above and beyond. Definitely will be visiting again it was so refreshing to have such a wonderful experience. Great food and thanks to Marcus fantastic service at such reasonable prices! It just made our \"adventure\" day even more fun!!!",

    "text": "The food at Black Bear is always good... No complaints there. The service is usually good but tonight, service was exceptionally bad at the outset! Our server was either not paying attention to her customers or she just didn't want to be there. We were seated fairly quickly, given menus and left to peruse the selections. When she finally returned to take our orders she repeated them back incorrectly. She corrected the mistake and walked away. She came back shortly to seat another couple in the booth behind us. She returned to them rather quickly and took their orders. Both my husband and I ordered burgers, cooked medium, asking to add pickles to mine. She told me they don't come with pickles. Ok. So then can I have them on the side? I asked for ranch for my onion rings and my hubby asked for blue cheese. She returned about 10 minutes later with a serving of blue cheese. I reminded her of my ranch... She left to serve other guests. Another five minutes or so passed and the Colville who arrived about 10 minutes after we did received their meals. When our burgers finally arrived, no ranch, no pickles. By this time, my husband had run out of water and put his cup out for a refill. My husband proceeded to take a bite of his burger. I cut mine in half only to find it very well done! Hubby asked how it looked and said his was over cooked. I told him mine was too. We tried to flag down our server but she was busy tending to other guests. We finally flagged down who we guessed was the manager on duty and informed him of the problem. He offered to have them remade. All this time, our server walked past us several times never once acknowledging us. When our burgers finally came, they were cooked perfectly. By this time our onion rings were gone and still no water. I only managed to eat half of my burger and was finally offered a box when she finally returned to refill the water (now that we were done with our meal) and bring our bill. I said \"yes, please\" to the offer for the box and she walked away. There was no mention at all of a \"thank you for coming in\". I'm not kidding... We waited another 10 minutes until I finally got up myself to find a box. There was another server nearby entering an order so I waited... Another server came walking up, clearly looking at me, mahjong eye contact, but as she got closer, she put her head down, making obvious efforts to look away and was gonna walk away until but I stopped her to politely ask for a box. She retrieved a box rather quickly, I packed up my food and we went to pay for our food. You'd think this was the end of it, but no!  The lady at the cash register finished helping the guests in front of us and waked away. Literally. She walked away! The manager, seeing us waiting, came to our \"rescue\". He asked about our experience and we responded briefly but honestly. He apologized and proceeded to ring up our $19.25 bill and gave us the receipt to sign. I proceeded to sign but stopped short when I noticed the total... $45 and change! Wait! What?!?!?! I said \"excuse me, why is my bill $45+ when it was $19.25 on the first receipt?\" He noticed the mistake of not removing the first burgers that were cooked impropererly and double billed us. By this time, our bank account had been charged $45+!  He apologized and said that he deducted the two burgers and add a courtesy, removed the charge for the bear claw too!!! Uhh... What bear claw? We didn't have a bear claw!!!! Wow!  What the heck???  He did finally offer us a bear claw but we declined. We just wanted to get out of there!  This was almost dinner hour but not even a quarter of the restaurant was full... Maybe guests at 5-6 tables at the most!!! I tell you, we love Black Bear... We were so excited to have one near... But we'll definitely think twice before visiting this particular location. Sorry Black Bear... But we really expect much better service from you.",

We were greeted, seated and had drinks in less than 3 minutes on a busy Saturday morning.  You can choose between counter service, table or a booth for seating.  Fresh brewed coffee and iced tea. They had different flavors of creamer for the coffee, we had the French vanilla.  I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast...YUM! I wish I had room for another order. I had agreed to share before the food came and I wish I hadn't because it was so good. It doesn't really need the syrup, but it tastes good on top. Bacon was cooked perfectly.  My guy got the big bear (10oz) chicken fried steak, red potatoes and biscuits for his over easy eggs. Chicken fried steak was great. We doctored the gravy a bit to add more flavor. Eggs were cooked correctly and the red potatoes with veggies were great.  Our server Angela was very attentive and took great care of us, we never had a need for anything.  We WILL be back!",

Just wished there was more sitting space while you wait. My husband ordered The Scrambowl which is an all-in-one bowl of ham, bacon, linked sausages, eggs, bell peppers, onions, pickled jalapeno peppers and scrambled potatoes topped with cheddar cheese and country gravy. Served with biscuits. I ordered Cinnamon Roll French Toast (which is made of 3 slices of thick Cinnamon Rolls dipped in French Toast Batter) with sausages and eggs. Although next time, I'll just have the CRFT!  Both dishes were delicious and highly recommended!!! The price was good and portions are huge. Our server was good. However the place can be tidier and cleaner. Since it was so busy there are scraps on the floor and tables are not too tidy.",

My juicer at home broke years ago but the taste of that OJ made me buy another one. Forgot how good natural OJ tasted. The hash browns were to die for. This place is so good. We (obviously) will be coming back. Compared to big chains like IHOP & Denny's, it's less expensive and tastes way better.",

When we first arrived, it was about a 20 - 35 minute wait, which was fine. Although I will say, we did show up rather late. It was almost noon on a Saturday.   When we got our table, we looked over the menu for about 3 - 5 minutes before my husband asked another server if we could have our waitress, and that was just to order our drinks. Once we ordered our food, we didn't anticipate our food coming out immediately.  Like the other BBD, the food here is great. I ordered the New York Steak and my husband ordered the Grizz, both were delicious and filling. Our waitress stopped by a few times to make sure everything was good, so that was nice. Unfortunately, when we finished eating, it took 20 minutes to get two to-go boxes and our check.  All in all, the experience here wasn't horrible, but I think my husband and I will stick with the green valley location. If you do decide to try this location, I'd suggest maybe coming a lot earlier, unless you don't mind the wait. Again, it was practically lunch time when we arrived.",

When we went to go pay at the front he took our receipt and he still said nothing and didn't give us any kind of apology or offer to discount the meal. We also heard the employees talking and you could clearly sense that there are some issues going in there. Bad vibes!",

I had the loaded macaroni and cheese with garlic toast and any other side that I want , my wife had the steak and eggs special and my kids had the special where you can get biscuits or pancakes with eggs and hash brown. All the food was flavorful and good. But I have to admit the experience was all tied together all because of a sweet green eye woman who was very helpful , made the menu really easy to understand her name is Ashley and she was the best waitress I ever had.Very down-to-earth, very sweet and kind if you go to Black Bear Diner on Las Vegas blvd ask for Ashley she is the best!",

Chicken done very well served HELLA HOT, burn your tongue hot and that's how I like it. The waffle was very cake like and the syrup that they used is heated so that was nice (10/10). Also tried some tomato basil soup that was pretty good nice hearty seasoning (8/10). The deserts are a great deal you get a mini pie for like 5 dollars with ice cream... spot will definitely get you feed.   Overall, full as fuck.",

My sense of this place is they know that they have a great product, and that they do, so they let the service suffer. The mistake they have made is they may not be aware that they are in Las Vegas, not California. I was asked by the server if I knew what I wanted, before she had given me a menu. I saw a server complain that a customer was upset because they had tp wait over 45 minuses for their food. OK now that the unpleasantness is out of the way. The corned beef hash was fantastic. So if you don't care about being treated like a valued customer then by all means stop in. If not; there are plenty other diners in the sea. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",

    "text": "The Black Bear Diner chain just lost four customers and all of our military and veteran friends.  It really pains me to give any Black Bear Diner such a low rating, but they can thank the male manager on duty during the morning shift on 2/24/18 for taking what would have been a solid three stars to one star and for losing ALL of my future business.  I love the Tropicana location.  The Sahara location is one of my favorites.   I've never had an issue until this visit. Black Bear was always on the top of my recommendation list for my out of town guests.  Short version - Manager wanted to argue over 10% military/veteran discount and told me he will make sure that he tells all of the Las Vegas Valley stores to stop providing such discount.  His reasons for not wanting to provide it were ridiculous and some are provided below.    This location is always very busy, especially on the weekends.  There were four of us (two military veterans and spouses) and the wait was not terrible.  We were seated within 15 minutes and had a great server named Yessenia take care of our table.  She did a fantastic job and took care of all our needs efficiently.  The food was ok.  A little flavorless compared to the other locations, but not unsatisfactory.  The problem started when the check came.  I had just visited the Sahara location on 2/18 with my husband who always inquires about a military/veteran discount.  We try to patronize the places that do so and encourage our veteran and military friends to do the same. Often times we kick the difference back to our server on top of what the full price tip would be when we get good service.  The Sahara location gladly offered it to us and stated it is 10%.  Our dining companions also made note that they have received a discount at locations in Utah, Oregon, and California.  When our table asked, we were told no by the person who brought the check, who was not our server.  When our friend asked for them to double check, we then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes and no one came back.  I took the check up to the cashier and asked again and was told she didn't know.  I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager said that Black Bear does not offer a discount to anyone.  I told him I was at the Sahara store less than a week ago and there was a veteran discount.I explained that we got good service and it would allow me to tip extra to Yessenia.  Our friends also expressed that they have received the same discount at all other locations.  This started out benign but then he claimed the following:  - No one in the chain does it. Ever. - But then claimed he gives \"them\" (other stores?) leeway to do so based on location.  Or if they feel they should give it to the veteran. - He says if they are close to a base they can do it.  Then tells me that he allows it in St. George, UT and Layton, UT.    Last time I checked, Nellis AFB is here and a hell of a lot closer than St. George. - He said he would make sure he lets \"all of his stores here\" know to stop offering it.  I told him that I'd be glad to let all of our military and veteran friends know to stop visiting.   He begrudgingly gave me the 10% off which I did indeed tip back to our great server.  I hope she sees this and considers finding a better work environment because her manager's attitude could definitely cut into her money.  I hope Black Bear Diner will also see this and check into what is happening in their stores.  I also hope the young soldier who was less than 10 feet away from the cashier stand heard this and decided to go elsewhere.",

The pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They are made with sweet cream and don't require a ton of syrup. They are fluffy and have the perfect texture. We also had a biscuit which was huge! Fluffy and so, so good! The staff are fast, polite and work incredibly well together. They turn tables quickly and efficiently.

I had the California omelet with nice fresh mushrooms but only a small piece of sliced avocado on top. Didn't realize they were a chain because we live in the east and they only exit out west. It's tough to compete with our experiences in NJ diners which are much better and quite a bit cheaper.",

They said they had no to go orders in the system. Then after i told them what i wanted they were like ohhh.. yeah so the order just never got rang in. Then after the cashier walked over and told them to make it to go right after she sent the order they still made it for there. When she asked them to make it to go AGAIN, they sounded irritated. And just threw it in the box. The eggs Benedict are flipped over egg broke as if they didn't care. And no i didn't swing the bag around. This was right after receiving my food. I'm hoping it was just an off day but it kinda turned me away from my favorite place the only good thing was the cashier that was very sweet and tried to have it made as fast as possible.",

I just sat down to eat my lunch as I worked and the sandwich is wrong and I just find this such a frustrating situation.  One cheese, not the two I was charged for.  Mustard heavy mayo light.  I couldn't locate a local phone number so I called one of the other 3 and was told they couldn't give me the number but I could locate it online.  I explained I had just attempted to find it on the Internet and couldn't find the number.  Still referred to online.  $14.00 sandwiches need to be correct.  This is my second bad experience at a Las Vegas Black Bear.  Expansion is great but your service level should not suffer.  Too bad they haven't learned this lesson.",

The staff at the Vegas location did not have good hospitality. They need to brush up on common courtesy like saying please and thank you.  I ordered the standard Eggs Benedict. The meal was good. I was asked if I want regular hash browns or the diced red potatoes. I ordered the regular hash browns. When I received my meal they gave me the red potatoes. I did not send them back I just ate what they gave me. They were actually pretty good, it was just I did not order them. My wife ordered the Club Eggs Benedict that is a seasonal item. They totally messed up that one. The meal was missing the bacon and tomatoes. The waitress never came by to check up on how we liked the food. It was just order and drop off. My wife just ate the food and just made the best of it. When I went to pay the bill the cashier was equally inattentive and lacked manners. The cashier did not use manners even after I was being polite and said thank you. Besides not being happy with service, the food was actually pretty good at Black Bear. It is too-bad this location is allowing their staff to be inattentive to customers.",

The server came right away and once I explained we had never been there before she took her time to explain the menu, answer questions and offer suggestions.  She even accommodated my special requests for no extra chanrge. The food was awesome. So so Good. Would recommend the California omelette with hashbrowns. Delectable.  Will be back. Great breakfast spot.",

Food is pretty much the same as the other locations, but i felt they were lacking the service. It wasn't as busy that evening we went for dinner. It took awhile before the waiter came by to take our orders, and we would have to ask for to refill water every now and then. We had order the special on the menu that evening, the fish fry and its unlimited but we had to ask for it, when at other locations they would ask if we would like any more. Over all it was an okay visit, but i would have expected a little more after visiting the other locations many times. Hopefully the next time i return it will get a better!",

    "text": "My  family and I and our friends just had dinner here. I must say, very very disappointing! I don't even know where to start. First off our server was to be desired, she wasn't very attentive and was a little on the rude/short side. First issue with our food is that as I was eating my corn muffin I went to pick up a piece and noticed a dark hair literally baked into the muffin itself. Second issue is that they brought out the entire tables food except for my oldest son's dinner. When my son said something the server claimed it was 'still on the grill'. It took 15 minutes before they brought his food out. That too me is a sign that they forgot his order altogether. Third issue was that the food was very subpar. My wife's green beans looked gross and tasted like they looked. My country fried steak seasoning was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. And the mini corn dogs for my other sons were over cooked and hard to eat. I asked to speak to the manager at the register and she acted annoyed that I was bothering her with our issues and at one point appeared to roll her eyes. For being a new location we had higher hopes but was let down. We will not be back!",

The pancakes are not your typical buttermilk, they are much sweeter and fluffier, but completely delicious. Eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly. Would have been 5 stars, but on a busy Sunday morning, we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. 35 minutes later, after noticing people getting called back who had arrived after us, I checked on our wait only to find out they had completely skipped over our name and called like 6 people back ahead of us. We only got a half-ass apology as well. Service could be improved, but the food speaks for itself.",
