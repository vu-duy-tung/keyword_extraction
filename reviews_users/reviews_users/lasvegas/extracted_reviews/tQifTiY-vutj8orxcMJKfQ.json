It has a fun mafia style vibe rather than that stuffy expensive steakhouse ambiance. I love how the booths are separated by partial walls & the service & attitude is always so welcoming & friendly! It doesn't hurt that they're next door to Hogs & Heifers so the ladies can go dance their dinner off on the bar afterwards!!!!",

    "text": "This is the real steakhouse experience at an affordable price.  Great private booths, friendly and helpful wait-staff, and delicious food. Prices aren't cheap, but they are quite reasonable - you can spend a lot more at one of the tony places on the Strip. I had the 16 oz (boneless) ribeye and it was flavorful, well-marbled, and an honest 16 ounces.  My wife had an Ahi steak, which she really enjoyed.  The Chopped George salad and their Caesar salad are my favorites for openers. The wine list is good, with plenty of reasonable (and high-end) wines. Be sure to have a reservation.  We showed up on Friday night for our 8:15pm reservation and were immediately seated, while there was quite a line of walk-in customers.  I have been at many other places where a reservation just gets you a better spot in line, but here it was honored immediately.",

With that being said they don't look down their snout at you for coming in in your pool attire! Stopping by after going to the pool is a must for us. It's a plus that their happy hour goes until 7 p.m. As most of them in Freemont Street area only go till 6 p.m. And if you like to hang out at the pool until all of the sunshine is gone then the later time is ideal. I like the goat cheese appetizer and my wife really likes the fish sliders. It's very high quality food at a very reasonable price you can't beat this place! And Shelby was very attentive and professional as was everyone that talked to us. And it's always been that way every time we've went in. We're definitely going back soon to have lunch or dinner!",

You may be dining very closely with the next table so it can feel a little bit claustrophobic.   I ordered the vegan ravioli. The other people I was with ordered one of the burgers and the meatloaf . They all liked it a lot and wanted to come back. As for my ravioli, it was delicious, albeit being a little heavy and creamy.   Not sure if I will be back on my own free will. The food is good but not something I crave for.",

The ladies had chicken pot pie (huge) and said it was delicious. The gentlemen had the Chef's special Halibut. I found mine a little dry, but I cleaned the plate. The vegetables and wild rice were good. The manager checked with us twice. The staff made it convenient to accommodate one of our guests in a wheelchair. The location is a convenient short walk to The Fremont Experience. Parking was not provided next to the restaurant. It was no problem for us since we went to the wonderful  #Frankie Moreno concert afterwards at the #Golden Nugget. The Golden Nugget gave us valet parking and has a parking garage nearby.",

We had Monique as our server, fabulous from the get go, great service and always had a smile on her face. We ordered off the menu and had a little bit of everything from steak, pasta, and even a burger as well as appetizers. Everyone said their food was GREAT! We had brought a few bottles of wine and Monique chilled them for us before opening. Corkage was $25 a bottle which in Vegas is a steal! I will definitely be back to Triple George!",

    "text": "I had always wanted to visit the Triple George, so I took Ross on an official date  I did have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, but only for $25 or so.  We walked in the Triple George and were greeted and seated immediately.  We scored a secluded booth and they immediately brought the wine list, took our drink orders and placed a relish tray on the table.  We nibbled on carrots, pickles and other goodies as we perused the menu.  The waiter brought my coffee and it was a big cup, perfect size and shape and the coffee was hot and very tasty.  We ordered the Baked Goat Cheese Marinara, and it was a log of soft goat cheese, floating in a bath of marina sauce, served with crispy garlic bread.  Delish!  Very similar to a dish we get back home at a local chain, if you can believe that!  Ross started with the French Onion Soup and I opted for the Caesar Salad.  They put bacon in it, and that slightly detracted from the traditional taste, making it almost too salty.  The waiter was quick with refills and the dirty dishes were cleared quickly.    For my entree, I selected the Chicken Pot Pie - the phrase 'sherry herb cream sauce' grabbed me and wouldn't let go!  The dish was massive!  It had a very flaky 'lid' (if you will) of pastry atop a large bowl of steaming pot pie.  The chicken breast meat was in large, tender chunks, accompanied by baby onions, still-crisp peas and carrots and the occasional mushroom.  The sauce was velvety and delicious - I was so disappointed I had no way to eat more or take it for later!  Ross ordered the porcini-crusted ribeye, with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  His steak was just the right temperature, pan-seared and cooked perfectly to medium rare and had just enough of a spice to make any additional salt or pepper unnecessary.  The potatoes were smooth and creamy, with a hint of garlic and the veggies were crispy and fresh.  We finished the dinner with Creme Brulee, which was the smoothest, most yummy rendition of this we'd ever had.  The sugar top was perfectly caramelized and the custard was velvety and melted in your mouth.  This is seriously one of the better dining experiences we've had, both in terms of food quality and service, and it fits just about any budget.  Definitely worth taking a side trip next time you're in the area!",

I honestly felt like I was dining at a 5-Star, 5-Diamond restaurant. The server and waiter were both very knowledgeable about the menu, were friendly while talking to us, and catered to our every need. Our table's glasses were never empty, and whatever we asked for was given to us immediately.

    "text": "Located right next to the Grand, Triple George is a great place downtown to grab a bite. It's a short walk from Fremont Street, so it is easily accessible if you're in that area.  I came here on a Thursday evening with two girlfriends for a late night dinner.  Not very many people in, so they were very accommodating, and sat us immediately.  We started off with drinks.  We each had dirty martinis--so good!  The blue cheese stuffed olives (order extra ;)) were a beautiful compliment to the perfectly shaken martini.  The table bread was warm, crusty, and delicious.  We ordered the baked goat cheese marinara as an appetizer; it's served with garlic toasted crusty bread.  Delicious!  I swear I could eat the whole thing.    For entrees we ordered the porcini crusted rib eye (medium rare), the shrimp george, and the vegan chicken marsala (yes--they have a vegan menu and it's pretty sweet!).  We all shared, and everything was great, particular the shrimp george.  It's stuffed with crab and served with a lemon butter sauce, veggies and rice pilaf.  Very tasty!  The porcini crusted rib eye was also very good--not the best I've ever had, but definitely satisfying.  I love the fact that they had a vegan menu.  One of my girlfriends is vegetarian, so it's great to find places that cater to her peoples ;) And I'm not gonna lie their vegan menu ain't half bad!  The vegan chicken marsala was DEE-lish!   Our server was prompt and sweet.  He noticed it was mine and my girlfriend's birthdays, and he brought over chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  If I weren't so full, I would have polished this off haha! But yeah, it was definitely a satisfying evening.  The bill came out to approximately $50 each, with tip included.  Not bad for all the food we got.  Triple George is high up on my list for the many great downtown eateries!",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to a birthday dinner here while on a trip to Vegas. However, we were a little disappointed. We order steak and lobster which was one of the higher ticket items. The lobster was undercooked and there's nothing less appetizing than undercooked shellfish. Also, my husband's vegetable side dish was ice cold. Mine was cool but his was refrigerator cold. He sent his back but I was starving so I didn't. The steak was tasty though and so was my french onion soup. Maybe they were just having an off night but for the price I expected more.",

Our waitress, Cecilia was so friendly and accommodating despite our shenanigans, she made our experience all the more enjoyable (give her a raise/bonus). The ambience and feel of the overall restaurant was nice (classy), but not suffocating or uncomfortable for casual wear. Now onto the food...quite honestly, my friends and I weren't expecting anything grand which may be why it far exceeded any expectations we had. The food was absolutely delicious. From the chicken Christopher to the filet mignon to the blackened salmon to the fried chicken, everything was ON POINT! We are definitely coming back whenever we're in sin city.",

A 40's style bar/pub is a change in scenery from the normal \"gourmet\" type of eateries we see. Black and white photos on the walls solidify the 40's feel.  I order the fish and chips. It's good, legit fish and chips - think English or Irish pub. The dill sauce with the chips is pretty amazing and the malt vinegar they provide is spot-on.   Club sandwich and any burger (pick one) are also delicious, or ask the staff for specials or their own personal favorites.   The service is wonderful, and even the bar keeps are on their toes waiting for your requests. Service is prompt and friendly, and the good prices are fair for the portions. I can guarantee that if you like pub fare, you will not be disappointed here.",

When we asked our waitress said she would go check and the manager brought the food out a short time later. The food was lukewarm and my friend's burger was not cooked properly and was dry. Our waitress said she would get the manager and disappeared. The manager apologized and was very polite. He told us he would send out waitress back out to get a free dessert. She dropped the dessert menu off and disappeared for another 10 minutes. They were not busy, so I'm not sure where she was going when she disappeared. We finally just asked for our check. When the manager found out that we never got to order dessert he comped our drinks and appetizer. We were pleased that the manager tried to make things right, but were disappointed by the service we got from our waitress. The food was ok, but not spectacular.",

Two of us had a salad, I chose the wedge salad w ranch dressing, so yummy and fresh. My best friend had the chopped salad, yummy as well. My sister had the clam chowder - so good as well.  My main entree was the 6oz filet w lobster. Omg. So good. My best friend had the salmon and she said it was the best salmon she has ever eaten. My sister and best friends wife had steak as well - and both commented how good it was as well. All of us had the mashed potatoes and this was a great choice as well.

It wasn't anything too fancy; it reminded me of a golf country club restaurant, classy with tv's playing sports.  Their wild mushroom side was great. Their brussel sprouts come with bacon - FYI. It was fine by me, not my husband. They overlooked their asparagus, a shame.  Their bernaise (sp?) sauce, not so great. Peppercorn crust... Delish!!  Very nice staff!

We dined January 27th (party of 12) at 7pm. We never got our waiters name and considering we only saw him twice through our rushed 1.5 hour dinner, we didn't get a chance to even ask.  Upon arrival we were a tad early so Andy and i grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a few glasses of wine. The experience we had at the bar was our first red flag. The bartenders were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Given it was pretty busy but if you're a high volume bartender it shouldn't have been so difficult to handle. The older woman who greeted us about 10 minutes after we sat took our drink order and came back to slam down the wines and quickly ran off.   We were pretty annoyed with the nature of this so we went next door to Hogs to grab a drink while waiting for our party. Once everyone arrived we were seated. About 15 minutes after seating we flagged down a bus boy and asked him if we could get our waiter. another 10 minutes went by and he finally showed up. He took our orders and quickly ran off. we sat there without drinks until our food came. When we reminded him of our drink order he disappeared (again) Our drinks came out when we were finishing up our food.  Andy and i shared the crab, lobster and truffle fries. The truffle fries never made it to the table to we just enjoyed the crab and lobster which were both phenomenal.   I really wanted to like this place. I cant even begin to say how excited I was to dine here and celebrate my birthday. What a waste.",

I found the place on Yelp, called & made reservations for that Sunday at 4pm, which seemed stranger for a Sunday & a holiday that their weekend hours are 4-10pm..  Got there early about 3:55, we walked up to others standing outside because they weren't open yet, which was fine I guess. 4pm, they unlock the doors, the hostess asks if we reserved outdoor seating, ummmmm no!   So we got seated inside & ordered drinks, appetizers, & main courses. Our waitress was polite & friendly. My drink wasn't the greatest, my calamari was just OK, my New York strip was TOUGH & TASTELESS!!! It tasted like a Red Lobster steak (not good). My son ordered a NY strip as well and barely touched his too he flat out said it was nasty. I doctored mine up with salt, but still wasn't impressed.   My husband & grandfather had the pot roast. Hubby said his was bland too. My grandmother had the shrimp scampi which her & my daughter shared & they devoured it, guess it was good. Lol  I probably wouldn't go bk especially when there are a million other places to try in this city.",

The ambiance is nice, the staff friendly, and the lighting is desirable for a \"slightly noisier than usual\" meal.  My wife had the spicy linguine with scallops and shrimp.  The shrimp were fine (a little over cooked) the linguine was tasty but the scallops were soft and uninteresting...they swore they were dry scallops but they sure tasted like wet( wet scallops are injected with a solution to extend their shelf life and lose texture).  I had a very tough Hangar steak that I should have sent back..over seared and black, their steak knife had quite a tussle to get through for a couple of bites.  Based upon the above I might come back for an appetizer but not for a meal.",

I wanted something light and the French onion soup and George's Chopped Salad were perfect.    The restaurant was a nice, quieter change from this raucous part of town.  Even though I was a single person who didn't order very much, the server was attentive and cheerful.  I sat near where the meals were brought out of the kitchen, so got to view most everything as the waiters turned the corner.  All looked delicious, and I especially wish I had had room for dessert!",

I'm not sure why but they have changed their menu.   Removing several of the dishes we enjoyed including my favorite the mussels.  But that wasn't the must disappointing thing - my friend and both both decided on the burger.  Asking for it without a bun and wanting veggies or a salad instead of the frys that come with it.  Like a lot of people we are both watching carb intake.  We were just flat out told no.  They would not substitute anything for the French frys.  I was willing to pay a upcharge for a salad but was told no, not possible.  $18 is a lot of pay for a plain burger patty.  Sadly this is most likely my last visit there.  There are plenty of restaurant willing to work with their customers on their dietary requests.  No need to go to one who won't.",

I always assumed it was a carnivorous type establishment, but the first time we came (about 3 weeks ago) I was asking the waitress some questions about vegan-izing up my order and she caught on and asked if I'd like to see the vegan menu.  Vegan Menu?!?! Heck yes!!!  So on last nights visit I asked for the vegan menu again, and although I ordered the same thing I had the first time, still was delighted that they have other vegan options! I had the balsamic veggies w wild rice btw-very tasty and a good sized portion. The bread is also delicious and the dipping oil/dressing is savory & yummy!  We had a few glasses of wine..Piatelli Malbec for the win.  A great dinner yet again..thanks Triple George!",

The third sign: we order an appetizer & salads & order the Tomahawk steak on his recommendation. Our salads arrive and we have had them for 7 minutes when: THE STEAK ARRIVES! Are you kidding me?  The appetizer never arrives, Mo blames the chef,the assistant manager arrives & does not apologize. He just says this shouldn't have happened. The manager then comes to the table & says he will give us a free dessert! Umm, no.  Mo brings the bill to us and they took $60 off a $300 bill. Then he starts negotiating the markdown. Finally they took $100 off the bill.  They may try to present themselves as being a 3-Star Restaurant but they are far from it. The only apology was from the water guy. Skip this place & go to Oscar's @ The Plaza Casino. We went there for dessert & it was the best.",

My husband and I had a reservation for Valentines Day and decided to go with the special menu they were offering for $99 a couple.   Items ordered:  -Bisque of Love (lobster meat) -Be Mine Cocktail (shrimp cocktail)  -Bow N Arrow (twin stuffed lobster tail w/mashed potatoes/asparagus)  -Fall in Love Duo (lava cake/ice cream/chocolate covered strawberries)  All of the food had good flavor but I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. They were a bit too runny for my liking, they didn't taste fresh, and kind of tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The lobster was on the tough side. I really had to get in there with my steak knife, at one point I thought it was going to fly across the room because I was being so aggressive trying to cut into it. The dessert was amazing but by the time we received it, the ice cream on top of the lava cake was already melting and had formed a pool of ice cream on the plate. I did not get full off of the dishes we ordered. We went someplace else to eat afterwards. Price vs. amount of food was not justifiable. I should have stuck to the regular menu. We could have had a better, cheaper meal..   Our server Brenda was really nice. My husband ordered the beef tartare without knowing what it was, shame on him. He refused to eat it when it was brought out and Brenda was kind enough to switch it out for the shrimp cocktail, she was very attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal. I will be back again because I really want to try the pot roast, but until then they get 3 stars from me because of our very friendly server and great atmosphere.",

It was heaven!! And the edible flower was a fun treat!!   Our table ordered salads to start. The blue cheese was light and delicious. We ordered steaks, fish, chicken and mushroom ravioli. Pleasing a party of 9 is a difficult feat and they did just that. It wasn't the best food we've had in Vegas, but it was good.  We finished our meal with a trio of desserts... Creme Brulee, Chocolate cake, carrot cake... They were all good but the table favorites were the creme brulee and carrot cake.   I'll for sure visit this place again.

In a mood to celebrate, he ordered a 6oz filet and added on King crab legs for 25.95. The disappointment came when his dinner arrived with this lonely crab leg! We flagged the server who said \"i don't make the prices, but I'll talk to the chef.\" A manager came over and explained what market price meant to us, and conceded that \"they don't normally do this,\" but they'd give him another crab leg. I hate to give up the cioppino, but will probably not bring guests back.",

We had the special - grilled ahi and shrimp George.  When our bill ended up being $10 more than it should be the waitress told us there was an up charge of $3.75 for the bleu cheese mashed potatoes (versus the regular mashed potatoes that came with the entree) and that their software \"ghosts\" the up charge.  It still ended up being $5 more than it should have been.  Bottom line, great food, great service and great ambiance.  Just watch that bill!",

The only reason I give it a 3 instead of 4 is the way they were doing the happy hour. We sat out side of the restaurant and the waiter said the only way to the get the happy hour price is that we have to either sit inside at the bar or sit outside in front of Sidebar, which is only 10 feet away. We were completely confused by that rule because it made no sense at all.  Anyways, great neighborhood cafe, definitely worth the happy hour just make sure to sit in the right section.",

I had the petite filet and rice pilaf. The filet was cooked perfectly and was a great steak. A little pricey, but thats ok for such a classy little place. The Staff was totally on top of things, but maybe thats because it was very empty in there. Either way, our waiter was great. I am surprised that a nice little place like this was so dead on a Friday evening with it being just steps from the chaos that is Fremont street. I guess the tourists are more interested in shrimp cocktails and drinking large beers out of football shaped plastic glasses...well, thats fine with me. Its nice to have good places to eat that are not overrun by tourists and drunk twenty somethings.",

Sure, Vegas was busy this last weekend but hey - they had a table for us in less than 5 minutes since we called ahead. It's too bad we only got the table and no service. The food smelled incredible but we were never given the opportunity to even place an order. The Ass't General Manager had someone seat us and after we complained, he offered to pay for a meal for us but since we had tried to waive down service for awhile and received blank stares and snubbed looks, we were not in the mood to be treated like 2nd class any longer. Instead, my partner and I went across to Fremont Hotel to their steakhouse and spent $120 there.  It was DELICIOUS and the service was impeccable. Hey, I tried giving my money to the \"little guy\" and even used Yelp to find George's too...",

It's dark & upscale with a more relaxed front room with bar seating and a more formal back room with tables. The waiter was exceedingly attentive and friendly - smiled a lot - but didn't seem comfortable in his role - just wasn't genuine or really connecting. Glasses of wine range from $8 to $14? - I wasn't impressed with the $8 glasses (Greystone). My friend's salted caramel martini was really good. They started us out with some tasty bread with a delicious butter in balsamic vinegar/salt deal. The menu was filled with all the steak and seafood dishes you dream about. The entrees range from $13 to $45? - pretty pricey. My mushroom ravioli was very tasty and rich. My friends also got a decadent chocolate dessert that was very good. I didn't mind the price of the entrees as much (at least there was a range) but paying nearly $10 for a glass of cheap wine pisses me off.",

The hostess was very friendly.  We sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table, which she apologized profusely for the customers ahead of us not leaving yet, and continued to update us over the next 10-15 minutes on the status of our table.  It was fine, we were happy to have a drink and talk to the bartender.  He was extremely friendly and gave great wine suggestions.  The other bartender made my drink, a lemon drop martini, which I am a connoisseur of, and it was absolutely delicious.    We got our table shortly, a beautiful private booth.  Atmosphere was great.  Lighting was warm, decor contemporary but homey at the same time.  I like how they incorporated subway tile into the floor, but it didn't look grimey or gross like it can sometimes.  Very classical and fit the motif well.  In the booth, you feel like you're the only ones in the restaurant.      We ordered champagne, a little overpriced for Korbel (ugh, I hate paying $28 for a bottle of champagne in a restaurant that I would pay less than $10 for in the store). There was a decent selection of wines and a full stocked bar.    I ordered the wedge salad--highly recommend. Came with a HUGE chunk of fresh blue cheese, and it was sizable.  My fiance ordered ordered a caesar salad, and said it was the best caesar salad he's ever had.  And he's not much of a foodie.  Server was quick.  A little less chatty than the bartender, but she was efficient.        I also ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca and he got the Seared tuna.  we were in heaven.   The chicken was in more of a marsala sauce, which I love (and their's was terrificly sauced), but I'm not sure I'd call it saltimbocca.  He thoroughly enjoyed his Tuna.  The mashed potatoes I had were real and full of flavor and the vegetables on the side were a big highlight too.  Freshly cooked carrots and green beans.  We closed out the restaurant.  It was a terrific meal, price was a little high, but definitely worth it.  Our bill came to about $100, but for portion size and what we got?  We were stuffed.  I had to go back to the hotel and take a food nap after.  We also went to the eiffel tower restaurant previously and paid waaaay more for food that was severely under portioned and meh.  I will go back here in a heartbeat.  In fact, maybe every time we go to Vegas.  Bartender highly recommends the porcini crusted ribeye.  Sounded delicious, but we weren't in steak moods.  I will be trying that next time.  :)  Thanks Triple George for a wonderful meal!",

I had the New York Steak (Baked Potato & Vegetables) my wife had the Shrimp Scampi (Mashed Potato & Vegetables). The place is a great value and is in good location, close to the Fremont Street Experience. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "Can't rave enough about how freaking amazing Triple George is! I have been to Vegas twice in the past month and have eaten here on 3 occasions, back to back on one visit!! The food is amazing and to die for. The prices are absolutely phenomenal, I cant speak highly enough about this restaurant! The martini's are some of the best we have ever had, try the espresso martini for something new and different. If you are looking for an amazing appetizer order the baked goat cheese marinara, it will literally melt in your mouth. The porcini crusted rib eye steak is one of the best steaks I have ever had, it is the perfect balance, and the mashed potatoes are nice, light and airy, and the portions are served with grilled vegetables as well. You cannot go wrong ever at Triple George and you owe it to yourself to eat here.. Do yourself a favor and leave the Strip for two hours and take a ride downtown to eat here..",

The waiters make good suggestions to those who do not know what they want and even though we've gone in large groups the food tends to come out quickly.  My favorite dish is the pot roast. It tastes amazing! And it's served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and mixed vegetables (usually green beans and carrots.) Hands-down this is what I would suggest to somebody coming here. Since, it's part of the lunch specials it's only $9.95 so it's a great way to go.   I would definitely come back and I would suggest it to anybody especially for lunch. Oh yeah FYI- the lunch crowd is in full thing by noon so you may want to go around 11 o'clock (otherwise good luck getting a table.)",

The hostess wasn't very friendly and took her awhile to find my name on the reservations chart. I figured it was busy and she was probably having a bad day so I let it fly.....    We got seated in the back away from the bar, it was very quiet and dark and they had about 3-4 flat screen TV's playing on a large brick wall. Our waiter came over quickly and took our drink orders and he was very professional and gave us a great description of their specials that night. We had already looked at the menu beforehand so we put in our order right away. Our drinks came fast and prompt and we were given a basket of complimentary sourdough bread. It was DELICIOUS! nice and warm and crunchy....so far, so good.  I was really digging the atmosphere, I thought it would be loud and rowdy being that we were seated so close to the Hogs & Heffers bar right next door, but surprisingly it was quite romantic.  We ordered house salad's to start, they were fantastic. I am kind of a salad snob and was very pleased. I loved that they served it with a thin sliced cucumber instead of thick round pieces, the croutons were delish and the ranch dressing was very very good. I almost licked the plate LOL!  Soon after we got our main entree's,  I decided to try the Seafood Cioppino and it was amazing!  you def. get what you pay for with this dish, it was huge. The seafood was very fresh (shrimp and scallops were my fave) and the tomato broth was great and went well with the baguette they serve it with. I was very pleased!  My boyfriend decided to get the Ribeye medium well. He said it was really good and came with smashed butter potatoes and vegetables. He said the smashed potatoes were the best he ever had!   We finished off the night with a slice of cheesecake with raspberry fruit topping and boy was it worth it.  I am so glad we decided to come here and cannot wait to go back and try all the other delectable items on the menu!  Triple George Grill you ROCK!  =)",

    "text": "I have to say that my limited experience with Triple George Grill has left a horrible taste in my mouth. While the food was delicious, the service was horrible, especially for the price you pay.  I made reservations for my December 2012 wedding in April 2012 on the recommendation of a family member.    When I went to scope it out during September, they treated my group like crap.  We were a group of about a dozen bikers in town for Bike Week.  We were pleasant and ordered a lot of food a drinks, but the waitress apparently did not like us being in her section.  The service was rushed and she was outright rude to us when it came time to deliver the bill.  They refused to do any splits on the bill, even though we had asked before being seated.  The manager did not even care when my uncle mentioned my upcoming wedding party in the facility.  Fast forward two months to November and I am counting down the days to my Vegas wedding.  I get a call from the Triple George Grill telling me that there is a problem.  The event coordinator who had been handling my wedding was no longer with the restaurant.  The person looking at the paper work said the quote was wrong and that I did not have a signed contract (although I have the email proving otherwise).  She said the menu I had selected was $30 more a head than the quoted price.  When I challenged her on this, she said she would talk to her boss and call me back.  A week later she still had not called.  My fiance called to cancel the reservation, and the restaurant offered the originally quoted price; however, it was too little too late.  I have moved my wedding dinner to Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget.  So, if you don't have a problem with bad service and business practices, I highly recommend the chicken parmigiana.",

I had fresh oysters on the half shell (two orders, one of the orders was free using a foursquare checking).  My friends had a NY strip cooked med rare to perfection while the other ordered their veggie entree which had a melange of vegetables braised with balsamic vinegar. Both enjoyed their entrees.  I chased my oysters with a bowl of their French onion soup.  Sweet onions made in a not too thick broth covered sourdough bread.  The soup was finished with a lightly browned and melted piece of Gruyere cheese.  This was more than enough food for me.  If you're in the downtown area, give triple george a try.

We actually sat around and chit chatted with her.  Dinners ...... The two $$ for pricing is for sure not two $$  Maybe the lunch menu is but dinner is about $40 - $60 a plate  The atmosphere is great with a nice vintage feel which I loved. I could imagine Frank Sinatra coming here to eat dinner.  This business has been in this building for 9 years but the building has been around since 1950s. The burger was good, the fish and chips were good.  The chicken with prosciutto wasn't good at all.  Seriously sad about it too. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes and had a weird taste and texture.  My salad was sooooo limp and sad.  I would say skip dinner here and maybe come for lunch.  But I'm so so so so glad we didn't do steak here because this was not a A+ steak house like Ruth Chris or anything like that at all.",

Upon walking into the restaurant, I was extremely worried about where we were dining. It was a very old-school type of restaurant which didn't bother me, but the level of smoke in the air and dingy looks of the place was very offputting. We had to walk through the large bar area to get to the dining area. Our server Madelyn was extremely friendly and attentive. The menus were very old-school as well and felt a little sticky.  Two of the men at our table ordered steaks and they were satisfied. One was very impressed that the waitress and chef knew to cook the steak Pittsburgh style. Another man at the table had the risotto and liked his dish as well. I had the burrata salad with watermelon, which was disappointing as the fruit was not sweet. I ordered the salmon with grilled vegetables for dinner. This was cooked perfectly, the fish was moist and flaky. If you can get past the dingy, dank interior and smoke-filled air and sticky menus, the food doesn't disappoint.  I definitely would not go back here because of the things I mentioned...I just couldn't get passed those things...but if you like a good steak at a reasonable price, you can definitely find it here.",

Kepted our water topped and asked if we needed anything multiple times. Split the ribbed eye with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Ribeye was a little peppery as we can remember but it was still so good. We were offered to replace it with something else but that's why we make an attempt to stop every year we make the trip from LA. Maybe next time we'll be more adventurous.",

Ordered the New York steak it was delicious my wife had   The scallops and risotto and it was very good we also had the clam chowder which was very rich and tasty  The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food we had we were stuffed just need a little more consistency with the servers and if you have specials let the customer know about it",

The prices were also changed which is fine as long it's as satisfying. We have been back twice and food quality differently changed. We spoke to the Chef and he listened what we had to say. Greatly appreciated. Gave us 25% off my BF steak that had a lot of fat. The cream corn was served in a larger plate but watery. Tried the pork belly appetizer. All fat and didn't taste very good. If you are tourist you wouldn't know the difference but locals do.I will be back one more time....we'll see.",

It was supposed to be a surprise. However, even though he left his cell # on the reservation, the hostes called me, not once, but 2 days in a row to confirm the reservation and # of people. Absolutely ruined the surprise .",

    "text": "Came here with my family for a birthday dinner. We were less than pleased with our service here. First off, we were a large party which we understand is a lot of work so we were patient when walking in. We got seated and they didn't have enough chairs for everyone so we had to squish, mind you we DID have reservations. When we got seated it took our waitress a while to get started and to get our drink order. They had us seated at 2 different tables. I think with a party this big you need 2 servers. After our drinks came it took even longer to get our food in. Our reservations were at 8 we ate at 9:40?? Someone in our party ordered a pot roast and the server suggested he get the carrots just to find out the pot roast already had shaved carrots on top, that wasn't cool because we had to pay extra for them. The burger was okay and not hot and the fries were soggy and soft. I felt anytime we said anything any of the waiters delivering food were annoyed, the black guy with the dreads even rolled his eyes when someone said something. The drinks were good and I feel we could've had better service if our waitress had more help. Probably wouldn't recommend this place for big parties but maybe if you have smaller parties this place is better.",

We had a party of 8 so of course I figured the food would take a little while longer to get out to us, no big deal.  The bread came out first and it was a loaf, really good bread and the butter had some sort of sauce that made it really good! Next my friends ordered a clam chowder. They forgot about them and the waiter comes back and asks if they still want it because the meals close to coming out. It was supposed to be an appetizer so that kind of stunk. Finally food came out we had steaks ranging from the George burger, filet mignon, ribeye, pot roast. Let's start with the steaks, some of the comments were way to salty, we had one that was a tad bit over cooked. One of our filets were supposed to be 9 oz but it looked like they brought him out a 6 by mistake. the sides were really sad, one carrot, one broccoli, and a spoonful of mashed potatoes. Overall the steaks ranged from 30-70 with specials being $150 for a surf and turf. Weren't too impressed unfortunately.",

Good flavor when dipping the bread in the oil with the whipped butter. We order waters and looked over the menu.   She ordered the pot roast entree and I had the chicken parmigiana with linguine. The pot roast came out and was very tender, served with seasonal veggies including squash, carrots and zucchini, and mashed potatoes and gravy 3/5. The chicken parmigiana came accompanied by linguine marinara and the same seasonal veggies. The chicken was a little crispy on the edges but inside was delicious 4/5.   Overall the service was great 5/5. This was our second time here and would come back and stick with the lunch specials or sandwiches. The salads are also very good.",

The Caprese Salad was an interesting version of the Classic with Seasonal Tomatoes, Arugula, Mozzarella, Basil and a Balsamic Reduction.The Arugula added texture and a peppery bite.  The Sazerac was the only stumble of the day. It tasted too strongly of Absinthe. Like the bartender added a shot to the glass, instead of just rinsing it with the liquor. If the worst thing that happens during a meal is that my Cocktail is too strong... I can live with that!!! ;)   Service was knowledgeable and friendly and they are wheelchair accessible.

    "text": "Great, mid-level steakhouse. Truly scrumptious and consistent food. Sedate and business-like atmosphere at lunch, but turns into a more romantic and old world ambience at dinner. Try the steamed mussels, which are prepared in a most surprising and delectable sauce, which makes you feel that you are sitting by a hearth after a long day on the water in a French fishing village. The mashed potatoes are fulfilling, and the steak is tasty and well-prepared. It's a great meal, and a good pairing with a trip to the Mob Museum across the street. The omission of one star is for service, which is quite good, but not excellent. It feels like it's the kind of place where \"everybody knows your name,\" but the wait staff and other Front of House are a bit standoffish and not warm, and not super professional. It is the ONLY aspect of the place that reveals it is a franchise chain. If they tweak that, it will BE PERFECT.",

We came during happy hour and it was pretty busy so we found seats at the bar. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful. It's crisp clean linens on the tables and romantic lighting. We began by ordering off of the happy hour menu which by the way the choices were all to die for. I started with the baked goat cheese,bruschetta and the chicken parm sliders. The cheese was a 10. The bruschetta was good but not mind blowing and the chicken park sliders (gtfo) so good! I really liked the ambience in here I felt like a regular the service was phenomenal the two bartenders were nice and suggested many things even though they were busy! I drank the revolution and it was tasty and pretty. Overall this is definitely worth trying when there isn't happy hour. I can't wait to come back!",

Their bartender made great cocktails but they also have wine and beer. We had a Manhattan and the El Diablo. We munched on their warm sourdough bread with butter while waiting for our food. We split the the george chopped salad because it was large enough for an entree or to split as an appetizer.  My husband had to sage buttermilk fried chicken with bacon gravy. He loved it and I did too (I kept stealing bites)! The chicken was so flavorful and moist and the bacon gravy was decadent!   I wanted something a bit lighter and ordered the Mahi Mahi special with pineapple salsa. It was light and the pineapple salsa was a great complement to the Mahi Mahi.  We wanted dessert but were so pleasantly full. Give this place a shot when in Vegas. Service was excellent and this was, hands down one of the best places we dined at for the value and quality.",

The drinks were great! The ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. They had a good variety on the menu with different price options which was a plus. All 16 of us got a free glass of champagne to toast with since we were there for a bachelorette party. The only 2 reasons for not doing 5 stars is some people in the group weren't a huge fan of what they got to eat & when we arrived at the restaurant they didn't have our reservation down. That had me really worried since we had a group of 16. Luckily they weren't that busy and were still able to seat us right away. I talked to the girl on the phone when I made the reservation and even reconfirmed the date/time/for how many before hanging up since it was a big deal to me & I wanted to make sure she had us down. Just happy they still got us in & weren't super busy.",

Plenty of seats in this front area. It's very clean and the hostess was friendly.  We were dining there for lunch and she gave us a table in the back.  The back dining area seems like a completely different place.  It has a darker and more intimate feel.  There are tv screens in the wall for some entertainment.     Justin was our waiter and was a delight.  We had great service throughout our meal which made me very happy.   I decided on George's Club with fries.   This sandwich is huge and could only finish half.   It was actually piled too high for me to get my mouth around it.  Fries were crispy and delicious.    I would have no problems coming back here when in the downtown area.   Thanks for a great lunch!",

It what put it over the top is their butter with herbs and balsamic vinaigrette put it over the top. We asked for more.. With two friends and we ordered two bone in filets and a 9 ounce filet. My filet came out perfectly cooked, my friends were well done and were supposed to be medium. Server immediately took them all and had all three remade. They wanted to make sure my food came out at the same time so we ate together. The manager, Melody was professional, sweet and came out apologized and brought out another appetizer while we waited. Food was fantastic. After dinner they brought out a free dessert, the chocolate lava cake which was very good (the vanilla ice cream that came with it was even better). We all know that sometimes things don't go right, but it's what you do with it, and the staff saved our experience. I will absolutely go back and would recommend anyone else to.",

Unfortunately, I don't have any of these habits.  The menu is quite diverse. I have tried almost all of it, from steak to pasta. IMHO the \"best under ten\" lunch specials have the best bang for the buck. There is not a single person that hasn't enjoyed the Pot Roast, which is soul food at it's finest. Downtown Ruben is also very very good (I'd recommend  with side of coleslaw).    Soups including chowders are all home made. Most of the time soup of the day is quite tasty.   There is exclusive parking in 3rd St for customers. Waitress are responsive and friendly, however, when packed, kitchen struggles from time to time, not in quality but in speed..

The first thing I noticed was how friendly and patient the hostess was because I could not remember whose name the reservation was under. As I was being seated, I noticed the bar area had ample space and the bartenders had excellent drink presentation. The overall space is a lot larger inside than it looks outside.   The most amazing thing about this restaurant is the vegan menu with ample selections. I had the Vegan \"chicken\" Marsala and the house salad. Prior to the salad arriving, Mary, our server brought out bread with butter and olive oil. My friends raved on how crispy the outside was, yet the inside was soft and delectable.   The mixed greens in my salad were fresh and crisp and I would recommend the balsamic vinaigrette.When my plate arrived, I was very pleased with the green beans and carrots. They had the right amount of crunch and tasted great with the marsala sauce and mushrooms that were atop my \"chicken\". Out of the vegetarian/vegan plates I have ordered over the years from various restaurants, this one looked the most appetizing. My friends who never want anything vegetarian, wanted to try the \"chicken\" marsala with the basmati rice and they loved it!  Needless to say, I cleaned my plate and enjoyed every bite!   Since it was my friend's birthday, Mary brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream and whipped topping. The cake looked amazing and my friends enjoyed it.   My bill was about $25, and although it was a little more expensive than what I would normally spend, it was well worth it and I will definitely be back!",

It was a cajun pasta with shrimp and chicken.  Service was great, my waiter Jason was pleasant and informative. I tend to dine out a lot and make it a point to frequent places that have great service, wonderful food and a pleasant vibe. Needless to say I will be back.",

I can't remember the name of our server (younger gentleman) but he was great. Atmosphere, location, and vibe resonates that of old Las Vegas, and peeps, let me tell you, this steakhouse is a secret that most don't know about, even locals. Go there. Now. Stop reading and go!

It was too tight and awkward.  We asked for a manager.  Within a minute he was at our table.  We complained about the size of the group and the table we were sitting at.  He listened and offered to make sure we were at a table that we desired.  It was not another three minutes that he personally led us to a new table.  He was apologetic and really made sure we felt comfortable the rest of the night. Our food was good and we were out quickly ready to see a show.  We were very pleased how they quickly managed the issues and made sure the guests were happy.",

Our last visit over new year's had much to be desired.  It seems they've made many changes. And even though we had reservations, (but were a little early), they placed us in an \"over flow\" dining area which I didn't  care for.  You loose the privacy of the wooden booths, especially when you have a group of noisy patrons (I should say Pickled Patrons) a couple of tables away. Gone are the little relish plates and ambiance that we used to love.  I ordered one of the chefs specials (crab stuffed lobster)  There might have been 4 bites total to the lobster and it was a bit mushy.  Smallest one I've ever seen.  and the \"Crab Stuffed\" consisted of what seemed to be 2 small mushy crab cakes (light on the crab), that just sat on top.  The rice was tastey, but the mixed vegetables were not.  Very mushy.  And no soup or salad, that is all extra now.  I don't mind paying the prices, but not when this is now what you get.  This was always one of our usual stops, as well as referring all of our friends, but next time we are in town, I don't think it will be.",

    "text": "I am so disappointed with my experience this past Saturday night. I made a reservation for a girl's night with my sister and some friends. I had heard amazing things about the food so we thought we'd get dressed up and give it a try.  We called on our way to let the staff know we were running a few minutes behind, and were about 5 people less than we anticipated. They were fabulous and made sure we didn't lose our spot in the process. Kudos to the ladies up front. They were great.  When we were seated we immediately got to looking over our menu. I have a dairy allergy so I had planned ahead and read the menu online. On the website they offer a vegan menu, so I happily chose the ravioli in advance, as a dish I don't normally get to eat. When our waiter (Cameron) arrived we were all prepared with our choices, and even ordered an appetizer. I ordered the ravioli, even though the vegan menu wasn't presented to us. Someone ordered a steak, and one of our friends ordered the chicken alfredo, with an addition of shrimp as well.  As the waiter took each of our orders, he asked if we wanted a house or ceasar salad. We were excited for our food.   About 10 minutes later I received my salad, bread and then a (very unprofessional) tap on the shoulder.  The waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not available. But they had a meatless chicken marsala, a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger. I let him know that I am allergic to dairy, but I do eat meat, so I'd rather see the regular menu, if possible. He kind of just stared at me like I had a few extra heads, and then moved to grab me the menu. When he returned, he hovered while I made my selection. I explained I would like the lemon herb chicken, but I would need it made with oil, and not butter, if that's how it's made. Again the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, so I added, \"Please tell the kitchen staff I have a dairy allergy, no worries\". And again he stared. And he said \"Well you can't have mashed potatoes, no can you.\" (You see the menu doesn't tell you what the sides are, only that they are pared by a chef). So I told him no, to which he replied \"So veggies and pilaf then??\". And I said that was fine.  Then we waited. More than 45 minutes came and went. No appetizer, no water refills, no checking on us, nothing. Our food arrived and our friend's dish did not have both chicken and shrimp. It had just shrimp. So we explained to the expeditor the issues, and that we never received out appetizer. We explained that we weren't mad, just wanted to make sure that these items were not on our final bill. The expeditor said he'd let our waiter know. A few moments later the waiter showed up with a manager and they apologized for the mix ups, though the waiter did not seem very sincere.   We finished our meals and our plates were cleared pretty quickly. The waiter came back and seemed much more sincere. He admitted that he had just plain forgot to input our appetizer. He handed us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the house. We excitedly started looking over the menu... ... .. 15 minutes later, we had to flag over the waiter for our check. We let him know, while the offer was nice, we now had to go, so we did not want our free dessert. He insisted that we take it to go. We explained that we could not trust that we would get it quickly, and thus, only wanted our check.   A few minutes later the check was dropped on our table. And to my absolutely disappointment, I found our salads for a fee on our check. The waiter never explained that we were paying for salads. We each ordered our entrees and then the waiter asked \"House salad or ceasar?\" We were led to believe that was part of our meal. So we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation and he stated \"The salads have a price on the menu\", in a condescending tone. Salads have a price everywhere. That way if that's all you want to eat, you can order that. Such crap. So he stated if we wanted, he'd take the salads off, and walked away. And then, from behind our booth, he handed our check back and said \"HERE\". And upon inspection, our of the salads remained. We paid it. But only because we'd had enough.  We didn't tip. We don't even feel bad about it.",

I ordered pot roast and my husband ordered the whole roasted chicken, both were delicious!  We ARE coming back for sure.  We only chose this place as it was on our validation list for where we parked downtown otherwise we would've missed this absolute wonderful restaurant- I've been to Vegas a dozen times or more, and this is by far the best food and service I've ever found and to boot you don't have to pay an arm and a leg!

    "text": "We came here on a recommendation from a friend, and WOW!!! My first thought was way too many waitstaff/ bartenders/ hosts, but then I got it, I really got it! Someone was always there to say hi, get a drink, fill water, clear a plate, take an order. And not in an obnoxious get out of here way but in a we want you to have everything you need to enjoy yourself. Each person we dealt with had a sense of humor, was courteous and was very knowledgeable on their food & wine. Being the foodies we are, we kept sitting by the kitchen to really watch the entire scene. Let me tell you something, these owners and management have truly invested in all of their staff. The executive chef was expediting from the back of the house to an expediter on the front of the house. It was truly amazing to watch such professionalism through out the experience. Being in the Bay area, this restaurant could easily take on the upper echelon here.  We loved it so much, we were there three nights in a row! Cannot wait to go back!  The night I want to review is our first night there. The three of us each ordered a martini style cocktail - lemon drop, cosmo, vodka martini. Each was made so well, the glass was cold and ice chips were at the top.   We started with baked goat cheese marinara and oysters on the half shell. The baked goat cheese was excellent. The sauce was not at all overbearing- slight kick, good flavor of garlic and tomato, olive oil, the accompanying bread was fresh and warm. The goat cheese had a nice mild flavor to it, finishing off the dish very well. The oysters - wow - so fresh! I like smaller ones. These were closer to medium but very, very fresh and flavorful! They came with a house made vinaigrette which really accented the flavor.  For our entrees, I went to the dark side. I say that because I stay away from typical gamey meats in any restaurant. Well I chose this coq au vin creation with duck, lamb and beef (we were there a few months ago, so the memory is not quite there). This dish was absolutely amazing! All the meats were so tender, falling of the bones and melting in your mouth. The sauce was not at all too rich or heavy, coating the meat & veggies. The veggies were roasted to perfection.  One friend had the petrale sole. OK, this was huge! It was lightly battered, pan fried and all kinds of delicious! It was covered with a lemon butter sauce, not creamy at all just perfect.   Another friend had porcini crusted rib eye. This was a huge cut of meat, grilled to perfection at medium rare. The steak was so tender, it too melted in your mouth. The porcini crust was an excellent compliment to the flavor of the rib eye.   Triple George had an extensive wine list which was paired excellently to each of our dishes by the staff.  Everyone was beyond professional, completely exceeding any of our expectations!",

    "text": "After getting our fill of crime and punishment at the Mob Museum, we discovered the Triple George Grill on our walk to Fremont Street, and stopped in. The place impressed. The bar in the main room looked like it had stools for 60, stretching nearly the length of the room. On one side were old fashioned booths, partially enclosed within wood paneled walls and somewhat private,  The open kitchen was at the far end of the room. There were two adjacent rooms as well, we checked out both of them, requesting booth seating. We were offered water choices immediately, along with menus. Our drink order was taken by a waiter who turned out to have been born in the same city in the Mid West as both my wife and myself. We ordered the oysters as an appetizer, which were served on a bed if ice, with both cocktail sauce and mignonette and some very hot horseradish which really had a solid kick. The lemon was in a yellow wrap with a green tie, a major sign to me that we were dealing with a chef who did not slavishly follow modern trends for the sake of blind obedience. Fresh, clean, and a bit of a cucumber like in flavor, these Vancover oysters stood out. This was like sitting seaside in Seattle where oysters are a big thing. Our actual server was Becky, who helped direct us to our main selections. The problem was, for me at least, that I could have ordered almost everything on the list. I am part traditionalist and part experimentalist. So things like onion soup, pot roast, fried chicken, Dover sole and the like have a deep appeal. Being a vegetarian my wife asked if there were any things for her. Promptly the special menu for vegetarians was produced. So we both had serious choices. Nice. I would not feel so bad indulging in old favorites while my wife dined on lettuce and pasta p.v. I ordered the pot roast and loved it. What stood out was how the dish came together with Al Dante green beans and baby carrots, smooth and seasoned mashers, and savory, tender and ample beef over a dark, pure gravy. We also shared a wedge, split by staff. Crisp and dressed with blue cheese. Sometimes I can resist dessert, but not here. The bread pudding turned out to be a round shaped pudding over a jd carmel sauce with whipped cream and very fresh blackberries. It was enough for two. Btw, the vegetarian sandwich was also delightful, and mostly saved for a late night snack. I must mention the Sierra Nevada ale was on tap and superb. Weighing everything, this was a great experience, and a lot less expensive than hotel dining. For example, our bread pudding dessert, ample for two, was $4.95, which makes it the bargain of the century in Vegas 2014. I will be back. The service was second to none. So was the food.",

    "text": "First! The bread here is AWESOME! ... Made a reservation for Valentines Dinner and as soon as we showed up were seated. They had a Valentine's prefixed menu but we're also serving the regular menu as well so that was good. We orders the crab cakes and the shrimp cocktail. The cocktail was pretty basic with nothing special about it. The crab cakes were really good but if you order them make sure the order extra sauce with them cause it doesn't come with enough on the plate. For entrees we had the signature Shrimp George and I had the recommended Pot Roast. The shrimp entree was amazing with a lot of flavor. The pot roast was also really good but heavy and rich as pot roast is. After the apps, bread and heave meal there was no room for desert. It's located in a very odd place in downtown Las Vegas next to a pizza place and a biker bar so if you find your self trying to find it and are surrounded by drunks getting pizza and bikers you are probably in the right place. You can valet at the grand hotel and the restaurant will validate your valet ticket. I would of given this place a 5 star except there were 2 big parties (one on each end of the room) that were so loud and obnoxious they were were ruining our experience. Hope this helps . Enjoy!",

Feels like they are going for a business crowd so that's probably the best target consumer if you are downtown or need a power lunch spot.  The food itself is all well-made, just doesn't knock your socks off.   I've been trying to find places to eat downtown more often - this is just an OK option",

Second time, took my wife who enjoyed it as well. Everything is well prepared, flavorful and creative.  This is a gem, just north of Fremont Street.  Pricing is reasonable and the portions are big enough to fill most eaters without forcing leftovers.  Their potpie is huge and tasty. The atmosphere is definitely old school Vegas!  This place is definitely on my regular list.  Also, they give YELP discounts! Hooray!",

I would go back there just for that (although it was the \"soup of the day\" so don't think it's offered everyday. :(  The pot roast however is a staple on the menu and that was cooked perfectly.  My companion had a spicy pasta dish which had a nice kick to it.  Only food item that I wasn't that impressed with was their tomato salad which was basically just 4 slices of tomato with a little garnish...yawn (and certainly not worth $8 for that lame of a presentation). My date had the caprese which was much better choice at $9.    Waiter was very pleasant & helpful with suggestions (though he should have suggested the caprese when I ordered the tomato salad in my opinion).  He did disappear for a while towards the end of the meal, I finally had to track him down so we could get our bill, I found him next door in the Mob bar hanging out.  I guess I should look at the positives that at least he wasn't beating someone up or running an illegal dice game in the mob bar haha.",

The idea of a hip, New York-style, off-strip steakhouse in downtown Las Vegas is very appealing, but sadly 3xGeorge falls short.  Service was good. The steaks were good (although one of them was overcooked and sent back)...but I don't want \"good\", I want \"great\", dammit!  The biggest problem is that \"Hogs and Heifers\" is right next door, and there are a bunch of fat, tattooed yahoos revving their bikes loudly throughout the night with no consideration for, or awareness of, anyone else in the vicinity. Not that I blame 3xGeorge for that, but it doesn't help the overall dining experience.",

Our group had oysters on the half shell (boring), crispy chicken salad (large and nicely done), reuben sandwiches (OK) and baked cod that was actually breaded, fried and tasteless with mashed potates (cold) and a broccoli/zucchini medley that was ok.  Bloody Mary cocktail was spicy -- too much so to be enjoyed.  High-moderate prices for just ok food.  We'll try them for cocktails only next trip.",

Granted, we were not dressed to the nines but we were dressed ok for the neighborhood, a biker bar and pawn shop on the block. When we walked in, we got the up down disapproving look from the gentleman at the door. We were directed to the bar. When we sat down, we were semi greeted by a surly old bartender, far past his prime. When I inquired as to what he would recommend , he stated a shot of whiskey or a bud light. That offended me to the core as I took that to mean I was not sophisticated enough for a martini, wine or a specialty mixed drink. I then inquired about a sparkling wine, his response oh YOU want a wine list? I replied yes I would. I happen to have a sophisticated wine palate.  I was tempted to order a bottle of Dom, but could not get his attention to get served, not to mention all of the nasty fruit flies infesting the garnishes at the cocktail station. Needless to say, Me and my black American Express card will take our business to an establishment that would like to serve me in a clean environment with a smile.  I eat out often and will be passing this info to my business network as well as friends. And we are locals!",

The tuna was served rare so it was sent back to the kitchen until it was suitably medium rare.  I could tell something was amiss when a frown appeared on her forehead after taking a few bites.  The tuna was extremely tough and the potatoes had been genetically re-mastered resulting in an out-of-worldly consistency and flavor. I fared only slightly better with the seafood cioppino - shrimp, mussels, crab, white fish, clams and scallops in a somewhat spicy tomato sauce.

Our lunch took over 40 min to deliver minus one of my lunch guests soups which we had to ask for three times. My butterfish was coated in aioli and I sent it back to discover there was no more fish.  Okay. So I asked for mine back and the server said they threw it away.  The manager came over and asked what I wanted and I said the mahi mahi I guess with macaroni and cheese as a side. The mahi came quick and was awful and mushy and gray in color.  The manager forgot my macaroni and cheese after a 5 minute debate on why on earth I would pair macaroni with fish.  Not remembering an order seems to be the theme here. Then we were fully billed for the fish that I barely ate.  The ambiance is cool but the food and service are better just about anywhere. A $26 entree that wasn't what I ordered and 55 min after I sat down.  Get it together on the service.  Ridiculous.

    "text": "For a weeknight, the restaurant was fairly busy, but we were seated quickly. The atmosphere is great, and the drinks were good. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, calamari, and french fries. The calamari was chewy and overcooked, the sauces were just standard marinara and didn't taste homemade, and the goat cheese was average. The highlight was the french fries. For the main course we ordered a chicken dish, a small fillet, and the ahi tuna. For a high-end restaurant there were several problems that we encountered with our meal.  The sides on our dishes all came cold or lukewarm at best. The ahi tuna was low-grade meat, and very tough.  The fillet was good, and the chicken dish was tasty. When we told the waiter about the tuna, he just apologized but did nothing else.  We did not order dessert and left.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, but it didn't make up for the less-than-great food.",

Gave Steven 3 dishes to choose from and he surprised me with the Shrimp George...ridiculous! Like Crab cakes and shrimp all in one, with perfect rice and veggies, too.  My husband had the creme brulee and it was perfection.  Had another martini to take outside, and Ed added blue cheese olives and wow!!!! A completely fantastic experience. We'll be back, and soon.",

    "text": "Ok really what happened to the food?   I loved the clubby feel of the restaurant. It was very much a place that reminded me of back east with its dim lit recesses.   However, seriously WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOOD?  We got oysters that were actually very tasty. I would order those again. It was a good start. I was excited.  I ordered a steak sandwich which came and had a thin grisly piece of meat, probably the cheapest cut from Sysco. Why I was asked how I wanted my meat cooked is beyond me because this cheap piece of meat was incapable of being cooked any other way than done. It was encased by a plain dry white hoggie roll, topped with one slice of seemly unwashed lettuce and one slice of tomato and red onion and chipotle mayo on the side.  However the saddest part of that plate was the INSTANT mashed potatoes. They just broke my heart sitting there sad, flavorless and gelatinous on my plate.  Why would you do that to your patrons? Why?   The other half got a burger which was adequate. The meat was thick, the onions flavorful, bacon thick and crispy. The vegetables were a shining star lots of flavor, good variety and cooked al dente.   However the plate ran into trouble because the flavorful juicy vegetables were right next to the burger on the plate which by the time it was served made the burger bun soggy. It would be an easy fix to put the veg. in a ramekin. The fries were ok.   Overall, drinks and bar, service and Atmosphere A++++, 5 stars, but the foods was really disappointing.",

My hub had a burger and fries and couldn't finish his dish because it was a bit overwhelming. One of our friends had a steak and mash and he was definitely not impressed.  So basically our food venture turned out to be an experience we won't be trying again. It wasn't really that special and it was a little high priced. The service was also average. Our waiter kept disappearing for long periods of time and was hard to get the things that we needed when we really needed them, such as utensils.  Overall I'd encourage you foodies out there to give this place a shot and hopefully you'll come out with something better than I did.",

The prices were a little closer to the Strip costs, so it loses a star for that, but the meal was excellent!   I ordered the Ribeye, my girlfriend got the crab-stuffed shrimp and we split the goat cheese marinara and a caprese salad. The Ribeye was terrific, its the first correctly cooked meat I've had in Vegas in months. The crab-stuffed shrimp were very flavorful and tasty. I enjoyed the salad more than the goat cheese, but it was still good.  I would suggest ordering drinks from next door, just ask to see the cocktail menu from Mob Bar. It takes a little extra time, but they're worth it. The bourbon basket and real McCoy were my favorites, while my girlfriend didn't like her ginger drink that much.  The construction outside is a bit of a decor deterrent, but once that is completed, I will definitely be coming back.",

This place makes you feel like you have stepped back in time to another era - The Golden Age of Vegas where women were classy and provocative but not trashy; men smoked cigars and Frank Sinatra was always crooning in the background. It just has that classic; old school feel about it -not unlike the Tadich Grill in San Francisco -and the decor is in keeping with this i.e obligatory piano; large, wooden booths line the walls and the wait staff are dressed appropriately. The menu as you would expect at a grill is largely meat and fish based and very classic. Everything we ordered was exceptionally good from the sublime Lobster Bisque to the outstanding Wedge Salad. Heck even the mashed potatoes were amazing.   I really love this place and cant wait to come back.",

Since we've been on diets, we decided to make an early reservation around 5:30 pm. We were politely greeted and taken to our table without a wait. What a nice looking and well setup establishment. The bar was located in the center of the room upon entering. We were seated in a nicely built and well though of cubicle towards the back the restaurant. It was like we had the place to ourselves with the privacy. Our waitress was a very tall young lady, she was the best. She was polite, helpful, informative, efficient and on and on. I can't say enough about her customer skills, (I'm sorry that I forgot her name). My girlfriend chose 9 oz. Filet Mignon with a medley of carrots and broccolini at 35.00. The chef cooked it to perfection of medium and it melted in our mouths. We tend to share our selections, as she always claims to make the best selection of meat. I had the special of the day 12 oz. Steak with a lobster tail and vegetables. I think that mine was the to die for selection of the day, be agreed to disagree. My drink selection was a Tequila Maria. This was the only flaw of the dinner as it was to spicy for my taste. We ate on a Tuesday evening, and it was just a perfect dinner for two. I will for sure visit Triple George Grill again.",

The food is great; as in you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. From fried chicken to a porcini crusted steak, it's just that good.   On our last two visits, though, we found another reason to come down. Our waiter, Andrew, was just the best. I seriously wanted him to sit at the table with us. I felt like we were in his home and he was just the most gracious host. He was professional as a job requires but warm and playful at the same time.   When, not if, you come to Triple George make sure to ask for Andrew and eat a yummy meal!",

    "text": "Our last night in Vegas and we were planning on visiting Fremont Street, but wanting a nice and leisurely steak dinner beforehand. Happened upon Triple George Grill on Yelp, so thought we'd give it a try. We always prefer local to chains, like Morton's or Lawry's. We were promptly seated in a cozy private booth, which is what we prefer. Monica, our server, got our drink order and we let her know we weren't in a hurry, but enjoying our last night of vacation.  Shortly after, a party of 8 was seated directly across from us. Normally I have no trouble with this, but they were overtly loud and one person in particular was very obnoxious. It got so bad that my husband and I couldn't even hear each other talking. I let our server know and asked to be moved to another booth. None available. The only thing I could think to do was play The Beatles station on my Pandora to try to muffle the constant deluge.  By the time our appetizer came, I had the volume up to full (I've NEVER turned music on in a restaurant, let alone needed it to muffle fellow patrons anywhere!) and still overbearing.  By the time our meal came, the enjoyment of the meal was over and we sat there staring at each other because any attempt at conversation was a mute point.  We nicely asked our server several times during our visit if something could be done and she stated it was their 25th wedding anniversary (and??? You can be rude if you've been married that long????). We were seated first for privacy, the restaurant was less than half full the entire time with a large back conference area almost completely open, so they could've been asked to move to that  area since they were highly disruptive. Nothing was ever done. I felt bad for our sever, but apologies don't do much when she had the power to resolve the situation. We paid over $200 for a miserable time and would've enjoyed Mc Donald's better, at that point.  At the very end, the owner came over to ask how our food was. I assumed he understood we were not happy with our dining environment. He was totally clueless. Sad to say, this would've never happened in a fine dining establishment. I doubt it would've even happened at IHOP.",

    "text": "My wife and I were scheduled to meet some friends around 8 on Fremont Street so we we made a dinner reservation at Triple George Grill for 6:45 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated immediately. My wife wanted to sit outside on the patio because it was a beautiful night in the mid 60s. Be aware, that if you sit outside, there is a lot of foot traffic from people walking between The Grand and Fremont Street. Also, Hogs and Heifers is right next door so you're going to hear a lot of hoo-ha from the bar and choppers coming and going. None of that bothered us at all.  Service was very good for the most part from Brian. He was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all questions. Time length between visits increased as he got busier. Our dinner took just under two hours.  Appetizers were a half dozen oysters and the goat cheese marinara. Entrees were the surf and turf special for that night and the fish and chips. And for dessert, the chocolate indulgence.  The warm sourdough bread with butter was delicious. The oysters were served with a nice mignonette which made them enjoyable. The goat cheese marinara was probably our favorite. Creamy, tart goat cheese went well with the marinara and bread. My wife was satisfied but not impressed with her entree. The dessert is recommended for the chocolate lover (they serve it with chocolate ice cream, which is different than some of the older pictures posted).  My entree was not executed as I hoped. I ordered the center cut ribeye with the stuffed lobster ($55). The steak was ordered medium rare and it came out pretty close to medium well, thus a tougher and drier cut of meat. The lobster tail was overcooked leaving not much in the tail but some more tough, dried out meat (see picture).  We'll most likely be back to try other menu items. 15% off entree with Yelp check in.",

Not to mention it was $80 bucks with our meals and 1 soda and a water  The ambiance is nice but that's about it   Moral of the story NOT WORTH IT save your money and go to Pizza Rock next door....",

Lots of locals likes this steakhouse apparently and I can see why. It's a block away from Fremont street experience so it's convenient to get to also. It was a beautiful night so we opted to sit in the front patio. Gorgeous and you can subtly hear the music from the Fremont Street shenanigans.   We ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and the pot roast. It was phenomenal. The steak was tender and cooked to medium rare perfection. Flavorful and amazing with the potatoes. We found the mashed a tad bit on the salty side but it wasn't a deal breaker. But the pot roast oooooh! You won't be disappointed. Generous portion and it was very tender but not overcooked. It wasn't soggy and didn't look like carnitas on your plate. Definitely a must have and if I could, wish to be having some right now.   Cocktails were good. Beware of ordering the old fashioned... We found there was nothing \"old fashioned\" about it. Aside from that, we will return next time we are in Vegas. It's a nice switch from other steakhouses and it was priced between 24-35 per dish. Not bad.",

Sandwich, sauteed veggies, salad, and 2 dessert cheesecake bites. Talk about a nice lunch it was great.  The booth we sat in reminded me of the old movies where it was dark wood and sort of enclosed. Loved it. Try Triple George and be triple happy. Thank you for a great visit. Harriet",

The hostess said it's been here around 13 years but it really had an old time classic feel. It has a large wooden bar and the booths are tucked away, kind of cool. I don't feel like I can give a fair rating because we came for a light lunch. Also as a vegetarian I cannot rate a steak  our neighbors had a steak and it sure looked large and juicy.  Our waitress very friendly and provided good servixeZ My salad was fresh and my veggie sandwich (which was surprisingly a wrap) was good. My friend had soup and salad and said they were both good.   Next time I will try the pasta",

They asked how I wanted it cooked, I said medium. It came out beyond well done. Dry and salty. Many restaurants don't even give you the option of how you want your burger cooked. They should go that route. Nothing worse than them asking you and not even getting close to what you ordered. Like, why even ask?  My friend ordered chicken parmigiana with the marinara on the side (weird, I know), and it came out with the sauce all over it.  Another friend got the filet mignon.  She said an applebees steak is better than what she got.  Stay far, far away!",

And it's seasoned on point! And the red meat as you cut through it. I can dream all night after eating it!   Moving on to lobster Mac and cheese!! They put a bunch of lobster on it!

It wasn't that busy but service was slow and once we got our food, we were ignored the rest of the night. My food was good, but didn't blow me away and for the price wasn't worth it.

    "text": "Spent a wonderful evening dining at Triple George Grill in Downtown Las Vegas.  Like other reviewers we were not sure on what to expect, as the establishment itself is located off of the main downtown area.  Once you enter, you are transported from a dark neighborhood street to an old school fine dining establishment.  The front area is all bar, long, all wood counters, high top chairs, and friendly barkeeps.  The back is the formal dining room.  Again, old school, which was dimly lit, dark wood table and chairs, cloth napkins.  The waitstaff is very efficient, professional, and most importantly personable.  Being first timers, our server took the time to explain the menu, as well as direct us to a \"special limited time\" option, which we did order off of.  We started off our meal with a couple glasses of recommended wine, then shared a chopped salad.  We were going to \"family\" style the salad, but our awesome attendant had the salad split.  The item we ordered off the special menu was a thick wet aged porterhouse steak, truffled mash potatoes, and roasted root vegetables.    That steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, which was requested.  The salt, char, and perfect doneness really put an exclamation point to a fantastic meal.  The truffled mash potatoes were really rich, with just the right touch of truffle oil.  The roasted vegetables were also perfectly roasted with just the right amount of seasoning, and al dente doneness.  Oh!  The wine matched beautifully with the salad, as well as our dinner.  The dinner was filling, and the service and atmosphere added to a great evening.  We will surely return again soon.",

Their would pre-authorized your your total bill plus a 20% surcharge on your card. Your authorized amount will be charged while your pre-authorized amount will remained and  tie up your funds for 4 days. Simply, it means that you will pay double on your meal and half of your bill will be refunded back to you in 4 days.  This process applies to all credit cards except American Express.  The Night Manager, April, does not have a clue regarding this policy and her people skills is extremely poor for such a classy, high-end establishment.

I never realized how enjoyable that could be.   I LOVED the bread! I loved it so much I kept going back to it and taking bites of it throughout the entire meal! Now that's good bread.  I ordered the Pot Roast and found it to be tender, very tasty and well complimented by the mashed potatoes. It came with steamed carrots and broccoli. The only downside to that was, I tend to prefer my carrots cooked with the pot roast, not separately, but in spite of this I very much enjoyed my meal. All around good experience!",

Think it couldn't get better? Well it did. I had a cup of Baked Onion Soup, Oh my goodness was it ever delicious! In between these two rounds of I had 2 margarita's on the rocks. EXCELLENT is all that can describe them. I like my margaritas tart and no where near sweet, so these were perfect for my pallet. Next came the petite Filet butterflied and cooked medium, mashed potatoes and chef's veggies. To be honest, I didn't have much room for the veggies, but the taste of carrot I had was superb. The filet melted in my mouth just like the garlic butter melted on top of the filet. Hubby had the Ribeye and said it was even more tender and juicy than my filet (he tasted it), how that was possible is beyond me. BTW, we are locals and have access to many steak houses in Las Vegas. So far, this was the best steak I have had in Vegas in the 12 years I have lived here. Brian was our server and he was great and attentive to us. Also, if you go during nicer weather, sit out front. It was perfect to people watch and enjoy this fabulous meal!",

I ended up accidentally leaving something behind and Caroline held it safely for my return -I did like the artichoke spinach dip, it was great!!  - Tyler, the man in Valet was very friendly!  Bad: - My waitress was from Chicago and her name was Deena or Diane I think..? She never smiled, was not welcoming, and dry. She Did not offer suggestions, and did not have a good understanding between vegan options and vegetarian options. I do appreciate that they are trying to be accommodating, but the waiters must be knowledgable about the menu. - I ordered hot mint tea twice and was brought everything but each time. However, They had apple cider lol. I just took what I could get -The asparagus  salad on special was clearly old. I hate that I paid for it, tasteless too. -Unfortunately I'm not excited about this place any more :/",

    "text": "One Monday night, we came to Triple George after a nice happy hour on Fremont East.  I was excited to try this spot as it's been getting a bunch a great reviews.  Also, I'm ALWAYS looking for a new place to Yelp :)  This place is pretty spacious!  Dark wood panels with a HUGE bar.  It practically goes the length of the entire place. Then, when you pass the bar, you think it's over and then there's another room in the back with more dining tables.  Great space.    I don't remember our servers name, however, she was a little interesting.  She had a soft voice and a loud voice.  The soft voice came across with a slight English accent and the loud voice was straight American accent.  I thought maybe it was me, but then the entire party of 6 said the same thing!  Maybe it was a trick, however, not really funny.  Just plain weird!  For my meal, I asked another server for any beer specials and he brought me a list of $3 beers!  WOW, I was sooo happy and drank a few Miller Lites that night.  I also had the Calamari appetizer for $8.95.  The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked great.  It wasn't rubbery at all.  My only rant: It needed salt.  No flavor!  The marinara sauce was warm and a great compliment to the breaded flavor.    Ok, now the really bad part.  When the bill came, I found out all my beers weren't $3 at all.  The menu that was passed to me by another server was a beer specials list for Mob Bar next door.  First off, I thought they were connect since there's a door leading to the bar that was open.  And of course, why would a Triple George server give me a Mob Bar menu without telling me.  It didn't make sense.  When I brought it to the attention of our \"British\" server, the American accent came out and corrected me.  Although funny, I wasn't buying her spiel.  Not a good impression.  This bar is close to the action, yet far away, if that makes sense.  I'm not going to line up here again, but I also wouldn't mind revisiting, if given the opportunity.  Maybe my next visit will be better!",

I asked what he would get and he suggested the most expensive thing on the menu, their signature Ribeye. My first thought \"were locals, no need to go that fancy on a Thursday night\" but he sold my Uncle into it and it was truly delicious. Most restaurants talk a good talk when they suggest their (BLANK) is the best but this Ribeye was one of the best I've had. I got the Filet, also very good. Great company, great food, great night.

They serve very large portions at a great price and the service is very efficient yet friendly. It reminds me of alot of restaurants in the Bay Area which to me is a welcome relief from the Strip. Some of my favorites are the Porcini crusted Rib Chop and the Porterhouse. Unlike other steakhouses Triple George adds a vegetable and starch choice to their entree making it a great deal. If you are tired of getting gouged by the restaurants on the strip and the rude service that Las Vegas strip restaurants seem to give do yourself a favor and try triple George.",

But I disagree 100% that Brian is a bad server.  We had him on our first time and have requested him ever since.  Maybe you just had him on an off day.  He is always attentive and our food is right every time.  Recommend - Shrimp Cocktail, Crab Cocktail, Steak, Crab Legs, Chopped Salad, Chocolate Chip Cookie and Apple/Berry Cobbler.  The drinks are strong and nothing is to expensive.  ENJOY!!!!  Now I want to go back tonight!",

Paid street parking was easy, and in we were! Seated immediately, and a beautiful lemon drop martini arriving shortly, we were presented with a special Mama Mia menu which was fun, however when I ordered the greek salad which looked to be a starter on the menu, was told it would be too large for a starter. Made me sad or wondered why the menu was presented in a Starter, Entree, Dessert order, but selected second choice of chopped salad. Very good, but very heavy on the vinegar (and I love vinegar-my husband found his house salad Way Too Vinegar). Perfect blackened salmon with wild rice and veggies, so no quibble here. Vegan Chicken Marsala was served over white rice and very good, my husbands only desire is that there would have been more Marsala sauce and mushrooms, as the quantity of sauce for all the white rice left a lot of plain white rice which would have been better with sauce and mushrooms. Very club, mobster, cigar and martini vibe which was enjoyable, but the noise level got very loud-perhaps off work Zappos folks at 630pm? l will come again and the beautiful tree lights on the street looked magical downtown.",

We requested separate checks (which would have been about 10 checks as we were couples) right away from the waitress and she said \"NO, we can not do that, my math is not good\". Then she proceeded to say \"And I can't take 20 different credit cards, you will need to use the ATM machine by the bathrooms\".  Are you kidding me? We are on vacation not carrying around a bunch of cash, especially to pay for this expensive meal!  We then spoke with the manager Kim who also refused to separate the checks under no circumstances. The waitress \"forgot\" to take the birthday girl's $25 groupon off and had taken $25 extra tip for herself that was meant to pay for some of the birthday girl's dinner. By the end of the meal the birthday girl was distraught and her father had to pay $100 more than he should have. Never again :o(",

The last couple times that we have eaten here, however, the food has been very mediocre and the lunches turned into horrible experiences.   The first incident involved debit cards used to pay the bill.  We were told that the credit card machine was down, so they processed the cards the \"old way\" of using the carbon copy swiper.  A day or so later every person that paid with a card had fraudulent transactions on their account. We decided to go back several months later (with cash) and received two inaccurate orders.  When one order was sent back, he was told it would take about 20 minutes for the correct order to come out.  We had already been there for about 30 minutes, so it was brought up that the person whose order it was would not have time to eat their lunch.  The person asked for a possible discount for the inconvenience, etc.  The manager eventually came over and was beyond rude from the time he walked up to out table. He aggressively argued with the table and eventually stormed away.    One good point about the restaurant is that the owner was present when this occurred  and did not charge our table.",

All the entrees come with the sides and are figured into the price which was a nice change. I had the bone-in ribeye and she had the filet mignon. I don't think they were prime cuts of meat, not like you get at Rainwater's, but they were cooked well and had plenty of flavor. The salads were okay, nothing special. The drinks are definitely where I think this place earns its street cred. I had a Sapphire martini that was easily one of the best I've had in a long time. Not sure what they did different than most places but it worked! The bruschetta was also very good. The place has an old school Vegas feel that is really nice. It's definitely a place that will be worked into our rotation when we visit Las Vegas. The only drawback really is parking. It's on a one way street that only has valet but in the end that's not really a big deal.",

They dropped a load of mashed potatoes on our plate. It was just purely tasteless. I had to ask for butter just to give it flavor. And, it is SO LOUD! I just hated it.",

    "text": "It is always nice to find a good restaurant in Las Vegas which is located outside of casino, so you don't need to roam through a crowd and rely on a questionable signs which tend to disappear on you. Triple George is located near the old Las Vegas Main Street, and had been around for a while. Inside, very nice ambiance of an old steakhouse with modern flair. We were sitting in the booth, which allows for a nice, quiet conversation. Good wine list with large selection and what is most important for me, reasonable prices. Had Willamette Valley estate Pinot Noir which was just spot on. We had steak tartar as an appetizer, and it was very tasty - perfect set of spices to create very nice flavor. We also shared a Wedge salad (head of iceberg lettuce with sauce etc.) which was very tasty. My main dish was small 5 oz steak fillet and shrimp. Shrimp were cooked perfectly, but the steak, which I asked for medium-rare, was closer to medium, but most importantly, was reminiscent of liver in the flavor (was also lacking the sauce). My dining companion had Cioppino, and it was very flavorful. Very nice, friendly service. Recommended.",

    "text": "There are plenty of steakhouses in Vegas, but what sets them apart are the food, prices, location, and service. Although the Triple George Grill does fine with the first three categories, it really shines in the fourth.  My husband made a reservation for our anniversary. I asked to be surprised, and I was. Triple George never crossed my mind. It's located pretty close to Fremont Street, so there were a few goofballs out on the sidewalk. But inside was a different story. This was a classy joint. And the tall wooden booths offered a sense a privacy, even though the restaurant itself was pretty loud. (It reminded me a bit of the Palm at the Forum Shops, without all the caricatures hanging on the walls.)  The food was fine; nothing exceptional but tasty nonetheless. We each had one of the specials. My husband had the seared scallops with rice pilaf ($32), and I had the veal chop with mashed potatoes and grilled shrimp ($45). We split a Caprese salad as an appetizer, and even though it came with regular store-bought tomatoes rather than heirlooms (as far as I could tell), it was a nice clean start to the meal -- and a bargain at $7.95. The best bargain yet? It was half-price wine night (!), so we got a nice bottle of pinot noir for under $30. The prices were right in line with Vegas steakhouse standards, but that wine discount really lightened the load. (So go on a Monday if you're in the mood for some boozin', although our waitress said there is a two-bottle limit per table.)  The service was great throughout. Everyone from the hostess to the sommelier to our waitress was warm and friendly, and each of them also congratulated us on our anniversary in a genuine manner. We even got a complimentary ice cream sundae to mark the occasion, although neither of us put much of a dent in it.  We don't go downtown too often, so I'm not sure when (or if) we'll return to the Triple George. But if you're in the area and you're in the mood for an old-fashioned steakhouse experience, give it a try. (Just please cover your pasties and put on some pants before you enter; we want to keep it classy!)",

Our waiter gave impeccable service and was happy to accommodate my wife changing her mind on her order a few minutes after we told him what we wanted to eat.  He was comfortable attentive throughout the meal as well.  As for the food, my wife had the surf and turf and I the chicken saltimbocca.  She was very impressed by the size and taste of her lobster tail and was very happy with the filet.  My chicken dish was simply delicious and I'd recommend it to almost anybody.  We're going to add Triple George to our downtown Las Vegas short list for places to return for a future meal.",

As we looked around the bar it seemed to be WHAT convention as the bar was half full. Another guest sat next to us asking for the happy hour menu. We noticed a trend of locals being shut down for the convention!  Not a good plan by management to shut the locals out because of a four day event. Might want to think that one out for next year!  Locals visit triple George numerous time a year, where as visitor come and go! Bad business.......",

My husband ordered the Martinique Manhattan and I had the French Revolution. In my husband's words, it was a very unique take on a Manhattan; glad he ordered it but wouldn't order two. I felt the same regarding French Revolution. I like prosecco and St. Germaine, but it was sweeter than desired. (I've become more of a dry wine aficionado).   My husband ordered the special of the night, a Tenderloin Oscar. It was slightly on the salty side, but otherwise really well prepared. It was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.   I ordered the swordfish which was served with a caper buerre blanc sauce, a side of wild rice pilaf and sauteed squash and carrots cut julienne. We both agreed the swordfish was superb. It was tender, moist, and delicious with the perfect amount of caper sauce. I savored every single bite.    I foresee us returning to this restaurant during our next visit to Las Vegas.   For those watching their pocketbook, the meals were about $25 each.",

    "text": "Worst Customer Service Experience in a long time !!  Why ?  Not what I was expecting ( read below )  Food had no Flavor Manager handled situation very unprofessionally    My friend wanted to go out to a nice dinner on New Years Eve, everything was booked except for triple George ( and i can see why now ). She called me and told me she had found this place, so i looked up their menu online and was really looking forward to their fried chicken since i am a sucker for fried chicken !.  Once we arrived their was a pre set menu over their regular menu on the outside and it was $65.00, i wasn't thrilled at all about this but there was also nowhere else to go so decided to give it a shot, we get seated and handed our menu for the night ( only the pre set menu and drink menu ). We ordered our food and it came out in a good timely manner, however nothing had any taste to it, i reached for the salt and yes I spilled it so naturally I threw some over my shoulder lol ( that should have been an indication of how my experience was gonna go ). I let the appetizer and soup go by, I figured the steak and Lobster would make up for it, out comes the steak and lobster with mashed potatoes and asparagus, took a small bit of everything on my plate and . . drum roll please SURPRISE !! No Taste, so i reach for the salt !!. I didn't really want to say anything because i didn't want my friend to feel bad because she picked this place ( I ate everything by now ), but then she complained so I am look phew now I can say something. Finally someone comes over to ask how everything was, so I told the waitress the food was bland, that I had to put salt on everything, she offered to get a manger and at first i told her not to worry about it, BUT as i say no, the people behind us order from the regular menu !! I ask the waitress if the regular menu was available and she said yes, and apologized that no one had told us, so at this point I am like OK, I usually don't do this but yes bring out the manager, and we would like the chocolate cake as our dessert lol. Manager comes out and asks me what seems to be the problem and i explain.  so as if things weren't interesting enough here is where they put the cherry on the top !   The \" Manager \" replies with a \" I'm Sorry \" which I'm like OK thank you, but then he says \" I wish you would have said something sooner \" so he is telling me that there is nothing he can do now ?!  now I am no free loader and not expecting the meal to be comped, but I do like to feel that the establishment is willing to do SOMETHING about it ! I mean anything ! even as to offer maybe a coffee on the house to go with our dessert, but does he ? NO ! then i ask whats up with the regular menu thing and all he can say is :  \" I am sorry for the service you received today, but I can assure you that the next time you come in, you will treated with exceptional customer service \"    WHAT !! this guy thinks I am coming back after this, I don't own a restaurant or a business at the moment but i thought exceptional customer service was suppose to be provided from the beginning, not the next time after you make a complain.  and to top it off after I had a couple bites of the dessert, the waitress comes by and asks if my dessert was good and if it needed any salt ? well I am glad she found humor in the fact that I had to pay $65.00 for something I didn't want and had no flavor, oh and yeah bad customer service.   In the end I was disgusted with this experience, my friend wanted a nice meal for new years eve and you want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time and conversation to bring in the new year, instead we got this. it was difficult to enjoy the rest of the night, but we did, but that doesn't mean I wasn't constantly thinking how bad and how unprofessional this place was.  I will say that this place has potential, I like the layout and has potential to have a good ambiance with both locals and tourists, I hope they get it together.",

We were immediately impressed with the classic retro look tile on the floor and the beautiful dark wood walls, bar and little snuggeries  (small private dining rooms for 6 plus people). The greeting staff made us feel welcome and comfortable immediately.  We were seated and greated by our waiter who was friendly and attentive. We ordered drinks and began to go through the menu . I was impressed with the diversity of its content. Anything you could want from steak, pork. Chicken and sea food. A wonderful selection of old time comfort foods, braised ribs,  chicken pot pie, meatloaf wrapped in bacon, fried chicken. On the table was a fresh baked loaf of sour dough bread and fresh butter.  Drinks came and we're perfectly mixed and served. We ordered our meals and had time to visit. Surprisingly our meals were delivered all at one time and done to perfection I might add.  Our order included fried chicken, chicken saltimbocca, and a George burger which is 3/4 pound of burger bliss.  Everything here is first class. From top to bottom one of the best places to dine in Las Vegas.",

I came along with my son and we had a fantastic experience.  As always, the setting was formal and classy.  Our server Andrew was very attentive and engaging! Case, the manager, was inviting and accommodating, and the food, especially our steak, was exceptional!   We made reservations for 6:45p.  Upon arriving, our Hostess was very friendly, big smile, and guided us to our seats within a minute of arriving.    Andrew was prompt in taking our orders for drinks.  We ordered two Ice Teas, which are truly refreshing and not too sweet for this inferno weather we are experiencing in Las Vegas. I also ordered a Black Cherry Lemon Drop, which is a premiere drink.  Just the right amount of alcohol and NOT watered down.    Once we placed our order, two Rib Eye Steaks, with Caesar Salad x2 and Bruschetta as appetizers, Case the manager came to our table and introduced himself.  Case was very friendly, inviting and demonstrated a desire to ensure patrons were having a good time.  After exchanging some pleasantries and ensuring we were enjoying our experience, Case departed and our appetizers were served within a few minutes of our order.  The Bruschetta is finger licking good!   Then the Rib Eye was served.  All I can say is.....yum!!  I ordered mine Medium and I can say the steak here was prepared with the exact amount of redness...tender and with so much flavor. And those vegetables....i mean if I can cook vegetables like that - I'd become a vegetarian.  The texture, flavor, and seasoning was all just perfect!   Our drinks were always topped off or new glasses kept arriving.  Then desert followed, Lemon Cake and Chocolate Indulgence. I'm a fan of Game of Thrones so I had to try Sansa's favorite.....lemon cake of course.  Rico!  Finally, I just want to thank Case, Andrew and the staff at Triple George Grill for their professionalism and attentiveness to patrons.  This experience was a reflection of my first experience at Triple George Grill - management and staff, working as a team, to provide an exceptional and quality fine dining experience.",

    "text": "As usual, I turned to the best source for restaurant vetting and it felt as if we won the jackpot after the previous night's losses.. Most of the options on Fremont St. felt boring ('old' diners and restaurants) but this place felt authentic and laid back.  We were surprised of the somewhat upscale feeling in this restaurant. Not necessarily the upscale where you need to dress up, but just in terms of cleanliness and politeness that is sometimes rare experience in Vegas due to the tourism that comes in and trash everything and leave with no remorse.   Once seated in a secluded area, the hostess took our drink orders and off we were... Before anything, a basket of warm bread and butter was offered.   We started with the Calamari, which was excellent. We also ordered: - Pot Roast - George's Club - Atlantic Salmon - Chicken Christoper  Every single item was delicious, and we decided to make Triple George Grill a must-stop every time we come back to Vegas.   Winner winner, Triple G dinner.",

    "text": "My in-laws came to visit to meet our new baby boy and we decided that for their last night in town we needed a nice steak for dinner. We wanted to avoid The Strip and it's super high prices, but we still wanted to be in a fun part of town. Triple George absolutely fit the bill! Papa H hadn't been to Vegas since the 70s and he wanted to see how much Downtown had changed. I made a reservation only a couple hours prior on Open Table on a Sunday evening for the five of us. Hubby dropped us at the door so we could get settled, but he had no problem finding a meter right across the street. We were seated shortly after we arrived and our hostess was kind enough to seat us where my in-laws requested.   My in-laws seemed pleased with the drink selection and our servers were hyper vigilant about keeping all of our glasses full.   After we placed our food order, a basket of heavenly soft sour dough arrived at our table. It was accompanied by two soft scoops of butter that sat in pool of sweet juice and seasoning. So good!!  Both couples opted to share a wedge Salad which they split for us. Very thoughtful! And the wedge had that crunch I was craving.   Hubby chose one of the specials of the night - a center cut ribeye and a lobster tail with a side of mashed potatoes and the most enormous asparagus I've ever seen in my entire life.   I opted for the lamb chops. I couldn't believe they give me SIX chops! It was covered in the most deliciously flavorful gravy and accompanied by mashed potatoes and a mix of roasted carrots and squash. The lamb was cooked to medium rare as requested. And because I had so much, I shared quite a bit with hubby. I'm pretty sure he ended up liking what I got more than what he'd ordered for himself.   The mashed potatoes were definitely super buttery and amazing. The carrots were beautiful and simply seasoned. And this unique green squash had very nice, sweet flavor!  While the in-laws were too full for dessert, hubby and I don't know what that phrase means. So he got the Creme Brulee and I got the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. His was the largest serving of Brulee we've ever seen! It was served in a much deeper dish than we're used to, which provided the perfect ratio of custard to sugared top - this was the best Creme Brulee we've ever had!   My cake was smaller in comparison. It was petite, but had a scoop of ice cream equal in size sitting on top of it. While this ice cream wasn't particularly rich or sweet, the cake certainly made up for it!  We were so impressed by this place. It's beautifully decorated and has a great feel. I'd love to go back and try lunch sometime!",

    "text": "First off, our server Monique was an all-star!  Stayed downtown for a couple days so I started browsing for fine dining since it was my friend's birthday. I was very pleased with all the positive reviews and menu selection as far as food and drinks went with TGG so I made arrangements.  After meeting our wonderful server Monique, complimentary bread was brought out along with a plate of butter surrounded by what looked and tasted like Italian salad dressing. (yeah, your secret is out! lol)  For refreshments, we ordered a Cherry Lemon Drop and the Great King George which was their version of an Old Fashioned. Both were really great thanks to the female bartender at the time.  We didn't want to eat much, so we ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, Ribeye, and Petite Filet Mignon and a nice glass of Melbec Red recommended by Monique herself (thumbs up for that). The pie was good but could've been more filling with a whole crust rather than just a layer of crust on top of the pot it came in. The Ribeye was made perfectly! Medium rare throughout the whole steak and was overall just prepped perfectly. Honestly, I was really upset with the last plate..   So Filet Mignons are unique when it comes to cooking. In order to get the best flavor out of it, you must babysit it while it sits on the grill. Afterwards, there has to be a settling phase for the meat to cook by itself from the outside to the inside. Needless to say (see photo), it took 3 attempts to try and get the right temperature. First time was over cooked, second time was under cooked, and the third time also under cooked. It seemed to me that they did not let the meat rest the second and third time, which caused the middle of the filet to be really raw and mushy. That or the meat was not fully thawed out.  Of course the manager (William) came to apologize and was able to kindly make up for the inconvenience by taking care of our drinks. Overall, they tried their best so I can't be too upset. It was the birthday girl who was more upset since it was her Filet Mignon :/  PS: Prices have almost doubled since last year, so don't get too excited when you view the old photo of their menu.",

Those other yelpers who noted that their portions are huge- it's really, really huge.   When my \"cup\" of soup came, it was in what other places would call it a bowl. I had to ask and confirm that I ordered a cup. The guy says, \"yes, this is a cup\". Boom, mind blown. I should've realized at that time that my pot pie wasn't going to be the normal size. You definitely get your money's worth. Okay, enough about portions.   The clam chowder wasn't bad. It has bacon bits for those that do not eat bacon much (like myself). It was tasty, however, ever so slightly on the salty side. B+  Their bread was great, I LOVE warm bread. The butter and olive oil + herbs mix were interesting but worked out. A  Chicken pot pie- Loved how they baked the crust to perfection and it really seemed like a pie. You soon realize that the puff deflates when you poke it. Relief! The flavoring is on point, super creamy. My only complaint was I felt disgusted with how much butter/oil they used... and it was pooling inside my pie. I had to scoop it out onto a plate, but it just kept coming from different sides of the pie when I took another bite. It would've been an A pie, but definitely a B- with the amount of oil.  Service was great, food took a while but our party was big. Overall, I would come back to this restaurant... just skipping the pot pie.  Also, they do have a \"glegan\" menu for you vegans and gluten free people.",

I haven't been to Vegas in over 10 years so I was at the mercy of the \"mob\" on where we would dine.  +/- Pricing: the prices for the food range from 17$ a plate to 60$+ for a plate.  Definitely more expensive than my normal purchases for food.  +/- Entree: I ordered the Pot Roast. Visually on the plate there was a lot of room; just saying what I saw gave off the illusion of \"not enough food\" to fill the plate.  The pot roast came with two good sized cubes of meat accompanied with some carrots, broccoli and mash potatoes.  The food taste wise was excellent, however one of the pieces of meat I received was inconsistent when compared to the first piece I ate which was excellent!  The second piece I ate was dry and on the other end of the spectrum unlike the first piece.  The carrots were excellent, broccoli was just steamed from what I could tell and the mash potatoes were perfecto!  +/- Overall: based off the total experience I would say a solid 4/6 on my rating scale.  Good food but a little on the pricey side.  Try it out though.  The vibe is nice.  Cheers,  LM",

    "text": "Outstanding dinner in downtown Las Vegas. The bartender mixes an excellent Manhattan, and the whole place is welcoming without being cloying. Beautiful long U-shared bar, tucked-away seating, and some alcove booths, too. We started with the aforesaid Manhattan, had the porcino ribeye and the veal chop, which were both delicious and sizable. Might not have need the beet salad starter we ordered, but it was fine too. With the entrees came mashed potatoes and some vegetables; we ordered sauteed spinach that was slightly garlicky and tasty too.  And then, the special rum bread pudding for dessert.  Price reasonable, and we rolled out of there satisfied. This is just about as good a choice as the Barrymore, and easy walking distance to all the Fremont Street-area hotels.",

I admit the restaurant is a little loud, but definitely a fun place to hangout with friends and enjoy the night out without the craz in typical Vegas and I don't have to sell my kidneys to eat here with the same quality of services and food. And Even it is a steakhouse, it also has wide varities of seafood and appetizer to choose from. It definitely made my day.",

Although its managements fault for not training staff properly. -it took 8 minutes for our female server or even anyone to acknowledge we were sitting there.  -side dishes are not listed on menu, although server thought they were and tried to find them on menu, only not to be there. -if we were told vegetables were served with  the steak we would not have ordered the vegetable plater. - I ordered the porcini rubbed ribeye. BAD IDEA. That was my fault. Ribeye has great marbleization and flavor, you don't need a mushroom rub to over power it. It was not enjoyable. My server was great in offering something else. I played it safe with filet. Female Management came over to apologize and handled the situation perfectly.  - chocolate desert was nothing great.   I'm giving 1 star for decor and 1 one for the way management handle situation.  The food was not memorable in only that it was lousy.  When I had to sign for the check I was given a payday loan pen to sign ... How tacky   Thank goodness I had a full comp. I'll give this place another year before I go back.  The server had to big of a station. Under staffing can lead to failure. It was a Thursday night.",

Appetizer: Calamari- Although cooked well the calamari was oily and greasy and the dipping sauce was sparse  Entree: Filet Mignon- My filet was caked in a really heavy gravy of some sort...probably to mask the charcoal taste of the burnt outside. Inside was cooked well and tasted fine  Also one of my pet peeves occurs when management visits every table in the entire facility to ask how dinner is going and purposely skips you. Really irks me as I feel that my money is just as good as others.   To be honest I don't know why this place has four stars? The DTLV hipsters must be drinking some of this place's kool aid",

    "text": "First we had reservations but didn't need them. They were not full and there was no wait time.  This should have been a clue. Our server was Brian #100031. He was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Started off with Calamari. The Calamari was OK, nothing special here. It's served with two sauces, the Aioli tasted like mayonnaise with little seasoning, the spicy red sauce was less than spicy.  You could taste a little, but not really classified as spicy.   My wife had the Porcini Ravioli, she loved it.  The sundried tomato cream sauce carried the porcini flavor, not sure if the mushrooms were present in the sauce or if it picked up the flavors from the ravioli. Must likely they added mushrooms to the sauce. She liked it so much she forgot (maybe on purpose) to let me try a part of a ravioli. It might be because the portion was small. Or visiting guest had the Atlantic Special and she definitely liked her dish since she cleaned the plate. I did not go in for a taste for fear I would lose a digit or maybe my whole hand. No for the reason for losing a star. My main course was Spicy Shrimp and Scallop Linquine. First there was no spice, I mean none,  The sauce is listed as a creole cream sauce, this was the most bland sauce I have ever had.  Olive Garden does better and I hate that place(except for the endless salad). I don't think they even added salt to the dish. The Shrimp looked like it had seasoning but I could not taste any and the scallops were the waste I have ever had. They had a grayish look to them and both(yea I said both, that's all you get 2) were both very gritty, I think they dredge them in sand before cooking them in rancid butter or they don't check the product form the vendor. Just so you know I did not complain about my meal, I am usually offered a free desert and I'm usually to full to eat desert. I just won't go there again and especially to an out of town guest.  They probably should get 3 stars based on misrepresenting a meal and having it so digusting.",

The Cioppino was very tasty and flavorful, the tomatoe soup base with the seafood was great.  It was loaded with mussels, scallops, shrimp, clams, and etc.  The filet mignon was really flavorful and done medium rare really brought out the flavors in that filet.    Dessert was the bread pudding and a brownie cookie.  Both were pretty good, but nothing that stood out as a great dessert.  Service was pretty good, staff was attentive and friendly.",

Got a petite filet minion ($26) and was great. Some might think a bit salty but I enjoyed it. Mashed potatoes were great too.  Also got a Cesar salad. Yes I know....why!?!? Well I was Craving it and now I can tell you all not to get it. Yes yes was not worth it and not a good salad. (Sides I think are around $7)  Overall great place.

Only \"complaint\" was the service.  Our waitress was odd, I wonder what she smoked before she arrived for work.  She doesn't seem to know the sequence of service like checking back at the table to ensure food is correct and that we didn't need anything.  My wife needed more dressing for her salad and she didn't come back until I was almost done with my dinner.  The best part was when she took my napkin (once I was done eating) and proceeded to clean the table with it.  She did earn her 15% because she did the minimum a waitress is expected to do.   It is great to see that Downtown Las Vegas is changing and for the best!  The restaurant is a stones throw from the Fremont Street Experience.    We will definitely be coming back regardless of the mediocre service.  The bar area here looked like a lot of fun so maybe we will have drinks before dinner in the future.",

Everything from appetizer to chocolate souffle was COLD! The first appetizer, a red pepper bisque, was a cream based soup, and it really needed to be warm at least, but it was very cold. The second appetizer, a beef Wellington, was also cold and soggy, also, we had to really look for the beef! There were little bits of beef hidden among the pieces of mushroom. Totally tasteless, but we were hungry. Next, we shared a COLD Tomahawk steak, so cold that the fat (which we trimmed, but still got a lot of) stuck to the roof of our mouths even after dessert. The side dishes were also to be shared, a spoonful of mashed potatoes and THREE asparagus spears for TWO people! Then the COLD chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream on top (it didn't melt even a little). The service was slow (which probably explains the temperature of everything), and our waitress kept asking how our food was, and from the very first course we complained about the temperature, but nothing changed. It was as she was just asking to make conversation, but really didn't care. We'll absolutely never return and will ALWAYS advise our friends and acquaintances to avoid it!",

We had an excellent meal with incredible service; better than anywhere we ate on the strip (and we ate at some of the best).   From the moment we walked in we were treated so well, like regulars almost.  The staff is stellar!  Most specifically, our server Brian was amazing; efficient, patient, and invested in our experience.  We ordered the following:  Appetizer, Crab Cakes- three generous crab cakes, served with marinara.   Unique but very good this way.  The crab was fresh and the cakes were lightly pan fried to perfection.  Salad, Wedge- We shared this, that's how big it was.   The homemade blue cheese dressing was killer!  Entree (1), Porcini Crusted Rib Eye-  First of all, this thing was HUGE (20 oz).  It was just enough sweet, peppery, and very tender.   Served with a side of fresh green beans and huge steak fries (fresh cut).  Entree (2), Filet Mignon- Very nice cut of meat; tender and flavorful with a delicious wine sauce. Fresh green beans and yummy fresh made mashed potatoes served on the side.   Dessert, Extra large Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie- Deliciously warm and moist.   We paired it with some espresso and house coffee.   I highly recommend the Triple George.  It seems as though N. 3rd St is really developing, which is great because Fremont leaves a lot to be desired.",

The apps, salads and onion soup were excellent.  My adult son enjoyed the seafood cioppino, the wife liked the ravioli and the chicken parm was nice.

    "text": "Triple George Grill again receives a 4-star rating. Although not a knock-out the place is a diamond in the rough of downtown Vegas. I treated my husband to a birthday dinner here late on Monday night. We showed up at about 9:20 PM, and it closes at 10 PM, luckily we were not the only patrons still in the establishment as our dining experience went past their closing time.  Our server was a very happy woman who knew her menu very well. Overall the service was 5-stars. Not a problem.  I started off with a White Blend from Napa Valley, CA called Rhapsody, my husband ordered water. The White Blend was... hum, how can I put it? Very close to being atrocious? Of course, this is not the restaurant's fault, it's my fault for having a picky wine palate. Their wine menu features primarily California wines, with a few Italian varietals. No French wine. *clown tear*  Moving on, I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Steak ($23.95), raw, with a side of wild rice, green beans/carrots, and soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna was pretty much perfect. The wild rice was pretty meh. Green beans and carrots - okay.   My husband splurged and got the Porcini Crusted Rib Eye ($41.95). The meat was like butter. Beautifully done. His meal came with mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots. I gotta admit the sides here are pretty disappointing. The menu states that each entree will come with the chef's recommended sides and honestly I'd like to see a bit more creativity with them and also a bit more taste as well. Fortunately the steak made up for it, and it's a damn good thing it did considering the price.  Lastly we required a dessert and my husband picked the M&M Cheesecake. It appeared to the dessert they were serving just for that night because it was not on the dessert menu. It was a lovely cheesecake and the addition of M&Ms was fun. My favorite part was the buttery graham cracker crust!  Overall TGG is a decent dining option, especially for locals who want a nice steak but do not want to head down to the strip.",

    "text": "Went to triple georges last night for our annual visit. This place has always been a must go place while my family is in vegas. Last night was just ok to me. The bartender was not friendly and they only offer happy hour at the actual bar (no bar tables). For dinner time the place was really empty! Our server was amazing and put up with us very well I believe his name was Jared or Justin. Our food was very good even though I asked for my steak medium and it was in between rare and medium rare and I had to switch with my hubby.   The main reason I took away a star though is because they had a cocktail list and the cocktail I wanted they said they were out of the main ingredient. Then when I went to order another bar drink they didn't have that either. I don't know for such a pricey restaurant I was disappointed they didn't have the 2 things I really wanted.",

    "text": "Triple George Grill has redeemed itself. After management reached out, I gave the restaurant another try, and I'm certainly glad I did. My lunch today was amazing! I ordered the power lunch, which is a really great deal: $15 for a half sandwich, soup or salad, choice of side, dessert bite, and a drink. I had the tuna salad sandwich and the clam chowder. It was the perfect sized portion for a hearty lunch, but not so overfilling that I cannot return to work.   The service today was exceptional. The management and wait staff ensured our table had everything we could need, even before asking. This is the kind of experience TGG's reputation maintains, and I'm happy I was able to experience it before crossing this restaurant off of my list indefinitely because of a fluke last time.   The downtown Las Vegas area has limited nice restaurants for working professionals within walking distance of the courthouse. So, it is great to know that this restaurant can be a regular stop for me and my coworkers. I look forward to coming back and I will never forget the commendable customer service I received from the manager after I had a negative experience. I'm truly impressed and thus, I happily update my review to give TGG the 5 stars it deserves.",

I have enjoyed amazing premium steaks (mostly rib eyes) here for less than 40 dollars with sides, and it's right in the heart of downtown Las Vegas. Upon entering, you feel like you are stepping into a classic steakhouse with great smells and mood lighting (not too dark though). They have a staff that is friendly, and well dressed. They are busy but always happy to help. Parking is 4 dollars at Binions across the street and free if you validate in the casino. Only issue I have had is one steak was served over-cooked from the way it was ordered and we didn't send it back or even let them know until the end of the meal because even over cooked it was delicious. Due to the large party we had and in the spirit of good customer service, he took it off of our bill without us asking. I hope this place stays there forever. Great job Triple George!",

Apart from that, the food is absolutely fantastic as is the service. Another thing that keeps me coming back is the comfortable seating.  So if you require excellent fare that is prepared using fresh ingredients, Triple George is your place. It's quiet and relaxing as well. After that, if you are in the mood for something loud, you can head over to hogs and heifers for some drinks and rock and roll.(next door)  Oh, there is motorcycle and scooter parking in front of h & h, which makes it convenient for giving your money to both places.",

    "text": "Wait staff is Inconsiderate, Rude, and Entitled.  I had heard good things about this place, and I had some time, so I decided to order some take out on the way home.   This is a break down of the rude encounters with the staff:  1) The first person to greet me was one of the bartenders. He asked me \"Are you OK?\" and then while I was answering walked away and never came back.  2) Second bartender asked me what I needed. I answered \"I placed a to go order\" and he said \"no problem, it's not quite ready would you like to pay for it\" I gave him my card and when signing for it attempted to give him a dollar and asked \"Could you please just make sure there is plastic-ware in there?\" He looked at the dollar with a look of disgust and walked away without accepting the dollar. I was like I guess my dollar is not good enough for you. He never even came back to take the receipts while I was there either.  Side Note:  I worked as a server and know the face of waitstaff when they think they deserve a 20 percent gratuity even if service is poor. This was a to-go order so I felt no obligation to give him anything, but wanted to give him something for taking the time to take the order.   If you break it down, 1 dollar for about a minute of work, it is still 60 dollars an hour. He should be trying to get more of these types of orders so he can make tips on the side for very little work.  3) I waited for my food and it took about 15 minutes sitting at the bar to be asked if I wanted some water or something to drink from a third person. All I was thinking at this point was like \"what is with these people?\"  4) Now a fourth person started to hand me my order. This guy didn't even say a word to me the entire brief time I was near him. I asked \"Is that the order for Ryan?\" as he walked up. All he did was set it down and he gave me another look as if to say \"You are not wanted here.\" I said thank you and finally left feeling like this is the rudest staff I have ever dealt with.   I have never had such a bad experience at a place that I felt like I needed to say nothing about the food and everything about the rude staff. I can't believe that these people even work in the food and beverage industry. They don't treat people with the basic amount of respect or kindness.  The food was very good, but I will never go back to Triple George just because of the way the staff treated me.",

You get it in a big 'ole cone with two dipping sauces.  One is cocktail, the other tasted like something tartar-y, but better.  The breading was perfect, not too heavy, well spiced, and crispy.  The portion was really generous too for a $5 special.  I would totally order this again.  The wedge salad, also good, was a good find.  I generally order a wedge wherever and whenever I can find it.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers, no bacon is WEIRD.  I feel like Triple George Grill is intentionally messing with everyone when they present a lovely wedge but NO bacon.  Shenanigans.  The \"American Mule\" was tasty but not strong at all.  I appreciated that it was served in the traditional copper mug but I'd order a regular price drink next time in order to actually get some alcohol.  Overall, good service, good food, world's longest bar, all good.",

    "text": "We were downtown because we just checked out the mob museum and we decided to have dinner. We saw triple George and decided to eat outside since the weather was really nice. The food was great and the ambiance was perfect up until a lady beside us started screaming bloody murder because a RAT bit her toe. It was so disgusting! I'm terrified of rats and granted it was outside and not in their restaurant itself but since that seating area was for the restaurant patrons there should be no rodent within the vicinity. Luckily my husband and I already finished our food. The mussel appetizer very good however I don't think we will be back because I don't like the pets they keep near the restaurant. Such a shame since before the whole rat incident I told my husband we might've found a new spot. What a disappointment! FOOD WAS EXCELLENT THOUGH.",

The manager came out and said he was actually cooking the food, which I thought was strange. The worst part was that they weren't  busy....at all.

Avoid the terrible casino restaurants and trendy tourist bar/grills on Fremont by taking a short walk to Triple George!     Triple George is a classy, relaxed, old school steak and seafood house.  They're not pushing a fancy chain restaurant name or luring customers with plastic guitar bodies filled with rum and punch.    Those in the know go to Triple George for a great steak, a great piece of seafood, a great beer or glass of wine.  You won't find Triple George to be a super fancy dining experience but you'll find yourself in a very comfortable upper-scale atmosphere with simply plated food that will speak for itself.  I'm always happy after Triple George!........ Never mind the biker bar next door :o",

We were seated immediately as it was relatively empty at 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday evening. The air conditioning unit was being repaired and it was very cold when we entered. We were given our choice of seating and were immediately greeted by our serving team of Phil and Brendon. I ordered a house gin martini and it was offered with blue cheese olives which is an extra special touch for me. I ordered a cup of French onion soup as a starter. It was good but some parts of the soup were just warm and other areas were very hot as if maybe it was microwaved. I ordered the 8 oz filet, rare, with a side of broccolini. My steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender. My husband ordered a hamburger and he said it was delicious. It was very large and came with cheese and bacon on it as well as a side of fries. Unfortunately we were so full from our entrees that we had no room for dessert. our meal definitely did not disappoint nor did the wonderful service.",

Tip: for privacy, get a booth. Our server, Derek, was on point the entire night, as was his assistant who made sure our drinks were never empty and our needs we're met. I had the buttermilk fried chicken. This was, perhaps, the BEST friend chicken I have had in many, many, years. My husband had the meat loaf. He needs comfort food and I'm not cooking it, so I'm thrilled to have found a place that rivals his mother's cooking. We had two other people, both locals, who also loved the meal.

The manager came by right when we got our food and asked if we needed anything, I said I will let you know, he said that's not what I asked! REALLY! Do you not oknow customer service? I will not recommend or come back to this restaurant!",

I hate for this to be a one-and-done but I think it might be ! I didn't get the bartender's name but he had some huge ear plugs in and he knew I really didn't like some of that food, but didn't offer to do anything about it...not a good idea.",

Exactly the opposite of the typical flashy Vegas establishment.  We went in for some take-out sandwiches, expecting them rolled up in paper with a couple plastic forks thrown in.  No sir, what they gave was freshly prepared sandwiches in their own boxes, the fries in separate boxes so they would not go limp, quality paper napkins and quality recyclable forks etc, all beautifully packed in a nice big shopping bag that you could happily carry into a high end store.   Well done!",

They had ample room to accommodate the big group and the wait wasn't bad but we did make reservations via the online app before hand though. Service and drinks from the bar were great. Not a big wine person but I felt they had a decent selection. Now on to the steaks they cooked a little bit more rare side, but delicious. Felt the steaks were a bit over seasoned with their house seasoning but still a tasty steak. I prolly would come back here.",

We read about the sea salt caramel martini they serve there, and being Scandinavians we love everything salty.  We came around 10 in the evening and noticed the nice atmosphere at once.  There were dining seats in a horse shoe around the bar, and seats by the bar if only drinking.    We got our martini quickly, but it was made properly by a professional and nice bartender.  She somehow reminded me of Sandra Bullock and we had a nice chat on how Aria hotel has the best scent there is.  So, salty caramel?  Omg,  I would loooove to have another. Now!  Will come back in a year and have dinner also.",

It exceeded my expectations. All the food was well executed.   Calamari - It was crispy and hot - a great starter for a group.  Shrimp George - crab-stuffed shrimp w/a lemon butter sauce I loved the combination of the crab stuffing with the shrimp and the sauce brought it all together.   Petite Filet Mignon - It was cooked to perfection and the vegetables and mashed the potatoes really complimented the dish.  Chocolate Cake - a decadent way to end a great meal.  All the servers were really nice and helpful. I definitely recommend Triple George Grill for a delicious dinner in downtown that's a lot more affordable than eating on the Strip.",

I do enjoy that when you walk in you feel like the atmosphere of outside changes. They have multiple dinning areas and can accommodate a good size group.  If you are downtown and want to grab a good meal I'd highly suggest the Triple George.",

One of the downsides of Vegas is the amount of steakhouses and obscene prices.  Triple George's has a little of everything.  A petite filet ran only 28.95!  And it was cooked to perfection.  A colleague of mine got the lamb chops and those were also excellently cooked.  The cocktails were ok.  They old fashion tasted watered down too much ice.  The sides were all great we had creamed spinach, mushrooms, and asparagus.  I would recommend the onion soup.  The shrimp cocktail wasn't anything special for the price but that's about the only thing.  Overall the setting quality of meat and service got them a 5 Star.",

But frankly skip the idea of dinner based on our dinner last night (pre-Hamilton show).   First off we ordered a glass of Malbec. Never have sent a wine back before but this one was really off. Never saw the bottle but either it was a cheap version or just wrong.  Given that start, we didn't want to compound the situation by sending dinner back but should have. Asked if Ahi Tuna was high quality. Waiter said absolutely. Foolishly believed her and asked for very rare. The entree both smelled and tasted fishy which is usually not the case with good quality. Worse, it tasted terrible and looked like it had freezer burn around the edges.  Maybe shame on me for ordering fish at a Vegas grill, but if you don't buy quality don't sell it. We won't be back for dinner again, way too many better choices downtown.",

    "text": "We were near Downtown Las Vegas and wanted to have dinner in a place where we were not going to be fed touristy food. We found TRIPLE GEORGE GRILL on Yelp and headed there to see if it fit the bill. Hubby wanted salmon and there it was right on the menu so we took a chance. Inside we found the place reminiscent of an old school steakhouse---lots of dark woods, linen covered tables  and enclosed private booths. We snagged one of those booths--lucky for us. Brenda our server brought us delicious sourdough bread with butter on a separate plate that had a pool of pink sauce around it. This sauce turned out to be an addictive, delicious dipping sauce for the bread. It was REALLY good. The Cajun salmon came with a rice pilaf that tasted like southern dirty rice as well as some sauteed veggies. The salmon portion was quite ample and deliciously prepared. My order was chicken pot pie and it was classically prepared with celery, peas, carrots potatoes and pearls onions amidst the chunks of chicken. Cream was used which made it deliciously rich. It came in what seem to be a cast iron mini pot which was topped by puff pastry. A delicious GUINNESS was the beverage of choice and even with that we made room for dessert --flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. KABOOM!  A Home run !  Our server was spot on making sure that all was well and that our waters were topped.  At the end of our meal, the owner came by to ask how our meal was and of course we expressed our delight with his restaurant.  When in Vegas, look this place up.  You won't be sorry.",

Mashed potatoes were ok. They had that grainy texture. The seasoned veggies were pretty good. The pot roast was a bit too salty for my taste. The chicken was a bit bland although very moist and tender. My husband took a few bites of his chicken and was done. He did however finish his vegetables. Service was very attentive and they promptly refilled glasses as soon as they got about half full. If we're ever here again we'd probably try different items.",

The atmosphere is really nice and calm in the afternoon, but noisy at night.  It has a nice old school kind of feel to it.    The Best Things: - Pot roast - Spinach artichoke dip - Oysters (omg) - Shrimp George - French onion soup (which is dinner only now for some reason??) -Special menus to match Smith Center shows.  They did a Shrek themed menu in 2012 that was fantastic and fun.   Not My Favorite: - Seasonal side vegetables are never cooked enough and are tough -Fish and Chips- can't really put my finger on it, but fish didn't seem cooked all the way through) - No more valet parking, now you have to park in the Grand's garage, although TG does validate.",

Based on the way our server, Ceclie, treated 8 of us locals at Triple George last night, apparently having locals as partons is not important to Cecial! Not only did she provide sub-par service (slow, inaccurate, didn't visit the table much at all - had to go to the bar to buy drinks because she didn't come around at all to ask if we needed anything!), but she wasn't satisfied with the automnatic gratuity added for parties of 8 or more - and made sure to call us all a nasty name as we left. She didn't do her job, and quite frankly, wouldn't have gotten much if any of a tip from us if it hadn't been imposed by the restaurant.  The food took longer than usual and was way too salty - not just one meal - the soups and everyone's meal! Not that our waitress cared - she didn't even stop by to ask how everything was tasting!  We have all gone there for years - and may not ever go back after this! Disappointed doesn't even scratch the surface!  So you know we are not only complainers, the bartenders, Todd and Marty, and the porter, Eddie, were spectacular as ALWAYS! The manager, Chance, was very nice and took good care of us.",

My soup and my partner's salad were not served together and I had to catch the server to get the salad to the table so we could both have a course together.   Beefsteak tomato salad was cold tasteless tomato slices with bad dressing over a soggy piece of lettuce (are you kidding me?).  As for the entree, She advised me that they serve the Ahi rare.  I explained that I wanted the center rare, but the outside charbroiled.  She or the kitchen ignored that and I had to send it back.   It wasn't re-prepared the way I asked and I complained to the server.  The manager came over and I explained my legitimate complaint.  He was sorry, but offered no compensation (or understanding of Ahi tuna)  ... what was the point of him coming over to us?????  I understand that this happens repeatedly with other diner's reviews.  Con:  Kitchen staff is apparently not overseen by an executive chef.  Whoever is working there is not trained properly.  Oysters were just ok.  The bisque had chunks of lobster (or crab - not clear on that), but it had a film over it as if it was canned Campbell's and twice as salty.  Charbroiled Ahi tuna was never charbroiled and only the outer 1/2 millimeter was cooked.... the outside area is supposed to be charred and the center red... that is every chef's way of preparing it.  Shrimp George - crab stuffed shrimp - we needed a search party to find any trace of crab... and no broiled, but soggy!  Con:  Atmosphere was a sports bar ... not a 4 star restaurant as some odd food reviewers gave it.  We spent $120. only to be disappointed in every aspect.  I could go on and on, but you get the point... read the reviews of people who are used to better dining experiences.  Recommendations: Don't expect what the menu professes to be fine dining - NOT SO!  No value for your dining dollar.  Stay away.",

The servers were absolutely great and service was super fast. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. Our food was just as good on the second visit. We used the valet parking at the downtown Gran and played a few slots in there, also a nice place. After diner we walked one block to Fremont Street. Triple George was absolutely off the hook. Hope every experiences it the same way we did.",

The crab baked stuffed shrimp was some of the best seafood have had in this town. It's a bit pricey but worth it based on that dish.  Glad I took that suggestion and ran with it. Must have been good for me to remember the name of it too. I will be back.",

Well, I would have tried it at least, but I have not smoked for 1 year now and didn't want to push my luck! We sat at the bar for dinner, which was really just salads BUT THEY WERE AMAZING! I think we all had the chopped salad and considering it was stinking hot outside that really hit the spot! The waiter was fantastically amusing! And attentive. The drinks were generous and I'm sure the good tips we left didn't hurt our service!   Next visit I would love to sit in one of the little booths because it looked really romantic. Well, old Vegas style romantic. Dark wood, soft lights, great atmosphere!   Later we went and sat outside so the boys could smoke and the patio was great as well. Much entertainment watching the folks at other extablishments...quite amusing! We are actually all bikers, so being next to that other place gave us a great view of some pretty awesome bikes. But we much prefer the ambiance of Triple George, I  guess we are just a sophisticated lot! LOL!  The boys tired out early and rode off on their bikes leaving us girls to entertain ourselves! We wandered next door to the Sidebar, which I guess is \"related\" to the George! The music was hopping and the crowd was a little young for me, but they were amusing and did not seem offended that us \"old folks\" were hanging out there! A little bit of dancing in that small space was enough for me, but the music and videos were hopping! Very much enjoyed our time there!   My group intends to make Triple George a regular part of our Fremont Fridays! I can't wait to try it again, as soon as I stop galavanting around the country and stay home on a Friday night!",

A couple of my favorites are the Ahi salad and the George burger for lunch and the 10 under $10 is also a great value. Can't go wrong with any of those choices either. The baby back ribs are great. As far as happy hour the lemon drop packs a serious punch! But I've tried quite a few of their other martinis and never been disappointed. At this point I think I have tried almost every appetizer but I am a fan of the wings and the calamari.

A relish tray is placed on your table right away with hot sourdough bread.  A variety of wines to choose from. No matter how full you think you are, you have to try a dessert. The cheesecake is a slice big enough to share. The chocolate cake is made for chocolate lovers and the creme brule is perfect.

He was also great about checking back with us and asking us how everything was without being too present. I think his name was Ryan? Definitely a great server. The seating is pretty awesome too, especially if you're on a date. They have semi-enclosed booths that are great for a more private dining experience. The food was pretty good. We got the NY strip and the Cioppino. For the price I expected the Cioppino to have a little more shellfish and not so many onions and peppers. The steak had great flavor and was cooked as ordered. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the bartender. I myself can be quite a loud talker but the restaurant was very quiet and she was talking to her two guests at the bar so loudly that it ruined the experience for us. The bar isn't far from the tables but the whole dinner we got to hear about her allergies and how she loves to drink and how she doesn't fit in with the people in Austin. I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and I completely understand connecting to and having a conversation with your guest. And to her credit she was friendly but her speaking voice was so ridiculously loud we could barely have our own conversation. We actually rushed through our meal just so we could get out of there! The last thing I want to hear about when I'm eating dinner is how sick you got the last time your allergies flared up. There's a fine line between outgoing and obnoxious. If we went back we'd be sure to sit further away from the bar. Overall decent food and good service.",

I swore never to go back after the first time I ordered the rib eye medium rare and it arrived somewhere between medium and medium well.  When I complained that it was over cooked, the waitress offered, \"maybe it's because you are sitting close to the window\" as an explanation.  Today my boyfriend and I both ordered the rib eye medium rare.  When they arrived mine was much thicker and over cooked and his was as thin as the $14.99 t-bones you get at local casinos and was cooked fine.  The goat cheese appetizers is something that could be in a 7 year old child's microwave cookbook (mom doesn't need to help as long as you use plastic and no metal):  Simply take the cheese out of the plastic,  top with some spaghetti sause and nuke for 1:30 minutes on high.  The desserts are sad as well.  Actually, everyone liked the bread and it was served hot.",

We wanted somewhere good to go for dinner since it was my boyfriends birthday and landed on this place.  It was either here or Binions Steakhouse since we were downtown.  However we were a little spooked about Binions now being at the top of a closed hotel and having mixed reviews so we decided to try Tripple G.  We had heard it was locals spot.  We were pleasantly surprised at how awesome it was.  We guarantee we will be back many times in the future.  They had a surf and turf special which was a split lobster and 10 once filet with truffled mash which we both decided to have and it was well worth the price.  $42 dollars which you would never get on the strip and even if you did it it would never be that good.  We also each got a Ceasar Salad which was fresh and excellent..   Our waiter Brian and his Assistant Andrew were incredible as well.   This was one of those restaurants you can't find in our area anymore.  A good local restaurant with good cooking that is a little more upscale but not pretentious.  The dress code is casual fine dining so you don't have to be uncomfortable while you have an excellent meal.   This is one place you have to try!",

The wine list was very nice, and friends that were with us ordered Mojitos that they said they were made perfectly. First of all they brought the most amazing bread with whipped butter, olive oil, and fresh herbs. It was so good we ate all of it! The bread and wine were worth the trip by themselves.  Our appetizers were Seared Ahi and Spinach Artichoke Dip, both were really really good. Again the garlic bread that was paired with the dip was perfect. My husband had the Sage Fried Chicken, he said it was excellent. I had the Pot Pie.... yum yum yum. It was really good, creamy full of flavor, I really recommend trying it. The other couple with us had the Chicken Fettuccine and the Crab Stuffed Shrimp. Both of the dishes looked great and our friends were raving about how much they liked the dishes as well. We are going back next week!",

    "text": "We go here for special dinners: birthdays and anniversaries. The place has a great vibe but can be a little noisy during peak times as there is a huge horseshoe bar and everything is out in the open. It feels more like a place in San Francisco or New York than glitzy Las Vegas. Service was good and the food came out at about the right pace. I have had steaks and the lamb chops before so I thought I'd try the blackened salmon. The server said the salmon was fresh and \"very nice.\" It was a good choice. The fish was cooked perfectly but the blackening seasoning was just  touch over done, too strong. The veggies were cooked perfectly. The rice had a fairly strong flavor I can't describe. I would have liked the flavor a little lighter. I had The clam chowder and it was good, not super great but I would order it again. The creamed spinach had a very cheesy flavor. It was good but I really like the creamed spinach at Lawry's and nothing compares to that. My wife had the crab stuffed shrimp and loved it. There were huge shrimp with ample amounts of crab. She has this dish every time and was not disappointed. I was lucky because she shared on with me and I also loved it. The steaks are a little pricey, but in the past they have been exceptional. Having the salmon was the first time I've not had either a steak or lamb and I discovered the entire menu has a great deal of appeal. We really like this place and give it a strong recommendation. Make a reservation and go around 6:00pm as the place gets very busy later in the evening.",

I had the crab stuffed shrimp (Shrimp George) and my meal was delicious. I also ordered the clam chowder which was light and not too rich, which I prefer. My party ordered the cioppinno, New York steak, and a spicy seafood dish. We shared a molten chocolate cake for dessert. We all walked away content.   One note: we sat outside in the front and it was a little chilly- the heaters didn't do much. It can also get a little noisy with the pizza place patrons from next door and the bike bar nearby. Next time, I would wait a few minutes for a table to clear up inside, especially for something more intimate. I walked in to use the restrooms and pass the bar it's very pretty inside where the tables and booths are.",

I ordered the Ahi Tuna charbroiled and when it arrived it was only slightly pan-seared and pretty much raw and horrible tasting. The manager was called over, tuna taken back to the kitchen and did not get back to me fully cooked until the rest of my party had already finished eating and we needed to leave for another engagement.  Since I really did not get to eat my dinner with my party I figured the manager would remove the cost from my bill but he did not. Manager was summoned and when asked why I received only a puzzled look and no answer. The rest of my party enjoyed their dinner. I left totally unsatisfied with a raw fish taste still in my mouth.

The bar takes up an entire room! Drinks were great and strong.  Nice ambiance and good acoustics despite it being a packed house the night we went (it was first Friday which is apparently crazy in Freetown). Prices were great and easily half what we would have paid for a comparable spread in the strip. Hubby and I shared the pot roast; our friends got the shrimp and pasta and roast chicken. Pot roast had a generous serving of roast, was ultra-flavorful and a steal IMO at $16. Our companions were very happy with the chicken and the shrimp.   4 stars only because our server, while nice, had a distributed section and was not near us a lot so we had to flag down a different server to get his attention a couple times. He was really nice and attentive when he came by, but clearly having tables in different sections was tough on him (he was sweating when he came by). Definitely not his fault but something management might consider on busy nights.  We'll definitely stop back next time we're in Vegas!",

First time back in about 2 years and it was \"just ok.\"    Just ok would get 3 stars if it was the local buffet and I was expecting \"just ok.\"   But, at a place with such a good reputation and at this price point, \"just ok\" gives you 2 stars.    The appetizers were blah.  So, by the time our dinners came out (after about double the time we would expect), we were hungry and ready for some great food!   Neither of us was happy - neither her with her chicken or me with my steak.  I won't go on about each, but as an example of our disappointment:  half way through my poorly seasoned, overdone steak, I turned it over and saw what you see in the photo.   No steak, no matter how well-done (mine was supposed to be medium) should look like this.",

It was close to 9pm we came for a late supper while visiting Old Vegas, a short walk away, I ordered the Rib Eye steak it was so tender and flavorful I had an instant orgasm lol. Only mistake to my steak was that I ordered it medium well, but came out medium rare, it was so good i didn't care i was hungry and did not want to ruin the flavor by reheating. Drinks were quite pricey  but with a delicious meal being served and reasonably priced its easy to overlook the drinks. Was not fussy on the desserts either. Overall great food but the rest falls to good catagory.",

The baked goat cheese marinara ($10.95) was heavy on the cheese, light on the marinara, and came with more than enough toast. The chicken parmesan ($14.95) was pretty good, but similar to a million other versions of the dish. It was something that we could have gotten anywhere else. Last up was the filet mignon ($30.95). It was a nicely charred, tender cut that was cooked medium rare, as ordered with some buttery and garlicy mashed potatoes along with green beans and carrots.   The atmosphere makes for a nice chill place for locals to hang out and the isolated booths that run along the bar make for an ideal place to have an intimate dinner where you can actually sustain a conversation despite the loud crowd noise from the bar.",

And let me just tell you, Triple George did not disappoint at all. The prices are pretty high, but that's to be expected from a good steak house.  We parked at the Grand Casino across the street at their Valet parking and walked through the Casino straight across the street from Triple George....they validate parking so it was free.  When we got there, the hostess was very nice and welcoming. They accommodated our party which consisted of a wheelchair and stroller. Because of the holiday, the Chef had prepared a special 4 course meal, however after looking at everything included, we decided to order off the menu. The four course meal would have been too much food for all of us.  Around the table we had New York Steaks, Prosciutto with Chicken, Grilled Chicken, and a seafood pasta. None of the dishes disappointed....they were delicious to say the least. Our waiter was great and the manager came by to see how we were doing. The ambiance was warm and welcoming. When you walk in all you see is the bar, but behind the dark wood walls are more tables that seem like a great romantic setting for a first date.....    After enjoying our dinner, we ordered Creme Brulee and a New York Cheesecake which we all shared. All the desserts were exquisite. Next time you're looking for a Steakhouse in the Fremont area, stop by Triple George Grill, you'll be glad you did.",

They had a long wait but my girlfriend, her mom, and me found 3 seats at the bar pretty easily.. One side note if you are trying to get close and cuddle with your significant other the bar stools are bolted to the ground and are a little far away from each other so you'll be reaching a bit.   The food was amazing and very reasonably prices for a steakhouse type of restaurant. We had some French onion soup which was amazing, I haven't been a big fan of French onion soup but have been getting into it lately and there's was delicious! The chopped salad unfortunately wasn't anything special, I like those real finely chopped ones and theirs was kind of just like chunky chopped. We had some chicken with crazy and mashed potatoes which was awesome the chicken was very flavorful. My girlfriends mom said that the chef was a little heavy handed on the pepper on each dish we tried, I like pepper so I didn't really notice.   The only negative comment I have is that our waiter didn't check on us as often as I would have liked, this normally doesn't bother me but there were a few moments where we needed some things and I couldn't even get his attention. I know they were busy but if I'm trying to get your attention and I can't get it easily that kind of sucks, it took a few minutes and we also waited to get our check for a while even after our plates sat empty for about 15 minutes. Overall though the food was great atmosphere is classic and the staff was friendly.",

We then move from the bar area to our table where we continued the nice service we had in the bar. we orderd the chop salad and split it. I had a beautiful Rib Rye. My husband had the lamb chops. Both entries were cooked to perfection. Service was great. Entrees were brought to the table by the manager. There was a slight mixup in our order, but everything  was great even with the wrong entree. Too full for deserts, maybe next time. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town.",

    "text": "I was looking for a nice dinner before attending an event at the Smith Center.  My girlfriend and I decided on the Triple George Grill.  We started the evening with Sex on the Beach and Scotch on the rocks for her.  That gave us time to take in the decor.  I love the old high end steakhouse type of feel about the place.  The cute guys at the bar were nice to look at too!  We were seated at a booth that was very private, so I made a mental note for a future date night with the boyfriend for later.  I love restaurant layouts that provide an intimate dining space and you can enjoy the company you are with.    We shared bruschetta with grilled bread that was good but in my opinion was a little too heavy with the balsamic vinegar that overpowered the taste of the tomatoes.  We both enjoyed it.  I ordered the filet steak caprese which I have never had anywhere and it was just so great.  The filet tenderloins were cooked medium rare just exactly as I ordered it and layered between mozzarella cheese and tomato slices and a side of arugula.  It was a perfectly balanced meal.  My friend ordered the pot roast with the pan gravy.  There were vegetables served with it and she loved her meal as well.   The service was top rate.  I think we had three service people attending us during the evening.  In the beginning of the evening we told our server we had an event to attend at the Smith Center and he made sure everything came out promptly.  That little detail is very much noted.  Thank you.  I did notice before I ordered there was a 15% discount for a Yelp check in but forgot to mention that when I paid my bill.  But they did validate our parking at 3rd Street and Ogden so that's ok.  I will make sure to use it next time.  I am looking forward to returning again soon and let my boyfried experience it with me.  It was a lovely evening.",

Triple george offers up crusty bread and butter and a little tray of pickled veggies to start.  Hubs and I recently dined pre-theatre.  This is a great spot to go before the Smith Center.  Super quick drive over on Ogden.  Parking gets validated in the third street parking garage.  Easy peezy.    I had the shrimp george and it was absolutely delightful.  5 or 6 big shrimp stuffed with crab, dusted with bread crumbs and baked.  They sat on top of a flavorful lemon butter sauce.  I got wild rice and veggies along side.  The veggies were nice and al dente.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right.  Hubs was very very pleased with his veal and mashed potatoes.  Tender, and well seasoned.  Creme brulee was also a delight!!  Traditional American/steakhouse food seasoned well and cooked right.  Cool bar and patio.  Definitely worth a visit!",

    "text": "Mixed feelings on Triple George, mostly because it was not what I thought it was. I was expecting a darkly lit mahogany lined room with smoke and loud jazz music playing. Why? I have no idea. What I did get was an open room with tv's on the wall (strange for fine dining) with a center bar. I believe there was jazz music playing in the background but it was so loud in the dining area I could barely hear the people at my table.   The food was delicious, I had the Ribeye which was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and was cooked to perfection. It was a steak lovers steak. The sides were creamy potatoes and seasonal vegetables, all were wonderful. Wife had the special Filet Medallions Oscar. We are used to Oscar with crab meat, they offered lobster. The lobster while plentiful, was slightly mushy, not as premium as the meats. The Creme Brulee was the perfect way to end the meal.   The food was a 5, the service (waiter and bus) was a 5 but the ambiance was a 4. The extremely loud and annoying table blowing kazoos next to us was a 0 and the fact that the restaurant did nothing to slow down the extreme noise from the table proved to me management lacked an understanding of who their patrons that night were.   Overall I would have given my experience a 3, but I'm looking past the annoying table behind us and granting the four.",

After a week of seeking out great places to eat, Triple George Grill was easily our favorite restaurant of the trip.  The drinks were smooth and tasty.  Each of us ordered something different from the menu, and all of them were delicious.  The filet and fried chicken were our favorites, but the shrimp and scallops pasta dish and the pot roast were very good.  We sat in the private booths in the bar area, and while that prevented people watching, it allowed us to focus on each other without loud noise or distraction.  Andrew took great care of us, and the staff seemed to work together to provide an excellent dining experience.  We will definitely make it a point to dine there again the next time we are in town.",

    "text": "Amazing!   I had a longer drive than usual into Vegas so I nixed my plans of going out to eat. Checked into the Downtown Grand but wasn't feeling like any of their restaurants ( I forgot the Commissary is now open). The place was a 2-3 minute walk from my room so I called in a take out order at 9:20 (they close at 10). I had read the reviews on Yelp so asked Todd the bartender about  two items. Of th two, he suggested the fried chicken and it was AMAZING...  The take out people even packed it up correctly with the gravy sauce separate which made all the difference because I gambled a bit before going back to my room so the dish was not all soggy...  The dish came with a great mash potato and excellent carrots/green beans I read the reviews here so I asked them for bread and butter...the butter for some reason was a little bland but the sourdough bread was amazing. I appreciate that they didn't pack it until I got there so it was still slighty warm even after I made it to my room 40 minutes later...The dish was already a 10, if I had had it hot/sooner I would it would of been even more Food-gasmic....Its a good thing I will be visiting the fitness center..lol  How much was this meal? $15 including taxes, I tipped $2...sure I lost $20 gambling but I honesty would of paid $30 for some buffet on the strip that was not as good as the meal I had in the comfort of my room...  New fave take out in the downtown area...They also have a nice big bar vintage style to belly up too which I imagine is great for date conversation which is a nice contract to the party bar next door of hogs & heifers. Because I was a party of 1, I probably wouldn't site down and do the formal steakhouse thing which is better in a group....",

    "text": "After spending a grueling day on our feet at the Fremont Experience, my friends and I wanted a place to sit down, relax, and have a drink and a nosh.  One of my friends remembered her daughter saying the Triple George had some great food and drink and since we were a block away from the restaurant, off we went.  My friend's daughter works at The Miracle Mile and knows all the great little places for us to try.  I fell in love with the ambience.  It is old timey ganster.  There was a long bar to sit at if you just wanted drinks or if dinner is on the agenda, there are booths along the wall and tables along the aisle.  The booths were sheltered from the regular restaurant clientele by a divider.  The patrons still saw what was going on in the restaurant, but there was some privacy too.  It was cool!  We were seated at a table along the aisle.  I wasn't that comfortable in the chair, but any seat was feeling good at that point in my evening.  Our super friendly waitress, Denise?, came and took our drink orders and gave us our menus.  What a friendly woman.  It made the experience all the better.  The next thing that happened rocked me to my socks.  Out came a bread basket with piping hot bread and a dish of soft butter.  It hit me where it counts, because when butter comes with the bread in other places, it's hard as a rock and it isn't worth eating.  To compound my surprise, a plate of veggies arrived; cornichons, cherry peppers, pepperoncinis, carrot sticks, and olives.  Incredibly old timey!  I ordered the Grilled Swordfish with sauteed shrimp, rice pilaf, and veggies and was beside myself it was so good.  This was the best piece of fish I have had in a long, LONG time.  Those cooks really put their foot in it!  One of my friends ordered the Grilled Salmon and she loved hers almost as much as me.  I cleaned my plate, she left a few pieces of rice.  My other two friends ordered appetizers and they seemed to be enjoying them.  I'd say Triple George rocks it old time AND big time and I will go back as much as I can in the future.",

Slightly toasted french bread topped with tomato, marinated mozz and fresh basil, it was beyond delicious.  While there, I peeked into a wandered through the last quests of the night enjoying their meals and the ambiance was delightful.  You pretty much forget that you're downtown.  It's dark and intimate without being claustrophobic.  Once, they were grilling some food for free outside when I happened to come by.  I got myself a burger.  As this was a free publicity thing, I wasn't expecting something so think, juicy and wonderful.  If the free food out front is that good, I definitely need to try what's inside.  I'll do that soon and update this review.",

I keep telling myself that I shouldn't eat everything served on my plate, but I just can't help it at Triple George, it's too darn good.    First off, parking is limited as it usually is downtown, usually it hasn't been an issue for us though since we just always manage to find a spot or two open at lunchtime.  Once you go inside, there's a certain elegance to the place that gives you the feeling of being a big shot.  I love the tables in closed off sections to the side that make you feel like the part of the restaurant is reserved for you, it only contributes to making my head bigger.    Second, the one thing that must absolutely be commended about Triple George is the service.  I love, LOVE, the service here.  Everybody from the hostess to the bus boys, to the waiters are incredibly professional and friendly.  No matter how busy the place seems it always feels like I am their number one priority.  They are more than ready to accommodate any request or answer any question I might have and always with a genuine positive attitude.    Finally and of course most importantly, the food.  The first time I came here I ordered meat loaf wrapped in bacon.  So that gives you the idea of the heartiness of the food that you'll find here.  It was juicy and delicious just as you would expect too.  I've also had the steak sandwich and while I wasn't as big a fan of the combo (I was too lazy to cut off the fat on the steak when it's already in a sandwich), I really did enjoy the chipotle mayo that came with it and again was more than satisfied especially when it actually came medium-rare like I ordered.    So in short, it's definitely good spot to stop by for lunch if you're downtown with surprisingly affordable options as well.  One day I'll have to stop by for dinner and see if I feel any different about the place, but I doubt it.",

    "text": "Seriously, I am stunned at why there are so many good reviews about this place. I'll start by saying that I would normally give a place a second try if it wasn't the best experience.. as there re many factors as to what can go wrong on any night of service.. but this was so far less than mediocre that I don't have any desire to go back.   From the start when my group of 4 walked in at 8pm, the bar was packed, but the booths were nearly empty as we took a stroll to look around. We did not get seated right away, but we were early.   The server didn't approach our table for nearly 10 minutes after we sat, and was in the vicinity at least 4 times... Finally,  she arrived and after ordering 3 martinis, that all came in completely different fashion than ordered.. and taking 15 minutes to get that sorted out.. it was at least 25 minutes before the server returned again. She was a mess.. and it didn't get better.   I had the wedge salad which was just fine, and my friends all had the Soup of the day - Jambalaya... which isn't soup.. and actually was 'gumbo' by my account.. and was actually very good. A friend had a caesar that he said tasted stale. It tasted overly fishy to me and unbalanced. (We had it taken away which is how he ended up with the gumbo, jambalaya, soup thing)  For the main course we ordered 3 steaks and a seafood pasta dish. The  steaks were very poor quality. I mean the ribeye was $32 .. and while that isn't the most expensive price for a steak of that sort, its a pretty hefty price tag for a garbage piece of meat.  It was ALL fat.. not marbled evenly and not very good grain to the meat at all.. just trash. I literally had 3 bites. Were it not for the martini and the 2 glasses of wine, I may have cared more.. but I was sharing with my friend and she switched with me for the seafood pasta.   Every, single scallop.. we counted 6 .. was sandy.. which to my knowledge means unwashed or from a can.. and unwashed. The sauce was meant to be some form of scampi I thought, but it was watery and thin and just not that good. Any of these complaints were not registered because the server never came back to check on us.  Ok, longest story short.. the server didn't return to the table until the check was dropped. The bussers basically took care of us until that point. Not only was the caesar salad on the check, but she added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Is this standard practice for sub par service and food? She was no where to be found, and my companions decided to leave it since we  would not be returning. '  I would not consider going to this place ever again unless something drastic happened, like it changed ownership. Honestly it was bad.",

    "text": "First the decor and vibe of this place is really cool. Great for nice dinner dates or even grabbing a bite with the boys. I really really wanted the food to be awesome.... It's not. It's not the worst I've ever had, but it's not great.  I stated with the Shrimp Cocktail which at $13.00 is a deal w/6 jumbo shrimp. On the strip this would be a $18-$20 app. Then I had the porcini crust ribeye med-rare at $41-$42 which was very mediocre. First the steak was more medium than med rare. There was no real crust. It tastes more like a rub with was brushed on at the end.  My server at the bar seemed a bit overwhelmed and was very short and choppy til the end of service.  Plus the food took just way too long to come out. Kitchen was killing me! We waited over an hr for our entree. I know it takes time to cook but that's ridic! Plus chef please put more effort to the veg portion to the meal. The 1980's are screaming for it back. The consolation to this review are the prices which are pretty decent for the style of restaurant they're trying pull off. If you go here don't get fancy. Order simple food and you'll be less vexed than I.",

    "text": "I work at The Mob Museum across the street, and make it to Triple George/Mob Bar twice a month for lunch.  I have frequented it in the twenties of times since I began working downtown.  That being said, a lot of the positive part of this rating is due to the service.  At the bar, service is prompt and you are consistently asked if everything is good, and drinks are always full.  The staff are very friendly, and take care of their guests.  Most of their food is fantastic, and this is the first time for me it fell far short of the mark.  I ordered the pot pie on their favorites menu... I almost asked for it the last time there, but decided against it....  I was really craving something hearty with carbs...  When it arrived, it came in a large bowl.  It is a HUGE portion!  Bonus for a $14.00 pot pie, for sure!  However, it was a bowl of chicken, chunks of potato, carrots, peas, onions and mushrooms in a soupy wine sauce... with a circular wafer of bread put on top.  It's not baked, nothing but this wafer of bread, and NO SEASONING.  I don't know how you would put on the menu that this is meant to mimic a pot pie, but that it wasn't one really.  I was so disappointed I thought I should have bought one frozen and a bottle of wine instead, and felt I would have had better results.  I will continue to go back for the things I enjoy, and know will come out right... but the other star and a half were lost today big time!  Thank you O.B. for making the remainder of the experience enjoyable.  P.S.  Our staff enjoy The Reuben, their soup and salad combo, and the pot roast!",

    "text": "I love this place. The last two times my husband and I were in Vegas, we stayed in the Downtown area. A good friend working on the strip recommended this restaurant. A block away from the Fremont Street Experience, you get away from the crowds to enjoy great food, atmosphere and fun.   The first time we went in August, the managers noticed we were new and introduced themselves. I was under the impression the restaurant itself was new as this is a tactic you see when new places open. Not the case here. Triple George has been around awhile and the managers always try to notice who walks in the door!   As self-proclaimed fanatics and my own twenty plus years in the biz, we love sitting near the kitchen to get the feel of the place, see the flow, enjoy the way the restaurant and staff make the flow happen for all the guests. I was certainly NOT disappointed. From our vantage point, we could see into the kitchen, around the large bar/ lounger area and into the dining area. We were treated to an entire evening of attentive service, excellent cocktails, fabulous food, near perfect timing, and the joy of watching truly seasoned staff in their element of harmony & flow through out.   We started off the evening with martinis - shaken to the point of the ice chips floating on top and made to our specs - barely a hint of vermouth and for me the slightest bit dirty. Not being a huge martini drinker, this was very good and very well done. We chose the goat cheese/ marinara appetizer. This was very tasty and the accompanied bread was toasted nicely. The only complaint on this I would have is it is really too big for just two people. The goat cheese was warmed just enough to spread onto the bread. We could have had this as our dinner. Each of us had salads. Being a bay area organics snob, I am always leery of the freshness of produce in other parts of the country. Here I was not disappointed. Each salad - iceberg wedge and Cesar, were fresh and crisp, definitely not day old produce here! Bacon bits on the iceberg wedge were not processed but made in house as was the blue cheese dressing - not heavy creamy, but complimented the blue cheese in the dressing. The dressing for the cesar was also fresh made in house - not overly salty as I find many to be.   The main dishes were great - rack of lamb and the special of the evening. I cannot remember the exact name of the special from back in August. If I do I will certainly update. The temperature on the rack of lamb was perfect - medium rare. The cut was definitely high quality as the flavor was excellent with no gamieness to it at all. The accompanying potato and vegetables were very tasty and not over seasoned at all. The special of the evening was a stew of three meats - lamb shank, beef, and pork. The stew was a coq au vin style with onions, carrots, potatoes and mushrooms in a dark wine sauce/ stew. The meats fell off the bones and were so tender and delicious! Again, huge portions of food but very tasty.  I will always make it a point to go to this place when we are in Vegas!",

Mom ordered the Crab Louie salad which she loved; big chunks of crab, homemade dressing etc.  I ordered the chopped salad which had chunks of avocado and fresh tomatoes - delicious!  The service was so good I gave the waiter a 22% tip and wrote excellent service on the receipt.  Also - this is a great place to take clients when you want them to sign your contract!  Here are my tips to having a positive dining experience:  1) I always ask the wait staff to tell me their favorite menu items or the signature items of the restaurant.  If they don't know or don't eat at the restaurant, I never go back. 2) If the service is bad, I let the manager know so they can do something to fix it. 3) If the service is truly awful, I ask for a new waiter. 4) I always tip well - most waiters really do care and they deserve to be compensated.  I usually tip 15% for mediocre service and one time the service was so bad I gave the tip directly to the bus boy.",

Our waiter was indifferent, did not bother to explain the dinner specials, and appeared generally hostile. Second time around, our waitress Denise was attentive, took time to explain the specials, made cocktail suggestions, and was very friendly. The food here is hit and miss; the salad greens were wilted and littered with sad looking carrots that appeared to have been munched and spat out by a cow with bad teeth. The calamari was way overcooked, chewy. Really, there's no need to fry calamari until it's dark brown. The lamb was delicious, steaks properly cooked, chicken was juicy, oysters were sweet, and the drinks were yummy. Highly recommended, just stay away from the salads and calamari.",

In the sea of steakhouses in Las Vegas, I can't afford many of them!  Triple George Grill is a classy, tasty, and fantastic restaurant that won't break your bank.  It is the perfect place to take visiting relatives, a date, or even a casual dinner with the spouse.  It's also a great place for lunch.  They have some of their best entrees from the dinner menu priced at only $10 for lunch.  Some recommendations: - The petite New York steak (comes with a starch and delicious, buttery veggies) is only $17! - The petrel sole is a great fish entree - Bacon wrapped meatloaf - Cioppino (one of the pricier entrees at $24, but it's very yummy)  But the best thing about this restaurant is...the BREAD.  You get a steaming fresh sourdough loaf right to your table.  It is hot, soft, tangy, and will be in your belly in no time!",

We decided to eat at Triple George Grill in downtown Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday since they have a Vegan menu. We made reservations and were seated promptly and immediately noticed the noise level. It was 6:30pm on a Saturday night and the noise level was above average. The restaurant is very classy looking with a huge bar in the middle. Everything is made out of dark wood: the bar, the booths, the floors- which makes a normal level of noise seem louder.   There are 5 items on the Vegan menu: Grilled vegetable platter, Gardein chicken marsala, Gardein chicken bruschetta, Ravioli (in a spicy sauce) and the Vegetable Vegan burger. I had the ravioli, my boyfriend had the vegetable burger and the others in our party ordered from the regular menu. Everyone was happy with their food. The ravioli was filled with a tofu ricotta, covered in a spicy tomato sauce with lots of vegetables. The vegetable burger was good, but I think the white truffle oil fries were the best part of the dish.   We would definitely go back, just not for a special occasion.",

I never go to Vegas with out stopping here at least once and I always leave on cloud nine. This trip was the special of the day Buffalo Rib Eye with blue cheese. We split that with Calamari to start followed by a chopped salad. Accompanied by a bottle of Troublemaker and followed by a chocolate death of some sort, pure food orgasm....  Did I mention I love this place and just writing this is making my mouth water.  Get there late or make a reservation to get a nice booth but make sure to visit the bar first as they have the best, friendliest bartenders in vegas. The basil cucumber martini was amazing and a great price during happy hour.  One last note if you can only go here once you absolutely, positively, with out doubt, no question about it must have the Cioppino. Yes its that good and just typing about it has made me so hungry I must go eat now...",

It is a mere block or two off of Fremont and the kind of neighborhood bistro you'd find in any great city. I had the NY strip and my son ordered the black and blue special (a rib eye with a blue cheese crust). They could probably get away with a little less blue cheese - but that was the only minus for our meal. Our server Marti was fantastic and the assistant servers were equally attentive.   My steak was huge and cooked to perfection (medium with a warm red center). The Caesar is a creamy house made dressing and extremely well prepared. Your entree comes with a bountiful side of steamed vegetables and a starch - depending on the entree. The prices are below the other downtown or strip steak places but the atmosphere and food quality is equal to the high end restaurants and you're not paying ala carte for your side dishes. The salad was not included, however. So, in terms of value and food quality this place cannot be beat. Apparently it's a hot ticket at lunch time when the city's movers and shakers eat during the week. I'm not surprised.",

Take their suggestions. The servers know what you want. Just ask! Their happy hour is fantastic too! It gets very busy during happy hour so make sure you get good seats at the bar.

Immediately after tasting this steak I knew it needed some type of sauce or something. This guy comes back with this gravy like sauce which was also very cold and not a good steak topper. The veggies weren't even fully cooked. This place was an absolute joke of a 4 star steakhouse. Hopefully with a few more reviews like mine and the few recently this leaves rating will go down!

Gotta say that this time around, on a Saturday night, the service was a little spotty. We sat at the bar as usual and interacted with three different servers before the drinks were even delivered (one of which was wrong). Also, our end of the bar was empty so we requested that the TV channel be switched to a game other than that which was being shown. Our request was conveyed to the manager who listened and then rejoined the crowd of wait staff congregated outside the window to the kitchen. (No channel change) In any case the food, when it arrived, as usual was top notch and servers were all pleasant. Comparatively speaking, Triple George offers good value for Vegas and, despite the hassle of dealing with downtown parking, should definitely be on your list if your in the Fremont street area. We're locals so we have a relatively good handle on the downtown dining scene and Saturday's experience was unusual so we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've known about Triple George Grill since 2005, it came highly recommended by my friend Cinnamon Steen Fahey who used to be a showgirl back in the Rat Pack days (she performed with Sammy Davis Jr in the 70's and Isaac \"shut yo mouth\" Hayes as well as numerous shows around the valley) so you know she KNOWS Vegas....  Well, fast forward almost 10 years later and we finally made it here..go figure, I even lived Downtown for a year and never made it. WHAT was I thinking?!? We definitely missed out not coming here earlier.  So we decided to have a staycation for the mister's birthday- got a room at the Downtown Grand and made dinner reservations at Triple George. I had done months of research on steakhouses all over Vegas..yeah we could have gone to one of the fancier ones on the strip but I'm not that type of person- I would rather support local as much as I can.  And the Downtown area has changed so much that the area around Triple George is just so much fun now.  Walking in, I felt like I was back at Chic's Place in San Francisco.  Well, I found out from our waiter that Triple George's owner created it to be exactly like Tadich Grill in SF!  Our waiter was great, we talked about SF and about Maui (where he is from)- service was top notch from the hostess down to the busboy.  We started with the baked goat cheese marinara appetizer, it came with lots of crostini and could easily feed 4 people.  Since we wanted to save room for our entrees, we had to stop ourselves from gorging on warm cheese and bread!  The mister ordered the porcini crusted ribeye and I had the petrale sole, both were delicious but I LOVED the ribeye...it was done a perfect medium rare and was like \"buttah\"!.  I loved it so much that I ate my fish and almost half of the mister's ribeye!  The veggies that came with our entrees were nothing to rave about, but the star of the dinner was for sure the steak.  We finished off dinner with a complimentary chocolate cake with a birthday candle and a Irish coffee.  Overall, an outstanding evening!",

Definetly lick a little salt off the rim before you sip to get the full expierence. The pot roast is fantastic. Definitely try the chocolate endulgence.

    "text": "This review is based on two visits to Triple George Grill.  Overall, I found this restaurant/bar haunt on the edge of downtown to be an excellent provider of comfort food.  But there were ups and downs.  The first occasion followed an enjoyable Las Vegas Yelp Book Club meeting, as I dined with a few fellow Yelpers, including our Community Manager, Misti Y.  We began with very good warm sourdough bread, followed by a nice complimentary relish tray which contained green and black olives, hot red and green peppers, gerkins, and carrot sticks.  On the second occasion I had to ask for a relish tray, but it then quickly arrived. Slightly peppery Calamari was very good dipped in either a mild Marinara Sauce or an excellent Lemon Butter Sauce that was presented on request without extra charge.  Excellent baked French Onion Soup was both hot and cheesy.  The Cheese was Swiss, and the crouton bread that broke down quickly in the hot broth.  Only a little patience is required to allow the crouton time to melt.  On the first visit, soup was followed by a very good Caesar Salad with Parmesan splinters and tasty clusters of toasted Romano Cheese.  On the second, an equally fine George's Chopped Salad was served.  This dish featured Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, green onion, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, and ample avocado chunks all tossed in a flavorful Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.  Both entrees I ordered were delicious.  One was Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, served with excellent Brown Gravy, mushrooms, green beans, carrots, and onions.  To my surprise, I liked this dish even better than I did the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy I had recently enjoyed at Postrio, and later praised.  On the second outing, I was presented with a gigantic bowl topped by a thin sheet of crust beneath which lay the other ingredients of an excellent Chicken Pot Pie.  The crust and filling were not connected, but all it took to do so was to break the crust into pieces with a large spoon provided.  Inside the bowl were numerous chunks of white chicken meat, peas, carrots, pearl onions, tender potato chunks, and pieces of Button Mushrooms, all merged with a garlicky Cream Sauce that tasted good but was too peppery to me.  The crust was buttery and no different than a very good doughy top clinging to a traditionally prepared Chicken Pot Pie.  The result was successful, just like the independent-component and memorable Lobster Pot Pie I enjoyed at Michael Mina's Stonehill Tavern inside the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point, California.  Unfortunately, Diane ordered Chicken Parmesan with specially requested Alfredo Sauce, which was graciously supplied.  But, while the portion of Chicken Parmesan and linguini was immense, the sauce was really thin and insipid.  Hopefully, this was but an infrequent aberration.  An excellent homemade and gigantic Chocolate Chip Cookie covered by a scoop of ordered Vanilla Ice Cream was the highlight of the second meal, even better than B.J.'s Pizookie, which I also happen to like.  Service on both occasions was friendly and very attentive.  It needed to be, because on the initial encounter, clumsy me overturned my straw-topped glass and spilled the entire contents of an almost fully filled Iced Tea right onto the lap of my Yelp friend Mamie P.  She brushed off this accident very well but I knew that it must have felt like an icy-cold assault, and felt badly about it.  When notified, the restaurant staff immediately charged into action, swiftly cleaning up the mess and providing new napkins, Iced Tea, and a new bread loaf, which also took a light hit from flying brown liquid drops.    The restaurant has a dark woodsy look, and reminded me of San Francisco's Tadich Grill where I liked to dine when I had been able to scrounge up enough money to do so while attending law school in the city.  Papers littered the floor of the men's restroom on one visit to Triple George, but after I alerted my server about this, within one hour the messy restroom had been cleaned up.  I greatly enjoyed both dinners, and intend to return soon to try the Country Fried Steak.  4-1/2 stars!",

    "text": "Triple George grill is an outstanding restaurant. The only thing one needs to know is that meals should be shared between two people. The portion sizes are humungous! If you prefer to order your own entree, one would recommend ordering no appetizer and no dessert. The chicken pot pie was incredible. It was simply delicious. My friend had the chicken Parmesan and swore it was one of the best he ever had. I would also have to say that three people could feed on the chicken pot pie all at once and be satisfied. What makes it even more outstanding is the fact that the price that comes with the chicken pot pie is not one you would expect for a restaurant of such a high caliber. The prices are very low and the food is a very high-quality. I would definitely consider sharing entrees. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant often. Truly excellent.",

Drinks were brought promptly and the evening specials were quickly explained to us by Monique, our server. Quite competent, as she returned often throughout the meal to check on us.       3 of us had the Mahi special - 1 blackened and 2, on special request, charbroiled. Rave reviews for all three dinners. I was not very hungry, so opted for Caprese salad and the soup of the day - white bean with ham chunks. Kudos to both.       Sourdough bread was indeed sour - as it should be! Butter with oil and herbs was a little unusual, but not too bad (none left after the bread was devoured!)      Our only complaint was when the bill arrived, a flyer for the Monday special (50% off a bottle of wine) was tucked in with the bill - too late for us unfortunately! Monique apologized profusely, and offered additional glasses \"gratis\" after telling us she never worked on Mondays and was not aware of the offer.       If not for that major mistake, 5 stars would have been awarded. But we would definitely return on our next trip into Las Vegas - and on a Monday night!!",

I will have to say that it was the finest meal that either of us have ever had that neither of us had prepared. That may seem a little conceited, but most of the time meals out come up a little short. We usually go home thinking that we could have made just as good, or better at home for a lot less coin.  Not so with the meal we were starved tonight!  Bravo Triple George!  My lamb chops were done to perfection and the accompanying sauce and veggies completed the whole experience.   The wife had the petite filet and commented that it was the first time in many dining experiences that she completely cleared her plate.  I am sorry that I did not catch the name of the young lady that so graciously and professionally presented our meal, but she seemed to be one among many professionals representing this establishment admirably.   Once again, Bravo Triple George!!",

They serve big loaves of bread and butter before the meal and I did not try the bread but it smelled good. I asked for veg butter and they didn't think they had any. No worries I'm not a bread fan.  Hubby got the vegan ravioli which when I tried it was super good. Sauce was perfect.  I decided on the gardien \"chicken\" marsala. It was super duper yummy. The sauce on it was plentiful and the portions here...let me tell you they are huge. Lots of quick steamed crunchy veggies. Tons of rice (it was brown rice) and a large cutlet.  I'm really impressed and glad to have this little place Downtown! We are going back soon and I want to checkout a HH menu and see what is to offer.

Wha??  A-The food was so delicious that there wasn't a lick left on any plate! That tells you something. We had buttermilk fried chicken, shrimp scampi, fish n chips, and charbroiled salmon.  B-The iced tea--they serve it with cubes made of frozen tea! I love this idea because as the ice melts, your tea doesn't get watery--it gets tea-y! lol All staff were splendid.

Good meat only needs a little salt and pepper.  My dinner experience was a little better on the food end but the service was poor.  It was late but if you're gonna serve late I expect the same quality service as if it were the dinner rush.  Our server was much more interested in doing her side work and gossiping with other staffers than to pour me another beer or simply make sure we were doing ok.  This place is trying to be the cool spot downtown.  They may want to re-focus their staff and let them know there are plenty of energetic service industry people looking for work in vegas.",

And he goes \"just to be clear, its not free, we would have to charge you for it, but i wanted to see if you wanted it before i dumped it out.\" Um...if you are planning to dump it out anyway, why not just let us have it??? Weirdly enough, two other friends of mine said that exact same thing happened to them at this restaurant. I won't be eating here again. The food was just eh, but I can't overlook the \"either you pay for it or we dispose of it\" bad customer service. So so tacky.",

He recommended this restaurant, which is a block away from the Fremont Street Experience (see my review of that as well). The steaks were huge but even so, it was a little pricey for being off the strip. The service was average and the decor wasn't anything special and pretty plain (all deep brown wood which might appeal to some). I had the petite New York, which wasn't very petite and my husband had the ribeye, which he claimed was \"good for a ribeye,\" whatever that means. I usually douse my steak in A1 but it sat untouched throughout my meal. I left wishing we had tried a different steakhouse. Measly servings of wine as well, but you're still overcharged for a full glass. Other than that, nothing much to write home about for this one. Wouldn't go back if we came to Vegas again.",

    "text": "I went to the Triple George for a girls' night dinner. I was excited to try the spot as I had read great things, and I am always a fan of supporting downtown businesses. The best things that the Triple George have going for it are atmosphere and alcohol.   The atmosphere is dark and wooden, which works when you are in that mood. The walls feature lots of pics of vintage Vegas, and I adore gazing at those. There is a main dining area, and then Sidebar, a separate bar/lounge that is connected to Triple George.  The bar service is great. The bartender was friendly, and I was super comfortable chilling at the bar waiting for my girlfriends to arrive.  Our server was also nice, but the food simply was not that good. I had the chicken pot pie, and it was very disappointing. It was closer to a soup with a crust on top than a pot pie. There were very few vegetables and chicken chunks, not hearty at all. The sauce was super thin; I find it hard to imagine they started with a roux. It was so thin. The crust was okay but not spectacular. Maybe they do lunch better, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.   Parking is not so bad if you don't mind valeting; it will just cost you a tip. It is just a pain to find the right place to turn onto 3rd street. I missed it once and had to go around the block. If you are staying downtown, then no worries, as 3rd street is an easy walk from anywhere.  I would definitely return to lounge at Sidebar and have a few cocktails, but unless I simply ordered the worst thing on the menu, I have definitely had better American fare.",

I read about Triple George on yelp and how beautiful it was. Well, it is but they sat us in the bar where it was loud and no atmosphere. The hostess made a face when I asked if there was a better table. While we were waiting for our dinner I peeked in the main dining room and it was beautiful. The manager came by and asked how we are doing. I asked him why we can't sit in the dining room because it was my bday and I wanted it to be a special evening. He said we only serve large parties in there  on Sunday nights. If it was my business I would make this elderly couple happy and give them a damn table in the dining room. Oh well, next night we went to Second Street Grille and sat in their beautiful dining room. We live in Henderson and visit downtown often but it won't be Triple George.",

Soultry female singer, great martinis, and I discovered the tomolive in their signature martini.  Fast forward to a couple of months, our most recent trip. No singer, crowded and the smell of seafood (albeit, it is a seafood restaurant). When asked what kind of olives were in their martinis (because we didn't know what they were for months!) no one knew what we were talking about. Then, once researching their drink menu to find that those yummy round pieces of goodness were tomolives, a bar tender told us that they haven't had those the three years he has worked there. Then, when ordering the martini, which on the menu specifically said there were tomolives, a different bar tender told us they were out of them. If they haven't had them in \"three years\", although we did have them a couple months prior, and if they aren't going to have them, why leave it on the menu to tempt those who are seeking. That was truly the reason we went back to the bar to order their pricey signature drink. It was not the same and my martini, ordered extra dirty, was not. Maybe if I tried the restaurant side, I may like the food and update my review, but the bar was disappointing and the menu looks expensive. We'll see.",

Not warm, not luke-warm, not room temperature. Cold, as if it had been left out under the air conditioning vent. I informed the waiter, who at first attempted to place the cause on the fact that I ordered it medium rare. Sorry, I have eaten at MANY great steak restaurants, and never have I been served a cold steak \"because it was medium rare.\" He took it back for them to flash it. He returned, and it was warmer. However, because there was a sauce on the steak, the sauce was now seared into the meat, it was no longer a sauce, but dried and cooked into the meat. Nothing was offered to compensate for the horrid food I was served, and I left unhappy. I do not recommend for any reason.",

Attention locals:  Brighten your jury duty day with a lunch at the Triple George.  There is enough time to walk here from the courthouse, have lunch, and return during your one hour lunch.  The decor is old style with dark wood and a long bar area with plenty of seating surrounded by booths.  There were a handful of people having lunch when I arrived.  The bartender was quick to offer drinks and take my order.  I got the steak sandwich.  When it came out I was a little surprised, but to be fair it is True to the menu.  It was a new york steak (very well cooked) unsliced on a bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, and some sort of garlic sauce.  Once I got over the bit of shock, it was really good.  They have a section of the menu that is all under $10 if you want to grab a cheap, quick bite to eat in the fremont street area.",

    "text": "In town for the Summer Furniture Market and wanted to stay close to our hotel (Downtown Grand...great hotel btw for another review). They said if you wanted a good steak and salad with a walk up bar  if you were alone or in a small group, this was the place. They've got just a side bar area where younger folks can order a shot, several dining sections with dim lights for a classy environment for a group and then a great big bar with open seating where you can eat, have a drink and no reservation needed. Melanie was great, the food was outstanding and the price was very reasonable. All the  furniture retailers in town  staying at the Downtown Grand, at the Gold Nugget or any hotel within 3 blocks should make the Triple George a group outing while in town. If you want a great retail furniture website, everybody knows to see the MicroD guys, and if you want a great steak dinner in old Vegas, you gotta go to the Triple George.",

Fish of the day was swordfish and was perfect, although . We had the apple glazed pork which was delicious at medium although I suggest at medium rare. Service from Cameron was awesome.

For starters parking isn't always the most convenient downtown so park at The Downtown Grand Casino & Hotel and they'll validate your ticket for free. It's a short walk over...  The food was great except for the lousy Caesar salad that had a watery dressing and was on the bland side. The NY steak was extra juicy and my chicken was delicious with great mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked veggies on the side. If you enjoy ice tea they have one of the best ones around with ice tea ice cubes in it and I must have had at least 3 refills (complimentary) it was so good.   Service was great and it's a beautiful restaurant that feels like something out of old Hollywood. Dark woods, mood lighting, large bar where you can also eat and very cozy, nearly private booths that are very old school.",

From the time the bread hits the table with the butter , it's on !   Don't let downtown stop you from coming here, it's really easy to park. And free, if you dine at the grill.

In the time that we had drinks, appetizers, and dinner, the wait staff checked in on us almost 20 times.  We started with drinks and an calamari appetizer. Then we moved on to dinner for 2, I had pot roast and Marcia had the hanger steak. I don't think that I have ordered pot roast in a restaurant before, but after reading all the tips for the pot roast, I decided to try it, and it was amazing. I would strongly recommend trying the pot roast. The hanger steak was good. Its is not often that when you order medium rare, that you actually get medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly.   Our both was almost like a room of its own, and is great for an intimate dinner for 2, or for a group of 4.  The total bill for 2 of us was $74, and worth every penny. There was no disappointment here, next time I am in Vegas in the Fremont district I will certainly return to the Triple George Grill.  Remember... try the pot roast.",

All of it was so good and the steaks were cooked exactly how they were ordered.   The ambiance was open yet shockingly quiet with a True steakhouse feel. Some areas even had more private seating with TV's in the booth which I thought was a cool touch. One thing about the menu that confused us is that we were lead to believe that the entree's didn't come with anything. They in fact came with a side of veggies and mashed potatoes but none of us saw that indicated on the menu.  We also all had a slew of cocktails ranging from wine, beer, and mixed drinks.

The husband had a steak and I ate their fish special for the evening. Service and food were excellent!",

    "text": "I've been to Triple George a few times, but on this particular night, we were heading to the Smith Center to see the play, \"The Waitress.\"  The restaurant had a cute, play-inspired, themed special menu for the night.    The service wasn't as great as it normally is, but they started getting busy as we were wrapping up our dinner, so perhaps that had something to do with it.  That's the only reason for a 4 star review over a 5 star review.  I think at the prices for this restaurant the service should be top notch.    The food was awesome.  We had tasty crab cakes, mouth watering fried chicken and tender Marsala chicken.  I did try one of the special cherry pie inspired cocktails and it was delicious.    Parking is always an issue.  There is limited, free, on-street parking if you are lucky enough to snag a spot.  If not, my recommendation is to park at the Grand in their garage, but there is a small fee.",

I found myself in this state of mind and arrived at Triple George with my buddy Omar (from Seattle).  We sat outside on a beautiful spring evening and started to attack the menu with some appetizers.  The fresh oysters were remarkably fresh: one almost thought that one was Oceanside. The shrimp cocktail was delicious especially the sauce that accompanied it.  And the mushrooms au poivre left you longing for more.  Now to the main course.  The chicken pot pie was huge but also with huge flavors. My buddy didn't think he could finish it, but finish he did. It was that good.  I opted for a Caesar Salad with a cup of bisque. A superb combo.  All this topped off with Davidoffs slowly releasing the smoke in a beautiful evening breeze.  Last but not the least: superb   UPDATE: July 14, 2018 Triple George delivers. This was my second visit in 2 months. And I was as pleased as the first time around. A wonderful surf and turf dinner.   UPDATED: November 26, 2018 On a couple of previous occasions I have extolled the efforts of the businesses in downtown Las Vegas to reinvigorate and reenergize the downtown area. I am impressed by the quality of the restaurants and the entertainment options.  Triple George is a shining example of this. In the last year or so I have dined here at least three or four times and have been impressed by the consistency of the quality put out by the kitchen. Yesterday my son and I had lobster tail, crab legs and a 40 ounce porterhouse for two.  Magnificent.   Our server, Monique, was excellent.  No complaints.  Keep it up guys!",

I figured typically bar food, but i was so wrong.  Further in the back area is quite an enjoyable fine dining experience. The service was impeccable, and the food... so unexpected. We shared a steak and chicken pot pie. Now, I know it doesnt sound gourmet, but the quality is there. Delicious and mouthwatering even the pot pie. I should have saved room for dessert, but now I have something to look forward to. Forewarned, it is pricey and it can be a special type dining experience, but it was an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "I've seen this name plastered at different foodie events across town every now and again so when my friend told me we were going here, I was quite excited.  This place is old school looking with a very large, albeit kind of cramped bar space, closed in booths, and a side dining room.    We sat down and took a look at the menu and so many things looked good and the prices were fairly reasonable, especially if you didn't get one of the top tier steaks!  My party settled on three cocktails: a Manhattan, a sidecar, and an old fashioned, all of which were strong and were enjoyed.  When it comes to food we got the spinach and artichoke dip, Caesar salad, cream of chicken and rice soup, drunken hanger steak, meatloaf, and their burger.  None of the food was bad but some could have been a bit better.  I was told the burger and hanger steak were both good although when I tried the steak, I found it to be really sweet.  The dip was just alright and if I go back I would not order it again.  The Caesar salad was good but was lacking a bit of flavor.  The soup was delicious and I could've eaten a trough of it.  I got the meatloaf and at first I thought it was a pretty small portion but after eating it, I became really quite full.  It was dense lol.  It came with a brown gravy, was wrapped in bacon, and came with mashed potatoes, brocolinni, and carrots.  Everything was really good but it definitely needed more gravy as one of my pieces was a bit dry.    Overall this was a very good meal and I will gladly go back again.  The wait staff was very nice but I think could use a bit more training.  One of our meals was almost spilled on my friend's lap and our main waiter couldn't remember what any of us got on several occasions and there was only three of us.  That being said, I can't wait to go back and try their other options!",

Water was refilled quickly, sodas were replaced by second glasses, dishes were also cleared quickly.  Fried calamari appetizer was typical, served with red and white sauces. Didn't use them so can't comment further. Crab cake was a single appetizer about the size of a hockey puck. Mostly crab meat and some binder. Tasted fine.  Friends had diferent dishes. Myles had the chicken pot pie. We had shared that and a pastrami reuben the night before at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian. Myles said it was good but preferred the one at the GLC. He made everyone taste it, and everyone liked it. But I agree with Myles. If you've never been to GLC, it is the Venetian's coffee shop, but it is run by the same people who run the Cheesecake Factory, so the food is really good. Since chicken pot pies are being compared, I think the one at the Claim Jumper in the Golden Nugget is better than these two.  Paul had the filet. No complaints from him. Greg had the blackened ahi. No complaints from him either. As far as my NY Strip Steak was concerned, it was good, but I prefer the taste of the steak at the Redwood Room in The Cal, or at the Second Street Grill in the Fremont.  Overall, a solid restaurant. Great service, very good food. Recommended.",

    "text": "My server's name was Brenda.  She was quite attentive the entire time and thoroughly made sure I enjoyed my time there.  She never rushed me and was very patient while I was nibbling my cheese plate.  She anticipated my needs by offering fresh-ground pepper, appropriate utensils, etc.  Five stars for the service.  Food gets approximately 3.75 stars.  I ordered a cheese plate, citrus salad, pork chop, and creamed corn.  The cheese plate had a nice selection of hard and soft cheeses.  The highlight was the cheese ball with rolled walnuts.  It also came with a strawberry, bagel chips, and a mandarin orange marmalade.  This was easily five stars. The pork chop came with seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes.  The \"seasonal veggies\" were broccolini and baby carrots.  The chop is bone-in (see picture) and the apple compote that came with it was perfect.  No complaints with this either.    The other two options were very mediocre in comparison.  It may not be a fair comparison, but I ate lunch at Lawry's earlier in the day, where I had real creamed corn.  The dish here tasted no better than the stuff you get out of a can and by appearance, it very well may have been.  This was definitely not worth the $6 I paid for it.  The salad build itself was very nice--fresh spinach leaves, cranberries, candied walnuts, goat cheese.  All of this was fine.  The dressing was decidedly less so.  Nothing stood out in the dressing and it taste like someone merely combined some lemon and lime juice and added some oil.  No herbs or other seasonings were detectable.    Overall, however, it was a very good experience.  Look forward to going back.",

    "text": "We ate here three times while in Downtown Las Vegas. Whatever works, right?  First time the service was a little slow, but it picked up. Here's the rundown:  #1 experience: I ordered the Brussels and chicken. The server asked me if I wanted vegan chicken. We all laughed because \"vegan chicken\" is such an oxymoron. I told him to bring on the real stuff and out came an EXTREMELY generous portion of chicken and Brussels sprouts. I couldn't finish it all. I had been warned the Brussels may be a little crispy (some people apparently complain), but I thought they could have been even crispier. I like them a bit charred.   #2 experience: Co-worker had just landed and the rest of us had already eaten, so we accompanied her so she could eat. She loved her dish (fried chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies) and I had a glass of wine with some passion fruit mousse. The wine was a C (not the restaurant's fault) and the mousse was really good.  #3 experience: Lunch again. This time I had the chopped salad with chicken. Again, a huge portion. It was very good and really liked the balsamic. Colleague and I split a creme brulee - very good.  My favorite is their bread and the butter/olive oil they serve with it.  Would definitely recommend and if you need a place for a business lunch, this is a great choice.",

    "text": "Trying something that's not one of your usual go-to's at a restaurant is akin to agreeing to go on a blind date.  As a precursor to the date (ordering), your friend (the menu) tries to play up your potential mate (the dish) in the best light possible.  You'll hear things that sound too good to be True, like you're about to meet someone (eat something) who's a doctor during the week and saves dolphins on the weekend or a Victoria's Secret model who's looking for that special someone to blow her trust fund on (crab-stuffed shrimp).  The supporting highlights continue to roll in, things such as an impeccable fashion sense (chef's fresh vegetable selection) or their amazing sense of humor (lemon butter sauce).  After committing to the date (the dish), there's still that twinge of buyer's remorse as you question whether deviating from the norm was the right decision (the shrimp) or if you should have just relegated yourself to your usual Friday night agenda -- couch-ridden, half-watching some horrible movie on USA and wondering whether the bottle of Charles Shaw or the tub of Haagen Dazs will reveal a view of its bottom first (the petite filet).  But, a glimmer of hope presents itself.  In the time leading up to your date (entree) you happen to meet one or two other folks that run in the same circle of friends (the bread, a Ketel One martini) and they seem nearly perfect so you're feeling a lot better about the upcoming fate facing your heart (stomach).  The wait also allows time to conjure up images of your dolphin-riding, lingerie model fantasy date (jumbo sauteed prawns overstuffed with fresh, lump crab meat).  Finally, the day (meal) arrives.  Your date (entree) shows up and...total dud (total dud).  The doctor is a nurse's assistant who saves dolphins by not eating tuna; and the model? she's helping introduce VS's new line of Spanx muumuu undergarments (5 large shrimp that may or may not have had some crab hidden within the heavy breading atop a pool of white cream).  You try your best to find the silver lining, like the security of being with someone that will be able to change out your bedpan as your life nears its expiration date or being able to [honestly] say that you're dating a model (the vegetables were good), but disappointment still lingers heavily at the table.  I'm not one of those Yelpers who typically bemoans not having the ability to leave half star reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception.  It was better than A-OK, but not quite a Yay! 3.5 for great service, drinks and bread/butter.   ---  Cliff Notes Version:  One star for each George.  Looking forward to attending the reopening of Quintuple George.",

It wasnt good especially for the price.   The Fish and Chips were not fully cooked when they came. The chicken parm was fine but I can make better at home. I didnt need to eat this out. Calamari was very good, fresh, hot and crispy. Wedge salad was decent, good blue cheese, nice fresh tomatoes, would have been nicer if they took off the first leaf of wilted lettuce (not a big deal). Mushroom pasta was good, Id order that again. But do note on the pasta sauce that it is a bit sweet and has sun dried tomatoes, not sure if the menue states this or not.   The service was slow, friendly but slow. We went on a Sunday night it shouldnt have been an issue.   I had to keep getting up to get fresh pepper from the pepper mill on the shelf above my table because the waiter didnt do it when salads or good came. That was kinda annoying for the type of restaurant.  With all the other great places to eat in Vegas, I wouldnt come back.",

    "text": "I had a great dinner with work colleagues and it was excellent. At first, we were seated outside and the temperature was rapidly stopping and instead of offering to move us inside, we had to wait and beg for a table. Once inside, things started to look up.   The drink menu was short yet comparable to other drinks in the area. I didn't take a peek at the wine list, but I'm sure it was just as lovely.  We ordered appetizers first: oysters on the half shell were just okay, kind of mediocre. The mignonette was weak. As was the cocktail sauce. Ketchup with a little horseradish in it. The calamari was good, but the rings were cut a little to big, and there were no tentacles (my favorite part), French onion soup was VERY rich and flavorful, but again... It was just okay. The chopped salad was gross. It was watery, weepy and looked like it had been sitting in a fridge for 3 days. The dressing is balsamic and a little too tart. The carpaccio was great but had wayyyy too much truffle oil on it and the lettuce greens. The best app we had: baked goat cheese. The grilled bread was kind of fantastic.   It took an extraordinary amount of time to get our entrees, but I was pleased with my buttermilk sage fried chicken. It had the same breading as the calamari and I couldn't taste any sage, but it was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes (listed as chef's recommended accompaniments) were a little dry and chunky. The sauteed vegetables were the best things in the plate.   Why 4 stars? The prices were reasonable (except for a $60 steak, good Lord!), the atmosphere was upscale and it's very convenient choice that's close to Fremont Street. Would I return? Maybe. The dishes are classic-chicken, steaks, pasta, seafood and there's something for everyone on the menu.",

    "text": "I'd say four or five stars for being a cool, off the beaten path, downtown location. It's directly next to Hogs & Heifers biker bar on 3rd street and it seems the only way to park on the one-way street is via motorcycle or valet service.  I met up with my man for his lunch break, he works downtown, and he surprised me by taking me to this hidden venue. I love the decor and the old school Las Vegas ambience inside. It's classy, but with an edge, and I was very excited to try it out.  Unfortunately the two stars is for service / food. We were seated in one of the big wooden booths, which is great for privacy, but also where we seemed to be forgotten about, being out of eyesight.  I ordered an iced tea (I know surprise surprise I didn't order alcohol, but it was only 1:00 and I still had to hit the gym with a friend at 5), and I had to ask for a lemon wedge four times before receiving one. Then I only got a refill after asking for one, when my glass had been empty for over ten minutes. I wasn't complaining at that point, we were busy reading and talking over Las Vegas Weekly, figuring out what to do that weekend.  On to the food: I ordered a club sandwich on marbled rye and added swiss cheese. The man ordered a caesar salad and a potato leek \"soup of the day\".  The caesar salad was small and wasn't too great, tasted like a generic grocery store brand dressing.  The sandwich was okay, pretty uninspiring, but then again I did order a club, so I didn't expect anything too fancy.  However, I really wanted dijon mustard, but the server didn't check on us or how the food tasted for another 15 minutes. By that time my boyfriend had finished all of his food while I only took a few bites, waiting for mustard. I finished almost all of the fries though. By the time I got my mustard and put it on the sandwich, the man had to go back to work, so I took the rest in a to-go box.   Needless to say: I thought the ambience and location was pretty cool, but the service and food was sub-par. I might return for just a martini though, based on some of the other reviews.",

They're oysters and crab cocktail are beyond wonderful. Wouldn't expect such high quality fresh seafood in Las Vegas. The fish and chips are also really good if you're looking for a fried entree. If shooting for a chicken dish I recommend the chicken saltimbocca but have tried all and they're all cooked wonderfully. Full of flavor and never dry. I don't eat red meat so unfortunately I can't speak of that part of the menu.",

    "text": "OK so I've eaten here a few different times and every time its been great. Tonight though i had them deliver dinner because they do offer delivery and was pretty disappointed. I got the brushetta, the pot roast and the chocolate cake for dessert (all for my wife and I to share). The brushetta bread was burnt, the actual brushetta was literally soaked with balsamic vinaigrette so it was pretty mushy and the pot roast looked like it might have been sitting around a while because when we got it the gravy had already cooled down and looked kind of like a jelly substance. Now I know that none of these problems would have happened had we gone in to eat at the restaurant, but I feel like we were taken advantage of because we were not sitting inside the restaurant and they knew that we would not be able to send the food back. For reference, I live about a block away from the restaurant so there's no way that it would've cooled down that much or for the brushetta to saturate in the vinaigrette. What they also fail to tell you over the phone when you order is that they already include gratuity so you don't get the choice on how much you get to give. Overall, definitely dissapointed in the food quality.",

    "text": "Good place for lunch.  The menu food is a bit pricey to me (what can I say, sometimes I can be cheap).  However, they have an excellent Ten Under $10 lunch menu.  I've had the Grilled Chicken Breast off that, which was excellent -- very moist and hit the spot when I was on the healthy wagon.    I also had a special of the day once, some type of turkey wrap, which was not as good. However, my friend tells me that in her former life as a waitress, special of the day usually translates to crap the restaurant is trying to get rid of.  So that may or may not have factored into that.  Although I haven't had it, my co-workers tell me the Reuben is also pretty good.   Another tip -- if there's more than two people in your party for lunch, I recommend making lunch reservations. The place gets really full during the lunch hour.  The last time I went with people from work, there wasn't a table available and we had to sit side by side at  the counter.  While that works for two people, it doesn't so much for five!   The food is consistently good and I think the decor/ambiance adds to the experience.",

The atmosphere is low-key, and semi-upscale but done with an old school charm. The food is straight forward red blooded American man food. My filet was cooked perfectly to order and was served with standard vegetables which were pretty good, but unspectacular. I took down a ton of complimentary bread before my meal, so the hearty portion size was a little intimidating.  I loved the old school Vegas vibe it had near Fremont Street. I loved that they didn't try too hard. The food is better than average, but it will not blow you away. This is all a nice change from most Vegas restaurants these days. Prices were pretty good compared to other Vegas restaurants.",

I have been going here for over 3 years and it always reminds me of that classic downtown hideaway that you only find out about through a recommendation from your barber.  It's located off 3rd street between Steward and Ogden.  Best way to get there is to head East on Steward from Main Street and hanging a left on 3rd.  Parking is valet which is not bad for a tip or you can park at the Horseshoe garage and walk over.     The fare ranges from your steak and salads to seafood and pasta.  For lunch I like the Steak Sandwich and Salads.  For dinner, the Porchinni Rubbed Ribeye or Shrimp George are great options, on an off night I might go for the Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf.  I am also really drawn to the sides of julienne carrots and zucchini that is served with most meals, they must be drowned in butter or something.  The staff are really friendly and helpful.  It's a nice relaxing place to grab a good meal with a friend that's a little more comfortable than you typical Outback but at the same time not as pricey or pretentious as you Bellagio Prime Steakhouse.",

    "text": "I am going to split my review in several parts. First I would give the hostess when we first arrived no stars. She asked me several times what my name was and if I had a reservation. She finally gave us a table in the front near the door. When we asked for another table she said we could move to a booth in about 15 minutes. We waited almost an hour for the booth and in that time several other people came in and were given other tables in the restaurant.    Once we got to our booth Brian our waiter was very attentive. I will give Brian five stars for his service for our entire meal.   The price of the meal includes sides so a good value for what you get.   I will gave the Chef one star.  There were four of us and we all ordered steaks. Only one out of the four meals was cooked correctly. One steak was ordered as medium, it was well done. My husbands steak was ordered as medium and it was medium rare. My steak was ordered as medium and I got rare.  I sent it back and when they brought it back it was only medium rare.  I told them to redo the whole meal. When they finally brought the new steak it was cooked perfectly. But everyone else had finished their meal so I just had them box it to eat later.  William the asst manager only charged us for two meals so at least they tried to make it right. I am not sure I will come again. Perhaps the regular chef was on vacation last night. Vegas offers many restaurants to choose from.",

You have to appreciate a high class steak house that isn't afraid to give you a huge steak for  a reasonable price just because Gordon Ramsey charges three times as much for half the food in his fancy spot on the strip. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgable. Bartender knew what he was doing, as well. Now that I know about this spot, I might just eat here every time I'm in Vegas.",

It was way above our expectations. The waiters were right on the ball,  They had no problem giving us tips on food and drinks and answering all of our questions. My Dad and I ordered the steak, he had shrimp with it, and my Mom had the pork chop. All were cooked to perfection. My parents had the onion soup and loved it. The bread with the butter and red wine vinaigrette, and the artichoke dip were all wonderful as well. My only complaint was the mushroom soup. To me it was spicy. Too much seasoning for me. We all had a martini, and they were made just right. We will be going back,",

The first booth that they offered to us had a cracked vinyl seat so we requested a different table. The second booth was perfect. I strongly recommend sitting in a booth rather than a table when you  eat here. The booths have high wooden walls that allow complete privacy and the sense of intimacy. Our server came by almost immediately to take our drink orders and to explain the specials for the night. My wife and I decided to share the chopped salad and the drunken steak. The chopped salad, even when shared, was huge and difficult to finish despite it being delicious. The drunken steak did not appear to be huge especially since it was shared. It turns out that appearances were deceiving. The steak was more than ample to the two of us. It was cooked to perfection exactly as we had ordered. This is a terrific place to eat either before or after going to the Smith Center. Excellent food, service, and ambience.",

I read some reviews before we got there and was expecting a great experience, but I definitely left disappointed.  I will start by saying that the service was excellent, and they were very accommodating for our large group. Everything about the food was very average. We ordered quite a selection of the appetizers and nothing really stood out for me. The best part may have been the garlic bread that came with goat cheese marinara.  I ordered the NY strip rare and it came out medium. It was a very disappointing piece of meat. No one else in the group was impressed with their meals, although the one person who got the porcini-crusted ribeye seemed very happy.  I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It's Vegas, and there are many other restaurants that are way better.",

The restaurant is just a half block from the Mob Museum just off Fremont Street.  Just follow the crowd to the place and enjoy.  As soon as you walk in to  Triple George Grill you know, somehow you know,  you are in for a real experience.  The menu was diverse including a great variety of menu items, sides and appetizers.  The fried chicken is one not frequently found in any restaurant - give it a try for sure.  It is so hard to recommend a single menu item.  What I suggest is to get there at 1100hrs for an early lunch, stay to drink, then in no time it's time for dinner.  Take the time to relax and enjoy a wonderful Manhattan cocktail.  A cocktail to sip, enjoy and take your time with your spouse or your friends.  We will definitely go again and again and again.  MANGA!!",

All four of us enjoyed our dinner from drinks to dessert...no complaints. Cocktails here are very good....1/2 the restaurant is a huge very crowded bar...separate from the dining area. A Makers Mark old fashioned....Manhattans made with Bullet Rye and Woodford reserve as well as a pinot grigio all earned high praise. Salads were OK. Three of us had the Caesar,citrus and wedge salads....one had the beef barley soup. all happy with the choices. Potato and vegetable come with the entrees. broccolini is not my cup of tea so I added on creamed spinach and creamed corn and was happy I did. Steaks are the stars here. Two of us had the ribeye....the other two has the petite filet.Meat was tender and tasty and cooked perfectly. We all split an apple cobbler for dessert..less successful with some sort of frozen topping. Steaks are Vegas strip steakhouse quality at 2/3 the price. if you can overcome the loud atmosphere...you have found yourself an excellent place to enjoy dinner.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying the food we had order was delicious and plentiful but unfortunately this review will mainly be about our lack of service we had received on Wednesday night around 8:30. Before I move there, let me say my boyfriends filet and huge bake potato was delicious and my \"chicken\" stir fry from their 'Glegan' menu was absolutely fantastic and quite tasty! Their Glegan menu is a gluten-free vegan menu offered to customers with a different eating lifestyle and I've included a picture of the menu but now onto our below average service....  Once entered, our party of 2 was immediately greeted by the hostess and we were seated to the back right of the restaurant along the brick wall. We sat there for about 10 mins and never once were we greeted, not even offered water. My bf wanted to immediately move to the bar thinking we would receive better service but I held out a little longer but never once did any server look our direction.  At that moment the hostess came back to seat a new table and we explained to her our situation and wanted to move up to the bar.  She offered to grab a server but at that time we weren't interested in someone who wasn't interested in us so we moved.  Once we sat at the bar, she asked the bartender to take care of us and he said \"I can't\" while shaking his head no.  Then she, the hostess, took matters into her own hand and grabbed our drink orders and appetizer. She really was trying to make a bad situation better and we greatly recognized her effort and it kept us from leaving.    After getting our drinks and salad, she told us to enjoy the rest of our meal and walked back up to the front.  During this time we had gone unacknowledged once again.  Watching every server and the bartender walk by us and not offering us help, menus still in front of us.  One server had asked if we were helped and I said the hostess was helping us but I guess further communication wasn't made within the staff, he thought that meant we were taken care of.  I watched everyone including the manager who I believed was made aware of our situation by the hostess, work and see how long it would be before we were assisted again. Finally I see the mgr motion to a server to check on us in which she came over and asked if we needed anything. She took our order and then passed it along to who would finally be taking care of us.   Even though the servers were apologetic (we eventually had to explain to them how horrible everything had been) no one seemed to notice until we spoke out loud. The mgr never once stopped by and our full bill was presented at the end.  We were given a free glass of white wine bc the bartender said it was extra but I wasn't in the mood to really have it.  I was really looking forward to eating here, esp with their Glegan menu but I won't be rushing back. A place with these types of prices should offer way better service and not pawn off guests from one server to another....or be told \"I can't\". This city offers way too many steakhouses to choose from to have such an unorganized venue.  I will say again the food was delicious and Glegan Menu is an awesome touch.",

The service was subpar, Marte, the bartender was less than welcoming. It was approximately 10 minutes before she acknowledged us at the bar and we had to ask her to give us menus. It then took her longer to come back and get our order. She was curt and seemed annoyed we were at the bar. We stayed after happy hour ended and noticed how friendly she got with the full prices guests. It appeared as though she didn't care to treat the happy hour guests with excellent service because we were paying half price and ultimately may not get tipped appropriately. The bartender who was not servicing us was much friendly and checked on us more than Marte did. I would love to come back, I just hope I get a more welcoming experience.",

    "text": "I really wanted to be more impressed with this place...had such high hopes.  We walked in at 5 till 4 (when they switch to Dinner menu) and were seated.  The booth was soo comfortable & the atmosphere was great.  We started looking at the menu and didn't see some of the dishes that people had mentioned and photographed in our review of the Yelp site.  So, I asked about having a ribeye on the menu and the waitress asked if we would like to see the dinner menus.  Uh, yeah, didn't even think to look.  Asked about the specials and she said \"the chefs are setting them now\".  Alrighty, then.  So, we ordered the chicken parmesan with fettuccini alfredo instead of the pasta with red sauce for $16ish, and the 16 oz ribeye for $38...add a side of creamed corn $6.  Food took quite a while...especially since there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in the whole place.  Service was spotty, refills were slow.  I ordered my 16 oz ribeye medium.  What I got was a mid-well to well done steak that looked about 5 oz short.  The waitress was there when I cut into my steak and promptly returned it to the kitchen.  We still haven't gotten our creamed corn.  My hubby LOVED his chicken parm...it was one of the best either of us has had, and that's his jam.  My re-fired order took forever...like hubby on his last 2 bites already, forever.  I cut into it and it was mid-rare at best.  The manager came to check on the steak issue and I showed him it was  not medium.  I wasn't giving my plate up this time...I was starving!  So, I ate it as is.  Don't get me wrong, this was a good steak, it just wasn't what I ordered...especially for $38.  My hubby and I shared it along with the creamed corn that only arrived with my second steak.  At the end, they took off the iced tea and corn for my troubles...about 9 bucks, so that's something.  My hubby gave his dish a resounding 5 stars, my food was good, but overall experience was a 3.",

    "text": "This is my second visit to Triple George Grill, my first meal ( a 6oz fillet minion) was average and accompanied with two stalls of very over cooked and crispy broccoli. My husbands steak was very good and flavorful, so I wrote my experience off to bad luck. Last night we were back (7 days after the first visit), I ordered a light meal of Shrimp Bisque, Beef Wellington and a Caesar salad. The cup of bisque ($9) was flavorless and required a fair bit of salt and pepper to make it edible. The Beef Wellington ($13.) was a 4x4 square of pastry, filled with chopped beef, pearl onions and runny tasteless gravy. This was a Cornish Pastie ( a poor one at that) not Beef Wellington, I was unable to eat it, and was bitterly disappointed. The side Caesar salad ($9), was saturated in dressing and cheese, overpowering the small quantity of lettuce on the plate, again I could not finish the salad. Finally I ordered a double vodka & soda which came is a short highball glass, the final insult to injury was to discover the double drink cost $20.00!  Regrettably though I enjoyed the venue and location of this restaurant, I will not be returning, it is overpriced and has poor quality control.",

    "text": "After dining here for the first time there's no doubt this place lives up to the hype - I've had several people recommend this restaurant over the years, it's by no means one of the historic venues that's been around for decades, this restaurant can trace its roots to the revitalization of the downtown area and its contribution has already reached legendary status. We made reservations and although I would of loved to have dined at the bar it wasn't an option this day, so we were seated in the dining area to the right of the bar area. The white table clothes gives the restaurant a hint of a stiffer upper lip classic appearance but the dress code seems to be a little relaxed, the extensive list of world class whiskeys and bourbons is where the nostalgia begins - it's really quite impressive.  As impressive as the restaurant is in so many ways it's the customer service that really sets this place apart - by some stroke of luck we were seated in Stephanie's section and that my friend really elevated the over-all experience. She introduced herself in a very friendly and professional manner instilling confidence that tonight's table service would be exceptional. After ensuring we were comfortable with our table she took our drink orders and provided some highlights of the menu and answered any questions we had. In my opinion a great steak dinner should be pretty simple - dinner service started with a basket of very nice bread hot from the oven with softened butter, I chose a wedge salad which I always substitute ranch dressing for the normally paired bleu cheese but kept the crumbles. The portion was perfect and the ingredients were crisp and very fresh and begging for a few turns of freshly ground pepper as you can see I chose to go a little beyond a few turns.   I paired my medium rare ribeye with sauteed asparagus even though by default the entree comes with a few roasted potatoes. The steak was cooked exactly to the right temperature and the quality of the ribeye was impressive, the the range of quality for rib-eyes varies greatly so when you find a restaurant that serves the great ones, its doubtful you'll eat any other cut going forward. The asparagus turned out to be an excellent pairing it was buttery and tender without being cooked to death. I for one loved the entire experience here and I look forward to my next visit - this place really is something special...",

We had reservations and on arrival we were seated by a very friendly hostess. Our waitress Rebecca (hopefully I remembered the name correctly) arrived promptly to take our drink order and then our food order shortly thereafter.   My wife ordered a Filet and I ordered a Ribeye to which we both ordered to be cooked at Medium. I ordered a side of Lobster Mac. I also started with a cup of New England Clam Chowder.   The chowder was very delicious but thick and filling. My steak came out a medium well to well done. This was unfortunate because it dried out the steak and made it tougher to eat. Don't get me wrong it still tasted good and was seasoned perfectly. I could not finish it because it hot too hard to eat. I know this is not the norm here because I've only had delicious perfectly cooked steaks in the past. I also tried my wife's filet which she enjoyed and it was amazing. The lobster Mac was delicious and can honestly be enjoyed on its own.   Our server Rebecca was excellent and is great at what she does. She stayed on top of things the entire time. I did point out the issue with my steak just to have mentioned but not to complain at all. She was apologetic for this and advised I could have mentioned earlier so it could be made right. It was not worth sending back because my experience was still good here. The manager also came by and was also very friendly and apologized for the steak. This was a nice touch but not necessary at all. I still appreciated that she came by.   Overall this is a great place to visit and had very friendly and efficient employees across the board. I will be returning and highly recommend to anyone thinking of going. My compliments to everyone that took care of us and a thank you for the tasty complimentary dessert!",

There was a very large bar and a tv in our booth area.  Somehow I knew the food would be good.  To my surprise the food was Great! Our waitress was friendly and knew the menu well.

We got reservations for 1030 for 6 on a Saturday night and they were able to accommodate us no problem.  We ate in the main dining room where the kitchen is located. Seating is cozy and private because of high wall wood partitions. They also have a dining area to the right and another larger bar section in the room on the left.   Date and I ordered the surf and turf special that comes with bone in rib eye and lobster tail for two. The rib eye was juicy and flavorful, cooked perfectly. Gf complained that I had given her some fatty sections in her portion though. Lobster was about 1.2-1.5 lbs tail. It was well seasoned but a little over in my opinion. No butter was provided but I didn't need it.   Our party had a great time and the staff were attentive and service as well as food was exceptional. I would definitely come back.",

I'm not a big fan of shrimp so my only complain is that there were too many shrimp (4 total).  *Filet mignon with porchini crust (4 stars, add $6 for porchini crust). I had high anticipation of this steak. It was cooked to the perfect medium-rare (see picture for prove), but the porchini crust didn't add much to the flavor. I would recommend the steak if you are in the mood for a nice piece of juicy meat.  *Scallop risotto (3.5 stars) - Good risotto, al dente, not too special.   Drink:  *Blueberry lemondrop martini - Tbh, I didn't try it. But the girls with me each ordered 2. I can only assume it was really really good.",

He said it was his favorite restaurant and I completely understand why. He suggested we start with the baked brie & red sauce and cup of clam chowder. These are two of my favorite things so the date was going pretty well. Haha He also recommended the spicy shrimp & scallop pasta and oh my goodness it was delicious. The guy didn't last but I've been back several times for the pasta! I'm obsessed!  Tonight I took me coworkers here and since born of them were ordering the pasta I decided to try something new. I ordered the seafood cioppino, but I wasn't worried... I knew I could sneak some of theirs! Everything was absolutely delicious! They really liked the sinful indulgent triple chocolate dessert... I didn't try it but it looked amazing. I was very happy with my creme Brule! This place really does a great dinner. My only complaint was that they bring out sourdough bread (my favorite) however, my boss isn't a fan and when we asked about other bread options she said there wasn't any... But all of us received garlic bread with our entrees. It's a small thing, but maybe she could have said that she could bring garlic bread for an extra charge.",

I was very impressed and amused by the attentive service our waitress, Brenda, provided me and my friends. She was super sweet and had a great sense of humor, which really elevated my dining experience here.   In terms of the food, I ordered the 16 oz. ribeye (rare) and added jumbo shrimp to my order. They were able to accommodate my dietary preferences and gave me extra vegetables instead of mashed potatoes. The overall taste of my food was good, and I cleaned my plate entirely. My only knock-off is that the steak was slightly overcooked and more medium rare than rare as I had asked for. This was probably due to the thinness of the steak, since it was not a thick cut of meat.  The pricing of everything on the menu is on par with your standard seafood/steakhouse restaurant, so no complaints here. All in all, this is a solid restaurant, and I really appreciate the outstanding service!",

    "text": "This place used to be really good, but my last two experiences have really changed my opinion of Triple George. First-timers, note that their website does not accurately reflect prices of their menu items - we noticed price variations from $5-6 for less expensive items all the way up to $14-15 on steaks and some seafood this time around.  First, they appear to have gotten rid of their valet (again, website still features it), meaning your options, as far as I can tell, are to park in the Downtown Grand valet and walk a block (fine, as long as the valet isn't full, as it was during the first of these bad visits) or try your luck at one of the various garages around downtown. For the mid-to-upper class dining experience, definitely not the best. The valet needs to come back.  Second, the service has gotten worse and worse with each visit. We frequently come to Triple George before catching a show at the Smith Center, and normally this is not a problem. They even used to have special Smith Center-themed menus (these haven't been around the last few times) and were on top of their game to get you out the door in time for a show. For our most recent visit, we told them (as we usually do) that we had a show at 7:30. Still, we nearly missed seeing The Book of Mormon, despite arriving at Triple George nearly two hours before showtime. The reason? The food came out over an hour after ordering. And it was nothing special - a steak, chicken saltimbocca, salmon, and roasted chicken, all of which had to be eaten in about 10 minutes to make up for the time lost. That is unacceptable.   The food? I've had better. The steaks are priced relatively well respective to other Las Vegas steak places, though that's still overpriced. Steaks are just okay - a little thin in my opinion, so they end up a little overcooked (I order rare to get medium rare) - but they have a decent variety. Taste is just average. The chicken/pasta options are really bland. They have pretty decent drink options if that's your thing (I stuck with a beer).   At least at some of the other steakhouses around the city you tend to lose the shorts/t-shirt crowd, but not here. I mean, that's downtown (it's sandwiched between a pizza place and the Hogs and Heifers biker bar), but that just isn't what I am looking for. I haven't been here for lunch (I've heard it's good), so I can't comment on that.",

I had the Petit Filet & he had the Strip. Mine was a perfect medium & his was rare even though he ordered it medium. He didn't want to send it back and ate it anyway. The steaks were very tender, the veggies, mashed potatoes and rice tasty too. Get the spinach dip appetizer, it's wonderful & enough to feed four people. We shared the Warm Chocolate Indulgence dessert and loved it. Even the bread & ice tea were good!  Only a couple things were kind of a bummer. You have to squeeze through the bar to get to the dark wood paneled dining room, which is going for an elegant vibe and then they stick a couple of big screen TVs playing basket ball games on the wall all during dinner. Waitress forgot our salads and I had to ask her twice for my Yelp discount. Dress code this night seemed to be shorts, sneakers & wife beaters. We only spent about $100 on dinner. Oh well, I guess in Vegas you have to spend more than that to get seated next to someone in a collared shirt & long pants.",

The steamed clams are delicious. My hubby and I decided to share a main entree due to the large portion appetizers. We went for the drunken hanger steak-awesome!!!   The mashed potatoes was the only thing that was gross. Our server immediately replaced it with another side of our choice. All in all it was a great dining experience.

Pricing and food is great which makes it a great option to other expensive steak houses around.  You can have a steak or a seafood dish for a great value here and add preferred sides to it for $5 each. Go for a starter if you want to be fancy, or have a burger to be safe. You can do whatever you like, so i guess its a perfect spot for an unanimous party.  If you dare to leave freemonts lights for a while and are able to walk 1 1/2 block away, you will find this little gem and have a great dinner.",

My hubby had something with shrimp( it was recommended by our waitress) my mom got fish and chips, son- some type of Italian style chicken. Our cousins got salmon and another dish. We were seated outside and it was chilly so we asked for a heater...our cousins had a show to go to and when we sat down the waitress assured us that we'd be done in an hour so they wouldn't be late. We didn't see our waitress for about 30 minutes I asked the hostess where the heater and salads were. She said they were plating our dishes now. I looked around the inside was fairly empty. I had to ask about 15 minutes later because they only had 20 minutes to get their plate eat and get to the show. Finally our food came and it looked nice. My potatoes tasted like instant potatoes. The veggies were good, and my lemon chicken was cooked well but under seasoned. My hubby hated his dish. Not a single person at our table said their food was good. It's not terrible but definitely not worth the cost. I'd prefer to go to claim jumper or Brio...hell even Church's Chicken is better than here. On a scale of 1-10...

That doesn't necessarily mean you can't hear outside conversations - you can. But it is nice to dine outside of the view of the entire restaurant. We went for linner (that time between lunch & dinner), so got right in & seated. Our waiter was prompt with the drinks, which were amazing (see photos). We shared the caprice salad - 3 beefs steak tomatoes with a very good mozzarella and excellent balsamic. We also shared an order of calamari. The highlight of that was the aioli they served alongside it.  And just to be sure we had our bases covered, we ordered the veggie wrap with their truffle oil fries.  Veggie wrap was ok. The veggies were all soggy as they had been sauteed together for too long. The fries...oh geez. They are rich rich rich, but oh so good. Definitely want to share those. They put Parmesan on them with the truffle oil, so the salt content is pretty high. They should hold off on salting the fries when they make them trufflized (I made that word up). That aside, they are mmm mmm delicious.  My co-linner friend ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. The meatballs were microwaved to rock hard.   Last, but not least, the service was slouchy. We waited an excessive amount of time to order and a ridiculously long time for our food to arrive (perhaps why the meatballs were like rocks??).  Overall, linner was mediocre when you combine delicious drinks & various high points in the food with the less than desirable waits.",

Its located on 3rd street in downtown just steps away from the Grand hotel and casino. We had the following:  House Salad $ 6.95  Crabcake $11.95  Swordfish with caper beurre blanc $22.95  6 oz Filet Mignon $25.95  The crab cake was pretty good albeit a little overpriced. We got salad bc i thought at the time that our entrees would be just the protein and rice. My wife's swordfish was on the dry side and needed a bit more sauce. We both ordered rice pilaf with our entree and my wife said she loved the rice more than the fish. I tried mine and it was pretty tasty...probably the best rice pilaf i've tasted in a resto. The filet mignon was soft, tender, and grilled well. The entrees came with sauteed zucchini and yellow squash btw. Overall, we enjoyed the food and would come back here again for a good steak.   P.S. Did anyone see a dessert menu cause i didn't...",

My idea originally was to go to a cheaper place and not do our one nicer meal in old vegas but it just worked out that we ended up at Triple George.  I knew Triple George from yelp and steak seemed to be the way to go, so I was looking forward to a great meal of red meat.  It was a Sunday, but it was packed (yea for 3 day weekends), we couldn't get a table so they sent us to the back bar.  Now usually I'm not a big fan of sitting in front of a keno screen, but hey, with no reservations and last second decision to eat here, at least we got a spot.  The bartender was very busy but really nice.  Service was a tad slow but again, the restaurant was completely full and the meal made up for it.  My girlfriend got a scallop pasta dish and I chose the rib-eye for myself....wow, what a damn good steak.  We had great conversation with a gentleman next to us and savored the great flavors of the food, I hardly noticed anymore the fact that we had this little bar table setup hanging halfway off the bar with flashing video poker in front of me.  Triple George is a very, very good steakhouse and really for Vegas the prices are very reasonable.  If you want a good cut of meat in downtown, Triple George is a great choice.",

We were meeting a few friends for a birthday gathering and he wanted to go to Triple George. We have wanted to try eating here so we were in. We had reservations and were seated promptly. We had a large group of 9 so I was excited to see how service would be. Always a good test for how you can handle things in my opinion. Drink orders were taken immediately and bread was brought soon after. Their drink selection is good and the orders were delivered pretty quick. They have the wine josie likes so that on the spouses side of things is nice. Most the table ordered a salad before the meal I had the ceasar salad Josie had the caprese salad. My Ceasar was a little bland, i expected the pop in flavor you get from a little pepper or the capers that would go into a Ceasar. Ceasar needed Season(ing). The rest of the table had a mix of the same one had the Beefsteak tomato salad he said it was crisp and delicious.   Entre...I had the Fish n Chips, decided to keep it small since I normally finish the wife's meal. Fish was hot and fresh out the fryer. Batter on the fish was perfect. Not a fan when they over batter. Fries were seasoned nice. Not sure if Tarter sauce was house made but it was thicker than most that I have had. Coleslaw was perfect shredded cabbage and carrots just the right hint of vinegar and mayo if that is what they used. JOsie had the Ribeye with \"Chef's Choice Sides\" which means waitress not telling you how many choices for sides. From a time standpoint love this idea. Steak she ordered medium and it came more mid rare which in my opinion is the only way to order steak. Sides of Vegetable and Mashed potatoes. Steak had a perfect sear and great seasoning nothing overdone. If you read my reviews you know how I feel about pricey steaks that can be done at home better. This was a good price and done as good as I could have done. Potatoes were your average mashed but the Veg had good flavor.   Around the table we had a fried chicken that was hot as ordered. He said it was good seasoned well but hot when he ate it. Filet response from one in our party said is was good and tender but more mid rare to rare again how steak should be done but he ordered medium. Most had steak or steak and lobster, all or most had same response to flavor and enjoyment that we had. A couple had the Ahi salad as an entre. One comment stated that 4 slices of Ahi over a pile of greens was not worth the price. I agree your going to give as an entre throw a bit more protein on the plate.   We had a good time. Beverages were filled over again if needed. Waitress was very on top of things. Manager came by a few times to be sure we were satisfied. They did validate tickets from Downtown Grand valet so good there. We will go back i recommend if you have not been you should try it.  I checked in of course on Yelp and received 15% off one item. We split checks so we deducted from steak price. 2 others also took part of the Yelp experience.",

For those who know Vegas, there's no shortage of awesome places to eat but TGG is the place we keep coming to because they have the three things we love for our annual gathering.... Great food, great drinks, and awesome service!  This place has the feel of an old style steakhouse with simple and perfectly cooked rib-eyes, classic drinks that are made by REAL bartenders, and service that makes sure your needs are met yet not overbearing.    Thanks to the staff at Triple George for another great meal... we'll be back next year!",

    "text": "This place has been on my 'TO EAT' list for a while now. It seemed perfect for my first meal of the New Year! To start, I love the free parking right in front of the place. Parking downtown is never this convenient. It was very beautiful and classy, old school Vegas feeling when I walked in. A high bar with big private booths that had coat racks. We were greeted and sat quickly. I unfortunately was not offered a cocktail menu, but I more wanted it out of curiosity not for a beverage. We started off with a Caesar salad, a clam chowder, and a soup of the day Beef Noodle. All of them were amazing. The chowder reminded me of when I was on the coast of Oregon with big fresh clams and the perfect thick consistency. Cracked black pepper would have made my salad ideal, and the beef noodle soup was up to par and then some.  For our entrees we went with the steak sandwich. Not too much fat, juicy and cooked well. Still asked for A-1. Maybe a little marinade or dry rub wouldn't hurt. The dipping sauce for the French fries was unique but good. Secondly was the special of the day, Halibut topped with andouille sausage, onions, peppers, and a Cajun cream sauce served with carrots, green beans and a wild rice pilaf. This dish was absolutely delicious except for my fish was piping hot and my sides were luke warm. As for flavor, I couldn't have asked for much more.  We finish with a strawberry cheesecake. One of the best crusts ever! Along with a cappuccino that truly finished my meal perfectly.  An $80 lunch was not what I was expecting, but they do have a $10 under $10 menu so I could have chose cheaper options. I'd love to return for dinner, or maybe next door to Mob Bar for some of their cocktails and goodies served from Triple George!",

I had the scallop and shrimp linguini and it was terrific. Scallops were big and cooked perfectly. Shrimp also done well and very fresh. Serving was generous. My husband had the petite steak which he said was cooked a perfect rare and good flavor. House salads were an extra charge but greens were fresh.  With two drinks a piece it came to about $100 for two without tip. A little expensive but OK for the quality of food.",

Initially to get seated took a long time, no host staff was there. when one finally came my party (5 of us) requested outdoor seating. I was told that they just needed to clean a table off, not a problem so we waited.  After a minute of waiting, another party of 5 came, and asked to be seated out side.  they were sat immediately!  the service was so slow. just from sitting down to getting a waiter to come took 10 minutes. the food took forever to come out, and when it did the staff who brought it out had a very bad attitude. We waited such a long time for the check, and had to track the server down. When i went to use the restroom i looked into the indoor seating and was amazed to see it was almost empty which confused me to why the service so slow.  Needless to say, due to the poor service I received I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "I love how Triple George Grill takes you back in time with its dark wood paneling and cubicle style seating. It makes you feel like you are at a 'oldtime' steakhouse back when the mob ran the strip. But it wasn't only the looks that made an impact on me, it was the delicious food.   We read about how wonderful the butter and bread that was served before your meal and the reviewers were not lying, it was DELICIOUS! The butter was so addicting which almost made it difficult for me to finish my actual meal. I ordered the power lunch special and it was pretty filling and a good deal. I was a little surprised that they did not serve the 'soup' portion of the lunch prior to my meal but once it came out, it all made sense. I thought it was clever that they gave me a huge plate that housed my soup, half sandwich, truffle fries and my dessert - cheesecake. The meal also included a non-alcoholic drink. All of this for just $15.99. Not bad at all. I went ahead and shared my dessert even though it was so yummy.    If you want to get away from the newer strip and enjoy some delicious food for good prices, make sure you go downtown to Triple George Grill!",

We arrived 10 minutes early for our Friday night reservation and we walked right in, no waiting.   The restaurant has outdoor seating and is located between Freemont Street Experience and The Mob Museum.  Located next to Hoggs & Heffers,  so keep that in mind before sitting outside.   Old school, rustic vibe which we loved. We sat in the main dinner room by William the host and our waiter was Brian. Not overly busy for a Friday night and I am not sure why because the food was out of this world and the prices were extremely fair for the dining experience at this restaurant.  I am guessing it is the location,  but this place on the strip and they would be a high dining establishment.  Casual attire, or feel free to dress up either way you are fine.  Goat cheese in marinara sauce was very tasty,  nice size portion and fairly priced. The drinks were very reasonable with plenty of alcohol in rum and coke I ordered.  The wine we also ordered was very cold and again a perfect size and price.  The 16oz NY Strip was out of this world,  one of the best I have had. Very fairly price for quality of meat and portion.  I compare it to something you would find in a high end steak house.  The stuff shrimp with crab meat was also fantastic,  nice size portion.   When back in Vegas this will be a place we visit again",

The rice pilaf and veggies came on the side and it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten!  The reason for the 4 stars is the service was just alright.  The waiter was nice but not attentive at all.   I am a server for over 15 years and I expect a few check-ins.   He was friendly when greeting us and suggested a few things when I prompted him.  We got our drinks, cherry lemon drop!  Delicious! Then he got our order and we literally didn't see him the entire time we waited for our food.  Well we saw him... He walked by our table about 10 times but never even looked at us or check on us.   We would have ordered another round of drinks or two!  We waited for our food which was brought out to us by their food runner and then our waiter did come over when I stared at him.  We asked for another round and he brought our drinks but I never got asked if we enjoyed our food... Thankfully we did!   I would totally understand if they were busy but it was late Thursday night and he was not that busy.   Hostess and food runner and bussed were the nicest people there.  Service needs to change.  We will be back next time we want to splurge and hopefully he was just having an off night but if I get service like that again we won't be back!",

The food, being the best thing, was definitely above average - and that's True even with the grilled vegetable plate I ordered. The service was prompt and the servers had good personalities. Nice ambience, lighting not to dark or light and the bread pudding dessert was amazing!  I WILL be back :)",

The second time I brought my friend for lunch, he remembered that she was a vegan and brought her a vegan menu.

As you walk in, it appears small, but extends quite a ways to the back and sides.   On this night, I took friends here for dinner. We sat outside on a beautiful evening. The challenge is the music from Hogs & Heifers next door is pretty loud, although not overbearing. Our waitress was swift and thorough. She explained that this is a \"San Fransisco Style\" grill, meaning they specialize in steak and seafood, she said. So, I ordered the scallop special and my wife had the chicken pot pie. The sear was good on the scallops, and they were seasoned nicely. The chicken pie, though, was under seasoned and dry. The bartender knew the wine list and selected a nice wine based on our meal and my preferred favors.  I don't know that I'd return for food...maybe...but it will remain a fav for cocktails.",

If you are looking for a quieter meal and would like to have conversations with your party, than definitely sit inside. They have tables outside however it can get noisy with all the drunks walking by, lingering smokers, noisy motorcycles and loud music from the bar next door. The wine list is extensive and there are good options by the glass. The new england clam chowder was good as was the salmon and pot roast entrees. The service was good.

In doing a quick search in Yelp for a steak place near our hotel (we were staying at the Freemont), Triple George Grill came up. We loved this place because it reminded us of a few steakhouses in Chicago (mostly Wildfire) but less \"chain-like\". The staff is very friendly and accommodating. In fact, we were sitting in an extremely loud room and could barely hear each other so we asked to be moved and the hostess and waitstaff was very cool about it (which, yes, they should be but many places might give you attitude). Our steaks were cooked perfectly. Our drinks were delicious. I had the one with the hibiscus flower in it and yeah, you eat the flower - it has the taste and texture of a fruit roll-up. Loved it!  We will definitely come back when we are in town again!",

    "text": "I guess everyone else leaving 5 star reviews must be drink because the food here was average tasting, but then for the price you're paying you're better off just going to a buffet for the same quality of food. The food placement on the plate was nothing special they just throw some made out of a box tasting mashed potatoes, with some steamed vegetable and a steak on a plate. There was no presentation to it at all. I'm paying $50 for a steak and it comes out almost 45 minutes after we placed the order because of some issue with the kitchen. This guys comes to apologize but doesn't even offer a free dessert for the table or anything which is ridiculous for this expensive ass restaurant not to at least do that. Seriously worst experience ever here. Food definitely isn't worth the price, the environment it loud and annoying because it's just groups of loud drunk people who have no respect for other families trying to enjoy a meal together. Managers don't say anything to them because it's a large party paying more. And the waitress kept spilling water when she would pour and leave the table wet on top of it all. There are way better steakhouses  for less. Check out Echo and Rig steak house instead if you're in vegas! Cheaper and the meat is the best tasting you can find! Especially if you like rare or medium rare!!! DONT EAT HERE! Over priced! Bad service! Loud drunk guest!",

As a note to Norm K, I had french fries with my filet as I always have in the past when I've dined there. (They're not on the menu as a filet option, but they're always available if you request - and they're good.) There's a parking garage about 1/4 of a block away, and TG validates. We spent $280 (including a generous tip) for the meal which included 6 drinks amongst the four of us. Elsewhere it would have cost close to $350-400 at most name/good steakhouses.

Even before downtown 3rd was developed into the nice hangout/restaurant row that it is now, Triple George has been here every step of way as one of the anchors of downtown's redevelopment.  The food is excellent w/solid choices of meat, seafood, and even vegan dishes that will satisfy most taste buds.  Steaks are underrated here as well as they have a very delicious rib-eye that's big enough for two. Other goto is the chicken christopher w/mash potatoes and greens. Also a great place to have dinner before or after The Smith Center as you can take Ogden all the way there.",

From the greeting at the hostess stand we were brought to an enclosed private booth were we were greeted by Maddy our busser who promptly provided water and greeted us with a friendly smile. Shortly after, we were greeted by our server Nadia who provided stellar service. She provided recommendations for food and drinks. We drove her crazy back and forth, and she did it with a smile, and she was very personable. There were never any dishes left on our table for more than a couple minutes. Either Knight or Maddy had everything cleared and water refilled promptly. Food was very good and can't wait to come back again.",

My water was promptly refilled when empty, the food came out quickly, and the check followed promptly after the completion of our meal.   However, the food was as tasty as it was large. Sure, I was full after our meal was over, but I never felt as if the food \"wowed\" me. The fries were soggy, and the mushroom to burger ratio was way too high.   I'd recommend trying this place for the portion sizes alone, so I will be back. However, I suggest to skip the burger and try a steak!",

The service here is exceptional and the drinks are Vegas stiff but very flavorful. There is a large menu with a focus, as you'd expect, on steak and seafood. My last visit was with a group of 12 people and the menu was well represented around the table and no one had anything they didn't think was great.  The steaks are high quality and prepared exactly the way you order them. They are tender and juicy and melt in your mouth. A couple of unexpected favorites (I came back for lunch two days in a row) was the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pot Roast. These are perfectly executed classics.  The only reason I dropped one star is that twice in a row my soup was cold by the time they brought it out and it came too close to my entree from a timing standpoint and I found the service sitting outside on the patio to be lacking compared to the interior service. That said all of the waitstaff are knowledgable, friendly and more than willing to help.  If you are in downtown I'd definitely chose Triple George for dinner for the steaks and the ambiance, you won't be disappointed!",

Bartenders are quite knowledgeable and can make a mean classic martini, but had to be informed as to what a \"perfect martini\" is (which incidentally is a specific type of martini, and not just a classic martini made to perfection).

After looking at the menu, we decided we could get better food for less in Wisconsin (great places if you know where to go). When we paid our bar bill they did not give us our change back.

The hosts were nice, however I could not say the same for the female bartender - who to her defense did end up also serving us perhaps why she seemed so annoyed by our large group. The other waiter was great. I had an incident where I dropped my ticket validation so I rushed and ran back for it. When I returned the female bartender didn't tell me the drink left unattended was mine, despite mentioning my reasoning for stepping out. I would've preferred she had kept it on her side of the bar until I returned. Having not cared or not paid attention, she scolded me for having left and I was over sitting the bar by then so I took the drink left in the open on the counter, possibly drank out of potentially roofied, whatever, hesitant to drink it, I barely sipped not wanting to be ungrateful - it didn't taste weird fortunately, but it didn't taste good either.. It was not even close to what I expected from my order, when I ordered something else from the she was irked again to see I hadn't drank the gross drink she had made prior, though they were paid for. The appetizers were good, however when we ordered our meals I asked specifically for my steak medium rare and when they brought the plates they got mixed up and gave me the wrong order. When I finally got my plate the meat was so tough and chewy I was too grossed out, so i basically only drank and ate appetizers. Would not come back, not for food or service. I get it might've been the huge party was hard to keep up with, but there should've been more staff having known this reservation was made to accommodate such a large party.",

The server didn't seem to care about steps of service or maybe he didn't know them. We waited for about 10 minutes before getting acknowledged of our existence. During that time we finally did get greeted, there was no drink order and didn't get to hear the specials like the tables around us with a different server. We received our drinks after we ate the appetizers, had to stop someone to ask for plates to share the appetizers and water refills, and had to serve our own wine. All the while, our server came by (when he decided to stop by)with a happy smile as if we were enjoying the horrific service. I felt like I should have been on a prank show to test my frustration. We didn't get any acknowledgement that the entire experience was lousy. With too many employees walking by and lack of care for your guests, I doubt it will be a place we care to return. To top it off, our server was training someone! Wow. That's quite the example of setting yourself up for failure. This should be a nice restaurant.  You're paying for the good food and that is all. It's understandable I can't expect perfection, but some sort of \"sorry to keep you waiting\", \"thank you for your patience\", something said to let us know we are appreciated and not just an expected gratuity at the end would have been nice and changed our minds about this place. I hope they care to read this and re-train the staff about what steps of service means for every single guest and reconsider who does any training if you want this business to be successful. As a local, I really hoped I could be writing a better review and feel rather lenient to give 3 stars or an appropriate gratuity tonight without making a complaint.",

    "text": "We went to Triple George to celebrate this Father's Day and a 40th birthday party. My friend suggested the Grill due to a previous visit and the fact that they are supposed to have great steaks. We made reservations for 8-mind you 8 steak hungry, very thirsty, ready to spend and have a good time 8! From our first order of drinks, two martinis had to be sent back after waiting 20 minutes. After ordering some more drinks we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks and all 4 of the martinis tasted different. We all ordered dirty martinis and we all taste tested that all were different.  After waiting so very long for drinks, we ordered some appetizers. Mediocre presentation and already bad service, it was like our table had done something wrong we were not being attended to. You cannot share the calamari because it comes in a french fry scoop and the artichoke spinach dip was cold on the inside, and do not count on sharing the $13 seared Ahi because for that price you get 4 lil strips! So now we have been here just a little over an hour and we are hungry. We ALL order steaks, due to my buddy's recommendation. Orders where placed and thank goodness we brought a bottle of wine because most of us could not finish our martinis and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes for a drink. After 25 minutes of placing our order, the waitress (whom we barely saw most of our experience) brought to our attention THEY ARE OUT OF STEAKS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! It took 25 minutes to tell all 8 of us this!!! If we would have known we would have already been eating steak at a real grill!!! My buddy was embarrassed, and we tried making light of it like ordering \"fish n chips\" at a steak house. Basically our waitress said that they would give us smaller cuts and some of us due to Father's Day and the Birthday switched so that they can have what they wanted...ridiculous! The ONLY good service that we received was the gentleman serving us water and the gentleman clearing the plates. They even laughed with us as how bad this situation was. By the time they brought us our smaller cuts and dinner we had been waiting since we ordered our dinner an hour! By now it seem that they are closing and we just want to get out of there. All of our steaks where fatty and nervy and most of us didn't even finish our meals. I feel sorry for the Dad's and our Birthday girl as this was a total waste of time and money.   They maybe allot of changes on Freemont but if anything needs a change it is Triple George Grill!!! Way over priced, bad service, and they may be out of STEAKS...BEWARE!!!",

    "text": "When I first walked in the place, it immediately reminded me of the Tadich Grill in San Francisco.  Similar old school bar and private wood booths.  We were there for Sunday brunch before a show at the Smith Center.  Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders.  The busser also brought us some great sourdough bread. We could order off both the brunch menu and the regular menu.  My mom and I both ordered off the brunch menu.  I had the crab Louie salad and my mom had the Belgium waffles.  The salad was really good.  Good scoop of crab, lots of veggies, good dressing.  My mom's waffles actually had cherries jubilee, whipped cream and ice cream on them.  Her side of bacon was nice and crispy.  The waitress came often to check on us.  One nice touch is that they kept refilling my ginger ale.  Typically you only get one glassful when you order ginger ale, unlike soda.  We definitely will try the restaurant again for dinner next time.  Lots of old school entrees on the menu that sound yummy.  They also had a yummy sounding donut dessert when we were there but unfortunately we were too full to have it.  Next time!  Parking is a little hard as they are doing construction all around.  Try to get a spot right in the front of the restaurant on 3rd Street.  If not, you might need to go in one of the casino parking garages nearby.",

And before I end my review I need to give a \"Shout Out\" to our server, CJ !!  He did a great job in every way. His knowledge of food and food preparation is impressive. Most servers can only tell you that steak comes from a beef cow. You won't be disappointed at this restaurant!",

The food was very good, pork chop succulent and the chicken saltibucco really tasty delivered quickly. The  martinis were made perfectly and the creme brulee was more than enough for two.  Set in a  funky area a block from Fremont with other attractions such as the Mob museum, we even checked out the biker bar next door and said hi to Rick and Big Hoss who were hanging out after having a warm evening's ride on their bikes....",

Man when I tell you after the first bite, I almost slid under the table because it made me weak. It was that GOOD. It was hot, flavorful and crispy with mashed potatoes that sopped up with the gravy also. It was served with fresh veggies that were also delicious. The gravy was so good that when no one was looking i ran my finger across the plate to get the excess. (Dont Judge Me). My co-worker had the pot roast. It wasn't yo mama's pot roast it was more like a short rib with a sauce that tasted like it was made with red wine as opposed to a country style gravy with beef drippings. It was absolutely deliciousness also. I came back the next day and had the ribeye. This was a disappointment because it was tough. I ordered it Medium well and it looked like it was bleeding and I could have sworn I seen it move and it sounded like it let out a MOOOO. I told the waitress and she assured me it was a red wine reduction and not blood. It wasn't flavorful or tender at all. What a let down. The day after that I ordered the baked onion soup and salad. The soup was absolutely deliciousness. It was flavorful, had the right amount of cheese and onion with a good bread/crouton ratio. Oh and when I checked in I received a coupon. (Thats where the extra star came from because a sister LOVES her some deals). Service was outstanding! I will surely come back here the next time Im in Vegas,",

I had never heard of the Triple George Grill.  I just knew we were going deep in the heart of Downtown to get there.  In the left armpit of the Fremont Experience lies a couple of different places I have yet to make the acquaintance of including a fun looking bar called Hogs and Heifers Saloon (note to self: I'll be back).  And of course, Triple George.  The place definitely appears to be the spot for lawyers to meet up and take clients out, possibly after getting their asses kicked at a morning hearing in court.  The dark wood interior of the bar and high-backed booths makes the place look intimate and cozy to the point you want to order the Oscar Goodman lunch special (just a Bombay Sapphire martini).  Maybe some other time.  I ordered the ahi salad to which I say, AH-YIPPEEEE, give me more of that.  Pieces of perfectly seared ahi topped the mixed greens, shredded red cabbage and carrots and fresh ginger with a light ginger dressing.  To die for.  Although that day someone was treating me to this lunch, I would have definitely spent the $14.95 for this salad.  It was just that damn good.  If lunch is this good, I'm definitely coming back for dinner.  When I come back for dinner, I'm getting a martini and having a nightcap at Hogs and Heifers next door.",

Ordered drinks and they didn't have the ingredients,  no biggie,  bring the menu to order another one...  Bloody Mary with shrimp,  bacon cedar cheese... Yum! What showed up was tomato juice and vodka,  nothing else. Went to the bar to get it fixed,  no bartender. Food came: truffle parm fries cold,  no cheese and no truffle (and this is just my pet peeve,  all scraps of fries,  little pieces) fried chicken skewers were panko breaded chicken strips and cold,  very disappointed.  In fact someone said are we at Dennys? Service was good and that was it. I've eaten there several times in the past and was excited to go.   Doubt I will ever go back with sooooo many other choices in the area now. Sad",

I had the cioppino, and it was the largest serving I've ever ordered. There were so many scallops and shrimp! The only thing I missed was the saffron rice (I guess that's not how they serve it here) Being out of state makes it difficult to plan a fixed menu reservation, but Kim was top notch in customer service. She answered every question I asked, and it turned out exactly how she said it would be. Our servers were also on the spot. No drink was empty, no dirty plate was left on the table. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting. Incredible value for your money considering the entrees range from $15-$30!",

Don't see anyone for about 20 minutes (out of water) went to the bar to get water.....food comes about 10 minutes later. Food was really good as usual, but what's up with the service in this joint when you sit at a table? Anyways, stared at empty plates for a bit before I just decided to get up and track down the server for my bill. Will I return? Yes. Will I ever sit at a table again? Never lol",

We took a cab from the Mandarin Oriental, thinking that downtown Las Vegas might be a refreshing change of pace. We were right. After wandering around Fremont Street, we made our way to Triple George.   Whatever you do, sit at the bar. And hope that Marti is your bartender/server. She recommended a couple of delicious entrees on the menu, she made some perfect martinis, and her level of service was just the right balance between friendly/chatty and professional.   It reminded me of the kind of place you'd find in old San Francisco. The food was second only to the hospitality.",

It was a Sunday night and it was pretty slow so there was no wait for a table.  The service was okay, nothing special.  We didn't order drinks right away and told him we were going to order wine with dinner, but he never came back so we had to flag him down so we could place our wine order.  I ordered the petite filet and a loaded baked potato medium rare.  My friend ordered a NY strip steak.  Both came out in a reasonable amount of time, but my petite filet was absolutely tiny.  The smallest petite filet I think I've ever seen in any steakhouse.  On top of that, it was medium, not medium rare.  I was with a group I didn't know very well so I didn't want to be the \"high-maintenance\" girl so I just ate it, but I was sorely disappointed. For the price, it's just not worth it.    There are too many other great food options downtown to waste this much money on a steak that should've been cooked to perfection on the first try.    My friend's NY strip seemed a bit closer to medium rare, but again, way more on the medium side.  Just disappointing.",

My first advice on the Downtown Grand - don't bother.   We were also disappointed to find out that while the hotel's website says the Triple George is their nice restaurant, it is actually across the street, and not part of the hotel.  Restaurant was good, but nothing special, and not something I think we would return to..  Prices were very reasonable for what we had.  Certainly nothing negative by any stretch, just nothing special enough to make us go back downtown.

We were passed up a number of times while we sat at the bar... no drink menus, no eye contact, nothing.  Eventually we were able to put in an order for a blackberry martini and a beer.  Waited another 10 minutes before our order-taker returned to ask if we wanted a menu. I reminded him we were still waiting on our drinks and informed him we were waiting on a table in the dining room.  Finally got our drinks and a minute later we were told our table was ready.  Unfortunately we had to settle up the bill for the bar before we could continue to the dining room.  Odd they wouldn't just transfer it over.  Dining room was a much nicer atmosphere.  I finally felt like they wanted me there, wanted to wait on me, wanted me to have a nice experience.  Waiter quickly took our order of Porcini Crusted Ribeye, an herb-butter Ribeye, and a ceasar salad.  We were in the mood for steaks!  Anyway, food was brought out quickly and tasted really great.  My husband liked my ribeye more than his so we ended up sharing.  In my opinion ribeyes don't really need much seasoning, so the porcini crusted ribeye wasn't doing it for either of us, but it wasn't bad.  Ordered a couple more drinks midway through the dinner and all was good.  I have to say that the blackberry martini is really frickin good.  Overall this place is nice and has some good food.",

Yes, not all of our group showed up on time. I think at most they were 15 mins late but to be pushed an hour because of this doesn't make sense to me. Myself and my best friend got there first and checked in. We couldn't be seated so we went to the bar and grabbed a drink. The bartenders were really nice. More that one came over and asked how we were doing and what we were in town for, a star goes to you guys. We ended up getting seated a little after 8pm for our 7pm reservation. The waiter was really nice and got our next drink orders going. They put out some sourdough bread with soft butter with oil and vinegar. I liked that. We check out the menu and thought about what to order. The waiter went over the specials and I just went with a Cesar salad. The group also order crab cakes, spinach dip, and brushetta. I really liked the brushetta I just think it should have been cut. Otherwise the dinner took a while to come out but there was a lot of us. My salad was huge, another star. I actually counldn't finish it. My friend got steak but it was a little over cooked but tasted good. Something I also thought was weird was they didn't have redbull but a knockoff that I can't remember the name of. It tasted similar but just odd for the place. Our friends made a cake and they were nice enough to let us bring it, another star to that. Overall the best part was the bread, brushetta, and the cake my friend brought. I want to go back and order something different and hopefully my whole group will show up on time.",

We finally asked that our meal to just be boxed up and for the check so we could leave and the server came saying she made \"an executive decision\" and placed our plated food on the table.   Overall I was not impressed with the manager's response to a disappointing night, the continued lack of service after speaking with the manager, or the \"executive decision\" by our server which went entirely against our request. I sincerely hope this is a one-off for Triple George.",

    "text": "My sister and I just finished a cross country road trip and our last stop before we hit our destination of Santa Barbara, California was Las Vegas.  We were absolutely exhausted and needed something delicious and filling after all the driving we had done.  Based on some Yelp reviews (as well as their great deal where we could get money off of an entree!), we picked this place and I am very happy we did.  First of all the place is right next to the Fremont Street Experience, so after you eat, you can walk up and down that historic promenade, hit up some bars, watch some street performers, its a great time!  But if you're not into the shall-we-say eclectic personages that visit and perform at Fremont Street, Triple George grill is enough of its own thing to not have to worry about it.  The place is HUGE even though they don't look like they are from the outside.  Definitely feels like a great happy hour spot, based on the great cocktails and the size of the bar.  I started with a blackberry martini and, even though I'm not usually a vodka girl, I had three of them!  For our meals my sister ordered the special, a steak with crab stuffed, fried shrimp, and I had the cioppino.  My sister's dish for sure left something to be desired.  The steak was slightly overcooked, she ordered it medium rare.  It should have been the star of the dish, though the stuffed shrimp were tasty.  My cioppino, on the other hand, was addiction worthy.  I am the biggest garlic fan you will ever find and the broth was LOADED with it, not to mention the garlic sourdough wedges on the side.  Thank GOD we had extra bread on the table, otherwise I would have had to lick the bowl.  The seafood was all cooked excellently.  I would come back to this place just for the broth and the bread!",

For dinner he had the filet mignon and I had the INCREDIBLE Crab Stuffed Shrimp. I am not a fan of zucchini in any form, but paired with the Shrimp and Rice Pilaf...I enjoyed every ounce of my dinner, chewing slowly to savor the flavors.   The real champion at Triple George was Becky our beautiful server. She suggested Creme Brulee for dessert and upon learning about my birthday, added a \"Birthday Flare\" to my decadent dessert and suggested the house red to pair with it.   Best dining experience I've have since moving here. A new Vegas favorite.",

Service was wonderful. The bread and butter/oil was very fresh and tasty. Calamari app was very good, or so I was told, I didn't eat any. Clam Chowder was described as interesting and good with a lot of clams. Meat Loaf dinner with mashed potatoes also very good, the loaf was wrapped with bacon so how could you go wrong? Regular Rib-Eye steak (36.95) was tender and cooked perfect but really lacked any flavor. It was good but nothing outstanding. Price was pretty good, table of 3 for 100.00 including the tip. I don't know if I would come back but I would recommend it to others if they were in the area.",

The waiters/bartenders are all in suits, they specialize in fresh steak/seafood, they have an outstanding lunch, dinner, drink, AND dessert menu.  The food is incredible. The price is a bit much, but this is no ordinary restaurant/bar. You may dress up on date night here and order a bottle of wine or a classy signature cocktail...something I never do. There are coat racks/purse hooks everywhere and the booths are very enclosed and personal. The inside almost reminds me of a speakeasy. ;) Be back later.",

Then the food served to the table was cold. Manager again said did you tell server that would have been a good thing to do if she had come back to the table before we complained. And please don't make a reservation cause they will charge for the people that did not show up. So I would say this would not be a place to go if you want a good hot meal and service that cares.",

Ordered drinks- mojito was not muddled- so we sent it back- only to receive another non muddled mojito. Our waiter was obviously extremely frustrated- with the slow kitchen or something. After over an hour an a half we received our food. We received an extremely burnt pot pie- sent it back and it was taking way too long so we cancelled the order. Broccoli with the $65 steak and lobster was ice cold. Sad to say we will never go back here, and the birthday celebration night was pretty much ruined.",

The pot roast is tender beef with a lovely gravy and mashed potatoes. We were so impressed with the sophisticated simplicity of this dish - we tried to duplicate it at home. Ahhh - we tried.   The wings - a nice heat with a sweet note at the end. These are a nice twist on an American classic.

    "text": "We had the most wonderful experience and food at Triple George Grill. We called down and asked if they could fit eight of us in around 8:30 on a Friday night and by the time we walked down (15 minutes) they had a table set up for our party. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter, Victor(best ever), was very attentive and fun, fun, fun! He gave us the menu run down and was very knowledgeable on each item we asked about. We also had a server(bus man) named Leo who was friendly and quick with any extras we requested and filling our waters. Now, on to the food-DELICIOUS! The portions were huge, seriously enough for people to share. When we sat down the brought relish trays and sourdough bread that was amazing. Three people ordered the huge Porter House steak special and one ordered the fillet from the menu, All of them were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms on the top were a great accent. We also had the veggies and the whole plate was cooked to perfection. The chicken dish with proschuto(sp) was Devinne, the chicken pot pie was enormous and a little heavy on the sage. I liked it, but my friend that ordered it isn't a huge sage fan:(. We had the ravioli dish which was exceptional and the Halibut w/shrimp. With the exception of the sage heavy chicken pot pie, our evening at George's was phenomenal! Again, Vince made our dining experience fun and exciting, he was SPECTACULAR! I don't know when we'll head back to Vegas, but George's will be on our schedule.",

    "text": "Old school Vegas at its best. The Triple George Grill is nicely hidden away from the strip and behind the old downtown area of Vegas. Mostly a locals place it was great to get to experiance the Triple george as a out of towner. The old style of the resturant brings back the days of Frank Sinatra and the rat pack days of vegas. From the large all wood bar to all the other wood work in the resturant this place brings back the good old days. The service here is top notch and a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the strip. For an appitiser we had the goat cheese. The goat cheese was cooked to prefection and the garlic toast that was served with it was very tasty. For dinner I had the Filet. The steak was cooked a bit rare for me. I ordered it Medium, but was very tastly. The portion size was also nice and large. The steak fries here were different than other I have had but were also quite good. Be prepaired to eat when you come here because the portions are large.",

My only complaint is that I asked them if they had an automatic gratuity for large parties, and they said no, but then charged us one, anyway.  Not a big complaint as that is pretty much standard.",

We were acknowledged by wait staff immediately, and brought water and bread.  We ordered Kir Royales, and our server had no idea what they were, which was surprising.  I have had them before in TG.  But fortunately bartender knew what he was doing.  We shared steamed clams for appetizer (broth was to die for), shared a caprese salad (didn't have enough balsamic or basil for my taste, but tomatoes were ripe, big and delicious).  BF had the porcini crusted ribeye and baked potato.  Both were HUGE, and he ate as much as he could.  Almost finished the steak and some of the potato, and he is usually a big eater.  But he thought the steak was delicious. I had Dover sole with mashed potatoes.  The sole was a whole fish (small) and was deboned and filleted at the table.  Delicious and the potatoes were perfect.  Too full for dessert.  We told the waiter that we wanted the service to be leisurely, so while he checked on us regularly, didn't put in each course order until we said we were ready.  Service by CJ was terrific, altho he started off a little stand-offish, but we were old friends by the time we left.  Another great evening at Triple George.",

Greeted warmly when I walked in the bar I sat at the long dark wood bar...the kind you still see only in the old city bars back east. Service was friendly, .The complimentary bread was fresh and hot. I ordered the baked cod...it was seasoned perfectly and served with a lemon butter sauce tht was so thick it could have been mistaken for gravy on biscuits and gravy.( this is a good thing) It was served on the side and complimented the dish perfectly. The serving portion was larger than average as well. This isn't a stop if you are looking for a cheap place, but the prices aren't out of line with mid-upscale places anywhere else. I really liked my experience here and will return next time i'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I like that this restaurant is close to where I was staying on Fremont St.  My friend and I came here for a late dinner, so the restaurant was mostly empty.  There is more privacy at this restaurant, as each table was partitioned from the other tables with wood panels.  I like that.  Funny thing, though is that some guy stopped at our table by accident and was surprised that it's not his. Then a few minutes later, another guy did the same thing.  Guess it's hard to tell which is your table when you can't see the people sitting there.    For appetizers, we had the seared ahi and crab cakes. I thought both dishes were very tasty. The ahi was topped with what tastes like horseradish. I thought that was an excellent seasoning.  The vegetables that came with it were delicious!  It was perfectly flavored, as opposed to the typical steamed and bland veggies of other places.  The crab cake was good, but nothing spectacular.  I had the vegan burger as the main course. It was, at best, just average. The burger consisted of a veggie pattie and arugula, nothing else. Now, I'm usually ok with arugula, but this time, there was a smell to it that I didn't like, so it was hard for me to finish it. I tried to mask the smell with catsup, but it didn't work out too well.  I should have probably known better than to order a burger at a steak and seafood place.   Our waitress was something else. She's originally from San Diego, and boy, is she ever the horrible actress!  Her overly excited voice and exaggerated acting were quite entertaining as she rattled off the specials of the day. I think she lost me right when she started talking. I was distracted by her expression and overacting.  She seems to enjoy her job.    Overall, I thought the appetizers were good, but the vegan burger, you can skip.  The waitress was entertaining, but I think I can only handle her in smaller doses.",

They offered a three course meal themed around Shrek which my girlfriend got and really enjoyed particularly the goat cheese salad.

My last experience with fish and chips was in Ireland and these certainly stood up to those delicious treats. For dessert I went with the creme brulee which was a perfect consistency and I would order that again for sure. The waitress was prompt and made sure we got out with plenty of time to get to our show.  The only draw back to this location is that it is valet only and not a very large valet so if you aren't doing an early dinner you might want to park at one of the surrounding hotels.",

    "text": "I have never been to the Triple George for dinner, but as far as lunch goes: NOWHERE downtown beats the food, service, and consistency of this place. NOWHERE. Not even the new places that have popped up (like Eat, etc.).   I work less than a couple of miles from here and frequent TG whenever clients or coworkers or even friends/family feel like meeting me for a lunch that is a bit more \"classy\" than most spots. And for the price and various lunch specials, you really cannot do any  better!  I've ordered or tasted just about everything on the menu because I've been so many times. Today, I met my mom and grandmother for lunch and ordered a cup of french onion soup and a blackened salmon caesar salad. My grandmother had a TG club sandwich (turkey and roast beef on marble rye) served with coleslaw and my mother had a big bowl of the special minestrone soup.   First of all, the service is always impeccable. Even when busy, I have never had any issues with receiving assistance ordering or getting refills/orders taken immediately. Also, their sourdough bread is TO DIE FOR. Served so fresh and warm that it almost melts in your mouth!  My french onion soup was actually quite delicious and flavorful (and I just had authentic FO soup in Paris last week, so I'm definitely not easy to impress) and a perfect portion before my salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly and lightly seasoned, just the way I like it. The salad wasn't too impressive - just lettuce and a few crumbles of croutons, but it was caesar, so I wasn't expecting much more.   I didn't taste my mother's or grandmother's, but they gobbled everything up like it was their last supper!   Aside from the food, the ambiance and atmosphere are also wonderful. Rustic wooden walls and decor with vintage-Vegas pictures and a slightly dim lighting. Fantastic!   Here are a few of my menu favorites:  Any and all of the caprese salads/specials (they have had crab, filet, swordfish, etc.) Seared Ahi Downtown Wings The Wedge NY Steak Sandwich Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken Porcini Ravioli BLT (also, their shoe string fries are super tasty!)",

All restaurants need to do is take some basic steps to ensure no gluten is used in the recipe, or that there is no cross contamination while they prepare a dish for me.  Update:  On my next visit I ordered the exact same dish and double-double-checked with the server, who tripled checked with the kitchen, but I *still* got sick the following day. Disappointing. If I do go back I'll certainly not eat the salmon again (even though it was DELICIOUS).  As long as you don't have any special dietary requirements, then this is a great place to go.",

The atmosphere is dark with a long wood bar -- exactly the type of decor you'd expect in a classic \"old boys network\" bar.  If you want to have a martini in a suit--this is one of the few formal places in Vegas that might fit the bill.  There are very few t-shirts and shorts here.  Call it the Vegas professional's happy hour bar.  Beyond the professional drinking spot, Triple George offers a nice classic steakhouse menu.  They offer numerous lunch specials, ranging from some creative salads to classic chicken and steak sandwiches.  For dinner, the place is a little more like a classic steakhouse (oysters, salads, steaks, and mashed potato options).    Basically, it's a classic American bistro restaurant and one of the more formal atmospheres in Vegas.  Thumbs up.",

I know that may not be overly descriptive, but it tasted like it was mass produced or like what you find in a hospital.  Just didn't love it.  Also, I was annoyed that they refused to allow me to substitute a baked potato for the rice.  So, not only did I buy a baked potato after paying for an overpriced meal, but it was covered in salt & I despise salt.  In short, would not return.",

    "text": "My date and I came here for New Year's Eve dinner. I called other steakhouses downtown around 4pm and everywhere was already booked. I called the Triple George and I was able to make a reservation for 9pm. We got seated and we were served just a pre fixe and drink menu. My date and I looked at each other and were bummed that it was just pre fixe. My date had looked at their menu online before we came in, and was looking forward to trying their chicken. We discussed whether or not we should go somewhere else since it was pre fix.  We decided not to since the restaurants I called earlier were booked, and figured this is our only option. It was 4 courses for $65 a person. Each course was bland and not what we were hoping it to be. For our main course we both got filet and lobster that came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both of our meals were very bland and we needed to use a lot of salt to give it any flavor. We preceded to eat it anyways because it was a pre fixe, and it's not like we had any other options. As we're finishing our meal we hear the table next to us ordering from the regular menu. When we hear this then we become really disappointed. So not were our meals less than average, and more money than the other food we were looking forward to having, but we find out the whole menu, was in fact available. Our server asks us how everything was and my date expressed his disappointment in the meal and she sent a manager over. The manager was even more disappointing than the food. All he did was apologize and almost insult us by continuing to say he wishes we would have said something while we were eating. It was insulting because he gave the impression that he thought we were saying something just to get something for free. We then told him that we were only served a pre fixe menu and didn't say anything because we were under the impression that our meal was our only option. It wasn't until we were done that we found out that, that wasn't the case. We weren't looking to have our meal fully comped or anything by any means, but he could have offered to discount it a little or offer us a round of drinks due to the lack of service for not receiving a full menu, and the less than impressive dinner. Instead all he did was continue to say he wishes we would have said something sooner and that he's sure we'd get better service next time. Next time? No, thank you. With the disappointing service, disappointing food, and disappointing management there won't be a next time.",

What a damn tragedy that I've been missing out on this here joint for 6 years.   Enjoyed this place last night before heading down to lend an ear to Rise Against. Awesome.  Really awesome food.  Service was okay.  They were busy but the waiter was super nice.   We had -   Their sourdough bread with their pepper flake olive oil.  I am the biggest sucker for some good bread.  I would eat it by itself for dinner if it was healthy for me.  So damn good.  Blue cheese wedge - not as big as the waiter had claimed but the dressing was very tasty.  Lamb chops - cooked more rare than medium rare. Which was perfect regardless because it was perfect.  From the flavor to the mashed potatoes; some of the best lamb I've had.  Seafood fettuccine - a little spice and the scallops were OH so delightful.  The sauce was super buttery and thick. So beware, but it was full of flavor.   Come here if you haven't been to this place.  And hopefully it shows up on people's feed.  Worth every penny.  And they play sports for you crazy sports fanatics.",

    "text": "Went to my mom's house to visit the fam one Monday night and my brother invited me to dinner with his friends in DTLV.  I was excited to try this spot as Downtown has so many up-and-coming spots --- it's always exciting to try new things there.  Yelped \"Triple George\" and was surprised that there were reviews from 2010 --- I'm in Downtown enough to \"THINK\" I know where things are but, I stand corrected.  We drove on a street (next to the Grand Hotel) and were really surprised to see that particular street had outdoor seating for the various restaurants there. My sister-in-law said it reminded her of Gaslamp District in San Diego; to which we all agreed.  The restaurant was fairly busy with business-dressed people, as well, as families....like us (10 ppl, including 4 kids).   We started with a bottle of pinot noir, goat cheese marinara, and calamari. The goat cheese marinara was what it sounds like but, tastes sooooooooooooooooooooo amazing!!!!!!!! Goat cheese was baked/warmed with the marinara and some olive oil to which we spread upon some bread/baguette. UGH......did I say it tasted sooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and creamy. I love cheese and pizza and bread so, this was the best of my three worlds.  I've always wanted to try veal so, I figured this would be my chance...and got veal scaloppini. ***let it be noted that I'm disappointed that they didn't have lamb***  The sauce with the mushrooms and brown gravy was exactly how I imagined being rich and full of flavor. The meat was sliced thin and thoroughly cooked through. The side of veggies it came with went really well with the dish...like what you would expect at a steakhouse.  My sister in law loved her burger and asked for more lettuce as she at it without the bun ....\"protein style...\"  My brother and all his friends got the ribeye. They seemed to love it but, portions were too much for brother, so he packed it for his morning \"steak and eggs.\" Ironically, the stand out dish for me/my sis-in-law was the French onion soup that my niece had for dinner. It was so hearty, cheesy, and so savory!   We weren't going to order dessert as we were all full but, the kids wanted to samps the chocolate cake and pumpkin spice cheesecake. I looooooooooooooove chocolate but, that pumpkin spice cheesecake was stellar!",

It was beautiful, but very rare and I gagged on it...can't eat anything bloody.  Again the manager came and actually got us another. It came in five minutes...so you can guess how it was cooked.  We decided to take it home and cook it there.  They were pleasant and the rest of the food was great, and our friends ordered off the special and were very pleased.  I was very upset!",

    "text": "An oldie and a classic, Triple George Grill was everything I wanted and expected it to be. I ordered the spicy shrimp and scallop linguine without the shellfish and substituted for chicken instead (yes, because I am pedestrian and basic and because I wanted to make sure it was enough food for me, because appetite).   The creole cream sauce was just the right amount of spicy, the chicken was well seasoned, and everyone else seemed to love their dishes as well. A couple of my friends had the fried chicken and they all said it was smashing (that's not the word they used but they did drool over it so shoot me). One of them said it was \"crazy good\". The other said it was \"the bombiggity\" - all good things, apparently.   The loud motorcycles parked out front were also entertaining. Some of them were loud and annoying and you wanted to throw your steak knife at them, but most of them tried to be quiet when pulling out of the spots. A couple wanted to show off but it's all part of the experience, and nothing the restaurant needs to worry about.   Just being able to sit outside on a nice hot evening and have dinner with a bunch of seemingly normal people was just a nice change from the usual asinine behavior of the strip.",

    "text": "The food and beverages here were outstanding and our server was fine.  My husband ordered the surf and turf special and I ordered the fried chicken.  We each had a drink and requested LOTS of water as the evening wore on.   I also ordered a side of fresh asparagus (a favorite) which was definitely the only downside to the food overall.  If you are familiar with asparagus, you know that the thicker it is, the more woody the texture and the less flavorful it is - this was about a half-inch thick at the bottom of each of the six stalks on my plate.  We had requested a booth with our reservations, not knowing what the chairs were like in the restaurant.  I have mobility issues that makes sitting in wooden chairs very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, the restaurant was out of booths so they seated us at a table but the chairs were well cushioned and worked just fine.  The biggest downside to this restaurant is the air conditioning, or lack thereof I should say.  I have started suffering randomly from hot flashes and so initially I thought the temperature in the room was my internal temperature going haywire again until my husband started to blot the sweat off his brow.  We questioned the waitress on the temperature and she was apologetic but said it happens every time the room is semi-full, which it was.  By the time our meals arrived I was sweating so much that I just could not fully enjoy the meal.  With it being late evening and the temperature outside dropping closer to 100 degrees we opted to skip desert and an after dinner cocktail in order to feel the breeze outside the restaurant.    I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant in the winter - once the daytime temperatures in the city drop below the need for air conditioning.  I would recommend you go a couple doors down and grab a pizza in the summer - where you can take it back to your hotel room where the temperature is exactly as cool as you want it to be.",

    "text": "Experience:  Came with a large group of folks to try this spot out. It was a Thursday at 1:00.   Facility: This was a very nice restaurant. It had almost an old speakeasy feel with the fine wood accents. The atmosphere is a tad upscale. I did feel a little underdressed since I was in jeans, but it was the lunch crowd, so I didn't stand out too bad. They had a large bar in the main area too, that looked like a nice place to grab some drinks. There was also outside seating, which would have been awesome because the weather was gorgeous.   Service:  The service over all was very good. The waiter had a good disposition, and was patient with our large, some of them picky, group. However, I did explain that I needed a lot of water (I was nursing a hangover) and keep the refills coming, yet my glass was empty often, and I had to ask for a few refills.   Food: There were some neat things about this place, but overall the food was...meh.  The served hot bread 4/5 on the table that was good, but some herbed butter on the side.  The ice tea 5/5 was pretty awesome because they bring out a glass full of ice cubes made of actual tea. Then they add the liquid tea on top. Great idea!!!!!! I ordered the fish and chips 2.5/5 after another review on here raved about it. I wasn't as impressed. The fish was ok...a tad bland. It was beer battered, but had a storage aftertaste I couldn't place. The fries 4/5 were hot and pretty decent. The Coke slaw 4/5 surprisingly had a nice twang to it. I would not order the fish again.   Overall: it was just ok.  Great atmosphere, but the food was lacking. The person next to me ordered a steak, and it looked great and was cooked perfect. Maybe I'll try that if I ever come back.",

Anyway I found Triple George had a Happy Hour and I went to check it out. It's a block from Fremont hotel. I had never been to that part of town (across from downtown grand and near Hogs and Hefers/Pizza Rock) anyway, there I was. I sat at the bar, even tho outside would probably be more fun (if weather was a little warmer and not being solo) but I'm comfortable at the bar and ordered 2 beers and chicken parm sliders for $11.92. Now we're talking. The sliders were absolutely delicious and I'll definitely like to have them again. I didn't want to overeat so it was sorta perfect. Nice atmosphere inside. Looked like there was a nice dining area inside too.",

The server barely came around and if it wasn't for the sweet girl refilling our drinks we would probably just walked out.   My boyfriend ordered their steak and lobster special $65.00 and I ordered a steak with potatoes and a side of asparagus. The food comes out and my boyfriends steak looked like, and I quote him, \"something from sizzler\" it was thin and colorless. So he asked to order a different steak and waited 20 minutes for it. My food was fine, but the steak had very little flavor, the potatoes were good.   Server never came to see if the new steak was ok, and no manager either. Check comes and not only do they not do anything to compensate for his ridiculous steak... But they CHARGED HIM for the new one!   NO NO NO! This place was too pricy for that crap!   The only good service was the girl refilling our drinks and the busboy who really took care of our table keeping it nice.   Won't be back. Too many good food choices all over to be treated like that. Sucks because we live here and my boyfriend lives right up the street.",

The bartender was amazing! She was making drinks and taking complicated orders at the same time! She also talked me into a completely different drink than what I ordered because she thought it might be too sweet for me. She was right! I loved the drink she suggested, it was a martini of some sort.  Once we sat down, the great service continued! The food was really amazing as well. We got an order of baked goat cheese marinara for the table. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening. I ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer as part of my meal. It was good. The shrimp was nice and cold and the cocktail sauce was tasty. I also ordered a cup of the soup of the day, which was a vegetable beef soup. It was also tasty, with big chunks of beef.",

    "text": "A group of us came here for dinner after seeing The Nutcracker at Smith Center (which was really good.)  It was my first time here but everyone else, being Vegas residents, were very familiar with this place.  The ambience was very nice, sort of an old school/new school mix and the service was top notch.  I passed on an app but there were some salads and soups ordered by the others.  They all said they were good.  For dinner I ordered the 16oz. Ribeye with a side of sauteed mushrooms.  The cut was a good balance of fat to meat, pretty tender and cooked just as I ordered..mid-rare.  One thing I do have to say is that the meat was seasoned aggressively, which is just how I like my steaks.  It seemed like just salt and pepper but it was taken right to that edge of being too salty but not stepping over that line...flavorful and perfect.  We all passed on desserts but one bread pudding did go home with one of us...unfortunately it wasn't me, i was too stuffed from all that steak and mushrooms to jam any more into mah belly.  One funny thing on the way back to the car, we walked over to Fremont Street to see the huge Christmas tree all lit up.  There was a huge crowd there as expected and in the middle of it all, there was a girl, in just a G-string and some pasties with a boom box dancing for tips.  It was in the upper 30s that evening...gotta love Vegas...hah.",

    "text": "I came here specifically because I was in the mood for seafood pasta. The waiters were extremely professional. The menu seamed a bit pricey to me only because entrees don't come with sides so an entree and a side together already put one person at $40. This is not an issue, just wasn't expecting the pricey-ness. The food tasted very good and well seasoned!! The pasta I order was spicy and very delicious I think it was a shrimp and scallion linguine in a creole cream sauce. Very delicious. The ceasar salad was very small for $8 it was about 1 cup of salad. However, the dressing tasted like buttermilk, as if the dressing was hand-made (made from scratch) I appreciate that culinary delight.  Here is why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5-star review. Their clam chowder had no clams in it. The particle of clam I perceived within the soup was the literally the size of a grain of rice. I kid you not, it was literally that small and maybe 5 pieces that same size in there. That's not a clam chowder soup, that's more like \"clam remnant\" soup. I didn't appreciate that at all. Didn't really care for the compliment bread either I think they used sourdough bread ...I wasn't satisfied with that. A traditional dinner roll or bread without that sour taste is a much better option. The entree portion size was s bit small too.  All in all I would still go back their again. The entrees are the best part of the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone :)",

    "text": "Craving a nice steak dinner for Thanksgiving with a coworker, we decided on coming back to triple George, it's been a while since we've been here.  We had made reservations and were promptly seated and shortly after met up with our waiter, Ryan.  Nice guy, drinks were ordered and arrived quickly. They had a special Thanksgiving menu which my coworker ordered from, I chose the regular menu and I noticed some changes.  The steaks looked appealing but the side choices to order from looked dismal.   The choices were roasted asparagus, or mixed mushrooms, French fries etc., I was hoping for something a little along the lines of Mac n cheese, or a \"gratin\" of some sort, maybe grilled veggies...  I ended up ordering two appetizers as my \"sides\" instead, the spinach & artichoke dip is really good, served with toasts.  I also would recommend the short rib ravioli, delicious!  My rib eye arrived perfectly rare and seasoned, the carrot and broccoli, unfortunately was a bit cold, I only ate the carrots, and the fries were just fries.  My coworker like her prime rib and deviled eggs. Apple pie was good too.  The customer service here is very good, everyone was friendly and pleasant.   I did show the hostess my Triple George 15% discount from their Yelp page and asked if I could use it, she said \"no\".  In customer service, you should never use the word \"No.\" especially since it's their own promo and there are no restrictions.  Overall, it didn't ruin my holiday, I had a pleasant time.   I live in downtown Fremont and I often will suggest a couple of other steak houses first.  Let's see if I return here and their \"Good\" service becomes \"Excellent\" then, I can add them to my list of recommended steak houses to others.  :)",

They called me the day before to confirm.   We walk in early but, we were still seated right away. She hands us the Valentine's Day menu. We didn't get a regular menu like everyone else. On the Valentine's Day menu, there are 4 courses for $99 a couple. For the first 2, each person can pick what you want out of 2 choices. And for the entree and dessert, you shared.   First course: truffle salad or a red pepper bisque. We got one of each. Duh. The dressing on the salad was tasty. The bisque was also tasty. They made a heart with cream. The garlic bread in the soup was a nice little touch.   Second course: beef Wellington or scallops. Again, we got one of each. The beef Wellington was good but, there wasn't much beef. The sauce that came with it was good. It has mushrooms in there. The scallop came out on top and potato Latka. The scallop was cooked well but, the sauce it came with was underwhelming. The potato was alright as well.   Entree: the choices were tomahawk, surf and turf, or duck. We went with the surf and turf cooked medium rare. When the server described the menu, she made it seem like they were going to split the food for us. We got it on one plate and they gave us a plate to split ourselves. The 9oz filet was on top of mashed potatoes and 3 asparagus. It had 4 grilled shrimp. The filet was cooked well but, it was quite bland and dry. We asked for a side of their bernaise sauce. Once we got the sauce, it was good. The shrimp was over cooked by a bit.   Dessert: some pear thing and chocolate souffle. We went with the chocolate. I am not sure I have had a souffle before but, my bf has. I do watch a lot of food network so I can tell the consistency was wrong. My boyfriend said the flavor is right, the consistency was off. The vanilla ice cream that came on top was good.   Oh, I ordered a dirty martini and my boyfriend got a coke. The drinks basically came out after our food did. When we first sat, a guy came by and poured us some water. He spoke once. Asked if regular water was ok or if we wanted bottled water. When he did come by to fill the water and I would say thank you, he didn't respond. Uhh I almost said you're welcome for him. I controlled myself. Anyways, he also dropped off bread and butter. The butter was soft and it sat in Italian dressing? That's what it tasted like. We were one of the first ones in that part of the dining area but, it filled up quickly. The restaurant itself is a cute little place. There seems to be a lot of locals there.   Overall, it was a good meal. Perfect portions. Service was a little slow. It was a good price for the food we got. Oh, no big deal but, FYI we were charged $3 for the bernaise. It was worth it for the filet though.",

The crowd was small - I was the only one sitting out side - I just wanted catsup for my fries - no luck...maybe it's cause I am just a tourist and think I won't be back - well, I travel to Vegas often...and I won't be...if you are gonna gouge folks - at least provide the right service. Then the rude guy, wanders out and drops my $42.11 bill on the table - like I was an inconvenience- I tip well usually- but treat me like this - nope.  I was contacted by the on duty manager after I had posted my review, as well as the GM, via Yelp, very professional and sincere in their response. They assured me that the issue has been dealt with...professional service such as this would encourage me to give them a second chance.",

    "text": "I had been to Triple George once before many years ago and went back to use an OpenTable awards certificate.  I was seated immediately off the bar area in a room that cut off much of the noise from the happy hour crowd at the bar.  I was soon brought a small basket of house sourdough bread and two rounds of soft butter with spiced oil and vinegar--more vinegar that oil.  It was OK but the spices didn't add to the flavor that much.  I do appreciate soft butter like this that hasn't been just taken out of a sub-zero freezer and you have to use and ice pick to separate it and try to spread it on your bread.  I was brought iced tea quickly and a glass of water although not requested.  The server had a few specials to go over with me and then he let me look over the menu to decide.  When he returned, I ordered the kurobuta squash soup--the soup of the day--and the 14 ounce strip steak with bone on ordered blue.  I had a choice of mashed or rice and I went with the mashed.  When the soup was brought, he brought the pepper mill and ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The soup was good.  Nice chunks of squash rather than having it blended into a puree.    The steak came at a proper interval from the time I finished my soup--read, I had enough time to check Facebook and have another piece of bread.  The steak was cooked the way I wanted.  It had char on both sides but was very rare on the inside, just the way I like my steak.  I wish I had a choice of a baked potato or fries instead of mashed or rice.  Steak and mashed potato doesn't make it as well in my book.  The small amount of vegetables was just perfect.  I didn't have to buy a side that would serve 3 people and left room for dessert.    I looked over the dessert menu and I went with their rumchata bread pudding.  It was very good.  The bread was soft and had a nice cinnamon flavor from the topping.  There was no taste of rum which was OK with me.  It baked away and didn't leave flavor behind.  Service was very good.  My server was attentive and the table was cleared of dishes between courses quickly.  Triple George is close to a 4 star but I'd like to have more choice with the starch.",

First was medium to mid well, second was rare (think seared ahi steak).  We just ate it at that point but it was obviously not correct temp.  Also, there was no crust/sear on these steaks.  They were also super thin, I thought it was a pork chop when i saw it -- this was a 16oz bone in new york!  We also had a lobster tail with the steak.  Because they had to re-fire the steak, the tail just got cold and lifeless.  The idea of a surf and turf is that you're eating both, some of this, some that.  They prob should've refired that as well or compd it.  I mentioned their wine list previously -- it's the same with only horrendous options by the glass.  Nothing old world, juts a bunch of cheap mass produced CA cabs etc.  Even the full wine menu (by the bottle) is hardly any better.  To top it off, waiter takes check after I sign and tip.  And yes, I left him 20% but still, it's so tacky to take the signed check before we have left.  I won't be back here, sorry guys, it was a good run.",

Online they have a gluten menu, but it doesn't say anywhere that it's only served at lunch so when I went in there for happy hour/dinner knowing what I wanted, it wasn't an option which was sad.

We had to wait about 20 min for the ginger beer to get there since they were out. But we didn't mind the wait.   They have a large extensive menu. It's Full of different cuts of expensive meats and seafood. However, what brought us to this hidden gem was the vegan/gluten free menu. We ordered the cauliflower rice and the roasted vegetable dish. It was awesome. The cauliflower rice was better than anything I've ever had anywhere else. So delicious. They do not offer vegan dessert, but my friend ordered the rumchata cake. He said it was really sweet, but it was good.   Everything was decently priced and portions were large. The service was friendly and they offer a vegan menu with a limited, but decent selection. I'll definitely be back.",

Triple George, though located in the middle of downtown, maintains a non-bro atmosphere with it's sleek booths and classy wooden bar. I love feeling like I am an important business person while dining here.  I've been here a few times, and every time I get amazing service. Everyone actually seems happy to work here. I often eat at the bar, read a book, and enjoy a glass of wine. Service is attentive, and I feel like I can sit back and relax without feeling rushed.  In the past I've had amazing petite fillet mignon. This time tried the buttermilk chicken. Curious as to how well a dish like that holds up at a steak house, I was not disappointed. The chicken was moist and the breading was crispy and juicy. This dish probably isn't the greatest if you are on a diet, but why diet? Gravy covers the rich mashed potatoes and chicken, and a side of veggies is added in to make you feel like you've eaten healthy for the night.",

Lots of five star reviews so yay, this sounded great.  Used Open Table to make a reservation and on a weekend it's a must.  We got there a bit early and the hostess said they'd text us when our table was ready so we went across the street to put some money in the slots.  They texted us and off we went.  It's a very old building, lots of brick, old world charm and very noisy since the sound bounces off the walls.  Unless you want to yell, don't bother with conversation.  They are known for their steaks although they do have other things for the non-beef eaters.  Everyone said the portions were huge so we opted to just have a main course with no salad or appetizers.  Smart move unless you are sharing everything.  The server started by bringing warm bread with butter and a little seasoned oil. Very nice.  My husband had a steak and I had lamb chops which I love and can't get often.  He said he steak was just ok although it was large.  Sides were a pool of mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli rabe overcooked to the point of being limp.  My chops were so tough I could hardly cut them even with a sharp knife.  I had asked for no starch and could I have an extra side of veggies.  Certainly the server said but we have to charge you unless you want extra of what we serve.  So I ordered sauteed spinach which was the high point of my meal.  My broccoli was also cooked to the point of being limp.    I've read all the reviews and keep wondering if we went to the same restaurant.  We certainly wouldn't recommend it based on our meal.",

    "text": "I came to Triple George Grill with a party of 6 and used OpenTable to secure a reservation. We we were seated on time and the restaurant was relatively quiet on a Monday evening. My family ultimately decided on Triple George because it had a vegan menu for me but still offered the steak options my dad was craving.   Our waitress was amazing, so no complaints for service here. As for the food, my beyond picky brothers shared a bowl of pasta with butter. I went with the gardein chicken stir fry. It was a little heavy on the teriyaki sauce, but other than that delicious and pretty to look at. 4/5  My dad got the pot roast and LOVED it. My mom got the bacon-wrapped meat loaf and thought it was really good, but liked the pot roast better. These meaty entrees came with mashed potatoes and veggies.   For dessert, our waitress brought out a free sundae for my dad's birthday. I love when restaurants do that! My mom ordered the chocolate molten cake, but wasn't too impressed. For our whole gang, the tab came to $70. Not bad IMO! I would definitely eat here again.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #17",

This is honestly one of the best dinners I've had in Las Vegas, especially after experiencing so many disappointing ones in casinos. I'm glad that I discovered Triple George Grill.  This restaurant is not located on the strip, but located 5 minutes away from Fremont. Highly recommend!",

Out comes the phone and BAM -- Yelp is launched.  We looked for steak, rated high, and in walking distance.  Top result was:  Triple George  We walked a few blocks to get there from our starting location.  It was close enough to the action, but far enough from the action to enjoy some quiet time.  We ordered food and drinks.  The steaks were great -- and when you pair that with the quantity and price -- we were really happy.  We weren't fans of all the cocktails, but some of them were awesome.  I won't ding them for this because I consider myself snobby with my drinks and we came here for food.  All in all - you will get a ton of great food.  If you get Mo as your waiter, you're set.  Enjoy.",

My wife had the spicy shrimp and scallops with a cream sauceand linguini. She asked for less spice and it was dialed back.  Bread was good and was served with a sweet butter and balsamic.  The bar has a selection of draft beers.  Service was on the mark. An enjoyable night out in a neighborhood feel spot.  The bar looks great!",

We were given a one page menu. My husband wanted to order off the big menu but I said no because I thought the kitchen was busy with the holiday and we would go with the flow. We went with the page. For our first course, he went with the soup and I went with the salad. So far, so good. For the second course we both had to choose one thing. We chose the scallops (plural). We they arrived, we were each given one lonely scallop served over a tasteless something. This is where we started laughing. For the main event we ordered the 28 oz. Tomahawk rib eye with mashed potatoes and asparagus for two. It arrived with its glorious huge bone and we were excited. We were each given a salad plate to use as our dinner plate. We asked for a larger plate. We split the steak and each took half. My husband took the tablespoons full of potato that had been smeared on the plate under the steak. Then what to do with the three asparagus spears!! You take two, no honey you take two!! We laughed some more about the skimpy servings \"for two\". After struggling to cut my portion of the steak and even a harder time chewing it, I left most of it on my plate.  Dessert was kinda okay.  We left laughing and arrived home hungry. Last night we went out for a real Valentine's Day meal with an appetizer for two, two real sized salads and two 14 oz  NY strips with mushrooms and two full side dishes all for a bit less than our dinner \"for two\" that would only feed one at Triple George. We are still laughing!!",

After reading all the reviews for this place and exploring the menu which covers everything including Steak, Seafood, burgers and comfort food like chicken pot pie I knew this was the best place for our large group with varied culinary tastes. Not only did they not disappoint, they actually exceeded my expectations! Upon arriving, we were taken through the bar area to the back dining room it was very classy, and definitely a bit on the classic side but not stuffy. The service was impeccable, the meals enjoyed by our group included the chicken saltimbocca, meatloaf, the specialty bone-in filet with shrimp, and cioppino. Every single one of us found her meals to be delicious and cooked to perfection. For seven of us the bill came out to $230 plus tip, granted only a couple of us in the group had an alcoholic beverage so that kept the bill low. It was a real pleasure, and since we come to Vegas a couple of times a year on business, I can say with great confidence that we will be back, it was definitely a group favorite. One tip, when I tried to make the reservation online it said that there were only spots available for a group at 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. but when I called they easily accommodated us at 6:30, so I suggest you do that.",

I always end up getting one of their salads with shrimp prepared blackened style. I opp for the lower calorie options because no matter what you cannot stop eating the bread! Their bread is hot and fresh and served with a butter and oily garlic sauce. I usually go a bit crazy before the meal actually arrives. Most of their salads and entree are $13-$18 so not too bad for a quick lunch. The atmosphere can be either fancy or casual with dark interior and mob inspired decor it's a great option for business/work lunches.",

The restaurant was very cozy and we were seated in a rounded booth. And for our overall dining experience let me start with this: our server was outstanding!  He was on point with every recommendation and adequately described the dishes. During the meal he was attentive and never intrusive or overbearing. For dessert he asked the chef if he would make Italian donuts for me (I had inquired about it but it wasn't on their regular menu). The chef agreed and the Italian donuts topped off an incredible meal.  The Food: I ordered the Pot Roast after I found out that people would come from all over just for the Pot Roast (as per our server). I started drinks with a Black Cherry Drop which was very good (recommend). I also had the Baked Onion Soup (French Onion Soup) and that was really good as well. The Pot Roast was heavenly and if I didn't believe that people came specifically for that dish, I was/am a firm believer now. Cooked perfectly, I enjoyed every hearty bite.   It was a great night at Triple George restaurant, so much so that I happily over tipped!   I will be going back!",

I got the Reuben sandwich which was okay, after requesting a side of mustard. Shouldn't that come with? Mustard made my meal cuz the meat was kinda dry. Fries were okay. Their garden salad was amazing, came tossed in our preferred ranch dressing. So yummy, could eat that all day. My BF ordered the French dip. Good bread but meat lacking in flavor n the au jus was hardly enticing. Nothing to it but a tinge of salt.  Complimentary bread's crust was hard n thick, you could crunch your face off eating that.  Service here is wonderful n they've good coffee. But, maybe dinner items are better here.",

    "text": "What an amazing experience! Immediately upon entering we were welcomed by a host (maybe the manager?) who made us feel so welcome. I like to emphasize on his enthusiasm, for there are times when hosts/hostesses do terrible jobs at making guests feel welcome and this was NOT one of those times. Instantly we broke into conversation with the man while he scoped the restaurant for an available table. Once he had a table for us, he walked us over to a booth that was practically enclosed completely. Such a romantic and private area to have dinner, something I really admired.  Then, he asked for my jacket so he could hang it on the coat rack inside our booth! I'm not one for fancy places that do these sorts of fancy things so I was a bit taken back, flattered, and then very willing to oblige and hand over my puffy Columbia jacket.  At this point, I felt like we were in a very classy steak house, but knew at the same time we were in a sports bar? Pretty cool feeling. Through our banter at the door with the host I mentioned I was vegan, and by the time we were sitting I had their \"glegan\" (gluten free/vegan) menu sitting in front of me. Not a huge menu, but it had enough variety for someone whose options at a steakhouse are generally limited to, well, salad. I got the penne primavera, boyfriend got a ribeye with two sides... well 4 total for him if you include the salad and sour dough (not vegan). All of our food was divine and the service was impeccable as well. All of our food and the bottle of wine we purchased brought our check to under $100!  Only sad thing was that there's no glegan dessert! Bummer, but not a deal breaker.  Will definitely be coming back soon!",

I made my reservation ahead of time we came in we were seat on time, the waiter came in took our drink orders, we noticed that they had only gave  us the holiday menu, so I inquire to see if they were serving food from there regular menu and they told me yes, they got me a menu. As look through the menu I want to order appetizers but the waiter seemed to be an a hurry so he came and asked us are u ready to order your dinner so we were shocked so we ordered our food my partner order thanksgiving food and my cousin and I opted for the regular menu. But the funny thing was that they pretty  much were out of the choices if the holiday menu when it came to the appetizers, so they brought  us the first courses if our meals such as salads, soups etc. But the main courses took 45 minutes. Finally because I looked at the waiter funny from far away he came an apologized and told us that they were behind in the kitchen honestly the restaurant was not busy at 7pm. My chicken was dried but I did complaint because I was hungry. When it came to the time of dessert they told my other half that they were out of the desserts of the holiday menu. Really who does that, who doesn't forecast there food properly for the holiday if  they are going to have a special, or if you are out of items why are u continue offering to the public.   Just my two cents.",

Triple George Grill fit the bill! Just across the street, the interior provided a nice, quiet respite from the Vegas hubbub. The tall wooden booths created a privacy we relished as we devoured our meals. He had the petit filet that he declared the best he'd ever eaten (and he's eaten a lot!) and I had the shrimp and scallop pasta dish, which they made with spicey marinara for me rather than the dairy-based sauce. The scallops were plump and succulent. The shrimp tender and moist. The sourdough bread....I must have eaten two loaves on my own it was so tasty.  Next time we're in downtown Vegas, we will be going to the Triple George Grill. Not only was the food delectable, but the service was a comfortable pace and friendly.",

Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious.  Just a little of above my comfort price range for the downtown area.

    "text": "I went to Triple George Grill last night with a bachelor party and it proved to be a great idea!  We had a reservation for 8PM for 10 people and we definitely arrived late with 12 people as opposed to 10. The restaurant was extremely accommodating and had us seated within five minutes.  The servers were quick to get both our drink and food orders. I had a Shirley Temple to drink that seemed to be more grenadine than Sprite, but that's alright! Besides, how many people order Shirley Temples that are over the age of 12 beside me anyway?  I ended up having the Ribeye ($34), which came with a choice of rice pilaf or mashed potatoes as well as a medley of vegetables, which were string beans and carrots. I asked the server if I could swap out the vegetables for mashed potatoes so I could have both rice and potatoes, but she said I would have to order it as a side and it'd be extra.   The flavor of the steak was VERY good. The menu says it's topped with garlic herb butter, but I didn't really taste it. Without any sort of sauce or rub at all, I thought the flavor was great.   The special of the evening was also a ribeye that had some sort of cajun-looking rub on it as well as a bleu-cheese sauce. Minus the sauce, it looked pretty darn good.  Looking around the table at what everybody ordered, I definitely have a lot to try in future visits. The chicken parmesan looked excellent, as well as the burger.  Our total bill for the 12 of us came out to roughly $450, which wasn't too bad considering this was a nicer place.  Definitely a great place for groups, and probably for dates too. The atmosphere is a little dark, very old-school Vegas...my kind of place! Will be back in the future for sure :)",

    "text": "This place is honestly 3 stars anywhere else in the city, so I'm giving it 3 stars, even though it sits in the heart of downtown's sucky-food district.   Long over-rated because of the total lack of edible food anywhere downtown, the Triple George does a great job defining mediocre. Mediocre food, average customer service, mediocre prices. There is nothing about this place that stands out or is unique. The Triple George has built its reputation on the slogan, \"They don't suck.\"  To be fair, they don't suck. The customer service is good. Not great, or fabulous, but definitely a solid \"good.\" Same with the food. Nothing to write home about but, again, solid and dependably good.   Triple George Grill is the place to go when you want to eat in downtown without leaving the restaurant feeling angry, hungry, or miserable. You are guaranteed a solid time, if not the best time ever. The food is almost worth the prices they charge, and is definitely worth it once you throw in the service that is at least 2 stars better than anything else downtown knows how to produce.  Overall, a decent place. Which, for their location, makes them the best restaurant for miles.",

I got the steak sandwich- the flavor was good but not great, however, a large portion (25%) of the steak inside the bun was inedible gristle and fat which should have been trimmed off before cooking. 2/5 for the steak sandwich. My companions both got steaks- they said they were tasty but not outstanding. 4/5 We got 2 appetizers- Ahi and Pretzel bites.  The Ahi was superb (5/5)- probably the best part of the meal.  The pretzel bites were a 4/5- liked the sauces that came with them. Took them with me in a takeout box- reheated them later that day however, they were not very appealing when reheated. The salads were not very good- we attributed that mostly to the dressing.  We ate some of the salads because we needed green vegetables, but had our consciences not been screaming at us to \"eat your vegetables!\"  I doubt we would have eaten more than a bite or two. 2/5 for the salads. Nice atmosphere to the place though. Thanks for the opportunity to comment.",

Most were ok but not as good as the hype.  Our last night there we headed down to Fremont Street and found this neat little restaurant over on 3rd about a block away from Fremont. (Thank you Yelp!)  They treated us like royalty!  I got the pot roast and my wife got the chicken pot pie.  Both were amazing and both were HUGE portions.  The pot roast was so tender I didn't need a knife, and the pot pie had a perfect flaky crust.  We ordered one salad to share and they put it on two plates for us.  Truly great service.  BONUS:  This place serves coke!  Yay!  Its hard to find a coke in Vegas unfortunately.",

    "text": "If you know me at all, then you'd know that I practically lived at Sidebar for the past year or two. I'm on a first name basis with everyone behind the bar there, as well as most of the folks next door at the Triple George Grill where all their delicious food comes from. Because I've been there so much, I have had the time to try almost everything on their menu, but my favorite item is always the burger. Sure the preferential treatment always sweetens the deal, but I won't even try to hold you in any suspense, this is one tasty burger.  Let me first explain that the Triple George Grill is a fantastic restaurant, I have never eaten anything bad there. And if you're looking for great service, good ambiance, and some great cocktails this is your spot. Plus it's one of the only good places to eat downtown so that doesn't hurt. I typically eat in the adjoining space, Sidebar, which has pretty cool yet maybe a bit outdated decor, is a bit louder, smoky, but all the more entertaining. The bartenders have become friends of mine, and it's gotten to the point that I can walk in there almost any time of day on any day of the week and I will know almost everyone sitting at the bar. This might make me sound like a bit of a lush, but it's kind of fun. Don't judge me, I'm here to judge burgers. The sad news regarding Sidebar is that supposedly it's getting re-branded in the next couple months to be Mob Bar to coincide with the opening of the Mob Museum in the downtown area, complete with corny 'memorabilia' and some remodeling. I'm not too happy about this and don't know what to make of it until I see the full extent of the changes.  As for the burger, it's great. It comes with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and your standard slice of onion, lettuce and tomato. You also get some well-seasoned and very tasty fries, a pickle wedge and some veggies which tend to get a bit neglected by yours truly although they are also quite good. While I have been there enough times to notice some inconsistency, the burger typically comes out medium-rare as ordered. The meat has great flavor, and is proportioned quite well with a crispy, slightly grilled bun. There is also some inconsistency to the amount of onions and mushrooms, as well as their level of cooking, but they always have great flavor. There is always a little bit of juice dripping out of the meat during the meal, but it never dries out and is great until the end. The fries are always cooked well, never over cooked and never too raw. As an option you can also get the thick-cut fries, which are almost like eating a big potato, but have the same great flavor and are always cooked perfectly.  The inconsistency definitely detracts a bit from this burger, there are nights that I am a little disappointed by the lack of pink in the meat, or the over-cooking that's been done to my onions, but more times than not it is cooked perfectly and I couldn't be happier. If you're looking for a great alternative to the strip, and haven't been to Fremont St in a long time, you should definitely make your way to Triple George or Sidebar for a good meal. After your meal don't forget to wander Fremont and gander at all the freaks and inappropriate tourists. Or is that the same thing?",

The steaks were also not cooked the way they had been requested.  We had 7 in our party but they tacked on the 18% gratuity despite the menu saying for 8 or more; we had it removed.  For the total of the bill, we were pretty disappointed.  On the good side, it is located right by Fremont St but dine away from the crowds.  The parking garage right across the street is free with validation. My niece mentioned my fiance & I were getting married that weekend and we were presented with a complimentary chocolate dessert, from the menu, which was amazing!",

The decor and atmosphere remind me of classic steak houses in Chicago or New York-- lots of small rooms, dark wood, long bars, stained glass.  Our waitress was pleasant and enhusiastic, knowing the menu well and making us feel comfortable.  I had a chopped salad (lettuce, tomato, red onion, bacon bits, blue cheese crumbles with a vinaigrette), a filet (perfectly medium rare and very tasty), rice pilaf, glazed carrots and crunchy green beans, Key lime pie for dessert, and a nice J. Lohr Syrah bottle of wine.  Prices less than the steakhouses on the Strip, and the quality is every bit as good.  Would highly recommend",

We went on a Saturday night at 7 and only had to wait about 20 min for a table for 6, our waitress was very friendly when she first greeted us and took our orders and then she pretty much disappeared and over an hour later we still had no food and had not seen her, we finally flagged her down to ask where our food was and she said something about the kitchen loosing our ticket but that it had been taken care of and should be out shortly. About 20 min later we got our food. I ordered the house salad which was a little over dressed but good and the pot roast with veggies and mashes potatoes which were delicious. One of my teammates got the pork chop with apple glaze that she really enjoyed. Another got the cobb salad which she said was very good, another got the mushroom and sun dried tomato ravioli which was just ok, and the final two split a steak which they said was good. Our waitress came with out checks and got them wrong as we were splitting but since we had been there for almost three hours we were ready to get out of there and just took care of figuring it out amongst ourselves, however she did bring us the incorrect change- one of us was short by $10- but after flagging her down again she corrected the situation. Over all the food was good, service was ok but the fact it took so long to get our food we probably would not go back again.",

It was our first trip to Vegas and we stumbled into while at Fremont Street basically because we were starving and the menu looked great. Two adults and four kids ages 9-19 and NO ONE was disappointed in their food. The atmosphere was nice and the wait stuff were wonderful.  We enjoyed the meal and the experience so much that we went back a couple of nights later for dinner and were no less pleased! In July 2013, my husband and I made another trip to vegas for business and Triple George's was the one restaurant we knew we wanted to return to. The food was superb, our waiter was knowledgable, polite, and \"Johnny on the spot\" with his service. So... I'm in town for business again and I took my co-worker there last night for dinner. ANOTHER great experience. We enjoyed happy hour at the bar with yummy mixed drinks and pleasant conversation from our young bartender (Laura, I think).  We moved to a table for a fabulous meal served to us by Cameron ( \"with a C\") who was very attentive and eager to please. He recommended the porticini (?) crusted ribeye and it was one of the best seasoned steaks I've ever had and was cooked exactly like I wanted. My friend has the shrimp George -yummy!  Four visits over three years and Triple George has always been a home run.  Great food.  Great service.",

Service was a little cold but ok, what we didn't appreciate is that the fried chicken had pork in it, and my boyfriend doesn't eat it. Not mentionned on the menu, so we told about it to our server when the bill came. Not great.  I still think the food is worth checking that place out - just beware of what you order.",

We liked the goat cheese appetizer and French onion soup was very good and super cheesy.  My party liked the Hangar steak, juicy and came with a \"pepper marmalade\" which seemed like onion strings marinated in something yummy; rib eye; hamburger was pretty huge and juicy.  Iced tea came with ice tea Ice cubes so it wouldn't get watered down.   One thing that we noticed sitting out on the front patio...Was nice and the weather was great but the biker bar next door was a little too loud at times and made the ambience a little distracting and noisy.",

We ordered cocktail named \"Perfect pear\" which contains pear brandy, egg whites and other ingredients. They tasted horrible, didn't taste the pear brandy and there were no egg white foam on top of the cocktails. We asked a bartender remake it, it came out a bit better though still disappointed us. One of my friend didn't finish the cocktail though his stomach got up set and he started puking. And now my stomach hurts so bad. I also had a same drink with my friend. I think the bartender used the old egg white to make our drinks that cause our stomachs all hurt.  I ordered medium rare steak and my steak came out medium. I asked to change it, then the steak came out medium rare but the rest of food was cold, the plate was cold, the lobster tail was cold, the side was cold.  To compare the price and the quality of foods n drinks, i don't think it worth my $165 bill.",

She was super nice and perky but she forgot a lot of our requests and had to remind her often.  I would come here again and try the happy hour instead as the drinks we had were pretty good!

No gimmicks, just an honest steakhouse doing what they do and doing it well.   I was in Vegas for a conference, and met a college pal who is local; we chose the Triple George Grill because of its reputation and its proximity to my hotel. It didn't disappoint. Our server, Andrew, was spot on with attentive service that allowed us room to chat and relax and take our time. The drinks were lovely, and the cioppino was as good as any I've had at the high end seafood houses in San francisco. The room was quiet enough for conversation but still had a lively energy that made it friendly and warm.   Keep it up Triple George!",

    "text": "Triple George is one of my favorite spots. I have dined here for dinner and enjoyed the most amazing steak. However I mostly frequent for lunch as it is near where I work. They have plenty of vegan and gluten free options which I think is so great. Recently I had the cauliflower fried \"rice\" with Gardein \"chicken\". I felt really good about myself having eaten an entire meal comprised of vegetables only. And it was delicious. I've also had the clam chowder, soup and salad lunch special, chicken and Brussels and more. They serve their iced tea with iced tea ice cubes! So when they melt, it's just more iced tea! Brilliant. They also serve you break with oil/vinegar at the beginning, which is so tasty. The look and feel of the place is old Vegas, 1940's perhaps, like you might see Frank Sinatra walk in and sit down with his fellas. Every one I've received service from is always friendly and professional. I left my sunglasses there by accident one time and they found them and kept them safe until I called later to inquire. Overall, this is one of my go to places. It's not the cheapest, but nothing about the place would make you think it should be. Recommend!",

It was the best food I've had in Vegas, ever! And I've been going there for the past 20 years. The place has a classy feel to it and it is decorated in sort of an Old Hollywood style...Art Deco. It's beautiful inside and has a cute patio for outdoor dining as well. We were seated a spacious booth near the bar. The service was awesome. We started with the clam chowder soup and it was AMAZING!!!! WOW. My only regret was that I didn't find try this place on our first day of the trip. I would have loved to come back to have a bowl of soup for lunch. It was that good! We ordered a glass of the house cabarnet and a Moscow mule, both were great. For dinner, my hubby ordered the filet and I had the blackened salmon....WOW WOW and WOW. This was a nice treat and a wonderful night out with my husband.",

Not sure we will ever go back but if we do, we will reserve one of the private booths.  First the good parts:  The service was excellent.  Cameron, our waiter was a True professional and in all ways the overall service was top notch.  Now the rest:  I can't fault any part of what we ordered.  We had two cocktails that were different and tasty.  I had the special Bloody Mary and she had another drink in a martini glass.   We shared the Georges Chopped Salad which was fair but for the price overcharged.  We shared the 16oz NY Steak with the BORDELAISE sauce.  Again, not bad but for $36.95 not so special either.  I am just amazed on how well many have rated this place.  For half the total bill I would have thought about coming back but for over $100 for dishes we shared, this place is not grand enough to make it a worthwhile option with so many other places to try.  So while we didn't have any issues, we weren't thrilled either.  I expected better.",

Moments later our server, Brenda was back with drinks in hand. We had a few recommendations from a friend so we had an idea of what we wanted but Brenda insisted we hear the specials, thank goodness she did! We ordered appetizers and within 5 minutes they were at our table (Wedge Salad and Calamari... calamari is really good, def a must try). We ordered salmon and the special (surf and turf which was a 22oz steak!!) the side veggies were average, the mash potatoes were really good! We were stuffed but Brenda convinced us to try the donuts as they were new to the menu so we got them to go, we should have eaten them there because they probably would have been better fresher- but still not bad! Overall, the food was great and probably one of the best service experiences we've gotten at a restaurant!! We will be back!",

    "text": "I only give it two stars partly because Yelp was slightly deceiving, partly because of the food. My boyfriend and I came in after spending some time watching the lights on Fremont street. I was in denim capris and a nice tank top, and he was in a nice t-shirt and tan cargo shorts,so we were not dressed sloppily, but definitely felt under dressed here. Two $ is slightly deceiving. While some meals are around $16,  there are also many around $40-$50 as well. Also, the chef chooses the side dishes to come with your entree, and to change one to a different side listed in the menu, it's $5. Not very happy with that. I ordered the fried chicken and potatoes, both were very mildly flavored, bland if you will. My boyfriend got meatloaf and potatoes, and both were bland also. Fairly disappointed. Hostess was rude, but waiter was nice.",

    "text": "We went on a mission to try some food that wasn't whipped up inside a hotel or casino and someone in our group found Triple George on line or something.   This little outpost is a block off of Fremont Street, in the DT3 construction zone behind the Fremont Hotel & Casino. I realize that doesn't sound appetizing and I was more than a little skeptical as we walked over.  All of those doubts were quickly jettisoned as soon as we walked inside. The decor has a really cool retro '30s feel to it. Classy, but not stuffy.  You won't see many tables when you walk in. That's because most of the seating is hidden behind private wood walls. You literally have your own booth tucked away out of the sight of everyone in the place. It's really, really, really cool.  Service was friendly and appropriate. I could tell that our server could very easily switch into her \"formal\" mode when necessary. With us, she was perfectly casual, yet professional. Nice.  Food? Dynamite. Truly. I was shocked at just how good everything was. Very simple, very fresh ingredients taken from local markets, according to the menu. Grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach sides were delicious. Lunchtime burgers were cooked to perfect doneness--well done for one friend, perfect medium for another.  Wedge salad was, again, simple but delicious, topped with bacon and blue cheese. The fish special rocked another friend's world real hard. I've rarely seen anyone get so excited over fish and wild rice, but Triple George managed to make that happen.  I've hit up a ton of restaurants in Las Vegas, but Triple George quickly joined my list of personal favorites.",

The food looked very appetizing. The fries were great but the rueben sandwich was very greasy, dripping with grease/butter and the bread too hard and crunchy.  Someone else at my table ordered the same thing and said the same thing about their rueben.  Others ordered the chicken sandwich and said the chicken was good but the roll too hard.  I guess they have a problem cooking bread or this is they way they make it.  I just didn't like it and don't expect this from a rueben.  The bread that came before the meal was very good;  nice and crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside.  TVs all over tuned into sports-a plus!!",

Two out of three on our last visit.  I ordered the pot roast, which I literally had to saw through with a steak knife.  Not tender at all.  Our guest had the ribeye special, which was also pretty tough and chewy.  My wife had the Chicken Saltimbocca, which she wasn't impressed with either.  However, the baked goat cheese appetizer and the calamari appetizer were both outstanding as usual.  At the end of the meal our guest was served room temperature decaf.  Not a great experience.  We'll give them another chance because this has not been our normal experience with Triple George.  But our guest was not impressed and I don't blame him.",

My girlfriend had the fettuccini alfredo and I had the porcini crusted ribeye. Possibly the best steak I've ever had, and it was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes and veggies that came on the side were also very good. Great martinis. Very nice intimate and private booths. This will be a regular stop for me from now on, when I come to Las Vegas.",
