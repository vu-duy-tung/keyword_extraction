From raw to cooked they have it.  Make it any way you want. The taro chips are really good.  I prefer soy paper over nori or tortillas. The poke sauce and creamy cilantro are a great combo. Thank you to the team for busting out that lunch rush today without a sweat!!",

Size per portion is just enough. Some might need more than 1 order.   Con: 1. Cleanliness needs some more attention. Especially on dining table. I had to ask a bottle of cleaning chemical to the cashier since the table was so dirty & I had a 2 YO daughter with us. She gave us a cleaning rag instead.   2. Lacking of basic knowledge of cleanliness/sanitation.  What concerned me the most, is that when she gave me the cleaning rag, it was passed over our food. That's a huge No No in food industry.   3. Man's restroom was not lockable. I accidentally opened the door when a kid was using it. I suggested the kid to lock the door when he uses the restroom. Yet, when I tried to lock the door, it wasn't successful.   What if there was a pedophile taking advantage on that kid since you fail to maintain the basic safety toward your patrons. God forbids on that. Restroom need to be check hourly & documented for the cleanliness, functions, & its safety.   4. Restroom was not cleaned.",

    "text": "SOHO SUSHI BURRITO is finally here!!!!   I was very excited to see that SOHO has opened up their own sushi burrito place. This is the only place like this in Vegas and it is a must try!   Located on sahara right off the I-15 freeway. Perfect location for anyone staying or working on the strip. It is very easy to find and it is right across the street from the Palace station. When I was there for lunch it did start to get a little busy so if there is a wait, it's worth it trust me!   When you first walk in, there is a wall with a collection of different articles of Chef John Lee, it was really cool to see his back ground and his journey. He clearly has a passion for food and spoiler you can taste it in the food!!   The staff is super efficient and fast, so the line will go by fast. I overheard them helping customers with questions as it is a new concept and not everyone understands how to order. When I was ordering they were always generous asking me if it was enough sauce and if I wanted more toppings.   So if you're new to the concept of sushi burrito, they are like big hand rolls or burritos that you can add sushi ingredients to. To start you can wrap your burrito with either traditional seaweed, soy paper, wheat or flour tortilla. If you don't want a burrito (which is crazy), you can get a rice bowl, salad bowl, or nachos. Also parents I saw they had a kids menu too, and I thought wow how thoughtful. Everything was priced pretty reasonably and it definitely won't break the bank.   You can opt to create your own as they have tons of selections from proteins, sauces, and to veggies. They also have a menu for house created burritos. The one I chose was the Twin Dragon, which is also a really good roll at the Soho Japanese restaurant. The Twin Dragon burrito includes spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and crab. Have I sold you yet ? Ok the sauce was chipotle mayo and unagi sauce with guacamole, cucumber, lettuce. At first bite I was in heaven.  The burrito wasn't too big or too small as I was able to finish one and feeling satisfied. The sauces tasted so good and house made. Like the spicy tuna was fresh and you can really taste it in the burrito. I also chose soy paper for my burrito and I think I made the right choice, as for me seaweed might have a slight chewy texture for burritos. I honestly want to try every burrito that they have concocted on their menu, they all looked good. I saw they had one with steak and tamago, looks delicious. My friend got a salad bowl with spicy tuna and crab. She said her salad was excellent and she couldn't stop eating it. The bowl size was perfect for her and she didn't leave hungry. I actually was pretty jealous of how great her bowl looked that I will definitely try that next time.  We saw that they had taro chips on the menu and at first we were going to add that with a combo but we decided we were gonna split an order of soho nachos, because why not they are taro chips. They informed us that  they house make their taro chips so I was all over that. We added spicy tuna, onions, pico de gallo, jalapenos and topped with their super spicy sauce. They were LOVE AT FIRST BITE! Taro chips are better than potato chips way better! And Soho Sushiburrito does them perfectly they seasoned them with furikake, I'm sorry I did not think those would go together but they are life! They do have have the chips as a combo size and they have cheese too yum!! I am very glad we chose to get the bigger portion of nachos because we devoured them. They are the show stopper they were so good I cannot recommend them enough.   We did however get mochi as a side with drinks. It makes more sense to opt for a combo since they tell you, you save a little money doing that so why not? But mochi seriously?! is there anything they didn't think of. Also they were delicious.   Thank you Chef John Lee and Soho for bringing this to Vegas, as we definitely need  sushi burritos in our lives.",

    "text": "Soho....Soooo good! I cannot get enough of this place. The sushi burritos are tasty and I'm addicted to their taro chips! Sin sauce...i could live without the sauce. I've been there a few times and tried various items from when they were JaBurritos, mainly when they were JaBurritos and their menu seems to have changed so I can't really talk about the menu items then but I did try the Santa Fe which was a bit spicy but I'm trying to build up my tolerance so this definitely helped with that. The ingredients were so fresh and my roll was easy to consume. It's big enough to keep me filled but not put me into a food coma. Watching them prepare my food and being able to call the shots is a nice way to put my mind at ease as far as trusting kitchen staff. The staff is always friendly and will to accommodate. Lunch time is a beast and I am warning you be prepared to wait. Every time I go on my lunch I am met with a line and a wait of over 20 mins. Luckily for me, my office is 5 minutes away so I still have time to enjoy my roll. Prices are reasonable as well. I always opt for the combo with chips and drink because again I AM ADDICTED TO THEIR TARO CHIPS. Definitely a healthier option than In-N-Out, McDonalds and cheaper than Landrys.",

They had these awesome discount cards that they gave to all new customers until April of this year. The concept of fish and fast food was totally revolutionary and now you see so many poke places popping up across the valley.   My favorite thing to get here is building my own bowl. I would get a blend of yellowtail / salmon / unagi. The food is fresh and the consistency is always the same. Very very few occasions, the brown rice would be slightly undercooked, but it's very close to perfect each time.   I used to come here 3-4 times a week, but now a new location opened near my house on Jones and Rainbow, so I'm going to be going to that one more!  Love this place and awesome idea / concept.",

I'm glad to report it is because they are ridiculously good. As in, I drive from the other side of town just to get one of these babies.  Super friendly service, great food. Just be aware that there aren't that many tables so it's better to do take out than dine in. Or go in at odd times.",

They come with pre-made combinations for anyone daunted, but they're all fully customizable. Amazing variety of ingredients. And they have some authentically foreign drinks and desserts to sample and enjoy.   I got the High Maintenance, minus wonton strips, plus cilantro and pico - and added on some Miso soup and JayOne Aloe Drink. Thoroughly enjoyed it, but after trying my friend's twin dragon, I wish I'd gone for that one instead.  Highly recommend the aloe drink. =)  They also have a wide variety of ice cream mochi: mango, green tea, coffee, black sesame - along with the usual vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry",

So that was a good sign.   I have heard of sushi burritos in California, I guess it is a very popular food truck. I was skeptical but all my friends say it's so good and to find out there is one Vegas I had to try it.   I had the high maintenance burrito, which had yellowtail and spicy tuna. I absolutely love yellowtail and this one caught my eye. The only thing is I had to ask for no masago, I just can't get past the texture.    Ok so I definitely understand the craze about these things. They are delicious!! The fish is very fresh and I was surprised and I thought to myself should I get more sauce? But it actually was very good. The creamy cilantro sauce was really good but I do want to try something spicier next time. I also got a side of their taro chips with cheese. The cheese was good but honestly these chips don't need them. They have this salty sweet seasoning to them that make them so addicting like I needed a bigger bag! I killed them!   So I went with their preselected menu for the burrito but I will for sure create my own next time. I saw they had bowls too but the burrito is pretty filling.    The seating is limited but it's a small place , I don't think they could fit anymore tables or chairs. The staff was fast and they were informative.   Will be back soon...",

My wife had a totally different burrito, so she was fine.  The line was not bad and we even found a place to sit.",

My friend hyped me to come here and I like the facility and the way the presentation is it but I had a hard time finishing my first half due to the weird flavors and unusual taste. I ended up opening the sushi wrap and just eating the spicy tuna and yellowtail by itself. I rather order a regular sushi roll. I'm normally not a picky eater but this is one of the few times I really couldn't finish my meal. Wonder how people can really enjoy this place. Not likely to come back",

I pretty much based it off of the 3 Amigos, but modified it to my liking.   I got:   * Sushi Rice Wrap  * Meat - Ahi Tuna ($7.50), Fresh Salmon (additional meat = $1.5)  * Sides/Toppings (free & no limit) - Cilantro, Corn, Red Onion, Tempura Crunch, Crispy Wonton Strips, Cucumber, Furikake   * Sauce - Wasabi Aioli  * Extra - Cream Cheese (50 cents)  Total = $10.29  [PROS] * I was satisfied w/ my order. It was yummy & filling  * The cream cheese was totally worth it & made it even better * The fish was fresh & they serve a generous amount * They're open on Sundays now. I was bummed that they were closed on Sundays, but now that they're open, I definitely plan on eating here  after church or something  [CONS] * Their menu is a little overwhelming just looking at it (especially as a newbie). But, once you get their concept, it's pretty cool & unique * It's a bit messy/dirty inside. Although we went there near closing time, I was a little bothered at how messy it was * It's quite loud inside. Not sure if it's the music or just the acoustics in their restaurant, but I had to speak louder than normal to have a conversation w/ my party * Although I enjoyed my roll, it tasted no different than a regular sushi hand roll.. But just wrapped & the size of a burrito  I'd definitely go back & try their Asada, or create a non-traditional sushi roll. Maybe that'll give me the True experience of Jaburrito aka Soho Sushi Burrito",

I did the B.Y.O sushi burrito and I got seaweed wrap, soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, unagi sauce, and sweet chipotle sauce. Usually when I order this everything is distributed evenly. The sauce was dripping out and couldn't even tell what I had inside of the burrito. It was not appetizing. I really hope they stay consistent with their orders. I would still come back. Maybe today was just a bad day and maybe they just had new employees. :( Other days it would be 4-5 stars but today is a 1 but giving them an extra star because they're amazing all the other times I've visited. I just couldn't eat my other half of my burrito. Smh. Very disappointed.  Updated review: 11/19/16  Ok so, way better experience! :) sushi burrito was made very well this time! (New pic update!)",

Both burritos that I had tonight (Sunny Salmon with Seaweed wrap and Lion King with soy wrap) were loaded up with tons of fresh ingredients.    Sunny Salmon consists of Salmon, Surimi Crab, cream cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, crispy wonton strips and Shiso tomatillo sauce for me it tasted a little dry and too healthy(lol) like a huge wrapped salad think it needed more sauce or dressing.  The Lion King however was perfect (for me) and the star of the evening loaded with Grilled Salmon, lettuce, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango soy, furkake and sweet chipotle mayo.    I will be back to try the other burritos and for that sweet chipotle mayo thinking I might substitute that out in the Sunny Salmon next time.   Definitely recommend checking this place out,  oh yeah they also have beer available for those that might like something more than a fountain drink. :)",

    "text": "Why can't we have one of these in Phoenix? This is my favorite place to eat when in Las Vegas. They are very vegan friendly and the customer service is always outstanding. Usually when I eat at a place multiple times I can get a bit embarrassed because I feel like i am always there. But not here. This place is too good and I get as much of it as I can while I am in town. Whenever I am in town I am usually only in Vegas for a couple days. This last time I ate here four times in two days. If you are not vegan this place is also good. I always order the Vegan Lover bowl. If you are not sure what to order just talk to one of the workers and they will explain everything to you. This needs to be on your list of places to try.",

WRONG- this place was magical! The workers were extraordinarily helpful and patient with me and my daughter. We ordered the Lion King since we both cannot consume raw meats. It had cooked salmon, tempura, chipotle mayo, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, teriyaki sauce, and a seaweed wrapper. Words cannot adequately express how great the Lion King sushi burrito tasted.  I later surprised my husband with a sushi burrito at his job. He was so pleased that his eyes were rolling in the back of his head. His team at work saw how much he loved it and now they are eager to try Soho SushiBurrito. After eating the Lion King, all I can say is 'Hakuna Matata.'",

    "text": "The portions were better than I expected. Let's be honest here, I'm a cheapskate, so I wasn't clammoring to try this place when I first heard it opened bc of the pricing. Yes, it's basically an uncut maki roll, but it's much bigger in diameter. If you were to cut these, you wouldn't be able to fit one piece in your mouth. I don't even know how they roll it with all the stuff they put in it. These guys are pros.  And they have this cool machine that puts the rice on your nori or soy paper on in seconds!   Your order goes down the line Chipotle-style and the guys assemble your burrito. Like I said, it's a generous amount of fish. We went on their anniversary day to take advantage of the BOGO special and I was also surprised they didn't skimp on the portions on sale day. Even at full price, while still pricey for lunch, is a much better deal (and better tasting) than supermarket sushi. And let's get real here, the sushi at Whole Foods market isn't that great and it's freaking expensive! Dollar for dollar, this place is more worth it. And more filling than I thought!  Authentic Japanese sushi this is not, but those purists with a stick up their ass can go eat somewhere else. This is America and this is American style sushi, and yes it's good. If you want \"real sushi\" made by a \"real Japanese chef\" and pay $50+ for a tiny meal then be my guest. If you're not one of those annoying purists, then come and give this place a try.",

There are pre-arranged sushi bowls and burritos you can pick from (perfect for an amateur like me) or you can build your own. I got the Waimea sushi bowl with a mixed greens base and opted to add avocado and extra salmon (extra charges). I usually order dressings on the side, but I forgot to note it while ordering. The orange vinaigrette wasn't overpowering, though, and it added to the bowl's overall refreshing flavor.  My husband got the 3 Amigos sushi burrito with a seaweed wrap, which is a favorite according to staff, and it was also delicious. Staff was kind and helpful. There is free parking and enough dining space for several groups to sit and eat. Orders can be made to-go and one can also order online for a quicker pick-up. This was a great place for a quick, light, and fulfilling lunch!  They, additionally, offer boba tea, assorted bottled drinks from Asia including Calpico, Thai iced tea, and Mango Creamy Soda, and sides including kimchi and mochi ice cream.",

Not only was the spicy tuna a bit bad, the steak tasted fairly old, and brown rice was a bit undercooked(some grains were still pretty hard).

I also ordered some taro chips with a cheese sauce to dip them in. Wow it was different but it was soooo flavorful. There was a line almost out the door the entire time.

I had come here before on two separate occasions and ordered the twin dragon burrito and then a twin dragon on lettuce (I gave up carbs for a couple weeks). Neither of those two options satisfied my palette and thought that my love for sushi was lost.   Then I decided the last time I went that I would just change what I ordered and decided on something simple. I got the fire cracker which is spicy tuna and a honey chipotle sauce with some garnishes, amazing!   Now I'm thinking \"maybe my tastebuds are just simple\" the Twin drag had a lot going on and a lot of flavors that didn't connect with me. It's in a large shopping center, but folks love this place for lunch, and now me too! I appreciate the option to go vegetarian, and the other options for the kids. Definitely a go to place if you love sushi like I do, and would like fusion for lunch.",

    "text": "When two of my favorite cuisines fuse into a cult following type restaurant, I have to give it five stars.   It's a tiny place that right now may be a little hard to find because of the construction going on in the plaza, but it's definitely worth it. It's next to the shoe place if that makes it easier.   The best way I can describe Soho SushiBurrito is a mix of Cafe Rio and Chipotle... except with Japanese ingredients. Doesn't make sense? Well basically all the ingredients are laid out for you to choose (or you can choose an item from the menu) and it's rolled into a burrito. So think sushi rolled into a big burrito a la Chipotle style.   The most pleasant surprise for me was the Taro chips. You can choose from traditional or furikake flavored and it even comes with yellow nacho cheese sauce. I tried the Furikake with the cheese (like nachos) and it was an interesting mix of flavors. Not bad, just interesting.   I like the place and highly recommend it because I'm a sushi lover... And this place makes eating sushi convenient and neat. The sizes are filling and you can get as creative as you like with the ingredients. Take note though, it gets busy. We were there ten minutes before they opened and there was already a line of six people before us.   I love the concept, a definite must-try.",

The girl who was in charge of starting a bowl/burrito was so rude. None of the staff looked happy at all. The tuna was very good. Yellowtail tasted a bit old, but I haven't got any stomach pains yet. I just feel like this place isn't somewhere I want to go to again.  Other sushi burritos are opening up in Vegas, so Soho should really try stepping up their game.",

The last time I came here (like 2 weeks ago), I noticed signs about online ordering so I have yet to try that out & see how efficient it is.  1 star deducted bc of the checkout experiences I've had every time I stop by. I always verify which burritos I've ordered before I swipe, but whenever they've put the order in the bag they always forget at least 1 burrito that I paid for. Then when I tell them that they missed one, they make it seem like it screws up the whole line. There's minimal communication between the line & cashier so hopefully it's better the next time I visit.",

Last time I went they got my order wrong and they gave me another burrito for free and I probably wouldn't have even noticed the order was wrong lol. Only thing i dislike is the condiment section I wish there was more to choose from besides just soy sauce and that red chile sauce, wasabi would be a nice addition. Small store but it's fine more like a Vegas gem hard to find the better. Most def will be coming back",

About 3 weeks ago while my burrito was being made as it was almost finished one of the girls found a hair, when the told the first person on the line to make a new one he got very defensive and made a face, I didn't receive any kind of apology or anything all the girl said was \"good thing I found it.\" As if I was the one who put it there.....moving forward to today I stopped by after work to pick up a burrito on my way home, line was short and quick which was perfect. When I got home I dug in like any other person. Only after 4 bites I found a hair in my found. With the weak stomach I have clearly I gagged and threw everything out. Will not be returning back to this location ever again, little mishaps I can agree with were all human, but 2 times in less than a month? NO THANK YOU!",

They do their job and they're friendly, so no complaints here. Id say this is a good alternative to AYCE sushi because the \"burrito\" is super filling and the cost is equivalent to one sushi roll if you decided to order a la carte. It's great when you're craving some sushi! Also, both times I went they were fairly busy and I had to wait in line. But the line moves super quick since they make it right in front of you. Awesome place! :)",

They have set items that you can choose from, whether it's a bowl or a burrito, but you can also customize your own. They have so many sauces/condiments that you can choose from as well; it was a bit overwhelming, and the workers were not helpful in explaining each of the sauces or which one paired well with what.   Got the Twin Dragon burrito which included shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab which is imitation crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, and unagi sauce wrapped in seaweed. I also told them to add salmon sashimi in my burrito. It was pretty good. The vegetables were fresh, and the shrimp tempura and the wonton strips gave a nice crunch to the burrito. Don't expect Jiro quality fish here, but if you're looking for a quick bite during your lunch break or you're on the go, this place is worth a try.   I will be back to try one of their bowls.",

I could have made a custom burrito but to me that is part of the rating. Jaburritos has 2 or 3 different burritos where I like topping combinations.   The burrito didn't have fish spread evenly throughout the roll so that I could get a bite of fish and toppings. But, it also wasn't fully rolled so it ended up completely falling apart not great to me but at least I could mix in the fish with the toppings.   Drink selection is also not very good in my opinion and the decor and tables/seating seems very cheap. Definitely recommend going to Jaburritos if you can and especially if you are experiencing Sushi burritos for the first time.",

    "text": "Mmm, been wanting to check this place out, been checking out the menu for a while, now. Today, finally, yes, hubby (didn't seem interested, when I mentioned it to him, but said I \"didn't tell him it was like Chipotle\") got me takeout, the Fire Cracker burrito @ $5.25 (spicy tuna, cucumber, lettuce, cabbage, crispy wonton strips, honey habanero sauce, sweet chipotle mayo) on seaweed paper. I am savoring this yummy meal. I admit it, sometimes, I eat fast. Not now, it's too good, so I'm trying to make it last. I succeeded. It was amazing.   I love the concept of fusion food (Braddah's---sad face, we'll miss that place, the food truck Truknyaki is the bomb, but a bit elusive) but few live up to the hype and excitement (Komex was good, but...). Not the case with this joint. I love sushi but I this was the first time I ever had a sushi burrito and it was a yummy experience (if I get a burrito at traditional mexican restaurants, I don't usually finish it, 'cause it's too big of a meal for me). I feel satisfied but my belly doesn't feel like it's full of bricks. (No likey.)  I am Pinay so I do love my food medium spicy, especially nowadays, because of my restricted diet (low sodium) monday through friday. My lips were tingling but that is exactly the way I like it. Spicy tuna is also one of my favorites, which was tasty. All the ingredients seem to compliment each other very well. It was all exactly in the right proportion too. Listen, there was nothing I disliked about this sushi burrito. It was perfection. I would get it again.  I would like to try some of the other items on the menu or maybe even create my own combo (build your own). Hubby wants to try it too. Like Chipotle, you choose between the burrito, bowl or nachos and select the proteins, sauce, fixings, etc. Also serves Vegetarian, Kids menu and sides (taro chips, edamame, miso soup, seaweed salad, & mochi ice cream).",

The price is cheaper than any other sushi bowl place, the quantity is more than their competitors and the quality of food and taste is 100 times better than any place I've been. I just drove to the other side of Vegas to go to this specific sushi bowl place passing many others on the way. 5 stars and I highly recommend the \"O\" sauce if you are looking for recommendations.",

    "text": "This place has been on my list for a while, and now I'm thinking, \"What the eFF was I waiting for?!\"  This place is incredible - think fresh sushi served at a fast food assembly line pace.   It's like you want a quick and healthy sushi meal but without the hassle of sitting down and waiting on service. Before Soho, the idea of fast food sushi never sounded appealing because of the freshness factor. Here, what they do is have the fresh ingredients in front of you as you put together a custom meal or choose from one of their premade selections.  On this visit, instead of a custom, tried two signature Sushi Burritos: Twin Dragon (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab, guac, chipotle mayo) & 3 Amigos (ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon).  Of the two, I can't say one was better than the other - both so delicious.    Twin Dragons ($10.50) got a nice kick from the mayo and spicy tuna, as well as more of a crunch texture from the tempura.  Meanwhile, I loved the 3 Amigos ($10.95) for having the variety of proteins and still being able to have a clean and light flavor - it didn't at all feel heavy after finishing the whole thing.   I'll be coming back and to try more burritos and have again, the all-day Sapporo happy hour ($3 draft from the Katana sword handle)   My only suggestion is to do something about the dining area - place gets so packed on the weekend! We almost went to eat in the car",

    "text": "Very cool concept like a Japanese Chipotle, but the line is so long and doesn't move quickly.    We got there at 11:30am only 30 minutes after opening and the line was at least 10 deep.   You can choose a burrito or a bowl with seaweed paper, soy paper, white or brown rice.    They have a menu with several already created options including sushi style items, steak and eggs, chicken options or you can just build your own.   We ordered the unagi special and the firecracker burrito style.   Both were very flavorful and packed with ingredients.  It like a very big hand roll, but unlike the hand roll it's a thin layer of rice so you don't get full from everything else and not the rice.  You can make it a meal and get a side and drink.    When we walked in saw a sign for ordering online if we ever go back definitely using it since we saw several people just walk in and right back out with their food.     They have some very fancy equipment to make the seaweed rice burrito wrap and a cool labeling machine.  Parking is pretty easy since it's in a shopping center.",

Stumbled across this spot and I'm glad I did. It was a great first impression!  You can make them more typical burrito like or more sushi like. I leaned towards sushi like because I love sushi. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna were my proteins of choice. They were not stingy with the protein which is a major plus for me. I got it wrapped in the seaweed with white rice- also typical sushi style. I had some buffalo sauce and lettuce in there which took away from the sushi feel so ill probably lean away from that next time.   Mine and my wife's together came to about $15. Really can't beat that. I left satisfied and I have a pretty serious appetite. The wife was full until about lunch the day after. I call this a win.   Definitely go here.",

I've been to other sushi burrito places but this is the only place that I know of where it actually has a DIY option.   1) You get to choose: bowl? Nachos? Burrito? 2) Add your proteins! 3) Add your toppings and sauce!  There's also some premade items on the menu for you to choose from as well. We got the twin dragon, which comes with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, crispy wonton strips, unagi sauce and sweet chipotle mayo. I opted for the DIY so I got salmon, yellowtail, chipotle mayo, baby spinach, cilantro, cucumbers, roasted corn and cream cheese. You can also mix and match different sauces if you like (without an extra charge!)  Overall, both our burritos tasted really great. Prices are good too for what you pay for. I would definitely come here again! Credit cards accepted and there's plenty of parking.",

Everything was 100% satisfactory. Ingredients are fresh, flavor is on point, and no complaints whatsoever. The taro chips are coated in a sweet layer of furikake that pairs so well with it too! There was a bar with condiments but honestly, none was needed. Not only do they offer sushi burritos, but also salads, rice bowls and nachos -- with protein choices raw & cooked, and a full topping bar of 15 fresh vegetable items.

    "text": "The first time I was here I got one of their signature burritos and remembered it being really delicious, don't remember much else.   Last week my co-workers and I came here for lunch and I was hugely disappointed. First, my co-worker asked one of the staff which base is the best with one of the bowls she wanted to try, the guy waved his arms around and said \"it varies...I don't know..\" Not the best way to advertise your food and help your customers.   My complaint has nothing to do with the quality of the food; veggies were fresh, fish were cold and fresh, great flavors. I just don't think its worth the price. If you have ever been to Too See Roll, I think you will agree that TSR is much better.   I don't like that this place has limited fish options, the most expensive bowl gives you 2 fishes and anything else is extra. Their toppings are also very limited and don't really fit well with the concept of the bowls: guacamole, sour cream, red onions, pico...seems like toppings at Chipotle more than toppings for sushi bowls. Common toppings such as seaweed salad is also extra. TSR has so many more toppings that are all included and they also allow more variety of fish at around the same price.   Don't think I will come back here, not that food isn't good, I just like more variety and options with my bowl which this place just does not offer. But if you live far from TSR then this place will just have to do.",

    "text": "I thought this place was great but not oh my god I need to come every day type of great. We came when the storefront was under construction and the name had recently changed. That meant the menus names had changed, but luckily I knew I wanted to get a bowl. I customized my bowl with sushi rice, salmon, soft shell crab and imitation crab. I also of course upgraded it to a combo just so I could try these delicious taro chips that everyone raved about. Which I admit, the taro chips were delicious with the nacho cheese sauce which I'm a sucker for. I liked that they had their own \"house soy sauce\" as I love salty sauces. The process was fairly easy, but I could definitely see how there could be a wait if it was during a rush. My bowl was ok. The rice was hard and was almost like it was last nights rice. The salmon was ok too and they charged me extra for sliced avocado since I didn't want the guacamole. I didn't feel like everything was overly amazing so I won't be making my way back purposely unless I'm in that neighborhood. It's a small place so if it's during a rush don't expect to get a table.   3.5 stars",

    "text": "The Struggle is Real -   Today at lunch, I've seen nothing but struggle and bad customer service. I love this place - don't get me wrong. The firecracker is so spicy and delicious, I crave it in my sleep. I never come here during the lunch rush since I don't like to drive hungry/hangry. My co-workers and bosses wanted some sushi burrito so we decided that i'd snack beforehand and venture. SO this review not based on HANGRY-me's interlude. The place was hoppin'. The line was long, but they were moving along. Diligent worker bees they are. The problems are listed below:  1. The person who does the rice part seemed to care more about making nice with her co-workers than she cared to be polite with the customers.    - This isn't some street food join, have some respect.  2. There were two people dealing with the insides of the burrito as well as the forming and wrapping of it. They seemed really hasty and one guy pretty much didn't care how it rolled. Needless to say, some of our burritos fell apart...  3. The guy writing the orders on the wrappers - he was screwing up big time leaving the cashier guy really really pissed. The order before us seemed to be wrong and the cashier had to open one of their burritos and couldn't figure it out so he had to make another one on the fly..making the wait longer.   4. The cashier guy had a face that easily left a bad taste in my co-workers mouth. She also didn't appreciate the fact that he was opening up all these burritos with his cash-handled hands, wrapping it back up, and serving it to us. I get that it's really annoying that the guy before you is screwing up on writing the orders properly, but I feel like if you're handling money, you shouldn't handle the food.  All of our burritos fell apart, but we enjoyed the taste. Just wish that they knew how to handle the lunch rush without any issues.  The guy writing on the wrappers though..he needs to learn to code the burritos correctly so people get charged correctly and ALSO so that the cashier doesn't have to open it up.  Tastes good, but service needs a bit of work.  This place is really popular though, maybe an expansion is in order for the weekdays! - Just kidding, what do I know about business.",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch around 1pm and the line was almost out the door! The line moved fairly quickly though since there were quite a few workers on the line making your orders.   Being a big fan of sushi, I had no idea what to order since everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the 3amigos since it seemed to be one of the most popular items. The size is pretty good and the fish to rice ratio was just right. They don't rip you off by filling up the burrito with more rice than fish. The fish tasted fresh and overall it reminded me of something I could get at a sushi restaurant but in a larger form. The Mexican flavors didn't stand out too much with this one. I also ordered the taro chips with cheese...sounds very strange but somehow it works and it was so delicious! The chips are coated in a slightly sweet and salty seasoning, maybe furikake? I highly recommend getting a side of this along with your sushirito. I will come back to try some of the other menu items!   Seating is limited so if you come during a busy hour you might not find a seat. Be prepared to take it to go just in case!",

    "text": "Soho SushiBurrito just might be one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  They have a friendly attentive staff who quickly make the sushi burritos to order.  I prefer the soy paper to nori as my wrapper of choice, and the team there always has what I want on hand.  The decor is modest but warm, and it feels organic and natural.  The dining area is small, but they do make orders to go if you are in a hurry or need to get back to work or home.  The interior is bright and clean with lots of sunshine (well, it will be once the outdoor construction ends).  But the real reason I go here is the food.  The sushi burritos are outstanding, and cover a wide range of flavors and textures.  The hand rolls to try are the Triple S, Twin Dragon, and 3Amigos.  The Triple Dragon features spicy tuna, crab, and shrimp tempura, which are three flavors that work well together.  The soft tuna plays well against the crunchy shrimp, and all of the ingredients play well together (lettuce, guac, cucumber, crispy wonton, spicy mayo, unagi sauce),  Most rolls are at or under $10 and are quite large, so you are getting very good value for your dollar.   You can order the food as a burrito, or as a bowl or even nachos (which I will try next time).  You can choose one of their rolls, or make your own, and the also have selections for vegetarians and even for kids.    They are open for most of the day, making lunch or dinner a good option.  I envision many more visits in the coming months!",

I got the twin dragon and added masago. I was really pleased with how much shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and surimi crab was put into my burrito. This place does not skimp. I almost thought they weren't going to be able to roll up my burrito properly because of how much stuff they put inside. The burritos here are well proportioned. The ingredients are pretty decent quality and fairly priced. The only thing that I didn't love was the guacamole in my burrito. I love guac as much as the next person but in a sushi burrito I'd prefer just straight avocado. I still love SoHo SushiBurrito though! Please expand to Dallas!",

You can even customize your own towards your craving desires! They even do seaweed or rice paper wraps or bowls if you don't feel like eating it as a roll. Of course if you are allergic to fish or certain items, they also have cooked meets to replace the fish. Yes they do follow hand hygiene and sterile procedures for people who are allergic. This place is still busy and small, so try to get there before or after peak hours (Lunch and dinner) for less of a wait.",

If you've had Sushiritto in San Francisco, you're in for a disappointment. The rolls are more expensive, smaller and definitely not as good.  The place was packed, the line was about 10 minutes long when I went in on Saturday night. The kids working behind the counter were working hard so I have no complaints there. However, the smell of raw fish was way too strong for me to comfortably sit and eat there. I had to take it to go- also it was unbearably hot inside. Hot temps and the smell of raw fish? Not my scene. It's in the plaza with Landry's Seafood, David's Bridal and Mcdonalds across from Palace Station.   Will the crowds stay once the novelty wears off? We'll see.",

I was impressed by how fresh all the ingredients were! Plus they have an awesome machine that compresses your roll at the end to make sure it doesn't fall apart. I tried the spicy tuna which was delicious and don't forget to add a sauce! (Loved the screaming o, chipotle mayo and wasabi aoli). The best part is the very fair and reasonable prices!

My third visit here, but first under Soho, I went with the same and my personal favorite customized order which consists of the seaweed wrapper, sushi rice, and I chose tuna and salmon with cucumber, green onions, seaweed salad, and poke sauce.  When I order a custom roll this is what I get also but seaweed salad on the side.  They have specialized burritos you can choose from as well if you don't know what you want.  I do think it's cool how the rice dispencer works though, spreads it out evenly on the sushi wrap.      If your taste buds can handle sushi then I definitely recommend coming and trying this place.  Be warned, the taro chips they have here is very good.  But I feel as though the passion for sushi has been dumbed down here.",

    "text": "First 2 visits were great! Sol ad this concept is finally in Vegas. The components were fresh and the service was quick considering all the customizing going on. I always opt to build my own and it's usually using shrimp tempura as my protein (it's basic but I love it whatever) and I loved that they heat up the shrimp before assembling the burrito. The crab salad is good and so is the soy paper. There plenty of sauces to choose from and the Yuzu soy is really good. They even have a machine to tighten up the burrito so it doesn't explode while eating like it would at chipotle. Price is great and good value to get a \"sushi\" fix in a hurry.   My last visit wasn't so great. Also a shrimp tempura option and I felt rushed this time so I didn't notice till it was too late that it was cold tempura and when the girl who seemed visually annoyed from the start asked 4 times what my sauces were after I said one second let me read them. I chose two sauces and she DOUSED my burrito with sauces so the whole thing was soggy and I couldn't taste any of the other extras I had paid for. I realize they're not cooks or anything but just some common sense when you put them together. Would you wanna eat a burrito soaking in Yuzu soy? Probably not.   Now that I've experienced indifferent service there I'll be more specific about the amount of things I want when I choose components.   Other than that this place is solid. Good good good prices.",

I could have done without the cream cheese, so next time I'll customize it.  I also got a fire cracker with seaweed paper and sushi rice burrito. So freakin delicious!! Definitely getting one again.  I also ordered a Santa Fe (because I wanted to try a lot). I did a burrito with soy paper. The cheese sauce looks like nacho cheese sauce, but tastes like a creamy cheese. The chicken was very moist and as a whole it was a sweet/spicy mix.   Overall, this is worth the drive and the wait.",

Seeing my friends' pictures never really looked the appetizing. I love sushi, but the thought of making it into a burrito seemed like too much of a good thing to me. Well just so happened that my family and I needed to grab lunch before an appointment to go wedding dress shopping and just so happen that this place was right across the street from the boutique. I figured why not give it a shot since this place has such great reviews. I was pleasantly surprised! There were four of us and each of us got a different sushirito; all were wonderful. Portions sizes left you satisfied, and not overly stuffed. Great balance of flavors in their signature rolls.  I feel like if I'm craving sushi but don't necessarily feel like dishing out the money for AYCE, then this place will definitely satisfy!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  Also the taro chips are a must!!",

I love how all the vegetarian options are listed together and there is even one called \"Vegan Lover\" now! I give this place a 4.5 star now! I always know what I want but people who are not familiar can simply choose a veggie choice now! +.5 stars :)   I'm going to post what I had written a few weeks ago because the product nor my item choice has changed::::: I'm a huge fan of Sushiritto in SF. Well now I'm spoiled because I have SOHO less than ten minutes from my house!  Super vegan or veggie friendly. I get the Gardein steak, spicy vegan mayo, nori paper, sushi rice, and alllllllllll the veggies!   Veggie menu choices are easy to select from.  I love all the flavors combined. At first I was like \"grilled corn and steak flavor in my sushiritto, hell no.\" But I tried it and it's sooooo yummy! I am a huge seaweed salad lover so I usually unwrap and add some seaweed salad. And of course while I'm unwrapped I add ginger and wasabi! I like it spicy!  I have also tried a bite of a vegan Mex style, the Gardein steak, grilled corn, lettuce, pico, spicy vegan mayo, avocado, tomatoes, soy paper wrap, brown rice. It was also good! My husband usually gets something like that because he is NOT a fan of anything sushi smelling, no nori or wasabi for him!   I have gotten my combo bowl style also but there is just something yummy and comfort food with that burrito style. Maybe because all the extra tortilla calories?!?! Oh well, just eat it.  The line can get super long at lunchtime so I usually go around 1-2pm weekdays. Never been on a weekend. Since its new I'm sure it's a total madhouse.   Soooooo yummy just go and get one right now!",

Try the green tea or sweet southern tea (i know its iced tea, but idk, just damn good tea)   Really fulfills all sushi cravings.  Add kim-chi to any burrito for $.50 every time I walk into this restaurant the whole staff is so genuinely welcoming, kind,  and I don't know where they keep finding all these great employees, honestly! I do recommend getting a meal, you have an option of getting a drink and then seaweed salad or mochi. I tried the mochi for the first time today and it's fresh and really powdery and perfect.    I will add that I've tried a couple around town and this is still the best one. Price wise, and they steer you in the right direction instead of giving you overwhelming amounts of options.",

    "text": "The concept was great but I believe for the popularity of this idea, it was poorly executed. The food itself, yeah it's good! The service on the other hand, not so much. The line where the food was being prepared was just a little messy and all over the place. They've only been open for a few months so they may get better in time.   Another concern that I had was that it was difficult to choose from their vast amount of toppings. It would've been easier to pick if their were labels directly on the glass (similar to Subway)  Easy to see. Easy to choose. Simple!  My husband made his own sushi burrito and I decided to make my own nachos - which I was pretty disappointed with the chicken. It was flavorless and tasted like it came out of a frozen package... It would've been much better if it were a katsu chicken or a marinaded and grilled chicken (similar to Mochiko's grilled chicken).  In this case, it's True to not go to a sushi burrito place and order chicken nachos!  All in all, not too bad and good prices.  Next time I'll come back and order one of their more popular and recommended choices!",

For lunch, I ordered the Twin Dragon and a the Melon Cream Soda. Flavor wise, its nothing to brag about. Same fillings as you would get at a normal sized sushi roll but needs more seasoning for my taste. It's not bland, there's no \"wow\" factor for me, it just served it's purpose of something decent to calm my hunger. If you're like me after eating an AYCE sushi, you get hungry an hour later.  A little bit out of my way but I'll still come back to see if I like any of the other menu items and try the rice bowls next time maybe, but I'm in no rush. Service wise though, I get my food fast and the team making the food are always upbeat! Always a good thing when someone's hangry.",

I always get the Sex Bomb roll at KAYA and love it so I looked up the menu and relayed the message ! I built my roll with seaweed wrap, sushi rice . protein was salmon,shrimp tempura, and eel. Sauce was Cajun aioli,eel sauce, and creme cheese. Toppings were Crunch and sesame seeds! Okay it came out soooooo good! My boyfriend ordered the dragon roll. We ordered edamame but they were really cold . I like mine a little hot with some dressing. They also had 3 dollars Sapporo . Such a good meal and less than 25 dollars for two people!

Don't do it, because your food will turn bad on the way to you, and they don't care because they put no efforts to try to keep your food at the right temperature.

This is a solid place if you're craving sushi, but be aware the fish is definitely not fresh and lacks any flavor. The servers were really nice though and stacked my burrito full with toppings. I really enjoyed being able to customize what I wanted. I would advise against getting the cup of seaweed salad though. I love seaweed salad but was disappointed that the cup I bought ended up being a pretty small amount, especially for the price I paid.  Overall, it was a good experience just to say I've tried a sushi burrito, but otherwise would not come here again.",

Again, I'm still getting used to the whole raw fish thing. So I was happy to see three different menu options that included meat.  I went with the steak and eggs. It also had cream cheese, delicious sauces, spinach and crunchy bits. As well as a side of cheese sauce for dipping just because I wanted to try it. Good decisions all around. I'd absolutely do the same again.   Hubby can't even remember what he got. He simply asked for what was most popular. What it was, I actually loved it. Raw fish and all. I'm pretty sure it was something with crab and tuna.   We also ordered side of cheese toro chips and picked up a can of Guava juice. They chips are your  basic toro chips with a seasoning that makes them taste like Doritos, which I think is fantastic!",

    "text": "I'm so happy we finally have something good to eat at the Student Union. For years, it's been Panda Express and Subway which is why I'd only come to SU for drinks from Jamba or Starbucks. Or I'd go across the street for edible options.   This place opens at 9:30am which is pretty sweet because I can grab my 2nd breakfast and lunch before I go to my class. It's super convenient for students and other UNLV peeps. They've only been open for a few days and the line gets pretty crazy. However, they move quite fast so the wait isn't too bad - well, maybe, except when people in front of you stare at the menu for hours and still couldn't decide what to get. You're sh|+ out of luck. Hopefully, you can utilize the pictures of the menu I posted so, you're not THAT person.  Just like the other Soho locations, they have sushi burritos or sushi burrito bowls, chips, edamame, mochi, etc. They have signature combos or you can build your own. Brown rice, white rice, sushi rice, salad, tofu + your choice of protein (salmon, surimi, tuna, chicken, steak, veggie asada, tempura, soft shell crab...you get the idea) + veggies and texture enhancers (crunch, wontons) + sauce.  They're pretty chill with substitutions as long as it's of similar category - like green onions instead of red onions. Don't expect them to swap your red onions with spicy tuna - life doesn't work that way!  They're open til 8pm and closed on Sunday. They don't have chopsticks but everyone knows how to use a fork. So, goooo!!!",

This is the best fusion I have seen in the fast casual space for Asian and Mexican.  I really try to make it fusion with making sure that I have pieces that are distinctly one versus the other.  Wife got to enjoy this place with me this time and she was just as big of a fan.  We both made our own burrito.  The fish tastes fresh, no issues with quality on that front.  There are lots of options for fillings and for sauces.  All the ones we have tried have been good.  The taro chips with cheese sauce was also good.  I would recommend staying with the original flavor for the chips as the other ones seem to have a little too much powdered seasoning.  Only complaint is that there isn't one of these back where I live!",

The menu is very well designed with plenty of customization or you can choose from combinations they have already thought out. These are the best poke/sushi burritos I have had, not just in Las Vegas either. This place has a great reputation and you can see why if you choose to come here. The food is delicious, fresh and good for you. I must come here all the time now!",

When we got there the place was pretty packed - we were lucky to find a table. My girlfriend got the special on rice paper, I got the Fire Cracker on seaweed, along with two beers each (happy hour all day - beers only $3!).

The ponzu sauce is really good, make sure to ask for that opposed the soy sauce.   Even with my 4 star rating (because of the skimpy soft shelled crab serving), I will be coming back!",

I thought that the ahi would be a square but in this case, it wasn't. The spicy ahi is a little too spicy for me but that's just me. Next time and for all of my upcoming visits, I will stick to the sushiritto and not the bowl.   Definitely use UberEATS when ordering.

She is absolutely rude and talks about their customers with her coworkers. She and her coworkers talk through their eyes whenever they see something funny. Mind you AIRA, you have a job because of the customers, not because of your employer. So you better start treating customers right or just get out of the food service business.   I've been coming to Soho for quite some time now because I like the rice bowls. I wouldn't recommend the burrito bec it is overstuffed and it falls apart easily. My favorite was Sunny Salmon with sweet chipotle mayo, ponzu sauce, extra cucumbers, cilantro and corn. Their taro chips with furikake is the bomb! (Without the cheese sauce) Soho is my go-to place when I'm craving for sushi and when I got no time for AYCE.   Unfortunately, they've lost a loyal customer today. Nobody wants to be coming in to a place and feel awkward at all! Talked to manager Lily over the phone and told me she would handle the situation. She was actually honest to say that other customers had other issues with the employees. If so, it reflects the training ground they had! Who's to blame now?",

Same menu (just different names), same location, same layout, and it seems like the prices are pretty much the same.  I always get the Firecraker (aka previous name: Rosarito) and my boyfriend gets the Triple S (aka previous name: Rockport). I know that is one of their more popular burritos. We also got the taro chips with nacho cheese. The cheese is whatevers. Like what Stefany V said, it's nothing but 7-eleven/stadium nacho cheese. It used to come in a bigger container. Now it's given to us in a small measly condiment cup. The taro chips are pretty good....very good seasoning...heard it's Furikake seasoning? The burritos CAN be a little bit expensive with an average price of $10 per order. BUT....that usually how much an a la carte sushi order is sooooo..... *shrugs* to each their own I guess.  I really wish they can do something about the seating. It can be difficult to snag a table especially if you come during prime time lunch/dinner hours. I was there when there was a party of 6+ and almost half of the tables/seats were taken. I lucked out getting a table because a couple was just leaving. If not, I would've had to sit on the floor to eat. =/ Hopefully when the weather warms up, outside seating can be an option.",

    "text": "Apparently while I was out of town for the holidays, this spot underwent a name change- same staff, same product and menu, same quality, just a name change to show they'd \"merged with the owner's first restaurant.\" Which was already common knowledge.  The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, some with Mexican influences. Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.  Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.  The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is. The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit. The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated. TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again.   Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling.",

So far for all the times I've been here all the fish has been fresh. Let's hope they keep that up.   Bad things I can note is that I found a piece of plastic in my sushi burrito here before and that was not a nice surprise and depending on your burrito roller that if they don't roll it tight enough it will all fall apart in your hand making it very difficult to eat.   Taro chips with cheddar dip is amazeballs. Light, thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned the way any chip should taste. Goes great with their salsa too!! Loveeeee their salsa lol",

It's a great concept and marketing of something that's been around forever.   It's not a burrito first of all what it really is, a full sushi roll cut in half and packaged like a burrito that's it. You go in and can choose standard seaweed or soy paper then they ask what you want In it. It's a customized sushi roll. They have some that are already designated rolls or go for the complete custom choice.   I wasn't impressed it's a great concept who ever came up with it but all it is, is a sushi roll. I basically paid $14 for a meal that came with 1 roll some taro chips and a drink. I rather have gone to a sushi bar and paid few more dollars and gotten all you can eat. I wasn't full after the meal.   Would I go back again? Only if it was my only option    Otherwise I'd skip it.",

    "text": "Formerly Jaburrito, I spoke with one of the clerks who said that the owner is actually the same owner of Soho on 215, and wanted to unify the soho name in Las Vegas. This is what prompted the name change but the most suspicious thing to me is why change all of the names of the signature burritos? Nonetheless the burritos are the same but some of the signature items are a dollar or two cheaper   If you like their facebook or instagram page you get a free salmon nigiri pen !  Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot.   Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.  Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). Loads of options to add to your burritos so take advantage of it.   Service: Friendly and willing to explain how their menu works. Previously half of my burrito fell on the floor but they did not hesitate to bring me a new whole burrito :)  Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.  Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Soho burrito has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay.",

Came on Saturday around 1:40pm and the line was close to the door. It was about 2:15 when I reached the front. The concept is similar to Chipotle except you can either pick a menu combo or create your own (price is a la carte). I had the 3Amigos on seaweed with sushi rice which was delicious. If you're not a fan of wasabi, like me, the aioli surprisingly adds a nice underlying and vague taste which enhanced the burrito. Best part are the little crunchies! It was definitely filling without making you feel full.   I recommend expecting to take your food to go. There are about 20 seats in the place as it isn't very big. Parking might be tough as well. Enjoy!",

If you call making a giant sushi roll while calling it a burrito \"fusion,\" that is!  Either way, it's pure genius and extremely YUMMY.  I went with the recommendation of the employee working the creation station ordered a couple of the more popular burritos.  And I learned why they are popular.  First, the Twin Dragon - Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Lettuce, Cucumber, Guacamole, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Unagi Sauce.  It was a great size and the flavor was also amazing.    Second, the 3 Amigos - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cilantro, Masago, Crispy Wonton Strips, Wasabi Aioli.  If I could do this again I would skip or get less wasabi.  Otherwise, 100% pure awesome.   I'm really surprised there aren't places like this in Southern California. There are many, many poke places but no pokeburrito places! I'm sure if there were a few it would be off the hook.  And to the extent that there may be places like this in California, I haven't seen one that does it anywhere near as well as this place.  In any case, this location has now become a mandatory stop on all Las Vegas trips. Highly recommended!",

Fish was fresh and the flavors were good. Could have used a little eel sauce or spicy mayo to push it over the edge to incredible. The twin dragon on the other hand was overly sweet presumably due to too much eel sauce. The minced tuna that was in there wasn't very fresh tasting either so we had to kind of squeeze that out of the roll to make it edible. Soda fountain and four different kinds of peak iced tea. Dining area is basic but clean. Will probably come back to try out the other rolls. This place is more of a teriyaki sushi fusion place than any of the other sushi burrito concepts I've been to so far.",

You can customize your own sushi burrito or order a specialty burrito off their menu. They make the burritos right in front of you so you can see then put the ingredients in your burrito. If you prefer to have a bowl instead you can opt for that option. Also for your burrito you can have it wrapped in soy paper or seaweed.  The fish is really fresh and the sauces are amazing. They have a dozen different sauces you can add to your burrito or bowl. Try their different sauces to fit your taste buds. 5 stars for awesome food and service!",

Doing two at once; well double the pleasure, double the fun!  The sushi burrito.  Basically an uncut makisushi roll stuffed full with west coast poke bowl ingredients.   Straight up, everyday ingredients.  No organic this or line caught that.  Fish is previously frozen, gassed and color added. Crab is Krab.   Everyday rice.  Sushi rice is sticker than most, brown rice, the inexpensive kind that makes noobs cringe with its nutty flavor.  Loads of poke bowl ingredients, some cooked, some raw, some different (grilled steak or deep fried soft shell crab, roasted corn, pico de gallo) and loads of them.  Fillings make up 90% of the roll.  Don't worry, a machine compacts the roll and seals everything in.  First timers opt for premade rolls, good flavor with the right choice of fillings.  Adventurous, opt for do it yourself.  Choose a wrapper (nori, soy paper, or tortilla), rice (sushi, brown, unseasoned white), protein, sauce, and veg.  Be creative and go crazy.  It's part of the fun.  Let's just say a soft shell crab and unagi with creamy cilantro sauce, jalepeno peppers, avocado, and seaweed salad killed it!  Bravo me!  Very fast, friendly, off Strip service.  Good prices.  All options sub $10.  Satisfying and leaves you with a glow and smile.",

It's set up like Chipotle or Subway, in that they move your wrap along the counter as they add successive ingredients. Absolutely delectable flavors, but $10 for what's basically a large sushi roll is a bit much.",

Both were filled super full with ingredients, I'd say you get about two sushi rolls at least worth of rice and food per burrito. I was definitely full with one burrito. Also tried the taro chips, they were nice enough to let us try one of each flavor, I liked them all. Strangely it is served with that bright yellow fake cheese normally found on movie theater nachos, but it works. Also tried the ice cream mochi, the mango was good. I would recommend if for no other reason than the novelty, but I think I would like it even if the rolls were more traditionally arranged. Want to try the nachos next time.",

My only flaw with this place is the spicy tuna was extremely salty. Other than that everything was so fresh and delicious.  If you like sushi then you will LOVE this place.",

However upon closer inspection and digestion, I found that the Mexican part of the equation was lacking, severely. This is a burrito joint without flour tortillas! That would be like a burger place without any buns! Meats like Al Pastor, Adobada, and Carnitas were not offered. Mariscos were not included either. They didn't even give you the option of adding Tapatio or Valentina to your burrito, much less things like salsa verde, and roja. This is at best a Chipotle + Sushi combination.   The food is good, it's made well and the service is prompt, but I think the fusion especially the burrito part is a giant misnomer.",

I appreciate that they remember me :). 2 firecrackers (as is), build your own bowl and taro chips (furikake) to go.  In addition to being a creature of habit, I'm also kinda particular. I've never been disappointed here. They don't care that I don't want sauce and ask them to douse my bowl with straight sriracha. They happily add avocado, gently reminding me that it's an additional .50. Of course, guys and gals. I don't mind paying you extra for avo. They recently added diced mango to the list of toppings. Quinoa, too, but it's extra even if you don't get rice. I'd like to take this moment to suggest putting quinoa as an alternative to rice with no upcharge. I'm going grain free, guys. It's only another extra .50, but it's a small scoop and I gotta get my carbs somehow.   The ahi and salmon are always fresh and plentiful, as are the veggies. I've never had an issue with the fish. I've never had an issue with anything here. Burritos never seem to fall apart, even when stuffed full. There isn't much room to sit and typical times for the rushes are busy. The staff handles it.  I'm happy to report that it's still my go-to lunch spot in the area.",

I had two orders and asked the lady if I could get a free boba in regards to the promotion they have, she said \"no\" bc it had to be in same transaction. Then my other co worker who was paying after I did, bought two entrees and I asked her if he could get the free boba, she said \" no, I asked him and he said no.\" What kind of customer service is that, you should have at lease honor the free drink! We come here often as, we work in the car business. A lot of our colleagues always join us for lunch. I'm very disappointed in the way that lady who was ringing us up behaved. That's no way to have customer service, a small free drink boba, it's not like it's coming out of her paycheck. Very shocked! Other than that, the food is always amazing. I just didn't like how she was behaving and also, I didn't hear her tell the other couple she rang up for the free drink promotion you have going on. Great customer service will bring people back to your restaurant. Anyhow, thank you for your time. Have a great day!",

We ordered quite a bit and they didn't seem annoyed one bit (can't say that about the people behind us in line.)   You can order one of their specialties or build your own custom sushi burrito.   They have a lot of different options and toppings which is much appreciated.   I really liked their side bar with soy sauce, wasabi, etc.   They also gave a large variety of sides to choose from.  We got the furikake taro chips.   Good but a little hard to eat as the chips are very think.   The cheese sauce they come with is pretty good if not a little boring.   My problem was that the sushi burrito seemed pretty flavorless.  We tried the 3 amigos, angry tuna, a California, and a salmon bowl.   Of the 3 three salmon bowl had the most flavor (but we also still had to add quite a bit of soy sauce.)  I don't know if we'll be back.   We'll probably try quite a few more places first.",

    "text": "I love walking into this place. They literally shout when you walk-in, leave a tip, it's kind of my favorite thing. I'm not entirely sure if the staff is as into the greeting as they seem but that's a good thing! I love their shouting enthusiasm. I'm not always greeted as warm when they are building my bowl or sushi burrito but I will take what I can get. 90% of the time the guys and gals behind the glass genuinely ask how my day is going and that's a real nice thing to do.  They have quite a large amount of offerings from steak and tempura shrimp to chipotle mayo and queso. That's right. They have queso. I watched the guy ahead of me build his own bowl with steak, queso, and all the fixings. He was a genius. This time around I ordered myself the FIRECRACKER: Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Lettuce, Cabbage, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Honey. It's packed with flavor and wild with texture. I opted for the soy paper this time and it was quite nice. This was my favorite roll so far. I had the 3 Amigos last time and it wasn't my favorite.  The Taro Chips are a must. I love how crunchy they are and the three flavor options are nom-nom. My favorite is the furikake flavor and a major bonus is that is comes with a small side of queso for dipping. That's right, I said it again. Queso.  This is affordable, filling, and really delicious.",

I tried this place for the first time last year and then thought it was amazing and decided to try it again in my hometown, Washington DC. Man did they fail over here. Then I went to PokeWorks, and that was a fail too.   This place right here gives very generous portions of sushi so the fish to rice ratio is like 80/20. It's absolutely freakin' awesome! I took my friend's here for the first time and they were like I want to start a franchise! Lol  Anyway, real talk - this place is the spot for a quick sushi lunch, not to mention very affordable as well. I dislike how you can't order over the phone for a pickup though... please change that! (You can order online instead)",

I checked the 'spicy poke' as my main protein in the app but I BARELY even tasted it. It was more like a \"spicy imitation crab and seaweed bowl\" which by the way are considered add-ons.   I'm a bit flabbergasted by the glowing reviews of this place but then again, I probably should've went in myself. Also, this was one of the few poke options in Uber Eats.   For a bowl less than 10-bucks it raised an eyebrow and I wasn't expecting much. Compared to other poke bowls I've had in the area and beyond, this was by far the worst but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.",

    "text": "Sushirritos are apparently not a new idea, but I have never heard of it before. Sushi and a burrito all in one? I was intrigued. SoHo occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. The dining room is small and there are only a few tables. The first time I came here was around dinner time and the dining room was packed. There was nowhere to sit so my friend and I walked to the Mickey Dees and ate there. The last time I came in, around 7pm, there were a few open tables so my friends and I were able to eat there. I wish they had a bigger space so they could have more seating, but they are still new and Rome wasn't built in a day.   So how it works is you make your own bowl/burrito/salad/nachos, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I have tried a few signature items but I prefer to make my own. I almost always get a burrito on a seaweed wrap with fresh salmon, surimi crab, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo, unagi sauce and masago. This costs about $11 or so. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. You can get your items ala carte or upgrade to a combo that includes a drink and a side of your choice for a few bux more. Side options include edamame, miso soup and taro or tortilla chips with nacho cheese. The taro chips were surprisingly sweet, and went really well with the canned nacho cheese. I love sweet/savory combinations and this one was pretty good. Make sure to grab salsa/soy sauce/ginger/wasabi from the salsa bar.",

    "text": "After being quite the fan of Soho on 215/Jones for their happy hour, i knew I had to eventually come here to try one day, after finding out its by the same owner. The entrance/mall is under renovation but look for the SOHO sign in the middle of the building.   I came here for lunch when i had some extra time before my appointments on Sunday around 1230. Pretty busy, quite the few people in line. Set up reminds me of chipotle where you order and go down the line (if its not one of their pre-designed combinations). They have 11 \"predesigned\" combinations. If you don't like any of their pre-designed combinations, you can order by the process below  ----------------------------------  1- What do u like?? - Bowl, Nacho, Burrito (Seaweed Paper, Soy Paper, Flour Tortilla, Wheat Tortilla)   2 - How do u like it ?? - Burrito & Bowl (Sushi rice, Brown rice, White Rice, Mixed Greens - Bowl only), Nacho (Corn chips, House Made Taro Chips +$1.00)   3 - Add Proteins - Additional protein extra $1.50 Each  $5.50 - Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Sweet Omelet, Tofu $6.50 - Salmon, Grilled Chicken, Shrimp Tempura $7.50 - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Grilled Steak, Grilled Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Gardein Asada  4 - Splash Some Sauce  House Blend - Chedder Cheese Sauce, Creamy Cilantro, Honey Habenero, Mango Soy, Poke Sauce, Screaming \"O\", Sweet Chili, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Shiso Tormatillo, Unagi Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Yuzu Ponzu  Special Blend - GF/VG Chipotle Mayo, GF/VG Ponzu, GF/VG Sweet Chili, GF/VG Wasabi Aioli, VG Mango Soy, VG Unagi Sauce  GF = Gluten Free VG = Vegan   5 - Pick It... It's on Us !!! - Baby Spinach, Bell Pepper, Cabbage, Cilantro, Cucumber, Green Onion, Jalapeno, Lettuce, Mixed Greens, Pico de Gallo, Red Onion, Roasted Corn, Tomato, Crispy Wonton Strips, Tempura Crunch  Sorry... on you - Avocado, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Masago, Seaweed Salad   ---------------------------------------  Since this was my first time, decided to try one of their pre-designed ones. I had ordered the  3 Amigos which included Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, masago, crispy wonton strips, and wasabi aioli.   I also opted to get the house made taro chips as well as im a super fan of taro and oooh chips :D Lol   After adding a drink, i was a little short of $16. To be honest, when i paid, i was like oh man that was kinda pricey for a meal that doesn't look like will get me full...   3 Amigos is $10.95, Taro Chips is $1.99, and drink is $1.55. So no benefit on \"combo'ing\" if you dont want chips and/or drink.   The taro chips were flavored with some seasoning... If anything, it reminded me of like a sort of msg like seasoning you find on some chinese crackers and what not. Taro chips itself is great. Eating with the included \"nacho cheese\" is a bit weird of a combination  The 3 Amigos was pretty decent. I got pretty full (SURPRISINGLY). Cucumber gives it a nice freshness and crisp to the \"heavy\" tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. Masago is a nice touch with the \"popping\" but the most surprising thing was the crispy wonton strips. I didnt think id like the wonton strips but it surprisingly works well. Couldn't tell much of the wasabi aioli though. Overall, just tasted creamy? LOL xD   Overall, not bad. Maybe ill try to make my own thing next time.",

Walking in was a bit intimidating at first considering I have never been but the guys behind the counter are very helpful with selections from the menus. I opted for the Twin Dragon.  Which was a good choice in my opinion.   You have the opportunity to add some additional fresh toppings if you like. We made it into a meal so I got edamame and a drink they offered in the fridge next to the cash register.   All in all the food was delicious and it was a different way to eat sushi. I would maybe suggest making the seaweed a little longer so the bottom could be folded but I really didn't care when I took the first bite.",

The menu is a self explanatory and the items are extremely fresh. It's a surprising new twist on sushi at least to me I love burritos and I love sushi you  marry the 2 and you get SOHO. Beautiful experience near the strip. Atmosphere is good and you only feel good vibes in this place. Customer service was great and fast. Only draw back is the place is kinda small at our visit it was packed but some tables were empty but I'm sure at lunch time no room to sit. Outstanding place to get a bite to eat. I will definitely come back and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

I typically add lots of wasabi and some soy sauce to my sushi but these burritos are flavored so perfectly I didn't need to add a thing. IMPRESSIVE.   The ingredients are fresh and and even though it's busy they get things done quick!!!! The price is decent for how big these bad boys are as well.  I ordered the miso soup and it came from a machine and kind of freaked me out lol I wasn't a fan but it wasn't horrible either.   I AM DEFINITELY COMING BACK.",

Service was fast, we had two of the full size sushi burritos and it was far more than enough for two of us, I would order the smaller one next time.  Both orders were excellent.  I would describe it like a more awesome \"subway\" - Oder what you want, add what you like, this much of this sauce, that much of that one.  Would definitely return.  Line moves fast but it definitely lines up - we went around 11:30AM on Friday and were glad we beat the rush.",

The quality of the fish here is insanelyyy good. My favorite sushi burrito so far here would be the twin dragon. They also have an option of making your own sushi burrito or bowl. Location is a bit odd - it's right across Palace Station on Sahara/Las Vegas Blvd. I would expect this place to be in the same area as Soho Japanese Restaurant. Nevertheless , this is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner if you don't mind spending 9$-15$ on a meal (depending if you make it a combo or not). Will come back again !",

The triple S also missed on the tempura batter and not enough soft shell crab. But the worse part is you can't taste anything because of the jalapeno and spicy tuna overpowered everything else.

I got the triple S which had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, sweet chipotle mayo, and unagi sauce!! I underestimated the size of the burrito but it is such a big portion! You will be full. But of course my hunger took over and I ordered another burrito for a snack haha and I never do that!

It is \"Chipotle style\" where you go through a line and pick what you want in your burrito. After looking at their website and seeing GF sauces, I brought my friend who is celiac.   Well, the workers there weren't very allergen-friendly. Took multiple tries to get them to understand what gluten and soy are. They were not able to accommodate switching gloves and wiping down the work area either.   It wasn't until we got to the cashier that she took out a binder that had allergen info.   The allergen stuff was for my friend, while I could eat it safely. I got the salmon with sushi rice. It was pretty run of the mill, something I could make at home I felt. The burrito/roll machine was pretty neat though.",

The lady said ok, but I had to ask it several times for her to understand, English must have been her second language.  When my husband got there, they would not make it for him. We ended up getting a create your own for nearly nine dollars. We would have made this our weekly place for my daughter, but instead, my husband came home, very frustrated with the poor service.",

Same concept as a Chipotle restaurant...except with sushi. I can dig it!  There are options on the menu for \"pre-made\" burritos, bowls etc. if you prefer not to make your own custom creation.  What an array of sauces too! A lot of the more premium ingredients are 50 cents extra. I'd say you could easily spend $11 for one burrito, but that is the cost of most specialty rolls at a sushi bar anyway. :)  We will be back!

Not that Soho is bad, but they definitely added more of the Hispanic flavor into the newer menu. The burritos are good, but not as wonderful as the original menu. They've mentioned that they will still make anything from their old menu, but somewhere in between, they loss that pizzazz. Still good. Just not as great.",

I got the Twin Dragon, and though it might have been good, I couldn't get over the fact that it was super salty. I couldn't figure out if it was because of the seaweed salad I added, or the sauce, or maybe it was the spicy tuna or crab mix. Either way, it was just too salty. I couldn't enjoy my food.   Meanwhile, my friends really enjoyed their 3 Amigos. I regretted not getting it, but I also didn't want the wasabi aioli that was in it. In hind sight, I guess I could've gotten a different sauce with it.  My other friend went to the other location on Jones, and had the Twin Dragon and enjoyed it. I think I just had a bad batch. I will give it one more try before I completely dismiss this place. It doesn't seem like a bad place to eat. The food was fresh, service was quick, and workers were pretty friendly.   Based on the overall experience that I had, in collaboration with my friends, I won't say it was a complete disaster. I was comforted by the mochi ice cream, that was pretty delicious. Again I will give it another try soon.",

Prices are a bit steep and rolls are a little unevenly made but it's still good! One thing I would like to see in the future is the employees evenly dispersing the ingredients in the roll, not just in the middle. Awesome food and awesome staff!",

You don't understand how happy this makes me (,: the only problem is that this place is pretty far, literally next to palace station and the whole plaza is still being built but once it's built I think it'll do well. I tried the soho bowl, I put veggies, salmon and ahi with some special dressing on top. While my friend got the salmon burrito and both was like an foodgasm in my mouth omg they always use the freshest stuff and the quality is there you can just taste it in their food. Now to talk about how the inside looked; lemme tell you their floors looked so clean you can literally eat off it! There were enough seating, AND their bathroom was wonderfully clean. I completely enjoyed my visit here, and just like the other store they own, the customer service is ALWAYS on point! They never fail to satisfy all their customers. Definitely would recommend and probably going to bring all my friends here!",

The environment is great even for kids the menu is easy to see and best part is you can even build your own sushi burrito to your likings.

As soon as my wife and i walked in we were greeted with smiling faces welcoming us.  The setup reminds of subway,which is cool because you can see them ass they make it. It wasnt a long wait but oh yeah there were plenty of people deciding what to get and watching in awe how they expertly roll these beautiful sushi burritos. The place was very clean..small square tables make up the dinning area. When you get to the window,you can create your own or just choose any of the items off the menu. They have sushi bowls or burrito. I decided to try. 2 twin dragons full and 3 amigos..with seawood and reg white sushi rice(other options are available). My order was quite expensive but not unreasonable considering its sushi(fish, seafood). My order came up to $35.00. When you are paying for you meal,they print up options to as to what to tip according to your order,not mandatory but you kind of feel like you have too. Not that the employees dont deserve it. I was excited so i decided to eat a half in store. They have a salad bar which consist of. All sushi fixings;ginger,wasabi,soy sauce etc. The full size burritos are not huge but its enough for an adult. They pre cut in half for you. Took my first bite i was in heaven. It taste just like sushi in burrito with all the flavors complimenting eachother. Some of my filling did come out but thats to be expected but the seaweed wrap held up. I do find that if you go homw and put in the freezer for a bit ,it holds better when eaten. Great experience,great food,happy atmosphere but a bit pricey. You would want to eat here everyday but the price will stop you lmaooo",

We went there around 1:30pm which is not considered peak hours for this restaurant, so the assumption was that it would be quick and without hassle. The employee that took our orders was awesome- really nice and smiled the whole time. The service until the checkout was efficient and satisfactory. When we arrived to the checkout, the cashier was pretty rude and condescending. The couple in front of us had happened to order the same thing and when the cashier asked them if this was their order, there was slight hesitation and confusion on their end so I said I think that's ours. The cashier replied with a snide remark about how everything was in order and they were here first...until the next 3 orders were out of order. Also, my boyfriend asked twice if the beer he ordered was included on the bill (it wasn't) and when he told us the total, he asked again if the beer was included (still wasn't) until he said, ''that's with the beer, right?' Just be a little more respectful to your customers and next time it'll be 5 stars!",

I arrived around 2 and the restaurant was not busy, just a few customers. One of the employees offered to explain the menu since it was my very first time which I was appreciative of because he really broke it down to an easy understanding. I ordered the Twin Dragon with chips and Japanese Millen soda. The whole meal just blew me away. The flavor was intense extremely fresh fish the chips you can tell were home made and taste like they are made with natural ingredients. The melon soda I read on the back is made with evaporated milk and it is so unique and fresh I can see myself buying a case if I ever found it in stores. I ended up going back a second time and bring a friend with me. This second time  I ordered the Triple-S  it was very good but I prefer the Twin Dragon instead .  I plan to try all of the sushi burritos that they have to offer . I do not discriminate ;) She agreed that Sushi Burrito needs a Golden Globe award or something of the sort. The atmosphere is great and I was very pleased to find an outlet near table so I was able to charge my phone that was on 3%. That was my hero. Their work stations always look clean and organized so I have great confidence to eat there over and over again.  Do I recommend this restaurant hell yeah I do and I plan to be back very very soon.",

I am neither sexist nor racist (I'm a gay man married to a Korean man), but the Asian women behind the counter taking the orders assembly-line style spoke in such high-pitched, loud voices and so fast that I had to ask them to repeat everything more than once.

You almost can't go wrong with any of the protein choices, but make sure you get cucumber and top it off with tempura bits for that perfect crunch at the end!!",

    "text": "Okay, I'm not going to lie, I went here at least once a week while I was here on business for a month. LET. ME.TELL.YOU! I thought the idea of sushi+burritos= awesome, and this place never disappointed.   The first two times that I went, I created my own. The spicy tuna is ACTUALLY SPICY! Not burn you mouth off kind, but a little bit more than a buffalo sauce gives off. Definitely a good mix with the shrimp tempura or fresh salmon :)   The next two times I went I got the taro chips with cheese sauce and the umami burrito! They were finally offering eel and it quickly became my favorite thing! I will say the price is a bit steep on that roll ($11 something for the roll ) but it by far had some of the best and most kick butt flavors I've ever had.  My concerns going into this place was the same I get with every burrito, it's going to get too big and soggy and just be a ball of mush at the end. I did not run into that problem here. They have a machine that tightens the rolls for them and it certainly helped! It's not overpowering or mushy. just great flavors and fun ambiance.   When you think about it, you're gonna spend about $15-$20 on 2-3 8pc rolls, without a drink. This place will run you about $8-10 without a drink and fills you up more.  Taro chips were okay, not one thing I need to get again though.",

I come here pretty often and have for the last year or so - twice a month at the least but usually more. I've got quite the appetite as I usually don't get the chance to eat during the day, so I like to get 3 or 4 servings of fish.   The problem? Apparently knowing how to count isn't exactly common sense anymore. One serving is three scoops, so if I order quadruple, I should end up with twelve, yeah? Nope, not here. I have to mention it literally every single time. You get charged extra for extra fish, which is completely fine - just give me what you're charging me for. Not a huge deal, but over the last year and easily 30+ visits, they've probably only done it right the first time once or twice.  Don't mean to rag on this place too hard cause it really is great otherwise - friendly employees, excellent quality food, and it's stupidly affordable. Strongly recommend, but seriously, learn to count.",

I went at 2PM on a Saturday, and there was still a long line for their delicious food (though the line moves quickly).. You are allowed a choice between soy paper or seaweed paper topped with a layer of sticky rice.  You can then pick individual ingredients (Chipotle style), or you can ask for a premade combination.  Picking individual ingredients can get complicated if you are unfamiliar, so I just opted to go with premade.  I tried the high maintenance and the 3 amigos, both of which were tasty.  I think the high maintenance had more flavor, but the 3 amigos had more quantity of fresh fish.  The masago was also yummy.  The portion is perfect and the food is healthy.  Someone else had accidentally picked up my friend's burrito at the end of the line, so that my friend ended up with the wrong burrito.  When my friend brought it up to the cashier, they apologized and made him the right one immediately (while letting him keep the wrong order). I thought that this was professional and nice.  Loved this place. Highly recommend. Would return!",

However haven't ordered a bowl yet cause I'm still getting through all the sushi burritos. Even better they said they may be opening one near me in the Southwest area! Seriously will be there weekly, so good!!  Fast, friendly and super delicious. It gets pretty crowded so go early. Last time we went and got it to go and I pretty much inhaled it!",

I was scared that it wouldn't be appealing so I also bought a sandwich from Subway, but I ended up giving that away! I had the Twin Dragon Roll with avocado instead of guacamole and it was delicious! We ended up splitting it because we only got one in fear that neither of us would like it. There was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and crabmeat inside of it with some vegetables and sauces. It was literally my favorite roll as a burrito.   I will definitely go back when I return to visit family!",

I  made my own burrito with seaweed as the outside and they have a fancy machine that perfectly places sushi rice nice and flat so you can get the maximum toppings loaded up! Losts of proteins and veges available.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING TEMPURA CRUNCH FLAKES ADDED. This added an incredibly crunchy texture that you may not normally experience on a sushi roll.  They don't skimp AT ALL. That burrito was amazing and busting at the seems.  * they also serve bowls and side items like edamame and miso soup",

The place was very inviting and surprisingly not that busy (every time I've gone there's a line out the door). The first guy that built my burrito was very helpful with choosing what sauce will suit the burrito I got. I'm so glad I didn't end up only getting poke sauce.  Overall, a MUST TRY in Vegas. They also have bowls and nachos available.",

It had soft shell crab and spicy tuna (which I subbed for salmon for an additional 50 cents.) i requested light sauce for both but kinda wish I had more sauce bc it tasted a little bland but I didn't wanna overdo my calories. You can also build your own burrito or bowl ( concept is similar to chipotle) and choose your protein, veg, white/brown rice, etc. comes out to about 10-15per burrito depending on how extravagant you want to get.   Also, the person who docked stars from this restaurant because they didn't serve corn or flour tortillas should really reconsider their review. Why would u put sushi and japanese ingredients in a corn or flour tortilla (aka diabetes wrap) when you can use healthy premium ingredients like seaweed or soy paper?",

After I walked in with my girlfriend we were greeted with a loud \"SOHOOOO\".  I felt like I just stepped into a sushi restaurant, immediately I felt welcome.    After walking inside you'll see the station where you order your food, and where they make it.  Up above is a full menu of pre-made burritos and also your option to build your own.  After going through reviews on Yelp, I decided to go with the Twin Dragon burrito, with everything.  It literally took like 3 minutes for them to make the burrito!    Twin Dragon - The flavor is definitely there, it's so tasty.  The added won ton chips (I think) add texture to the burrito, and the seaweed wrap and sushi rice make it even more enjoyable.  A bit on the messy side close to the ends of the burrito but nothing a good ol' fork can't take care of.  The fish tasted very fresh, and I would love to come back to try the other pre-made creations.",

The sushi Burritos/bowls are SO good (really tasty), but now that they don't carry the taro chips, that makes me SO sad and is why I'm rating with 3 stars.  I would give 5 stars, but honestly the taro chips, especially the cheddar flavor, made them stand out from the other sushi burrito places. They've replaced with regular nacho chips. Same cheese, different chips.  They have other choices on their menu like miso soup, Mochi ice cream, boba tea, and a couple other things. You can do a combo with a drink.  You can make your own burrito/bowl or select one of their suggested ones. My favorite is the High Maintenance or 3 Amigos.  To whomever owns SOHO Burrito: PLEASE bring the taro chips back in all flavors. Those were so good. I LOVE them!",

Food...Biult my own Bowl..quinoa was a great selection along with all the other fix ins.  Protein..the spicy tuna was a good amount, Ahi Tuna not so much but it was good quality. So maybe that's the trade off. I did add tofu and that was well just tofu. Probably do more tuna next time. Fix ins...I added alot and it made for a very full bowl. Sauces...big hit was the Wasabi and the Poke sauce was a close second.  I will definitely go back, or use GrubHub again for another Poke Bowl!",

I was pleasantly surprised because the bowl was incredibly good. It was a mix of ahi tuna, soft shell crab, a couple handfuls of cucumbers, crispy wonton strips, roasted corn, red onions, and mixed greens. I would definitely recommend the Triple \"S\", the 3amigos, and the High Maintenance.   Thank you to Angelica, Karl, George, and Christina specifically for this visit :-) I also want to thank Justin, Kim, Tim and Dennis for my other visits because they make everything 11/10.

This place is not too far from the strip so if you want some cheaper sushi, I highly recommend checking out this place. I mean, if you really can't get away from the casino, it's not too far from Palace. Anyways, the inside was clean with enough seating area. You go up to the counter and order.   I had the 3 Amigos which contained three different fishes (ahi tuna, yellowtail, and salmon). I thought the portion of fishes was good and I didn't feel like the portion of rice was significantly greater. It wasn't overly salty or saucy which I prefer because I like the taste of the raw fish. My boyfriend got the Twin Dragon which was decent. It was a little too creamy for my taste.   Our burritos were wrapped in tightly so I didn't have trouble eating them. Come check out this place if you're in the area!",

I hate the fact that the entire shopping center is under construction right now, but this does not take away from how awesome SOHO is. I expected this place to be amazing simply because the mother restaurant has never disappointed , and neither did the sushi burrito! With multiple designed burritos and the option to build your own this place has unlimited potential. They even have something for the non fish lover... very well done SOHO!",

Then get it filled with delicious fresh sushi goodness such as spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, tobiko, grilled salmon, cucumber, avocado or other non-traditional sushi toppings such as pico de gallo, chipotle mayo, tomatillo sauce and guacamole.  They really cram these sushi burritos full of stuff, no skimping going on here.  There are small portion and appropriately priced sides like seaweed salad, edamame and bags of seasoned taro chips.  Flavors are bold and ingredients are fresh. Nothing on the menu has disappointed. The Twin Dragon is particularly good, but if you don't fancy one of the menu options you can get creative and build your own.  Just about the perfect fast-casual lunch spot. Once you try this you may have a hard time going back to Chipotle. Addictive, but thankfully light on the wallet.  More locations please. Summerlin needs sushi burrito love too!",

You are able to order half sizes if you prefer. The portion is enough to share in my opinion and leave you satisfied. I ordered a whole one but ate half and was satisfied.

Angry tuna, made me sad, it wasn't spicy at all, and the tuna was poorly cut. The chunks were just too big. The bowl itself was full of fresh ingredients and i kinda liked all except the tuna, which should have been the star of the dish.  Sorry, 3 stars for creativity :)",

Good, don't go so the lines won't be as long when I do.   I really do like this place. The fish quality is pretty good; I've not had anything that tastes fishy, just fresh. What really is amazing is the amount of food you get for the dollar. A $10 Twin Dragon and I am almost uncomfortably full.   My favorites are the Angry Tuna and Twin Dragon. Also, pro tip, get the soy paper as it makes the burrito easier to eat. You can make a big thick cut sushi roll with nori, but it's too chewy/stretchy for me.   Now that the facade construction is mostly finished this place has gotten busy again, so please be put off by my review so I can eat here more often. Cheers!",

The nori was a bit tough to bite through however.   The combination of my ingredients was essentially a salmon, avocado, cuc roll with some wasabi aioli (? I think that's what it was), with krab and lettuce. I would get it again!   I was told the high maintenance was good but very filling.   The menu is a little overwhelming and there's little room to stall once you're up to order, so make sure you know what you want before jumping into line.   One point of contention for me was the salmon. It looked very pale. I wish I would have asked more to learned about where its from and how it's raised. If the owners see this I'd love to hear about it.  Thanks for offering a quick way to grab a nutritious bite quite for reasonable amount of sheckles.",

    "text": "This was an awesome visit. The sushi burritos are way larger than I expected. We ordered the 3 Amigos and Caterpillar roll and both were good. When I asked for no green onions on the Caterpillar roll they actually asked me if I wanted to substitute an ingredient for it and suggested masago. I think that was super cool because at other restaurants they would never have done this.   I also really like the idea of building your own burrito from scratch. If I came a few more times I definitely would give that a try as the combinations would be endless. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place after being in NYC and realizing the sushi-rrito is a revolution happening right now across the USA. Couldn't believe we had these places in Vegas, so as soon as I got off the plane from my vacation on the east coast I had to check this spot out.  I got a custom salmon/eel/avocado roll with some of my favorites added. The roll was fat (I like a LOT of sushi lol), and for about $10 filled me up a lot more than $10 at a typical sushi joint!  The fish was very fresh tasting, all ingredients were on point. My only complain is I wish this place was my next door neighbor I could get freebies at once a week =)  You NEED to try this place at least once. You won't regret it, if you do you may not have a sushi soul.",

    "text": "After a full day of shopping my friends had recommended I try Soho Sushi for their famous burrito. The idea intrigued me because, all sushi rolls are basically burritos- accept it's served cut up, so why not.   The concept of Soho Sushi Burrito is like, Chipotle, Subway, Panda Express, etc... the pick and point, build-your-own burrito or bowl concept. They do have menu items that are already made otherwise you get to build your own the way you want it! Super customizable.  There's many options to chose from. Although it's slightly overwhelming your first time, the workers here are super helpful and patient - so they'll walk you through the process easy.   I recommend the sushi burrito, of course! For your protein, you gotta get the spicy tuna - especially if you love hot sauce like myself. There's a huge spicy kick upon first bite, be cool! I loved it! From their let the customizing begin. They have a ton of different veggies options and sauces. Again, for the spicy lover in you, opt for the honey habanero! Bomb!   They are running a cool deal right now where of you purchase two main items you can receive a free boba drink. If so, get the Taro flavor! Super good without being too sweet! Enjoy!",

Now, let me say this before you think this is just a biased opinion because I love their mother restaurant. I am not a poke burrito or poke chipotle style bowl fan. In fact, I don't ever order a burrito. The only poke spot I actually fux with in Las Vegas is Poke Express because it's simple, fresh, straight up Hawaiian style Poke.   I love the bowls I get here at Soho because I am able to control what they put in so I can make it as simple or as extra as I want. The major thing that got me coming back of course is the fish freshness and perfect cubed cuts. Some poke bowl spots fish pieces are too big and unbearable to masticate as well as fishy tasting. Anyway, I will definitely be here at least once a week, and I'm already excited for my trip there this week haha.",

My girlfriend and I were leaving Las Vegas and this was the last restaurant we wanted to try before heading back to California. I don't know why this food place has high review ratings considering what we ordered definitely wasn't 4 and a half stars.  Food: First and foremost, I've had plenty of other poke bowls in my life, some in the inland empire, some in Hawaii, some in San Diego, and this place isn't on par with those. My girlfriend got the caterpillar (with no cream cheese) and I got the BYO. I do like that they have vegetarian options because I've never seen that at other poke bowl places. I opted for the tuna and the gardein steak with a bunch of other stuff. I strongly believe that the sauce is what made the bowl tasty. I opted for sesame soy and gochujang.  Service: Service was average. No complaints from here!  Overall, I've had better poke bowls in my lifetime and this place is really average compared to those. It was good for the price and the bowl was filling, but we probably won't be coming back with all these other fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Soho Sushi Burrito is located in the same plaza as Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ, Subway and McDonald's. Soho Sushi Burrito is located specifically next door to Red Wing with plenty of parking spots available.  My husband and I came by here last Saturday around 1:15 pm for lunch. After browsing the menu board, we ended up getting:  Build Your Own Poke Bowl With Ahi Tuna, $7.95 prior to tax- The way the build your own bowls work is that you pay for the bowl based on the price of whatever protein you choose. If you want to get a 2nd protein, you pay for the most expensive and then an additional $1.50 for the 2nd protein. I opted for my bowl to be made with half brown rice, half salad. I got all of the free add ins that are not spicy (I don't do spicy). I thought my bowl was hearty and filling. I liked the creamy sesame dressing (I requested for a light amount in my bowl). The ahi tuna was fresh tasting.  North Shore Poke Bowl, $7.50 prior to tax- My husband opted for one of the premade bowls. I should have asked the employee behind the counter to add salad to his bowl to be a bit more filling and round it out with some more fiber. I got this bowl for my husband to be made with brow rice (you have the option to have this made with white rice or salad or do a mix like my made your own bowl). My husband liked the fresh flavors of the fish in his bowl.   Taro Milk Tea, $3 prior to tax- This restaurant now offers milk tea, with an option to add boba for an additional $0.50. Unfortunately because these drinks are premade, sweetness level is not able to be adjusted. Only added ice can be added to help dilute the sweetness. My husband got this drink but it was a little on the sweet side.   Lychee Green Tea, $3 prior to tax- I opted for this tea drink. I also thought it was on the sweet side and so I just added water to my drink to lower the sweetness level. I felt this drink was refreshing and a great price.  ----------------------- (Total= $23.22 after tax)  Service was friendly. WiFi was available and was fast for those surfing the net. The restroom in the back was clean and adequately stocked with the essentials.   Overall, we had a great lunch experience and would come back here again if I lived in the area.",

    "text": "Overall, I'd say this is an ok sushi burrito place, definitely not in my upper tier but not terrible. I had the three amigos wrap, which came with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. The fish quality didn't really impress me--it is True that in general sushi burrito places don't have the same quality of fish as sushi joints, but this one stood out as being on the weaker end, quality-wise. Prices were a bit above average.   The service is, as others have indicated, very friendly, which is nice. It gets it to a 3.5 star experience, but realistically, I would be inclined to choose several other sushi burrito places over this one given the option.",

This place greets you as you enter so if you aren't paying attention you might get scared and enter your most intimidating ninja stance possible.  VEGGIE BURRITOS. -- so there's that... if anyone was wondering. I absolutely love veggies wrapped in other veggies drizzled in sauces and it kind of makes you wonder why you can't just make this at home?! It's so good!... because- no.. it tastes better if someone else makes it, that's why.  The price here is surprisingly low so.. live a little.. buy two burritos or try them all!  I do know that I'll be back to try a few other veggie selections that they have.. in the mean time I will be on the hunt for an ice cream spot.. cookies n cream!!",

Mmmm NOT FRESH, NOT IMPRESSED! I thought they had the order wrong but they said no, that's the way the ahi sushi bowl comes. So, don't expect fresh ahi steak Tuna or Yellow tail. The one star was for the cold cuts and rice. Only thing is the Edamame and soup was also cold. So, don't bother with instructions, they can't read or more to the point THEY don't care. So, If you want a burrito you will get better meat at taco smell! Enjoy! No refunds!",

Is it supposed to be that way? It seemed like it had been cooked hours ago, was cold, oily, chewy, rubbery, no bueno. Cuz ive never been served cold tempura ever before at any sushi place! Eh, I usually get spicy tuna anyways, so 1 bad burrit won't change my mind. Other than that, this place is fab. My fave out of all the sushi burrito joints. I like all the sauce options and how they're not skimpy with their scoops. I want to try a bowl, but I always manage to make up a burrito every time I go in. Staff is always super nice too.",

The guy responds, \"chicken with teriyaki sauce\". Like.... no duh.... So I said \"It doesn't come with rice?\" and he said \"yes it does\" so I said \"can I get vegetables instead?\"  he said \"yes or brown rice\". So I told him I wanted brown rice with vegetables. He gives me half brown rice and half leaves! I was hoping for like steamed veggies such as broccoli and cauliflower, but I got a salad. But whatever, at least I got some greens. Then my bowl is handed to the girl who puts on the sauce. And I am not sure if this is just me, but I do not like my rice drenched in sauce. That is exactly what she did. I sat down with my food tried to eat it but I could not because i was just basically drinking teriyaki sauce and it was disgusting. I was eating leaves dripping in teriyaki sauce with rice that is soaked in teriyaki. In the end I wasted $7 because it was so bad I just threw it away. Long story short, I'll be sticking with Panda Express.",

In the mood for sushi wrap, they can give me a tortilla instead. The rice, fish, and everything else on the sushi burritos are excellent.  This place is fast becoming one of my preferred lunch stops when I'm in that part of town.",

The meal itself is delicious! it tastes fresh and is quite filling even though it doesn't seem like it would be. The only thing that is bothersome is the price. For this meal it was around $30. That is pricey. Also, the place is small. Therefore it's very noisy & hard to find a seat. I'm not sure I would come back because of the price... but it's definitely worth trying!!",

Now I will have to return at least three times a week, but it is good to take the kids to the Student Union at the University of Nevada Las Vegas so that they can feel like college students studying over the summer. The place was packed with students taking courses over the summer. Nice air conditioning, clean, plus the new housing units have a pool and court yard in the center like a resort casino. Rooms have views of the outside looking out at the university and inside staring down at the swimming pool that in this heat students will be able to use the swimming pool 12 months out of the year to study and swim by the pool. I wish my college had a 365 day seasonal heated swimming pool. I studied at SFSU, where Mark Twain was known to have said, \"The coldest winter I ever spent was the summer in San Francisco, California.\"",

Beyond that we had nothing to do so we sat for a few hours and caught up on general conversation and were not given any issues about leaving. Overall I was satisfied and will be back.",

It looked a bit suspect as the store front was under construction, but when you entered the store, it was nice and clean, packed with people enjoying the food.  I made my way to the counter where they greeted me and told me how to order.  Very similar to all the build your own sandwich/burrito places, but with sushi ingredients!!  I made my own burrito with Nori, Tempura Shrimp, Crab Salad, Seaweed Salad, Cabbage, Cucumbers, Unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and tempura crunches, not to forget the Sushi Rice.  They wrap up the burrito nicely, pretty much like a giant sushi roll.    It was great! Very tasty, and the sauce recommendation was on point.  Just keep in mind, nori is a lil tough to bite on, so it may get a little messy, but I enjoyed nonetheless.  I may try a soy paper version next time.    Try this place, you'll love it, and will want to share with your friends as well.  I'll be going back to get a burrito to take home with me.",

I admit, the price runs on the higher side, but I think it's completely worth it! Definitely recommended!",

    "text": "Like so many people I'd bet you never even heard of a sushi burrito and had trouble with the concept.  But I went with my girlfriend who promised me I would love it.  I love sushi and burritos so what could go wrong?  NOTHING!  While she ordered a design it yourself burrito, I went with one of the predesigned one.  Just watching them make them was interesting with two machines, one seems to prepare the wrapper and the other once completed tightens up the roll.  I loved the crunch from the wonton strips and the sauces and combination was excellent and I brought some home for lunch the next day and it was still good. Service was friendly and quick, the place seemed clean but the only issue I had was the ding area seemed cheaply designed and the chairs were uncomfortable.  But I didn't go to sit and relax but to order a delicious and unique food.  I was not disappointed.",

My raw salmon was drenched in ponzu sauce which made the burrito sour and I could not taste the salmon at all. I also think there are too much selection of sauces and ingredients which makes it very easy to put the wrong things together and make a poke burrito taste odd.",

The line was pretty long at 1pm on a Thursday but it moved quickly.  I ordered the Triple S, which has Shell Crab, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Red Onion, Jalapeno, Cucumber, Tempura Crunch, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Unagi Sauce, I had it wrapped in nori (seaweed wrap) and added the yuzu guacamole.  It was so Ono (yummy), packed with lots of flavor, however next time I'll have it in soy paper because it was a little hard to bite a piece of the burrito because the nori was a little tough.  We also got the kids California burrito, seaweed salad and the taro chips, it was so good!  The only negative is the lack of space because it was a little cramped w/ 2 mamas and 3 of our kiddos.  Overall I would definitely come back and just get these delicious sushi burritos to go and chill out at the park w/ my kiddos.",

I also love their other restaurant Soho Sushi. In my mind Soho SushiBurrito had all the potential in the world but they fell short, way short. It may be that I have already decided exactly how the perfect Sushi Burrito should taste, and the options were too far from what I'm used to. Maybe it was that I felt the quality of the ingredients were not the same quality as their other store. Maybe it was a combination of the two but I feel the taste and quality were lacking.  I will admit, I may be a one off because even during construction going on at the strip mall they were packed with people who all seemed to be enjoying themselves. I will probably give them another chance because I really wanted to love it but at this point the review is of disappointment.",

Initially it wasn't what I originally wanted to try today but being a national holiday a few place was closed so my sister and I went on Yelp and stumble across this place and remembered a few of my co-workers & friends mentioned about this place.   As you walk in this simple and modern setup of a fusion Japanese & Mexican restaurant with a BYO-Build Your Own Concept. You'll notice the Maneki-Neko (Japanese Cats Figurines) which is seen throughout the establishment with Sombreros hanged on the walls. We were greeted by the friendly staff and a guy approach us to ask if it was our first time here. He was very helpful and patient with us. We ended up getting their Twin Dragon Bowl & 3Amigos Bowl. Got a bag of Taro Chip-Cheddar Cheese Flavor with Cheddar Cheese dipping sauce. (Highly recommend the Taro Chip-simply delicious!). Our bowls was very consistent and filling and the fish was very fresh. Especially the Ahi Tuna and Salmon. Then again, I'm biased with Tuna and Salmon but I do enjoy Yellowtail too which is why I chose the 3Amigos because Tuna, Salmon & Yellowtail is my fish of choice whenever I'm having Sushi. We didn't try their Sushi Burrito but will indeed come back to try more of their items.",

The lady on the phone confirmed that they knew what the Sunset bowl was and it was available. My coworker went to order food and was told they did not know what it was. After reading the menu description from the other location over the phone to them they delivered a bowl that was a quarter of the way filled with rice and a very small amount of fish.   I will continue to go to the Badura location, but will avoid the Sahara location from now on.",

I remember it was an all tuna burrito) but after trying my friends' burritos, next time I would order one of their's. One got the firecracker tuna and it had the right amount spice that made it flavorful and a reasonable kick. My other friend got the dynamite burrito (it had crab and shrimp tempura) and I loved the warmth the shrimp tempura provided in contrast to the cold ingredients.  My burrito was nearly falling apart! It was packed with goods.   If you are going with a large group, don't go during the heart of lunch time. Seating was limited, but we also went on a Saturday afternoon.",

Parking was plentiful.  In fact, we were able to find parking right in front of the Subway that was right next door.   In addition to finding this place close by, I was able to view the menu online AND I was able to order online.  I paid online too.  I ordered exactly what I wanted, how I wanted it.  It was great.  I ordered a sushi'rito bowl.  I practically ordered whatever fish they had on the menu, like salmon, tuna, yellowtail, unagi and crab. You can choose whatever protein you want and whatever rice you want.  You get so many options.  I think my eyes got really big when I kept clicking on the items. I ordered all kinds of toppings also.  My bowl was huge.  I was extremely full after eating my meal.  It doesn't sound filling but it definitely is.  After all, this was my lunch and I was still full as dinner passed by.  My only gripe is that of course, after your eyes are big and your stomach is hungry and you went click happy on all the options, everything has a steep price.  I didn't end up spending a lot because I was out of town and I wanted to try everything in one sweep.  Yes, this did cost me quite a bit more had I just gone with a traditional option. Just be aware of that if you choose the build your own option. Be mindful of your wallet not only your craving.  The service was friendly and they treated you more than just a customer.  If you didn't know what to order they were more than willing to help you out and give you suggestions based on whatever you were craving at the time.  They have specialty items available too if you don't want to make your own. This is helpful for those of us whom can't make a decision.    If in the area, I would totally come back.",

Then when I asked about what kind of sauce/dressing they had one of the employee was like look up on the menu.  The reason I give 5 stars is because the burrito is good not for the service.

Overpriced and such small portions when you compare it to other customizable quick service restaurants (Chipotle, any of the personalized pizza places). That being said, all of them for the most part have excellent food.  I normally make my own bowl and that's exactly what I did. I usually get sushi rice, salmon, ahi tuna, and yellowtail. The difference here was the honey habanero which is a solid sauce and compliments the wasabi aoili well. Then I get the cucumber for that freshness, furikake for that extra flavor on the rice, and avacado & tempura crunch for texture and more flavor.   Like I mentioned earlier...excellent food but overpriced for the portions you are getting. When you have so many options with all these sushiburrito places opening up and your paying $9-12 on a bowl or burrito you can easily go to chipotle and get more food for less...",

My item was the firecracker bowl and I customized it to add baby spinach, mixed greens, pico, tempura crunch and guacamole ($.50). So I picked up my order and was excited to eat my bowl and I saw the ticket order taped to it. But once I opened the bowl up none of my added items were in the bowl!!!! No guacamole that I paid extra for. No greens, spinach, pico, or tempura crunch. I was kinda disappointed because I placed an online order clearly stating what I wanted in my bowl and none of that made it in there. It was still good nonetheless but I still wanted my items added in there.   But in my moms bowl order the Santa Fe they got every single customized item in there so that seems like they just over looked my order still kinda disappointing.   Don't think I'll be back there.",

It comes with ahi tuna, salmon, and yellowtail with Wasabi aioli dressing. The fish always taste fresh and their portion is generous. I usually order the bowl version and it's enough for both lunch and dinner for me. I wish they didn't charge extra for seaweed salad or avocado like sweet poke. If you come here for lunch, either come for an early lunch or for a late lunch because they get quite busy and the place is small, so seatings are limited. If you're not into raw fish, they offer sushi burritos with cooked proteins like grilled salmon or chicken. My coworkers really enjoy the Cheesy Asada, which comes with grilled steak.",

It was filled full of fresh goodness consisting of yellowtail, spicy tuna, red onion, guac, lettuce, cilantro, wonton strips and creamy cilantro sauce. It was so light and refreshing I probably could have eaten two. Taro chips n warm cheese sauce were addictive. I will definitely be back when I'm in town again.",

This place is awesome..it is CHIPOTLE with sushi ingredients..you can ask for the menu burritos ranging from soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and so forth. The menu are for people who cant decide what to put in it. You can omit items also..like i get TRIPLE S no jalapenos..but your feeling adventurous. .you can build your own.  You can order them as a burrito (seaweed or soy), nachos,  bowl, or the boring tortilla.  Plus they have a condiment station at end of line..wasabi, soy sauce (shoyu for us hawaiians), pickled ginger, and other things that make accompany sushi. During lunch line is long be prepared to be inline for 30 mins..but its worth the wait. Oh and the trick to eating it is keep it in the paper while your eating it so the ingredients dont fall out!",

If you're thinking about calling ahead to order, don't even sweat! They don't answer the phones because they're too busy fulfilling orders and everyone is super fast, trying to get to the next one.  I ordered the 3Amigos on Seaweed, but I sub the white rice to a brown one. Despite the addition of Jalapenos and replacing the Wasabi Aioli with Chipotle Mayo, it's still not spicy enough for me. I'll probably try a different variation next time I go.  You can also order online, which is pretty convenient. I just don't know how long it's gonna take to get everything ready as each one has at least 10 per receipt.",

The line was so long when I came with a friend on Thursday night!  When you go you can get combos either in a bowl or burrito. They also give you the option of seaweed or soy paper. I chose to get the burrito since that seemed to be the most popular. I went with the high maintenance without red onions. I added grilled corn and spinach ( trying to be healthy you know) and added the wasabi aioli as well. Instead of Guac... Which I thought it was kind of weird, they were able to substitute it with avocado instead.   The burrito had yellowtail and spicy tuna. It was so good!  I thought the fish was really fresh and loved all taste of the combo together. I really didn't taste the wasabi but the combo of the wasabi aioli and cilantro dressing paired with the fish really well.   I would definitely go back and try other combinations and the highly recommended taro chips!",

The fish was fresh and the salsa was as well.  Both were delicious and very filling!! I could easily share one \"burrito\" and be full, well for a little bit at least . We ordered the housemade taro chips as well and they were crisp and seasoned with a jalepeno type flavor ! So so good ! Great spot , average price but you get a ton of food . Place fills up fast but it'a no wonder !!",

    "text": "If I was to make one recommendation it would be to NOT customize your own sushiritto. Stick with the ones on the menu! The one you make will not be as tasty and delicious as the preset ones on the menu. Choose the type of protein you prefer and look through the other items that come along with the option you chose. You have the option to tell them to leave out certain items and add certain items. It works similar to Chipotle, but with raw fish and Japanese/Mexican additions. Very new idea that has become extremely popular amongst the students at UNLV because it is fun and mainly because of its proximity to the school. It is kind of difficult to find as it blends in with all the local shops amidst the construction in the lot. Just look for the sign that reads SoHo. I would say give it a try if you've never tried it before. While you're at it, grab a side of taro chips. They are quite tasty :9",

Onions were overpowering and the sauce was similar to teriyaki so it didn't blow me a way like I thought. The concept is original but not something I would go to everyday. It is ridiculously expensive for a burrito and a drink ($12) Thats half of AYCE in most places, if not more during AYCE lunch specials! I wouldn't try it honestly.

The restaurant is very clean, the company uses a lot of cool recyclable items, and offers a variety of sushi burritos. I love having the Twin Dragon and looking to try the other burritos sometime.   While the name has changed, the service is still great and the burritos still taste the same. In comparison to Sushirrito's prices and size, they are practically the same and well worth the money. I always get full from just eating a sushi burrito. Also, if you love mochi, well they have mochi!   Overall this place is great and I recommend eating here if you're ever in Vegas and craving a sushi burrito.",

I recommend: Everything is good, but my absolute favorite is Sunny Salmon with Twin Dragon and Triple S after that; taro chips with cheese; new spam musubi burrito!  I LOVE this place. Love it. I crave it regularly. I bring my friends from out of town here. I tell so many people about this place. It's just so great. I've been a fan since their \"Jaburritos\" days and although they tweaked the recipes a tiny bit, it's still absolutely fantastic.   For the price, the portion is absolutely huge. Think about it- a sushi roll at an average sushi restaurant is at least $10... For that price, you could have a JUMBO roll in sushi burrito form! They aren't skimpy when they're making your burrito either. They want you to be happy!  The service here is so friendly and polite. They do write which burrito is which once it is wrapped so no need to worry if you're ordering multiples. I haven't made my own burrito yet because I like the \"premade\" ones so much. The new spam musubi burrito is amazing as well. Don't forget to order some taro chips at the register!   I have nothing negative to say about their food and service. They have something for everyone (if you don't like fish, they have meat or a tofu/veggie option; if you don't like seaweed, they have a soy wrap option, etc etc). This place is amazing and if you like sushi and you haven't hit this place up yet, you are missing out- plain and simple.",

The concept of this place alone makes for an interesting restaurant but this is more of a \"fast food\" / Port of Subs kind of deal. (Still amazing!!!) This was my first time eating their food and I chose the Twin Dragon (although you can custom make your own roll/bowl) this was better than actual sushi rolls. It had spicy tuna, crab and shrimp tempura.  (my three favorites) and on TOP of the delicious burrito I had, when I got into the restaurant the line was ridiculously long however the service was fast and all the employees had smiles on their faces. Whoever invented this concept is a food God! The only thing I do have to say is that the burrito was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it so it made for a messy lunch but that in no way brings down these 5 stars. I wish I could give it more stars because this place deserves it! Just waiting for a location in Summerlin!!!",

Only problem is the parking and getting her it sucks.  been to several others and even the one on Jones is great but like this place--parking sucks at lunch or dinner time.  Being Hawaiian grown anything different like this is great especially because I'm hambun Japanese.",

All the sushi burritos that I've gotten so far were okay. Theyre not the best but theyre not the worst either. And sometimes my burritos taste different every single time i go even though I always get the same one. Maybe it's the sauce. I am not a picky eater so it's okay. I recommend this place :)",

I had tried Jaburritos at the Linq promenade and thought that was really good and didn't believe my cousin when he said that place was crap in comparison. I had the 3 Amigos which had tuna, salmon and hamachi which of course are my favorites. There's so many toppings that you can play around with too. I asked for no red onions but to add the spicy Chipotle mayo sauce, mmmmmm so good! I wouldn't say it's spicy but added a slight zing! My friend got a poke bowl with spicy tuna but let me mention that their spicy tuna was definitely spicy, so just a warning. She said it's good mixed with the eel sauce to add sweetness so just a suggestion. But yea, when it comes to sushi burritos, this place is bomb! My cousin goes every time he visit Vegas and I'll have to do it the same! I don't get the luxury of sushirittos at my home town and test I get that it's essentially an uncut sushi roll, but it's good! Try it! Lol FYI it can be a bit messy, but what burrito isn't?",

The layout of the store is kind of like Chipotle - you stand in a line and order down the row. I can't ever see myself getting a bowl as complicated as some patrons order (how do you even eat that tower of food?); I'd probably do a very minimalist bowl.",

I found out about soho from a Facebook post a friend had posted raving about it. I liked the concept, so the kids and I drove to try it out. The kids burrito is like a California roll, which my youngest one loved. The older kid liked the double dragon and I got the three amigos. Everything was fresh and delicious! Their combinations have the best mixture of sweet, spicy, and crunchy texture, it's like eating a really big sushi roll. I have been back at least a dozen times since and have tried the bowls, and other burritos. My fave is still the three amigos. The employees here are soooo nice and polite, even with difficult customers. I once witnessed a cop in front of me, asking the burrito makers to all change out their gloves because she's allergic to peppers, and jalapenos might have come in contact with them. They quickly grabbed a fresh box of gloves and changed them right there. There was a full line of people waiting behind us, but they never showed the least bit of annoyance. If you love sushi...and want a less expensive option, seriously try a sushi burrito!",

You can order one of their pre-designed combinations or create your own. The rolls are stuffed and are very filling and reasonably priced between $5 and $13.00.

The fish and the quality of the ingredients seemed really high and fresh. No fishy smell at all My friend and I ordered the  1) Double dragon 2) 3 Amigos We took the recommendation and didn't customize.  Also the taro chips- I know they were recommended but all they really are taro chips with furikake (Japenese topping for rice- nori,salt, sugar, sesame seeds).   The only thing that makes this place even closely Spanish/Mexican is the fact that they make their rolls looks like burritos (soy vs nori) and they serve nacho cheese with the taro chips (totally unnecessary)   One of the best parts is the unlimited side bar filled with soy sauce, pickled ginger, jalapenos, wasabi.   The \"burritos\" are quite large but mostly rice. Wasn't too impressed.   But but but they have everyday 4$ Sapporo, all day everyday!",

I didn't visit this location while it was still Jaburritos, but I'm sure it was really similar to how it is now.   Outside, they are doing construction in the area still, and hopefully will be done in the next upcoming months. The inside is small, clean, and simple. The menu is also really simple. You can order one of the specials on the menu, or you can go ahead and customize your burrito, bowl, or whatever else you decide to have that day. I have tried the twin dragon, triple \"s\", and the lion king, with the twin dragon being my favorite, and probably the most popular one on the menu. I don't think you can go wrong with how great sushi burritos taste and I don't see this slowing down. The only downside I would say is that it is just a little pricy for the amount of food you get, but this is a treat that can be enjoyed at any time.",

I like seeing the familiar faces as some of the workers are here during the day and at Soho at night. Along with changing the name, the decor matches the original restaurant and the prices of the burritos are a little cheaper as well.   What's been blowing my mind is getting a double decker version of any burrito. Basically you're getting it wrapped in a tortilla, but lining it with melted cheese and tempura flakes to add a nice crunchy texture to every bite. It seems weird, but trust me, you will not regret it.",

I used to be not vegan and absolutely loved their Three Amigos, and once I went vegan, this became my ONLY sushi burrito option as they offer a DELICIOUS \"Vegan Lover\" burrito. While other similar establishments have vegan options, unlike Soho, they do not offer it as a dedicated menu item, you have to build one yourself, and I am not a fan of that, I do not want to re-create the wheel - if I wanted to build it myself, I'd have done it at home.

I tried to call in an order for pick up but they wouldn't take pick up orders.  That was a negative for me but they told me that they can get me out of there in a timely manner.   Upon arriving there was a line.  I want to say I had about ten people in front of me.  They were moving customers in an adequate amount of time.    I ended up ordering the 3 amigos on soy paper with cream cheese.  This usually comes with a wasabi aioli sauce which isn't a bad mix to this burrito.  I think that it would work well with its spicy mayo as well.  That will be for next time.  I also ordered their taro chips.  If you don't get anything, at least try the taro chips.  They are awesome.  It's sprinkled with a Furikake Seasoning.    My burrito was pretty good.  The blend of the different ingredient was like having a party in my mouth.  Just a whole lot of flavor and texture happening.  Will I come back again?  Of course!  With that being said, Happy Eatings!",

    "text": "2 words: I'm addicted.  Soho Sushi Burrito has become one of my new favorite restaurants.  I love the set-up.  If you haven't been there before, it's like Chipotle for sushi burritos.  You can make your own, where they have an extensive menu where you can have \"whatever you liiiike\" (in the voice of T.I.).  They offer brown rice!  They offer various protein options for the non-raw sushi eaters!  And you can't go wrong with picking any of their specially made sauces like wasabi aioli and chipotle mayo?!  With the ENDLESS possibilities, I was hooked.   Although I like the idea of creating the most amazing sushi burrito, I find myself ordering off their tried and True masterpieces.  If you ate there before the name change, you might notice the menu is different.  Don't be alarmed, the sushi burritos got a bit of a name change too.  The staff informed me that the Redondo is now the 3 Amigos and the Rockport is now Triple S.  So if you're looking for any of the old stuff, they can still make it for you!  One of the staff, Princess, recommended the Lion King, which was also very good, and comes with grilled salmon for those who don't like sushi.    They also offer free condiments near the register.  Their house made soy sauce is thicker than normal, but it definitely helped kick the food up a notch.  They also offer salsa and wasabi.  Wait time isn't too bad, despite the long lines.  I think the max I had to wait was 15 minutes, but it goes by quick.  I also like how they have a machine that evenly distributes the rice onto the seaweed/soy paper.  I also came in to order 5 sushi burritos, and the staff was fast, friendly, and efficient.  The average sushi burrito is about $10, which I think is justifiable.  It's big enough to be considered a meal and offers quality that you can taste.   My only gripe is that there isn't enough seating since it's always packed!  I've taken it to-go every time that I've gone.  But other than that, Soho Sushi Burritos is great!",

I know, it sounds odd. The SH for Soho looks very similar to SC for Sportscenter. Now that I got that off my chest, let's discuss what Soho SushiBurrito is known for and that's, you guessed it, a sushi burrito. I've been here a couple of times and recently brought some friends here. They totally loved Soho. They loved the assembly line ordering process, the different sushi burrito options, the price, and of course, the taste of their meals. It was my friend's recommendation to come here.  And prior to ordering, they wanted to know exactly what a sushi burrito is.  My response...just a bigger sushi hand roll. That's really all a sushi burrito is, right? The difference is that you get a lot more in sushi burrito than you do a sushi hand roll.  I really can't hate on this place or any of the other sushi burrito spots in town because people love this stuff.  We sure have a lot of them coming up and they all tend to taste the same to me. Just don't come here expecting super high quality poke or sushi.  The quality comes with the price and in my opinion, the price is pretty good.  The other good news is that the sushi is fresh and the toppings are almost endless. I will get mine with just salmon or spicy tuna with imitation crab meat and chipotle mayo.  I'll eliminate the rice and go straight seaweed when I want to keep my starches down.  My sushi burrito is pretty good and cost about $10. My only issue is that the food here is not filling.  Take my advice and don't come here hungry.    The service is great.  Soho is very popular and there's almost always a line.  The employees are always efficient and extremely patient with peeps that get to the line undecided. Be on the lookout for a table because they fill up quick.    NOVICE TIP:  If you're not into fish or sushi, then check out their taro nachos, chicken burritos, and steak burritos  2017 Yelp Review #89",

The like was out the door but we decided to stay either way. Overall the line took about 25-30 mins but the food was so good that I didn't mind.  I had the twin dragons on seaweed paper, so good! The mixes of the sauces with the spicy tuna and crispy wontons was on point. I can't wait to get back here and try something else!",

    "text": "I'm not a sushi snob, so this place is perfect to satisfy my occasional cravings. AYCE menus don't interest me and Soho's casual concept allows me to be a picky sushi eater without aggravating a professional sushi chef.  I love how vegan-friendly the menu is here. On my first visit, I selected the Gardein asada as my protein. It was good, but the texture is chewy like meat and I'm not into that. I was very happy to find tofu available on my next trip. I don't like seaweed, so the soy paper wrapper is perfect in place of nori. I also request brown rice and there's no extra charge. See why I'm not welcome at generic sushi bars? They have many sauces available to flavor to your sushi burrito. So far, my favorites are unagi to add sweetness and chipotle mayo, just like I saw at street-side sushi stands in Mexico.  The only thing I miss is my favorite vegetable tempura roll. I would love to see that offered as a special one day. I will mention that my combination of soy paper, brown rice, lots of veggies, and sauces does not create a sturdy burrito. It's very messy with all the ingredients escaping with eat bite. A side of chips comes in handy to scoop up the fallen filler. I tried the taro chips at the recommendation of all social media ever and it worked out well. I'm not a furikake fan, but the sweetness wasn't bad.   Having cheese sauce available is a nice touch because True Mexican sushi rolls are heavy on the cheese: tres quesos o mas. Also, the prices are very fair, making a Soho SushiBurrito a cheap and fast meal. Sure, you will pay more for seafood, but I appreciate that I'm charged accordingly.",

    "text": "I went to a similar sushi burrito restaurant (Jaburritos) during my residency interview in Las Vegas with a friend; not sure if it was this location before the name change or a different location. Nonetheless, it was not my first time having a sushi burrito.  Though there is a lot of construction going on in this plaza at the moment, Soho SushiBurrito IS open! The line moves quickly and it's basically like Chipotle only with sushi. I found the sushi rice machine fascinating; it stamps out a perfect square layer of rice. There are several sushi burritos to choose from, or you can custom create your own. There are also some fun sides (e.g. taro chips) and Asian + non-Asian drinks to choose from. They even have mochi ice cream!  Portion is okay. Perhaps it's a little pricey for what you get, though the quality is good and food is tasty.",

You put an order in and show up 20 to 30 minutes later they haven't even looked at it. when I asked what happened as they were all standing in the back gossiping the girl just shrugged and rolled her eyes at me. They weren't helping anybody. The one guy said we were busy. Well you're not anymore? it's been terrible in the past when we've ordered from the mobile app. It seems they ignore it until you show up. Also they make the burritos really loose and they all fall apart. Best to go in and stand there watching them otherwise your burrito is worthless.",

You get a monster sushi burrito that's cheaper than most rolls at a sushi restaurant that are tiny compared to this sucker. Crazy!  These burritos are HUGE! I can never finish one!   You can order one of their awesome creations and my favorite happens to be the twin dragon (minus the lettuce and I substitute the guacamole for slivers of avocado and sometimes I add seaweed salad). The ingredients are always fresh and they give you lots of fish! The rice ratio is nothing compared to the goodies! Check out my pics...  You can also build your own and pick whatever your heart desires and they also offer bowls and cooked ingredients like chicken & steak with nacho cheese sauce! :)   This place is always busy as they should be. Order ahead if you're rushing...",

We walked up to counter and chose our rolls. I opted for th vegan burrito... No vegan \"meat\" just extra veggies. The also have the \"veggie\" option. I love this place for even catering to the vegan weirdos, like me, of the world. They were out of the vegan chipotle sauce... I just had them add an eclectic mix of three other really great vegan sauces... Two were fairly sweet... And with the added Jalepenos to my burrito... It was quite the combo. The concept it pretty amazing.... I would Come back and grab it again; I would just need to be in the mood for it.   The other burrito we ordered, but I couldn't eat... Was the angry tuna. It's not vegan... And from what I was told... Rather underwhelming. My friend definitely preferred my vegan burrito.   Both of us really like some crunch... And the taro chips are pretty freaking good. They are made in house... And I would totally consider having some of them crumbled into my next burrito. We also had a little side edamame, fair sized portion for the price! Our total bill came out to just over 20 dollars... Two burritos... Chips... Edamame... And a fountain ice tea. Definitely a good deal... And definitely a spot worth checking out:)",

I've been here quite a few times. I always get a customized sushi burrito with soy paper. They have a lot of selections to add in. From hot food to cuts of fresh fish. Think of this place like Chipotle. Basically you go down the line selecting what you want I your burrito or bowl. You can add as much as you want. There are some items that have an up charge.  If you get a burrito with soy or seaweed make sure you eat it soon. It can get soggy after a while. Though I never had a problem with the wrapper ripping. Everything seems to stay together.",

But wow, it was oh so SOHO good!  Being my first time ordering I stayed on the cheaper side:  Fire Cracker ($5.25) - spicy tuna with cucumber, cabbage, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo & honey habanero sauce.  Also added surimi crab for only an extra $1.50!  Not a bad deal for under $7!  Added a side of shiso tomatillo sauce for FREE!  Really though if you ask, they will let you have a side of just about any of their sauces, gratis.  Tasty!  Even after the travel it had to take from the restaurant back to my work office!  So surprising, sushi...in a burrito!  I thought it would have been too big to enjoy like regular sushi, but you can bite into this bugger easily like it's a huge hand roll!  Ingredients were fresh too.  The nori wrapper wasn't soggy, rice was cooked well, and the spicy tuna and surimi crab were well seasoned.  The fresh cucumber, cabbage, and crispy wonton strips added much needed texture.  The sweet but tangy honey habanero sauce added some nice kick!  Their shiso tomatillo sauce was an easy add too, I recommend it.  Like a tomatillo salsa with an added umami element.  The burrito was big enough I only managed to eat half.  Took the other half for the wifey to try!  She thought the concept was strange at first too, but after her first bite of leftovers she was sold.  She liked it very much!  I think a visit is in order to Soho SushiBurrito again in the near future for some Asian inspired eats!  BANZAI!!",

    "text": "Visited at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  Lunch crowd was in full effect, but the wait time was minimal. Under 10 minutes from the line, order, and paying out. Service: 5/5 I was thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the assembly line crew that put together my sunny salmon sushi burrito.  They were friendly even though they were extremely busy. Food: 4/5 The Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito was tasty and not messy to eat for a sushi burrito.  The burrito was packed tight to keep the eating easy.  Ingredients were fresh. The seaweed salad I had with my combo could have been fresher, but definitely not an issue. Value: 5/5 The combo of my Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito, seaweed salad, and UCC grean tea drink was $11.94 before tax and tip for a savings .50 vs a la carte. Summary:  Service and food has been consistently good from my previous visits.  The seating is limited so I usually take my food to go versus sitting down.  I noticed on this visit that Uber eats delivers for them and it might be something I'll consider when the schedule is tight.  A great place for SushiBurritos to go",

    "text": "Now I know what all the hype is about.  Clearly a sushi burrito grabbed my attention. Why wouldn't it?!!??   First off I was confused by the name some since on yelp and other patrons told me it was called something else, but after I cleared up the confusion I finally found it. The place was a little hard to find because of all the construction, but I'm sure it's only temporary.   The place is like chipotle. You pick burrito, bowl, nachos, etc....then on top you're choice of protein. New thing for me was a vurrito wrapped in seaweed. They do have a wide selection of sushi and sauces that was fun. You get to add your choice of sauce, vegetables and salsas at the end. Interesting to say the least.   I tried the yellowtail and spicy tuna with the ponzu sauce. The burrito is a tad on the slim side but overall not bad. I am a bit interested in the other sushis they have, so I'll be back.   Service was par, we did arrive at a busy time so maybe that was a played a factor in it. Nonetheless, really cool concept! Check it out",

    "text": "With just a few more hours in Vegas, my husband and I realized we hadn't had any seafood yet on our trip. How tragic! As we scanned Yelp for nearby ideas, Soho came up as a suggestion and would fulfill our desire for fresh sushi and another fab food craze item, a sushiritto!  It was fun to watch the sushirittos be made. There's a full-on machine that presses the sushi race into a square seaweed wrapper! At the end, there's another machine that tightly wraps the sushiritto, which is a good thing since the people putting together our sushirittos were generous with the toppings. I wasn't sure how it was all going to fit!  I opted for the High Maintenance, and it was awesome. Mmm, I can still taste the fresh yellowtail, spicy tuna, and guacamole. What a brilliant combination! The cabbage and wonton crackers added a great crunch, as well. I really couldn't have picked a better option. (Tim M. got the Twin Dragon, which he swears was better, but we'll have to agree to disagree.)  SSB was one of the best culinary decisions of our whole trip. You should definitely go for it.",

It was very similar to Chipotle but it also has prebuilt bowls you can choose from as well. We end up getting the high maintenance bowl and the fire cracker burrito. The burrito was amazing and the combo was delicious. The spicy tuna was on the salty side but it was compensated by the ginger that I added on. There's also a small side bar where you can get some ginger, wasabi, mild sauce, soy sauce, siracha and some jalapeno. The fish was not super fresh but still very good. Overall, I would definitely come back or wish there would be one that open in Seattle. Would definitely come back",

The entire front side of the strip mall is under construction and it was not easy finding a parking spot at lunch time. There was about a 15 minute wait in line. The dining area is small, so you may be taking your order to-go if it is busy.  We ordered the Angry Tuna, Twin Dragon, and the 3 Amigos. We all chose the seaweed wrapper. Everything was excellent. They were all basically giant hand rolls filled with different items. Most of the rolls are around $8 to $10 dollars. Definitely worth it.  I will be returning to try more menu items. I recommend that you give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.",

The meals are around $10+ and the quality of the fish is actually quite good for a \"fast casual\" type of place.    I ordered the Twin Dragon, their most popular sushi burrito, per the chef.  Spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and I added on some fish eggs.  Then couple that with some veggies, corn, unagi sauce, seaweed salad, and wasabi and you got yourself a great meal.    It filled me up, it was fresh, and it was unique.  The only downfall was that the lines were huge during lunch and the burrito fell apart on me.  Otherwise, great job Soho SushiBurrito,  I will be back very soon.",

And yes...I know there's other places similar to this, but a) they aren't near my house, and b) I've never been...so this review is strictly based on Sohos.   But I digress. If you've read other reviewers this place serves sushi burritos-and they are tasty! Think sushi meets burritos meets chipotle. You can create your own burrito or bowl or salad with ingredients such as spicy tuna, yellowtail, steak, chicken, shrimp tempura, guacamole, lettuce, cucumbers, jalapenos, tempura crunch, wonton crisps, and more. If you aren't feeling creative, you can select a burrito from one of their options. Again, it is chipotle style, so you have compete control over what does/does not go into your meal.   We ordered the twin dragon and the three S's burritos. The three S's had a bit too much sauce, but it was tasty. If ordered again, I would tell them to easy on the sauce. I preferred the twin dragon, which was a little lighter on the sauce and delicious.   We were there on a Saturday night around 6pm and there was a steady stream of patrons. There's not a lot of seating area in the restaurant, but that didn't seem to be an issue. Many people were taking their order to go. Service was quick and efficient considering the number of people.   Overall, if you like sushi this place is definitely worth the trip. If there's people in line, don't let that discourage you, it shouldn't take too long. :-)",

The burritos are like over stuffed sushi rolls.  The burritos have only a thin layer of rice and generous servings of fish in the middle.  You can also choose what type of vegetables and sauces go in your sushi burrito.  I had the angry tuna.  It was tasty.  Also tried the taro chips.  They were tasty.  Fast service and the prices were fair.  It is a small place and it was very crowded.   I can not think of any reason why not to love this place.",

Unfortunately, the quality has been going way downhill. This is a really bad time for them to start slacking, considering all the competing sushi burrito places that have opened or are opening recently.   Today it got the worst it's been--my Triple S burrito was so poorly assembled and so drenched in sauce it was slimy and gross to hold and the soy paper immediately started disintegrating. My boyfriend's Angry Tuna was similarly poorly done, although his didn't fall apart while he was eating it.   I want to be loyal to this place but when the burritos cost $10.50 each, I don't have to. I've tried a couple of the other new places in town and they're good enough or better to replace it for me. I'll probably come back and if this keeps up I'm done for good.",

I understand the name was changed to keep things uniform with the sushi place on the other end of town. The names of the rolls changed but the ingredients were the same. When they were Jaburritos, I had the Redondo which is now called The Three Amigos. When I went after they changed names to Soho Sushi Burrito, I got the Twin Dragon and added on the taro chips and cheese dip (served in a brown paper bag). Nice portions and pretty filling. You can substitute the nori wrap for soy wrap, if you desire. You can also create your own sushi burrito with lots of different options to choose from. The price leans more towards the pricier side but I'm fine with that. I love this latest trend of fusing Japanese and Mexican together creating these sushi burritos. As of the time of this review, the strip mall area they are located in is undergoing some storefront remodeling. Just look for the sign on the scaffolding. They do tend to get pretty busy during the peak lunch and dinner hours. If you can hit the place up earlier or later, you won't have to wait as long.",

But I give Soho props for really making it unique and fusing both types of food in a way you can satisfy your sushi and burrito cravings at the same time.

If you aren't feeling creative, you could also choose a burrito from one of their signature sushi burritos. They are also providing vegan beef and vegan chicken options for vegetarians. You can completely control over what does go into your burrito. I love it !",

Long line, high price, and hardly a burrito (it was so terribly small).  My experience with Soho was the complete opposite! I had a simple build-your-own style sushirito. Each component was extremely fresh and I was perfectly full after my last bite. I personally don't have a huge appetite so unless you really stuff your burrito, I can see how it might feel small to others.  To have paid about $10-12 per roll isn't too bad considering what sushi costs on its own. I did hold back a bit with my add-ons so it may not be the best price ever, but definitely not a deal breaker. I love Soho's sister restaurant as well so it was great to learn that this place is equally awesome.",

    "text": "Fusing the ingredients of Sushi in a burrito is as ingenious as it gets. There is no doubt that people have admired this novel concept... look at their ratings and if still in doubt, show up at 11AM - when the store opens - to see how quickly it gets crowded. Can't wait for this business to hand out franchises so that other cities can enjoy the fantastic fusion food as well. And when that happens, places like Subway will have a real run for their money.   One friendly piece of advice to the management: have a staff advisor available for consultation before the ordering station to help with figuring out suitable options (there are so many!). Information on the board is helpful, but the board does not answer questions. And by the time a server behind the stall attempts to answer any question (and trust me, you will have quite a few), there is already a huge pressure to choose something quickly because the line of hungry folks behind is too long. So, some advise and answered questions well in advance of ordering will be helpful.",

I got a seaweed paper burrito with soft shell crab, spicy tuna, green onion, cucumbers, seaweed salad, fresh jalapenos, crispy wonton pieces and screaming O sauce. Everything tasted fresh and I loved the combination of textures in the burrito. The employees were friendly and smiling. And there wasn't a super long line when we dined in on a Friday night. My gripe is, if I'm going to drop $15 on a meal just for MYSELF, I better be full afterwards. I could have easily eaten another burrito, but I wasn't going to spend another $10 for another one. I went home just to eat again. And the taro chips that everyone is raving about? Yeah, not fond of those or the furikake seasoning that was on them. Glad to say I tried it, but I'll just go to AYCE sushi and be satisfied.",

I opted for soy paper instead of seaweed paper and was a great choice. So was my brown rice (and they don't charge extra for brown rice---yay for that!!!!) my only recommendation is to ask them to roll it really well/tight. My burrito fell apart in less than 3 bites!!!

The only big complaint I have is that this place is too small, always having to rush to get a table and rushing to eat so others can. Plus, people lining up around you while you eat is horrible and not sanitary (woman sneezed next to me without covering herself and I wanted to punch her). It just ruins the moment of enjoying good food. A tip to the restaurant, get a bigger place, arrange your lining area and dont raise prices... You will stay successful if you do this. Trust me. Lol",

Taro chips and cheese were surprisingly delicious as well!! Aloe vera drinks ++++ lots of good sauces and lime for free~",

The sushi as well as the ingredients were all fresh and delicious. The taro chips with cheese sauce is really good - I would recommend it. My coworkers and I got there a little earlier than noon and the service was quick. Heads up -  It gets really busy at lunch though.",
