My adult son and I decided to try this place last evening as we live in the neighborhood and are always looking for a new place to have a bite to eat and a drink. As they say, \"You never have a second chance to make a first impression!\" From the moment we met our waitress, she had the personality of a door knob and completely ruined our mood as we were just looking to have a pleasant time and enjoy ourselves. We don't expect her to flirt with us but at least try to interact with your customers and make them feel welcome. We like to feel good about spending our money and having a nice time. Aside from from that, the food was average at best and the drinks are as weak as circus kool-aid. Luckily there are many other possibilities in a town like Las Vegas. They had their chance and they blew it.",

The menu and food is good enough to stand on its own. My favorite is the chicken fingers. They have an insane number of beers on tap. They have a great selection of food and drink specials. They have tv's everywhere including the patio. The patio is a good size for the venue and the misters keep you cool in the desert heat. This is the see and be seen place to enjoy a game.",

We've had nothing but good things to say about the food and the environment, but other than that, I have never experienced such bad service in my life. The waitresses don't bring out drinks like EVER, and they just aren't attentive to the tables. My friends have experienced the same thing on separate occasions. There is one AMAZING waitress though who we keep coming back for in hopes that she's working. She's the one from Cleveland who works nights. She's fantastic. Always prompt, nice, and makes us feel welcome. She's actually sat with us on multiple occasions and got to know us. She's so friendly and attentive. Thank you to her for keeping us coming back. Actually, I don't think I've ever had such a good waitress. Thanks Cleveland girl!!!",

It was a very good serving size enough to share with friends! The beer listings is what really caught my eye! Although I don't drink beer all of my friends do and they love that there are so many beers to pick from and they are all very reasonably priced ! They have a really cool system where you can put your name in and it will keep track of the beers you've had and displays it for everyone to see! This is the new hangout spot for all of my friends.

    "text": "I've been stopping for breakfast during my Sunday morning bike rides and I decided to give PKWY Tavern a try.  I had been here several times when it was the Roadrunner Saloon and this was on my planned route.  I walked in and stopped at the podium but there was no one in sight.  I walked down the ramp into the bar area and again not a soul in sight.  After a short wait, a woman came to the bar area and I asked about breakfast.  They do have breakfast and I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I was the only customer at about 8:30 AM.  The server brought me a menu and then brought a hot cup of coffee.  The menu is sparse for breakfast--there are only 7 items.  This is a young person's beer drinking, pong playing kind of place and breakfast would not be a big draw.  Regardless, I chose the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich the menu describes as \"griddled Texas toast with American cheese, bacon, tomato and fried eggs served with tater tots.\"  Within a short time, my plate was brought.  The tater tots were standard ones that had not been deep fried again but were most likely heated in a microwave.  The sandwich was good with crispy bacon.  The interplay of tomato, cheese, and egg was good.  The server came back and refilled my coffee.  She was a very pleasant woman and her service was excellent.  After paying, I took the opportunity to check out the changes since I had been there before.  The cowboy/Western theme is pretty much gone.  Where there had been booths on the south side secondary eating area, there are now large window doors to open the place up to the patio that's enclosed with a fence.  It also has artificial grass which is a plus for our water use.  I'm sure this is a great place to enjoy some of their large selection of beers and socialize.   It was also in this area where I locked my bike.  It was inside the main door but before the second set of doors into the restaurant.  That gave some security by not having the bike outside facing Flamingo Road.  I'd come back again.  For Sunday breakfast while others are sleeping in or sleeping it off, it was a quiet place.",

We asked what was wrong with it & he said nothing. He had someone else take my friends ID in the back and look at it and came out and asked to talk to him. So we followed , and then they told him \" we can't take it here.\" They didn't give reasoning, so we left. They stood outside as we left which was very annoying.

I hate when I sit down and the booth is dirty and table sticky. Why?? The place was not busy.   We ordered 2 beers. I asked the girl if they had Peroni (they have about 500 beers) she told me no. I asked her to check and she seemed to get mad. Of course when she came back they had my beer. No need to get mad when you work in a bar that is focused mainly on it's beer selection.  Ordered the steak nachos for an app. and that was not a good choice. Usually nachos have cheese on them. Hmm-- maybe they were mad about me asking about the beer so they decided to skip the cheese on my nachos. =) Oh well.  We ordered 2 of the regular burgers. Nothing special. One med and one well done. Of course when they brought those out they were both pink inside. Are you kidding me? How hard is it to cook a well done burger? I had to send it back and of course the girl was getting angrier. They came out to inform me it would be an additional 20 minutes for my burger. I did not have time for these games. So I told them to just take the old patty and put it back on the grill. They did and brought it out. Half of it was still pink. I let the angry girl take it away. She did not apologize or offer to take it off my bill. Shame on her.  I could understand these things happening if this place was slammed, but there were only like 5 other customers in the whole place and maybe 2 of us were eating. Seems like there might be some problems in this place. What a waste of a meal and money. I will not be back until they change management.",

We asked for water and she went to go get it while we looked at the beer list. So many choices but I decided on a strawberry beer as I like the fruity ales and hubby got a blonde of some sort. She brought the water and took our order. Beers came and they were nice and cold and food followed shortly after. Nice area with pool tables, big bar area and a little two lane bowling alley, also had a nice outdoor area with lots of tvs. Booths also had tvs as well. We can't wait to come in and catch a game during football season with the family. As we were checking out the different areas the Manager came and talked to us and we chatted for a while. Nice guy, might turn into a regular hang out spot for us.",

The last time I was here, I told the bartender I normally drink Saizons and he introduced me to the Sierra Nevada Raspberry Sundae Ale. Only thing I drank all night.  For food, I recommend their giant pretzels, either with beer cheese or in their Barcuterie Plate. They are HUGE, soft and mealy inside, and clearly fresh from the oven. Easily the best pretzel I've ever had.  I also love the spinach dip, which comes with these incredible handmade pita chips. Out of this world.  The venue is pretty big with bowling, darts, and arcade games indoors, and a huge outdoor area with giant versions of Jenga, Cornhole, etc.  Fantastic spot for a chill night with a group of friends, or to make some new ones. 100% would come again!",

However, the service that was received by staff at this location was so disappointing that management and ownership of this location should be aware. The hostess was friendly and accommodating with seating for my kids on this visit. Our meals were appetizing, including the fried chicken for 2 and fish and chips. Our server took our order and when it arrived another guy brought our meals out. When we said politely please put our dishes down out of our kids' reach because they were hot he said, \"Obviously.\" Our orders did not come with sauce such as ketchup for fries or tartar sauce for fish and chips. Also, my husband's grandma was given someone else's meal and my little one's grilled cheese did not arrive with the order. Our server came by and said that she put the order in and something was wrong with their system very rudely. When the order was ready thirty minutes later, she threw it on the table with a sarcastic remark. No apologies given, carelessness, and overall very regrettable experience. If you are contemplating on dining here with family or friends and would like awful service, this is the place for you. One star for nice hostess and another for appetizing fish and chips.",

I've meant so many wonderful people and made friends. It's a great place to watch Sports, good gambling, meeting people. But not my thing after 10:30pm but a great time for the younger crowd. Some of the workers ( bartenders) moved on, but we follow.  Now only thing is the restroom, weekend great you have the wonderful lady helping and has thing you need. But week days , just somebody has to keep up with it. That's my one problem!!  Thanks to Niell and Nick , and the beautiful Karla  Happy new year!",

My brother and I stopped in for a drink during an uncharacteristically slower time one night during the week and from the moment we sat down it was less than a pleasant experience. There was no greeting. Despite a server being present, she was unable to let us know that we would only receive service if we went to the bar. Nor did any of the bartenders. We waited for approximately 20 mins to see if anyone was going to talk to us. No one ever did. When we did walk up to the bar we were finally greeted.   If the venue had been wall-to-wall people the way I've seen it in the past, I would understand the unresponsive staff, but this was by no means a busy night for them.   Disappointing. I live in the neighborhood. Pass by it daily. It would have been nice to have a new spot to frequent. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "There are definitely pros and cons about PKWY. The two top pros is as said by Mr.David V. One of the pros about PKWY is the large draft beer list. And the number of games you can play here just like bowling, corn hole, beer pong, jenga, and so on.   My boyfriend and I live only a street down on Fort Apache and so this is one of our go-to places when we want to hang out with friends. It is definitely a fun place to hang out. There is always lots of people here, especially on the weekends.   The drinks are sadly overpriced! And every bar I gamble in comps your drinks but do not expect that from this place at all! Bartenders never pay attention to you, so service is not the best here. You always have to hail someone to ask for a menu, to order food, and to even get a refill on your drinks. Like I said, if you sit there and gamble for 2 hours and have two beers, they sometimes won't even comp you one drink. You would be lucky to get one of them comped. So if you want to gamble, do not go here!  Food is aight. I've had both good and bad experiences with it. It's regular bar food.   Surprisingly, the security here is a lot more friendlier than the bartenders. They remember you if you're a regular.   Three stars for beer list, games, and cool security staff.",

    "text": "Worst bartender service EVER! The bartenders are extremely rude, and look like they hate their job. The waitresses aren't bad, I've have a good experience with them. They've been polite, and professional. It's just the bartenders, man. They're terrible.   I went to Parkway on Flamingo & 215 last night, and I've been to the establishment a couple other times. The few times I've been I usually try to get a different bartender to provide service to see if they're all crappy, and most are, except Nial (I think that's his name, he's at the inside bar.) I hate going to the inside bar because it's usually extremely packed. Therefore, I resort to the outside bar. Which I hate resorting to because there is one particular bartender that takes the cake on worst customer service. He's a tall, older looking, thin guy that has \"I hate my job\" written across his face. The last two visits I've had to go to him and it's been terrible! He makes no conversation, you can't ask a question because it's like you're asking for a million dollars, and everything just seems to be a bother to him. So avoid the outside bar unless his partner which is a shorter thin guy with tattoos helps you, he's a lot nicer.   Besides the crappy bartenders the food is not so bad, and the music is hit and miss. All depends on the night you go, and which DJ is spinning.",

I ordered a Margarita and my husband got a beer and some mozzarella sticks . The beer was good but the margarita tasted just like the ones in the can (super sweet and nasty) and The mozzarella sticks must've been frozen because it was super greasy and wet inside, every time you took a bite you got something dripped on you and the sauce tasted like it came from a pizza lunch-able. When we got our bill I found out that my \"canned\" margarita cost $12!!!! For 3 things we paid $29 never again will I come here. I don't expect much from bar food but really guys! Smh",

Be warned if you're 28 and older, you are too old to be there. I mean it's fun, it reminds me of a smaller version of Gold Spike- games, board games, ping pong, bowling, darts, shuffle board, pool tables, slot machines - shit- everything you need to entertain yourself or friends. It's essentially suburbia's  neighborhood party on the weekends.   The vibe? 20-year old Hipster/horny muscle packed, crop-top, too much make up wearing, pretty boy/girl individuals. It's annoying. Most people are there to get laid and show off. But if you're like me, you just enjoy the drunk people watching and entertainment.   The bartenders are alright, kinda slow, and they talk too much when it's busy. I've never had the food. Beer is in abundance and pricey except for their happy hour which is recommended. Sometimes they show big UFC fights too.",

    "text": "A friend of mine had told me about this place and said it was worth a check out because of the cool bartenders and fabulous beer selection, so my wife and I went to check it out last night.    Pros:  Friendly staff (hostess, busboy), large beer selection (on paper at least), nice outdoor patio area  Cons:  SLOW Service, Food 1 1/2  start at best, beer list not quite accurate  We met the hostess on our way in, and told her we were interested in sitting in the bar area, which is open seating.  After we picked out a table she brought us our menus and told us our server would be right with us.  At the time there were about 10 people at the bar and only a table of 3 guys in the whole bar area.  We sat our table for approximately 10 minutes before our server (who looked at us at least 5 times, but was too busy flirting with the table of 3 guys) made it to our table. Upon taking our drink order, it took her another 5 minutes to get back with our drinks - a martini and and ice tea.    A few more minutes passed and she came back to get our food order, at which time I placed my first attempt at a bottled beer listed on the beer menu.  After looking at me with confusion and verifying that I was actually reading a beer off the menu, she went back to place our orders.  A few minutes later she returned telling me they were out of the that beer.  I ordered another beer, and after a few minutes received the same response that they were out.  Well at this point I just went for the old standby - Corona.    My wife ordered the Prime Rib Melt.  The sandwich came out with a side of fries.  Upon reviewing the menu again as I write this, it states all sandwiches come with a choice of side, no choice was given.  However, besides being a little greasy, she like the sandwich and commented that the fries were nice and crispy without being overcooked.    I ordered the Blackened Shrimp and Grits.  I really was looking forward to this dish, but when it came out I immediately sensed I would be in for utter disappointment, and I was not wrong.  The grits had  congealed to a point that the whole top layer had made a smooth mold.  In the mold of grits I had 5 shrimp.  I cut into the first shrimp and realized there was no way these were fresh, but definitely frozen, or had been extremely overcooked.  All five shrimp were so tough and rubbery, that I could have used them in a game of racquetball.  Additionally, the flavor was very bland, which in a \"blackened\" dish; you would not expect to be the case.  Also, our server did not offer me a side, so for $15.95, all I received was 5 tasteless rubbery shrimp and a mold of cheese flavored grits.  Very, very disappointing.   While we were eating our server came over over once, about 15 minutes after we received our food (food was brought out by bus boy, who gave us way better service), and pushed the check on us because she was \"getting off shortly and wanted to close out.\"  I used to work in the service industry as both a bartender and bar manager, this is definitely not the training I would have provided my staff, when it come to customer service.    All in all, as much I would really like to enjoy this place, it falls short on so many levels.  Needless to say with all of the other dinning options in Vegas available to locals, we won't be going back.",

I found myself running up a big tab and not satisfied and then you top it off with the bad service. The one positive is the atmosphere but it doesn't make up for all the negatives.",

The bartender seemed burnt out and the few customers that were there were just nasty. Negative energy feeding off of negative energy.  It was sucking the life out of us so we had to leave.",

Came here with a group of 8 friends last night around 8:30 and didn't head out till 12:00. LOUD bar with a lot of young people usually twenty- somethings and bros, which isn't my scene. I'd rather hang out at a dive bar, receive more attentive service and have my drinks served in a more timely manner .  Long story short, you have to be in the mood for this atmosphere, because the crowd can get really annoying and if you don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for drinks; then this is your go-to bar. Maybe I'm getting older and over the Vegas basic bar scene . They have over 200 beers on tap, but not all of them are available at the same time. If you sign up for the PKWY card you receive deals and a shirt .",

Great idea for a bar but the service is bad and the food is just ok. We played somee shuffle board and we were  timed out both times. A flat fee would be better. Corporate nickel dimeing is what most of us don't come to the bar for. Played some darts after and asked for multiple IDs for two sets of darts for the same party. I guess the place gets alot of dart thieves. We would have stayed a bit longer but the ac wasn't working and the misters were down for the night.  Maybe just a lame night but the place is new and shouldn't be going through so many issues.  The five stars goes to our waitress.  She was helpful and attentive.  The rest was bad..",

Every time I come to parkway I always order the same thing the big cheese and tomato soup. I open it up and it's literally 3 pieces of bread with one slice of cheddar cheese. No jalapeno no onion no bacon. And on top of that, the smallest amount of soup, I seriously couldn't believe it. I'm so beyond pissed off right now that I drove all the way down there for this piece of crap I could of made at home. Although I called back they are refunding me my money I just don't understand how you can fuck up one of the most easiest items on the menu. It's a fucking Monday night and it was not busy. Just goes to show me how LAZY people really are. DO YOU'RE FUCKING JOB RIGHT OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL. I definitely will NEVER order food to go here. #annoying  P.S. I just tried to eat this shit and it was so disgusting I just threw it away..... what a waste and a disgrace smfh.",

With more than enough on draft and a huge selection in bottles/cans, you can't go wrong giving this place a try.  I've been here a few times, and I have to say I've only order food once so overall my experiences are strictly with beer and service.  The service tends to be hit or miss (especially if they are super busy, which is pretty often on the weekends). Even if your own server isn't great I've noticed that other servers are typically happy to help you out. This is much appreciated as typically most places it's hard to get other servers' attention. I also highly recommend downloading their app, as it gives you the most up-to-date list of beers they currently have in stock! Super convenient.  The place is very casual, with live music/DJs from time to time and they always have music playing. They also have PLENTY to do while you're there. This is one of the main reasons we love coming here. They have bowling, shuffle board, pool, darts, giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, and of course beer pong. Their out door seating is perfect for many of these things, and there is also a separate bar outside (perfect for ordering another great beer and enjoying the weather when it's nice).   This last time I finally gave their giant pretzel and beer cheese a try. IT. Was. Amazing! The pretezel was as big as a dinner plate, and came out super hot/fresh. Outside of the pretzel crisp while the inside was super soft. To top it off, the beer cheese was a perfect pair.   Above all else, this place is always open is you know you can always grab a great beer and decent food!",

Sharon then preceded to approach every employee working to complain about our table dramatically while bringing unneeded attention to us (so unprofessional).

The outdoor area is cool with all the games and TVs. Inside there's plenty of comfortable seating, TVs everywhere, a 2 lane bowling alley, and pool tables.   If you're looking for deals, their happy hour specials consist of $3 drinks and $5 and $6 appetizers. The beer list is long and the food is surprisingly good for a sports bar/gaming tavern. The chicken and waffle sliders, in particular, are amazing. They come two per order, the waffles held up fairly well, maintaining their crispness and sandwiching lightly breaded chicken. Pour some syrup on it and you'll be in heaven. If you want a burger, go for the Belly burger -- a half pound burger topped with  seared pork belly glazed with BBQ sauce.  Don't forget to check out the restroom. They've got cool urinals made out of kegs.",

Hawaii IDs have a hologram on it, if there's no hologram it's fake! MINE HAD A HOLOGRAM. You can google it too or call the Hawaii DMV and ask about it, they'll tell you the same thing. But bc they \"felt it was fake\" and didn't even scan it they denied entrance. I showed all my debit/credit cards.. even my TAM( ALCOHOL SERVING CARD) card and they still said my ID was fake. I did not come here all the way from downtown to be turned away because of their opinion of me. How RUDE.",

They took a few items off the menu that I solely went there for, so now there's no reason to return which is sad since I live 3 blocks away. The food that we did get was disgusting and it wouldn't surprise me if this establishment has new management. We usually ordered the veggie burger, it was one of the best in town, too bad it's gone. Instead we ordered chicken tacos which were awful, and the \"wtf fries\". The wtf fries were a joke. Again, prior to the menu change this place had great french fries, I think they may have even been home made. These wtf fries were disgusting, soggy cheap fries drenched in even cheaper nacho cheese with fake guacamole.  Besides the food being bad, the service sucked as well. I had to physically track down the waitress a couple times just to get our check and pay. We won't be back again.",

Went here on a Saturday afternoon to get some food and beer in our stomachs after my cousins had gotten off a flight and we were definitely not disappointed!   Although there were happy hour items, we decided to divulge in different beers, appetizers, and food. Let me just say, yes, those chicken fingers really are good (Thanks Rey for making us eat here!) and the beer selection was amazing. However, my mainnnnn goes to the \"PB&J\" sandwich!   BUT WHY?! It's not peanut butter...its PORK BELLY!  with a JALAPENO JELLY SAUCE  I'm just saying, if you're okay with heat/spice and want that savory taste, this is the best! The cites of pork belly are pretty thick, buuuut fairly soft. This dish made it for me, honestly.  So yes, this place is more than just an adult playground/fun spot at night. You CAN get good food, good drinks, and a chill afternoon here. (But if you don't like flies, don't sit near the outter side by the garage doors. You will be annoyed )",

After having dinner at another local restaurant, we thought we'd check out this place since our friend from out of town wanted to hang out. The night started off pretty good. We got there before the crowd really picked up. And that's when it started to go down hill.  By the third round of drinks, my vodka sprite became just a sprite. I'm not sure if the bartender didn't hear us or he forgot but it was disappointing which killed my buzzed. To be fair, he was trying to multi-task and making drinks for these other girls who came after us.   Three hours in, our friends wanted to order some chili cheese fries. After trying to flag a waitress for about 10-15mins, they placed their order and told the waitress to omit the chili because they're vegetarians. About 30mins later the fries show up and it was plain chili cheese fries. My friend had to flag down the waitress again for another 10-15mins to replace the order. The food was mediocre at best. Reminded me of cafeteria food the way it was presented. Another 15-20mins and the fries finally came out.   As they were enjoying their food, my bf and I were in a deep conversation, when he gets hit on his thigh by something. He brushed it off. Then a coaster came flying at our table and falls right into the food. Some drunk idiots were throwing around coasters to other customers around them and hit our table three times as well. Seeing the coaster, in her fries, after about an hr wait didn't sit well with my friend so she throw something back at them. She calls security to let them know, and after going back and forth between the idiots who started it and our table, we were kicked out of the restaurant. There were other customers who had our back and tried to talk to them but at that point they just wanted us gone. When my bf asked at why the other party wasn't being held accountable, all the security guy and the manager said was, \"they've been drinking and are being idiots...\" So that means, it's ok for people to go into your establishment, throw stuff at other customers, but it's ok because they've been drinking and being idiots but it's not ok for us to \"retaliate\" by throwing stuff back at them? We're just suppose to sit here and take it? They had no answer...   If you like shitty customer service, mediocre food, and want to relive your college days at a frat party then come here. Waste of a 25mins drive...",

I really liked this spot but I never expected to be walked by without a simple... I'll be right there form the servers. PKWY TAVERN.... you dropped the ball on this one.

Orders the fries and mini corn dogs, delicious. Interesting sweet/spicy twist on the fries. My rum and coke was super strong so they def don't skimp on the alcohol which probably why drinks are a bit more. The waitress was friendly and attentive, which is impressive since we were outside playing games and kept moving around.  It being half indoor/outdoor makes a nice ambience since you can play games outside without feeling you're shoulder to shoulder with people like most bars. At some point at night they have a curfew where children or the underage can't be permitted which is awesome. I didn't really hear all the details but it's a nice rule they have implemented. It's annoying when my husband go out and its late at night and you have screaming children hanging around. Sorry parents but get a babysitter, seriously.  Overall, the tavern is enjoyable and good place to hang out with people but like i said before, conversation can be difficult due to music. The Tavern is is always busy, I've gone to the gym at 3am (even on weekday nights) and it will still be packed with cars.",

My hubby loves salt and i always give him grief about it... but in this instance even he thought the food was waaay too salty. My dish was almost inedible due to the garlic salt and salt on it. They even salted the salad! The waitress did offer to send it back but im always afraid of what they will do to my food so i declined. We wont be back.",

I'm pretty sure this place wouldn't be so popular if it weren't for the food, beer club, and HUGE beer selection.  My personal favorite is the Pineapple Cider!  The staff is friendly, too, but soooooooooooooo slow.    They have a great happy hour selection- appetizers are half off, $3 cocktails, and beer specials.  For the most part, I've never met a PKWY app that I haven't liked!  There are also a lot of games, but I've never played because they've been busy every time I've visited.  One other thing- if you are sensitive to heat, you should know that they frequently open the bar up (they have glass garage doors) to the gaming area outside... It's an indoor-outdoor bar and it gets pretty hot in the summertime.",

    "text": "Went to this restaurant on a Friday night. I haven't been here since it used to be the Road Runner, it looks different now including a very enticing  misted patio that I want to try to sit at next time I go. I probably wouldn't sit on the patio unless it was hair washing night because humidity and my lovely locks do not mix well, but still. The hostesses were nice and tried to help me find my party, but I ended up seeing my friend waving from the corner of my eye and we sat at a giant wooden table. It was high off the ground and could seat eight people so it felt pretty epic to me.   This place is known for their beer club which is totally free to join. I don't like beer, so I didn't join, but if you like beer I think they carry all of them here. Lol. They have a leaderboard of who is drinking the most beers and there are perks and prizes at every level. The club also works between all of their locations which is neat.   I had a pineapple cider which was amazing. I also had a greek salad, which I thought was delicious but probably is not a PKWY Tavern specialty. My boyfriend just had the nachos as his entree and he said he could take them or leave them, but he did think they were better than Nacho Daddy. That isn't a super high bar in my opinion but take what you will from it.   Didn't blow my mind but satisfied my basic needs. I like it! I would probably return less for the food and more for the atmosphere. This seems like a convenient, casual place to chill back with friends and have a few drinks - especially if you like beer! Will be back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

If you like craft beer, this is the place for you. They have a HUGE selection. They also have a great app for their \"TEAM,\" which will track the beers you've tried and also issue you points, which can earn you gift certificates and stuff.

Upon arrival, we were told we had to leave by 9 pm as there is a \"new rule\" in Nevada that prohibits children on patios after 9 pm (although they could not specify the rule). When we left (after the rude bouncer Sean was literally about to physically remove us from the premises because we were a couple minutes after 9), NO ONE was smoking on the patio.    In addition to the foregoing, the food was awful, they were out of beer on the menu and their bar could not handle serving customers when another event was going on.   Bottom line: DO NOT GO HERE.",

It was real busy but raining like hell so we decided to sit outside in a covered spot with only a few drips from above until a table inside opened up. Mark was our server outside who produced an extensive beer menu which we perused at our leisure. The food is better than your average bar food and the drinks were plentiful. The best thing about our experience, however, was Mark. He positioned three heaters around our table to keep us warm. He was by our side the entire time replenishing drinks without being asked, recommending drinks and food, and just generally being a fantastic, considerate, attentive server. We will be back!!",

Inside, well they need to turn up the A/C a bit cooler....  With. 109 degrees outside. A place cool comfortable can make a big difference!    I was greeted by a very friendly hostess. Asked if I was with a party or will be sitting at bye bar. I chose the bar.  I was then greeted by another friendly young lady. Took my drink order and asked if I was interested in looking at a menu.  I said , \"Yes please\".    Menu looked pretty good. They offer a 24/7 breakfast menu.  Very good! I ordered the Beer Battered Mushroom Burger, medium and was cooked to perfection! Only problem I did have was my meal was served in a small deep frying basket.  It was challenging for me to navigate. I needed a little more space on or in my basket to eat. The handle on the basket was in my way.   All in all. Pkwy Tavern is a pretty nice place to watch every type of sporting event. All the employees are friendly and attentive.   I will come back again.  When it cools down outside....",

    "text": "My old stopping grounds!   I used to come here after WAKA games when it was Road Runner and really like that they opened the place up more. A full open courtyard with larger tables and more space to play flip cup, hang by the fire and they added grass.   We were seated at a booth a little bit further inside and were greeted right away by Marissa. She was a great server. We picked a couple beers off the extensive list, put in an order of food and people watched. She was friendly, knowledgeable, she kept the refills coming, got our order correct and cleared our plates all in a timely manner.  We loved the beer selection and the food was good too. We ordered the chicken and waffle sliders, a burger, the fried pickles, potato skins and the buffalo chicken fingers. The sliders were so good! Mini waffle sandwiches with crunchy fried chicken, bacon because of course all topped with as much syrup as your heart desires. The fried pickles were also tasty. Crunchy batter on dill wedges instead of chips. The food all came out promptly with several servers bringing it at once, which I really appreciated. We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie skillet because we didn't feel fat enough. It was delicious. Warm cookie, ice cream and whip cream on top. Get it.   The only negative, which is a pretty big one, is that I noticed when we sat down a small girl under the age of 6 sitting alone in the booth next to us coloring. Our server tried to track down who she belonged to and offered her a water and it turned out she belonged to a woman gambling and drinking AT THE BAR. this woman had left her small child unattended at a booth so she could drink and gamble across the way. Horrible parenting but shame on PKWY for allowing this to happen. This woman knew the hostess because she came over to \"check on\" her daughter and made small talk with the hostess once she saw her daughter was ok. I don't know if she was a family member, manager or just a patron of this place, but to me this was completely unacceptable and I felt terrible for the child. A manager should have noticed and stepped in and if they did know about it and allowed it to happen, that is against the law.",

    "text": "I get it. PKWY Tavern has created an off the strip bar that could potentially cater to a younger crowd that would prefer a cool decor with outdoor activities which you might find in Downtown Las Vegas at The Gold Spike. Good concept - bad execution.   Kim was my server and she was great! She constantly checked in on my table, even for the remaining hour that I sat there not ordering more beer or food.   Beer: As my friend mark stated in a different review of the same establishment, \"there is a lot of beer\", just not good beer. I tried his Dogfish Head 90 minute which he insisted was no good, I agree that that's no 90 minute. It was malty and resembled the taste of any IPA that goes bad over time. I was excited to see that the season Grapefruit Sculpin from Ballast Point was on the beer menu, but unfortunately they ran out. Therefore, I opted for the regular Sculpin.   Food: The best thing on the menu is the buffalo wings. I ordered a burger and it was alright, but it's my opinion that it's too big. They could save some money by making this dish smaller. The worst item was the pulled pork nachos. I was surprised to see that they use fresh jalapenos for their nachos, but I was even more surprised when the dish was served with cold cheese and meat.   Extras: The menu is four one-sided pages clipped to a plastic board. If they are going to continue the sports theme, a few things need to happen. 1. Get rid of the clip boards 2. Make the menus one page and two sided (you can still achieve the \"coach\" look this way 3. Never, and I mean never print another marketing material or menu again that doesn't take up both sides of the paper.",

We didn't have a reservation (it was super busy because football) but they were able to push some tables together to make space for us immediately, right next to a few huge tv screens which was perfect for watching the game! They had some pretty good specials on beer for the football games, although their food specials were lacking. We ordered almost everything off the food specials menu and nothing really stood out, plus the portions were really really small (for bar food). Overall a great experience, just wish the food was better.",

She handled herself well considering the amount of tables she had but it's a shame her management didn't recognize she would need help on such a busy and hot day. It took an hour to order food and another hour and 15 to actually get out good, only to be missing an entire entree which they actually charged us for. We also asked them to open a large umbrella which they agreed to then never did. Management needs to better understand business demands on peak days.",

    "text": "I am writing this review due to a recent event that took place on a Saturday evening. My sister went out with her company to celebrate and they held a private section for their party. My brother, her husband, and I later came to help celebrate her promotion she recently received. My sister already had a few drinks in by the time we got there and we just received our drinks and food. A few minutes in her coworker brought her to our table  and sat for a bit when unfortunately she threw up a little at the table. Her coworker took her to the restroom while the rest of us cleaned up the mess she left, it wasn't a huge mess so a few napkins cleaned up most of it. After she took care of business in the restroom her husband and coworker took her out to the car while my brother and I tried to finish the rest of our food (albeit less than half was eaten).   One of the waitresses came by and asked if we were doing okay and noticed the pile of napkins. We tried to let her know what happened before she picked any of it up and she immediately looked disgusted and walked away. A few minutes later she came back passive aggressively giving us our check when we didn't even ask for it, dropped it off and left without saying anything whatsoever. I apologize now that it was irresponsible what ended up happening on my parties end, but the reaction we receive was downright disrespectful and bullshit. After what happened we didn't even want to finish our food or our drinks, we just paid the bill and left. I am disappointed at the service we received and really hope something will actually be done about this.  Just wanted to come out for a good time. Don't need any bad vibes. If you're gonna have an attitude leave that shit at home not in the \"professional\" scene. I cannot recommend this location to any friends or family looking to have a good time.",

    "text": "I wasn't going to Yelp this place, but kept running into the pictures I took of the awful food.  My daughter ordered the Pizza (Al Pastor), I ordered a salad (dressing on the side), and my husband ordered a burger.  My daughter's pizza was inedible (pictures posted) because the meat was ALL FAT.  My salad came with tons of ranch dressing on it instead of the side, and my husband's burger was just okay.  The worst part was the waitress taking care of us was training someone and when we showed her the pizza she just looked at it and shrugged and gave a limp, \"Sorry\". She then had the girl she was training come back to take the plates with food that obviously had not been eaten a bit later.  We thought maybe they were just comping the pizza at least, but nope.  In the meantime the waitress who was training was goofing off with other employees and customers her age instead of coming back to fill our empty drinks that sat there for 15 minutes.    The place is fun for game day with lots to do, but don't order their food.  It's expensive and lousy.. Just go for the drinks and games if you go and eat beforehand.  Yuck  (My daughter read my review and reminded me they gave us a side of celery, carrots, and ranch dressing and we thought it was just part of the meal and found out we were charged $2.99 for it.  I told the waitress we didn't order that, but ate some not knowing it wasn't just part of the meal, and she still charged us for that too.)",

Out of respect for the bar we got beers then told the server that we love the nachos here & were only here for the nachos. 45 minutes later the server still didn't stop to check on us and we saw four other tables receive their food before us. We had to wave down a busser to call our server over. She was standing at the podium and enjoying the music rather than checking on us. She came over to us a little later and said \"I'm so sorry they're making the chips fresh\".... I said \"what do you mean you could have at least come to check on us it's been over 40 minutes\" she replied \"it not my fault\". We paid for our 2 beers ($20) and left. They could have at least comped a beer off. I didn't even drink it all. We were so hungry by the time, we just couldn't wait any longer. On top of that it's Memorial Day, and you would think it was busy not no! I would understand if it was busy. But proper steps of service would go back and check on your table, check with the kitchen if the food is taking too long and never say it's not my fault, yes it's not your fault but there are ways to soften a hangry customer, offer some snacks something anything, a quick check in would have gone a long way!!!! The parking lot was empty and still the kitchen and server couldn't get their act together.  I've been on my feet all day with very little to eat and on top of that I was behind a bar as well, I know the feeling of pressure, girl u were not busy or under pressure at all, compared to the crap I go through. Learn some service etiquette and don't be so lazy.",

I been here numerous  times and only 2 times have I had amazing service, but those servers are not there anymore  I have a feeling since they are all young women and deal with mainly a younger crowd they think that it's ok to be rude to all customers. Well the server staff word get out quick on the internet and if you keep it up, not only will your consumers stop coming in so to not so good reviews but also the ones that do will already know you suck at your jobs. So that will decline in you making your money.  I do however apologize to the bartending staff since they are always kind and at times hilarious.

She rolled her eyes at us when she had to come back because we didn't know what we wanted to drink.

Yes a Parkway Tavern, as in, not a fine dining establishment or even a bar and grill much less anything upscale. Their claim to fame and unique value proposition is that it serves 250 beers. OK so I haven't verified the claim myself but they do have a \"shipload\" of beers.  (I'm on beer 16... I think...I know Amanda has been telling me to log them) I've had a different one every time. Amanda is doing a great job BTW always prompt service on top of everything. The space has an open and airy feel which seems very well lit. I found plenty of seating space, every Friday night, inside or outside on the patio even during VGK games. It draws a good crowd mostly younger people looking to get a buzzin good time to get the weekend started. Food is very good for a tavern style food. I mean I didn't have a bad bite, and I've ordered and eaten everything off their happy hour Menu. Then again I'm not expecting \"cleaver steakhouse\" level steak tartare or \"IL Mulino\" branzino. All these characters posting 1 star or 2 star reviews commenting on the size of burgers or the dryness of pork in their slider...get over yourselves and order another beer with that burger so it goes down easier! While you're at it realize you're in a tavern eating tavern food and drinking beer, not experiencing a fine dining haute cuisine experience. It's hands down a 5 star tavern establishment with 250 beers.",

I like lemonade and I like iced tea, so might as well have both at the same time!  *Hero Burger* The only thing that made it a \"hero\" was that it was served on a toasted hoagie roll instead of the traditional burger buns. Otherwise it was a pretty standard burger. It came with a choice of side and I went with tater tots! I can never say no to tater tots!  The service was nice, quick, and friendly. We were a pretty big group and she did a great job making sure we had everything we needed.  Overall with decent food and good service, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again. Even though I don't drink alcohol anymore, I did see some of my old favorites (e.g. Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Ballast Point Sculpin IPA) on their tap list. They had a very decent selection of beers available.",

    "text": "PKWY Tavern has evolved from Roadrunner to cater to the college crowd. It's essentially the Gold Spike of the west side. There's corn hole, beer pong, darts, billiards, giant jenga and connect four, and even a miniature bowling alley. However, their main selling point is 250+ beers to choose from which I LOVE! I've had the opportunity to order food and can say everything I've ordered is quality considering it's mainly bar food. But the downside to such an awesome place..  It was only a matter of time before pkwy tavern got too popular for its own good. Thinking about coming here on a weekend? Forget about enjoying yourself. If you enjoy muscling your way to the front of the bar to order a drink then having no where to stand, then come on a Friday or Saturday night. Being a college friendly bar, I've seen too many examples of customers who should've been cut off from the bar a long time ago.  There's nothing like PKWY Tavern on this side of town, and the beer selection is unmatched. I like this place, but it's hard to enjoy myself when there's literally no room for your own personal space. I almost wouldn't mind if they started charging a cover on the weekends.",

The food is tasty, although it is probably bad for you, but that's OK because what are you expecting anyway.  I recommend the chicken fingers they are good, I also recommend the nachos, those were pretty yummy as well.   If you are there for beers you will probably be OK with the selection they have. However if you are there for well drinks Move on, find another place. Their drinks are watered down. Although the prices seem to be OK on those well drinks, the reality is that you're not getting much of a punch out of them.  And while their food and craft beer selection is pretty good, this was such a disappointing aspect of this place I was really hoping for something a little better on those well drinks.   I gave them two stars because of their service and because of their pretty decently tasting food. However I had a big issue with their well drinks.",

If you are expecting, at the very least,  decent food and service, you will be sorely disappointed.  Our poor waitress forgot which beers we ordered twice, had to send my nachos back once and brought full pints for my wife when she continued to order 1/2 pints.  This was our first time here and we would not be compelled to come back as there are other bars closer to home that operate \"better\" as a bar.  To top it all off, it appears payroll checks were being handed out during service. Is that normal? I would hope not as it is unprofessional to me (do it in the back, behind the scenes).

Wouldn't mind that much, except they weren't that busy, and I watched someone else sit, order the same thing and be served before I ever saw my food.   The chicken on the flatbread was getting cold, and the nachos were room temp. To make the nachos worse, they were dry as hell, since the cheese was cooked to a crisp and they had been sitting out.

    "text": "The establishment centers it's hype around having 250 types of beer. Either 100 on tap and 150 bottled beers or vice versa.  This used to be The Roadrunner Cowboy location. Much of the decor has been upgraded and changed out. There are some reminders of the old bar such as the RR is still used as door handles and other small things. The men's urinals are defiantly one creative addition. Right when you walk in there is a sign posted that states no smoking and yep as you guessed it, it didn't stop anyone from smoking, the dining area is separated from the bar area by a half wall and some beams so the smoke cruises right into the food area. They sport a lot of TV's for various sporting events. Glass style garage doors allow for air to flow through the premise to an atrium style are where one might toss some corn-holes around.  At 7:30pm The crowd was very light but had a wide age range mix, 20's all the way up to mid 60's plus. Heard two elderly gentlemen in their mid sixties actually complain because there weren't enough women and actually asked if there's a ladies night...I feel bad for you 20-40 something women these two sharks are on the prowl.  The reason it's receiving 2 stars today is they only had about 20 beers on tap. If your establishment centers around a product or type of product you dang well better deliver day one when you open. Could you imagine Disneyland opening up and only offering balloons and food and wild toads magic ride, no Mattahorn, Space or thunder Mountain? The bar definitely is now set up for over 100 drafts. So when we asked two employees when the draft/250 beers is going to be available they both said they had no idea, in fact they seemed irritated like they were tired of people asking. The beer selection was mediocre their one wheat beer was blue moon and they had one IPA.  I will not be back until it's confirmed they have all the other brews available. Once this happens then it will give other establishments that offer a lot of different types a beer ( Aces&Ales/ Yardhouse) a run for its money. I will also most likely change my rating of this place once they are actually open.",

The ugly: The Dogfish Head 90-minute pint I ordered tasted awful - either bad lines (which would be strange for a new place) or old beer (also strange for a new place), not sure which. Sent it back. First server (before awesome Kim) seemed confused by the menu, and not helpful. His shift was ending - which turned out to be good for both of us.  Ordered nachos with pulled pork. Both the pulled pork and cheese sauce were ice cold when the nachos arrived. Sent them back. Burgers were just okay, served on a very large, dry bulkie roll.

The reason this is not a five star review is because there was a booth with four women next to us and all four of them lit up cigarettes at the same time. I wish they wouldn't allow smoking where the food is.",

But the best thing is the fact that they carry a large selection of beers, 250 to be exact.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back. They have an outside patio with games like beer pong, jenga and bags.  Food wise you will find normal bar food. There was nothing extraordinary except for the loaded fries! You can never go wrong with that!  I'm glad to finally see a cool bar in the summerlin area. Good prices and good atmosphere.",

    "text": "Toto, we aren't in Downtown Las Vegas anymore! PKWY Tavern reminds me of Gold Spike. I dub it, \"Gold Spike on the West.\" You step foot in here and it's like whoa, we aren't in DTLV but it sure does have a Gold Spikey vibe to it.   I love Gold Spike so that certainly is not a bad thing.  Nonetheless, I like PKWY Tavern for two main reasons:  1) It's on the West side :) Ergo, it's more local and closer to my house. 2) BEER -- SO MUCH BEER. MUCH. SELECTION.  You can find this located off of 215 and Flamingo next to the LVAC. You can actually see the building as you drive by the freeway, so you really can't miss it.   Its ambience is just like Gold Spike -- casual, fun, quirky, relaxed. Tons of things to keep you busy here including games like jenga and bowling. It has a younger crowd/vibe going on to keep it lively.  This place advertises its 250+ selection of beers. Talk about \"all you can drink.\" If you ARE on this side of town and like to frequent bars, I recommend joining their loyalty program. They have rewards for customers that drink x amount of different kinds of beer! And yes, I do mean you can get things like t-shirts and mugs, but I was told that you can get your own personalized party if you are that hardcore!  Their selection of beers means that there is one for EVERY single person. I like beer, but I LOVE cider. With that said, all you cider lovers should get the raspberry cider! I can't get enough of it.  Besides all that, service here was kind of slow and the bartenders on the inside seemed like they didn't want to be there. Regardless, I did have a great time with my friends here and will be coming back! You just need to bring your patience as the service always seems to be a little on the slow side.",

The food is a great accompaniment to getting drunk because it is loaded with carbs but not too greasy. Happy Hour highlights are the corn fritters (do not miss these), and the cheese sticks. Get a booth cause you will be waiting for a while, but what you actually get is a very good value for the money.",

The place is huge and open. And it's usually packed full of people. So get there early if you're wanting good seats.   If you're not coming here for UFC or some other event, there are games to play and just good seating to come with a group to chill.   The service was good and they also have a huge selection of beers on tap, in a can or in the bottle. But their tap selection was impressive.   The only reason why I gave it 3 stars: Their food. It's pretty meh. It's your typical bar food. Which I suppose is to be expected. And if that's what you're looking for, that's great. If not, you're going to pay for some cheap ingredient food that's probably better tasting when you're drunk. There are some awesome bars in Vegas with great food and drinks.  The Cuban was okay. They hardly had any pork on it, and the ham tasted like pre-packaged deli meat. It was cold as well. The wings were very overcooked and too crispy.

It was a super fun sports bar to check out and they had a wide selection of games. My friends and I played the jumbo jenga and beer pong (ask the servers inside for cups and balls!) Bless these types of bars with games because they make getting drunk 10x more fun. My friends and I ordered beers and various appetizers to share. They have a wide selection of beers and their appetizers were quite tasty. We shared the mini corndogs, beer poached wings with buffalo sauce, and fries. Perfect drunchies!  Overall, I really enjoyed the relaxed and fun vibe of PKWY Tavern. It was a really great alternative to hanging out on the crowded/noisy strip, and a lot cheaper too!",

    "text": "This is a cool place for the younger crowd and sports fans. TVs everywhere to watch a multitude of sports. I love the fact that they have games to play (e.g. huge Connect Four, Beer Pong, bowling, pool, etc...)  The food is great and reasonably priced. I'm a huge fan of the Firecracker Shrimp which is less than $7. I keep reading these reviews about the security and I must say, it's all wrong from my personal experience there. Yes, they seem very serious but what people fail to realize, they're there to protect the guests. I have seen them kick people out but it was definitely warranted. When people get drunk, they tend to grow a set and get out of hand sometimes. It doesn't matter what race someone is, I see them treat everyone equally. My friends that go there said the security is very friendly but if you get out of hand, they have no problems handling the situation.  As for the rest of the place, it's definitely a chill place to hang out on the weekends. The two Irish bartenders are Awesome and very entertaining. I would highly recommend visiting this place, at least once and form your own opinions.  After all, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and if they had a bad experience, I'd ask, well what did you do to deserve it. I do admit, service sucks a little, then again, it all depends on who you get as your server. Some are very attentive and there are some who are not. FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS!!!",

Even though it's right off the 215, it's really well insulated from noise with their courtyard. There are tons of games to play while you sip one of 50+ beers on tap. Darts, arcade games, cornhole, beer pong, Jenga, bowling, and more. Definitely worth stopping on, especially during happy hour.",

    "text": "Came in tonight for a highly anticipated NBA finals rematch with some friends in the industry. Place was busy as usual. Service was terribly unacceptable. Server took our drink order. After nearly 20 minutes later our drinks were delivered to our table and some were missing. Manager who delivered the drinks used profanity while commenting how \"the server doesn't know how to ring in drinks.\" Found that really offensive and unprofessional. Manager came back to drop drinks off, now everyone finally had a beverage. Server came back with another round of drinks stating that \"guess this was a double order.\" We finally placed our food order. Food took over 30 minutes we timed it. When our food finally came, we all were so hungry we forced ourselves to eat the items ordered because we were obviously that hungry and to just bare the dryness of our sliders and chicken wraps we requested more sauce. It was obvious our food sat in the back for a long period of time. No apology, no follow up from the manager. When the bill came which was the most awkward part of the dinner we realize that all of our meal was charged to us. Find that kind of odd how nothing was addressed or done to make up for such a horrible display of service and management. Didn't want to come here to begin with, but after tonight it will indeed be the last. Explains why the business is at a 3 star ranking. Actually find that inaccurate. Cheap food, cheap drinks, below par service. Suggestion, bring on more staff for peak nights, address customer issues, take care of your locals.",

After just looking at him he comes back I place my order again, a yung lady appears next to me and all services turned to her. Come on! I thought he need a good tip after two drinks and I gave him a ten. When we where done playing the beanbag game I go up to the same bartender witch happen to be there again looks at me with the beanbags to grab my license but wait? Of course another yung lady appears after I was waiting for 5 minutes ignores me. Makes the yung lady her drink looks at me again I'm thinking that good tip I gave him he might be nicer nope looks at the guy next to me and walks away to the other end of the bar well would you look again pretty girls at the end of the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbar.me&s=ab12ae6540e1168d09ed5e758daee22c7ee9dd6857c1fa091bc80424660e07ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bar.me</a> and the other guy waiting for his order just walks away. Not what I would expect from a bar that has everything but customer service!! Do not get me wrong there is good bartenders but that one needs to get classes for customer service or needs another job. I will be going back but not to that bartender.. less flirting more working bud! Sorry tavern it only takes one!",

The service was terribly slow and when we asked questions about the happy hour it took over 5 min to get an answer. No fault to the waitress who was new (but isn't this restaurant pretty new?) I put blame on the managers who don't train the staff properly and when there are only 4 tables occupied in the whole place you should at least touch every one and see how things are going. We were going to order food but we just wanted to get out of there so I can't comment on that.

    "text": "The service was terrible! Walked in and stood at the host desk for a few minutes and was not contacted by any employees. Two employees were out in the patio area (not far from where we were standing) smoking and drinking alcohol. We decided to seat ourselves. Table was sticky. Two waitresses walked by and did not say a word. There were only two other families in the dining area, so it's not like they were busy. Finally the third waitress stopped. She brought our menu's; they were nastier then the table! Mine was so sticky that there were a few pieces of human hair stuck to the front. The inside had some yellow substance dried on it. Looked like nacho cheese. We were ready to place our order, however the waitress kept walking by and looking the other way when she passed us. We were finally able to place our order. I ordered \"Smoked\" prime rib and my wife ordered Mahi Mahi sandwich. It took 30 minutes (not exaggerating) for us to get our food. Mind you the dining area was empty as earlier mentioned. Furthermore, we had a view into the kitchen and there was a burger sitting window waiting to be served for approximately 15 minutes. Meanwhile the group of employees (some of whom appeared to be management) continued drinking and smoking out in the patio. My prime rib (if you can call it that) was extremely oily! I've never had any meat that was smoked come out oily... It tasted like processed meat. NASTY! The Mahi Mahi was extremely dry and rubbery! As we ate, our glasses were empty as servers continued to walk by ignoring our empty glasses. Most of our meals were still on our plates when we placed our napkins on our plates. Indicating we were done. The waitress came over and I assumed she would ask how everything was. Not so much. She grabbed our plates and I asked for our check. She brought the check right back. Fastest service we had all afternoon! Needless to saw we will NOT ever step foot back in that place. It's always packed at night when we drive by, so we decided to give it a shot. It's definitely not packed for its food or service! I gave this place one star because zero stars was not an option!!!",

We sat ourselves in a booth in the main inside area and waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged/given menus. The waitress automatically started off with a piss poor attitude. We saw a Placard on the table that had happy hour specials during 'football games', so since there was a game on, we assumed it was happy hour right? No. Only what they deem as 'important games' constitute happy hour prices.  We got a condescending remark from the waitress and said she'd be back. Then when we ordered \"$1 vodka and punch shots\" as advertised by our waitress, she came back and said they were actually 2 for $3. At this point we're all already pissed off and had ordered a pizza. We ordered three rounds of 2 shots. She came back with 2 rounds of 2 shots and a hell of an attitude. We decided to bother a different waitress to cancel our pizza order. I am a manager of a cafe and I would fire anyone who treated nice customers like she treated us. She treated us like we were somehow infringing on her evening. Don't go here.",

We were greeted immediately by our bartender (Amber) who promptly offered us the \"Beer Menu\" and after making our choices, she immediately informed us about their Brew T.E.A.M. membership.  After a quick sign-up we were given our free PKWY t-shirts.  Cool!  We then ordered Potato Skins that came quickly and they were hot, crispy and delicious.  The atmosphere in the bar itself is very open and has very interesting lighting all consisting of different beer bottles.  There are lots of games to play and even board games on the tables.  And for the guys there is an interesting twist in the restroom (according to my husband).  Overall a great first experience.  We will be back.

We asked if they could change one on our side - they said no because they \"have to keep the in-house advertisements on the screen\" .. yeah I'm already here, I don't need to see your advertisements.  Also, you could have switched out with one of the TVs on the other side of the room if you actually gave a shit about your customers.  Then, and this is my favorite part, it took them 90 minutes to get us a plate of 5 mozzarella sticks.  **90 MINUTES!!**  Another table came in 20 mins after us - they received a round of drinks, then their appetizers, then their entrees ... while we still sat there with just drinks.  They had 7 people at their table, we had 2.  Tell me how you managed that??  After pointing out to our server that everything about our experience sucked, he finally sent the manager over.  She told us \"they made a mistake on your order\".  It took 90 minutes to get 1 plate of mozz sticks - thats not a \"mistake\", thats incompetent management.  It took close to 2 hours to get our entrees.  Even if you screwed up our order (1 sandwich, 1 hamburger) how tf did it take you almost 2 hours to serve a friggin hamburger??  The manager half-assed apologized and did comp the food it took 2 hours to get, but I'll never come here again.  I don't mind a mistake, but 2 hours to get a burger at a bar is a fucking joke - never happens at PTs.  There didn't seem to be a shortage of staff either.  Plenty of people walking around doing next to nothing.  Oh, and btw, when we finally did get our food, it wasn't even hot.  How did you manage that??",

When our food came there were no utensils, napkins, or condiments. My friend had to go and get our items herself. Another person ordered a Pepsi around 7:10 and no joke did not receive it until 7:50. When the waitress finally would come around everyone treated her like a unicorn and was trying to get her attention. If they were short staff the guys handing out the food should have helped out. When we asked for water they were like ask your waitress.   Everyone at the table was upset with the service but still had a good time around the game. This place has a lot of potential to be awesome but need to work on customer service and execution of large events.",

    "text": "So you could come to PKWY and have two completely different experiences depending on the time of day/night that you come.  Let's start with the positive things here that don't change though: they have a TON of beers (and good ones), they have decent food, the staff is always friendly, and they are a craft beer bar that is located in a part of town where there aren't many choices in the area of beer. Seriously though, have you ever tried to find a cool crafty beer spot or brewery when in summerlin!?!...it's like your only option.   If you make it here during daylight for a bit of day off day drinking, it's super fun! Chill ambiance, lots of attention from bartenders, good solid crowd. A great place to hang with some friends and enjoy a day baseball game on tv.   If you happen to get here after about 8pm...like any night...you better either be in college, or really want to go back to that time in your life when you had no responsibilities, no money and no manners...because this bar legit turns into a 25 and under establishment very quickly. Not that there's anything wrong with young drinkers...but nothing will make you feel old more than a ravenous group of kids acting like it's spring break, and spilling drinks on your Givenchy handbag.",

I've waited way too long for service every single time I've come here. In fact, I don't think there was a single time I waited at the bar for under 15 minutes to order a drink, no matter how busy or slow the bar was. The bartenders are rude, unless they're flirting with you, which is apparently the only way to order a drink here. So if you're not a model, you may never get to order. Oh, and it's also extremely loud and crowded after 10pm. You might as well go to a nightclub because that's the type of atmosphere this bar gives.",

Well once I did, I went back the very next day :) Let's see, the things I enjoyed: - Pretzel with beer cheese - warm + salty = perfect! - Breakfast pizza - the dough is perfectly fluffy and the egg makes all of the difference. Loaded with cheese too. - Pepperoni pizza - I missed the egg but the cheesiness made up for it. - Fried mushrooms - YAASSS!! They were small mushrooms, each deep friend. Not cut up portobello fries like everywhere else. - Buffalo wings - comes with fries. Really good flavor and good sized. Non food - All of the games. - Extensive beer menu. - Separate sitting areas. - Awesome staff. - Fast service. Now the things that are, Meh - Cuban sandwich - it's just OK. I may have had overly high expectations since someone told me it was amazing. - Lack of specialty drinks. I realize it's a beer spot but with everything else it offers, specialty drinks would seal the deal!",

But if you are just looking for a great hangout place with decently priced beer and bar food then this is a great place to go.   We went for happy hour and I thought service was good. We hung out a bit after we finished our meal and they told us to take our time but cleared out our table super fast. Usually I like some food to be left on the table. Even if we stopped eating now doesn't mean I won't munch on it 30 mins later so I wished they weren't so efficient at taking away all of our plates and utensils before we even paid the bill.   I thought some of the food was pretty decent. Standard happy hour fried fare. The tator tots and mini corn dogs were good. Nice and crispy. The hh wings were a good portion size too. However I ordered the pork belly tacos and didn't enjoy them. The skin wasn't cooked enough so it was rubbery and super tough. Basically inedible so I had to take it out. The tacos came with only the pork belly, a balsamic tasting sauce and vinegared onions. I wished the condiments were different.",

Only suggestion would be more attentive. Totally understand we were there to watch the game and the server probably didn't want to interrupt, but she never came over to check on us and see if we wanted anything to eat after she dropped off our drinks. Suggesting apps/food increases the bill which increases the overall tip. Other than that I still suggest this bar to everyone.",

The rest of the local bars all seem to be here and only give you the time of day if you're making big wins and handing out big tips. If you're just drinking... ignored for the most part. Not here tho!!!!!!! Let me tell ya about this these tenders. Bruce and Karla (with a K!!) are fantastic. Always say hi, always give the BEST service; quick, attentive, and just all around the reason I end up swingin' in after shift. I'm a bartender from Cali so we didn't have gaming and it was always service forward so coming here was quite the shock. These two and a couple others (Justin? I think was his name) are all about the customer and make me feel right at home. Thanks guys for always being F-in best!!! Xoxo   Heads up if you wanna party go on a Friday/Saturday.

You need a place in this immediate area with a huge list of beers.  2. You are with a group of friends looking to play corn hole, beer pong, darts, shuffleboard, bowling, ping pong and board games in an accommodating front lawn meets patio environment bar.  The food is typical bar fare...nothing special...nothing worth coming in for. The beers are ample but overpriced. The staff is not trained or educated on the extensive list of beers so it's not a great place to explore beers or breweries that you're not familiar with.  Fans of the old Road Runner that was previously in this location probably won't like this younger feel and crowd PKWY is catering to.  I can understand the 1 stars reviews, but the bar games in the nice inside/outside patio setting and beer list are enough to bump it up a star in my mind...but you won't find me rushing back here.",

The food is okay, it's your typical bar food. Their drinks on the other hand are very reasonably priced and the service was very quick. Our waitress was seriously a ninja, our drinks would appear without her presence. The crowd is kind of weird because it's a lot of older cougars preying on younger boys and old men.

Came here to watch the UFC fight with some friends, we heard they don't charge cover so figured we'd check it out. Got there really early and were told everything was reserved except for the outside bar, so we sat there. It was really hot at 4:30 on an August day, so we did try to get something inside, but the staff wasn't very interested and just said we were out of luck for anything inside, which is understandable since it was a fight night, but I do think they could have been nicer about it. Anyway we almost left and went somewhere else because we were so hot, but we decided to stick it out and I'm glad we did. Soon after people started piling in and we realized that we actually had prime real estate! It ended up getting packed! They really needed 2 bartenders behind that bar instead of 1. For food I had the shredded chicken wrap and it was really good. My friends all got a hot dog/fries/PBR special for $7. We also signed up for their beer club and got free t-shirts. This was a great place to watch the fight and I would come back again.",

And a cup of water was free.  In the past year, they've changed for the worst. The Friday night DJ sucks, plays literally nothing but 90s and early 2000s rap all night, and when asked why he doesn't play anything newer, will say because \"most of it is trash anyway.\" Very seldom are people as active in dancing as they were before.   Oh and worst of all, they've started charging for water. Now, I don't drink, which bestows upon me automatic DD duties. So now I have to pay $4 for a bottle of water with my sober self that they used to give me in a cup for free. It's almost as if they're encouraging drunk driving and trying to get a dram shop liability lawsuit.   Oh and the food is a solid 6/10.",

Or better yet, your international guests can get a grasp of the American college lifestyle by stopping by pkwy tavern.   I entered into this mad house and was surprised how the entire college campus had migrated over to this one establishment. Where did they come from? It's a flashback to sorority/fraternity parties. At the entry, you see people smoking as though they're in their college house backyard, then there's the groups of boys at beer pong tables.   A great place for the 21-25 year old age range, but you'll find yourself in a nostalgic state otherwise.   I love that they have different games available. I saw Jenga. It's a fun environment if you come with a good group of friends. Drinks on tap were vast in selection. Prices are slightly on the steeper end.   We got plastic cups after they ran out of real glass. Talk about a True fraternity party. The only difference was that they were clear cups, not the red solos.   I'd come back here again to play a game, but I'd rather do that at home. Service was average, and the mango habanero wings were okay.",

Even after asking the hostess if there was anyone covering our section, and being reassured that there was indeed someone, we proceeded to wait another 10 min. and of course were not even acknowledged... Walked out never being served.  Would not recommend this place at all.",

The idea of having a card to use each time I drink a beer to go towards a free item is genius!  This will be my weekly spot!",

The 2 newest irish bartenders Nick & Nial are a blast while sitting at their bar, very friendly and try to give the best service possible while being extremely busy.

Calling me a faggot and many other things. I just overlooked it but my best friend is a very passionate person. I tried my darndest to hold her back because really what some asshole says doesn't matter to me. This asshole GOT OUT OF HIS CAR AND PUSHED HER TO THE GROUND. Now I'm a VERY mom-confrontational sort of guy, never been in a fight and this was all so surreal. Her boyfriend went over to this guy who was bigger than all three of us and he started getting wailed on! I ran up behind him and got him from behind to the ground when the security came out. We tried to explain what happened and that HE ATTACKED A SMALL 110 LB FEMALE, They said he was a regular at the bar and that he would never say such things. So we left and they let him stay. We were leaving anyways but it's the principle. Up to that point the bar was very fun. Pretty pricey but I enjoyed it. I could never go back to a place that supported homophobia the way that they did.",

I mean, I could see slow service due to a large capacity of guests. But, when my friends and I got there, the tables were barely filled... We were sat at a table and were pretty much forgotten about. Sat there for over 25min. Got a bit fed up so we asked for someone to help us take some orders. It took another 10-15min. for someone to tend to us... Not too pleased with my first visit here...

Great beer selections, reasonable prices, rotating selections, and dozens of TVs offering any sporting event you're into, local or not.  The thing I learned about PKWY is that the best way to get service is to sit at the bar.  Sitting outside will be tough to get a waitress' attention.  Sitting at a table inside is hit or miss.  At the bar, no trouble at all.    The staff is relatively knowledgable about the beer offerings and the food is the typical bar food.  The place itself has a very laid-back, playful vibe with darts, bowling, ping pong, and games.  This will be my new summer hangout spot in town, just remember to go to the bar to order.",

    "text": "I have heard good things about this place, and when I finally got to try the place out, nothing really impressed me. It was a local version of Gold Spike.  Their service failed me the most. The bar was chaotic, but I understand. Its a bar on a saturday night. But we tried to sit at one of their tables while we were waiting for the rest of the group, but no one showed up a good time. It seemed like a waiting area where no one is available to attend you at all. Funny thing is there was no one at the door when we walked in, so we never got our IDs checked either the whole night. However, finally a server shower up, but there was no greeting or anything. So if you are here to actually grab something to eat and have some drinks, go to PT's or yardhouse where they actually serve you. This place wasnt so ideal for table seating.   Two good sides of this place was that it seemed like people cant smoke, at leadt indoor. I dont think i actually smelled cigarette there. But maybe it could have just been that night. Also their drinks were pretty reasonably priced. Irish car bombs and AMFs were 8 dollars each. Not so bad.   I would come back if there is a large group of friends wanting to hang out, but it wouldnt really be a place for me to give frequent visits to. But overall, it had good vibes, i just wish they offered friendlier service to their patrons.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this place. I came because I read the reviews saying this place was like Goldspike. I also read the reviews saying that this place had terrible service, but thought to myself, \"It can't be that bad, right??\"  Well I was wrong. The visit started very pleasantly. Ordered the fried pickles and Jalapeno Popper Egg Rolls. Poppers were waaaay too cheesy. Decided to order a beer. Waitress comes back to tell me that they no longer offer the beer I ordered, no big deal. Order another and am introduced to the PKWY App where you can log your beers for prizes. Instantly get excited for this and download the app. First order goes great and I pay my tab and have everything logged. And then things started to spiral.  Go inside and start another tab. Ask about how to play some of the games around the bar, none of the wait staff knew how they worked, cost, etc. Ordered a few more drinks before the waitress serving me let me know her shift was ending and asked if she could close out with me. I did so that I could throw a tip her way and asked about logging the stuff I ordered. She assured me that she would log all of it as she took my money and promptly left. I eventually managed to find another waitress and asked if she could log everything for me, since I wanted credit for what I had bought and also wanted to leave. After waiting 20 minutes for her to find an Ipad to log everything, she informed me that she was unable to log anything because I had already been checked out.  It seems to me that if your gimmick is logging beers and giving away prizes, you'd have the method down to a science. It honestly seems like the wait staff is instructed to make it as hard as possible to decrease the amount of prizes that the bar has to give out. Shady business. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Meh.  This place reminds me of Gold Spike except stupidly more crowded and 101347982374% worse service. I mean, the cool thing about it is it's a different environment, that's all. Yes, apparently they have over 250 beers (I say apparently because 1) I obviously didn't try them all - even though I felt like I had the next day - and 2) I've read that the '250 beers' thing isn't True since most of the time they are \"out\" of a lot beers) and there are games and whatnot but it didn't really set itself apart from other places I've been to.  I was surprised to see tables available when we got there since the parking lot was full and people were parked in red zones next to fire hydrants. We got moved around a bit because there was a larger party that needed two tables put together and unfortunately we get sat at the table that has something spilled on the floor and I was wearing flip-flops so my foot was sticky :( It took about 15 mins to get anyone's attention so I could have a wet cloth because ew.  Our waitress wasn't...bad...except the service was stupidly slow. Like, I had to ask for a beer three times before I got one. My friend's boyfriend got the wrong beer. Someone else at the table didn't like the beer, period (the name was Icky...go figure). It was loud, the tables were crowded. There were people playing beer pong at tables that weren't even meant for beer pong.You're allowed to smoke in some areas but those areas are where the corn hole and bar are located so if you're going to smoke, expect to be uncomfortable and watch out for the flying bean sacks (or is it corn)? I think for the price - seven beers and our bill was $62 - definitely not worth it. I mean, I'd come back if I had to but I wouldn't be too excited about it.",

    "text": "Came to PKWY Tavern one night with a group of coworkers. What is great about PKWY Tavern is that they have a huge list of beers. So if you're a beer loving person, this place is for you! What's even better is that they have a list of beers that constantly rotate every so often. They also have large sized games for you and your group of friends to play with -- it's pretty much like Gold Spike.   When we went, I only had two glasses of beer. I didn't bother to try their food so I can't say how their food is. The different selection of beers was amazing. The service, on the other hand, is horrible. Service is REALLY slow. I would probably suggest that if you just want a drink, just order and pay for it at the bar. It's much faster even if you have to take the time to squeeze into the bar area.   Not only was the service slow, our particular waitress was a little sarcastic with some people in our party .. so that was definitely not appreciated.   I personally would probably not return here unless my friends or coworkers want to go. I didn't really care for the atmosphere -- it was really rowdy. It made me feel like I was at Mcfaddens.   They also have a rewards program, sort of. But you can only get credit for five beers a day and the beer needs to be different. You can't order the same beer five times and get full credit. If you get a certain amount of points, you get a free party or something to that nature. But hey, free to join and beer!",

Yes, it's a little nuts with lots of customers and 20 simultaneous sporting events and indoor-outdoor spaces full of random bar games (even ping pong) - but if you know that going into this, you should have a great time. Just watch out for stray balls, darts, and cornhole bags.  PKWY's food is measurably better than decent - it's actually *good* and a *good value*, surprisingly. From some of the early Yelp reviews I was deceived into thinking otherwise. Since when is $2.95 for a delicious personal basket of sweet potato tots \"pricey\". Sheesh! That's like 1990s prices, and like totally awesome. Stay home, uber-cheapos!  The grilled chicken on the happy hour salad was actually *warm* and tender and perfectly seasoned. Blue cheese dressing was very chunky and quality; delicious.   Hundreds of craft beers are also very reasonably priced ($4.50-$7ish). Funny, a Bud Light is also $5, but in a way maybe that's PKWY's way of saying, \"Don't order Bud Light, asshole\"? Whoever said the beers here are \"expensive\" must be referring to the domestic light beer pricing, which is the *same* as a craft beer. So what? Shouldn't be an issue. Tailgate all the Bud Light out of your F-150 in the parking lot, and then come in and have a Ballast Point something-or-other.  Cheers and welcome to the neighborhood, PKWY!",

Of course it got loud and I told the bartenders what happened and they said they'll handle it.  You know how they handled it? They kicked all of us out! Not to pull the racial card but they kicked all of us Asians out! The bouncer told us they will kick those guys out once we left. Come to find out that they never got kicked out when it was their fault?   I don't understand at all why we had to leave when it was their fault?

Parkway had some of the best bar food around and what a novel concept with a bar with a bowling alley and so many bar games.  However, I have been three times within the past 4 months and it has been a different story.  They changed the menu and food is not as good.  It is so hard to get served.  On one trip, the waitress brought the bill and never came back, so I went to the bar and paid it.    My last and final visit was on September 17, 2016.  I was seated by the hostess in the bar area around 4pm.  There were not that many patrons in the place.  There was ample staff working.  I sat for 15 minutes and never got service.  I told the hostess that this was the third time that I had experienced issues with getting served and I would not be back.  She just said she was sorry.  I am too. Not sure sure if there is new management but the place has went down.  There are too many other awesome choices for food and fun in Las Vegas.",

There were lamps and chandeliers made of recycled beer bottles.  Most of the larger, bench-style tables have random board-games for everyone to play with.  We played operation. Haha.

I tried the mexican chocolate peanut butter beer and it was amazing. I also tried the mango cider and it was BOMB!The prices were also very reasonable. -vibe and location: it is a fun bar with outside patio and games. Very good location for groups and watching sport events.  Not so great things: - it is very busy most of the times it cause some difficulties like you have 3-4 different servers while you stay there. They are constantly asking you what is the name on the tab or if you have one, they dont really know if you were playing or not, cant keep track on the complimentary drinks. Every member of the staff is really nice its just hard for them to keep track among so many people.   - if you dont arrive in time means 2hours before the event you will probably wont be seated. Reservations highly recommended!   -fries :(( they were a disappointment, really soggy and burnt :(   All in all i had a great experience, i will definitely come back to try more",

Yes the crowd tends to get rowdy and somewhat ratchet at times, but there's still nothing quite with the same vibe and feel as PKWY on the southwest side of town.   I came here for the Superbowl and the Stanley cup playoffs and this place was packed for both! I highly recommend making a reservation for big games to ensure you have a table. They typically do fun promos during big games like beer towers or free shots. On typical football games they have a menu with some drink & food specials. If you have a larger group you can ask to sit in the red room and they'll put your team on in there for you.  The food is consistently pretty good. They change their menu up quite often, but some of my recent favorites are the Jalapeno Popper Eggrolls and the Veggie Burger. They feature a happy hour from 4-7 pm during the weekdays and offer discounts to the medical field workers.   The service is hit or miss, sometimes our waitress is outstanding and super friendly and other times it's a disaster. It's sort of a roll of the dice on that aspect. I recommend reviewing your receipt each time to make sure they charged you correctly for everything.   Don't forget to sign up for their rewards app & log your beers too! You can win free beers and sometimes promo t shirts!",

    "text": "Soooooo they have Golden Monkey (my favorite beer) which automatically makes them a favorite in my book. It's also pretty busy most weekend nights, especially Saturday. And even as big as this place is, it still gets packed. Both bars can be busy but the bartenders are awesome.  There is an inside and outside bar area so there's plenty of room to move around should you want to. There are two mini bowling lanes indoor and some games outside like Connect Four, Bag Toss and so on. Last night the Dj was outside but I've seen them indoors as well. There are lots of tables to fit groups and plenty of room at the bar. Like I said though, it's busy so spots fill up quick.   I LOVE that they have so many beers on tap! It's not crazy expensive but it's definitely more affordable than other places in Vegas. Honestly, the food is okay from what I've had. I tried the pretzel last night and it was good but I wouldn't go to PKWY specifically for food. Also, I really like that they offer brunch with bottomless mimosas. When I last went though it was definitely not one of the cheaper brunch options!  Overall, it's a fun bar if you want to get away from the strip and/or want a bar to visit that's not divey. If you're looking for some place to turn up, wait until Friday or Saturday night. I'm sure you could catch some games here as well since there are TVs everywhere.",

One of my friends who's a local brought me here to hangout. He swore I'd like the beer selections and he was right. 250 beers on tap to get through, I have my work cut out for me. For the most part this was an IPA night with Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and New Belgium Voodoo Ranger making the bulk of my drinks.   I wasn't going to have a night of beers without at least one pint of Modern Times so grabbed a City Of The Sun as well.   In addition to good beers the atmosphere was awesome even with the ice cold weather. The music was great, the crowd was live and there was lots of games going on ranging from giant Jenga towers to skee ball, to beer pong.  I had a blast and am looking forward to coming back for more beers. Will be giving the food menu a shot as well.  Drinks 1/27/2018",

    "text": "First and last time here. We sat waiting for a waitress for over 15-20 minutes, in between that time we walk over to the bar to see if we can order there but were told that we have to wait for a waitress. Cool! After another ten minutes of watching the waitresses laugh and play around the registers my fiance walked to them and ask would they send someone over to take our orders. As we're ordering the waitress has somewhat of an attitude but whatever. She wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all. She came back with our totals saying I need your card( threw me for a loop bc you normally pay after you received your food) payed her and she instantly comes back to pick up her tip. 30 minutes later our food finally arrives and the order is completely wrong. Partially the waitress fault for not understanding what we were asking for a combo sauce mix of hot and bbq and the other half was on the cooks. I tried to get her attention but the only person that would stop was the guy cleaning up glasses off the table. I asked for a manager but I wasn't approached by the manager instead approached by our waitress saying the managers were the cooks and no one was available At this time I informed her of the issues and asked for a refund. I loved the atmosphere but the service here is AWFUL! I would NOT be returning and I'll be waiting on my transaction to be reversed back to my card  Update: A week later I have not been refunded my money. So there is now a dispute being put in against these guys!",

Sat on the side with the two most horrible bartenders! Where do I start ... took forever to order a drink, mind you we were sitting right in front of them, made eye contact & neither of them cared or made an effort to acknowledge us. The vibe is great there & it's really loud, so I had to raise my voice to get their attention. Ordered a round of altas tequila, bartender rolled his eyes & we weren't even done ordering. He definitely didn't know how to pour because when one asked for tequila on the rocks, he filled a whole rocks glass of tequila hahahahahahah. Anyways we continued to stay there because we really wanted to try their beers. The service was just horrible, never checked up on us, no sense of urgency, they were too occupied messing with their handheld device. Mind you, their side of the bar wasn't even crazy busy. It got to the point where we felt uncomfortable to even ask for drinks. And I never heard of a (rude) barback who doesn't pour drinks. Maybe he got his job title mixed up as a busser instead. Anyways, When we did ask for another round one of the bartenders kept asking if we had a tab opened. Yes! We've been there for 2 hours & you still don't recognize us! Especially since we've been sitting there the whole time, gambling & never moved. They must've confused us as college kids like the rest of the crowd. I can probably run circles around these two bartenders; being in the industry. Mgmt, where did you find these two bartenders? Arkansas?",

And then when the girl came AFTER we flagged her down she was rude and like 'oh did you guys need drinks??' Like wtf? No we needed food! And she was unapologetic and really she was acting super odd. Drugs? Maybe. I don't know. I just bought a house down the street and was hoping this may be my neighborhood bar but by our bad experience here makes me think NOPE!!!

Even after my second visit was pretty bad, and i had a horrible time with slow service, i STILL left the 5 stars up because everyone has their nights... However, last night was horrible!!! Getting a server to do more than just walk by and look at us was hard. I had to get up and walk in from patio area and find a server. So michelle must have been having a bad night because her service was bad. She knows nothing about any of the 250 beers you guys have, nothing about whats popular to the regulars to eat or drink, and acted like we were bothering her to ask questions. So overall without writing a book on bad service i will just say michelle, and a few others there were just very rude. I have the cell ap that the waitress should log my beers on never was updated by here AFTER she took both my girls phone and mine to do so. So after 10 beers between us both wernt counted i figured id just remove the ap, and most likely just not go back. Its a cool place, but service standards are very bad.",

I stepped outside to the patio and our server sought me out there to let me know that they came so that they wouldn't be cold by the time I went back in. Big thumbs up for Chelsea? on that. She was very attentive to our group and we were never without a beer for more than five minutes. Great job guys!! Love the games and the heater outside too!

Let me start off by saying the concept they have was a cool idea with all the fun games you can play while sipping on some good brew. The place was packed because it really is a good spot to hang out with your friends. There were quite a few downfalls though. They have this huge menu with an awesome selection of microbrews that you can't get at any other bar, but their list needs to be updated. My friends tried ordering multiple beers that they somehow didn't have. Why are they even on the menu? That's just disappointing. One of my friends tried ordering five in a row that they just didn't have. That just looks all bad. I ordered a hot toddy with extra honey because I'm sick at the moment and it took a total of 20 minutes for it to show up. That's how long it should take for food to show up. On top of it, she handed me the mug with tea in it with the shot glass of whiskey on the side and lied to me and said she put some whiskey in the tea already but she brought me more on the side. The tea had no alcohol in it and no honey either. My friends drinks didn't arrive very quickly either and they ordered beer that simply needs to be poured in a glass. Talk about shitty customer service... I'm a server and I would never slack that hard or lie to my customers if I made a mistake like forgetting to put whiskey in a hot toddy. I would just make them a new one because I have this thing called common sense. The best thing I have to say about this place is that the atmosphere was cool and they had yummy house made chips. This place has potential but needs improvement in service and needs to have an accurate menu.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and had a great experience. Not tonight.  Got seated, a server walked by us about 6 times and complained about what a \"shit storm\" it was there to another server and constantly complained. She  finally came over  then decided to have a seat next to me...really. Started to complain about how busy she is.  Not one apology about making us wait. Told her to get up then she got an attitude for it, basically threw a temper tantrum.   We order and she kept walking by, talking to other servers and smirking,etc. An hour later still didn't get our food.  Went to leave and the waitress told us to have a good night with a smirk on her face. Then after telling her to fuck off so kindly the table she was at obviously already knew what happened and started yell at us and called my husband and asshole. Really,  this is how you treat people!?!  Well Mr. Fine, if you are ok with servers talking down about customers to other customers then I guess your ok with your patrons talking down about you and your family to others around Las Vegas.  So disappointed by this.  If your servers are that vindictive for us asking her to get up from our table I can imagine what they do when they get their feelings hurt.",

    "text": "After my initial visit, I returned several times to PKWY. On one occasion I made a reservation for a party of 8 in the patio on a Sunday evening and upon arrival the hostesses knew nothing about the reso. The drinks took FOREVER on this night as the outdoor bar was not open and our sever had 0 personality.   My most recent visit to PKWY definitely left a sour  taste in my mouth as we were denied entry into the venue. We had a group of about 20 people... Half the party were already inside and half were waiting for the rest of the party. There were 2 people in our party who took a swig from a bottle of liquor at their car and when we proceeded to walk to the entrance the security rudely shouted that he would not be allowing any of us into his bar because we were drinking in the parking lot. He then proceeded to mutter some other rude comments to our group. I understand rules are rules and perhaps he was just doing his job, however there was no reason for him to treat us or speak to us in the manner that he did especially since he is a representative of PKWY Tavern and therefore we are his customers/patrons. I thought it was also quite a bit racist of him to then ask every Asian person walking to the door if they were in our party... Wth.  Anyways we took our party of 20 to Born & Raised (BAR) on Warmsprings and Buffalo and had a fabulous night!   I would avoid PKWY on their \"busy nights\" as it seems like it is a complete $h*t show with security men going on power hungry tirades... Not to mention I probably ruined my tires having to drive over rocks in their overflow parking lot.",

    "text": "I'm so disappointed with last night. This is one of our favorite bars to go to for both drinking and eating. It's so fun, they have so many games like pool, bowling, jumbo jenga, and more! It's great for birthdays. They also have multiple bars in here. There's one out doors where there's sometimes live performances, and inside! It's in the perfect spot too. Right off Flamingo and 215. One of my favorite parts too is that there's a pokestop there too haha. If you don't like loud music, don't come here. .3  After a rough and tiring day at work (for both my boyfriend and I) we decided to come here for food and a beer. Most of the time, eating out is about 45 minutes anywhere we go. We got here at 11:50 and didn't leave til 1:20. After sitting, it took over 10 minutes to get a hi from our server. Another 5 for menus from a busser. She came by right after and took our drink orders It took about 5-10 to get our drinks. She took our food order right after. My boyfriend got a michelada and ask for it to be extra spicy. It wasn't spicy at all so he let it sit for 10 minutes before we were able to get someones attention. It took us 20 minutes after ordering to get our appetizer (we were about 40 minutes in at this point). 2 minutes after that to get plates and silverware. The meals came out about 10 minutes after which is just standard. After we ate, it took about 5 minutes to get the bill and 15 for her to swipe the card. By this point it wasn't busy anymore and I was annoyed again. We just wanted a decently quick meal and it was taking forever for even the check out process.   For the appetizer, we got the poutine tater tots. It had gravy and feta cheese. The gravy needed more salt, but it's nothing we can't do ourselves. The feta made the whole dish. I thought it was such an odd combination, but it worked out really well! I was craving nachos, but the stout stroganoff was calling my name. My man got the monte cristo. The stroganoff was soo worth that wait. The egg noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat was prime rib, it had amazing mushrooms, and had onions! The sauce was just amazing. Huge portion! The monte cristo was amazing as well. The jelly made it for me. It has swiss, ham, turkey, bacon, and jelly! It had a side of potatoes and they were very crispy and delicious.   It was busy, I understand. I'm not mad at the server Ashley. My boyfriend had her surprise him with what beer to put in the michelada and she put the most expensive beer which is a great way to hit sales marks and upsell. I blame management for not properly scheduling people. She was so over worked. One server, 1 or 2 bus men, and I think a manager (he was in a green shirt.) Really? They know this place is always busy. Coming from two people who have worked in restaurants for years, it's easier to over staff and cut some hours than to have one server take care of the whole inside area. Over staffing won't kill you. The company will make the money back the day after.",

Sat at a table both times and service took forever. By the time a server came to take our orders it still took some time to actually get our beers.  Then we ordered our food and another long wait.  By this time the crowd started coming in so we decided to go outside in the yard where there wasn't so many people.  Since the weather was still pretty chilly no one was out there so beers were a little easier to get at the bar.  Sure the games are fun and the place is super close to my house and they have a great beer list, but for the wait I don't think it's worth it.  The food is just ok too nothing I would go out of my way for.",

The inside is ginormous. Literally a huge tavern. There's inside seating, bars, and games (pool, bowling, etc.) and an small area outside with a bar and more games (corn hole, beer pong, etc.) The first time I came to PKWY I felt like I was in a frat house. Very young crowd - like being back in college. People say this place is similar to Gold Spike downtown because of the games but the outside area at GoldSpike is MUCH larger than at PKYWY.  I haven't tried the food here and the drinks are a little pricier than the average local spot. I went last Saturday and ordered 4 beers and 2 cocktails. My tab was around $50 averaging a little over $8/drink.  Justin was working at the bar and he was awesome! They were crazy busy but it didn't phase him and he made it seem like he was actually having fun. It really makes a difference when your bartender's pleasant every time you order a drink at a packed bar. The other times I've been to PKWY I've never had an issue with the service. Bartenders are pretty attentive to anyone who approaches the bar and it's not a difficult task to get another drink as it can be at other busy bars.   The ambiance and energy here is fun and I've enjoyed PKWY Tavern the few times I've been. Would I go every weekend? No, but I personally think they're doing a great job of attracting the type of clientele who will enjoy this spot regularly!",

    "text": "PKWY is just like Gold Spike, not as big and awesome but closer to home. They get so busy, you don't really get to enjoy a game since another party is waiting to use it next. They should definitely offer more outdoor seating since it gets awkward just standing around waiting for a table. The food is actually decent...can't go wrong with bar food while enjoying a few drinks! The service lacks big time, I always feel like I wait longer than usual for drinks, menus, to be served...everything. In fact, the lovely lady who helps out in the bathroom has way better customer service skills than most staff there.",

Positives: the fish and chips and the corn dog app the mustard is good though to swim in!!! #amazing, all the beers are cool, join the pkwy team and get the app it's 1000% worth it.   Negative: the mozzarella cheese app was blah at best and it was weird to find green peppers in the quesadilla, maybe it's just me.   Helpful note: Wait to make a reservation for anything until after u get all the welcome emails from signing up for the app! We signed up then 10 minutes later reserved and paid $140 ($100 minimum +$40 in fees) for a table that we could have gotten for no min, could have saved $40, i'm assuming. :(  All in all your paying for the awesome atmosphere and knowledge of your waiter/waitress.   **update** We went today for the hockey game and Ufc fight. I have to say I'm not a fan of the food. I got chicken and waffles and the chicken tasted like deep fried hockey pucks. You'll also find the \"chef\" or whom ever really likes their food spicy, which is a drag for someone who doesn't like everything that enters my mouth to be spicy. Lost a star since the food today and the other day wasn't great...I guess I'll stick to the corndogs!!",

    "text": "If it weren't for being the \"in\" place right now I probably wouldn't come here.  Parking is always a mess, the bartenders are sarcastic, rude, and not attentive what so ever, and it's always overcrowded.    Need I mention that when I was at the bar a girl next to me was closing out her tab and the bartender didn't even ask for the name just pulled out all of the credit cards he had and she said \"that one\".  It looked like mine because we both have southwest credit cards.  This was extremely worrisome as i had a tab open and if this is the way the bartenders handle credit cards, something needs to be reevaluated.  I'm a beverage manager and if my bartenders acted this way there would be a serious problem.    The drinks are reasonably priced and the crowd is always fun, that's the plus.    There are games so a lot of people would compare this to Gold Spike, I don't see it personally.  Also, the security staff is worthless.  My first night coming here there was someone that was beyond intoxicated, we were even thinking he was maybe on drugs because it was so bad, we notified security and they didn't do anything.  Finally they saw he was out of control and they did something and then an hour later he was back in the place.    If you haven't been i would check it out to make your own opinion, but I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "PKWY on Flamingo is a fantastic neighborhood tavern to hang out.  The vibe varies from the chill morning/day experience to the fun party scene at night.  The bartenders, servers, bussers, cooks, security staff and managers are all super friendly and attentive.  The beer club and patio games have been an awesome way to get to meet so many new friends - every time we come in we see friendly faces.  You can pretty much see any game you want on their tv's.  All this makes it the best bar on the west side. Luckily for the rest of the Valley there's another PKWY Tavern at Tivoli Village and on Marks Street in Henderson. Both of those locations have awesome staff as well. If you haven't been, you're missing out!! If you come in and see me come say hi.",

I guess since the last time I was there before this past weekend was probably my high school reunion in June (which if you need to plan an event, highly recommend them! They were awesome to work with and gave us SO much space exclusively!).  This location is a bit far for us, but up until a couple years ago (pre-friends having babies and getting weird work schedules), my friend and I frequented this location almost every weekend. After 10 p.m., it definitely turns into a party with a loud DJ, hipster-cool kid vibes, etc. We happened to come for their pre-Life is Beautiful event this past weekend. They had a block party vibe going on, which was pretty cool. There was a ball pit, some cool light up things you could sit on (though they kind of looked like they could also tip over at any given point given some drunken shenanigans), and even a waterslide, which I don't think was super popular, seeing as how the venue is a bar, not a waterpark LOL.  All in all, we definitely have enjoyed some really great times and amazing memories. One of my best friend's even met her fiance here a few years ago, so you just never know! This place has a special place in my heart, too, just because it's really a fun place to drink and hang out with friends. Highly recommend, especially if you're in your twenties or thirties!",

And I like to use water to pour into my beer pong cups, because when the ball rolls on the floor; the floor is dirty. Not saying that it doesn't get cleaned. Just saying you don't know where people shoes has been, even if there's a cleaning cup for the balls, the water is already nasty from cleaning it multiple time. So idk maybe it's just me.  I do not recommend their drink of the month watermelon cocktail drink. I didn't like it. Lily our server lady she was very nice! :)",

No one was there & no signage. Nice outdoor patio at least but its 113 degrees water mist wouldnt even be comfortable in this heat! We then continued to \"wait\" with no server for awhile which is always frustrating. People walked by but no one came to tell us they were our server. Finally someone came over but she was unfortunately frazzled the entire time so it was stressful for us the patrons as well. The manager said they were trying to help her out but i mean it was dead inside so...maybe thats just not your calling if you cant handle three tables. You arent in the weeds.  Got our food-jalapeno popper egg rolls, decent tasting but not w the jelly. Maybe ranch or something else. We never got any refills bc our waitress was non existent so the host came and did it for us which was appreciated. I got chicken fingers and tater tots. I asked if the chicken for the sliders was frozen or fresh she didnt seem to know she said they come frozen so...I wish staff was educated regarding all facets of the food so they know the answers. No buffalo sauce had to ask again for that then my guest asked for extra sliced pickled on his burger and it came w one pickle spear snd then was told \"oh we dont even have those pickles\" wait  so you let him order extra of something you dont even HAVE? Come on every little thing just added up and it just wasnt an overall pleasant experience. I wanted to like it bc the interior looks like it could be a fun place to go to-large tvs, and games etc.",

They had nine sours listed and none were available. It was a 5-10 minute wait for the happy ill-trained server to make that determination. We started out with four people at our table. When four more showed up the server was not happy - \"Four more, HUFF\". She didn't have a clue about beer and had no alternatives when our first choices were out. Third strike for us and this place. Keep giving them a try based on their False advertising of the numbers of beers they have on tap. We were there on 8/31 and the massively inaccurate beer list was dated 7/25. Paper is cheap how about a bit more timely list. It will save your untrained staff that trip to the bar for inventory updates",

It was a very vibrant and fun atmosphere.  If you weren't singing you could also play with giant jenga blocks.  We ordered some appetizers that were pretty good. The bbq chicken wings were SO spicy so it was hard to eat but they were tasty. The jalapeno egg roll poppers weren't spicy - more cheesy - but they were okay. We also ordered the elephant ear which is fried bread that can be dipped in chocolate or Caramel. Tasted like something you would get at a fair, so pretty good!",

    "text": "Finally made it out to the infamous PKWY tavern..  I came on a weeknight and it was surprisingly somewhat busy. PKWY seems more like a sports bar combined with a bar/club scene (more so on the weekends.) I'd say there were about 20-30 other people, mainly in the bar area. I'm sure on the weekends it gets much more packed. They have a variety of card/board games, bowling, pool, and some other games outside that I didn't get to see since it was raining.   DRINKS: If you enjoy various types of craft beer then PKWY should be right up your alley. The menu was packed with different IPAs, ciders, stouts, etc. There were some unique variations (Mango, strawberry, marshmallow??) as well as a few local breweries.   FOOD: I got an order of their fried pickles and these are different than the ones I've had before. I was expecting sliced pickles but they give you long, quartered pickles instead. I actually like this a lot better! The batter is more of a tempura batter, light and crispy. 9/10 recommend trying.   SERVICE: I was expecting the lackluster service you get at crowded bars but all of our servers were extra attentive. They checked up on us almost every 10 minutes, refilling our waters and drinks. Maybe it's because I came on a slower night but our servers had no trouble being efficient and quick.   TIP: They have various events throughout the month so be sure to check out their calendar. There's a Stoplight Valentines party, Ladies Night on Thursday's... oh and all the events have cheap drink specials too!   Another cool thing I noticed was their electric car charging ports! So if you wanna swing by in your Tesla then you can charge while you grab a beer haha.  All in all this place seems like a step up above your average pub. I'll be back on a weekend to see what it's like then.",

I'm pretty sure we swore this place off two years ago after going there for food and the subsequent trip(s) to the bathroom. Silly on our part to forget this level of awfulness.   Do not order the Philly Cheesesteak. 'Meat' is weird and cheese probably is of the \"just add water\" verity. They could take this sandwich off the menu and that alone would bump my review up to 2 stars.",

Also the beer club they have is awesome. Get to try a ton of new beers and earn some cool prizes while doing so. As for the food, it's a dialed up bar menu in which they nail. Definitely recommend stopping by here instead of another PTs/Putter's.",

    "text": "We used to go to this place when it was Roadrunner saloon so we thought we would try out the new place. First thing that hits you when you walk in is the college type atmosphere. The entire patio is Astroturf where you can play games or beer pong while you drink. Although that isn't really my kind of scene I was willing to give the food a try since the menu looked decent. The menu is pretty basic, burgers, wraps, salads etc. Although if you want a steak salad be ready to fork over $18! We ordered fried pickles, the big Texan burger and chipotle chicken sliders. First the negatives...the pickles were burnt, the burger way too salty and both the onions and jalapenos on it were fried so there was no variety of texture, the chicken sliders were dry and not seasoned very well. The positives... The waitress was great and they have 250 different kinds of beer. Bottom line if you're looking for somewhere to drink with a good variety of beer and you like the college vibe you will probably like this place. If you are looking for a good meal...you should probably keep looking.",

BUT, I definitely recommend coming before late night.  WHY? The night have been over run by drunkin' sloppy college kids. It's unfortunate that this is their clientele now late night. Not bashing on business but it kinda sucks you can't have a nice dinner and drinks in a fun bar environment when there is practically a college frat party going on in the background.  Unfortunately this led to my experience of having poor service. I was sitting at a table watching 3-4 servers walk by just looking at me. After 10 minutes one finally approached and said \"do you want a menu?\" I would assume sitting in a booth means such but I can get that a lot of these cheap kids just sit in these booths just to sit.  In the end, great bar to definitely check out but avoid the nightlife if your looking for a bit more bar like atmosphere. I hope this place doesn't get shut down for its high probability of underage college drinking! It's too good!",

Didn't know a bar could get shut down for that. In that case, they should close down almost all the bars around Vegas. Lol I tried to ask nicely at first and said that it was my birthday and half of my group were already inside waiting. Asshole just brushed me off and my group. But also failed to recognize 2 of my friends that were actually drinking and let them back in again. Asked for proof and he said he doesn't need proof identifying the guilty ones sounding like a real bar nazi. So I informed the rest of my group and moved to Born and Raised. Thanks for ruining my night Parkway Tavern, damn you!!! As for this asshole, time to take that stick out of your ass because you're obviously miserable. Or get a job that actually makes you happy. Not one where you just get power happy because you can and ruin everyone else's fun. Thanks! Never going back to this place again and I do hope your customers get caught drinking in the parking lot by one of your undercovers and get shut the F down. Lol Bye !!!!",

Can't even comment on the menu since we never got to look at one.  Completely disappointing. We live in the neighborhood and are always eager to try new restaurants/bars that open up. If this is the norm at pkwy, I don't expect the doors to be open long.",

    "text": "I decided to come here simply because of the hype, I've heard nothing but good things about this place so I obviously had high expectations. I wish I had no expectations because it's not everything I imagined. For starters, there's a patio in the front with picnic tables where picnic type games can be played, it's got a downtown/Goldspike feel to it, which if I were to go anywhere for that, I would prefer downtown. Inside though, there is a small bowling lane (2 lanes I think!) and a couple pool tables which is nice for the large amount of crowds they bring in..now speaking of the crowds, this place looks like it's for a young crowd but there was a very diverse group when I went. When we went to grab a seat at the bar, it looked like the only seats available were gaming chairs so we grabbed a booth instead. Now I know all bars aren't stocked with supplies for specialty drinks but they just had a plain old regular bar so I got a Moscow Mule with Goose in it and ordered some food. Now for the food, I give 4.5 stars, no complaints but definitely not 5 star worthy. The drinks, I give a 2, and for the lack of better options, and next time I'll definitely go with beer! They have little beer dispensers you can purchase for your table which would be awesome especially for large groups of people. I wouldn't ever voluntarily come here again, but I wouldn't mind coming to grab a quick beer.",

Thy were on the ball with drink orders and food orders as well. The bartenders were attentive when I was only up there having a smoke. We went outside to play games and an ID is required to get the equipment needed. No problem. About an hour later, more and more people started coming in all looking to play the games and such. I felt stalked by vultures. Food was good, beer selection is good and ask them about their super bowl shindig, sounds like a great deal!! Too bad I have plans already! I'll definitely be back.",

Some women walked up and said if we weren't playing we had to move. There were no signs on the machines. I wish that I could say driving here from Henderson was worth it. However when you have to move when you shouldn't, it's quite inappropriate. How unfortunate this is for a place that has so much potential. I understand this place is not a bounce club, but favoritism was shown from bartenders. Service began to suck... No wonder this place has HORRIBLE reviews.",

We made reservations last week because it was going to be a party of 14 at 6:30. When we arrived, they had no where to put us, the manager \"forgot\" to look at the reservation list. Then they wanted to put picnic tables together and sit us outside in 105 degree weather. This place is a joke and only reason it gets busy is because of the young college crowd that visits. The staff is clueless! We ended up leaving after they wouldn't do anything for us and went down the road to Lindo and had a wonderful time.",

They also have cool events they invite you too. The place has a great vibe overall. The outdoor patio has a lot to offer with different games and seating areas.

During the winter they do have a few heaters outside. They offer a few games to play such as giant Jenga, corn hole, mini bowling, pool, and even board games. There's lots of tv's mainly inside and some outside too, which is great for watching sports and they even play UFC and other fights too! The parking lot is kind of small compared to the huge crowd this place brings so expect to park on the dirt most of the times. Huge beer selection! And their food is ur basic American cuisine such as burgers, wings, sandwiches, etc. I tried the Cheesy Potato Skins, they were actually really good that we ordered and second plate lol. The only thing i would change from this place is for them to have more appetizer options. Just because a lot of people come here mainly to drink and not so much for a full meal, so just kind of wished they had more shareable options or small playes.",

We ordered chicken fingers and a Breakfast sandwich which looked good - but was really was sub -par. The Chicken fingers were over cooked and so were their kettle chips. They were so thin - they had no taste even with the cheese sprinkled all over them. The Egg sandwich had the egg over cooked even when I asked for over easy and was served on a wood plank. It was cute but made eating the sandwich more difficult than a plate (I would have never imagined) as it was small and hard to manage my sandwich on. The prices are good - but the food and service  was subpar.",

I was constantly having to flag down the waitresses just trying to get them to acknowledge me at all. They walked by our table all the time, but never stopped. And when we did get to finally order, it would be another eon of waiting before we got our beers. I've even heard of friends telling me that they went in on a night where they were showing a UFC fight. After being seated, they were told that they might go the entire night without getting served. Right away they actually told them that!  PKWY Tavern also boasts over 250 beers, but both times I was there, my friends and I had to keep changing our orders because they were out of a lot of the beers they have.

I would have left five stars except for the fact that they need to work on their waitresses / customer service. As soon as this waitress walked up there was no introduction it was \" what can I get you?\" We ordered some appetizers and drinks... The onion rings were so good that we ordered an extra side... At that point she made the face as if we were some blobs ordering excessively. No more than five minutes later they knew set of guests sat next to us. At that point she did what I have never seen. Instead of going and getting them of fresh set of menus see straight looked over at us took our menus and gave them to the guest. Keep in mind we haven't even ordered yet. We gave her a face like what the hell just happened. Noticing us she looked at us as if we were unreasonable replied \"I'll get you new menus\". So we finally ordered and waited patiently... After about 15 minutes I got my hamburger but still have not gotten my wife's  fish and chips. Thinking it would be out within the next 5 minutes we waited... Finally we decided to ask her what's going on with the rest of the meal and she gave me the oh crap look and replied with \" let me check on those for you\" (crap I forgot. .let me put them in). Another 15 minutes later we get the rest of our meal. We needed a little salt and I was regretting having to ask her... When I finally did there was another weird face as if we were asking way too much. Long story short this waitress needs a serious retraining or a pep talk to brighten up her day. Restaurant and atmosphere was superb. I don't want to say any names ** cough Kara cough**.",

They are by far the best bar food choice on the menu. The best nights to go are Wednesday's, Friday's, and Saturdays. It can get crowded but not matter what it is a good time. UFC nights are also very busy but they show them for free so what do you expect. They need to pave the parking lot and the inside could use some disinfecting.

Got there at 6:10pm, ordered food at 6:30, 7:20 rolls around and I finally tell our waitress we are starving, she says \"do you want to order food?\"  Seriously? We ordered food 50 minutes ago!!! This place is a joke & the menu actually sucks as far as decent bar food goes. They have busboys running around with food and they have no idea where it's going. The wait staff is not on top of anything. To top things off we had to sit on the patio and it was really cold out. Do you think they could turn the heaters on? Nope!! WILL NOT BE BACK!!!",

My first few visits weren't terrible, but not fantastic either.  The food was average, but edible.  The staff seemed to have an arrogance about them that was slightly irritating, but tolerable.  I went for lunch about a month ago and had a good experience.  Food was good, and service great.    Since then, it has been horrible.  The day after my lunch there, I went for dinner.  I had the worst burger I can remember.  It was so badly overcooked, it was like a hockey puck, even though I ordered it medium rare.  The pork belly was also way overcooked.  At least the service was decent.  My next visit, the food was decent, but the service was so bad, my friends and I now have this to compare all bad service with.  She set the new low standard!  After a couple weeks away, I returned.  I figured that I would just avoid sitting in that terrible server's section.  I sat in a set in being served by someone new to me.  Wow, she must be friends with the other one.  Bad service twins!  Actually, to be fair, she wasn't as bad as the other one, but she was bad enough for inspire me to write this review.  These incidents are enough to show that they have a management problem.  One bad apple is one too many.  When there are multiple, that is enough to bankrupt a business. As a manager in the customer service industry, it is obvious to me that they have a culture that is poisonous.  While they probably feel that they are busy and don't need all the business they can get, they are seriously wrong.  It doesn't take much for the tide to shift.    Just check the Yelp ratings.  Three stars with a few hundred reviews is something to be embarrassed about.  All of those customers can't be wrong.",

    "text": "PKWY Tavern is a fun Vegas locals bar with an impressive list of beer (over 250 named), decent bar food, and dozens of inside and outside games laid out to get you fraternizing with others.  We Uber'd here with a large group of friends this past Saturday night. They were surprised how cheap the drink prices were and had fun perusing the beer list while trying their best to win at everything.   We were able to play mini bowling on PKWY's two lanes with 7 people. Super fun, but at $3 per round per person I may not call for a rematch, but still I'd say it's worth it for atleast one go. After a few more drinks I may not have cared.   PKWY Tavern has created a pretty interactive phone app where you can log in, track how many drinks you've ordered against their local leaderboard, get prizes for using the app and tallying drinks ordered, and follow which beers you've tried and recommendations of others to try in the future. You get a free shirt just for downloading the app and scanning in with your server.   They seemed to have perfected the socialization of the bar, but my only recommendation is to clean their outside tables and games more regularly. Though he may have been joking, I had a friend turn down an offer to play giant Jenga for fear of transmittable disease. Albeit it was sticky from prior players.   With that being said, this is the best late night bar around for 20 somethings to 30 somethings.",

You can't even buy the table, they said all tables were reserved from the previous game. We asked the waiterss  if she can find us somewhere to sit, and for the time being we sat down at a dirty table just to see if she can find us a table, the waitress said  let me check with the manager, a security guy walked up to us and looked like he is ready to punch someone, and asked us to leave the table,  I replied that she is checking with the manager if she can find us a table. His reply  \"I'm the manager and you gotta leave\" so yeah we left.  Decided to check another bar, end up going down the road to SG bar and they sat us right away, the manager Dan at SG was very nice and actually looked like a manager that cares about the business and not like someone trying to pick up a fight.  #GOKNIGHTSGO",

So this place took a bit of Gold Spike and they have over sized Jenga, Pool, a deer hunting game, Mini Bowling -- you read that correctly ..... and a ping pong table.  The beer selection is too crazy to type out here.  A lot of craft beers and a lot of options for food.  Speaking of food I had some sliders and fries and it was actually pretty good.  This place is pretty big but it needs to be because its always crowded.    There is a UNLV Running Rebels section which I thought was pretty awesome.  There is also a nice courtyard area thats on your right when you first walk in.  It was winter time while I was out there but I bet its super cool (Like a biergarten) in the spring and summer.  Theres a little mini bar outside.  BTW The bartender that hooked it up with the ping pong balls thank you for being cool as f***.  This place is super fun.... My only complaint is they need to knock a wall down because its too small for the crowd they get.  This place is big so you can imagine how many peeps are there.  I want to say there is at least 100-150 people there around 2100-TBD.  Even if you aren't a local I recommend this place to get away from the strip and see an awesome sports bar!  Bangkok, like Las Vegas, sounds like a place where you make bad decisions. - Todd Phillips",

We were seated fast and ordered drinks. It wasn't that busy but took a long time to get. The menu was reasonable and decided on steak and eggs. The food was delivered faster because they have a food runner, not the slower waitress/cocktail server. I ordered rare and my wife medium. When the food arrived they were both medium rare, I guess that's all they could manage that day. I was looking forward to trying the breakfast potatoes but  was sadly disappointed. They were cold and tasted like they had been sitting awhile.  After the waitress finally came back to the table and asked if we wanted anything more while clearing the table, we said no. We sat for more than a reasonable amount of time had to ask another server for the check. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day and may try again for lunch or dinner another time, but not promising.",

There were definitely some hiccups with the service our party received after the game had finished. The servers here are extremely overwhelmed. Members of our party had ordered appetizers...only half of them were delivered to the table. Drinks were mixed incorrectly, and one of my friends (who was the first to order anything in our group) did not receive her food order or her drink for almost an hour. Also, finding a manager for a medical or teacher discount is like asking the bartenders to move mountains. Would definitely eat something at home before coming here on a Friday night!",

We waited a good amount of time and our \"server\" never arrived. We asked someone cleaning a table if we could get someone. After some time, no one ever came to our table.   I saw TWO servers walk in and out of the kitchen multiple times (they didn't have food or trays either times). I can understand if the restaurant/bar portion was packed or super busy and having to wait a significant amount of time. Sadly, no one ever came to our table. This was the first time that I have ever walked out of an establishment (we didn't even have water). We left our menus on the hostess table and ate another restaurant.   I asked my friend this morning if she has ever had lunch here and she said \"yes, but the service is really bad\" and I didn't even tell her about what had happened yet. I gave this place two stars, because the food I have had there is actually very good. However, the service is something that needs to be worked on.   I don't think I will be returning to this establishment, until the service is improved.",

Food was good and the atmosphere  was amazing. I highly recommend you try the new Pkwy Tavern in Tivoli Village. I'm a new repeat customer. I'll be there at least once a week for Football and great food.",

I could see this place as a big hangout during football season, for the food is mostly bar type food and indoor and outdoor seating can handle big groups, but we won't be returning anytime soon.  There are two pool tables, bowling, a large connect four, wooden jenga, and ping pong to keep you busy, and plenty of parking.  We ordered the chicken strips and pulled pork sandwich.  The chicken strips were really good, but the onion rings were fried with a weak batter and did not taste good. The cole slaw had that plastic taste like it was poured from a container, not fresh.  The pulled pork sandwich was tasty, or at least the sauce was, but the meat was dry.  We also ordered jalapeno poppers, which I really love, but these were Velveeta cheese placed in a dough cone, and jalapeno so small I beg to find the jalapeno.  You weren't biting into a jalapeno at all, just cheese siphoned into a dough wrap.  Some really cool drink specials are advertised for happy hour which I see as big hits, but we won't be returning for lunch or dinner anytime soon.",

I asked if it could open and since I had 20 people there they gladly turned on the heaters and set it up for us to be outside. It was as if we had our own party there just for us!!! It was so much fun. Large connect four, JENGA, beer pong. So many fun things to do! The staff was great and the SHRIMP IS SOOOO GOOD!!! The variety of beers is amazing. Wells banana nut bread beer is my absolute favorite and I've never had it on tap! I highly recommend this place and I WILL be back for future events!

Tell me why i get kicked out by this bouncer (the one thats a white guy, bold and with earings). So i just got out of my car and about to throw away this beer can that i had in my car and he said i cant drink out here and the beer was empty! And i was throwing it away! I said im sorry to the bouncer and didnt know i couldnt just throw away a empty can! The bouncer said i cant come any more or ever be here. For a fucking empty can! Lmao smh! (on top of everything i was going there to meet my sister to celebrate her 23rd birthday and this stupid bouncer ruins everything!!!) So i try again and talk to the bouncer, while im talking to him i see other people walking outside drinking their alcohol! And ofcourse the damn bouncer let them go back in! (either that bouncer is racist or just being a dick! To me for no damn reason!) i swear this bouncer needs to be fired! Because his customer service is poor and he is pointing his damn finger just at me! I dont ever want to go there ever again just for that experience!  Dont recommend this place to anyone because u will get kicked out for the dumbest reason! I even asked the bouncer for his name and of course his unprofessional ass wouldnt give me his name or even let me talk to the person who ran the place because i knew he would of gotten fired for what he told me! And not let me in. If any of ya decide to go to that place watch out for that certain bouncer!",

It took better than 20 minutes to get the beer we ordered, even though we were assured it was on it's way out about 5 minutes after it was ordered. The second beer we ordered was even worse with the wait time. We order, she leaves, presumably to put the order in, then comes back to tell us the beers are \"on the way out,\" then COMES BACK to the table to tell us that one of the beers ordered is no longer offered... So what was on the way out?!  The food was... okay at best. It wasn't horrible at all, but it wasn't anything to go crazy over either. While we were there (on a Saturday afternoon), we saw at least 2 parties come in, seat themselves, then leave because nobody came over to wait on them.  The place itself seems like it could be a really cool spot to hang out. Lots of TVs, some pool tables, some crazy bowling alley thing, and the patio all looked like a good time, but something has got to be done about the speed of service there. I could overlook the mediocre food if everything else is in line.  All in all, I may go back, just not anytime soon.",

First off, let me say that our waitress was awesome. She seemed to be single handedly serving the outside seating area and was doing the best she could to service everyone. I think the problem lays with management. It appears that the establishment is severely understaffed; hire some more wait staff so that customers don't have to wait 20 minutes to be served and then have to be apologized to multiple times for the quality of service.   When our food finally came out, one person in our group ordered quesadillas with NO sour cream and a side of tater tots. His quesadilla was loaded with sour cream and and there were no tots to be seen. After sending the quesadilla back to be corrected he asked about his tots, the kitchen wait staff that was running he food out brought back a cup of salsa. After being told again that we were missing tater tots, then kitchen staff returned a second time with a cup of tarter sauce. Finally, after physically showing him the menu, tater tots were finally brought to the table.   Upper level management, based on our experience and the experience of other Yelp reviews, fix your problems. As for our waitress, AnneMari, was awesome. She's overworked. Give her a raise.",

There is a sea of young Americans all hanging out after work or hustling the streets slanging their model head shots or club promoters or maybe even bros preaching about their Greek life playing pool, skee ball, darts ping pong, beer pong, or perhaps corn hole. Look at the bar and you might find your local wanna be cicerone drinking their nitro IPA. Outside you'll see games, and an hang out area to get bro out or get white girl wasted.  On the back wall you'll see a beer list of 250 something beers, not all in stock of course (its really impossible to have such a large inventory and low prices). What they do have in stock are a mixture of local microbrews and bigger names like Firestone, Dogfish, Lindeman's or Lagunitas (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pkwytavern.com%2Fbeer.php%23mix&s=72e22cf3c24938e0821c10b0e69b12044f7bad225608541c5b7d10a723cf5d7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pkwytavern.com/beer.php#...</a>) and macrobrews (coors, blue moon, etc). Most of them are on draft so that is always cool! Probably not the place to look for an ultra rare beer. Prices for beers are \"OK\" more so on the pricey end, but someone has to pay to have this big inventory. Draft beers are either half pint or pint and average prices are $6-$10 depending on the beer. Will be a bit costly to get a decent buzz on.Food seems above average for bar food and breakfast is served all day. Although its always pretty packed here, there always seems to be space for table diners.   I like that they have metal darts and not the cheap plastic kind, games are inexpensive, the bartenders work really hard and the wait for service hasn't been too bad for me. Parking sucks here because its packed all the time, so be prepared to park in the desert.   Will come back when me or my friends are feeling ratchet.",

This easily grew to be a hangout spot for local college kids, especially on the weekends. A lot like Gold Spike, they have games such as cornhole, Jenga, and board games you can get for rent with an ID. I personally like their large selection of beers and that's what I like to drink when coming here. One annoying thing for me is that it can get packed on the weekends with college kids everywhere, and it can be a little too much. Other than that, itMs definitely a nice place to get some beers , catch up with some friends, and get some finger food to pass the time.",

    "text": "I was debating not sharing my thoughts, but then I read several reviews with similar issues, so I figured I may as well do so as well.  My wife and I went in to PKWY on a UFC event, so it was understandably busy.  We walked by an empty host booth, and then walked into the main bar area.  We asked a busser if we were to seat ourselves, and his reply was \"Sure, but it's fight night. You may, or may not get help.\"  Anyhow, we sat down, and a waitress by the name of Destiny came over and assisted us. To get it out of the way, Destiny was fantastic and salvaged the experience for us.  The first few beers we ordered were out of stock, but we still picked some good, but pricy, local beers.  My wife ordered a Caesar salad, and I ordered the chicken wings.  The food was down right horrid.  The wings were either cold or lukewarm, and the salad was room temperature with wilted lettuce, as if it had been sitting out all day.  To be fair, it was a busy night, but when you add up terrible food, overpriced beer (a local IPA shouldn't cost $7.50 a pint), and very suspect service, you get a bar that I don't see myself going back to.  Again, I will commend the waitress that ended up helping us out, because she tried hard to ensure that we were having a good experience.   I hope she finds herself at an establishment that matches her level of care and concern.",

And i over heard them conplaining that their is too many people just playin games and not buying drinks. What is that all about? I'm glad they remodeled it here. But they need to change the staff. They slow. And the bartenders have a smart mouth. Only plus side is to this place is that cute girls come here. That's it. I'll stop coming here if they ever start charging at the door.

We waited a long time for someone to come to the hostess desk to which did not happen.  We saw 3 bus guys that ignored us and one waitress who was talking with a table like 5min.  Once she came to greet us with a snotty attitude from 15feet away stated \"you can just seat yourselves\".  I pointed out to her, no where does it say or state please seat yourself.  I asked for a manager and the GM Danny came out & I proceeded to tell him what had happened he stated \"well I left the floor for just a few minutes\".  BEWARE........customer service is not a high priority for this management staff on down to their SNOTTY wait staff.  It was better when his place was ROADRUNNER!",

I want to say that this business should have a 5 star rating but one worker ruined it for us tonight for my girlfriends birthday. Being someone who manages a restaurant business i noticed a certain employee that is capable of ruining their business . I will not mention names but I think I think they should look in how they train food runners.  I ordered food and drinks from the bartender tonight and when the food was dropped off I asked for two waters and was given a dirty look and he said \"sure.\" I didn't think any of it and was waiting for my water then I see him at the podium looking at the customers and he obviously ignored our request for water. so I confront him and ask him what happened to the waters I asked for since we are eating and he says \"that is not my job, that is the bartenders job\" so I ended up going to the bar to get water . maybe I misunderstood or didn't realize that he doesn't normally get customers requests but he didn't give a care in the world. Even though it's not his job or if he hates his job isn't it common courtesy to tell us he can't give us water instead of ignoring our request ? I think this place needs to train their staff better or look into who they hire.",

    "text": "This place is super casual and fun. It's a great place to watch sports (Go knights) but if you are going to a big game, make sure to reserve a table. It's standing room only if you don't. The bartenders are good, prices reasonable and they have a lot of games to play. I like going here because it's a good crowd usually full of locals.  The only negatives about this place come from the service. I have had multiple occasions here where I wait upwards of 30 minutes to an hour waiting on my check or for my card to be ran. Also, if you're there for a game, expect for your server to disappear for hours at a time. Luckily the hostesses are nice enough to help you when your waitress is no where to be found. We waited about an hour for our check and 20 minutes for our cards to be ran, our server checked on us twice during a 2 hour game, and though friendly, she not once apologized. As we had our cards ran, other people were trying to interrupt her since they were waiting forever too. I have worked in and respect the food industry so I understand completely how busy bars can get. But if understaffed, you should have more hands on deck during busy games. Also, they are constantly out of things on the food menu, and often serve their food differently than they explain on the menu. We once ordered fried pickles and they served ours with like some weird chunky sauce and our friends with ranch.  Then I ordered something that was supposed to come with honey mustard and it was just plain mustard. Lol. I even asked the server and she didn't know the difference. It's fine I still like this place, just hope they step up their service before I have to find somewhere else to go.",

    "text": "I am the leader of an alumni chapter here in town, and we have had the majority of our game watch events at this PKWY location. Being an east coast school, it was a little challenging to find a family friendly sports bar that is open for those 9 am (local time) games. Side note: do you know how weird it is to drink beer at 9 am when you are in your thirties? Thank you Bloody Marys!  The UNLV room is great for hosting small events, with comfortable seating for around 24 people. They can turn the sound on to your game, and have some shutters they can close when your team intercepts the ball, and runs 75 yards for a touch down, and things get a little \"passionate.\"   Ann Marie has been our main server for many of these events and she with it!! Having that many separate checks can be challenging, but so far we haven't had any problems. I wish I knew the bus boy's name to recognize him, because he such a hard worker too. If you are looking to plan an event I would definitely recommend this place, the manager is very easy to work with!   I realize since all but one of my visits here was to organized events, that my experience might vary from someone just coming in to get a table (service-wise.) Food however, is the common denominator:  The Barcuterie app is really fun- who doesn't love a giant pretzel with cheese sauce and grainy mustard? Anything with their pulled pork is also really good. The biggest surprise on the menu for me, was their salmon salad. The salmon was cooked very well, and the greens were nice and fresh - the first time I ordered it, others at the table saw mine and ordered also. If you are a veggie burger fan, they make their own patties - no frozen Morningstar farms burgers here.   No matter what you order - get a side of their tots!",

There were people eating. As you continue to the back of the bar there is another bar with so many beers on tap it will make your head spin. I am unfortunatly not a beer drinker. And to the right of the bar there is a small bowling alley! I never played in there but it looked like a lot of fun.  The food is pretty alight. Its regular bar food you usually find. I had the taste of the wings, fries, onion rings. It was pretty good.  The bartenders were pretty fast and do their best to not ignore anyone when your at the bar even though this place gets REALLY packed during a weekend. Even on a Thursday night it was really full.

I'm a fan obviously because they have hundreds of different beers. And the fact that it has a Gold Spike vibe but in a more laid back smaller neighborhood sports bar atmosphere plus its on my side of town.  They have lots of ways to entertain yourself lots of TVs to watch a game, board games, darts, billiards, they're own bowlingo alley, and lots of people of all ages, mostly the 20s and 30s crowd. It starts getting packed later in the night like between 9 and 11. Indoor area, outdoor patio, and a rebel area, lots of places to sit or hang as long as you can find on open spot.  Sign up for their rewards program basically you get rewarded the more different beers you drink. The only bad thing about it is that they don't add your drink to your account as you order them. They do it at the end when you're paying the bill and you have grab one of the employees up in the front. They dont keep track of what you ordered, like no itemized receipt, and you're just guessing it. Doing this to how many customers a night just doesnt make sense. Pretty much skipped get rewarded the last 2 times there. Its a cool reward program, if you get your beers added to your account.  Foods your typical bar food. Tried the potato skips it was pretty over cooked, felt almost like eating some thick chips. Also tried some of the wings, not bad but not great.  Not a fan of the food I've tried, so far, but a fan of everything else about PKWY Tavern, except they way they add your beers to the reward program. I'll be back.  Oh yea when its busy you'll be stuck parking in the unpaved dirt area.",

The Big Cheese(12.95$) is by far the best sandwich ever made in this world. Period. It comes with a side of super creamy tomato soup that I dip my sandwich in!   WTF fries (9.95$) couldn't get any better. A fried egg and guac and cheese and jalapenos and BACON?! All on top of deliciously fried fries? For this price the portion is more than enough for one person!   The beers here are good, you definitely need to come a few times to try a bunch or else you're not getting the full experience. The bartenders are awesome and they are fast!   Definitely a place to come to eat and drink and play some games! They have bowling, darts, pool, beer pong, life-size Jenga, and that one game where you throw a bag into a hole??   Lots of options here, I promise you will NEVER get bored!",

Ordered Mac and cheese, potato skins, salad and egg breakfast. We got our food all at the same time, with no silverware. Tried to track down a server. Finally got up and walked around to find silverware. Dug into the food and it was nasty. The salad was completely overdressed, the eggs looked like they were from McDonalds and the Mac and cheese was salty and just gross. We had ordered drinks and my husband got a shot, which he got after we were done as they never brought it out.   I really wanted to like this place. The patio seemed pretty cool with jenga on it and tvs. I haven't played jenga in forever and asked the server how to play and she kinda laughed at me. I would never go back here again. NEVER",

I believe the security guards are constantly on a high horse & arrogant... and I hate to say it, but the constant reviews regarding racism are True. I've experienced them first hand (whether they don't want to let you in, give my friends a hard time, or witnessing other groups harassed -- for no reason) and it's a shame, because that sets the tone of the place since it's the first part you have to deal with. And just like everyone else mentions, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Truly.  The plus sides? This place has a nice, chill ambiance... often described as a \"mini Gold Spike,\" has the laid back atmosphere with a lot of games like corn hole, beer pong, darts, billiards, bowling, giant Jenga, etc. Located on 215 & Flamingo so it's away from the downtown chaos and usually has a good amount of people there. The drinks are cheap, food very reasonably priced... Not a place I would choose personally; If it weren't for my friends picking it due to it being close by, I would never go out of my way.",

    "text": "Damn, this place is great. Great food & beer, incredibly friendly staff, and lots of entertainment. It's the perfect place, away from the strip, to hang out for a beer or have a huge party with all your friends.   I discovered this PKWY while looking for a place to watch the UFC event - at the door it was $20, or No Cover if you're a member. When I heard \"member\" I thought, \"WTF is that for?\"  Not to worry friends, it is simply a sign-up to their mobile app, and it's free (more about this app later).   Once inside, it's awesome: outdoor backyard-style area with picnic tables and overhead string lighting; then the middle section that's kinda outdoorsy with garage style lift gates; and the inside, a huge bar of countless taps with several TV's and bar games on the side. There's even a private area that can be sectioned off.   We sat in the middle section of it all and had great views of the fight in every direction. There's even our own TV at our table, with a power outlet with USB underneath to charge your phone. Neat.   There's plenty of food on the menu, all reasonably priced and I definitely want to come back for the entrees. Today I ordered the Hummus Plate ($7.95, not a fan - pita/chips weren't beyond stale), Philly Pizza ($10.95, perfect for two, deliciously fire baked), and Buffalo Beer Poached Wings ($9.95, blazin' hot delicious - I wanna try the other flavors too).   I can't finish this review without mentioning the beer selection. HOLY SH*T they've got a ton of beer. I was handed the beer menu, saw the front and back and, \"Wow you guys have a lot to choose from\"... Our server Chelsea (super nice) goes, \"That's not everything,\" takes the menu and opens it like a book to reveal two more full pages. Like I said before, holy sh*t.   PKWY Tavern helps you keep track of the beers you've had, the beers you like, and even the beers you request using the aforementioned mobile app. Not only can I track my drinking, but if I consume here frequently I can earn points toward drinks and special events.   I dig it. I already want to go back.",

Some people felt like they were treated differently and others felt like they had a blast. I wanted to watch the basketball game so I decided to come here with an open mind.    FOOD/DRINKS: I've only eaten the pickles and chili. Pickles are delicious and the chili is a bit oily in my opinion. The beer selection is great. Before coming, I suggest signing up for the beer club. You get rewarded for drinking beers basically.   PRICES: Appetizers and starters - $5-10 Entree - $8-15 Beers - $7-10  SERVICE:  I've been here twice and haven't had any issues so far - granted I come here between 7-10pm and by myself. I'm able to find a spot right at the bar and the service has been great. My basketball TV request gets fulfilled and the bartenders check on me frequently for refills.  ENVIRONMENT: I wouldn't say that this place is exactly child friendly, especially at night. They do offer activities such as skee-ball, bowling, oversized Jenna, and oversized Connect 4 but I feel that these are more for adult entertainment (like Dave n Busters). Smoking inside is permitted and in general, it's a bar. But I've seen children wandering around .   Overall, I would come back for drinks and sports. It seems like there are many groups that come here so arriving early would be best if you want a table or a booth.",

    "text": "Went here last night with a friend for happy hour. Heard a lot about it. Walked in, no hostess. Sat ourselves outside at a gross, uncomfortable picnic table. Server came over pretty quickly with menus. Menus were wrinkled, had dried up food on them, not too appetizing.   Happy hour isn't as good as they try to make it seem. Yes, they have an incredible beer selection (I love beer), but the happy hour beer is shit beer like Miller & Bud. No thanks. The good beers are about $7/pint, no happy hour deal. My friend ordered vodka tonic. It had dried up old limes in it. She drank it & told the server it wasn't great. They thought maybe it was the tonic so second drink was a vodka soda. Still not good. Definitely not the tonic.   We ordered jalapeno poppers & spicy chicken tacos. The poppers weren't on the happy hour menu. They were egg roll wrappers with cheese, cream cheese, & a few jalapenos inside. Meh. Tacos were mediocre at best. Three corn tortillas with shredded spicy chicken inside.   They allow smoking which is a huge factor in my decision not to go there again. I see lots of reviews saying the service was bad. Our service was okay, not great but I've had worse. We each had two drinks (two well, two craft beers), and split the jalapeno things & the chicken tacos. Bill was $36 & change.   This place reminds me of an old college bar. I like the concept but it just misses. I dont love the picnic table thing. Food & crap stuck down in the cracks of the table. Yuck. I liked it better when it was the Roadrunner.",

    "text": "If you're trying to figure out what to do on a Friday, Saturday, or heck even a Thursday night - pull through here.  Yes, you weren't confused. Even on a THURSDAY night this place can draw in quite the crowd.  I'm still kind of confused on the 3-star rating because this place deserves nothing, but 5 stars. I brought my friend from San Diego (who use to live in Vegas) and she was pretty blown away at this place. She didn't know there were bars like this outside of the downtown area. The best way for me to describe this place is that it's very similar to Gold Spike without having to deal with downtown traffic. It looks like a decked out back yard party that someone decided to throw while the parents are out of town.  Anyways, they've got the outdoor area with picnic tables for playing beer pong, heater lamps (for those cold winter-y nights), corn hole boards, ping pong tablets, a dj, and a bar. Inside they have even MORE seating, a few arcade games, another bar, and a mini bowling alley. I also believe that's some darts in the far end of the room you can play.  I've gone here several times and will continue coming back several more times. I've always had awesome service and some unforgettable nights here. If you're in town for St. Patrick's Day or Cinco de Mayo, this place really knows how to celebrate those holidays.  I also have to praise this bar for having my favorite gin, Hendrick's. So do me a favor and drink a gin & tonic for me.",

Darts, pool, bowling, jenga, etc.  - Spacious and airy - Large beer selection - Fairly attentive staff (depending on the crowd)  Cons: - Can get extremely busy on weekend nights. After 9 pm, prepare for sardine can-like crowds. - Lousy sound system. When they start cranking the tunes, it's annoyingly loud. There's good loud and there's bad loud. This is bad loud. - Food wasn't so great when we ate there. Could've been an off day, who knows. Not inedible by any means, just not very impressive.  Other notes:  -They do have a beer club (and mobile app to keep track). - I don't get the green wigs some bartenders wear?? They look like a Dr Suess nightmare. -They show UFC fights here for free. - Late nights, pretty much a twenty-something crowd.",

Its mostly a local spot, but if your visiting from out of town and want to avoid the ridiculous costs of food and drinks at The Strip casinos, come here. The local hot women come here too, alot of eye candy. Remember, if you play video poker the drinks are discounted or your comped. Take care of the bartenders and they will go to bat for you. Stiff everyone and be prepared to cough up drink money. Play the double up poker machines, they are the best. Just a great spot to unwind and enjoy yourself. Couldnt recomend any higher !!!!!!!",

We were looking for a fun place to get drinks and meet some new people, which this bar definitely provided that atmosphere. However,  I am taking time out of my day to give them ONE star for their service. I would prefer to give a ZERO if it were permissible. We had the worst service at this place and would never recommend to our friends or clients. The bartender (which we had to ask her name) I believe her name is Jenifer or Jen (shorter, medium body built with lighter hair) seemed more concerned about her own drinks rather then serving paying customers! In addition, would have been nice to not get charged while gambling. Whoever does the training for this place should pay more attention to the behavior of their bar staff and hire people that understands customer service. Or maybe a bartender that is polished.  POOR service don't waste your time here.",

We got to our table I'm not sure if they were short staffed but it took awhile for our waitress to come around . Once we got her attention we ordered our drinks, it was roughly 10 min for her to come back with the wrong drinks ! I didn't see it as a big deal alcohol is alcohol, so I just shrugged it off.   Here's the fun part about our night ! About 5 minuets after that we hear our car license plate number being called over the speakers. My boyfriend goes to see what's the problem. Turns out were being accused of doing donuts in the dirt parking lot! The more amazing part is that \"we busted someone's windshield.\". Security is saying that they had multiple witnesses, and if it wasn't us there security cameras would prove it. We would have to wait 3 days though cause they would have to put in a request to view them ?! As you can imagine I was already upset! We were waiting for the police to get there to file a report . Security kept on letting us know that we can leave, they already had all our information we didn't have to stay. Which I was like hell no ! They were being shady the whole time.   To make a long story short. It wasn't us! After that whole fiasco this place was a horrible first experience for us! Customer service is obviously not their main priority!",

    "text": "Just got back home Parkway Tavern where we celebrated my Husband's birthday. We've been here several times in the past. I enjoy the food and overall atmosphere. It is conveniently located off the 215. Although, this evening I did experience something upsetting (Enough for me to write about). I believe it was racism. We were with a large party and a friend mentioned that he didn't pay his tab, but our server said that everyone had closed out. I wanted to make sure that he was correct. I went to the servers' station. Our server was clearly busy on the register, so I stood there waiting.  A security guard inserted himself in between me and service station/ register area, as if he was blocking me from it. He just stood there, inches from my face, he didn't acknowledge me. He was essentially guarding the register area from me.  There was plenty of room. There was no need to be that close to me. Thank goodness our server turned around saw me and confirmed that all our tabs were indeed paid. Some of our friends paid more than their share. As I walked away, the security guard walked away with me. I didn't think much of it and went back to the party, but other events occurred tonight that led me to believe that there was a hint of racism at this place. It took some time for me to process it. It's hard not to feel insulted. It makes you wonder what you did in order to be identified as the \"Person to keep an eye on.\" Or have the staff watch you. I wasn't unruly, wasn't loud, I wasn't even drinking alcohol. I'm glad I didn't. Otherwise, this post would be classified as the rant of a customer that had one too many. I don't think I'll ever go back, because of what happened this evening.    -S",

Been a few of times and they can never get it right on the drink comps.sometimes they charge and sometimes they don't.everytime I go I usually play $100-$200 but since I play quick they don't think that sitting there for 20-30 mins justifies  2 or 3 free drinks.they lost my business and gaming $. there food btw is subpar and pricey as well, wings waaaay too much sauce and bland.better food down the street @ shucks or sierra gold.",

    "text": "We decided to try out this place and see what the hype was all about. Brought a friends brother who just for back from a deployment over seas. He loved it! The theme of the bar is awesome! Very young and different from most bars in town. Loved the artificial grass outside and the benches and games. The only thing that really rained on our parade was our waitress, I maybe saw her twice our entire time. We ordered the nachos which were a little different with the chips but still good. She didn't come back to check if we were okay or needed anything, (our glasses were all empty.) so we decided we should just go outside to the patio area and just deal with the bar instead. Finally after waiving her down she brought our check and after specifically telling her how we wanted it split, we got one bill... The rest of the night was great after we paid and left the inside portion.   I advise if you go just order from the bar, it's a lot faster and they seem to actually want your money and want to make you drinks.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night for Happy Hour.  There was about 12 of us so pretty decent size group.  No complaints about the food or drinks. They have great happy hour prices.  $3 wells and half off appetizers with generous portions.  Service was a little slow at times and our server, Rebecca, didn't check on us as often as we would have liked but it's a busy place.  Needless to say our bill was pretty hefty even with Happy Hour prices.  Because we all just threw in cash Rebecca's tip went above and beyond any sort of normal gratuity.  Four of us were still chatting at the table and a drink was ordered.  Given the tip amount we figured  Rebecca, might do us a solid and not even charge for that drink but nope bought a bill out for one beer.  I thought that was a poor customer service move on her part.  We walked out around 10 when the music volume increased and bathroom attendants appeared.",

But the service was definitely under manned. We had one waitress for a table of like 20 and she had about 5 other tables to worry about. I think she handled it well but there were other member of the parties that were upset, I think they were overreacting. The food came out really fast though, that was a big plus in my books. Overall good experience, I will most definitely be back.",

The beer selection gets 100 stars even though we did not have beer, it was lunch and we had to go to work.  I plan to go back, they have a huge selection.  The dining area itself I would give 3 stars.  It's not partitioned from the bar so you get that great smokey smell.  The food gets a 5.  We had chicken fingers and fish and chips.  It was not greasy which is a plus, the chips were ok.  We also had the onion rings and they were really good.  It looks like a fun place, pool tables, 2 bowling lanes, darts and jenga.  I could see this place getting crazy on the weekend.  As far as 11am on a Monday, it was quiet.",

We sat, and sat, and sat...  15 minutes went by without even a hello from the bartender.  Trying to be nice and give them a chance as they are relatively new, we waited.  The bartender turns around walks half way down the bar, helps 2 other people that arrived well after us and then walks away without helping us.  So as we get up and start leaving, two patrons, as well as the bartender give us attitude for leaving.  Needless to say, I will not be going back, ever.  I will say that was a while ago, but from what I hear it has not changed...  The owner has reached out and asked for details in order to help them address the problem as well to apologize.  I truly do appreciate that and find it a nice to know that they do care about the patrons. It still may be awhile before I give it a second chance.",

I saw the food pictures and was like YEEEES! So I wore jeans and a light jacket with gym shoes. Big mistake. I should've checked more. This place at night, I don't know in the daytime, is a college nightclub scene with a couple of 30 year old guys trying to hook up with young girls. The girls though do act trashy so there's no helping them there. Either way, big surprise since I was wearing normal hangout clothes and thankfully I wore a jacket cause it's also outside , it's just that you go through a big wooden door that makes you think it's a building. Couldn't even try the food since it was just full of drinking people that were in the way. By the time I got there it seemed that the people working there were tired of dealing with drunks.",

The only thing i had an issue with is that when i first came in, I sat down and clearly was waiting for service and the Mgr instead of making sure I was attended to just continue to talk to his buddies next to me. Bar staff was slow to refill drinks but that's not a deal breaker.... I was playing the machine and won a bit, spent my winnings playing but was still charged for drinks. Whatever....despite those two things I'm happy to drink at this bar",
