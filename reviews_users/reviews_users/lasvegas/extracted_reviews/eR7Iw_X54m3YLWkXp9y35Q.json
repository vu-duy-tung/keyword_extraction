The panko crusting is light and not overly thick and the meat (whether you get chicken or pork) are always moist and succulent.  Food is always cooked fresh to order, every time we've gone.  My kids love the place - how can you beat lightly fried meat with a healthy serving of crispy cabbage and fluffy rice?  Plus they enjoy mixing their own katsu sauce by grinding sesame seeds and pouring in the plum sauce and mustard mix.  Desserts?  Oh man...wait until you try the green tea cheese cake.  Unfailingly out of stock all the time; but if they do have it in, you should order it before your meal -- might not be there for you when you finish!",

You can make your own combination of katsu sauce with sesame seeds as both are available on tubs topping the tables. Be sure to crush your sesame seeds for maximal flavor explosion. The curry tonkatsu option also really hits the spot if you're in the mood for that. Among the appetizers I've tried, the Beef Tataki and Edamame were pretty good. But a darkhorse: the Japanese potato salad, is the real winner in my eyes. The owner and servers are always really nice and attentive. Definitely a great place to check out off the strip.  P.S. No alcohol license yet. When it comes, watch out. Beer mania.",

Very similar to the ones I've tried in Japan, I am really excited that this place is well within my side of town.   However, the place is very small. It seats 6 parties, and they have a bar that can accommodate probably 3 guests. So, I was glad we came on a Tuesday! Another thing is their sodas come in cans. This made my husband almost lose his cool. $1.25 for a can of soda is very un-American for a restaurant. If the soda machine is broken or if you don't have one, I think the customer should know beforehand. Lastly, our server yesterday was very unhappy. She just looked like she wasn't pleased to be working there.   Anyway, we will definitely be coming back here. Personally, to order the same katsu and curry rice combo. We'll probably just get water too ;)",

    "text": "A nice little spot in the southern area of Vegas for Katsu (cutlet) connoisseurs,Tonkatsu Kiyoshi provides a nice change from the many little restaurants in the area by specializing in a dish served in many Japanese restaurants consider mostly to be an afterthought (or an alternative to whatever they specialize in).   Customers are given the option to create their own katsu sauce at their tables,and the katsu itself is fluffy and rich -- unlike the cheap imitations you get at certain Hawaiian spots.   I prefer to order to go instead of dining in (I get the Donburi,which already has its own sauce) as the restaurant is fairly small (only 6-8 tables).   Although the service is good (and the owner is very friendly!),the close proximity of the venue makes for a somewhat uncomfortable setting as the low benches and the servers walking around get a little awkward.   The location of the place -- off of Jones/Robindale in a tiny strip mall -- is also a little hidden,making it somewhat of a mission to go to and parking sometimes a challenge.   Hopefully this place takes off! Would be great in a more central location and in a bigger space because the concept (and the food!) is great.",

The place is small and cozy. We sat at the counter where we had the opportunity to chat with the owner occasionally. She obviously loves what she does there, and it sounds like they've deserved the great success they've had since opening. My husband and I ordered the katsu curry, and it was a huge portion that hit the spot in this cold weather. We wished we'd come here earlier in our trip so that we could eat here TWICE. It was one of the two best meals I had in my week long trip to Vegas, the other being Kyara down the street.  Anyone who loves Japanese comfort food and is visiting Vegas needs to bugger off the strip and come HERE. You get good servings of great food without paying the ridiculous price tag.",

The curry here has the PERFECT taste. It's not too overpowering with the curry taste or smell in your mouth. They have sesame seeds as a condiment on the table, for you to grind up and add more flavor to the curry!   I ordered the tonkatsu curry, it was so delightful! The pork was cooked perfect and so were the vegetables in the curry. I also ordered agedashi tofu and the cold tofu. I'm not a fan of the cold tofu, but the agedashi was so bomb!! It was in some sort of broth that just added more gr8 flavors.   The service was great too! I came in at around 9pm, close to closing. And even though a big party of about 10-14 people just came in, at the same time we did, service was still awesome!! The girl was very attentive and the guy was too- when seating us. :-)  I WILL BE BACKKK!!~~",

Then you add the katsu sauce to your bowl. All of this is available on the table. The curry was mildly spicy, medium think consistency with potatoes and carrots. The pork Katsu was served hot on a bed of rice and a bit of pickled ginger. I would highly recommend anyone to order this dish. The rice and miso came with free refills!",

A traditional Katsu meal with all the fixings. There are sesame seeds that you can grind and add to your dish and/or sauce. Katsu sauce is also available at the table. The best thing about their Katsu is that it's not greasy. It helps that it sits on a mini rack elevated on the plate. The pork was tender and the shrimp was plump and scrumptious. All around fantastic Katsu! I would have liked more and/or different pickled vegetables since my meal came with three pickled garlic bulbs.  Katsu Donburi ($11): Pork Loin Katsu rice bowl with fried egg and dashi. Delicious!! I haven't had very many Donburi, but I imagine as long as the rice, toppings, and dashi broth is good, you're set. Again, great Katsu and the dashi was flavorful. I loved the addition of sunny side-up egg!  Arabiki Sausage ($5): Sauteed Japanese sausages. Great flavor and easy to eat. Accompanied by hot mustard.  Wonderful spot for all your Katsu needs. Make sure to check out the Specials on the wall. We're definitely heading back to try their other dishes!",

    "text": "The food here is authentic and delicious. I always get their hire katsu/pork tenderloin cutlet (13$) whenever I dine here. I normally get chicken katsu at other places but their pork katsu is their best seller and the most tasty. I never get their curry since they're not really known for it (and there are better curry spots in town imo). This place is an absolute must though if you enjoy eating pork or chicken cutlets. Their breading is perfectly crunchy and the meat is very tender and juicy. I like that the food is not oily either. Plus the katsu comes served on top of a rack so it's not soggy. I also like how you can make your own sauce by grinding their sesame seeds & mixing it with their katsu sauce. They offer free refills on the rice , miso soup and shredded cabbage. Entrees range from 10-16$ which is a bit pricey for what it is but when I'm really craving katsu this place always hits the spot. Ambiance is definitely on the casual side. Very friendly Japanese customer service too. It would be awesome if they offered brown rice & was a bit cheaper.",

As soon as we walked in, my friend placed an order for 2 spam musubis, since they usually run out. I was leaning toward getting the katsu donburi but got the pork and shrimp combination instead. While waiting for our food, we ground up some sesame seeds to include with the tonkatsu sauce, which was a fun little ritual. Everything we ate was delicious. The salads were fresh with just the right amount of dressing. The tonkatsu breading was perfect with tender, juicy meat inside. And the miso soup hit the spot. Service was quick and very friendly.",

There was no language barrier, he just seemed entertained with the people he seemed to know instead of dealing with other customers.   He came over about 10minutes after seating us and asked us what we wanted to  order. Explained to him that this was the first time here so we didn't know what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce.   Instead of explaining it, he just put everything into the grinding bowls and started to do it with no smile on his face.   Still this seemed like a cute place so we can overlook the depressing man. We ordered our food and it was good and tasteful. The Donbari, I believe it was called, was flavorful and had a thick cut of pork so worth it.  Service was the thing that knocked this down the furthest. We had to wait FOREVER for our check and then had to called them over to remind them to bring it back... Such a good concept just disapointed in the service. Also, more sauce options would be fantastic.",

We ended up ordering 2 Katsu Curries, Salmon Katsu, and I had the Rosu Katsu.  Also had to get some Shishito Peppers on the side.  All dishes were delicious!  Super light and crispy katsu crusts on every dish, and not at all oily or soggy!  The generous portions and fresh side of cabbage salad was a perfect compliment.  Nice miso soup with the meal.  The lunch crowd was not super busy, and our servers were extremely friendly and helpful.  I love it when they offer up some unsolicited guidance on mixing the ingredients to compliment your dish.  Even if you think you know what you're doing, it's a nice extra step to get the recommendations from the experts.  The restaurant was super clean and nicely adorned with just a few touches that made it feel very comfortable and welcoming.  As we were tending to our bills, the waitress informed us of some specials that were upcoming in the week and shared some photos of the dishes they specialize in that are not on the menu, whilst giving a little background on the chefs origins and why they choose certain dishes to prepare.  On our first visit, they made us feel like regulars.  Great little place!  Will definitely be back!",

Not a huge white rice fan but the rice had great consistency & very tasty. Especially loved the egg on the dish. The pork was breaded perfectly & it was not fried too greasy. Interesting to grind your own sesame seeds & mix it with their sauce. I liked the sauce however I felt it covered up the taste of the Katsu Donburi so I didn't use much of it. I would go back again but it will have to be a while since I am trying to eat healthy & the dish wasn't exactly on the healthy side.",

What's really unique about this restaurant is that they provide you with sesame seeds that you are able to grind yourself and mix with Katsu sauce to create your own sauce. I also really enjoy their Melon Cream Soda. All of the staff members are extremely friendly and welcoming!",

It was super crispy and the sides were great too. Loved the Japanese pickles, never had them before! The portions were super generous. I loved that we could make our sauce as well! Word to the wise, don't grind up too many sesame seeds... Love the fresh flavor of sesame in the dipping sauce though and I added in some spicy mustard for a kick! We'll be back for sure. Worth the drive from the east side! P.S. The melon cream soda, just treat yourself!",

So we decided to check this place out, I was so happy we did. Upon arriving I thought we were lost, but this is somewhat hidden in a complex of little shops.   The first moment I walked in, I was very pleased. It smelled so good, it wasn't just the aroma of the food, but there was a slight sweet smell. Almost like flowers. Hah, that's kind of weird, but trust me, when you walk in, it brings you right in! The people there are super friendly! At first we sat down at a table, but we decided we wanted to sit at the bar. There is a place you can hang your purse from, that was a nice touch. The menu's were simple and to the point. Sometimes looking at too many items can be overwhelming. We ordered the chicken katsu and the pork tonkatsu. It came with all the trimmings!  The katsu was amazing. The right amount of crunch, everything that was on the plate complimented each other so well. I wish I could eat here all the time. Hehe. Every time I have a chicken katsu, I always compare it to this place. Nothing ever comes close. They also have green tea cheesecake sometimes, you just have to ask if they have it! It comes from LA, yummiest green tea cheesecake ever. I love this place!",

Ordered in a couple minutes and got the food within 10.  - Best part, unlimited katsu sauce! McDs should take notes! haha charging extra for McNuggets dip. shame. HA!  - Katsu was pretty good. crispy. Chicken better pork here.  - Huge pieces of shrimp katsu! My favorite!  - Loved the pickled scallions. But 2 though....tease - Shredded cabbage. Yum. - Curry was very good. Few pieces of carrots and potato. Sorta better than Kaba Curry, but it would be cool if you can order their curry spicier. Slap a fried egg on top. - For better Katsu in Vegas, go to Yu-Yu for lunch! Better soup! No miso. And their pestle looks like bark from a tree! haha, even more authentic. I think it starts at $9.  - For SoCal-ers, Meh, Yoko and Katsuko in Buena Park is better and cheaper. Usually $9 and you get udon with side banchan. You'd think this place is pretty steep. Over 30 for katsu here! What. haha.  - Aside from all that, this place is fantastic and will definitely come back for more but during dinner time.",

Did I keep on living my life knowing my Az Yet secret was revealed at a tonkatsu house? You know it.   Fortunate that my family lives pretty close to this place.  It's inside of a strip mall in a quiet, residential neighborhood. Definite must-try if you are in this area, which is kinda far from the Strip.  The first thing you do when you sit down is grind your own sesame seeds to make your dipping sauce. The mortar-and-pestle workout I call it. Then add katsu sauce to your creation.  We tried the panko crusted soft shell crab to start and it was excellent.  The shrimp and chicken katsu dinner was not at all greasy and very tasty. I think having the katsu rest and served  on a metal grate keeps it from getting soggy.  It comes out light and crispy.   I don't think you can go wrong with ordering any of the katsu they offer.  The staff is friendly and the prices are alright in my book. When we left the ipod was playing Shai. Are you serious?! I fully expect to hear some Jodeci or Hi-Five when I go back.",

So keep in mind this place opens at 5pm. and closed on Tuesday/Wednesday so if you are craving tonkatsu outside of those times, then you are SOL. And I mean you are SOL because the dishes here are the best in town. That's just my opinion. All orders come with miso soup, scoop of rice, and Japanese pickles (looks like pickled garlic). All plates come with the katsu set on wire and a bed of shredded cabbage. The presentation is actually quite impressive. The chicken cutlet and shrimp cutlet are very crunchy and flavorful. I also tried their fried spam musubi and OMG. HEAVEN. Dip the musubi into the sauce that accompanies it and you'll wish they were open all day, everyday. Service here is on point especially since it is small so if you have a big group go once they open or you may have to wait. There are about 8 tables and a few bar seating's to choose from.  The prices are very reasonable for all the food they give you.",

You're immediately greeted when you walk in and they promptly seat you. We came at a perfect time (~8pm) because it wasn't busy at all. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted so our server was very patient and got our drinks. He was very enthusiastic -- which is hard to find in some servers nowadays. He made sure he was available for us when we did decide what we wanted.  *Check in on Yelp to get free potato salad OR seaweed salad (**one per table though!). I'm still iffy about any kind of potato salad and it threw me off what there were little pieces of apples in this potato salad. It was still good, though.   Once you get your food, the server shows it how to make your own mixture of katsu sauce. There are two bowls -- one with katsu sauce, one with sesame seeds. You put the sesame seeds in another bowl and grind it, then add katsu sauce! I love sesame seeds so I grind a lot for me.   I ordered the ebi (shrimp) katsu curry. Yum, yum! The portions were good sized: half the plate was rice, the other half was curry (with potatoes and carrots) & two jumbo shrimps (I wish I got one more shrimp for it being $15). The plate also came wth salad and miso soup on the side, so I guess that made up for the price.   I love this place and the food is amazing, but I'd probably only come when I've saved enough money to spend $15 on a plate.",

Located in a small business center on the SE corner of Jones and Robindale, you will wonder why it's not located somewhere in Chinatown or closer to the strip!   It appears to be owned and operated by a family and they really show it with their politeness and smiles when you enter in and as you dine in. The kind of service they provide couldn't be any better. They have about 6 tables (can sit 4 each) and a bar top at the end of the restaurant that is right next to the kitchen.  At the table, there are empty bowls provided along with a sesame grinder so that you can grind some sesame seeds and pour some katsu sauce in after. It's almost a tradition for me to do that while I wait for my food to arrive! Depending on what you order will determine if you would need it. Even if what I order already has sauce (like the curry) I still grind some sesame seeds and use some katsu sauce on some occasional bites!   My favorite dishes:  -Tori Katsu Dinner (Chicken Katsu Cutlet) which include: Chicken katsu laid on a raised metal grate so that it doesn't get soggy, some finely shredded cabbage on the side, along with rice, and a side of miso soup.  -Chicken Katsu Curry which includes: Chicken Katsu laid above a serving of curry that has potatos and carrots, and rice.  -Katsu Donburi which I substitute the pork for chicken, but it is a wonderful serving of Chicken katsu served above a bowl of rice mixed with egg, sauce, and some onions.  -Chicken Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) for appetizer  The Katsu is always breaded and cooked to perfection. Quality of food mixed with their courteous service makes this place an A+ in my book.",

After noticing that they charge $1 for a water, I decided to just order a $5 Asahi LOL (edit: They actually only charge for bottled water) I also did the yelp check-in for the potato salad. However, it was too sour for my liking. Overall 5 stars because the food, service, and atmosphere was great!  Looking forward to coming back.",

    "text": "My second visit to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi...can I just say \"Katsu!!\"  While their Japanese curry isn't my favorite in town, everything else intertwines perfectly...you know, the way grounded Sesame seeds and Katsu sauce go together...oh, and by the way YOU grind your sesame seeds here the way you like, as fine as powder or as corse as sand...then you put the Katsu sauce, mix it together, and just wait until the very professional and warm server brings you your tray full of fresh and crispy Katsu.   Every table is already set to make your Katsu sauce...Sesame seeds and Katsu sauce. A server will bring you a bowls and wands to grind the sesame seeds according to the number of people in your party.     You can have traditional Tonkatsu (pork loin), Tori Katsu (chicken), Ebi Katsu (shrimp) or Sake Katsu (salmon).  The set menus all come with a bowl of white steamed rice, miso soup, and Japanese pickles. We also had Tori Katsu Curry...comes with a miso soup and salad.   You can cool down with Ashahi beer, other varieties of alcoholic beverages or just water.  Four of us came this time and shared all different kinds of Katsu except for pork loin...but I am sure it is as great as the other Kastu, after all, their name Tonkatsu Kiyoshi represents the pork.  People say when in doubt, you fry it or put bacon on it...Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does work magic with frying and pork...so when you are in mood for something you can count on, come on in. A well deserving thanks to the servers who accommodated our seating needs during our dinner, as well as the gentleman who gave us his seat...",

This place is literally less than a mile away from me, very convenient for me to come by whenever I crave some Japanese katsu or order to-go for pick up on those lazy days.   I usually order one out of the three: tori katsu, chicken katsu curry, or chicken katsu donburi. Everything is so good here and it's all because of their breeding of the katsu! Has the perfect texture and crisp. I love that you can adjust your katsu sauce to your liking by crushing your own sesame! I may or may not be the only one but I also really love their cabbage salad that comes with the tori katsu set!   I can't end my review without mentioning their customer service. Man, this mom & pop place really knows how to run their business! They're super friendly, takes pride in their food and you just feel the welcoming vibe as soon as you walk in! They always have smiles on their faces! I can't rave about this place enough, and don't know why it took me this long to leave a review. Go and try yourself!",

    "text": "\"We're a Katsu House, not a Curry House.\" - Owner of Tonkatsu Kiyoshi  There are only a couple of options in Vegas for quality katsu...Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is one of them. I love the pride they take in their product here. I once asked if they were able to make the curry in the katsu dinner spicy, that was when I was told, \"We're a Katsu House, not a Curry House.\" At first you might be taken back from that comment, but as you spend any time here it is readily evident that they are highly passionate about their katsu...and that comes through in the quality of their food.  They will recommend the Hire (Pork Tenderloin) Katsu if you ask. I shared this the first time I came here, and, while good, I haven't ordered it again. Instead I usually get the Tori (Chicken) Katsu Dinner...I like the flavor of the chicken more, but I eat a lot more chicken than pork, so I may be biased and you may need to try them both and decide. The last time I was here was my favorite visit and opened me up to even more possibilities. I came in with my love and her daughter and we shared Tori Katsu, Ebi (Shrimp) Fry, and Salmon (Salmon) Fry. The salmon was the hit of the table, but everything was absolutely enjoyed...so we may need to come again with 3 or 4 of us to continue to be able to share a few items.  We also enjoyed the opportunity to make our sauce by grinding the sesame seeds with the pestle and mortar. I brought my sister here previously and the simple act of grinding the seeds was memorable part of that experience as well.  There are curry options in the specials section of their menu...they are solid options...definitely not to be avoided...but again, they're a katsu house, not a curry house, and there are slightly better curry options in town IMHO.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is certainly worth trying out if you like pork or chicken cutlets...and an absolute must if you like katsu as it's one of the best in town!",

Table has fresh sesame that you can ground up before pouring sauce on top. Dip your katsu in there and it's like heaven on earth. A decent selection of sake and drinks are available. The staff is also very nice. Not much here to say, except it is delicious food in a casual, traditional environment. I did notice that after they took away the wood pestle from our table they handed it to another customer which is not the most hygienic but it's not the biggest infraction I have ever seen in my whole life. Other than that tiny hiccup, it was a great meal and I would not hesitate to return.",

    "text": "As a native and local of San Francisco, being at my second home away from home can be a scary thought when it comes to food.  SF is hands down the best when it comes to amazing food packed into a small little city.  Anywhere you walk can potentially land you at an award winning restaurant... Even if not, the quality and flavors wouldn't be far off from being some of the best in the US.  The contrast would be Las Vegas.  The city is large and desolate when away from the busy vegas strip, and plazas w restaurants are plenty...... Getting your money's worth of good eats can be a real gamble.  Well, what did you expect?  You are in vegas after all.  When it comes to your money, everything is a gamble here.  Even a good bite.  If you intend on gambling your hard earned money on a good japanese curry, I'd say Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a sure bet.  It's run by a family of Hawaiians serving up some really tasty dishes of curry.  Decor is inviting, simple, and clean.  Energy is good.  Expect to greeted in warm friendly fashion.  The lady whom I'd assume is part of the ownership was very caring when it came to their patrons from what I saw, as she engaged myself and others in a good old fashion chit chat.  As we spoke of random things from Hawaii to Las Vegas real estate, she slides over 2 wooden containers to me along w a pestle.  She says, \"Use this and make your own sauce.\"  One was filled w toasted sesame while the other contained a sweet savory tangy Japanese bbq type sauce usually used w Tonkatsu or other fried foods.  So I took the pestle w one hand and scooped a mini ladle full of sesame into my little mortar w the other.  Mid way thru the grinding, the earthy and peanutty aroma began to release, caressing my appetite.  What a pleasant way to start my lunch.  My long awaited curry finally came my way.  The colors n the smell of curry was enough to make me throw my face into it... What etiquette?  None.   That first spoonful of fluffy japanese rice smothered in curry and crispy Panko crusted porkchop aka tonkatsu w a golden creamy runny yolk just made my entire day.  It was only a matter of minutes that I realized the plate was empty.  The struggle between being stuffed and wishing there was more.  The struggle was real.    Although on the pricey side I feel at 19 bucks after adding an egg n tips, it was a very solid plate of Japanese comfort.  Writing this review just made me want to go get some curry for lunch... Ok I'm getting curry for lunch.",

Pros:  Attention to detail to service, restaurant, dishes, presentation; quality food; great taste.   Cons:  Menu options (maybe adding a Chef Special item would bring diversity to customers); adding history to the brand (how Tonkatsu Kiyoshi started) would definetley benefit the already homey feel to the restaurant;  more engaging service.   Much potential for this restaurant. Will definitely visit again for more curry.   4.5 out of 5.",

    "text": "I forgot to ask who Kiyoshi was!  All I know is that it is a common Japanese boy's name.  Tonkatsu on the other hand (which I often confuse with Tonkotsu) is deep fried panko-breaded pork cutlet.  Just like breaded pork chop, Japanese style. When you enter the place, it looks very Japanese with the set-up and decor, but there was summer-y Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is tiny and I'm glad we went at an odd hour.  If we came more hungry, I would've wanted to try their beef tataki and daily special off menu agedashi tofu.  But today, we went straight to the entrees.  We had...   1. The miso soup which came with both our orders.  This was awesome, definitely a notch above your standard bowls in Jap restaurants.    2. The Katsu Curry which has 2 pork cutlets, lots of rice, lots of curry with chunks of potato and carrot.  Their katsu preparation is good - thick cuts that maintain their juiciness with breading that is light and not greasy.  Their curry sauce has much stronger flavors than your typical Japanese curry, in fact, it really reminded me of the Indian version.  Hubby enjoyed it.  3. The Katsudon (Katsu donburi) has katsu over rice topped with egg and katsudon sauce (which is a savory-sweet sauce).  There were a couple of grilled shishito peppers on the side as well.  The katsu itself is not salty and is meant to be dipped in curry or tonkatsu sauce so I wish this thin type sauce was tastier.  It was, however, still very good.   4. Chicken Karaage for the lil man.  This was a very different preparation from the karaages in ramen joints.  The batter is not as light and the piece of chicken is denser.  Although good, I prefer the ramen joint version a lot better.   5. Japanese potato salad.  This is a sweeter version of a classic with eggs and cucumbers.  A refreshing side to cut the fried goodness.  6. Melon soda.  It comes in a bottle and I didn't care for this too much because it has a Yakult after taste.  But hubby loved it so much he asked for one to go.  Try it if you haven't had any melon soda yet.  7. Their tonkatsu dipping sauce.  I love places that serve condiments.  I really do.  Each table comes with sauce and roasted sesame seeds which you grind yourself with a wooden pestle.  The tonkatsu sauce tastes like the Bulldog bottles you buy in Jap grocery stores.  If you haven't had this condiment, you might really love it or find it weird because it is slightly sour.  Kinda like catsup meets soy sauce meets sugar meets Worcestershire sauce.  I like it though.  And normally, I don't care much for sesame seeds but man!  The roasted sesame flakes on this tonkatsu sauce really elevates it to another level.  Real good stuff.  We enjoyed our meal a lot, and service rocked.  However, for the 2 entrees, 2 sides and 4 drinks, our bill was already over $50 with tip.  It's not cheap, and I wish it was so I can keep coming back.  But if you are a fan of fried Japanese goodness, then you might end up being a Kiyoshi groupie.",

My last visit had a large group for dinner on a weeknight.  They accommodated all our orders as well as split checks which was awesome, kudos to their staff for satisfying multiple customers.  I had the special katsu donburi and it tasted really good, it comes with main entree as well as miso soup, and salad.  The items on menu are a little pricey, but if you love katsu it's worth the price.  Also, I love how you can customize your dipping sauce by adding fresh ground sesame seeds and mixing yourself.",

    "text": "When I was in Asia I was a little obsessed with this katsu house and ate there once a week with my mom. It made me think that I didn't know where exceptional katsu was and behold - I came home and this was newly opened! Wishes answered!   The BF and I got the Hire (pork tenderloin) and the Rosu (thick cut pork loin) to compare the two tonkatsu offerings. We both liked the hire better which is thinner sliced, a bit more tender and had more crunch to meat ratio. The rosu is good if you like a meatier, pork chop type cut. If pork isn't your thing, they have seafood and chicken katsu offerings.  Each meal comes with thin shaved cabbage with a refreshing yuzu dressing, lovely sticky rice, rakkyo pickles, and a stronger than average miso soup. It makes for a simple and comforting meal. I thought the portions were good as we were both comfortably full. Your katsu sauce is a interactive type thing. You grind your sesame seeds and mix with the katsu sauce to your liking from a tray on your table. I don't know if it is homemade sauce, but I thought it was balanced flavor.   Service was friendly and decent. There was chatter of Japanese patrons enjoying their meal which was comforting. It definitely is one of the better katsu to be had in this city, quite on par with some favorites I have outside of Vegas. Most definitely will be back!",

    "text": "Lost in translation?  What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.  What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.    What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.  Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.",

This is not your  L&L fast food katsu or island style (sorry not bagging on my 808 people) that comes to mind when most people think of katsu. This is katsu straight from the motherland. The mark of a legit Japanese katsu-ya: suribachi and surikogi for grinding fresh sesame for katsu sauce at the table. Once I saw this, I knew we found a legit motherland katsu spot.  Unlike most katsu-ya in Japan the cabbage salad is not unlimited (which is fine) and karashi (spicy mustard) is not served by default. I recommend that you ask for a bit of karashi for you katsu.   Here is the breakdown of the eats:  Karaage: legit Japanese! Rosu Katsu: legit Japanese! Curry: Homestyle legit Japanese!  I don't know how to explain it any better. If you want REAL Japanese katsu, come here!  For those of you who are hesitant on giving this place a try, think of it this way; when you want a quick burger you go to McDonalds, when you want a good quality burger you go to _______________ (insert favorite burger boutique name here). This is the same thought process you should use when debating over katsu. If you want quick food; go to L&L. If you want a good quality katsu; go to Tonkatsu kiyoshi.   It's really that simple.   Find more real Japanese eats like this on my \"Real Japanese food made by real Japanese people\" list in Yelp.",

Something about how they cook things, prepare things, treat their customers... it all just works together! The breading they use is fresh, which makes any leftovers still amazing the next day (none of that hardened meat or crust here), and trust me, I hate leftovers, but here, they work! The owners are a super sweet family that remembered us from our first visit (including remembering that we over order and need to-go boxes) and are extremely attentive. I honestly love everything about this place, from the presentation of their dishes, to the little touches they add to make your visit comfortable and welcoming. Their menu isn't extensive, but what they do have, they do it well and with love. I prefer the chicken katsu, but I was eyeing the shrimp on my last visit, so I'll have to do their combo chicken/shrimp next. My fiance prefers the pork katsu and also raved about the quality of their curry. The couple next to us was talking about how the water here is really good.. and I actually have to agree! I really also enjoy their hot tea, which the owner told us was his favorite tea from the first Japanese restaurant he worked at. I already can't wait to go back again!  Side note: I've been really bad at writing reviews and posting pics lately, but this place has inspired me to write again. Great products and service deserve to be talked about, and sometimes that's overshadowed by internal/external ranting and raving about crappy places.",

    "text": "Heard about this place from my boyfriend and all his (foodie) roommates as they live really close to this new place. Funny thing is they, initially, came here for Rice Trax - the local Hawaiian spot that was previously there. They raved about the chicken karaage and his instagram video of his DIY tonkatsu sauce intrigued me.   Luckily, my brother and his family took me here for a belated birthday lunch.  Decorated with those \"good luck\" bamboo plants/trees, various Asian prints and curtains. What a difference interior design makes in a place...It's hard to believe that Rice Trax was here.   Of course, the 1st thing I did when I sat was make my very own tonkatsu sauce. Kinda fun as I've never used a mortar before. My nephew (who doesn't like sauces of any sort) even had me make some for him.  We ordered the katsu curry, chicken karaage, beef tatake, edamame, and salmon katsu.  - Beef tataki was the winner for me. Seared beef and ponzu sauce are always a win. - Chicken karaage had a nice breading on it, which also made for crispy \"fried chicken.\" But, the chicken wasn't burnt. Thin pieces of chicken which made for fairly juicy chicken. - Katsu curry was nice. Wish the curry was a little more spicy but nothing a few chili peppers (on the side) can't solve. - Salmon curry was breaded as nicely as the chicken karaage and katsu. Salmon was pretty thick and didn't fall apart when bitten. The best part of that salmon katsu was the salad that came with it. Standard Asian cabbage/slaw but, the yuzo/ponzu dressing was amazing! The owners came by to give us more dressing =) - Pickled onions, cucumbers on the side were delish. You can tell the freshness and that it was homemade. The owners were telling us that they get many requests for kim chee so, that may be a possibility.  Overall great experience an the food was very good. Nice to have a tonkatsu spot in the area as tonkatsu this good is few and far between. Service was great. You can tell it's a family run business and the owners take pride in the food they serve!",

My bf usually gets the Katsu Donburi but instead of pork he asks for chicken katsu and they always accommodate our request nicely! Our Yelp check in got us a free seaweed salad which was just as yummy. The owner is always so very welcoming whenever we come by and automatically knows our orders because we go here so many times haha! They also have other items such as salmon katsu, shrimp katsu, takoyaki, and desserts such as green tea cheesecake! Their combo plates are also great for you can get half shrimp katsu and half chicken katsu! Definitely try this place out if you're looking for some great, tender, and delicious katsu! :)",

The cuts of the pork were too lean.   Would have been nice if the portions of the cutlets were a bit larger. The rice was not Japanese rice (authentic Japanese rice with tonkatsu is key in my opinion), and the potato salad was what you could find at a supermarket.  The miso was so-so.  They charge for hot tea which was very surprising since it was lukewarm and not particularly of high quality.  Typically a tonkatsu place would not charge for basic hot tea.  All in all, it's fine, a bit pricier than I expected.  Service was friendly but the place was understaffed.  It may be one of the better katsu places in Vegas but Vegas is not really a hotbed for Japanese cuisine so it's all relative. I find the katsu here about the same as served at Yu-Yu.",

    "text": "Sorry mom, I found a place that beats your tonkatsu. When I moved to Las Vegas in 1996 there wasn't many japanese food options. Let a lone restaurants who were doing specific Items really well. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet, Panko breaking and deep friend served with a dipping sauce) is one of my favorite japanese comfort foods and a dish that my mother does very well.   The owner/chef goes to the market every morning to pick up ingredients for the day. No frozen meat or left overs from the day before. This shows in the quality of the pork and the freshness of the greens. The tonkatsu is cooked perfectly and the pork is tender, not chewy like you may find at some hawaiian plate lunch places or lesser quality japanese restaurants. For the sauce, they recommend grinding up sesame seeds at ur table and mixing it with the sauce. I've never had it this way before and I'm now a huge fan. For their salad dressing they made an in house ume boshi and ponzu sauce. Two of my favorite flavors. When ever I'm in the area I make sure to stop in or take out.   Likes: superb quality, family owned, friendly service, fresh ingredients  Dislike: it's not 24hrs lol",

As a frequent visitor to tonkatsu spots during my business trips to Japan, it was an amazing feeling walking into Tonkatsu Kiyoshi and being presented with the traditional mortar and pestle to grind my own sesame seeds.   The tonkatsu here is excellent - the pork is juicy while the breading is light and perfectly crispy - very well executed. I usually get the katsu curry, which comes with a sizable amount of rice and curry. Don't forget the sides like the Japanese-style potato salad and the wonderful melon cream soda with ice cream.  I don't live anywhere near this place, but it is well worth the trip. Thanks again, Yelpers!",

The tala Alsalad on the Katsu and shrimp combo was off the hook. Yeah I said salad. Leave it alone. Carnivores eat grass when they have too also.

    "text": "Try this place now! If you are in the south part of Vegas south of the 215, this is a great place to stop and try.  We drove out here to try it out from Henderson and it was totally worth it. As usual, I read reviews before trying this place out / driving 15 miles and the reviews of Rod U, Lawrence C and Jennifer D caused me to be quite ready for this evening's quest.  a. Normally - I am normally getting Tonkatsu or Chicken Katsu from a place like L and L Hawaiian.  Oddly, there was an L and L a few blocks away from this place.  While I find it extremely convenient to get it from L and L, I also know it is like me getting chow mein or fried rice at Panda.  Edible, comforting, but just not the same.  Here at TK, this is the real deal in Tonkatsu.  b.  Ahhh Curry - There are a few pleasures in foodie life and Japanese Curry is one of them. I love all types of curry, = Thai, Indian, Chinese, Japanese.  From the hottest to the mildest.  However, I find that the Japanese Curry like what they have here is simply the best. If you like mild curry over rice with carrots and potatoes, this is it.  c.  Miso Soup - I pretty much always have miso paste at home and make plenty of variations of miso soup from hearty vegetables soup to your basic miso.  I consider myself a Miso fan and the miso here is pretty darn good. Finished mine and most of my wives.  Yep, and I slurped it all without using a spoon.  Just slurped away and used the chopsticks.  Now, while I am not Japanese, I find that eating the soup like they do in Japan, by putting your mouth to the bowl and drinking, using the chopsticks for the bits you cannot swaggle down is a great way to enjoy the soup. Here the soup was just right. Be sure to chuggle it down while it is hot. I also keep getting spell check warnings here, so I am sure swaggle and chuggle are not words but that is what comes to mind with this Miso Soup.  d.  The TK Sauce - What am I to do with the sesame seed and the tonkatsu sauce, mortar and pestle?  See, I have been trained to eat tonkatsu at L and L and am used to having the sauce in a little plastic takeaway thingamajig.  Here you get to pour out a good spoonful or so of sesame seed, and use the pestle to grind down the seeds to mix it with the sauce.  That was fun and since I did not have a clue, I had to ask the waitress how on rudimentary tonkatsu sauce preparation.  I am so glad I did, i love learning about foods and processes and tradition. And, this was FUN!  e.  What to order - I was totally befuddled in what to order. While my wife ordered the \"Hire\" tonkatsu, I was stuck between the Hire,, the Ebi and the Curry. Reading the reviews and all, I wanted to try them all.  So, I asked the waitress, what to do what to do.  See, there relatively small but perfect menu did not have this combo on it.  So she said, order the Hire, Ebi, Curry combo.  Yep, they said they could put that together no problem!  That was cool.  Hire Katsu - Plenty big portion and very tender and crispy, light and delicate.  I really enjoyed it, okay, compared to my norm and limited experience.  Miso Soup, Shaved Cabbage, Scallion and a sauce for the cabbage round out this dish. All was just right. I could have ate a bunch more of the pickled scallion, Rakkyo, they give you.  Curry - The plate was in a yin yang fashion with Japanese rice on the yin and the curry on the yang.  Then, a bit of Hire Katsu and Ebi Katsu on the rice.  If you are ancient like I am, it was like that old tootsie pop commercial where the kid is trying to find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop.  (See this youtube if you are too young).  Anyhoo,  I was pretty darn anxious to get to the curry and rice so I am not sure but I did a David Copperfield on the Ebi and Hire Katsu and they disappeared quickly. Then I got to the curry and rice.  I have not been eating white rice for a long time and here I made an exception because this was like the best ono thing to do!  Hot Tea - I ordered hot tea and got an ever filling cup of ocha, that was pretty darn good.  Could have been a bit hotter, but it was full of flavor.  f.  How about that service - Now, the last place I was at, was Bachi Burger for the wifey's birthday and well, the service from the maitre'd, shift manager and server was absolutely horrendous, I can tell you that the service here is the exact opposite!  WE have very attentive service, from the host, the waitress, to the big guy checking on us.  I mean, I felt like I was at a five star dining service or flying first class on Singapore Airlines.  It was just right.   In the end, we were so happy with the food, the service, the experience, we actually ordered two more dishes for take out. We are thinking about sharing this with the kids who were out with friends while we were basking in the glories of tonkatsu delight.  Three - That is how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop!",

And i'm not even a Tonkatsu fan but I really liked this!  Today we had a late lunch and we both ordered the Tonkatsu Donburi and ordered the combo Chicken and Shrimp plate for Hunnie Bunnie, The combo plate is LARGE! and is accompanied by a bowl of Miso soup and White Rice.  The Tonkatsu Donburi bowl has a large portion of rice and a thick cut of pork, nicely breaded with good flavor and egg and onions plus two Shishito peppers - my fave! I guess I just LOVE pork cuz I totally LOVE this dish! It was A LOT of food too so I totally have leftovers.  We also had a full order of Shishito peppers - I could eat these all day, ALL DAY! An order of Edamame for Hunnie Bunnie and an order of the Cold Tofu which was surprisingly good because I usually don't like cold tofu.  This is a small restaurant with some awesome Katsu!",

    "text": "My fellow Yelp Elite buddy wanted to come here but we realized it was only opened for dinner.    So, I went without her, with my friends and family.  The ratings looked so good!  But I was disappointed, yet glad I didn't come with my friend.  I checked in on Yelp, and scored a free potato salad.  It was the first thing I did when I saw the server, and she congratulated me on it.  We then ordered the tonkatsu, tonkatsu with curry, edamame, takoyaki, shishito peppers, and fried spam musubi.  The shishito peppers weren't special.  They were lightly coated with salt.  There was no other taste.  Everywhere I go, if I see it on the menu, I'll order this dish, so I'm not new to shishito peppers, but this was the most boring.  But I forced myself to eat them all.  The musubi was small.  I didn't try it, but I didn't hear anything about it from those who ate it.  The takoyaki was just ok.  There weren't many pieces of tako in it, and even though I like it that way, the flavor even with the sauces wasn't there.  The food comes out at different times.  Halfway through the service, we decide to ask about the potato salad and the edamame, which somehow must have been stuck in traffic....The server acknowledged the missing items without an apology, and at some point later the potato salad arrives.  It was blah.  It wasn't special.  We all tasted it-but none of us were impressed.  But where did the edamame go???  We waited and waited.  At some point my sister saw it hanging out on the counter, just waiting for someone to bring it over since it didn't have legs.  We waited and waited, and I could feel the tension at the table-someone was going to burst, it was just a matter of who and when!  You know the feeling....  But alas, we took some deep breaths and out came the edamame.  It was a small serving, but what was worse, was it was cold, and dry!  I mean, the outside was moist, but the beans inside were dry and hard.  We supposed and gathered they must have been precooked and frozen then thawed or reheated.  Regardless, we only ate three pods before we just gave up.  The tonkatsu wasn't bad.  If it was all I ordered and experienced, I'd probably rate it 3 stars.    Yelp 2017 challenge 29/100",

You can get tonkatsu at many places, but it just tastes better here. Everything is quality, and the presentation is great.   From crushing sesame seeds, to creating your own tonkatsu sauce - to the texture and crispness of the pork cutlets, served on a mesh screen to make sure the underside of the cutlet does not get soggy - is pure perfection.   For you curry lovers, this is one of the best I have tasted.  Did I mention they have excellent miso soup and you can always start with chicken karaagi? Definitely check in to receive a free potato salad.  Note that they are closed Tuesday and Wednesday.",

You sit down and can make your own sesame paste/ katsu sauce and then they serve you a bento style meal. It comes with miso soup, cabbage salad, katsu, and pickled onion. The meat is next and juicy with the breading crispy. Over all great place on occasion but I'm not sure if I could justify the price all the time.",

What makes it special is the fluffy/marshmallow like tenderness of the meats: chicken and pork mainly.  Biting into it is the tenderest pork and chicken I have ever had. 3. Also, you are given sesame seeds to grind and tonkatsu sauce.  Combination of the two come together like foodie \"heaven\" - as in so addictive  4. Served with rice, miso soup/tofu, shredded cabbage and unique dressings like ume and yuzu lemon.   5. They have a number of other offerings like gyoza and chicken karaage but the tonkatsu is the real showstopper.  Usually also get 'ebi fry' fried shrimp to make it an extra special occasion.    Service: 1. I met Meredith for the first time, she is a familiar face here.  One of the friendliest and funniest business owner/restauranteur I have met here in Vegas. She has monopolized this unique style dining I have only had in Asia known as \"Saboten\".   2.  I wanna go back soon!  Ambiance 3. Quaint, small and cannot seat many.  Makes the restaurant feel like there are never enough tables and is constantly busy from what I have seen.  Sometimes wait time can get lengthy, but I do believe it is worth it.  MoJo 1. Says it all, very very tender pork/chicken fried to perfection and delicious sauces.  Enough said",

    "text": "I traveled to Tokyo last year, and have struggled to find food/cuisine authentic to Japan. Tonkatsu Kiyoshi delivers on my expectations. The curry is a highlight for me. I go to one of the competitors, Zen Curry, pretty regularly. However, now that I've gone here I don't think I'll go to Zen anymore. The depth of flavor is spectacular. The Japanese pickles are the right accompaniment to the curry's richness. The katsu is wonderfully crisp, and they offer a perfect portion size for me. I highly suggest this restaurant. I think it would appeal to even people not familiar with this style of cuisine.",

It's a small place with a few tables and just good vibes and great service.  The servers are always so helpful and nice.  Before ordering be sure to checkout their specials that are not on the menu on a little black board on the wall next to the cash register.   I ordered a side of curry, rice, and the chicken karaage I know I just misspelled that lol.  It came with a small salad and some miso soup.   The first time we came here I learned that if you crush up the sesame seeds it releases the natural oils and brings out the flavor of the curry.  Not only was the super fun but it was yummerz!  I always look forward to crushing my seeds lol.   If you check in with yelp you get a free potato salad which was onolicious!  This is my go to curry spot!  The food I always so good and the portions are huge and the prices a tiny!",

    "text": "My FAVORITE Katsu place in Vegas! They have their recipe perfected here. The batter itself on anything you order here is nice and crispy in that nice light airy way if that makes sense lol It's not dry and hard like all the other Katsu served in town.   Service is excellent!! Upon arriving we are always greeted   with a warm welcoming smile & hello from Meredith (Owner) and the rest of the staff. We see the owner every time we dine in or come in to pick up our take out order we placed over the phone. She is very nice and attentive.  Price is a bit up there $10-16 per meal but the portions are pretty big depending on how hungry you are of course. Katsu meals come with miso soup, rice, Japanese pickles, cabbage salad, and your choice of Katsu.   Ebi & Salmon Katsu - Great! Ebi are Tiger Prawns so are pretty big. Salmon is delicious! Perfectly cooked not dry  Chicken Katsu - Good! Moist not dry  Pork Katsu - Great!  Curry - I love their curry here. It's nice and thick like how Japanese curry should be  Beef Tataki - perfectly seasoned. Smaller sized portion  Croquettes - really good! Same batter as the Katsu   Potatoe salad - good  Deep Fried Spam Musubi - Excellent! Only place in town I know that makes this here so far.   We come here all the time. Food and service is delicious. My kids love coming here also bc they get to make their own sauce by grinding up the sesame seeds to mix with the Katsu sauce. Goes great with everything. Definitely recommend this place to everyone",

Having just returned from a trip in Japan, its cruel to compare to the tonkatsu eaten there (heavenly!) but I thought the meat was very tender. Still, compared to Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin in Waikiki, it falls short in the lack of thickness  of meat and less crispy panko breading. The free potato salad was actually the surprise standout and I actually want more as I think about it now! It had a sweet and vinegary tang and the texture was chunky goodness with cucumber, egg and apple. Delish!!  Location: in a non-descript strip mall hidden behind a bar. Parking was easy.   Service: owner was very friendly and welcoming.   Will be back for now potato salad!!",

The food was great, the service was great, price is great. I like the relaxing island vibe music, I was in such a good mood here!! I feel the only thing that would make the experience better would be some work on the decor.

    "text": "I keep meaning to take photos everytime I eat here, but I end up snarfing down the food before I remember to take the picture.  This place is amazingly skilled at frying food. As far as the tonkatsu, I've only had the hire tonkatsu (pork loin). I don't know how they tenderize the cutlet (or even if they do), but it's incredibly tender without sacrificing texture like marinating can do.   Their ebi katsu are very large black tiger shrimp - we joke they are size U1. The shrimp is also fried to perfection.  Today, a creamy crab croquette was a special. It was full of crab and very creamy, but I don't know how they fried it so perfectly that the insides weren't spilling out everywhere. Like I said, they are fry masters.  But what totally takes it over the top is the self-service katsu sauce. I like tons of sesame seeds ground to a rough paste before dumping their version of Bulldog sauce. The sesame seeds adds an incredibly nutty flavor and texture.   I believe most of the meals come with rice, miso soup, and a gargantuan mound of finely shredded cabbage to make it seem like you're not eating everything to raise your cholesterol and clog arteries. Their rakkyo (pickled scallions) is good as well.  Hands down. Best tonkatsu in town.",

It was not busy at all when I stepped into the restaurant at 8 pm.  There were only two tables occupied with customers.  As usual, I sat at their counter seating area facing the kitchen and their cooking staff.  There were 5 people working in the kitchen.  I looked at their one page menu and decided to order their rosu katsu dinner ($12.00).  On the counter top in front of me was a wooden box filled with condiments.  There was a container full of sesame seeds that you could grind up yourself.  So while I was waiting, I grinded some sesame seeds for my meal. My katsu dinner arrived about 10 minutes later.  It came with miso soup, a small bowl of white rice, a pile of shredded cabbage (I don't believe that they offer free refills as they do in Japan), dipping sauce and 2 pickled scallions.  The katsu was a little on the dry side and it wasn't a very big portion.  The breading was quite crispy though and not greasy.  Would I come here again?  May be, to try their chicken katsu.",

The BF and I ordered agedashi tofu and shishito peppers to start. The tofu was average, but the shishito peppers were perfectly blistered and seasoned with the tiniest sprinkle of salt. It was a brilliantly simple dish. I've had shishito peppers before, but never had they tasted so good.  I had the chicken katsu and ebi katsu combo dinner. It came with breaded chicken and breaded shrimp, cabbage salad, a bowl of perfectly cooked, fluffy white rice, Japanese pickled daikon and miso soup. You would take some sesame seeds from the condiments rack and grind them using your personal mortar and pestle (which I thought was pretty cool.) Everything was delicious and fresh. It felt authentically Japanese--simple, beautiful, fresh, and delicious!",

It's not on the menu but usually written as a special on a board. The chicken katsu has a light crispy breaded outside and juicy inside to it! The chicken is quite lean compared to other places. The katsu comes served on top of a rack so it doesn't get soggy. It isn't oily either. This place reminds me of wako in LA. They're really careful with packing their takeout as well. The katsu curry is all packaged together in the same box with different compartments and after 20min of driving on the freeway, no spills and none of the rice or cutlet touched the curry. They wrap the entire box in plastic and place the cutlet on top of the rice and it doesn't fall... Yes, I'm quite impressed just by that. All in all, this is my go to spot besides curry zen. I prefer this place more though. Portion sizes are smaller than most other places but hey.. Quality over quantity!",

Sure, it's not a large establishment, but what they make lack in space they more than make up in their food.  Absolutely delicious!  If you even have the slightest craving for Tonkatsu, then you must visit this place--I promise you will not be disappointed.  The portion is perfect and the service is equally as good.  Another bonus is there is no loud music or TV's blaring to distract or annoy the patrons.  Come here, have a cold beer and savor in the awesomeness that is Tonkatsu Kiyoshi!  Update to review as of 8/30/2016:  still awesome.  I come back here every time I'm in town and they do not disappoint.  Service is top notch and the good remains to be the absolute best Tonkatsu in the Valley.  Do not pass Go, do not collect $200--go directly to Tonkatsu (heaven) Kiyoshi.    Updated as of 12/12: This place still rocks!!! Service is top notch; the Tonkatsu makes me feel like I'm back in Japan; and the cold beer helps add the icing on the cake.  This is still the \"go to spot\" for any Japanese food living fans, especially those who crave Tonkatsu; but even if you don't, it doesn't matter--you still must come and check it out--it's that good!!!",

The location, service and food was all good but nothing special. I ordered combo plate with pork and 2 pc shrimp katsu that included miso soup, 2 pc daikon and rice (rice was mushy) and I paid for a small side of curry and it all came out to $20.(If I didn't order the curry it would have been around $18). Please don't get me wrong....the food here was good just not worth the price. You can get chicken katsu that also includes miso soup, cucumber sunomono and salad for $8.50 at Soho down the street!!   I say come here and eat to support locals from hawaii. But if you don't want to overpay then just go to  1. Soho down the street and order Chicken Katsu (lunch menu only). 2. Curry Zen (spring mtn) 3. L&L Hawaiian BBQ :)",

All the staff are quick to smile, ask u how everything is, and top up your water. At tonkatsu kiyoshi your served wonderfully fused comfort food in an uplifting environment. Bravo!",

    "text": "They really do have the best katsu in Vegas!  I was surprised I have not been back for a few years now.  Stumbling upon a Groupon finally brought me back and I see myself coming back more often now.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi makes the most tender and meaty on the inside and crunchy on the outside chicken katsu.  I've been to many Hawaiian/Japanese places and nothing is comparable.  The chicken katsu curry ($11) was served with a generous amount of rice, and a side of miso soup and salad.  The curry was excellent with chunks of carrot and potato.  The salmon katsu ($15) was also very good. It comes with a cabbage salad with delicious ponzu dressing, side of pickled onions, and miso soup.  I love that you can customize your own katsu sauce with the provided sesame seeds and katsu sauce at the table.    The melon soda float was good, but for me a one and done kind of thing.   The menu offers appetizers like karaage, shishito peppers, and sliders, which I will have to try on a future visit.  They also have a dessert menu that includes a green tea cheesecake, which I also plan to try next time.  Service was on point here and super friendly.  Staff was attentive and knowledgeable and made great suggestions.  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 55/100",

It's located off the corner behind sporting life bar so not very noticeable from the street but this quaint restaurant was a definite find.   The employees right off the bat were welcoming, friendly, full of smiles and so courteous. Kinda felt home like, we were seated right away and greeted soon after. We went during lunch so there were a good amount of customers.   We enjoyed quite a few dishes. Excuse me for I am not sure of the names they are called on the menu but I'll do my best. We shared a chicken katau meal, which is quite a large portion. We enjoyed the soft shell crab with tgis amazing ponzu sauce, octupus & cucumber salad, fried squid legs and these octopus cream type balls (no clue what it's called). Everything was so good and quite filling. They were all served fresh and hot and quickly too.   Cutest thing is you get to make your own katau sauce. You grind the seseame yourself and then add the sauce. Different right? I like different.   I'll be back for sure!",

No frills place  Service:  excellent!  I drop my chopsticks and they brought me a new one without me even having to ask.  Very attentive  Food:  the menu is simple.  They sell mainly katsu which is what they are known for.  Most dishes come with small miso soup and salad.  #katsu curry- highly recommend.  Katsu crunchy and light.  The sauce with freshly grounded sesame really elevates this dish.  The curry was deep and yummy.  #katsu donburi:  the egg was delish and made just right not over cooked at all.  Only wish was that they added a bit more sauce to the rice.   #melon float:  great pricing at $3.75.  Melon soda was interesting not bad but I wasn't a big fan.   Parking:  free in the large lot  Overall we had a great time. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  Being able to freshly ground the sesame was a nice treat.  Most locals eat here so we were glad to have found it.",

SERVICE Casual, fast and friendly service. Constantly checked for water and wait time for food wasn't bad at all.  FOOD I orderd their chicken katsu plate which came with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage salad. It is little bit over $10 and is a good portion. While you wait for your order, you can grind up the sesame seeds that you can mix in with katsu sauce for that extra touch of flavor.   Juicy and crunchy katsu. Add that sesame seeds you ground up with your heart and soul into their katsu sauce. Dip your katsu in that sauce. Bazinga. Goes amazingly well with their fluffy bowl of white rice. Mmh.  Unlike other places, miso soup here had a lot of flavor. To my surprise, they have one of the best miso soup in town.   CONCLUSION  Reasonable price, good food and friendly service.",

CHICKEN KARAGE: Japanese fried chicken, decent portion for the price ($5) but a little on the dry side. I've had some amazing karage in Vegas and this one fell short of my expectations. I preferred the side salad this is plated with to the actual dish. TAKO SUNOMONO: Octopus and cucumber salad. This was perfect for the hot Vegas day, light and refreshing with a light dressing. BEEF TATAKI: $7 for 9 tiny strips, served on a bed of radish with ponzu sauce. Pretty good flavor, liked the dipping sauce with daikon. Small portion is shareable but barely so. CHICKEN KATSU SLIDERS: Ordered this because I saw another diner eating the across the room and it ended up being my favorite dish. Two fresh Hawaiian rolls with a halved chicken katsu cutlet and a tasty wasabi-infused sauce.    Service was basic. I like that they have iced green tea available as a beverage. Receipt is hand-written list with the total at the bottom, tax was obviously included but not written out, would prefer an itemized receipt. Our total seemed higher than it should have been. I will come back for the katsu donburi, looks to be the best dish.",

    "text": "I definitely recommend everyone to try this place out! Exceptional customer service with delicious menu items will have me coming back for more!   During my visit, we ordered Hire (pork tenderloin) katsu & Ebi fry ($16), Tori (chicken) katsu & Ebi fry ($14), Rosu (thick cut pork loin) katsu ($12), Takoyaki ($5), Deep fried spam musubi ($3.50), and Kaki (oyster) fry ($5). With your yelp check-in, you can either choose between an order of potato salad or seaweed salad for free! We chose to try the potato salad.  All of the katsu dishes were fried to perfection and did not have an overly thick crust. The chicken and pork cutlets were tender and juicy. They have the best katsu I've had in Vegas so far! Other places I've tried tend to overcook their katsu resulting in a dry cutlet. Another nice touch is that you can grind up sesame seed to your liking and mix it with the katsu sauce! The ebi fry tasted great! Large prawns are fried in a light crispy batter resulting in a nice crunch. Two came with the combo plate and was more than enough!  The takoyaki was pretty straight forward. Nothing to rave about, but was good nonetheless.   Four words...DEEP FRIED SPAM MUSUBI. The proportion of spam to rice was well balanced and was great with the crunch from the panko batter.  Everyone at the table loved this appetizer and will be a staple to order on our next visit!     The kaki fry came with three to an order and was nice and juicy.   Overall, I'm glad to have found this place as it will be my go-to when the cravings kick in for katsu!! Keep up the great work :)",

Usually it is more like scramble eggs.  It was sweet and salty. The curry katsu was yummy the lori was think and the curry is mostly sauce don't expect anything else. The fried musubi was a pleasant surprise.  We had it at Da Kitchen and it was not yummy, full of rice.  This one is nicely breaded and deep fried.   The Japanese sausage taste like kielbasa sausage, I can live without this.   You will get the full experience of a katsu house.   Yes that means you'll smell likes fried foods when you leave.",

The tonkatsu is light, juicy, and flavorful. Mix your own sesame/Katsu sauce, put the spicy mustard in for a unique flavor unlike any Katsu sauce out there. The Hire-Katsu meal is perfect for lunch. Paired with either iced matcha(green tea) or oolong(barley) tea, the meal as a whole is so refreshing and not overwhelmingly filling.   And! They have Asahi \"black\"! Which I first tried in Japan for an alternative to Guinness. Since then I've never been able to find it. Will have to come back for dinner.  I'll be back for sure.  (Subarashi oishi) (amazingly delicious)",

    "text": "Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a small family-owned restaurant that can be easily missed if you don't know where it is.  With a handful of tables and a few counter seats, it would be smart to call ahead to check how busy they are.  Weeknights can be pretty busy for them.  We've been fans since the beginning and are happy to support mom and pop shops.    We usually get the Hire Katsu Dinner \"pork tenderloin katsu\" ($13) and the Ebi Fry Katsu Dinner \"black tiger prawn katsu\" ($16).  All the katsu dinners come with rice, miso soup, cabbage slaw, and pickles.  Apparently there are free refills on the rice, soup, and slaw.  Be sure to ask though. I personally love the cabbage slaw since it's refreshing against the heavy katsu sauce.   While you are waiting for your order, you can grind up your toasted sesame seeds into a fine powder with the provided mortal and pestle and mix it into the katsu sauce.  We also add the Agedashi Tofu \"deep fried tofu with dashi sauce\" ($4), the Shishito Peppers \"lightly fried and salted\" ($4.50), the Panko Crusted Soft Shell Crab \"breaded fried soft shell crab\" ($7), the Ika Geso \"fried squid legs\" ($5.50) and/or the Gyoza \"pan fried pork, chicken and vegetable pot stickers\" ($5) to round out the meal for us and the kids.  The Japanese curry dishes are pretty tasty and popular as well.  They have pork and chicken options for that.  One of their newer items that have been getting some attention is the Fried Musubi \"served with teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo\" ($3.50).  I have yet to try it, but musubis are pretty loved in this house.  Some of the desserts we've enjoyed have been the Melon Cream Soda Float and the Yuzu Panna Cotta (which I don't think is available anymore).  Service is great.  Staff is super friendly and it's nice to see the same people working throughout the years.  The owner usually would come by to each table and say hello, but I haven't seen him the last couple of times I went.  We're due for a return visit soon.",

If you've been to L&L or any other Hawaiian joint, you have probably had the tough, greasy, heavy chicken katsu. THAT is not real tonkatsu. It should be light, moist, crispy, and flavorful. That is exactly what you get here. They have different options such as pork, chicken and salmon. They also have curry tonkatsu, which is what I ordered. Omg. It was amazing. The curry was so flavorful and creamy while the pork tonkatsu underneath was light and tender. They also give you a mortar and pestle which I was a bit confused about since the waitress did not explain what it was for, but with a quick glance around the dining room, I realized that it was to crush the sesame seeds for the tonkatsu sauce! It was actually a bit fun to do because honestly, how often do you get to grind sesame seeds?! The katsu sauce was amazing as well.   I seriously crave their tonkatsu every day because it's soooo scrumptious. Their menu isn't very extensive, but it doesn't need to be because you know that every single item is delicious.",

The curry has a touch of sweetness that I like over Curry Zen.  I feel like Curry Zen is more of a traditional Japanese curry versus this curry has some veggies (carrots and potatoes).  I also like that they have the sesame that you can grind for the tonkatsu sauce; I love the smell of fresh ground sesame and the nutty taste it adds to the tangy tonkatsu sauce.  The only thing that I think was missing was some pickled plum to go with the curry.  The location is the old Rice Trax, but they have done a great job of sprucing the place up and I love the little piggy silhouettes they have on the wall.  If you are a curry aficionado....you have to give this place a try!",

It doesn't seem too crazy or out of the ordinary but it adds the uniqueness of dining here.  Their katsu is top knotch, good portions and very tasty. The menu isn't overwhelming and whenever I read it, it's easy to make a decision. Prices are average and actually decent for the quality and portion you receive.  Staff are always welcoming and friendly. My first visit was quite enjoyable. I came here with my girflriend for a nice dinner. We sat at the \"bar(don't think there is alcohol served here)\" and our waiter asked if we've ever ate here. We replied \"no,\" and he showed us what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce. We had a good time, as simple as it was. We had a fun conversation with our waiter too.  Whenever I eat here, I tend to always order the chicken and shrimp katsu. yumm I haven't eaten here in a month or two and the more I think about it right now it makes me hungry.  5/5 for all around good experiences for every visit and great consistent food and service.",

    "text": "For starters, we ordered the Beef Tataki and potato salad. The potato salad was asian style with apples and was ok. I enjoyed the Beef Tataki though! Great appetizer!   I ordered the Chicken Katsu. If Tonkatsu had a really good dressing for their cabbage salad that comes with the katsu... it would be perfect! The ginger dressing doesn't really go well with it. The katsu itself was really GOOD! It reminded me of Wako, a really popular Katsu place in Los Angeles  Service was also awesome! The waiter recommended this tasty melon soda float for dessert. Never had anything like it. Kinda like a root beer float but instead of root beer, its melon soda!",

Can't go wrong with Shishito Peppers to start out your meal.  Starving?  Go for the combination of Hire (perfectly breaded crispy pork breasts) and Shrimp (colossal tiger prawns) Katsu Dinner.  For fifteen bucks, the meal comes with rice, miso soup, salad, and pickled pearl onions... definitely worth it.  Dope how their customers also get to grind their own sesame seeds to add for the sauce.   Got to try Katsu Curry last time I was here.  Flavor wasn't bad but there are better ones elsewhere.  Make sure to get extra ginger on the side if you do end up getting it though.  Overall, Tonkatsu Kyoshi is one of the better katsu houses in the valley.  Seating is quite limited so there could be a wait.  Nonetheless, delicious food and great service.  Can't wait for this restaurant to start serving booze since there's nothing better than eating great katsu with a large glass of ice cold beer!!",

I did not find the food  that extraordinary.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Sando (pork cutlet sandwich) and a side order of Crab and Cucumber Salad.   Although the pork cutlet was crisp on the outside, it was very dry.  The potato salad that came with it was very good.  The Crab and Cucumber Salad should have been renamed Cabbage Salad because the first two ingredients were hardly there.  Portions were filling, but the experience was not fulfilling.

    "text": "This was a great hole-in-the-wall that we found from a co-worker recommendation.  Breaded fried pork cutlet sounds delicious to begin with, but I was not prepared for how well Tonkatsu Kiyoshi executed on the dish and at such value! You get two big pork cutlets with a standard order. They are fork-tender and served on a little rack to prevent sogginess and ensure maximum crispiness! They also offer a combo plate for a couple bucks more which comes with 2 cutlets plus 2 giant crispy, tender shrimp. And did I mention that every main course comes with miso soup and white rice as well? I really enjoyed the tonkatsu & japanese curry, which adds a nice mild spice to the dish.  A unique part of the meal is the grind-you-own sesame seeds for the \"bbq\" sauce. The sesame seeds mellow out the flavor of the sauce, which starts out a bit tangy like A1 + BBQ Sauce + Worcestershire Sauce. As you customize the flavor to your liking, it's fun to have different people at the table all tweak their sauces differently then share and compare.  On a final note, they have a nice selection of appetizers in the $3-6 range and authentic Japanese tea (Asahi beer coming soon!). 2 people, 2 apps, 2 drinks, the 2 biggest entrees, and 2 full & happy customers came to $40. Fast and attentive service and unbelievable food has put this restaurant on my \"must visit\" list. I've already recommended it to everybody that I know!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places we've discovered since moving to Las Vegas. The Katsu Curry is the perfect meal for a chilly day. And Las Vegas has been really chilly lately! It's a generous portion of beautifully fried (Yes, Japanese food can be beautiful even if it's fried. Educate yourself and rent these movies - Jiro Dreams of Sushi, The Ramen Girl, and Tampopo) pork tenderloin with a delicious curry sauce with chunks of potato and carrot over white rice. You also get a bowl of miso soup. It's the perfect hearty meal that will warm you up and leave your tummy so satisfied. If my tummy could talk it would tell me how happy it is. Having traveled to Japan twice and eating my way through the country, I'll vouch that the Katsu Curry is just like in Japan. It's one of those menu items that is so good that you order it every time. One of these days I'll have to force myself to try something else on the menu to mix it up. The service is very nice and the restaurant is very clean and neat. The times we've been there, we noticed Japanese patrons - always a good sign at a Japanese restaurant! They have highchairs for the kiddies. They have Calpico on their beverage menu which is fun. It's a popular Japanese soft drink. Want to finish off your meal with something sweet? Get a scoop of red bean or green tea ice cream for dessert. I LOVE this place and it is a perfect 5 stars for me. For those of you from NYC, I think the Katsu Curry here is way better than at Curry-Ya on East 10th Street.",

Wow!  This place is incredible!!  My wife says its the best Tonkatsu she's ever had.  I would have to agree.  The taste was so clean, if that is any way to describe a deep fried piece of pork.  The panko was super crisp and cooked perfectly.  The oil must be changed frequently too, because the food was simply wonderful!  I mean, good Lord, this was the perfect Katsu.

I've made it a point for years to go here when I'm in town and get the chance, even to order for takeout. The breading and frying I think make the difference between good and truly outstanding katsu, and this place consistently nails it every time I go. The tonkatsu is tender and juicy in the middle, crispy on the outside without being greasy, and when the plates come out its obvious from their appearance they're prepared with a lot of care. I usually get the combination dinner with ebi (fried shrimp) but have enjoyed everything I've gotten so far.   The restaurant is small but tidy and at the end of a quiet strip mall. The owners (at least I think they're the owners) are often there and seem to remember me, even though I wouldn't consider myself quite a regular. Easiest 5-star review I've ever given.",

I have been to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi a number of times since my original visit and am more in love every time I visit.   The batter perfectly coats the meat and it's fried wonderfully. It's so light and moist, I can't get enough. I don't typically love fried food but this place is magic.",

They are a bit more expensive than most curry places, but you can tell they use quality ingredients and the preparation and presentation is consistent.  Ive had the salmon, shrimp, and regular pork katsu with curry and I enjoyed them all. I think I like the pork best though with the tonkatsu sauce.  Dont sleep on the cabbage salad. The dressing it comes with is very good and compliments the heavy fried food well.  Service is also really good, the manager is personable and friendly.",

    "text": "I finally got around to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi when I was on this side of town. It's hard to go to a restaurant that only specializes in one aspect of Japanese cuisine but I really enjoyed the meal. From their specials board we ordered the chicken and corn croquette and fried spam musubi as well as an order of potato salad. I can't say I noticed much chicken in the croquette but the texture of the soft potato and crispy breading was comforting and delicious. I was skeptical of ordering the musubi cuz how much fried food do we really need in a meal but it was AWESOME. Very light breading with aonori seaweed flakes and a spicy mayo dipping sauce. It was really, really good. The potato salad was exactly what I wanted: cool and chunky potatoes with slices of celery and apple..? for added sweetness and crunch.   Not that we needed any more food but I had the chicken katsu and my boyfriend got the katsu curry. The sets come with \"rice, miso soup and pickled vegetables\" which I guess are unlimited but I didn't need any more than I was served. I was a bit disappointed that \"pickled vegetables\" was only a few pickled onions but otherwise the meal was excellent. Make sure to mix the hot mustard with your katsu sauce and sesame seeds. They served a different sauce with my meal that I found tasted a lot like gin.. which was weird. My boyfriend loved the curry and it was a huge portion.   Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a bit of a specialty meal and not something I would crave more than a few times a year but it does katsu very well and the restaurant seems to do a swift business. I also appreciated the pacing of the meal, with dishes being brought out at the right time to enjoy the started before getting the main course. I'll probably find myself traveling across town more often now to explore what the southwest offers.",

I'm not sure what sort of 5-star chef they have in the back whipping up that Chicken Katsu Donburi batter but I was basically in Narnia. Even after my drive home the chicken was still crispy. I must also say that although I'm usually a spam musubi purist, I've been introduced to a while new world with their deep fried variation. That sauce? Don't. Meaning do. It's so good.

Not sure why people are saying this is the best tonkatsu in town.  The serving sizes were LARGE with dishes around 12-17$ depending on you meat choice.  Pork Tonkasu was dry and not seasoned at all. The meat had no seasoning and it def needed salt.  My favorite part is the smashing and grinding the sesame seeds and adding the sauce!!! So much fun, idk why! Guess even as adults we like to play with our food My other concern with the place was the curry consistency. It was kinda watery and not thick and if you look at the photos, the curry has about 2 pieces about potato and 2 pieces of carrots.  Other than that the service was ok, very friendly especially the manager.  Hawaiian music atmosphere!",

After waiting for 20 mins we got seated.  Our waitress was super bubbly and friendly from Taiwan.  I ordered the chicken  katsu curry, and my friends both got the pork katsu curry.  Food came out relatively quickly but because they were busy we had to remind them to get us lemons for our water and bowls to put our sauces in.   The funnest part about this meal is that you get a grinder to grind up your own sesame seeds for the katsu sauce.  You can grind it as coarse or as fine to your tasting.    When my chicken katsu came, I was really disappointed at how small it was, hence the 4 stars.  I wish the chicken cutlet was bigger.  Nonetheless, the fry on my chicken was excellent.  The outside was light and crispy but the chicken was moist and flavorful on the inside.  The curry was basic.  Tastes like the \"golden curry\" you can buy at stores and make at home.  My meal also came with a small salad and miso soup.  Overall I would definitely come back here again if my craving for tonkatsu arises.  I would however order the pork tonkatsu next time because I think the portion is bigger.",

I promise you that you'll never order tonkatsu anywhere else in town after you've tried their fried perfections.   I've introduced this place to a lot of friends, and none of them have said anything negative about this gem of a restaurant. The food is consistently good, the service warm and friendly, and the atmosphere casual and inviting.   The tori katsu dinner is, along with every other dinner plate, is beautifully presented on a tray, consisting of Japanese pickles, miso soup, rice, a healthy heap of chopped cabbage (accompanied by a tasty dressing), and the main event, the tori katsu.   Gosh, I dream about the tori katsu quite often. The texture so perfectly crispy and tender, the taste so savory, contrasted with the sweetness of the tonkatsu sauce with grinded sesame seeds. I'm getting chills just thinking about it.   And it's not just the tori katsu you should try. I would encourage you to try everything. Both tonkatsu plates, the ebi (shrimp) fry. Heck, even the fried spam musubi. It's all good! I try not to eat fried food that often, but when I do, I go to Kiyoshi.",

I love love love the food, just wish they opened back up for lunch... dinner only place.",

We had the katsu don and the pork cutlet curry with shrimp tempura and I would get both again. The cutlet and tempura were both perfectly fried and juicy, and the egg in the katsu don was still slightly runny, which I prefer. The salad dressing was tart, balancing it perfectly with all the fried richness. I also tried the melon float, which I personally wouldn't get again because it was a little sweet for me.",

The food is not oily and greasy, the Hire katsu is perfect and comes with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage with a dressing on the side. The miso soup is the best tasting that I have ever had! I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, fancy ones and simple ayce types!!! None of them compare to this place... As far as the miso soup goes. If you are into Japanese food and love miso soup must try..  Let's move on to the Hire katsu.... Perfect portions and juicy! The breading is perfect and so good. This place has it down to a science. The sesame seed katsu sauce is perfect to compliment.. Don't forget to grind the sesame seeds!  Now let's move on to service... The girl that was servicing us never came back to check on us? Not once, just dropped off the food and left..... Hmmmm strange considering that the only other table in there was sitting at the bar.... The other couple on the side table was just talking and drinking water, they were done eating ages ago!!!!! Bad move I am a 20%. Tipper, not today.........  This is the reason for the 4 stars not five!  With all that said I will continue to eat here as this is the only place in vegas that has Tonkatsu that is worth driving here for!!!!!",

Service was great & our server was great about explaining how to mix some of the food items. For example, they provide you with sesame seeds, a small grind bowl, and katsu sauce and BAM! you end up w/ a fantastic katsu sauce. I went with the traditional katsu chicken, but the menu was full of katsu curries and other seafood items.   If you get the side of Japanese mustard in your meal, which you can add to the katsu sauce, I have to warn you,  put too much and the katsu sauce is too hot. Kind of like wasabi. Some of the plates come as a combo meal, unless you have a hefty appetite or plan on sharing w/someone else, I do not recommend getting the combo plate- its alot of food. The regular plates come w/alot as well. Food was tasteful and unique in style, I will def come again.",

The food came out cold and staggered, the whole table was not plated/swerved within a reasonable gap between.  I went again yesterday and I was very impressed with the pick up with service and the food got a lot better! Salad dressing seemed to be a yuzu (lemony) based, it was fresh, crisp, and clean with finely shopped cabbage salad (the thinner the better IMO!). I got the pork tonkatsu and shrimp combo, super crispy but still moist! Their tonkatsu sauce also improved, it was too sweet before and not it has that little tangy bite to it which is what I love about a good tonkatsu sauce.   I was super pleased with the improvement in service and food, can't wait to go again!",

We went for dinner while they were full and waited for a few minutes for a table to open up. When the table was not busy, we started to walk towards it and a waitress with a rude voice yelled to wait so she could clear the table. Actually we weren't planning on sitting, we just wanted to stand next to the table and wait for the waitress to clean it up. And even if we were about so sit, you should never yell at your customers. It was awful ((( She obviously doesn't know anything about customer service. She would be better working in the kitchen. Very, very disappointed. Will not be back again.",

    "text": "My first experience here was a pick up order. My husband wanted pork katsu. After a few hours at the mall, I was too exhausted to cook. I ordered the pork katsu for him and chicken katsu for myself. The pork and chicken cutlets were perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of crispiness with moist and tender meat. It was a generous portion of meat with rice, salad, and miso soup.   My second time, we decided to dine in with our friends. It was neat to \"make\" your tonkatsu sauce. I'm not sure if I did it right as I never grinded sesame seeds to make tonkatsu sauce before. It turned out good so that's all that mattered to me at that point.  My husband ordered the same dish and I opted for the katsu donburi this time. We ordered the chicken karaage and the panko crusted soft shell crab for appetizers and sampled my friend's beef tataki. Small, tasty portions but sufficient to whet our appetite for our main meal.   I was pretty much satisfied with my donburi. One minor complaint. I noticed I got half the amount of meat as the pork katsu dinner which was the same price. So I thought it was a bit overpriced. It was still good though. I will have to try the curry katsu next time.  The service was just OK both times. Another minor complaint that I like to mention-Our friends had ordered chicken karaage too. I'm not sure why mine came out first when they should come out at the same time. I don't like eating by myself and having hungry people staring at my app where I feel obligated to share.  Lastly, the restaurant is cute, quaint, and small. I wouldn't come here with a large group. Maybe four people max.",

But the katsu was tender and moist on the inside and the Panko was perfectly crisp on the outside",

    "text": "Yelp...you never seem to fail me! Another great food adventure on behalf of yelpers.   Hubs and I both ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich, which comes with a nice side of Japanese potato salad (didn't know there was such a thing), and a bowl of miso soup. Little man (4 y.o.) had the karaage chicken.  Service was fast and nondescript.   Each guest gets a mortar and pestle to grind up sesame seeds for their katsu sauce - gave us something to do while we waited for our food and was a fun activity for little man.  The Tonkatsu sandwiches...huge, tender, and just the right amount of crispness. Japanese potato salad...pretty tasty, coming from someone that doesn't like apples (has small chunks in the potato salad). And yes, weird I'm not a fan of apples.   Good miso soup, nice flavor and didn't seem like it came from instant miso packets; seemed like the same quality you get at sushi restaurants.   Karaage chicken...not as tasty, but this is in comparison to the tasty as heck Tonkatsu. Little man seemed to like it though, basic enough to order for kids. If your little one is a picky eater, just ask that they put the chicken on a separate plate because the order usually comes with a little salad and places the chicken on a bed of cabbage. The actual katsu entree portions looked huge, so next time I'll probably just share an entree with little man. I could barely get thru the sandwich!   We'll be back!!",

We ordered the combination Tori Katsu (chicken) / Ebi (large size panko crusted [prawn size 6\" long & thick] shrimp) dinner and soft shell crab (large size - appetizer) which we shared.  Hands down, Kiyoshi's has the best Katsu we've EVER tasted; it is the BEST !!  Prices are fair for the quality ingredients used and portions served.   My wife is a great cook but she and I were amazed with the light/ crispy texture and moistness of the katsu - EXCELLENT !!   We had the opportunity to speak with Kiyoshi and wife who are 808 connected and very accommodating.   Both of us can't wait for our next trip to taste their curry!    Mahalo Kiyoshi!",

The menu isn't super extensive but it has a little from everything.  The food i ordered was Pork Katsu Curry, Chicken Karaage, and Beef Tataki. The pork katsu was very tender and tasted really good. The curry was decent. Ive had better but it was not bad. The curry also had potatoes and carrots in it. The chicken karaage was not what i expected. Reading the menu i thought it was actual fried chicken. But it was also very tender and the flavor was good. The beef tataki was good but there was only 5 slices of it and it was priced at $5 so that was a little disappointing.  Overall the food was good i would definitely go here again especially since its right by my house.",

Portions were larger on the pork, but the chicken portion was still more than adequate.  The bread crumbs were crisp and the meat was cooked just right (not over or under cooked).  The miso soup was solid and the seaweed salad was perfect (fresh, crunchy, great dressing).  The sesame that you grind on the spot for yourself added a fresh flavor to the excellent tonkatsu sauce.  Great value (under $30 for two for lunch).  Meredith, the owner, was very attentive and really cares about her customers and the food quality.   Try it!",

As soon as we walked in we were greeted and we sat on the table.  The menu size is perfect.  I always get overwhelmed by large menus.  We ordered our food and we started to grind the sesame for our tonkatsu sauce. They should have asked if this was our first time, because I wouldn't have known what to do with the muddle.  Good thing the hubby showed me what to do! We ordered the beef tataki. It was really good, portion was smaller than expected but still good with the ponzu.  We ordered the Japanese potato salad and that was tasty.  The apples gave it a sweet kick! I ordered the salmon and ebi katsu and hubby enjoyed the chicken and ebi katsu.  Everything was perfect.  The breading was crispy and perfect! You have to have good breading for the perfect katsu.  The chicken and shrimp was not overcooked.  It was so soft and moist.  The chicken just melt in your mouth! I also added the hot mustard in the katsu sauce and it gave the sauce a nice hot kick. Yummy! I definitely enjoyed this place and I want to go back for the katsu curry!

This is THE tokatsu place to go to. You can taste the oil is changed out frequently which I appreciate.  The apps are just ok.  I'd say just stick with the tonkatsu since it really is the star.  The shredded cabbage with the tangy dressing is a nice compliment to the fried meat and carb-y rice.   Love that you can make your own dipping sauce.  It's also good entertainment (and may help build your appetite) while waiting for food to come out.  Order the melon float after if you have room to spare.  Kind of reminds me of a Melona bar - not too sweet or heavy.   The restaurant is always clean and service is always nice.  Sometimes a tad slow but it's ok - it's a small family run place!  Just relax and enjoy.   Thank you for having such a limited menu but executing so well. (beats those restaurants that have a million things on the menu but nothing tastes good)  Also thanks for great ventilation. None of that \"stinky Chinese food place\" smell on your clothes when you leave.   Make the trip if you haven't yet - who can pass up deliciously fried meat?!?",

I have been here multiple times since they have opened and each time I enjoy something a little different.  I have had Curry Katsu, which is nice portion of steam white rice, curry sauce, and of course the pork tenderloin Katsu. It is always cooked perfectly and the portions are large.  I have also had the Salmon and Shrimp Katsu, Chicken Katsu, and Thick cut pork Katsu. All done and cooked masterfully with the right amount of crispiness on the outside and juiciness still retained in the meat.  The appetizers also very delectable and not too over sized, which I personally like. Need I say more about this place and its food. Moving onto the service, service here is always fast, friendly, they strive to make you feel welcome and its a very laid back and cozy place.  5/5 - Arnold",

Drinks came to the table right away to cool down sweat from the las vegas heat. We questioned the server about the mortar and pestel. He showed us how to grind sesame to use for our katsu sauce. Our chicken cutlets came out huge. The plate had more rice than your body will allow you to eat. the curry was pretty delicious and had big chunks of potato and carrots. Tho they dont do my favorite add ons like corn, spinach, or cheese like Zen Curry. All plates also come with a miso soup to wash everything down. I would definitlly come back again with more friends.",

There was nothing particularly bad about the whole experience of eating here, but nothing that stood out as \"outstanding.\" I have gone to a Tonkatsu specialty place before in LA which was more expensive but also more tasty and a better experience.  I got the standard pork tonkatsu dinner. The portions were generous and the cut of the pork was quite thick. It came with two cutlets which was more than enough meat. On the critical side, their tonkatsu sauce is quite salty and it would be tough to counter that with the options on the table. The cutlets themselves were moist and well cooked, though the breading was a little plain in flavor.  The dinner portion came with rice and miso soup, which were ok but decent.  One thing that felt awkward to me is that the store was eerily quiet despite there being about a dozen people there when we got there. The place is quite small and cozy, but I for some reason felt like I was in a library the whole time.",

She was about to seat me at one of the free tables in the front and asked how many were in my party. I told her it was just me and she suddenly had a party of 10(!) coming in and refused to seat me. This is not exactly the type of restaurant one makes a reservation at, not to mention there were only 8 free chairs left in the entire place. Something sure stinks, and in my opinion it smells a little like RACISM.  I will be telling everyone I know NEVER to patronize this establishment.  ---   Since it looks like Yelp doesn't post responses to responses on the review page, I wish to point out that every single website I've been able to find listing this restaurant, including yelp itself, indicates that the restaurant does not accept reservations. This is as of 11/16/16. Be sure that this will now magically change in order to fit the story Meredith has put forward about a 7pm reservation.   I think the ownership needs to take a good look at the reviews for their business. There are several on here that note one of the employees yelling across the restaurant at customers. Additionally, I don't appreciate the lie about not being able to hear. You asked me straight to my face how many were in my party and then when I said it was just me, which you seemed to hear just fine, you told me oh we have a reservation for 10 coming in. Why would you ask me how many were in my party at all if you weren't planning to seat me? Where were the other 2 patrons in the party of 10 going to sit? There were only 8 free chairs in the entire restaurant - trust me I looked around and counted seats when you told me there was a party of 10 coming into a 25 seat restaurant. This is about as ridiculous as making a reservation at the L&L or Grand Sign Kitchen, 2 of your local competitors.",

Being the only specialty katsu I know of in the valley, it definitely does not disappoint. One bite of their katsu and you can immediately tell the difference in terms of theirs, and any other katsu meal you can find in a Japanese themed restaurant.  My go to meal is the classic Chicken Katsu. I sincerely believe that the get the krispiness spot on, as well as the texture of the chicken. I love how it's such a big meal too, as it definitely makes you feel like you've spent your money's worth. Every meal comes with appetizers such as miso soup, cabbage or salad depending on your meal, and a side of rice. I also recommend their donburi. It's one of the better ones I've had in the city.  One of the things that makes this place so great is the authenticity of your experience. One step into this place, and you can immediately tell its Japanese. A lot of people may say that this place is small and cramped, but if you have ever been to Japan, all the shops there give exactly this small, cozy and whole in the wall kind of vibe. Their decorations are also very oriental. You can also make your own katsu sauce by grinding the sesame seeds yourself. That makes a nice, fun addition that gives you something to do as you wait for your meal.",

It's kind of in the middle of no where, compared to the busy street of Spring Mountain.   Cute little restaurant! It seemed like a family-owned business. The ambiance is definitely on the casual side, but they have great food. The portion sizes were on point, and the Katsu was crispy on the outside, yet tender in the inside. The sauce was on the sweeter side, and since I'm used to the traditional Japanese tonkatsu sauce, which is more savory, adapting to that sweet sauce on fried pork was kind of weird. It was more on the Hawaiian side more than Japanese, but it was still very delicious!",

The food is probably better than some competitive Tonkatsu senmon restaurants (professional Tonkatsu restaurant) in Tokyo.    The Rotsu is done perfectly each visit. At the bite of the pork tenderloin, the crispy crunch accompanied by juicy meat without any sense of greasiness.  It is done in perfection.    I often add a side order of curry to go with my meal.  It's a perfect meal for me. Hope you'll enjoy it too.  I haven't been able to find anything bad to say but praises and applauses.",

Essentially, the restaurant specializes in katsu (Japanese-style fried meat cutlets), but the fun part is that you get to grind your own sesame seeds to make the sauce. You can get free refills of cabbage.  The food itself was tasty, though menu is a bit limited. Prices fair. Service was good, and I am pretty sure some of the employees/owners are Taiwanese based on the accent of their Mandarin.  The interior was cute and clean.   The sad part is that they are only open for dinner!",

Expect a wait, but there isn't really a waiting area meaning you wait outside or stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant. Staff are consistently very friendly.   The menu is small but excellent. We tried the chicken karage to start. Excellent! High quality meat instead of that weird grey and slimy meat some places use for karage. I highly recommend the katsu. Perfectly breaded and fried without being greasy or oily. The meat is incredibly tender. Check-in on Yelp for a free potato salad (Japanese style and very good). You grind your own sesame seeds to add to the katsu sauce just like at Saboten in Asia!  Small negative that instead of fountain drinks they only have soda in cans.  Their curry is not breathtaking and tasted basically like a packaged curry, but I can forgive this given their excellent katsu.",

Best thing is the thick cut pork loin but if you want chicken, shrimp, or regular that is good too. The katsu sando is very good with the bread being similar to how it is in japan/hawaii.

First thoughts that come to mind: Authentic! I've been to Japan before, and Katsu or fried foods are very common. Even just the idea of grinding your own sesame seeds for the sauce, gave such a fresh and authentic feel. I had the chicken and shrimp combo, the potato salad, corn and chicken croquette, miso soup, rice, cabbage, cold tofu and iced tea. Next time I'l get the cucumber salad because it's nice to have a cold or light dish with the hot fried components. This was a delicious and filling meal! I was able to take some home to-go also. The server Meredith was very helpful, personal and friendly. I'm definitely going to come back and I can't wait to try the other items!",

The meat amount is large enough to share. The meat tasted fresh and nice side dishes and Soup for the meal combo. Then the fun part of making your own sauce, yummy and fun together.

Experience:  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi has a kitschy, homestyle vibe to the restaurant. The jazz music in the air and the minimalistic Japanese art that is displayed amongst the walls give the entire experience a relaxing feeling. The customer base here is also very quiet and to themselves. The delectable aroma that wafts throughout the air reminds me a lot of my family's home-cooking as well. I love the ambience of this restaurant. It's fantastic. I always go here to relax and unwind after a long day.  Customer Service: The customer service here is fantastic as well. The waitress that always takes my party's order is very attentive, kind, and informed about the menu. When a member of my party did not know what to order, she immediately recommended the most popular items and the best entry dishes for newcomers. Whenever I needed a refill of water, the waitress I had was always determined to immediately refill my beverage without being asked to. Fantastic service!  Food: Of course, the food here is out of this world. This is my favorite Japanese cutlet restaurant in Las Vegas. This place is an absolute gem. I always order the Hire Katsu Curry and I accompany this main order with the Fried Spam Musubi. The presentation of the dishes here are great as well, I'm always awestruck at the attention to detail and how evenly dispersed the food is on the plate.   Overall: I highly recommend this place. Even if you're a complete newcomer to curry in general, the staff here always ensures to explain how to properly flavor your food to your liking. The wait time will not disappoint, and the prices are fair per serving!",

Good food takes time and it's worth every second.   The food is prepared with care and I've never seen a place with such consistent frying in my life. The meat is done without a single hint of grease left over, crispy outside with juicy pork inside dipped in the hand ground sesame tonkatsu sauce is perfection.  Don't bring a large group, 6 4-seat tables and counter seating is perfect for this place. Any bigger and it just wouldn't have the same feeling.   This is a weekly spot for me now despite being across town, 100% worth the drive.",

The Hire Katsu Curry is perfect for when you want something to warm you up. The curry has the perfect blend of spices that won't overwhelm you. It's great just with rice, which is saying a lot. The katsu is cooked perfectly and is very flavorful.   The Katsu Donburi is also delicious. The sweet egg pairs well with the saltiness of the katsu. It is very filling and rich.   My bf swears by the Tori Katsu. The cabbage that is served with it provides a refreshing bite so you don't get tired of the pork.   All the dishes come with sides of salad and miso soup. You're able to grind sesame seeds at your table to make a customizable sauce. The decor and service, along with the delicious food, provide an authentic Japanese atmosphere that makes me want to return again and again.",

I was craving Tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) when a friend mentioned this little joint.  When I first walked in I noticed it was small with about 6 tables and a bar that could seat about 6. Small but comfy and homey with almost every seat filled. Hite Katsu is the staple and it was about 13$ but you get a hearty meal. Comes with a bowl or rice, side dish of miso soup, but handful of shredded cabbage and pickled garlic. Another cool note is the way they handle the katsu sauce. They give you sesame seed and you grind how much you want and mix it with the katsu sauce. It makes it have a smooth taste.  Was too full to try their desserts but next time I want to get their matcha cheesecake! Friendly staff and owner was also a great plus",

Although I've never eaten inside the restaurant, their food is always yummy! Pretty simple menu... they specialize in Curry and Katsu dishes. If you don't really like curry, then try their Katsu dishes; they are served with katsu sauce instead.  When I get tired of eating chicken, I will get the Salmon Katsu or the Hire Katsu to switch it up. I enjoy the shredded cabbage that comes with the Katsu dishes, along with the pickled scallion and dollop of mustard. If I'm really hungry, I'll add an order of gyoza and shishito peppers! Everything is so delicious when eaten all together!",

This followed delicious Edaname, a awesome Crab Cucumber Salad and a delightful little fried pepper appetizer. The Katsu platter arrived to our amazement it was BEAUTIFUL and the shrimp were amazing! Very fresh and not greasy plus the fresh cabbage accompaniment with steamed rice and pickled scallions were refreshing and unique. Katsu is a hand breaded choice of pork (the specialty), chicken or shrimp. I forgot to mention it also arrived with a phenomenal miso soup that if a fan this one rocked! Excellent service and a delightful owner,Mark, with years in hospitality makes this neighborhood restaurant my top Vegas choice to date! We are huge foodies and visit for 1-2 weeks each year- value $25 for everything mentioned with bottled water and quality make this restaurant a real winner!",

    "text": "Wow--this place is the real deal!!  We decided to go and check this place out during our vacation in Vegas (we're from Honolulu, HI) when I saw all the awesome reviews on Yelp and the pictures of what appeared to be authentic Japanese-style tonkatsu!  What makes it look authentic, you say? Well, they use the little wire strainers on the plate under the katsu to keep the food from soaking in any excess oil that may remain after frying, keeping the katsu crunchy and tasty!  After studying the menu, noticing how reasonable the prices were for authentic katsu and getting a thumbs up from my wife, we went for lunch.  Upon arriving, we figured the place must have opened recently, since it still had a huge \"NOW OPEN!\" banner hanging above the restaurant 's name over the front door.  We entered and saw it was not a very large place--maybe six tables that can seat 4-6 each and a counter that can serve another six customers.  It was, however, very clean and authentic looking with the lacquer dishes, numerous decorations and Japanese kanji characters abound.  A large man behind the counter greeted us with the familiar Japanese welcome phrase, \"Irashaimase!\"  After grabbing a few items, he then made his way to our table, served us some ice water and handed us menus. My wife ordered the chicken and shrimp katsu combination dinner, while I chose to have the beef tataki appetizer and hire katsu dinner.  After placing the order with the kitchen, he came back and showed us how to make our own katsu sauce by grinding up the sesame seeds in the special grinding bowl using a wooden stick, which we already knew how to do because we experienced it in Japan two years ago.  After making our katsu sauce, the beef tataki arrived, and man was it delicious!  Well-marbled beef is seared slightly on the outside, thinly sliced then served rare on a bed of finely grated daikon and a shiso leaf, accompanied with ponzu sauce for dipping--I was in beef-lovers heaven!  While enjoying my appetizer, we found out that our server was none other than owner Kiyoshi, who learned the ropes about tonkatsu and Japanese cuisine from his grandmother while he was growing up in Japan as a boy.  He had also gained invaluable experience about Las Vegas and the food scene there through his nine years of experience working at Bellagio, but decided a few years ago he wanted to branch out and own his own place.  After some discussion with his investment partners, they decided to open Tonkatsu Kiyoshi in November, 2013 at its present location, and he said he is pleased with how things are going for the restaurant for the six months since.  A few moments later, our dinners (lunches?) arrived, and they were fantastic!  Each dinner was accompanied with miso soup, savory and full of pieces of tofu and seaweed--warm and delicious!  Also served with our dinner was a hot bowl of white rice, shredded cabbage and rakkyo--little pickled onions that are tart and lip-smacking yummy!  The cabbage was accompanied with an oriental salad dressing, while my wife's shrimp katsu also had a separate sauce.  The tonkatsu I ordered was awesome--the panko crust nicely browned, not at all oily and nicely crisp, and it paired really well with the katsu sauce we concocted earlier.  My wife's shrimp katsu was crunchy, tasty, made with very fresh shrimp and also paired well with the special sauce Kiyoshi brought for it.  Her chicken katsu was tender and moist, not firm like the tonkatsu I was having, but just as delicious.  I am already home in Honolulu now, but drooling just thinking about our wonderful katsu meal at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi and very much looking forward to visiting there again next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

Ever since we told the server about that particular dish being a little too salty, he stopped coming over to our table. We asked for extra plain noodle on the side to offset the saltiness and I had no problem paying extra for it but man..  Given the circumstance, the entire time we were being as polite as possible, the attitude we received from the server was unacceptable. He never once was apologetic, he ignored our table for the rest of our meal, and made us feel very uncomfortable (staring at us but never approaching the table).",

We ended up giving him portions of our chicken so he could eat in the meanwhile. Then a few mins later the server now tells us that their rice cooker is not working...well great fucking timing!! Our whole lunch mood got thrown off. The server offers other options but we just wanted to get the fuck out of there. We paid and got out of there and ended up at zen curry for my son's lunch. This used to be one of my favorite joints but i'm not going back here. Fuck this shit...",

The katsudon and the japanese katsu curry is even better. The prices are also very reasonable. Being able to make your own katsu sauce is something i haven't done anywhere else. Definitely will be coming back to this place over and over. If they ever add a tv, and get their liquor license, I might be there every night!",

    "text": "I came here a few times, but definitely will not be back because of my last two experiences.  I called in a phone order and the girl who answered the phone was extremely rude. She made me feel like I was bothering her. After taking my order, she did not thank me or even say good bye. She simply hung up on me. I was so upset that I ended up not picking up my order. Foolishly I thought maybe she was having a bad day, and decided to give this place another chance. We went for dinner while they were full and waited a few minutes for a table to open up. Once a table left, we started to walk towards it and the same waitress (I recognized her voice) yelled \"Can you wait so I can clear the table\" from across the restaurant (while rolling her eyes). We weren't planning on sitting, we just wanted to stand next to it in case another party walked in. And even if we were about to sit, you should NEVER yell at your customers, let alone from across the room. I believe this is a small family-runned restaurant and maybe she's just there because of her family, but she should probably be working in the kitchen instead of with customers. She obviously doesn't know anything about customer service or perhaps just doesn't care. She seemed irritable as I observed her dealing with other tables as weIl. I find it disappointing that the owner is ok with her treating customers so poorly. He obviously does not care about his restaurant or surviving in this competitive town, which is sad because I love supporting small businesses. I can honestly say I've never been so upset about restaurant service in my entire life.  As for the food- overpriced. Especially the apps. Rice is usually mushy. You can get better elsewhere.",

    "text": "The tonkatsu here is so fresh and crispy!  It reminds me of the famous tonkatsu restaurant in Waikiki, Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin.  This restaurant just opened up 3 weeks ago and I have already been here 3 times... I think I like this place.  The owner Mark and his family run the restaurant.  He is from Japan originally but lived in HI before moving here to Vegas.  He is super nice and remembers me every time I come in.  I have had a chance to try a lot of their menu over the past 3 visits.  Appetizers:  The 2 most popular ones are the chicken karaage and the beef tataki.  The chicken is really good served with the lemon.  Beef comes with a ponzu sauce and tons of onions!  Yum.  Entrees:  The Hire katsu is a classic pork katsu that is juicy and not dried out like a lot of the pork katsu's I've had before.  Simple and delicious.  The Katsu curry is nice because it is the same pork as the Hire katsu but served with Japanese curry and veggies on the side.  It gives you the option to use the curry sauce or the tonkatsu sauce to dip your meat in.  The Katsu-don is a bowl of pork katsu and rice served with an egg cooked on top of it with onions and a soupy sauce.  I preferred the other two dishes more because the cripsy crust is slightly soggier with the egg and onions on top.  The salmon and shrimp katsu is a nice option if you want to mix things up.  I have never had salmon katsu before!    Dessert:  I have only tried the melon floats but they are delicious!  Green melon soda with ice cream!  The funnest part about this place is that you get to make your own tonkatsu sauce... sorta.  You use the little mortar and pestle to grind your sesame seeds and then you mix the seeds with the tonkatsu sauce.  Their sauce is soooo good!   I think it is the best tonkatsu sauce I have had.  See you guys next week :)",

    "text": "Tonkatsu is a Japanese comfort food commonly prepared at home.  In its simplest preparation, a piece of pork loin is tenderized and the flattened pork is breaded and deep fried until cooked.  It is traditionally served with a tonkatsu sauce, but it is jut as common served with Japanese curry and rice.  However you eat it, a good tonkatsu meal will fill your belly and bring a smile to your face.  At Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, the same Japanese tonkatsu is wonderfully prepared and served here.  And like many of the specialty tonkatsu restaurants in Japan and much of Asia, they offer a variety of different preparations (although the selections overseas is significantly greater than what is available here).  The tonkatsu I have tried thus far have all been fried perfectly, where the pork is still cooked but nice, tender and juicy inside.  It is so flavorful that you don't even really need the tonkatsu sauce (you can customize it by grinding toasted sesame seeds and mix it in with their pre-made tonkatsu sauce).  The portions are good for the price.  On my first visit, i tried their Tonkatsu Donburi. Which is just tonkatsu served over rice in the style of a traditional Oyako Donburi (Mother Daughter Rice Bowl or something like that, because they kinkily served the chicken with the egg. Get it ;P).  It was very good!  One of the things I wish is available is the choice of breading for the tonkatsu.  In Japan and in Taiwan, where I ave visited everything from high end premium tonkatsu restaurants to very good fast food tonkatsu chains, they all have more options than what is available as is on the menu.  It is not a huge thing, but sometimes a little more choices make the customer just that much happier.  The miso soup was excellent too, even though that is never the reason for me to ever go to any restaurant.  For what is available in the area, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is unquestionably the best. (Voicing the same sentiment as Philip T in case it is less obvious in this paraphrasing).  3.75 rounded up to the nearest whole integer equals 4.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  If someone opens up a tonkatsu restaurant in Japan, the owner is convinced that their tonkatsu is fucking awesome and the best around.  While there's certainly no market for upscale $30+ tonkatsu meals on the corner of Jones and Robindale, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does a decent job of breading, frying and serving meat.  They're definitely the best around...since they're the only place around!!  My wife got the hire (pork) katsu dinner which was better than the ebi (shrimp) katsu.  The shrimp was quite large which was a plus.  I went with the ebi just to have a variety but I should have just gotten the other pork option (Rosu).  After all, there's a pig on the freakin sign so that should give you some hints on what to order.  The meal comes with miso soup, rice and a little onion.    After you grind the sesame seeds, transfer the amount you'd like into the black dish with the sauce, don't put the sauce directly into the grinding bowl.  That's the wrong way to do it and you limit the size of the piece you dip by using the small bowl.  I noticed several people doing this while we were there.      The quality of their pork is better than Japanese Curry Zen and they give a substantial amount more.  I plan on trying the katsu curry next time for sure and I'll be ready to bump it up a star or two if the curry is great.",

    "text": "mmmm mmmm The breading/crust on the katsu here is a winner for sure~!!! Light, crispy, not oily & DELISH.  The restaurant is made up of like 6 tables and a countertop for solo diners.  You get seated, grind yourself some sesame seeds using the mortar and pestle provided and create your own katsu sauce.. Cool idea but the germaphobe in me got a little creeped out by all the possible sharing of germs that happens during this process since you spoon out the seeds/sauce rather than shake/squeeze out.. Also, do you put the pestle back in its place after using or give it to the server to wash?!?!?  LOL ok enough with the mortar and pestle ;ppp  -Chicken Katsu ($9) Comes with miso soup, pickled pearl onions, rice, salad & 2 chicken katsu breasts. The chicken katsu was juicy and tender and like I mentioned before the breading was on point. The shredded cabbage salad comes with ponzu dressing which was ok but fills you up without eating the rice.  -Chicken Katsu with Curry ($12) Comes with miso soup, pickled ginger, rice, 1 chicken katsu breast and curry. The curry has some potatoes and carrots but tastes like something out of a box. I say skip the Katsu Curry plate and just get the Katsu plate because you get more katsu, you get salad & it's cheaper!!!   Service was friendly. Food took about 10 minutes to come out. I wish they had some zaru soba or udon on their menu & oops I forgot to ask if they have brown rice!",

The mortar and pestle to grind the sesame seeds sets the tone as the nutty smell is intoxicating. You pour the donkatsu sauce over the ground seeds and dip each bite into the mixture. The katsu sauce is sweet like a plumb but not overpowering. A small side salad and bowl of Miso soup comes with the meal. The Katsu is presliced but not too thick where you can't bit a piece into half or thirds to enjoy! My son inhaled his so I know he enjoyed it. I am not a huge rice eater but the fried egg, seaweed and katsu mixed together was a good bite. Overall I would give this a a good rating with service, cleanliness and atmosphere combined. When I am in the mood for donkatsu this will be the place.",

So last night, I finally got off my lazy butt and headed out to try this place.  The inside was bigger than I thought. It was pretty spacious and there was a bar area for people dining alone. On the table is a jar of sesame seeds and a jar of katsu sauce. The server then gave us a tiny mortar and pestle that you use to grind the seeds. You can add this later on to the katsu sauce. That was an interesting experience for sure!   So we ordered the gyoza to start. I had the Pork Curry Katsu and my boyfriend had the Chicken Katsu. Both of the katsus were delicious. They cooked it crispy on the outside while the meat remain moist. I hate dry katsu so they really hit it spot on at this place. What I think made them stood out the most from other Japanese places is their Katsu sauce. It is delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much that I even dipped my pork katsu more on that sauce rather than the curry sauce that it came with.  I highly recommend this place. I love their matcha green tea too. It was perfect.",

    "text": "Ey yo guys, real talk, this place is GAF! They know how to make their katsu hands down. I went with my mom to try this place out because my mom is always down to eat Korean or Japanese food with me, so why not right? I heard about this place from some other yelpers and I was not disappointed!   One thing I saw pictures of was grinding your own sesame seeds and putting in your sauce or something, so I was curious. What you do is grab a bowl, put in some sesame seeds, and you grind it yourself! You can grind it to the consistency of your desire and I thought this was a fun little activity to do while we waited for our food.   I ordered some karaage with my mom, and surprisingly, it was not greasy or too oily, it was actually really good. The outside was really crispy and the inside was soft. This is a highly recommended appetizer! When our actual entrees came out, it comes with the meat you ordered, rice, soup, and a salad. I ordered the pork and I don't remember the name of it because there were two pork katsu items with different names... But they are the same thing, that's what the server told me. I was confused and so I ended up getting whatever that was. My mom got the chicken and my mom got double the meat I did it seemed, for a dollar less. Nothing to complain about there, just get the chicken next time! Like saw their combos, but from the pictures, I didn't think the extra piece of shrimp was worth the 5 bucks, so I passed.   The food was amazing my gosh! The breading was so crispy and the meet was tender and juicy. This is definitely the place to get your katsu fix! You might miss the turn though because it's not in a big plaza, but if your food is good, people will find it, and you will find those people.   Give this place a visit!",

Being part Japanese and given that I go back to Japan once or twice a year, I'm a snob when it comes to Sushi and Tonkatsu (among other things). Now that being out of the way, this place actually does the job for me. Quite good. Food comes out quickly, service is friendly, and I feel my insatiable hunger for Tonkatsu eased after coming here.",

My boyfriend and I just introduced our friend to this place the other night. They are still excellent and still friendly. We have brought my parents here and they love it. My mom especially likes the shredded cabbage...it's very authentic and she enjoys that when we are able to go to Japan.   When we visited, the special was ika geso, so we tried it and I loved it. We also got karaage chicken and takoyaki. Both were winners. I stuck with just the hire katsu this time. I usually get the shrimp and hire katsu combo but for some reason I wasn't feeling shrimp. My boyfriend and our friend got the shrimp and hire katsu combo and enjoyed it very much. I treated myself to a melon soda float, which for most people is probably a weird thing. I picked up my like for the bright green drink while living in Japan, but those who like melon soda should definitely give it a try.",

I got the katsu curry, and my other friends got the takoyaki, katsu donburi and salmon fry and ebi fry katsu dinner.   The prices were reasonable for the large portions and quality of the food, but it would nice to get a little more meat in the lunch specials. The katsu breading was crisp and thick, but still light, and is delicious no matter if you dip it in the curry or the tonkatsu sauce (I could drink this stuff honestly, don't skip out on it), and the rice is perfectly cooked. I loved the melon cream soda float, it was super refreshing and perfect with the heavy curry.   Service was extremely friendly, despite the fact that our party consisted of 6 teenage girls who all wanted separate checks, some paying with card and some with cash. The only thing stopping this place from being five stars was the wait for food, but I'm not going to blame them for it- the food was great and the place was packed.",

The meal I had came with two chicken katsu filets, shredded cabbage with a zesty dressing to contrast the heavier components, a pickled small onion? Was not sure but good, miso soup, and rice.  Also they have these special bowls you grind  seseme seeds in, and then add what I believe is hoison to create a very yummy dipping sauce.  Even though I was eating a main entree that was fried it didn't feel overly greasy or leave me feeling gross and heavy afterwards.  You can tell they cook with love.  I also had the beef tataki which I enjoyed as well.  My boyfriend had one of their bowls which had a great blend of flavors and textures.  I highly recommend you give them a try!",

    "text": "Wanted to check this place from a friend's recommendation. I checked yelp and the photos, reviews, and menu items they had and saw a lot of varieties in their choices. When we entered, my boyfriend and I were kindly greeted by the hostess/waitress and she was welcoming to let us pick our table because I didn't wanna sit near the fan. Being my first time here, I thought the place was simple in decor with framed photos and artwork, and reminded me of small shops & restaurants in Japan. Very nice, cozy, and cute restaurant with kind service. The waitress there were attentive always making sure we got everything we needed, even though they got a bit busier once we sat down.   The Sesame Dipping Sauce  I went with my friends who have already tried this place a few times and showed me how to make our own sesame dipping sauce. The waitress brings out two small bowls and a larger one with two wooden pestle to grind our sesame seeds. In the middle of the table already placed, was a tray filled with seasonings, and one bowl filled with sesame seeds and another bowl filled with what I tasted as a tangy hoisin sauce. So for newbies, you basically get a small scoop of the sesame seed into your provided bowl and start grinding it until its minced and powdery like, then you add a small scoop of the sauce and mix until even. I really like places that allow you to play with and/or cook your food. Now on to the food.  Hiro Katsu Cutlet Dinner  So I got the pork cutlet with a free side of potato salad after checking in on Yelp. (TIP: The check in deal is only good as 1 per table, not 1 per person, btw.) Once my dish came out, I was not expecting it to look so beautiful and orderly arranged. I definitely felt I was back in Japan where the meals were decorated and placed with such detail and precision. The entire arrangement was big and consisted of miso soup, a bowl of rice, a small plate of 2 pickled veggie (looks like pearl onions), a handful portion of shredded cabbage with a small dollop of wasabi, and the main entree: the pork cutlet! The pork katsu was a lot! Very good portion and fried perfectly. Very crispy on the outside and still juicy and tender pork cutlet on the inside. I was surprised how it wasn't oily and I thought it must be from it being placed on a wired rack that it presents with the dish. It also came with a tangy vinaigrette that you can either drizzle on top of the cabbage or using for dipping. I liked dipping the cutlet into either of the sauces. Whichever floats your boat. Overall, the flavors worked well together starting with the warm miso soup and then the crunchy cabbage with the crispy juicy pork dipped with the aromatic sesame sauce. For the price of $13 I thought it was a good deal. It definitely filled me up and I couldn't finish the pork cutlet having about 4 pieces left over.   Ebi Katsu I also got a to go side order of 4 ebi (black tiger prawn) katsu for $18 and they looked pretty big. The taste was good and again crispy on the outside and the prawns were still juicy and sweet. However, there was a lot more batter around the shrimp compared to the pork I had which kinda mislead you to believe how big the prawn might be and it's a tiny bit pricey for 4 of them, but the quality was definitely there, so I didn't mind paying for it.  Overall, I will come back here again and try their other dishes. Definitely come here if you want to eat some authentic well cooked and prepared japanese katsu. ^_^",

It's a small place with about a capacity of 30 or so pax.   My family enjoyed the Fried spam musubi as an appetizer but if you don't want to share, it can serve as a meal. At $3.50, it's a steal! One order consists of 2 musubis, deep fried and cut in half.  Prices are affordable at $10 for Tori Katsu Dinner Chicken (cutlet) katsu, $15 for Hire Katsu Dinner (Pork tenderloin Katsu) and $15 for Ebi Fry Katsu Dinner (Black tiger prawn katsu) Salmon Fry Katsu Dinner (Salmon Katsu). The meals come with soup, rice and salad.   Tip: At the beginning of the meal, you are given sesame seeds to smash so you can add to the Katsu sauce. The kids love it and keeps them busy. It adds that extra taste to the sauce!",

They offer three cutlets including pork, thick pork, and chicken. I opted for the classic pork. Each set comes with cabbage salad, miso soup, and rice! Make sure you check in for some really good asian potato salad! The katsu portions are HUGE! They give you two big pieces per plate. Also I noticed the miso soup, rice, and salad are refillable which is a nice touch! The pork was tender and juicy, not dry at all. Also, I think they have some sort of special seasoning in the bread in that makes it extra good. Our food was slow to come out, but I believe it's because they fry everything to order. Service was incredibly kind and attentive!  This is probably one of the best Japanese katsu in Las Vegas!! Please skip the other Hawaiian joints and come here.",

Its consistent quality of taste and service is what keeps us coming back.   The Japanese potato salad is not to be missed, as well as the fried spam musubi (if you're a fan of that that is) They also offer fried oysters, takoyaki and soft shell crab as appetizers among others. Part of the fun is making your own Katsu sauce, first you grind your sesame seeds then add the sauce and you're set.   Hire Katsu (pork) and Ebi (shrimp) combo $16 is all you need to know. It comes with miso soup, rice, cabbage and pickled onions. Sooooo good! They also have chicken katsu as well as salmon. We've also had their curry which is just as delicious. It's umami at its best.  I could go on and on of how good this place is but why not just get your booties and try it for yourselves. Price is so affordable for the quality you get, Enjoy! Ohhhh and you know it's legit when you see Japanese grandmas/grandpas eating here lol.",

Meat was so tender and absolutely delicious. I'll probably get the curry on my next visit just to try it. I'm excited already lol   Staff are very polite and attentive. This place is not that big so I highly suggest calling ahead for big groups, that is if they take reservations. We came here for dinner on a Monday night and we got seated right away.  I have yet to try their desserts on my next visit as well. We were too full.   Lastly, if you check in on yelp, you get that yummy potato salad for free.",

Located in a small strip mall, parking wasn't hard to find.   I loved that you are given sesame seeds to crush with your own individual mortars and the nuttiness is added to your katsu sauce!  It adds such depth to your dipping sauce.   Their spin on spam musubi with the fried seaweed was unique- my husband really enjoyed this dish evidenced by him eating most of it.  The shishito peppers were perfectly flash fried, topped with bonito flakes.   Our main meal of chicken katsu wasn't oily, crunchy and the meat was juicy and not dry. I ate everything on my plate. I know I was eating fried foods and I appreciate their frying oil tasted clean. I would definitely come back here again. I'm glad I read the positive yelp reviews and trusted my fellow helpers to lead me to finding good tonkatsu in the Las Vegas area.",

Although there were no adjustment for the spicy level of the curry, it was still very flavorful and tasty. Unlike the other curry place I've tried, they have pieces of potatoes and carrots in their curry. The price was good for its size. None of us finished our meal (not because it wasn't delicious, it was). I'll definitely come back in the future. Give this place a chance if you haven't already.",

    "text": "So friends were in town and we just spent the weekend hiking and camping and were starving for something delicious. What came to mind and what hit the spot was Tonkatsu!  I enjoyed Tonkatsu Kiyoshi before so we hit it up again. This time we tried a few other items.  Here's what we thought of the new items we tried (see original review of the other tasty menu options we've tried):  Fried Spam Musubi - We weren't sure what to expect, but this turned out surprisingly good. The outside was crispy and crunchy, but the frying process didn't make the rice taste greasy or soggy. The spam was tasty. Definitely worth getting.  Katsu Curry - This was great. It's essentially the Hire Katsu (lean cut pork), but with a big heaping portion of curry. The curry flavor was delicious. Keep in mind this is Japanese curry and not Thai curry with all the sweetness, coconut milk, green/yellow/red/etc. This is no nonsense curry with the meat on the side. If you prefer your curry to contain all the ingredients and tasting sweet then you're better off at a Thai restaurant. This dish was great and will likely become my go-to dish I order. Why you ask? Well the Katsu is the same as the Hire Katsu but with curry on the side so you can totally add the Tonkatsu sauce and crushed sesame seeds if you wanted. This dish also includes the miso soup, side salad, and pickled radishes.  Katsu Donburi - This wasn't bad as the katsu layed over a bed of rice and included some onions and fried egg. Overall the flavor was sweet and good. Personally, I prefer the Katsu plates (Hire, Rosu, or Curry), but to each their own.  Definitely a good experience. Also service was great, parking wasn't bad and we didn't have to wait even though the place had a good inflow and outflow of customers.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FFPegvBQOCu0&s=8da04c6f75074dea598fc6b198f63fb2f5943ba227fe42d5d20569f47e2de3b7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/FPegvBQOCu0</a>",

I didn't get her name, but I do believe she's the only waitress there.   FOOD: 1. Potato salad  - If you check in on yelp, you get a free potato salad.   2. Takoyaki - super flavorful. Doesn't have a ridiculous amount of batter.   3. Chicken katsu curry - amazing! The katsu was lightly battered, yet still crunchy and tasty. I didn't feel like it was too heavy for me, which was perfect! I even helped my friend finish her katsu. Lol.   4. Melon ice cream float - I loved it in Japan. Not the same, for some reason. But I definitely enjoyed it.   I'd definitely come back in the future.",

Perfectly crispy and tender at the same time. I got the kire with shrimp and did it as a curry, it was delicious.   The portions here are great and they come with a side of salad with light dressing and miso soup. You will definitely not leave hungry.  The service is excellent and all the wait staff was so attentive.  The sauce used to dipped the katsu is so yummy. It's DIY style and they give you a little mortar and pestle at the beginning of your meal to crush sesame seeds (so fragrant) and add the tonkatsu sauce. It's fun and interactive and you get to portion as much as you want!  Will definitely be back when I have another tonkatsu craving.",

Within 30 minutes the place was packed, so plan for a wait.   There are always specials. Today, we had Gyoza, chicken karaage, fried oysters, and fried spam musubi. All was tasty, fresh, made to order and worth the wait!   My entree was the chicken katsu curry. Big plate of fried chicken cutlets over bed of rice sitting next to a large, dark brown, smooth and creamy curry. I did managed to get a couple of veggies within the curry.  I also got a small salad and a bowl of rich, buttery miso soup! And a side of Japanese pickles.    Also tried by family, the hire tonkatsu, a pork tenderloin cutlet served with rice, miso soup, shredded cabbage, and Japanese pickles. And the  Katsu Donburi, it was a thick cut pork loin in a bowl of rice with sauce. Served with miso soup.  Overall, all things tried was very good. Fresh all made to order, had authentic flavors aided by freshly ground sesame seeds my husband made at the table while waiting on the food. Definitely a place to keep on the favorites list!",

    "text": "Tonkatsu Kiyoshi (Las Vegas, NV / Southwest)  They have an amazing katsu,  first name Tori. I love more than just their chicken, so here's my story.  We start with crushing sesame seeds, to combine with our sauce. This is a fun part of dining here, I crush mine like a boss.  The Ebi Fry is good.  I'm not going to lie. But I still prefer the Tori with the Salmon Fry.  It's actually not a combo, they do it anyway. I'm sure there's an extra charge, that I'm willing to pay.  The karaage is crispy, while the musubi is fried. I also love the rice here, and I say that with pride.  Free potato salad, if you check-in through Yelp. I don't have a problem finishing my food, I don't need the help.   The restaurant is small, and expect to wait. The service is always the best, now that's no debate.   We dine here a lot, they know my face. If you want the best katsu, then I recommend this place.  I love Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, they're the best ever. This review is way overdue, it's better late than never.   2019 Yelp Review #16",

    "text": "One of my Top 5 places to go for curry in Vegas.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi specializes in Japanese Cutlet - and it is good! I have been here a few times before and my favorite menu items include the Hire (Pork) Cutlet and Ebi Fry Katsu. I have also tried the Rosu (Thick Cut Porkloin) Katsu and Tori (Chicken) Katsu - these two are a hit or miss for me. I find that they can sometimes turn out a little dry.  The curry has excellent flavor, and unlike most other places, it features fresh carrots. I wish there was a spice level option. I found that the flavor was a little too mild for me - added spice would have been absolutely perfect.  The deep fried spam musubi was so good! It was on the specials menu so cross your fingers for the next time you stop by! The gyoza was delicious as well.  The service is always great here and the atmosphere is pleasant and clean. My least favorite thing is that they are only open 5 days a week from 5pm-10:30pm. So if you're craving good tonkatsu, only for dinner my friends!",

    "text": "Japanese cuisine abounds here in Las Vegas, if you know where to look. Sushi and ramen are the first two items that come to mind when most people think of Japanese food, but there's more to it than just that! There's also street food, udon, and more -- these are typically in Chinatown, though, and there's very few places with quality Japanese food outside of the Chinatown area, which is why when I find a quality place outside of this area I usually end up frequenting it a lot. Such is the case with Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, a Japanese restaurant on the southwest side of town specializing in tonkatsu, or Japanese-style fried pork cutlets.  Of course, they also have many items such as chicken katsu and even fried shrimp and salmon katsu, but for me the pork katsu is just right -- and they have two kinds of katsu as well depending on where in the pig it's from! Hire katsu is typically from the pork filet, while rosu katsu comes from the fattier loin -- and personally, I like the rosu katsu more than the hire katsu. Both types are very good, though! Part of the charm of the restaurant is how they encourage you to make your own sauce using a mortar and pestle to grind up sesame seeds to add to your sauce.  My review covers two separate visits to this restaurant, where I had the rosu katsu as part of a meal set by itself, as part of a katsu donburi, and even as part of a katsu sandwich. In all cases, the pork katsu was perfectly cooked -- crisp on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. However, each preparation of the katsu is also impressive on its own! As part of a meal set, it comes with rice, miso soup, and a simply-dressed cabbage salad with a very light dressing that makes for a full and scrumptious meal. In a katsu donburi, it comes in a rice bowl with eggs and onions -- and it seems to soak up whatever it's cooked in and enhances the flavor even more! The katsu sandwich is the most surprising preparation, though -- even when it's just between two slices of bread, it's still very juicy and very delicious. I actually think that katsu sandwiches would be just as popular, if not more so, than hamburgers if given a chance here in the States... LOL  As I mentioned before, they do have other items on the menu aside from katsu that are delicious and I've often ordered as appetizers. One of the items I like to order as a starter is a chicken and corn croquette that is crisp, fluffy, and surprisingly light compared to other croquettes that I find in Chinatown. The other is a cold tofu dish with ginger, green onion and bonito that I've recently taken a liking to in this heat.  Tonkatsu may oft be overlooked or treated as a side item in other Japanese restaurants, but in Japan it's considered one of the quintessential comfort foods for a reason -- its simplicity in comparison to its results. You can't go wrong with a juicy fried pork cutlet no matter how or what it's served in, which is why for me Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is now my go-to place for tonkatsu. But don't take my word for it -- try it for yourself and see just how comforting a simple pork cutlet can be!",

When you walk in to the restaurant you are greeted enthusiastically.  You can see the chefs and cooks preparing your food through a large, open window. I discovered three people that work there (one is a co-owner) are Hawai'i transplants.   My son ate the pork tonkatsu and shrimp katsu combo and I ate the pork tonkatsu curry and rice. Delicious. You grind sesame seeds and mix it with the slightly spicy tonkatsu sauce. This sauce mix sets this restaurant apart from the rest. My son tried the melon float which was very yummy.  Price is a little more than the average \"plate lunch\". My dish was $13 and I believe my son's was $16-$17. Spend a few more dollars eating there instead of in the slot machine!  I am definitely a fan and will make many more trips there. I hope more Vegas locals and Hawai'i ppl give this place a try.  One more plus, their music playing is Kalapana, C&K, IZ....enough said!  Best of luck to this new restaurant!",

I would definitely pay more for the set. Service is good, with good number of seats. Enough parking space.   Cons: Location. Well, in a few years, this area may be more developed. I did not feel unsafe, though. But then again, I am not from this area.   Thank you so much for spreading the Japanese food goodness other than sushi.

I like how they give you the chance to grind your own toasted sesame seeds to either mix with a tonkatsu sauce or place directly on top of your food.   The tonkatsu sauce was pretty strong but good as long as you get some rice in that mouthful.  Also ordered the potato salad and it was excellent.  Unlike many potato salads, it was light and refreshing as opposed to heavy.  She puts cured cucumbers and, I think, some apply pieces in there.  In any case, it was a nice side to go along with the breaded and fried meat. Curry had a little potato and carrot too.  Would have loved to see a side of corn.  I usually roll like that.  But overall you're gonna get really well cooked katsus, a nice fluffy moist rice, and tasty curry.  I wish I lived closer.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Meals - The meals come with rice, miso soup, cabbage, & pickled pearl onions. The rice & cabbage are unlimited. You just have to ask them for more.        - Preference - I prefer either the Hire (3 pieces of pork) or Tori (chicken) Katsu. The Hire for when I'm hungry & the Tori for when I'm not as hungry. I like my katsu crust crisp and these two dishes provide that.        - Picked pearl onions - A pallet cleanser. Never had it anywhere else, but it was pretty good. It's like a mild onion soaked in sweetness.        - Sauce - At the table there are two containers. Sesame seeds & katsu sauce. They give you a mortar & pestle. Traditionally, you'll take the sesame seeds, crush them with the pestle, and pour the katsu sauce over it and mix. Very authentic.        - Cabbage - The shredded cabbage is given with a Japanese vinaigrette on the side. I usually like ordering a side of Curry so I can pour that over the cabbage and eat it with that. I don't like the sour taste of the dressing as much. **Ordered**        - $12 Hire Katsu Dinner - 3 Pieces of pork katsu. Perfectly breaded. Crispy & delicious. A hungry man's meal.        - $10 Rosu Katsu Dinner - 1 Larger piece of pork katsu that's a bit bigger and oilier.  The oils also make the bottom of the katsu a bit soggy. I preferred the Hire.        - $8 Tori Katsu Dinner - Chicken katsu. Pretty good for a pork alternative.        - $15 Hire Katsu & Shrimp Katsu Dinner - 2 pieces of pork katsu and 2 huge breaded tiger prawns.         - $12 Katsu Donburi - Caramelized onions & egg on top of pork katsu. The egg & onions makes the breaded katsu crust soggy. I think this defeats the purpose of katsu. The added flavor is not worth this trade-off.        - $12 Katsu Curry - The curry makes the katsu crust soggy. I don't really like that. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice local Katsu place. They only serve Katsu, but they serve it well!",

Immediately, we noticed a jar of sesame seeds along with katsu sauce on the table.  Then we were given a mortar and pestle, which was different yet intriguing.  We asked what we were supposed to do with it, and we were told that we can grind up the sesame seeds for extra texture to our sauce.  Our little one enjoyed doing that, of course.  Husband ordered the Hire Katsu and Eby Fry Dinner, and I ordered the Tori Katsu and Eby Fry Dinner.  The sauce with the ground up sesame seeds were also a great addition to the flavor!  Presentation was great, but taste was even better.  The katsu was light and crunchy, not overly saturated with oil, or dense with panko.  Definitely a great place to go if you're looking for great katsu.",

    "text": "It is with great sadness that I have to give them 3 stars, but I have to stick to my guns and rate the restaurants based on food.    I am passionate about Tonkatsu.  Please...don't confuse this with tonkOtsu as in Monta ramen.  Ton means pig.  KAtsu is something fried with panko.  KOtsu is bone as in pork bone broth you make Ramen out of, so please get it straight.  Katsu NOT Kotsu.    When I was in Japan this spring I must have had 3 or 4 tonkatsu meals.  Tonkatsu restaurants are ubiquitous there, not quite as many as Ramen ya's or 7 11's, but you won't have any difficulty finding one when you are in the mood for it. Tonkatsu is a very narrow niche, they only serve fried pork loin (rosu katsu), pork filet (hile katsu), and some places may serve fried prawns and such, but that's usually about it.  Most places do fried oysters from Fall to spring.  Tonkatsu restaurants are somewhat different from other genres like sushi or ramen because people don't/can't make nigiri sushi or ramen from scratch at home, but tokatsu is not very difficult to cook at home.  Then how come tonkatsu restaurants are so popular?  Well...it's because they tend to be cheap, and it's a mess to make at home with deep frying and all, but the most important factor is that SOMEHOW....it tastes so much better when the pros do it.  It's just pork, salt/pepper, egg, flour, and panko deep fried, but I just can't make them like they do in Tokatsu restaurants, that's why I go out to Wako, Saboten, Maisen, etc, with their soft/crispy fried panko layer, but when you sink your teeth into it it oozes with all that nice pork fat juice, that's why!  Somehow it doesn't turn out like that at home.  As I have been saying for years that Vegas needs a tonkatsu place, I was ecstatic to hear that Kiyoshi opened.  it's in the SE corner of Jones and Robindale and it is a cozy clean place with great friendly service.    The menu was a bit busier than I liked but seemed legit and there was rosu katsu as I wanted.  You go to Tonkatsu place, you get rosu katsu.  Tonkatsu restaurants live or die with rosu katsu.    Each table has a sesame grinder and a pot of tonkatsu sauce.  You grind as much sesame you want and add a tonkatsu sauce to make your sesame flavored sauce.    Rosu katsu set looked authentic and promising.  What didn't...was the katsu itself.  It looked a little too brown, dry, and the outer panko layer has separated from the meat and fell apart as it was picked up.  It tasted dry and I could not enjoy any of the juicy pork fat as I bit into it.  It's like going to a Ramen place and having a broth that was tasteless with floppy overcooked noodle.    As I mentioned earlier, it's not hard to cook your own tonkatsu.  In order for me to go and pay money for it, it has to be better, MUCH better than what I can make at home and this wasn't the case.  I'm hoping that perhaps mine was a flop.  But the appeal of eating pork/tonkatsu is in the fat and this particular rosu katsu was not fatty/juicy enough, partially due to overcooking.  I would highly recommend them to keep on working at it until when cut into katsu, a nice juicy pork fat flows out and that meat is ever so slighlty pink.  In japan they use \"mukin\" pork where there is no concern for parasites so some tonkatsu places serve their katsu pretty pinkish.  Doing so in the U.S. probably won't fly, but it certainly does NOT need to be overcooked as they did.  This place has potential, but they need some work on their katsu, perhaps a lot more than \"some\".   I will visit again and hope to see something that doesn't shame their existence as a tonkatsu-ya.  Until then....I'll keep cooking tonkatsu at home.",

So off I went to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi based on the great Yelp reviews.    If you like tonkatsu, you will really enjoy this place. The tonkatsu is lightly breaded and crisp, yet not greasy, and the meat is fresh and moist. On my first bite, I could tell that the quality of the meat was high. The tonkatsu dipping sauce tasted home made and was flavorful, and much better than the store bought variety. Although the dinner portion is not large, the meal came with red miso soup that was made with high quality red miso and seaweed. It also came with thinly sliced cabbage with a light ponzu salad dressing. I also had the kara age that was excellent as well.  Overall, an excellent meal that was fairly priced for the quality of the ingredients.",

    "text": "There are generally two kinds of tonkatsu. The kind you find in Japan, which is akin to eating fine dining meat--tender and juicy. And the kind you find in fast food joints in America, which tastes like fried cardboard doused in sweet sauce. Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is of the first variety. Succulent, perfectly cooked morsels of pork, chicken or salmon. Here, you get authentic Japanese tonkatsu, but in Las Vegas, NV, of all places! And in a nondescript mini mall out in the suburbs.  The portions are large, with delicious white rice, miso soup, pickled onions, salad, and a nice dollop of potent mustard to accompany the table-ground sesame seed tonkatsu sauce. I have eaten at this restaurant at least 15 times and I often take out-of-town guests. It never disappoints.  Kiyoshi, the original owner and chef, recently left for a new opportunity. Let's hope that the new crew maintains the same level of service and quality.",

    "text": "So I found this little gem of a place in the south west part of town. I love the ambiance, and most importantly i love their tonkatsu! I have not tried the curry one yet because i always order the same think, either chicken or pork tonkatsu!. The breading is light and crunchy and not greasy at all! I love how they plate the food and i love how you get to grind your own sesame seeds and mix it with the tonkatsu sauce, add a little lemon to it and it is absolutely divine! I am not big on cabbage that gets served with it, so they actually let me customize my order and exchange for more rice instead! Customer service is good, i think its because the owner tries to make it a point to always greet their customers coming and going, only one comment though, the single server that is working the shift kind of moves too slow and fails to acknowledge you if you need anything else, but hey that was only one time. Also the only thing that irks me a little is that they open your can of soda and pour it in a glass for you, which is just not my preference, but hey i wont let that spoil my party! I definitely will go back to this place, it is definitely worth the drive just so i can taste the best tonkatsu in las vegas! And as a cherry on top, prices are reasonable as well!",

The pricing was OK for the dishes. But that's not why I am writing this. Our kids had fun grinding the sesame seeds into a powder before adding the katsu sauce to it. We ordered the shishito pepper appetizer. It was done correctly and thank you for having sichimi pepper on the condiment tray. I love eating the pepper with sichimi. The edamame is edamame. Thank you for seasoning it, my kids loved it. I ordered the salmon and shrimp katsu and my wife the pork curry katsu. The portions were nice. The serving plate that they served our main dishes on just made the portions bigger. I was happy they placed the katsu on this little metal drain rack that prevented the katsu from sitting in it's on fat drippings like most other restaurant do, thank you. The miso soup was good, the little pickled onion was good. The one that shocked me was the yuzu dressing that came with my dish. Yeah, I said, yuzu. It is to be tossed with the shredded cabbage. I like this touch because normally you would eat oil soaked cabbage with a shot of lemon juice from a lemon wedge that normally comes with the dish. The curry dish was good too. I would write about it but I was too busy enjoying my plate. And btw.....the server lady that we had today is SUPER NICE. She gave off this COMFORTING FEEL that made our night so pleasant. THANK YOU!",

    "text": "I've been putting off going to this place for months. What's so special and exciting about a katsu restaurant when I can make katsu at home? It's quick and easy to make and it's yummy.  There was a bunch of stuff occupying our table - what is all this mess? Salt, pepper, togarashi, a bowl of sesame seeds, a bowl of katsu sauce, a mortar and pestle...and fake flowers. I was busy grinding my sesame seeds for my katsu that I forgot to look at the menu. I've been here quite a few times to try everything on the menu as much as I can. The consistent observation I have is that no matter what kind of protein you get, it won't be dry and it will be delicious. Not oily at all. Their dinners and combinations come with rice, miso soup, shredded cabbage and Japanese pickles.  Kara'age: Breaded and deep-fried pieces of chicken. Salty, mildly sweet and spicy. They're a little bit overcooked so they taste a bit burnt but the inside wasn't dry. I'll skip this next time. 3/5  Beef Tataki: Thin slices of lightly seared beef with a ponzu + daikon dipping sauce. 4.5/5  Chicken Katsu Curry: Panko-breaded and deep-fried chicken, comes with rice and miso soup only. This is not on the menu but you can definitely ask for chicken instead of pork. The katsu itself was great but the curry is better at Zen. 4/5  Hire Katsu and Shrimp Katsu: Panko-breaded and deep-fried pork tenderloin katsu and shrimps.   Tori Katsu Dinner: Panko-breaded and deep-fried chicken. 5/5  Salmon Fry Katsu Dinner: Usually, when you deep-fry salmon, it gets pretty dry and flaky (kind of like dandruff). But here at Kiyoshi, they know how to do it right. 5/5  Pineapple Panna Cotta: This was so good and had the perfect pineapple flavor to it. I'm tired of plain old panna cotta and creme brulee. This has whipped cream and coconut shavings on top...like a pina colada panna cotta. 4/5   Green tea Cheesecake: I've had green tea cheesecake that have been pure fail where you can hardly taste green tea. THIS is how green tea cheesecake was meant to taste like. 5/5  The service has always been great. Friendly and very attentive. The food comes out within 10-15 minutes after ordering.",

I am so glad I did!  After reading many rave reviews, I decided on the chicken katsu curry.  Oh boy, this entree was huge.  I had half of it for lunch, and the other half for lunch the next day.  The chicken katsu was crispy and moist, the curry was fragrant and had bold flavors, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  Though I didn't need to make the katsu sauce for my curry entree, I made it anyways.  Was my first time, and I enjoyed the experience.  I will definitely return...tomorrow even.",

The workers are always very friendly and attentive. I can only really comment of their katsu and curry since those are the only items I've gotten but I would assume everything else is quite tasty. I usually go for their tonkatsu curry plate and I've never been disappointed. Their curry even has veggies in it!   They do the mortar and pestle to grind up your sesame seeds for the katsu sauce. It's a fun thing to do and kill time before your katsu arrives! Besides the tonkatsu, they also have chicken, different cuts of pork and ebi fry. I've also tried their Japanese potato salad and gyoza. Both were good. Nothing spectacular but I would expect their katsu to really shine, and it does!  It's in a rather unassuming business plaza in SW Vegas and they do get quite busy especially at night during dinner hours, which is unfortunately when I tend to go. They do to go orders too if you want to avoid waiting and just eat at home.",

You also can grind sesame seeds at your table to mix with your katsu sauce. The katsu was crisp and tasty, and the curry was thick with chunks of potatoes. As far as price, this place isn't too bad; I just wished they offered bigger portions. Although I was satisfied, it didn't quite hit the spot. Service was very friendly, and it's a quaint little restaurant.",

    "text": "Superior.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi absolutely knows what they're doing and serves up some of the best katsu and donburi I have ever had.  The place just opened a few months ago but it has a great story and family tradition of delicious cuisine from Japan.    The mega surprise was the Tonkatsu (Pork) Katsu Donburi.  Thoughtfully garnished with tender roasted sushito peppers, the savory bowl is layered with thick, JUICY cuts of lean pork covered with perfectly golden and crisp panko breadding.  To finish it off comes a smothering of a flavorful collaboration of  delicious egg, onion, dashi soy sauce and other seasonings.  This simmer of flavors was poured on top of the rice and settled to the bottom of the bowl making the rice SO DAMN TASTY!    Curry Katsu and chicken Katsu were delicious too.  Don't forget to order some sides.  My favorite was the potato salad with diced apples to add a little sweet and crunch to an already good salad.  There is katsu sauce tableside and you can add some roasted sesame and mix it up with your own mortar and pestle .  This place is good, no doubt.  It is now on my list to visit every time I go to Vegas.  It was a hit with the kids.  Come for a late lunch to avoid the crowds.  Show this place some love and give it a try and you might become a regular too.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to try this place out for months and finally was able to cross it off my bookmarks on Friday. The 1st thing I noticed was the small menu, and there wasn't really much choice besides various katsus...hence their name. We ordered chicken katsu and a pork katsu curry. Both katsu entrees were very crispy the breading was a perfect golden brown. I liked the chicken a little more since it was lighter and juicer than the pork. Definitely some of the better katsu entrees I've ever had, but I thought the pricing was a little steep for some fried meat, rice and miso soup.    I was a little confused on how to make the katsu sauce and I found myself mashing up a concoction of sesame seeds and sauce together which apparently isn't the way it's supposed to be done? I also thought you were supposed to mash up the little shalots/onions they give you...Eventually I gave up and just ate everything plain...I still have no idea how to properly prepare the sauces, shalots, etc.  Dining experience here is ok...while the service was great, it was super hot in the dining area which made it uncomfortable since I felt hot and sweaty the whole meal. Is there not a/c that can be turned on during business hours? I felt like I drank 4-5 glasses of water because it was so hot and then I pretty much lost my appetite from filling up on water instead of food.  I would come back again but it wouldn't be my 1st choice. Their food was good, but maybe next time I'll grab it to go instead of suffering through a 80-90 degree dining room.",

    "text": "For starters, I hate katsu and I am not a fan of it at all. However, my friends wanted to go there and I figured I'd might as well work with something new. We came in right before the dinner rush and was seated within 5 minutes. We were given menus to look over and they did not ask us for our drinks until 10 minutes after seating. They didn't take our order until 25 minutes after being seated. It was frustrating because like I have mentioned, I hate katsu and having to wait for almost half an hour wasn't giving me a good impression to want to eat at this place. The dinning area was full I understand and there were two of the servers walking around.   After just waving one of them down we ordered our food. I ordered their \"Tori Katsu & Ebi Fry\" and my fiance got the \"Rosu Katsu Curry.\" Looking at the menu your food comes with white rice, miso soup, and a type of pickled veggie on the side. They set it up on a serving platter for each plate and they do have good presentation. My friends ordered the Rosu Katsu as well and had some sides with it. There's a Yelp check-in where you obtain a free Potato salad. All four of us were yelpers and found this place from Yelp (of course), and when we wanted to redeem each check-in for ourselves our guy server said we could only use one. I understand there's a limitation BUT do not offer a check-in incentive to people if it'll be one per table, keep in mind that your business attracts a lot of yelpers so I hope they accommodate in the future! It was our first time here and we chose this business because Yelp suggested you so it would have been great to experience an individual bowl of potato salad. We split that bowl between us 4, literally one bite. It was good and I wish we individually got to experience our own bowls so we could all equally enjoy the food.   Anyways, that issue aside we waited for another 20 minutes for our food. I don't know what was going on? Short staff or lack of urgency? Because our guy server wasn't up to par with us, barely served us and we sat at the front but the lady server was hustling. She ended up checking up on us more than he did (thank you!) Katsu was delicious, this place did turn me into a katsu lover to be honest. Their miso soup was just as good and perfect to start or end your meal. During our dining experience there was also flies flying around. It was an annoyance, couldn't enjoy my katsu without tryna slap the air. Lol towards the ending the lady server served us more than our original server and she was such a sweetheart! We came in around 7:30pm and left a little before closing so that's an idea as to how long it took for us to wait for our original server to get or drinks/ orders, to deliver our food, and give us the bill. I could have came on an off day but the lady server was busting her butt ensuring we left satisfied so there should never be an excuse as to why the first server's customer service/ urgency wasn't good.   For the two plates my fiance and I ordered cost about $33 with tax. It's bittersweet. The food is delicious and our second lady server was awesome. However, it just bothers me how they have the check-in offer and limits it to one table, their wait time is pretty long, and their other server wasn't up to par.",

Their katsu was on dry side, and we did not ask for a well-done. Chicken karaage batter had good seasoning and the meat was juicy. Takoyaki was average. However, their service was great. (typical Japanese restaurant service) and we would come back again to give their katsu another chance!",

    "text": "Pretty solid joint for pork katsu. I liked the pork and the shrimp both, and the \"salad\" has a good dressing, despite being nothing more than shredded cabbage. The dinner plates come with miso soup and a couple Japanese pickles (pickled onions), too. It's kinda fun to grind up your own sesame seeds for your custom sauce, but I don't think it makes much difference in the flavor. At $13/plate, it's a pretty good deal, but I'd appreciate a lunch special that had less meat and maybe no soup for like $8? The main drawback: with a menu focused on fried pork, with a couple extra sides, you have to really be wanting that to drive out of your way to Kiyoshi's.",

I've been visiting since before they had their liquor license. It's a bit of a hike for me and every time I'm in this side of town, this is my go to place for lunch or dinner.   I had the shrimp this time with a side of curry. There curry is amazing for dipping and also with rice! The usual self ground sesame with tonkatsu sauce was skipped since I had a serious curry craving!  For a dollar more I got the shrimp vs the chicken and shrimp combo. Maybe I got bigger shrimp? I don't know but even tho I was satisfied I kinda felt like the 2 shrimp plus chicken for a dollar less was a better deal than my 3 shrimp for a dollar more and no chicken. And my server did recommend the chicken and shrimp combo. Should have listened to her!  Oh well live and learn! The food is awesome so that's why I come here when I can!",

They have also mastered the art of frying as every time I come here the chicken or pork has a nice golden color and never burnt!!! It is breaded so soft that when you take a bite it just melts in your mouth.  If you don't know what to pick and eat there then go for their Katsu Curry it is one of the best!   They do offer side dishes and if they have it available I highly recommend getting the deep fried oysters! That side dish is amazing!  The restaurant itself is very maintained and super clean.   The customer service is great! They are very kind and personable.   Only downfall is that this is a small restaurant and there are not many tables so if you come during peak dinner time you will most likely have to wait for a table. That's the only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 star.",

Tonight we had the deep-fried soft shell crab and deep-fried oysters.  Both we very good.  I have tried the octopus balls before and definitely with a try. The katsu dishes are served with shredded cabbage...I sprinkle mine with just lemon...even though dressing is provided...soooo good. Perfect with the katsu.  Service is always amazing.

I'm talking about six tables.  Usually this would deter me a bit, but somehow, it worked toward the charm of this place.  It is comfy and cozy, and the Hawaiian music playing in the background made me very nostalgic as I longed for another trip back.  Now onto the food.  I ordered the salmon and shrimp.  It was amazing!!!  Everything was super fresh, the miso soup was perfect, and it's so fun to get to make your own sauce!  The breading on the salmon and pork is seriously outstanding.  Not greasy at all... Nice and light, and crisp.  I later found out that this is due in part to the owner's sourcing of fresh panko... Not the hard, dry kind we buy at the grocery store.  And please, if you like potato salad even a bit, order it here!!!  It's the owner's grandmother's recipe, and it's so unique and delicious.  Potato salad with chunks of apples and slices of cucumber?  Somehow, it totally works!  The service was just as awesome as the food.  Being newbies, our waitress was super helpful, and the owner went around to every table, including ours.  He is so kind and personable!  We will be back many times in the future!",

What really sets it apart from other miso soups is that they use a darker miso than most other restaurants do.   The portions of the main meal was also decent. You get a nice big piece of katsu along with the rice and miso soup and it really fills you up. However their side dishes are a little overpriced. They taste really good but the price is just too high for the quantity you get.   As far as service everybody there is really friendly and helpful. A little awkward at some parts during the night. Couldnt really put my finger on what it was but it felt a little uneasy. But still really good service.",

To the ginger sauce that made my \"non-vegetable-eating\" girlfriend devour the whole salad that came with her meal.

    "text": "Finally decided to try this place. It's right behind where I live. It's located in a strip mall right next to a smoke shop and dry cleaners (I think?). Couple things I noticed about this place... First, it's deep on the south side of town. It doesn't bother me as much since this is my neighborhood. However, if this place seeks to be a busy business, it's a far reach. Second, if it wasn't for word of mouth and a flyer, I probably wouldn't have found this place. It's literally hidden. The strip mall itself is brand new and it's located in a residential area. The place itself is small for a restaurant but it's cozy.   Now... For the food... I'm a fan of Katsu dishes. For the price that you pay on this joint, it's pretty loaded. You get a decent amount of food for your order. It comes with Miso soup as well. I was lucky to have met the owner during my visit and he was very accommodating (asking if it's your first time and what not), introduces you to the menu and lays you the details. As soon as your order is taken, you have the chance to make your own Katsu dressing. They have all the ingredients laid out on a small tray on every table. This allows you to set your own sauce for your liking.   I forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it came with shrimp tempura and the Katsu itself, paired with rice, cabbage and Miso soup. I'm a very simple guy when it comes to taste. I believe my dish was served well. The amount of breading used wasn't overboard either. Seasoning is just right and not too salty. Unfortunately, i went here on a Monday night and I was the only one eating. It made the experience a little awkward since everyone was pretty much just staring at me while I pig out.   I would definitely give this place another go. It's the type of joint you won't go to as much considering the prices of their food but it's a thumbs up in my book. The place has potential. It just needs to market itself more due to its location. Hopefully, it will pick up business when the sports bar next door opens.",

    "text": "Tried Tonkatsu Kiyoshi last night. It was recommended to us by our sister-in-law. When we first arrived, the place was packed. Both the bar seats and tables were full. There was one group of 4 waiting for a table ahead of us, but we were able to squeeze into a seat at the bar. The decor and atmosphere of the tiny restaurant did not seem thought out too well. I think the main turn off was how incredibly bright the place was. I think if there's one major detail to dining out, it's good lighting. The waitress was handling all the checks at the bar, and there was really no separation between the back counter and the bar, so that was a little odd too. We could see the employees personal things piled on a chair in front, along with what looked like a bug zapper. Weird. There was also a basket of pens and crap on the bar too, which I think was a little distracting at first.   We ordered the edamame and beef tataki to start. The beef tataki was served with shredded onions and citrus ponzu that I mixed with grated daikon. I really enjoyed that. So good.   For dinner I ordered the Tonkatsu and shrimp combo which is a pretty good deal, considering it comes with miso, rice, shredded cabbage salad and pickled onions. It's a good size portion as well. You mixed your own katsu sauce too at the table (which is basically just grinding sesame seeds, then poring in Tonkatsu sauce) The shrimp was huge too, like prawn size. And they lay the fried katsu meats on a wire rack to keep it crispy, which is always a good thing. I thought my meal was delicious and worth the $16 that it cost.   My bf orders the katsu curry, which came with miso, rice, curry and katsu. He devoured his dish so it must have been tasty.   For dessert, we got the green tea cheesecake, which was good too, but a lot of Japanese restaurants carry that as a dessert item. I was happy with the meal, just wish they could create a better ambiance by fixing that damn lighting.",

Even though it's not in Japan and in a newish strip mall in the Las Vegas area, this place reminded me of my time living in Japan. They specialize in Japanese panko-covered fried food, and they do it very well.  Their food is fresh and homemade.  And it's very reasonable.  We tried the pork hire-katsu, chicken katsu, katsukare (pork with curry sauce), chicken kara-age, Japanese potato salad, crab and cucumber salad, and shishito peppers.  All excellent.  The owners are terrific too and are worth supporting.  Since we escaped the overpriced halls of Mandalay Bay to come to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, based on the strength of the Yelp reviews, we couldn't have been more satisfied with our meal.  Whether you are local or a tourist, get thee to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi.  PS We loved this place so much that we went twice!",

Since they only serve tonkatsu, they do this really well.  We have  only tried Hawaiian style tonkatsu but this place has a different take on their tonkatsu, they serve it with grounded sesame seed with tonkatsu sauce, the cabbage that comes along with tongkatsu is splendid, its a nice pairing of deep fried meats and salad with ginger miso dressing.   This place is definitely   must try.",

    "text": "Being Japanese I have a natural craving to eat amazing Japanese food! It's rare to find something so good that rivals even the best in Japan! But I must say this tonkastu is one of the best I've had in a long time! The Hire Katsu (thinner cut of pork) and Rosu Kastu (thicker cut of pork) are both prepared perfectly with just the right amount of panko breading and very tender.  If it's your first time visiting this place, I would recommend the Hire over the Rosu Katsu as most of you will probably enjoy a thinner pork cut. The shrimp Kastu is a must! I wouldn't be suprised if these were more tiger prawns than typical jumbo shrimp as they are huge! Good thing they have a Hire & Shrimp Katsu combo ($15.00).    As far as the Chicken Katsu goes, I'd give it a 3.5/5 so I wouldn't recommend trying this on your first trip.   All in all, I give this place a 4/5. Amazing Kastu but it's can be a bit pricey. Happy Eating Folks!",

I also ordered the cucumber crab salad with kewpie dressing and a side of curry. Kewpie dressing is normally creamy and nutty this dressing was not.   The panko batter on both the chicken and pork was light and crunchy. I liked the chicken more because the pork lacked flavor. The curry was no different than the curry bars I have used at home. The rice was overcooked and mushy. I did like the well developed flavor profile of the miso soup and the ginger dressing on the salad was refreshing.   I was going to order the green tea cheesecake but after seeing the pictures showing the tiny sliver of cheesecake accompanied by a big scoop of ice cream I chose to pass.",

There are six tables and a bar-type area for seating. You're welcomed immediately with a nice \"Irrashaimase!\" and it sounds like they've practiced because the pronounciation sounded almost native Japanese. The tables are a good size and the seats are comfy. In the middle of the table is a nice set up where you can mix up your own tonkatsu sauce and roasted sesame seeds. Pretty damn brilliant.  For starters we got the karaage chicken and beef tataki. Excellent dishes. The presentation and portioning are just right, and so is the price. For the main course, I had the Hire & Ebi combo and let me tell you, the breading and texture were just like back home in Japan. The presentation was just like you'd walked into a tonkatsu place in Shinjuku or Yokohama. These guys pulled it off legit. To finish things off, you must, MUST try their yuzu pannacotta. Get there early and order it quick, because they'll sell out.   Overall, it was a 5 star yelp experience. It's rare that I go to a place twice in a week, let alone 2 days in a row. Yes, it was that good! Go! Go now! Bring your friends!",

Both restaurants offer comparable quality of food, but Yu-Yu is slightly better that they offer Tonjiru and other very good side items. But Kiyoshi's no shortage of its own strength, their focus on the core competence is a right strategy as their execution proves. Also, Kiyoshi feels much like a restaurant-next-door in Japan.  I'll keep patronize them as long as they keep it that way.",

Not only are the cuts of meat made up of actual meat (as opposed to the other places that over-bread), but it's cooked to a masterful crispy-brown perfection each and every time.

Service:  staff greeted us upon entering the door and seated us.  Very friendly, very accommodating.  Constantly checking if we need anything.   Food: I ordered the chicken tonkatsu and shrimp combo while my daughter ordered the pork tonkatsu.  The serving, in my opinion is too big for one person but I ended up eating almost all of it (delish).  They had a special side order and we got the fried spam masubi (excellent) and the fried quid tentacles (was fried too much). I specially like how they engage their customer and making them pound and grind their own sesame seeds and make their own sauce for dipping.   Cost: reasonable cost of food considering how big the serving is.  Side order price is reasonable also at $5 per order.    All in all, great place to eat and hang out.  Excellent food and excellent service.  Too bad that it is so far away from where we live but definitely will go back there if we are in the vicinity of the place.",

What was cool is that they give you a pestle and mortar to grind your own sesame seeds down into fine powder to add to your katsu sauce which I was blown away by. I felt like I was in 5th grade all over again.  They have exceptional service. Whenever my water was empty the waitress would run over and fill it immediately. The interior was really cute, a few tables and a large bar. They don't serve beer yet which is a shame because I guess they're a fairly new restaurant and still awaiting on their liquor license.  We ordered the tiger shrimp & chicken katsu dinner which was only 14$ It was such a great deal. It also came with this spicy mustard that I recommend to add to your katsu  sauce. It came with miso soup and this yummy shredded lettuce salad. Also, we got the beef tataki $7 which was cooked perfectly, and decorated with a bed of onions and some weird sauce. Lastly, we got the soft shell crab $7 which was ahhhhhhmaaaaaaazzzzinnnngggg! I will definitely be getting that again.  Our total bill was 30$ which is a steal. I was definitely be back, I want to see if they will make me a chicken katsu curry because I do not eat pork!",

I enjoyed making my own tonkatsu sauce by adding sesame seeds, but the sauce is missing a kick in my opinion. Im not an expert in japanese foods of course. I wish the sauce had a little more spiciness to it.",

This new restaurant is super cute with a lot of wood furniture, table top seating, and a bar area to sit at.   They specialize in fried foods! Their main menu up front has pork katsu, salmon katsu, and chicken katsu platters on the front side and you can do the same platters with a fried shrimp for a couple bucks more. They start at like $12 and end at $16 and come with a salad and miso soup.  Today I chose the pork katsu don which is a bowl with a bunch of sauce, grilled onions, and an egg on top. It was a big portion for a bowl which I was glad about. The meat was a bit over cooked in my opinion but the flavors were there.   We had karaage, fried squid, takoyaki, sausage as appetizers. The takoyaki and squid legs were awesome!   The food was really good. I didn't finish the bowl. The only thing I didn't like was the karaage. I like a more breaded karaage.   For all of those appetizers, two drinks, two entrees, and 4 appetizers we spent $50. I thought it was a good price. The service was good.",

The first thing I noticed when pulling into this plaza was that this was the former spot for a place called Rice Trax back in the day.   We came with a group of friends and ordered a few different sides. I only tried the Fried Spam Musubi because I wanted to save room for my main meal, but it was very good. The batter was light and crispy, and I like how it wasn't greasy. Since I've been craving a lot of curry lately, I ordered the Katsu Curry. I wasn't expecting the curry to be awesome since this is not a curry house, but it was still pretty good. The Pork Katsu was cooked well and easy to eat. The curry wasn't too thick or too watery and it had a good flavor. I also liked how it only had potatoes and carrots, would have been disappointed if they had like big pieces of onions in it! For dessert, we had the Green Tea Cheesecake which is not recommended! It was tiny, bland and it didn't taste anything like Green Tea!!  Service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is pretty small - there were 6 tables with 4 chairs each. Check in on the Yelp app to get a free potato salad or seaweed salad. Will definitely return!",

Gets full around lunch time so come a little early or later.   I have had the Takoyaki - always good. Tried the chicken karaage today and it was nothing special, tried the cucumber and octopus salad and the dressing was too sour for my taste, but very refreshing.   Got the pork loin katsu and it was delicious! Perfectly crispy but soft and chewy on the inside, the meal comes with: bowl of rice, salad (I thought the pile of cabbage was for garnish my first time here and didn't even touch it ), miso soup, and fermented white radish. The portion does to look too big but it is... Stuffed every time!   Another great thing about this place is the service! The waitress is always so perky and friendly, answered any questions with had with enthusiasm, she made the meal extra enjoyable!! Would definitely recommend this place! Will continue to come back!",

It's a very small location, so if it's busy, you'll definitely have to wait. We were lucky and came on a quiet night so we were able to enjoy our stay.   We grinder our seeds like I read to do and added the katsu sauce. I ordered the pork tenderloin cutlet with curry and rice. The combo also came with a salad and miso soup. It was a lot of food. Definitely enough for two. My boyfriend ordered the cutlet with cabbage, and two sides of miso soup as a substitute for white rice. That cutlet was breaded to perfection. Every bite was warm and crunchy. Add that with the curry, and katsu sauce, and I was dying. Definitely plan on a large meal, because by the time I walked out of there I felt I had eaten an entire house full of food.",

We were actually looking for an Italian restaurant, and close by was more of a pizza place, not so much pasta.   Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is definitely a hidden gem. It is next to the Euphoria Wellness dispensary. It is a small family owned restaurant. They have bar style seating along with normal restaurant seating. They have a specials board and a normal menu. Their menu ranges from $5-$18.   They literally have the best katsu in Las Vegas that I've tried so far. Depending on how I am feeling I either get the Chicken katsu or one of the tonkatsu. It's a hefty serving! It comes with rice and salad. The salad is just shredded cabbage but whatever the dressing is made out of is the best! It pairs well with the katsu! You also get a side of miso soup and a little pickled shallots. Everything is so good. You also get to make your sauce with the tonkatsu sauce and crushed sesame seeds.   The tonkatsu donburi is my second favorite. When I order food to go or for pick up, I always get the donburi mostly because if I ordered the normal katsu, it might get soggy. The Donburi is really good! It also comes with the miso soup. Make sure you try it out!   The melon soda float makes for a drink/dessert. Just saying!  Oh and the service is great!!!",

I remember being overwhelmed by how expensive this place was for basically a rice bowl. Yeah you get a miso soup and a salad, big woop.   I had ordered the Hire Katsu dinner which was slightly undercooked. My friend ordered the Katsu curry, which is a joke, because they use the same curry base from the box you get for $1.50 at 99 ranch market. So to be charged $11 for something i can make by heating up in the microwave at home bugs me. I also remember wasting a lot of time and effort grinding the sesame seeds to not even use it in the end.   So I tried to give it another try a couple years later, and am still not impressed. Not sure if the prices have been the same or got even more expensive. My friend and I ordered the chicken and the Katsu donburi. This time a little overcooked but nothing to be upset about. I definitely don't plan on coming back, especially if the prices continue to be that steep.",

    "text": "Great and honest food in a residential corner of Las Vegas away from overrated strip.  Do your wallet a favor and try good food in real Las Vegas. This place specializes in Tonkatsu which is a Japanese cutlet - the coating is light and crispy but the meat is more moist that a schnitzel.  We sat at the bar and talked with the owner, smart cookie- very friendly and knowledgeable of her trade.  The dishes don't exceed 17 or 18 bucks.  We had the chicken and pork Tonkatsu with fried Squid.  Just by looking at the coating and fresh smell of the cutlets you could tell that the oil was fresh and not old. The color of coating was cinnamony brown which is the right color for deep fried food.  Price very reasonable-  this is a hidden gem",

    "text": "Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a restaurant that specializes in several different katsu dishes, and this place definitely has the best chicken katsu that you can ever find in Las Vegas! I really enjoy how their chicken katsu is thinly sliced and thoroughly breaded with a perfect crunch it! The chicken katsu plate comes with a large serving of cabbage salad, miso soup, and rice. If you are not super hungry, this is definitely a plate that you can share with a friend or family member!  Another thing that I enjoy about this restaurant is my ability to make my own tonkatsu dipping sauce! They provide their patrons with a pestle and mortar to grind sesame seeds, add tonkatsu sauce, and add flavorings to their liking. Creating my own tonkatsu sauce definitely makes this dining experience fun!  If you are looking for a hidden gem in the southwest area, definitely try Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, and get their chicken katsu!",

Great quality appetizers such as chicken karaage, octopus balls, croquets, fried spam musubi's and a standard, yet thirst quenching Asian beer selection.  The staff is extremely friendly with roots in guest service from one of the best properties on the strip (think Ocean's 11 to avoid any trademark issues). The location itself is a bit small however the only time this becomes a problem is the lunch and dinner rush.  There is no way to describe the best breaded Chicken Katsu in town until you've dipped your piece (chicken piece that is) in their sauce and let your taste buds do the talking.   They're set up for six - 4 tops and  bar seating. They do to-go orders but I highly recommend you take your time with this and done in.  I promise you, you will not find better Katsu in Las Vegas.",

They are only open for dinner, and they're closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays.   My solid go-to is the chicken katsu. It's lightly fried and full of flavor. You get a deliciously warm cup of miso soup, a generous helping of cabbage, a cup of rice, and some lemon wedges to enhance your experience.   The staff is attentive and always friendly.",

Usually I eat at Indian restaurants and occasionally I have some Thai curry but this was no match for either.   We started with appetizers, of course. Their special fried oysters(5$) and some seaweed salad(2.50$)  The oysters were AMAZING! The sauce that it comes with just melts in your mouth. Definitely top 5 oysters I've ever had. The seaweed salad was pretty standard, it was delicious but not a MUST-HAVE.   I checked in on Yelp for their free side of potato salad and never received it but we were already getting full from the appetizers so we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it fully.   I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry (11$) and the portion was humongous! It came with a side salad, and miso soup. The soup was fantastic. Finally, a soup that tasted fresh and not frozen from a bag!  The salad on the other hand had barely a sprinkle of any sort of dressing. That's something that needs to be changed.   The curry itself is a must have and I can't want to try the rest of the items on their menu!   Last but certainly not least. The Green Tea Cheesecake! It was a small portion for 5$ but the cheesecake was so delicious I didn't care about the price. It comes with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream as well.   This is definitely a place to visit if you're craving Katsu ANYTHING!!",

    "text": "It's not like this place needs another 5-star review but here goes!  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is oddly surrounded by houses, located on a secluded corner on Jones & Robindale. It's a small place with only 6 or so tables of 4. I love the simplicity of the decorations & lighting. Also, thanks for playing good ass music!  Anyway, onto the food. It's customary to grind your sesame seeds and put a dollop of katsu sauce. Really good paired with their delicious katsu. Check in on Yelp for your free potato salad btw, one per table. It was pretty good.   Appetizer: Takoyaki- Crispy skin and creamy batter inside with yummy tako, each one swirled with the sauces and topped with yummy bonito flakes. Perfect meal starter!  Entrees: Hire Katsu Curry & Chicken Katsu Curry- Holy ish, they're not a curry house but their curry paired with their crispy, tender katsu is AMAZING. It really is the ultimate comfort food. The curry was the right amount of mild spice & if you prefer spicy, they'll suggest to bring cayenne pepper to spice it up. Honestly though, it's already good without it. The curry had a few pieces of carrots & potatoes too.   Hire, apparently, is a thinner, more tender cut of pork. It was so good, not salty & super crispy. The chicken was cooked very well too! Entrees come with hot miso soup & salad (dressing wasn't really my favorite but who cares at this point).   Basically, we found a new go-to spot! The customer service is excellent cause they're really the sweetest & the prices are worth the amount & quality of food you get. Can't wait to come back!",

The pork was tender and flavorful, and the crispy crust might be my favorite katsu breading to date. Left very satisfied and very full.   Would be a 5-Star review - no questions asked. Definitely eat here. It's awesome.   BUT  Because of the weird hours and random closures, it has taken 9 months to eat here. Literally. My friend and I first tried to eat here last July. Hopefully we manage to dine again before February. Lol. Not entirely their fault, just an unfortunate reality of time. Minus one star.",

We got here before the height of dinner time, which was great since they don't have a lot of seating inside. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Oh and plenty of parking in their lot.   Their menu is not too extensive and prices are fair. When you dine in and you get the sets, you can get free refills for the cabbage salad, miso soup and rice. Their miso soup is excellent and very flavorful The cabbage salad is great with the ume dressing. There's also a side of spicy mustard if you want to dip your tonkatsu in it.  You also get to grind your own sesame seeds before you add the tonkatsu sauce in your dipping dish. That was fun to do!  The boyfriend got the thick cut tonkatsu with curry and rice. The curry was super flavorful and there was a very slight kick to it. His tonkatsu was on the thicker side compared to my friend who got the thinner tonkatsu.  If you order the thicker cut tonkatsu you get one. If you get the thinner cut, you get two. I ordered the tonkatsu set. It came with rice, cabbage salad, miso soup, a side of little pickled onions and three pieces of tonkatsu. The tonkatsu was cooked to perfection. It wasn't dry and not oily at all. The dipping sauce definitely pairs well with the meet. The cabbage salad was great with the ume dressing. Oh and my other friend ordered the set with the ebi and the shrimp was HUGE!  definitely worth the price point. Overall it was a very filling meal. I didn't even finish it. I would definitely go back again since it was really good.",

Came here Becuase of their Groupon promo which was two meals came out to be $12. What a steal ! First you start of by making your own sauce, and grinding the sesame seeds with the Katsu sauce which was very creative.   The plate combo was served with miso Soup, cabbage, rice, and pickeled baby onion. Everything on my plate balanced very well for my appetite. This place is my favorite and will come back again soon.

Next time I come back, I would probably want to share this with a friend because the portion was too big for me to finish. Besides that, it tastes really good! You can also dip the meat in the tonkatsu sauce that's already on the table. You would just have to crush up the sesame seeds yourself while waiting for the food. If you check into Yelp, there's a choice of free complimentary potato salad or seaweed salad. I picked the potato salad and it was yummy! The meal costed me a little over $11 but it's well worth the price for what you get! The entree I ordered came in a dinner set that also included miso soup and salad. The miso soup was too salty for my taste. Other than that, I'm content with my meal.",

Yes, after a hard day at work, you can come to this place and just eat and go.   This is probably the only specialty tonkatsu place in Vegas. Yes, it is the best tonkatsu in town.  The tonkatsu is crispy on the first bite but juicy and soft on the second. It is well seasoned and I noticed there is a thin layer of fat in it. I've said it before, fat adds flavor. Love it.  I always order the Katsu Donburi (Katsudon). If you like rice, egg, and pork, then you would do well to order the Donburi.  For appetizers, I circulate between the Karaage, Takoyaki, and Arabiki sausage. All equally good. It's a mood thing that decides which one I order that day.  The place is intimate but simple. Not noisy, a little Hawaiian music playing on the background. Price is decent. Food is great. Service is excellent. 5/5 will repeat.",

    "text": "A great, cute little neighborhood restaurant that everyone should try.   Environment: The restaurant itself is in a more residential area in the southwest area of Las Vegas, and while the restaurant may be small, the interior decorating is very cozy and cute, with a lot of decorations and warm colors which provides a nice environment to eat.  Food: While there may be many restaurants in Las Vegas which focus on katsu curry I feel like it is a breath of fresh air to have a restaurant that focuses on tonkatsu. They do have curry dishes as well assorted types of katsu, from chicken to shrimp, however every time I come here I must go for the tonkatsu donburi. A thick, succulent, piece of pork katsu topped with a fried egg, onions, and seaweed served over rice is delicious and filling. Additionally, the selections of appetizers are great to. Their shishito peppers are some of my favorite in Las Vegas, lightly fried to give them a great soft texture with a nice salty taste. Additionally, the ika geo karaage is delicious as well.  Service: Service is great. You can tell that it is a family owned restaurant because everyone who works here is upbeat and cheery, making sure everyone has everything they need and being sure to ask how everything is tasting.  Overall, this is somewhere I always look forward to visiting, and everyone that I have taken here has been just as pleasantly surprised as I am every time I dine here.",

The owner and servers were super friendly and made me and my gf and I feel very welcome. You can tell that they love what they do in the way they talked about combining home cooked food with high quality ingredients.  I got the pork Katsu curry and my gf got the chicken Katsu. Trust me their food hits the spot. The fried pork and chicken were perfectly fried and not greasy at all, the curry was super flavorful, and the meal included so many yummy side dishes which complimented the food perfectly. They have the ultimate comfort food.  I can't wait to come back here!",

I might have overdone it with the thick cut pork cutlet, but it tasted so good! I was so full afterwards! The potato salad was also refreshing with bits of cucumber and apple. The fried squid legs were okay. Serving sizes run large here - I think I'll have to share with someone next time so I can try more sides and desserts!",

First off, the restaurant is a very small family owned restaurant and it's quite a drive away from the strip, in Southwest part of Las Vegas so it is definitely a hole in the wall! The workers are very nice and welcoming, I believe it was the owner's son who served our table. Pretty nice kid.   I ordered the chicken katsu dish which came with rice, miso soup, cabbage (vinegar dressing), and pickled onions. The dish was so well balanced together and tasty! The food was more than enough and I was super full from eating everything! We also checked in on Yelp and got a free potato salad, only one was allowed per table though. I also like the fact that you can make your own dipping sauce for the katsu - my favorite part. I highly recommend this place and would love to come again.",

    "text": "I went back to another business that has seemingly been forgotten by Yelpers, including yours truly. It should not remain overlooked.  I was in the mood for something comforting today. With plenty of fried goodness, the menu at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is pretty much Japanese comfort food. It's also not too far from some of my favorite sweets spots on Rainbow Blvd, which is always a good thing.  The first thing you do after ordering is load up your sauce bowl with sesame seeds from one of the hexagonal containers at the table, grab your pestle, and start grinding away. When you're satisfied with the amount of sesame powder, ladle katsu sauce from the other table and stir (probably with chopsticks). Eat this mixture with your katsu, or just nibble on it while waiting for whatever else you've ordered.  Takoyaki ($5): best rendition I've had yet. These morsels are served hot but not scalding hot, and they has that crispy exterior, soft interior, and chewy yet tender octopus. The bonito flakes and the creamy and sweet sauces complete the delicious flavor profile.  Agedashi Tofu ($4): my friend's pick from the several side dishes. Nice soft tofu and miso broth, but the skin is overly chewy. Note that it's not straightforward to share this dish because it's one big cube of tofu.  Hire Katsu ($13): a nice portion of breaded, fried pork tenderloin, served with miso soup, rice, thinly shredded cabbage with what seemed like a ponzu sauce, a dab of wasabi, and some pickled pearl onions. The katsu itself is a bit bland, but it's obviously meant to be eaten with the sauce and sides and contributes all the meatiness and crunch that you could want in that comprehensive mouthful. The cabbage was refreshing and the ponzu was so useful. I missed that in my first visit because the donburi lacks it entirely. It's a great entree for a big lunch or as part of dinner.  My friend is already planning to go back to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi tomorrow, and I'm sure I'll be around significantly more often. It's an excellent katsu restaurant and is worth the drive even without its proximity to some of my other frequent stops.",

The karaage and the gyoza. The karaage was okay. I've had better but the chicken was still quite juicy. I really like the gyoza though. Might be because of the sauce. The soy sauce had some yuzu flavor to it which really brought out the gyoza. Not to mention that the gyoza had a light skin and a good stuffing.   I had the tonkatsu pork and shrimp. You are given all the sauce ingredients like the sesame and the grinder on the table. Personally, part of the fun is to be able to grind the sesame itself and I always feel like it makes it legit when you have the sesame seeds to grind for Tonkatsu places. With that said, it was a big portion for a good pricing. You are given two pork(that are already cut for you) and 2 big shrimps. I personally thought the shrimp was really good, might be even better than the pork in fact. They fried it to perfection with the panko and it was the perfect proportion of the skin and the big fat shrimp.   Service was pretty good. The server actually had a mishap with our order and she gave us the appetizer as an apology.",

All the food packs lots of flavor and the customer service is great - the owner of the restaurant is the sweetest lady ever! Some must-try's include their deep-fried spam musubi special, the donburi, and their rosu (thicker cut of pork) katsu curry which is my personal favorite - comes with a side salad and some miso soup.  The only things that keep me from giving the place 5 stars are:  1. Irregular hours (only open for dinner, I want to be able to eat your food at least for lunch or dinner, but that's beyond my control) 2. It gets almost unbearably hot to eat in there during the summertime. I'm not sure if their AC unit was just broken that time I went, but hopefully the issue is resolved with the incoming hot weather. 3. Tiny restaurant - don't like to wait to eat if they are busy.   Hopefully one day when Jones finally connects with Blue Diamond, maybe they will get more attention. They definitely deserve it!",

This is hands down the best tonkatsu I have eaten in my life!  The pork, chicken, and shrimp are perfectly cooked. The breading is perfectly fried and crispy, not greasy at all.  Every table has a condiment tray with two mini mortars and pestles in which you grind white sesame seeds and add tonkatsu sauce.  What a perfect touch!  They even give you rakkyo (pickled scallions) with your dish.  Very authentic.  The miso soup was delicious, too.  The finely shaved mountain of cabbage with a light and delicate yuzu (Japanese citrus) dressing is a perfect accompaniment to the meat.  If you have room, try one of the homemade desserts, beautifully prepared by Kiyoshi's wife.  Today, I had the raspberry yuzu panecotta, and it was the bomb!  In addition to delicious food, the restaurant is decorated with homey Japanese touches that make it a very comfortable place to enjoy one of the tastiest comfort foods of Japan--warm woods, good luck cats, and homey framed artwork.  This is the perfect example of a restaurant that has chosen one dish to excel in.  Small menu with every choice a winner.  The piece de la resistance?  A friendly proprietor and excellent service!  Now if only Kiyoshi would open an L.A. outpost!",

He explained it as a Japanese / Hawaiian spot, so I was immediately interested!  Wasn't quite sure when they were opening as I was just eavesdropping on a conversation, but as soon as it popped up on my yelp \"nearby,\" I had to go and check it out!  My daughter and I went this past Sunday night.   The decor is awesome with Japanese accents.  I really thought he did a great job. The owner explained that his mom helped with some of the cranes and such. It's clear they put a lot of thought into the decor. I love it!    We ordered the Katsu curry and asked for chicken instead of pork, as I grew up on chicken Katsu!  My daughter also wanted the edamame and I ordered shishito peppers to start. The peppers were a little crispier than I am used to, but they were delicious.  I would just like to see them cooked down just a little more next time. Delicious, none the less.  My daughter said the edamame was great.   As we waited for the entree he taught us how to make our own Katsu dipping sauce with sesame seeds. How cool!   The Katsu arrived quickly after we finished making our sauce. The curry was perfect, exactly what we would expect at any Japanese / Hawaiian restaurant. The crispy Katsu breading was great! Crispy and tasty. The chicken was juicy and not over cooked.  We really loved it!   The dipping sauce is the best Katsu sauce I've ever had, which is crazy because I have been eating chicken Katsu all of my life!!!   We left full and very happy. We almost went there for dinner on Monday night (the very next evening) but my daughter decided to go tonight instead (Tuesday) with her friend.   Love this place! Will definitely be back and I'm sure we will be regulars. Yummy!!",

We've had their beef tataki multiple times and just tried their chicken karaage, both of them are excellent.",

    "text": "Krazy for Katsu There are some days where comfort food makes everything better.  I was not in the mood for meatloaf or some heavy fried chicken, even though I was dying for fried food.  On the way home, we stumbled on a small eatery called Tonkatsu Kiyoshi on Jones and Robindale.  Tonkatsu sounded wonderful for dinner.  Crispy, marinated, fried pork was just the thing to make my frown turn upside-down.  Upon entering the small eatery, there are about 3 tables that seat up to six people, and a nice, large counter seating 5.  We sat at the counter and was greeted by a very nice gentleman who explained the menu layout.  The menu is very simple--it's katsu, either chicken, salmon, thick cut pork, or pork tenderloin, ebi furai, curry combos, and apps.  The appetizers are the typical karaage, cucumber and krab meat salad, seared beef with onions and ponzu, and edamame.  We ordered karaage, krab meat salad, and seared beef.  Before the food arrived, the server explained their sauce tray seated in front of us.  There is a container of sesame seeds, one of katsu sauce, hot pepper, salt, pepper, and soy sauce.  We were told to put sesame in the grinding bowl that doubles as our dipping sauce bowl, and to grind the sesame seeds to a powder.  It was quite fun grinding up the sesame seeds and taking in the scent of the nutty oils releasing in the bowl.  We mixed in the katsu sauce and some hot pepper with our chopsticks, then awaited the main course.  The apps came out quickly.  First up was the cucumber salad with krab meat.  It's sweet and tangy from the vinegar, balancing the sweetness of the shredded krab stick.  The cucumber was a nice, crunchy, and fresh element to the app.  It also acts as a great palate cleanser.  For $5 you get a ton of salad.  I almost ate the whole bowl without sharing with my husband.  The next app that arrived was the seared beef with onions and ponzu.  We were told that some people like to roll the onions into the meat then dip, which I tried.  I added in the radish (on the right) and some chives into the sauce, rolled the raw white onions in the meat, then dipped.  It was delicious and very cold, which was refreshing.  The meat was good quality and seared beautifully.  If there is anything in the world I love, it is fried chicken or karaage, and this eatery makes the lightest, crispiest, and most flavorful karaage I have tried in Vegas.  They marinate the meat in mirin, soy, and other ingredients for a day or two, then they lightly batter it with seasoned rice flour and serve with a vinaigrette salad and lemon.  I squeezed lemon over the chicken, gently dropped soy on each piece, and took a bite.  The crispy, light exterior was just heaven.  The salad on the side balanced the hot fried chicken pieces, providing tasty, cool relief from the hot and crispy chicken.    With a burst of cherry tomato in my mouth mixed in with the salad, this could be a great lunch dish on its own.  Just lovely.  After all those appetizers came the combination plate that I ordered -- fried shrimp with tenderloin katsu.  It's served with Rokkyo (Japanese pickled onions), miso soup, hot rice, and ponzu for the cabbage.  The katsu is served on this awesome metal rack to keep all sides crispy.  The katsu was juicy and crispy, with that lovely coating that wasn't too thick.  The shrimp (ebi furai) was delicious.  I love ebi furai and they make it very well here.  With the cabbage covered in ponzu sauce, some Rokkyo to cut through the richness of the katsu, and some hot rice to compliment everything else, I didn't look up once through the entire meal.  It was just so much fun to dip in the katsu sesame sauce and then reach for rice, then drink some miso to balance everything.  In the end, I raped my plate of all its parts and tapped my tummy in approval.  But what--we cannot end a meal on entree alone.  A light, sweet dessert is required here, and what better to eat than a cream puff.  A cream puff that is made fresh, powdered with sugar, and filled generously with a whipped cream made in-house was the perfect way to end this \"ichiban\" meal.  The cream was silky and had just the right sweetness, with a puff that wasn't crispy as it was chewy and light.  Perfect ending to my day, indeed.  After paying the good man $56 for 2 drinks. 2 entress, 3 apps, and 2 desserts, my husband and I shuffled our cartoon-like full bellies into the car and headed home to hibernate.  I love places that have simple menus, provide good food and service, are very clean, and are priced well.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi hits all those marks, which only means that they are on my go-to list when I am in dire need of a katsu, karaage, or ebi furai mix.  Thank you, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, for making my day brighter and my belly full.",

Katsu Curry ($12): Pork Tenderloin Katsu with Curry Rice. Pork was PERFECT! Juicy, tender insides with a crunchy yet soft breading on the outside!  I really don't know how else it could be BETTER...seriously, it was as good as it gets for simple Katsu!  The Curry itself had much more FLAVOR than the \"other\" Japanese curry house as well.  The other tasted like a boring gravy that I had to sprinkle tons of seasoning into  for something to really stand out.  This one is good on its own, but even better with a little bit of love!    Also tried the Melon Cream Soda Float ($3.25). Nice change of pace! The soda itself is super sweet esp combining with the ice cream, but it is pretty tasty overall.  Give it a shot if you need to calm a sweet tooth!  I thought prices were fair and the portions were pretty large.  If this place was in Chinatown, it would be packed!  See you next time!  Pics :",

    "text": "Another local style restaurant near my house! I am loving the ninth island. Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is strictly all about the self described Tonkatsu. One of the many local kine food grew up on. Besides the fact always been fan of any kind of breading that uses panko. It done right nothing better then light crispy golden brown crust on the outside and juicy hot meat on the inside. At Tonkatsu Kiyoshi they do fabulous job comes too the Tonkatsu.   It was my first time so on this visit only got too try the pork katsu although they have other proteins from shrimp, beef, and chicken. Most of the entree comes with rice, couple pieces of garlic (makes no sense, I never asked so sure has its compliment), and miso soup. The house miso soup was good. I liked the fact that it was on the hearty side with decent amount of diced tofu and seaweed. I heard about the Curry sauce from friend recommendation. So I got the Katsu Curry try the best of both worlds. Japanese Curry reminded me of the curry houses back home in Hawaii. Especially the fact that in curry comes with big diced cuts of potatoes and carrots. Think traditional Japanese style just the curry then you add extra items or other curry places around town that just the norm. I have no problem with just pointing out difference. The curry sauce base its solid. Other places around town the base curry is better but here curry sauce does have its flavor all its own. Its more darker in depth not more on the yellow/orange color use too. The tonkatsu was ON point crispy golden brown and hot moist on the inside. Portion size is LOCAL style. Very reasonable price too. One plate between half filled with rice, nice size portion of katsu, and my case curry sauce. Miso soup that full full lunch.   It small restaurant easily hold under hundred peeps. I like the bar action up front holds around ten seats. They have tables on both sides up front. The decor is simple couple of japanese art work on the walls. It just open so for sure has that brand new restaurant smell too it. Couple other business around it that not quite open yet so don't let the lack of action around mislead you. It tucked in the back of mini shopping mall so easy pass it. Open for both lunch and dinner. Sure plan on coming back trying more of the menu items.",

I really enjoyed the breading. Our meal also came with soup, salad, and of course rice.  There's sesame seeds to grind in a bowl.

I can always have Tonkatsu for any meal; it's comfort food for me and if you go to Japan, they make it so light and crunchy, you almost can't believe that its fried.  Almost...  But alas, we're not in Japan, and for the most part, Tonkatsu here is a heavier, oilier version of the original, and if you're lucky, the Pork doesn't taste like your belt.. or is as thin...  And then Tonkatsu Kiyoshi come into town, and all is good.  Located in an area that no matter where you live, takes a butt long time to get to, since it's in a residential-ish area with rudimentary access (Vegas, could you hurry up and upgrade the road conditions already)?  I was a little trepidatious at first, I really didn't want to go if it was just another L&L BBQ or Ross J's... (no offense)...  The venue is not big, under 40 seats total with a great counter for single dining; the interior is pretty bare bones, but understandable considering its location and casual service.    Its always a good sign to see Sesame and Tonkatsu sauce on the table with your own mini mortar and pestle.  You grind the Sesame seeds and then pour the tart sauce over to create a goopy concoction to dip your flaky fried Tonkatsu, I prefer to add a little hot mustard to give it a kick!  As mini starters, we ordered the Crab and Cucumber Salad and the House made Potato Salad.  I loved how the dishes came in ceramics authentic to a Japanese Tonkatsu House, and looked forward how the dishes would taste.  The House Potato Salad had Cucumber, Apple and Japanese Mayonnaise (Kewpie).  Although it was good, It was a little watered down and not as creamy as I was expecting.  But then again, with all the fried food that was about to be consumed, maybe creamy was overkill...  So the next dish we ordered was the Crab Cucumber Salad.... which to my disappointment, was not with real Crab but with Crab Sticks or 'Kamaboko' - basically imitation crab made from white fish meat.  But, for $3.50, I should have realized that the fact that this wan't going to be a real Crab dish.  Oddly enough, there was a disproportionate amount of Crabstick in comparison to Cucumber.  It was an odd dish for sure.  As for the Tonkatsu, I got the combination set with  two pieces of Tenderloin (Hire) and two Fried Shrimp.  You have two types of cuts to choose from: Hire and Rosu (Thick cut Pork Loin).  Usually I get the Hire; it's a softer cut that comes installer, thinner pieces.  If I'm really hungry, I'll get the Rosu which is thicker and bigger but a little tougher to chew.  I was thoroughly amazed at how soft the Tonkutsu was, it was fried perfectly too, not greasy in the least, it was very light and easy to eat.  It was a authentic as I could ever have imagined, like being back in Japan.  The Miso Soup was the real thing as well, and the Rice was spot on (yes, you can fuck up Rice...)  The Fried Shimp was ok, again fried to perfection but I wasn't sure about the freshness of the Shrimp.  I would get it again.  But all in all, its definitely worth going back to for the Hire Katsu.  And with a couple of combinations you can get as well as Katsu Curry, It's a place I can back again and again!  Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:           4 Ambience:  Ummm Service:       4.75",

    "text": "So glad I was able to try this restaurant. Great food, good service and good value!  If you are a fan of tonkatsu (deep fried pork cutlet), then you will love this place! Since in addition to a regular cut portion, you can get an extra thick cut tonkotsu. If pork is not your cup of tea, chicken and shrimp katsu are also available.  The katsu is expertly deep fried, nice and crunchy on the outside and not too oily. If you get the meal, the dressing for the cabbage salad is great! I am not sure if it is store policy, but the waiter offered to refill our rice and cabbage salad during our visit.  My combination chicken and shrimp katsu was only $14. Best of all, the meal is interactive since you get to prepare your own katsu dipping sauce by grinding sesame seeds and adding the desired amount of sauce. Definitely a place return to!",

    "text": "My little sister saw this on yelp a couple months ago. I have been meaning to come here since they have good ratings. It took me a while to come here. Every time I decided to go to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, it happened to be a Sunday. Haha Just my luck right? Luckily, this time it was a Thursday.   Parking is never an issue in Las Vegas. This location had their own parking lot. It was not pack at the time I went.  The atmosphere inside the store was very causal. I like that there was a Daruma good luck doll. I saw a bunch of those when I went to Hawaii so I thought they was cool that they had a huge one there. They have a \"bar\" seating area and 6 tables inside the restaurant. Five tables were seated but it didn't feel PACKED. The place is small with can hold a good amount of people without feeling crowded.   There was only one service and two people in the kitchen. The server was quiet for the most part. He would just take our order and it took him a while to refill our water. When I went to pay my bill, he was very friendly and joked around a little.  The food was the main reason why I rated this place 2 stars. I ordered the Tonkatsu Don. Although the slice of pork was thick, it was very dry. There was nothing special about that dish. We also order the Chicken Karaage which was $6. There was only 6 pieces of meat and they were pretty small. I can't believe I paid $1 per piece of chicken. There was nothing special about the Chicken Karaage either. I felt like I could live without it and regretted my order. We got the Melon Float as well which is a drink I could make on my own.   If you're looking for a very good Tonkatsu Don, I recommend going to I-Naba. The location of the restaurant is a little weird but I guarantee their food is good and very authentic! :)",

    "text": "My sister and I were debating between restaurants and finally settled on Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.  The potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.  The katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version.  The chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding. The katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.  Being that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal! The waitress saw me and came over to explain how it worked and got it started for me. She also had to open my bottle of Ramune for me =( A+ for service, but next time I come in I'll be pro!",

The cutlet is crisp, juicy, cooked perfectly, highly addictive, and will fill your tummy.  I like to either get the Pork/Ebi Shrimp combo or the Donburi.  For the Donburi you can switch out with the Hire or the Rosu or you can get chicken.  I try to always get pork since that is their logo ya know....  Not a fan of their beef tataki - if you want that go down the street to Soho.  But when it comes to Tonkatsu there's currently no other place in vegas that comes close and this place just happens to be down the street from me so i'll be a regular!",

    "text": "Honestly, I didn't even realize how hidden this place is for a restaurant with such a reputation. I pass by this intersection every day and didn't think twice about going by here until by recommendation from some classmates.  So I head down the street, park up front, and enter to find this seemingly simple designed eatery. Nothing grand. A simple bar. Maybe enough seats for 30? It's small. The menu itself is simple too! It's a front and back menu which focuses on mainly katsu. I was really curious at this point.  I order a chicken katsu at around $9 and my boyfriend the salmon/chicken katsu close to $14. It's a really good portion of food. You get a salad with dressing. Katsu fried in flakey japanese style breading that has a satisfying crisp. I think some Japanese pickles (which I didn't try) and a miso soup. The miso soup was a thoughtful touch. I could never finish a whole order by myself and I went here twice!  Overall, I ended up having a pocket in my heart for this place. The restaurant is simple, not because it doesn't put effort, but because their showcase is really their food. It has personality to it that is unique to Tonkatsu. Service has always been friendly there too like we're all just neighbors.  Note: I'm often a budget eater so $9 for chicken katsu was like, \"Eh..\" but after trying it, I say it's a reasonable price especially if comparing it to a $6.50 hawaiian bbq regular plate because you can account for the salad and miso soup...plus the breading of the chicken was delicious at this place. It definitely converted what I thought katsu should taste like.",

The miso soup had much more depth in comparison to others I've had before, and you can expect the portions to leave you feeling satisfied!  Also, I quite like the ambiance of this place. It feels authentic; it's not tacky, it's tasteful. I don't know what we were thinking at the time, but we decided to order the Azuki Bean ice cream even when we were super-stuffed. I think it may be red bean? I'm not entirely sure! The important detail of this is that, I don't usually like red bean ice cream but can honestly say that this ice cream was the perfect taste to end our meal. Convincing enough for ya?  Their sauce brings the katsu to perfection! I honestly wish I was skilled at grinding sesame seeds, because I think the sauce-to-seed ratio is essential in bringing out the ideal flavor. LOL.

I personally love their in-house Tonkatsu sauce and sesame seed combo where I can grind and flavor my own sauce.  Price: With the surrounding places nearby Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is on the pricer scale.
