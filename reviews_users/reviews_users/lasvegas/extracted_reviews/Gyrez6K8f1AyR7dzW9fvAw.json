You could tell in that restaurant that it was focusing more on food rather than quality in service, sadly it brings food down as well. Then there was Casanova. Casanova is the kind of restaurant that I would want every restaurant in the world to model after. Right when we walked in the hostess was friendly and acknowledge us without asking. Then we were seated and even though we had one waiter, all others pulled in once in a while to check how we were, I don't think I ever emptied my water is how attentive they were. The Casanova Fettuccine was amazing!! My husband got another which the sauce was a tad too heavy for me but it was still enjoyable. We really enjoyed our dinner it was a great experience overall. We came by Uber but if you drive I believe the Venitian has free parking.",

Our waiter instead of giving our party individual checks, he split the entire bill equally leaving each of us to pay more than we should have. Contacting management did no good. After calling 4x, and asking to speak to a manager I continually kept getting the same response that \"the manager was not there\" and they \"hadn't seen him\" and \"didn't know when he would return\"; I finally left my number for him to call back. The manager finally called back and after I explained the situation, instead of providing friendly customer service he proceeded to yell at me and degrade me that I didn't come \"earlier\". I told him I had been trying to call, but he continued to yell and scream. With his thick accent I could barely understand him. I asked him if the owner of the establishment could call me back and he said, \"the owners don't come here\". He continued to provide me with lie after lie, and would not help me all together. A fraud case has now been open with my credit card. So, if your in the area and want Italian, STAY CLEAR away. I wouldn't give this place a dime.",

Party of 6 tried 2 hummus platter appetizers... it came with enough hummus to fill 5 pita wraps but they only gave us 2 pita wraps cut into 6 miniature cuts per piece. Each portion was basically the size of tostito chip. The platter portions were small and we had nearly all the hummus remaining.  The complimentary bread was decent but the butter they served was frozen solid. It was like eating an icebutter sandwich. The spahagetti carbonara was the absolute showstopper. I have never tasted anything so disgusting in my entire life. It was basically disgusting cheese mashed with bacon combined with pasta. Ugh.  I thought it was nasty so I shared it with the group and everyone almost vomited. To seal the deal they made an issue with our splitting checks. They ended up charging us more than intended. The server argued with us and brought out his calculator while crunching the wrong numbers. I pointed out that it did not make sense and the server was offended we did not leave the premise. We ran through the calculations again and they refunded us the overcharged amount ... from the servers wallet. You have got to be joking.  Worst dining experience in Vegas. We probably got the worst draw this time, but will not be returning here based on the stated obstacles. All we wanted was a normal dinner.... not even asking for anything fancy.  It wasted a significant amount of our night time. Beware.",

If you're looking for something effortless and familiar after adventuring through some of Vegas' other, more exotic offering then this is your place. A lot of variety in the menu and it blends together Mediterranean and Italian food, so there are lots of choices. Service was quick and attentive and the wine list looked good (I only had one glass, but checked out the bottle offerings). Ambiance really isn't that great because it's inside the Venetian and tucked back in the shopping area. But, definitely worth trying if you're nearby and looking for a place that will definitely have something you'll enjoy.",

We all ordered different things off the menu which was good, since I got to try multiple dishes. I got the gnocchi which was good and also tried the Casanova fettuccini. The real show stopper was the carbonara. That was the best dish I tried there and it was one of the best carbonara dishes I've had. If you go here that is the dish you need and you won't be disappointed.   Service was good and quick. We reserved at least an hour and a half of our time for dinner and were in and out in less than an hour.",

The last time we were here for dinner, we were with another couple and we all enjoyed our meals.  On this occasion, we decided to have dinner here since we were going to a show at the Venetian Theater. Thanks to other Yelpers' advice, I purchased half price vouchers (for entrees only) from the half price tickets outlet (down the street @ Fashion Show Mall) prior to going to the Venetian.   I ordered the Linguine with clams and my wife ordered the Linguine Mare Nostrum...They came out in a timely manner and were very delicious! We haven't had a bad meal here yet and the service is good. Good casual Italian dining on the strip. Definitely good if you're craving good pasta, I'll for sure will be back...great place to people watch if you're sitting in the outside area!",

The young lady working the entrance was very nice and professional, and seated us very fast, however, once seated it was a while before we were greeted or asked what we wanted to drink. Once we ordered our drinks, someone came brought 2 out of 3 of the drinks that was order...I never received my drink. Once we ordered our food, we waited an extremely long time to get our food, considering others that were seated after us had their orders and halfway done with their meals. Long story short...be prepared to wait.   Also, the weird man lurking around the restaurant jumping from table to table, who I can only assume was the owner treated his staff pretty rudely bossing them around in front of the customers...not good.",

My husband had the turkey sandwich it was pretty delicious love the hummus. I wish we came here during dinner though because they had such a beautiful wine collection I am sure it would be nice to dine there.

We bought two 1/2 price meal vouchers from the 1/2 price ticket place on the strip and the voucher included any entree or pasta on the menu--WOW!    Drew ordered the new york strip and I ordered the lobster supreme.  The NY strip was cooked perfectly and the potatoes on the side were as well.  I can not say enough good things about the lobster supreme!  It had lobster, shrimp, linguini, tomatoes, and a creamy \"spicy\" sauce.  You may be a bit concerned when you read the spicy sauce description, but don't let it deter you!  I did not think it was even the slightest bit spicy.  When was the last time you ordered a fabulous steak and lobster meal that came out to a combined $38 (no appetizer, dessert, or drinks included; remember we had the 1/2 price vouchers)?!  My guess is never!    FYI:  I would 100% go back to Casanova even if I were paying full price.  It was that good!",

We stopped here because of the menu, and we are glad we did.  Service was exceptional. The wine list gives you plenty of choices. I chose a white wine from Sicily, and it was very good. My waiter recommended the Cadsanova Fetuccini. It was delicious. I almost licked the bowl. My wife loved it too.  Don't come here for the pizza. If you want pizza,walk to the other end of the mall to Grimaldi's, which is excellent.  The price was actually a lot lower than I expected, especially for a restaurant in Vegas at the Venetian.",

Both dishes were delicious, although for the price we thought it should've included a house salad in addition to the bread basket.

I might be a little bit spoiled with Italian food but cooking Italian is not rocket science.  1. Every table should have a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not in this place. I got 3 little slices of bread with a hotel pack of butter. Really?  2. As starter I ordered the beef carpaccio. That plate was way too long in the cooler. Part of the beef was already dried out. Capers must have been on sale. I could have filled a small jar with the remaining ones. The baby arugula had seen its best days. And the cheese on top was something but not parmegiano cheese.  3. As special they offered Penne alla Vodka. How disappointing a special could be. OK the pasta was cooked al dente. But that's about it. The diced bacon was also on sale. Not fresh at all. Must be one of those pre diced packages. Absolutely no flavor. I could barely smell any tomatoes. And to top it off they offer pre grated cheese. Seriously?!? Olive Garden could do a better job and I avoid that place anyway.   That place will go down the moment Trattoria Reggiano across will re-open. They are 300% better with everything. Freshness, service and ambience.   I give this place 2 stars because their wine was good and the staff is friendly.   But avoid the place if you are looking for authentic and fresh Italian food.  Oh yes and offering free desert for a yelp review?? Really?? That's probably how this place get its 4 star reviews.",

They seemed to sense how fragile we were feeling, and made sure to load us up with all the spicy condiments and glasses of ice-water we needed.

The waitress at the desk told me that they can make a lot of dishes vegetarian and we walked in with a hungry stomach at around 2:30 pm.   The waitress recommended \"eggplant musaka\" and we also chose the Gnocchi pasta.   We found that it was probably the best vegetarian Italian dishes we have tasted here in the US. I really recommend this especially to people who are of the impression that it is hard to find vegetarian options in Las Vegas.   The Manager was also really courteous and friendly. We would love to dine here the next if we visit Las Vegas in future.",

Carmelo is very knowledgeable and with the huge selection available he will certainly be able to find something you will love. My wife enjoyed the veal Ossobuco very much and i had The Branzino filets with sun dried tomatoes, couscous and white wine garlic butter sauce was really good. This would be good for a special occasion, romantic evening, date night or just when you want to treat yourself to an amazing meal.

I had high expectations, and they were exceeded on all accounts for this out-of-the-way gem among the shops along the canal! The restaurant ambience was great, made for a date-night to remember.  We went with a 5 course dinner, and started with the Beef Carpaccio appetizer which was so delicious, served with a thin Parmesan slice and wonderful capers.  The seafood salad was next, and the highlight of the meal for me, I never had such delicious and tender octopus and other seafood!  For the pasta dish I had the Gnocchi alla Sorrentina, and it was divine.  Very apparent the gnocchi was handmade, and it was as delicious as any that I've had in Italy. I had the Filet Au Poivre and my husband had the Lamb Chop Scottadito for the main course and both were cooked to perfection.  This was my husbands favorite dish, and he said it was one of the top steaks he ever had.  For dessert we had the classic Profiterole which lived up to the lofty expectations set by the preceding courses.   The service throughout was impeccable, and the sommelier provided great pairings based on on wine preferences.  All of this for much less than most fine-dining establishments on the strip.....if you want authentic Italian, go to Casanova tonight!",

My friends and I were in Las Vegas for a conference, and it was our last night so we wanted to celebrate by going somewhere nice. We made reservations prior to arriving, and got seated promptly on the patio area. While there was a good amount of the traffic within the Venetian, that did not take away from our experience.   For dinner, I splurged and got the Lamb Chops. The lamb was cooked perfectly, but I was not a fan of the whatever that seasoning was (I think the seasoning had pistachios in it, but not entirely sure). I found myself wanting more oomph and bursts of flavor. I do have to say that the rice pilaf was rather bland, but it somehow all worked as a dish.   Service was great and attentive! Overall, this is a solid Vegas restaurant! I'd definitely recommend it to others visiting (but you must get the deal!).",

    "text": "Before a show at the Palazzo Theatre, I stopped here for dinner.  The restaurant is along the walkway in the food court area of the Grand Canal Shops.  Given that, the dining is likely to be noisy because there is a lot of foot traffic going by.  That's also fun because you get to watch tourists as they walk by some wondering where the hell they are and where are they going.  I had a reservation for 5 PM and the restaurant was almost empty.  Within fifteen minutes, it was somewhat crowded as people filed in.  I was brought water and iced tea.  Warm bread soon followed the beverages.  I asked the person who took the order if it was possible to get a half order of the frito misto and the answer was no.  It's always a share dish so I passed on that and got the Caesar salad instead.  For the main course, I ordered the fettuccine Casanova.    When the Caesar salad came, the server ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The salad was a standard, good tasting Caesar with a good amount of cheese and some croutons, one of which was like a rock.  The fettuccine was very good.  Grated cheese was added to my taste.  There are mushrooms, bacon, chicken, cherry tomatoes, and some arugula in the pasta that has a light cream sauce.  I took my time with the pasta enjoying the flavors while watching the people go by.  For dessert, I got an affogato.  The espresso was very rich and the ice cream and coffee went together nicely.  Service was good.  The tables are close together.  I was OK for awhile because to my right was a small aisle for the servers and to my left was a wall.  Later, a family came in, and when they were seated, I could have eaten off the plate of the man right on the other side of the wall.  It was interesting listening to their conversation.  If you come here with someone else and care if people mind what you may say, don't speak in a normal voice.  Keep it low.  Altogether, a pleasant dinner with Strip pricing which I knew before I went.",

We ordered the apple wood bacon spinach salad, rigatoni salmon and peas and Fettuccine Casanova with special request to add lobster. Everything was unfortunately just mediocre. There is not much depth of flavor. Just kinda salty and bland. Disclaimer: We have had really great pasta elsewhere so we have very high expectations when it comes to our pasta. This just didn't cut it.",

Lol is there a headquarters Bc this guy has lost his damn mind thinking he could run a business with checking up on a table 4x if that? PLEASE feel free to send over that footage bc I recall having to wave around like 6x to get a \"server\" over to our table. Please cut the bs with that \"if u would've let me know I would've handled the situation\" bc if your cameras have Audio then u can CLEARLY state how unhappy & UNSATISFIED I was with the entire dinner. I even STOP you from rudely interrupting you & tell you \"can you stop interrupting me the customer is always right, or am I wrong?\" & YOU nodded ur head agreeing with me finally shutting up! Seriously, then I call asking for the managers name & you hang up on me.. you call that professional? You seriously shouldn't have a job. I really feel bad for the people you serve bc it's out hard earned money to have to throw it away to trash service at restaurants run by \"managers\" like yourself. & instead of being sincere & apologizing for the crap service you give this half ass fake \"apology\" then retract it by saying \"I'm sorry BUT\" like seriously? U are a very old grown man, start acting like it & stop trying to fight with people over the Internet bc CLEARLY you can't manage a restaurant. If you can't take criticism / or properly manage a restaurant please just retire. I wasn't the one who asked for a military discount btw & when u said there was NONE, NO ONE was upset mr. now u are just trying to make things up on the Internet to make ur case look better & that's so childish. YOU said \"it's fine we can give u a 10% discount on the house\" probably KNOWING how upset we were with our crap service. Mr. unknown name (since fellow YELPERS, this man REFUSED to disclose his name when I immediately called the restaurant to complain) either get your act together & LEARN how to run a restaurant bc the first thing you should've learned was #1 rule the customer is ALWAYS right or option #2 just retire bc sir, you are way TOO OLD to try arguing with me over the INTERNET & to be dishing these half ass \"apologies.\" So funny guys.",

I remembered cheesy all-you-eat buffets, pitiful looking people at slot machines, etc. So before we came, we arranged for a hotel without a casino and I yelped restaurants. This restaurant received good reviews, and it did not disappoint. The food and drinks were wonderful. The tacky people are still here, but in different form and this was a great place to people watch. Service was wonderful. I did get the impression that we would have a view of the gondoliers and the canal, but really this is a really great, people watching mall restaurant. Felt very comfortable here and the blackberry margarita was yum! My husband's linguini with clams was also wonderful. First few hours in Las Vegas. Still a strange place, but for the first time I am enjoying it.",

It feels homey, which is a heck of a feat considering it is in the middle of the Venetian.  Casanova blends nice Italian red sauce cuisine with pan-Mediterranean cuisine. My table got a Caesar salad, chicken kebabs and fried halloumi cheese. And all were executed with the easy care of a place around the corner from your house.  Definitely worth a visit if the other Venetian restaurants are full!",

They are located in the Canal shops, not too far from the food court.  The restaurant might not have the best ambiance due to their location and layout (probably the only thing keeping my review from 5 stars), but it is a hidden gem.  The food was delicious, and the service was exceptional. Also, the prices were very reasonable, with or without a discount. I had the ribeye, which was fantastic and my wife enjoyed her lobster dish.  I very highly recommend.",

It had broccoli and cauliflower in it, which I'm not used to. It was phenomenal. I burned my mouth cause I couldn't wait for it to cool to keep eating it. Then got the linguine mare and the fettuccine Casanova for the main dishes. The seafood was very fresh and both noodles tasted homemade.  Service was great. Didn't have to ask for any drink refills and constantly came back to see if we needed anything.   If you're staying in palazzo or Venetian I highly recommend this place. I also saw the ravioli on a neighboring table which had a cream sauce on it. I obviously didn't taste it (wish I could've!) but it looked fantastic.",

They have gluten free pasta (for a $2 upgrade) and it was great. It was a win win for me. The waiter and hostess were really nice and accommodating. I don't like my water with ice and the waiter asked me if I wanted iceless cold water or room temperature water. I definitely like my water room temperature and I appreciate him asking and getting it for me. The Restuarant has an open atmosphere, there are tables \"outside\" of the Restuarant where you can sit and people watch if you so choose. The food portion was generous. I got the penne vodka with shrimp ($8 up charge). You could also add chicken for a $7 up charge. My friend got the lasagna and she loved it, said the sauce had a little sweetness to it. She asked for extra sauce and they were glad to oblige. This was a great place and I would definitely come back.",

Our server was helpful and honest -- he warned us that the portions were large and recommended that for the two of us, we split an appetizer and entree rather than each ordering an entree. Always appreciate a honest server because it makes the experience so much more enjoyable rather than feeling bloated and overly stuffed after a meal. We ordered the burrata and arugula appetizer and the Linguine Mare Nostrum. The burrata was good, but the Linguine was definitely the star. They were very generous with the seafood, which tasted fresh. The sauce had the right amount of spiciness with a slight kick.",

My waiter walked to the back, talked to someone and came out telling me that comps only work for lunch and dinner, not breakfast. Uhhhhh......wth? Since when were comps allowed only for certain times. I called my host, my host told me that its weird, it's supposed to work anytime. I told him i wanna speak to the manager, and he showed me to someone named Maria, i told her the situation and she said they never got the comp from my host, and even if they did, it only works for lunch and dinner. I called my host again, and told my host to speak with Maria, Maria told my host they never received the voucher, guess what happens....... she then said their system is down so they never got it. So i told them you know what, forget it, i'll pay for it. So i paid.  I was waiting around 30 minutes for them, then she tells me their damn system was down? Really? It took that long? Such pathetic service, my host had to tell guest services to walk the voucher up to them.  NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN",

It wasn't a cheap meal ($3.50 for coffee and $4.00 for hot tea) but the food like the steak and eggs and the breakfast combo did taste pretty good.  Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of stars was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.  So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.  He swore it was and then walked off with it and poured another table some coffee.  Had to get another person to take that cup away and give me the real decaf.    If you don't have your carafes marked and/or don't know or understand the difference between regular and decaf coffee then you don't need to be a server.",

I was boring, a salad with chicken and hubby had the pasta Bolognese which was just excellent, pasta was perfect al dente and the sauce was so full of flavor. If you are looking for good solid Italian food, go here, or Trattoria Reggiano, which is nearby - a better value than Buddy V's and the food is just as good or better - and just skip the awful Canaletto.",

    "text": "Less-than-stellar lunch, saved only by the fact that I was not the one who paid for it.   Perhaps I am the one at fault for ordering a Salade Niccoise at an \"Italian\" restaurant, but I was desperate for lighter fare after spending only 2 days at the Venetian (seriously, you'll be hard-pressed to find non-pasta dishes at this place). At this point, I was ready to march outside and graze on the artificial gardens along the Strip. Even in my desperate state of mind, I found the execution to be a bit lackluster.   For $12.95, you get (straight from the menu): \"Red leaf lettuce, tuna, hardboiled eggs, green beans, potatoes, ripe tomato, black olives and anchovies, drizzled with champagne vinaigrette.\" I am pretty sure the tuna, black olives, and anchovies were placed on my plate fresh out of a can/jar. I wouldn't be surprised if the green beans and vinaigrette were made off-premises either.   Perhaps the only factor that keeps Casanova a step above food court fare is that their waiters have starched shirts and offer up freshly ground pepper. To be fair, nowhere do they claim that any of their ingredients are fresh, so there was no False advertising. However, if you're gonna live up to your namesake and sweep ladies off their feet, you gotta step up your game, Casanova.",

    "text": "While wandering around the Canal Shoppes we had passed by this place several times and finally decided to just give it a try, especially since they have \"outdoor\" seating where we can put our stroller to the side of the table easily.  The hostess was very friendly and even let us pick our table because they were not very busy at the time, we were promptly served water and bread for the table. The bread was okay on the first round but quite a bit harder crusted than what can be entirely edible, but the second basket they brought was perfect, the only complaint is that it is served with the little wrapped butter squares which are a pain to open and just aren't very classy. I decided to splurge and ordered the Ribeye, and my wife ordered a fettuccini (cant remember the name but it was like Carbonara's fettuccini based brother). The service was great and they were very prompt and friendly, and our waters were always filled.  I had ordered my steak Med-Rare, and it was served very well done, I have never sent food back before but because of the price this was the exception. they promptly replaced it with a perfectly cooked steak that was pretty tasty but not amazing, not what I expected for the price though I think the main issue is that I make a pretty mean steak and source my meat through butcher shops rather than grocery stores, so most high end steaks except dry aged ones are usually on par with what I make myself.  My wife's pasta was really good and again tasted just like a carbonara (which they also have on their menu) but with fettuccini instead. The restaurant has a nice feel to it, it seems upscale inside and their servers are well dressed but because they have a near food court mall location it keeps it casual and easy, It wasn't very busy for a Friday night so I'm guessing they either get later rushes than when we eat or that it isn't big competition to the nicer places within the same hotel. I probably wouldn't eat here again, just because it wasn't anything special, and even though the food and service were good the price was pretty high for what you get. Not that I would discourage any yelpers from giving it a try because it is tasty, and a bit cheaper than many of the places in the Canal Shoppes area.",

Exactly what you need after a night of drinking too much.   There was also only 7 of us yet they charged us for 8 entrees. Pay attention to your bill here!

    "text": "Casanova is an interesting Italian/Mediterranean combo - although the food may not be exactly the best I've ever had - it won me over with it's service and location.    Coming into Casanova, you're greeted pretty promptly by the host or hostess along with the many servers around.  It was fairly quiet when I visited in mid-day Saturday with about half the seats being taken.  The servers were all very friendly and super attentive - quick water refills and an eye to attention for your necessities.    The food choices were a mix of sandwiches, salads, pastas and entrees and the prices ranged from $10-$30.  I had the Fettuccine Casanova which was a moderately priced pasta that had a mixture of a lot of ingredients like mushrooms, chicken, bacon and more.  For the price, it seemed like a good value.  The pasta did seem a little chewy though and the taste seemed like it needed more of a kick with some spices or some herbs.  They also serve some basic bread/butter although it tasted a bit stale.    To find Casanova, go into the Venetian Canals and into the Canal Shoppes - past the Oxygen Bar and you should see Casanova before going around the bend.  It's a nice-looking restaurant with seats/tables jutting out into the walkway and a menu/host or hostess out front.    In the end, Casanova gets about a 3 1/2 stars from my experience - an okay food experience mixed with a great location, not-too-busy seating and terrific service.",

My friend's dish was the Penne Greek Style to which she added shrimp, and had no complaints about. I ordered a fettuccine with meat sauce and asparagus. The meat sauce was really hearty and delicious, while the small bites of asparagus added a nice fresh crunch. The pieces could have been slightly larger though. I added a meatball, which was not good at all. The inside was just warm, and there were weird hard bits in it.

Also, you are likely to sit right at the edge of the restaurant and the busy casino walk way, so people will bump into you as you are eating.  Staff: 4.5 stars. Hostess was a bit rude, but the remaining staff we encountered was nice and went above and beyond for us. Food: The food was good and had a good taste and seasoned well. We had Chicken Parm, Salads and Fettuccine type Carbonara. Everything was cooked good (pasta was al dente, so that's always a plus).  Overall: 4.5 stars. If you are looking for a quick sit down place with good food, come here. If you are expecting some Gordon Ramsay type dish, you are in the wrong place.",

Very tasty, not too heavy, great bolognese sauce and fresh meat. I could not stop eating but I have to save some room for the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection-medium rare as I like it.  And to top it off, the desert that is imported from Italy is just what one needs to end the great meal. Will be going back again and again and again.",

I ordered the filet which was high quality beef tenderloin, cooked exactly to my specification and covered in a delicious peppercorn sauce.  Others in the party ordered the chicken parmigiana and the Ossobuco, both of which I tasted and were also also quite tasty.  Carmelo, the manager and sommelier, was very knowledgeable and attentive.  He did a wonderful job in helping us with pairing the correct wines for our entree selections, further enhancing our culinary experience.  We are Las Vegas locals so we will certainly be coming back and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

It isn't even the fault of the servers, but with the management who seem to have a bad attitude. Most recently we stopped in for breakfast and asked if our vegan friend could bring in a sandwich from Subway. The manager told us that they had their own vegetarian sandwich, but reluctantly let her bring in the Subway since the restaurant was 80% empty at 8 AM on Sunday anyway. Last time, we were left waiting for quite a while despite having reservations. I remember the manager at that time being awful as well!  The food isn't even that great anyway. I remember the pasta was alright, but nothing particularly memorable. Definitely pass this place up for breakfast - $15 for steak and eggs with frozen hash browns. I should have just gone to McDonalds!",

It was on a bed of linguine which I didn't like because I'm not a pasta lover. It would've been better with some mashed potatoes! For dessert, we had a very scrumptious Tiramisu. It tasted housemaid!

I had my hungry 11 yr old and Hangry wifey since we just drove from Cali. We were lucky to get a table immediately. As soon as we got our drinks I noticed the front having to make folks wait; take later time reservations... etc  I ordered the lobster ravioli, and got a crab cake. It was excellent and surpassed my expectations to be honest. My wife got salmon rigatoni with peas. She ate the whole thing and said it was bomb. (Shes picky)My autistic 11 year old ate every bite of his penne marinara and made a little bit of a mess but the staff there was very cool and attentive. He's even more picky as one can imagine. It took 20 minutes to get our entrees on a busy night which I was very impressed with. Our drinks were very well made and not weak.  I will definitely come back again.",

My cousin order the mushroom raviolis and they ended up bringing an order of Mussels to her.  She insisted on eating the mussels and urged them to not make her the mushroom raviolis, but they didn't listen, they brought her an order and didn't charge her for them.    I had the Fettuchinni (I know that is spelled wrong) Casanova.  It had chunks of chicken, grape tomatoes and bacon in a light wine/butter sauce.  It was very good.  the pasta was perfect!   Everything that everyone ordered looked amazing and no one complained.  we also had the calimari as an appetizer.  It was fried perfectly! I could have eaten the whole order by myself!

The veal was really tender, although perhaps the lemon sauce was slightly overpowering. The fettuccine Casanova had very good flavor and the extra sauce at the bottom added taste to every single bite. Finally, the seafood flatbread came exactly as expected in terms of seafood taste blending with cheese and bread, however the volume of the flatbread made it very filling. All around a wonderful place for dinner.",

What really completely ruined the experience was the brast rudeness we experienced from the server. Miguel Angel should not be in the service industry, I have never felt so disrespected by a low level server. He epitomizes everything wrong with the self entitled servers we see nowadays.

It was fantastic, almost as good as my mother makes!!! Being that it was in a mall like setting, the ambiance was still very good (a few steps away and you can take an indoor gondola ride with a singing gondoleer).

We all must had waited around 30 minutes to get food after ordering.  The table next to us didn't even get a menu for ten minutes.    I'm gluten free so my boyfriend and I stopped here because I was excited about their gluten free pasta options.  When I ordered it, the waiter warned me it would take at least 25 minutes to cook so I thanked him and got the chicken kabob instead.  Our food still took over 30 min!  Luckily we enjoyed each other's company and the food ended up being really good.  I saw the staff running around the whole time not being effective.  They couldn't prioritize.  One guy was tending tables and another just folding a huge stack of napkins.  Then the waiter came to us (party of two) with four salads.  I told him it's not ours and he insisted it was and put it in my face.  I said \"No salads!\" three times then something clicked in him that made him realize it was the wrong table... Why would we have two salads each??  Besides service this place is really good.  Just don't expect to be there for less than an hour even if only five tables are filled.",

Fritto Misto: deep fried calamari and shrimp, asparagus and artichokes served with a spicy marinara and lemon aioli. I enjoyed this: lightly fried, huge shrimps, tender calamari.

The sauce was very flavorful. I'd order this again.   Fettuccini Casanova: cherry tomatoes, arugula, shitaki mushrooms, chicken and bacon tossed in a light cream sauce. I loved this. Pasta cooked al dente, not heavy at all, the tomatoes added a burst of flavor and the bacon added just the right amount of saltiness.   Lobster Supreme: seared lobster tail, cherry tomatoes, green onions, shrimp all tossed in a garlic sauce. I didn't try this but everyone that did enjoyed it!",

Last time I got seafood pasta and it was decadent, attaching a pic! My other favorites are the seafood salad which works as an appetizer and this wine I had to ask the name of - \"capezana barco reale\". If you're on the strip and looking for some great food and atmosphere, this spot at the Venetian is always a good choice",

This was ok. 3/5  Moussaka: Super thin layers of eggplant with ricotta cheese, mozzarella and tomato sauce in between layers and then baked. It's a very hot dish and really delicious. 4.5/5  Grilled New York Steak: I was craving for a huge chunk of meat. I had to cut around lots of fat. This was a delicious piece of meat but I was not satisfied. 3/5  It's not a bad place. It's just a typical Vegas hotel/casino restaurant where you don't really get the most value for your moolah.",

I was told it was one of the best deals on the strip so I decided to check it out.  Was in town for a conference and it seemed so were alot of other people.   I got there around 8:30 and asked for a table and was seated within 5 minutes.   It appeared they were slighty understaffed, it took about 10 minutes before my waiter came by to take my order, however when he did, he said \"let me get you a water\"  and I said I was ready to order and he was insisting on the water first.   Few mins later,  he comes back and I place my order.   I ordered the lamb chops scottadito normally priced at $35.   When I got my order,  it was poorly plated , and the portions were a little small.  I'm sure this place is alot better when they're not rushing to get everything cooked and the wait staff isn't over whelmed but this visit was mediocre at best.",

    "text": "Date of visit: 4/18/2015  I was panicking a little bit before our Vegas trip when I realized that I hadn't schedule a group birthday dinner for 17 people. Knowing that no one can really hate Italian food I decided that Casanova would be a good option as it was within walking distance of TI and they took reservations for 17 people.  On the day of dinner, we decided to leave a little early because I needed a shawl and we wanted to make sure we weren't late. Unfortunately, they're not listed on any of the signs, so we got all turned around. Luckily Scotty came to save us and we were seated. There were two other large groups (10+ people each), so I had a bad feeling about the service that would be provided. My bad feeling turned into actual poor service as we were promptly served water and then ignored for the next 10 minutes.  After flagging down the waiter who served us water twice, the manager (I think?) finally came out with a pen and paper and took our order. Some people in our party were a little worried because they had a show to get to, but the food came out with 20 minutes for them to spare.  Emy: Caesar Salad, Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken. The salad was not very good as the dressing was pretty watery. However, compared to the junk we had been eating the whole weekend, it was nice to have some greens to eat. My pasta tasted like pasta I could make at home and the chicken was awful. It was very dry and tasteless. I gave the leftovers to Issac to eat.  Cam: Gnocchi with Chicken. The gnocchi was not very good and Cam had the same issue as me with the chicken. There were also mozzarella balls mixed with the gnocchi, which were an unpleasant surprise when you can't really see what you're eating.  Smack and Diella asked the server to stick a candle in the tiramisu for me, and they were very nice about that. However, I like the tiramisu at Cafe Bella Italia much better.  Overall, Casanova was not the best experience in terms of food or service. The quality of food did not match up to the price. Cam and I paid about $60 for our meal and that didn't even include wine. Unfortunately, this is definitely not someplace I will come back to.",

The pasta was perfectly al dente. The scallops, shrimp, clams and mussels were fresh. Shrimp and scallop good size. Nice generous portions but not overly huge. Red tomato sauce was a little spicy and delicious! Hubby ordered the lasagna ($16) which was also tasty and generous portion. The pricing of our dishes was very reasonable for the excellent quality of ingredients especially given the location. Neighboring Italian restaurants in the same shopping areA were charging about twice as much per plate!  They even allow charge to room if staying at Venetian! The server was attentive and courteous. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the tables were located close together and it was a little noisy from shoppers passing.",

We shared some salads, but the highlights were the great food and even better service. I had a fabulous veal piccata - lemony, delightful and incredibly with mashed potatoes that were flavorful and thick.  The meal was so good that came back the following evening for the same dinner.

But this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I seated my napkin was a bit crumbled and there where some unused packets of syrup. (packets, really?)  It was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.  Basically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.  So it get's 1 star for less than minimum cleanliness required.",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking for a nice (but not crazy expensive) place for Italian food in the Venetian and came upon this place. Cassanova is located on the edge of the food court which is a little distracting.  There were 4 of us and we were immediately seated. We ordered cheese ravioli (good, but nothing ), lobster ravioli (this was very good & it actually had visible chunks of lobster inside the ravioli as well as shrimp in the sauce), pasta cassanova (light with a creme sauce I didn't actually try this one), & the spaghetti and meatballs (also didnt try but my friend liked it).  Service was SUPER fast, we probably only took ~45 min for our whole meal!) Omar was super nice & the whole staff was very attentive. The hostess was nice about taking our picture & even moved around for better lighting.  Overall, one star minused because of the location, not their fault but they might consider putting up partitions between the rest of the mall once they get a solid following, mall noise while eating takes away from the ambiance!  Other than that I'd come back, its a nice Italian restaurant for those who dont wanna spend $40 per person for one dish :)",

Otherwise the waiter didn't acknowledge us most of the time, the food came out wrong, we waited about 25 min for our order which is ridiculous for 4 pastas & a restaurant with about 30 tables. When we asked to speak to the manager he took our complaint as a joke. We will never return & I don't recommend it either unless you don't mind putting up with that crap.",

I was looking for something in the Venetian that might be fast to eat, not too fancy and somewhat healthy choices. I went here because it said Mediterranean and Italian. The menu was heavily Italian, but I went for the Baked Sea Bass Mediterranean style. It was yummy. The fish was prepared with oil, tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. It was laid over a bunch of very crisp asparagus. The potatoes that it was served with were forgettable, but the fish and vegetables were really good. Being from Boston, I don't usually eat fish away from home, but I liked the preparation and it was cooked well. I was given the hotel butter, as noted in other reviews, but I thought the bread they served was tasty. I got espresso and a cannoli to finish. The cannoli was crisp and the filling was OK. Why it was served with whipped cream is a mystery. The service was attentive and fast. If you want a fast meal without having to eat the fast food at the food court- this was a decent choice.",

The whole experience and atmosphere was first class. I started the evening with my favorite cocktail a Negroni and it was well balanced and delicious. Then I ordered a dozen oysters, these were fresh,  salty and sweet Washington coast oysters that are the best love boosters on the planet. I then had the Cioppino which was stock full of lobster, fish, mussels, clams, squid, baby octopus and scallops. OMG I was in heaven to have found this place as the wait staff gave impeccable service. My girlfriend loved it and needless to say my night ended with a bang.

I had to peel the crepe off of the ham because it was crunchy and tasted like cold egg batter. I'm not sure if the food is made somewhere else, my husband said it tastes like bad room service food. This place may be good for dinner but I advise against breakfast.",

    "text": "Casanova Ristorante is conveniently located in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes featuring Mediterranean/Italian style cuisine. The dishes are prepared by Chef German Castellano and served by an attentive friendly staff in a casual atmosphere. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  On a recent visit we enjoyed a Greek Salad followed by a Penne Greek style pasta and Cioppino. The Penne Greek style is a delicious pasta dish with roasted garlic, mushrooms, spinach, sundried tomato, caramelized onions, feta cheese, kalamata olives, marinara sauce and pine nuts. The Cioppino was a generous portion of lobster, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and fish served with grilled bread. The Cioppino is a meal in itself, especially if you opt for a nice glass of wine to accompany it. All three dishes were prepared and presented very well.  I suggest you make it a family affair and enjoy a casual lunch or dinner, celebrate a special occasion with friends or share a glass of wine with your love during a romantic dinner for two. Casanova has something for every taste.",

This was the ideal escape from the hotel vibe and the venue had a  touch of rustic meets neo-classic elements featuring two beautiful black chandeliers in the main dining area.  I had the ultimate pleasure to enjoy the Casanova Saganaki with a mild but pleasingly tart lemon zest that is a twoust in the traditional dish. The restaurant has a beautiful selection of wine featuring a wide selection of Italian wines to complement the Italian specialties of both North and southern regions of Italy. I will definitely return!!",

All of us ordered different dishes (what I remember): 2 chicken parmigiana, grilled salmon, chicken and fries for kids, grilled shrimp, frito misto, tuna and lobster supreme and whatever else. Rated only 3 stars because of the service. I personally like my dish a lot and so did the rest, except the person with the lobster supreme just because it was very very salty, more than what it needed to be. Made the comment to the server and they simply said okay. Didn't ask to fix it. Location is right next to the gondolas so it's quite nice, very quiet and peaceful ambience for those wanting to enjoy a nice dinner (my kids sat quietly so that was a plus) and the bread kept them busy while we waited for our food. The food would definitely bring me back, not so sure about the service. And yes the person ate the meal by force after squeezing about 6 lemons to try to even out salty flavor. Wish they would have taken a different attitude towards not caring.",

Beautiful ambience, authentic and delicious food and great service! What more could you ask for? We started with the fresh oysters which were so flavorful and the perfect combination of briny and sweet. Then we had the Greek pasta and Kale ravioli. Both unique and very flavorful. The Branzino reminded me of something I had eaten while near the coast of Sicily- The cous cous was cooked perfectly and complimented the fish perfectly. The Cioppino was a very generous serving of fresh seafood and the broth was full of flavor and paired perfectly with the Chianti Classico that our server assisted us in selecting. To finish our meal our server went to a gelato stand a few spots over to get us the particular kind we requested because the restaurant didn't carry it. Talk about good service! Ironically while we were eating we heard a man who was on vacation tell the manager that this was the fifth time he was been there this week. Guess we're not the only ones who can't wait to go back.",

I wish it came with some greens zucchini or something because I got tired of the same taste halfway through. I wish there were more mushrooms in it as well. Still, it was a pretty good dish.

    "text": "I was staying at the Venetian and was hoping to find a reasonably priced Italian option with good quality and this place seemed like a nice fit.  I arrived ~ 8:30 pm on  Wednesday and was promptly seated.  I was seated outside of the restaurant proper so there was a decent amount of ambient mall noise, but it was not overwhelmingly loud here.  There was some background music playing as well that was barely audible.  I started out with the burrata with arugula which was disappointing.  There were two thin slices of tomatoes that were devoid of flavor and other than the taste of the cheese, the salad was bland.  The mozzarella cheese was creamy and tasty, but there was not sufficient balsamic reduction to add some complexity.  While I was waiting for my entree, I munched on the bread which had a burnt crust which gave a bitter taste and the bread was not warm (room temperature).  The butter was foil wrapped in those individual packets but at least it was soft in texture and easy to spread.  For my entree, I ordered the lobster supreme which is a pan seared lobster tail with shrimp on a bed of linguini.  This dish was pretty good with some minor flaws however.  The lobster was a little overcooked and it was difficult to pry the meat off of the shell since they did not provide me with one of those tiny lobster forks.  For the most part, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, but two pieces were overcooked.  The pasta was el dente and the tomato based sauce was very yummy.  This was the best part of the meal and the portion was decent sized.  I got a free cannoli dessert because I filled out a Yelp review.  The dessert was pretty disappointing and not that tasty.  First of all the pastry was rock hard and impossible to eat using a spoon.  I had to ask for a knife to cut the pastry into bite-sized pieces. The dessert had a weird chalky texture.  Service was good as my waiter was friendly.  Overall it cost $60 for the appetizer, entree, and free dessert.  I expected more in terms of quality given the abundance of good eating options around.",

    "text": "I had a delicious lunch here today - I arrived right at the time the kitchen changes over from Breakfast to Lunch menu, with associated cleaning to be done. So I was advised it would be 10 minutes before the waiter could take my order. I was irritated by this, but hung around anyway. In the meantime, the waiter brought me my drink and then (as promised) before 10 minutes had passed he came back to take my order - a Greek Salad. He brought out a basket of complementary warm bread (very nice) and the salad followed soon after. It was totally delicious. Fresh ingredients, nicely presented and a good balance of flavours. Service is attentive and very pleasant. The location has potential to be noisy as it's right on the Grand Canal walkway, so if you want a quiet table, you could probably request one \"indoors\" nearer the back. Lunch was enjoyable, thank you.",

    "text": "Definitely a 5 star from my family! Great service and amazing food!  Thanks to my fellow yelpers for their recommendation!  This restaurant is tucked amongst the Canal Shops inside the Venetian, and It's very small and quant.  If your looking for a romantic, secluded restaurant, this is not your place, but is more open, lighted and fun.    My husband, our daughter and myself had made reservations for 7:30.  My daughter and I had been shopping and my husband was at a conference.  My daughter and I arrived at 7:30 and they kindly seated us without him..  Unfortunately my husband was delayed and didn't get there until 8:00, but they were very kind about it and never gave us a hard time (after I kept apologizing for his late arrival).  They just kept bringing out more drinks and delicious bread.  Our daughter had a glass of the house wine and I had the special margarita!  It was strong, but well worth it and help soak up the delicious soft and hot bread!    We started with the Fritto Misto appetizer.  It was just your basic fried shrimp and calamari, but still pretty tasty.  We ordered 3 different entrees, knowing we would all share.  I ordered the NY Strip with roasted vegetables, my husband the Lobster Ravioli (white sauce), and my daughter the Lobster Supreme (which was 2 pan seared lobster tails on top of a tomato/basil sauce linguine with grilled shrimp and cherry tomatoes).  All were divine!  My steak was done to perfection and had great flavor!  My husbands ravioli was plump full of fresh lobster and the white sauce was not heavy. His plate was empty after we all had our share.  Our daughters lobster and shrimp  was fresh and had great flavor as well.  I loved the linguine, but my daughter and husband would call it basic.  Not much was left of her meal (it too was very large portion) and my steak.  With our tummies full, we opted out of dessert.    If you're looking for some great food, fantastic service, and reasonable prices, this is your place.  On a side note, we had our left overs packed up, (and the server gave us a fresh bowl of bread) and brought them out to a couple of the \"homeless\" people out on the strip.  The look on their faces were priceless.  You never know what their True circumstances are, but sharing a little never hurts.",

We definitely savored every last bit of that - yum!  Onto the entrees. The Greek penne was just alright. Despite the description having a lot of ingredients that should have imparted flavor, I found this dish to be lacking. Nothing stood out. Other entrees that were ordered...a wild mushroom and sage ravioli that wasn't \"sage-y\" enough and a veal d that was a little tough. Lastly, the seafood linguine was alright. The seafood was fine but it wasn't fresh.  All in all, food was alright. Portions were good sized and the banter with the waiter was friendly and enjoyable. A decent Vegas meal.",

Of course I pulled up my Yelp app and Casanova, with good reviews and better prices, fit the bill.   It's kind of tucked away on the upper floor of the Venetian, past the canal. It's a tiny spot, but I had no problem getting a table right away. Service was quick, bread came almost immediately and my waiter got my drink order out to me within a few minutes. I decided on classic lasagna; sometimes you just need the basics and nothing fancy. This came out really quickly as well. It was a nice serving size; just enough to fill you up but without being overly full. This is just a really simple lasagna with no frills - meat, cheese, sauce, and pasta. Nothing out of this world amazing, but nothing to complain about either.   With a glass of wine and my lasagna, the total was under $30. Impressive for Vegas considering the high prices just about everywhere. Definitely worth checking out if you want to spend a little less money.",

It was ridiculous. But we found this restaurant through OpenTable and we're able to make three reservations (20 ppl, 5 ppl, and 4 ppl), for a total of 29 people sitting at the restaurant at one time. It is not a very big restaurant either so we nearly filled the place.   The food was absolutely incredible. Some of the best Italian food I've had in a while. It was served fast, and everything was cooked to perfection. We were there for a wedding dinner and the owner/manager brought my new husband and I delicious champagne on the house which was an incredibly wonderful gesture.  I read before hand some reviews that pointed out issues with service and staff being courteous, but I found it was the complete opposite. The entire table was raving about their expediency and attentiveness.  Lastly, the prices were really not that bad considering what the rest of Vegas is like.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR LARGE PARTIES.",

The portions are good and can be eaten as an entree or shared, as is traditionally done. I had the octopus salad, and my wife had the carpaccio. The octopus was tender, but the overall dish could have used salt and a bit of acidity. My wife said the carpaccio was \"ordinary.\" The service was prompt and courteous. While the food wasn't extraordinary, I did like having a casual place to sit down and have a small, decent bite and a beer on the Strip. After all, this is a town that is known for crowded restaurants with extravagant menus and over the top prices alongside food courts consisting of fast food chains. I'll probably go back.",

    "text": "We randomly decided to stop at this place in the Venetian, and I have to say this was definitely the best Italian place so far. We were seated in the front part of the restaurant. What I loved about this restaurant was how accommodating it was, meaning they have vegetarian and gluten free options for almost all their dishes, which is pretty rare for any restaurant in the US.   I tried the Penne Greek Style Pasta. It was great! This was probably the most flavorful pasta I've had in Vegas. It had a nice sour flavor from the sun dried tomatoes, sweet slices of sauteed onion, basil for extra flavor, and feta cheese and a cream sauce for a salty flavor.   The Focacce, or pizza, is HUGE. Like, they needed to use those fancy, Italian, hand held cutting boards because there is no plate that big. The pizza reminded me of a New York style pizza with it's thin, crunchy crust. The pizza had some sort of herb (I think Rosemary) that gave the pizza a unique flavor.   I didn't try the other two plates of pasta my friends ordered, but they all proclaimed that it was right on the spot. They got the Linguine Mare Nostrum & Fettuccine Casanova.   Our server seemed experienced, as in he was always checking up on us and filling up our water glasses. He was friendly and was smooth, definitely seem to know what he was doing. The food did take a bit of time, but the bread kept us busy. Nice crunchy crust and soft, moist inside with salty butter. We will most definitely be back for more!",

My husband's linguini didn't look like anything special but it was also incredible. Service was efficient, our waiter was kind but brisk, which is totally fine, he was good at his job.  One star off because the layout of the restaurant is awkward, some of the tables seem to kind of just be in the walkway of the shops and I would've been kind of uncomfortable being seated there. Some kind of division or partition would be nice.",

The flatbread was not a flatbread at all, it was just a pizza.  It was under cooked and lacked flavor.  The next day, we were looking to find breakfast on a Sat at 11:30 am and most places had stopped serving breakfast, except for this place.  The breakfast was so bad.   We thought we were getting a good deal by ordering the combo that had eggs, hash browns, bacon/sausage, pancakes/ french toast and toast. I mean how can you go wrong with the basics?  Apparently it's really hard to cook hash browns, so they serve lil frozen triangles, the kind you might find at La Quinta Inn's continental breakfast.  The toast was gross, and they served really old bread that crumbled, and the pancakes were two silver dollar bland nothingness.",

My friends and I are in vegas for a little holiday getaway and were starving looking for a place to go for a late lunch.  We were walking around the Venetian when we stumbled across this spot by the canals   Immediately we were greeted by a very nice hostess who didn't haggle us while we looked over their menu.  Once we agreed to give this place a shot she seated us in the little outside area they have.    We started with the nicoise salad which was to die for! I will be dreaming of that salad.  I ordered the fettuccine Casanova which was mouth watering.  My friend ordered the shrimp pasta which of course I stole a few bites of and that was absolutely incredible! We finished with the canollies and I couldn't get enough! Surprisingly,  the food,  although we had pasta,  was not too heavy or greasy! It was filling yet not overwhelming.    And Ben,  the mnager! He was the highlight of our dining experience! What an amazingly nice and accommodating guy.  We had some dietary restrictions which without hesitation he made dishes work for us that we chose.  Also,  he consistently come by to check in on us.  I've never seen such a caring manager at a restaurant like that before.    This place is a definite must try if you're I. The area.

But when my associate got her steak, it was well done, not the medium rare she had requested.  It was not even close.  When she pointed that out to the server, he did take it away and brought another one.  But it took a long time, while the others in our party were eating (so that their food did not get cold) and so we expected that she would receive some kind of adjustment on the bill, but she did not.  That would have been a nice gesture, for such an expensive dinner.   But she was charged the full price.  That was disappointing.  We won't come here again.",

    "text": "On our visit to Las Vegas I remember this restaurant for the particularly crappy attitude of the staff. As any of you who may have read my reviews know...i base a lot on that initial contact with the staff. Not just the food etc. In this restaurant where we went for breakfast one day it was quiet and yet the waiters could not have cared less about us , and when they did come over they had service skills and attitude to match. The place is clean enough and not too bad decor, though amongst others in a food court type area. We eventually ordered the eggs benedict and cheesy omellette, and of course my cappuccino. The orders came out in an okay time the omellette also had hash brown with it. Overall the food was okay, the omellette was a decent size and the eggs benedict NOT the worst I've had. Thus the two star rating ....if the food was worse it would definitely be a one. And it shows that I really do base a lot on that first impression when entering a restaurant. In this case we were so close to walking out the door!! If in Vegas again would definitely not go here.",

I work at an Italian restaurant in SF, so I do judge a bit more harshly than normal because of how I expect it to be. But my mind has been blown! The food hadn't even come yet and I already am very satisfied with the customer service and the appetizers and bread where amazing as well as the wine. I will definitely update with an entree review.  Shout out to Enrique for an amazing service!!  Update:!! So my dish was fantastic! I got the lobster fettuccini and it was delicious! I have no complaints on that! However my bf got Th lamb chomps and I must admit that it did need more flavor however that with my pasta was delicious! Overall the food was delicious! I will definitely come here again :)",

My sea bass tagine was top-notch, with couscous that I didn't need but couldn't stop eating. The man didn't talk during his lasagna experience, and alpha child loved her angel hair with basil and tomato. The little guy ate from the kids menu - penne and sauce with meatballs, oh my. We topped it off with a completely divine tiramisu.   Atmosphere: wouldn't call it romantic - noisy enough to be fine for kids (like most of Vegas) but not obnoxiously loud. Perfect for what we needed and definitely a good stop on your Vegas culinary whirlwind!",

We were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating staff and picked a quiet table inside. My wife ordered the Saganaki cheese, and although it was prepared a bit differently from the typical Greek style, it had a wonderful taste all its own. I started out with the Octopus salad which was also very flavorful. Next we had both the Rigatoni Bolognase and the Gnocchi Sorrentino. My vote goes to the Rigatoni which was served al dente and in a delicious sauce (and I am rarely impressed by pasta dishes served in American restaurants). My wife then had the Veal Piccata (which was as tender and flavorful as it should be) and I had the Branzino which I enjoyed in spite of the fact that I prefer receiving the entire fish which either I or the server can then filet at the table, but that is simply a matter of personal preference. It was a thoroughly enjoyable meal and experience.",

And it was a perfect serving size (not too much, not too little) which is good because I didn't leave hungry yet I didn't have to waste food. They do offer military discount! Only snafu was they gave me my husband's rare steak and my husband my medium steak. Hence the reason why my steak was so tender (good for me bad for my husband). Didn't realize it until after I ate 3/4 of it. Good choice for breakfast!",

That was enough for us.  I made reservations.   Casanova is located in the Venetian Shoppes.  We walked up and were seated immediately at one of the \"outside\" tables.  They offer Mediterranean dishes and Italian dishes.  I chose the Branzino.  It was colorful and flavorful.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband ordered his regular Italian dish, Chicken Parmigiana.  He thought his dish was really good too.   Service was friendly and the restaurant was not stuffy at all.  It's hard to choose a restaurant in Vegas because there are so many to choose from.  This was a great choice!  Thanks to the young lady who recommended it.",

We have money to spend we were not obnoxious. We know how to act in restaurant but this owner/ manager was so racist he didn't deserve a job at all ever. Even when I asked him why he didn't have a reason. Me and my friends were trying to get some pasta Alfredo simply. We deserve good service for what we are paying for. But this guy was an asshole. Don't know how the food is but the service is terrible. Even the waiters agreed with us as we left as they shrugged they didn't know why.

    "text": "We visited this during christmas holidays. Some Yelp review are really deceiving. The quantity was alright but taste really really bland. The ingredients also were not high quality. The gnochi was really lame. I make a good pasta at home and I am not italian. It is also very pricey for the food and/or ambience they offer. You'd be better off going to Eifell tower rooftop restaurant and have a great time for the money you spend than spend it here. A fancy place by the canal in Venetian had better priced dinner packages than this. So just walk around and check what other options you have before you decide on this one!! And if you do, sorry for you :P",

The hash brown reminded me of what McDonald's would serve. Eggs needed a dash of salt to it. My friend had the strawberry crepe and it seem to be made a little undone.

I stopped here to have a strawberry slushy drink since my favorite place for these, Lime Ice has closed.  I know, I was horror stuck when I saw there was a waffle place there instead.  Anyway, I digress.  The drink was fine and my husband ordered a beer.  The servers here do not smile and there are no pleasantries.  At all.  They were not welcoming.  I can't say they were rude but just indifferent.  After having a few drinks each we finally realized they had food.  I was surprised the bartenders had not mentioned this.  I ordered fries which were good and my husband ordered a pizza.  Halfway through my third drink I noticed a bug crawling in front of me on the bar.  I stood up and told the bartender there is a bug.  A man a few stools down announced it was a cockroach.  The bartender said nothing.  Not one single word as he brushed away the bug.  I asked for the check without finishing my drink.  As I was paying the guy a few stools down asked if they charged me for the drink.  I said yes.  I will never go back to this place again.",

    "text": "Casanova. Which roughly translates to \"house of the...the something...what's nova mean again? New? Nine?\"  It was getting late and we were looking for dinner in Vegas. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly at all, depending on perspective), not a lot of Italian restaurants were open that late. And somehow we had decided on Italian for dinner so...Casanova.  Located in the Venetian Canal Shoppes area, Casanova boasts an unassuming exterior; the restaurant is very open with a lot of small tables. I had thought about making a reservation, but then when I checked online I saw that every single reservation was still available so I figured we would be fine.  We were seated immediately by the very bored looking hostess (can't really blame her, it was Saturday night so by that time everyone was heading to a club), and met swiftly by our waiter. Service was great the entire night, helped by the lack of customers and small space. It's definitely a place for small parties.  Food-wise, you can tell the pasta is actually made from scratch, and it's all cooked perfectly. Our selections included:  -Fettuccine Casanova: Apparently a signature dish (hence the name). It boasted a delicious sauce, well-cooked bacon, and the pasta was al dente.  -Penne with Vodka Pink Sauce: My wife cannot stop raving about her pasta. Everything was cooked perfectly, even the chicken she added to the dish.  As we were leaving Vegas from our weekend, I believe that was her fondest memory of the experience.  Price-wise it's not terrible.  The entrees are a bit pricey but the pasta seems to be in a good range (considering the surroundings).  I consider this a gem, hidden from the rest of the world.  And now I am telling people about the gem, and they will no doubt ruin it by strip mining the entire analogy until it is unrecognizable.  Thanks prospectors in my mind.",

I ordered the Nostrum Linguine and I thought it was pretty good. I was happy with my meal but the other girls just thought their meals were ok. Some liked their meals but they said it wasn't anything to rave about.  Overall I thought it was good but there's so many other amazing places that is worth a try. Prices were decent for Vegas.",

The interior might have been too quiet/formal for us (I imagine the hostess might have thought this too, lol).  My husband, though, felt like we were eating in the mall hallway with shoppers passing inches from us. It would have been nice if there was a low fence/barrier around the dining area, as we saw at other restaurants in the mall.  I give them 4 stars for food and service. My husband loved his Greek pasta. My Scottish salmon with mustard was very good but a tad more rare than I prefer. One odd thing... I thought the server asked whether I wanted potatoes OR veggies so I said potatoes, even though I'd thought it came with both. So my plate had only potatoes, but going back and looking at the menu online, it looks like it was supposed to have both. Not sure if a misunderstanding occurred or if the menu was different at the time I went. ? In any case, the service was excellent. We were pleasantly surprised to see a kid's menu available. Our kids enjoyed the chicken tenders and kid's penne.  Another thing that pushed it to 3.5 stars... the plates were big but the tables were small so our tabletop was crowded for a party of 4.",

Hubby loved his steak & eggs although he didn't care too much for the hash browns because he likes the loosely shaved ones & I liked my sandwich but the bread was a bit heavy so I chose to eat it minus the bread. It's a great people watching restaurant located in the Venetian & surrounded by shops galore, so you either need to leave that area after eating right away or plan on spending some more $$$!!",

The wine selection had something for everyone taste buds and the Chef send out food that surpasses our expectations. We eat and drink wine and for a while feeling like we were in Venice again. Service was on point and the Manager Carmelo Messina was friendly and welcoming with stories of his days of drinking wine and making homemade Olive Oil from his own tree, that is one of the oldest Olive Tree in Vegas. Went in as strangers and walk out contented and made a friend in my backyard. Amazing how Food and Wine again have works it magic.  Highly recommend this romantic, humble restaurant and where you can always experience dinner with friends in Vegas Venice Restaurant... Casanova Ristorante. And tell Carmelo Hello...and to be prepared to be impressed. Family friends and hit all the right notes.",

    "text": "First off, I'll say that I am in love with both Italian and Mediterranean cuisines, and this restaurant did an incredible job of representing the best of these cuisines.  Went last night and can't stop thinking about it. Our server Aquino was incredible. Service all night was attentive, friendly, and incredible welcoming. I was thoroughly convinced that Aquino was truly interested in making sure we enjoyed ourselves.  Now, the meal:  We started with two cocktails. My wife requested something light, and they gave her a drink called the purple dress. It was a beautiful grayish-lavender color, garnished with fresh flowers. Impressive, to say the least. I asked for a surprise and I was brought an Aperol Spritz. An incredible aperitif, the balance of sweet and bitter got me salivating and ready for my meal.   For apps, we had the polpette (all beef angus meatballs) which came with marinara and some toasted bread. My wife had the beef carpaccio; which turned out to be amazingly fresh and light.   For dinner, I opted for a Filet Mignon Au Poivre, which was cooked to a perfect medium with a nice crust. This was served with some veggies and a delicious steak sauce on the side, which was by no means needed, but very much a compliment to the meat. My wife ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass Branzino, which was a big plate with fresh roasted veggies, olives, and three delicious fillets.  For wine I had the Chianti Classico, a True Italian wine and a must for me when eating filet mignon. My wife opted for a Riesling with her fish, and it couldn't have been better.  We ended with a tiramisu to share. It had less marscapone than other tiramisus that I've had, but something tells me that might be more authentic. It was a nice treat to finish the night.  Overall, five stars for service, cook time, presentation, and of course, taste.   Thank you!! We will be back again and again!",

The best items on the menu were the Saganaki, the Fritto Misto and then we shared three pastas. OF all of the pasta, the Linguine with Clams and the Kale Ravioli were top. Id like to go back to try the Lobster Supreme Entree and the Veal Scallopine with Lemon Piccata sauce. But not more main course room.  We decided we had a little room for dessert. When you order Canoli, they were huge. And the chocolate ricotta inside was awesome. If you can get there early to sit on the patio, try, as the people watching is amazing!",

The service was on point, the food was delicious. We had the beef carpaccio, shared lasagna ( my friend loved it so much that we had to go back the next day for some more ), I had the chopino ( delicious ) and my friend had the filet mignon. She said not only that the steak was delicious, but the potatoes that came with it were soo flavorful. And not because we needed more food, but because we just had to try ... we had profiterole for desert. That didn't disappoint either.

Casanova is close to the top of the escalator that takes you from self parking to the casino (and to the Showroom), so a very convenient location. Early reservation for dinner before the show so there was no problem getting a table. Our waiter, Danny, was at our table shortly after we were seated, took our drink orders, and answered questions about the menu. Service was excellent throughout the meal. I went with the Fettuccine Casanova ($19), a pasta dish with mushrooms, ham, bacon, chicken, sun dried tomatoes, smoked scamorza in a light cream sauce. I am usually afraid of dishes with a cream sauce because so many restaurants overdo it. Not here. It really was a \"light\" cream sauce. Excellent dish. My wife went with the Penne Greek ($17), with sun dried tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, garlic, pine nuts, and caramelized onions.  Also a very tasty dish. The ambiance is informal (no tablecloths), excellent service, good food, convenient location, and fair prices (especially for the Strip). And no charge for parking!!!! Will definitely return when having dinner before seeing a show on the strip.",

    "text": "A little backstory of the evening: I was in town for work staying at the Venetian. After a day of work me and a few coworkers decided to get some good Italian food together since we actually ended early! We wanted to go to LAVO, we walked all the way over there to find out they were closed for a private event. Then we decide to try Trattoria and damn that was a feat finding the place, we got lost going through the grand canal shoppes a couple of times. But we finally made it only to find out it'd be an hour long wait. We were starving! Well look across the way and we see this place. Italian food - check. No wait?! We'll take it!  So we got the caprese salad to share and then each ordered our own entrees.   Food (overall 3/5): Caprese (2/5) - it was okay. The burrata was just average and the tomatoes were fine but nothing stand out about it overall  House bread (2/5)- meh. I was underwhelmed. It came out warm but the bread was a bit too crunchy. The center wasn't as soft as I hoped.  Fettuccine Casanova (4/5) - I ordered this as my entree. It was pretty good, I liked the bacon with it and the light cream sauce. I like mushrooms but the type of mushrooms seemed a bit odd for an Italian pasta. The chicken was good to have protein in there and for the price since it was included, but a bit dry/overcooked.   Service (3.5/5): The waiter was friendly and nice except he forgot my coworkers soup. And then he didn't hear my other coworker ask for a box for her leftover food when he was clearing our plates.    But props because there was no wait, it wasn't empty either there were a decent amount of people dining there. Price wise in comparison to the other Italian restaurants it was comparable or slightly cheaper actually. Really not a ridiculous price for Vegas standards. The food was just average though, there's so many other restaurants out there to try so not sure if I would go back.",

We chose to sit inside, the ambiance was more to my taste... wine bottles to look at, talk about and later drink  :) The menu isn't just tapas. Starter was octopus salad that was to die for, tender and very well seasoned. Main course for us was branzino and lobster. Both prepared just perfect, large portions and super fresh. The Wine (Sicilian) was suggested by the manager Carmelo (Italian guy), very knowledgeable and kind.  If you want to drink something different than what you have used to, ask for Carmelo.  Overall it was a great experience,  we will be back again.  Thanks for the hospitality!!! Violeta",

    "text": "My girl and I decided to give Casanova a try while cruising the Venetian. We were greeted by the GM, Carmelo. He guided us to the bar for some drinks before dinner, and my Vanilla Sky was just what I needed. When ready you walked over to Carmelo and he took us to a nice quiet table in the back. We started with the Fritto Misto which was just the perfect size for us to share. Squid, shrimp, asparagus and artichoke hearts...delicious, especially with their dipping sauces. As an entree, my girl ordered the gnocchi and I had the Salmon Rigatoni. The portions were impressive. Both dishes were amazing, and as someone who grew up in Italy I'm a tough critic. I didn't think I could possibly eat all that pasta...but I did. Then finally for dessert we shared a plate of profiteroles..they were chocolate filled with a creme filling...that hit the spot and was a perfect ending to a great meal. Also, during the entire dinner, Carmelo came over to the table himself several times to made sure everything was enjoyable and we were well taken care of. Besides the amazing food, it was this kind of service that will have us coming back for sure.",

I don't always want a huge portion, and I'm not always willing to endure a long wait, and I'm not always keen to pay high prices. Sometimes, I just want to be seated immediately and have a decent meal at a reasonable price. That's Casanova. It was good but not great, the portions were respectable but not huge, and for Vegas the wait time (zero) and the prices (mostly $15-$20 a plate) were reasonable.  The next time I'm there and I want food without it being a production, I will remember Casanova, and I just might even go back.",

    "text": "This review is for breakfast/brunch.   Wanted something different than Grand Lux usual when staying at the Venetian.   Thought this place looked nice strolling thru the shops area.   Sat down for breakfast and started out ok.   I ordered eggs benedict and my wife ordered 2 eggs over easy with sausage special.  Pretty standard breakfast order.     The food came out from the kitchen, and placed down in front of us and left by the waitstaff.   My wife's eggs were like hockey pucks, not over easy by any stretch of imagination and 2 hard yellow yolks.  The sausage was like a frozen jimmy dean variety sausage that looked rather sad.   I told her we could send back but she didn't want to wait etc.  My eggs benedict were placed on English muffin that was either not toasted, or only toasted for very short time.   The waiter was no where to be found but if my wife wasn't sending back, neither was i.  At this point, running short of coffee and a good 10 minutes after being served our food, our waiter popped in and asked \"Is the food great?\".   So i thought i would let him know and told him it was terrible in a calm manner(had he not asked \"great\", i might have just politely smiled and said ok but the great question was a bit over the top for what we had been served).  I asked if those eggs looked close to over easy and if my muffin looked toasted.   Before i could ask for more coffee, our waiter walked AWAY!   Amazing.  i called over the manager and told him what was going on and that of all the issues this breakfast was having, the waiter walking away was the worst.  The manager told me the waiter was new and thought that taking off the price of one entree should recover the damage.    I asked for more coffee and I told him the whole thing was terrible and rather insulting on the service part(the waiter just stood about 10' away and never acknowledged anything.    I left 0.0% tip which i never do, and left realizing that choosing Casanova for breakfast was a big mistake this morning.   I've never seen a waiter just walk away after me calmly answering his question if all was \"great\".  Anyways, skip this place for breakfast, dinner might be a different story.",

Stopped to look at their menu and spoke with Andi Jubani (I believe the manager) who spoke of how fresh their food was and how they strove for excellence.  We had the Calamari, the Caprese and a wonderful Fettuccine Casanova for a shared dinner.  The calamari was extremely fresh (especially for calamari to be found in the desert) and the mozzarella for the Caprese was perfect.  The Fettuccine Casanova was made with fresh pasta, chicken, portabellas and tomatoes in a light cream sauce.  It was excellent.  I would highly recommend this little Ristorante to anybody who would like to people watch at the Canal Shop area in The Venetian and is interested in high quality food and great dining experience.",

    "text": "I had a bad experience here. The food portions are very small. It's more like tapas sizes at entree prices. Also we received very poor service. Waiter was nice when you could find him but otherwise there was no service. We saw tables who were seated after us being served within a few minutes of being seated but we waited a good 25 minutes before getting our entrees. We were a group of four but the waiter managed to mess up our orders. One person wanted veggies in place of rice while the other wanted rice. When the plates came out, they both had veggies. When we brought it to our waiters attention he said the plates must have been switched. He took the plate from the table and got a plate from another table and have it to us. From working in food service, you never switch customers plates like this. The person could have coughed or sneezed on the plate or taken a bite out of it. It is food safety 101. You never take a plate back that has been served already and give it to another guest. Also, the yogurt sauce had a distinct acidic/bubbly quality which (if you know anything about food safety) means the yogurt has gone bad. We brought it to the waiters attention and he said that the lime in the yogurt dressing made it that way. Very disappointing. It's a nice ambiance and I'm sure most people have a decent experience but if you're willing to pay $30 an entree, this place is not worth the money by any stretch. Be smart and eat somewhere else.",

I ordered a meatball slider with fries, a Guinness and the total was $19.00. To me that is a bargain in Las Vegas, If I can get a meal under $25 dollars including tips I consider that a good deal. The bar area is only managed by 1-2 people but service is still efficient and friendly. It did not take long for our food to arrive and drinks came quick as well. The meatball sliders came with two gigantic meatballs and a generous portion of thin cut fries. The sauce on the meatball was a bit bland but a tad of ketchup solved the problem. If you're looking for a quick bite and multiple large HDTVs to enjoy the game this is the place to be.",

Free ----- Bread- hot, fresh crunch on the outside but soft on the inside. It was pretty good.   Ordered the following:  Pasta Casanova- this pasta is excellent in every way. The pasta was al dente, the sauce was amazingly creamy and light at the same time. The bacon, chicken and mushrooms were perfectly cooked. The veggies were fresh. It was a perfect plate of pasta. It's one of those, I'm going to crave this pasta for life. I'm definitely going to try to remake this at home.   Lasagna- the lasagna was good but I've had better elsewhere. I liked it but I wasn't blown away by it.   Victorian flat brea- with all the topping on it, surprisingly the crust is light and crispy.  The sausage were cooked perfectly and the artichokes weren't soggy at all.   This was actually surprisingly a good place to eat at.  Only reason I am giving it three starts is the service. Our server was very rude! Experience would've been a lot better if he wasn't so rude.",

    "text": "It was our final night of the Vegas trip; tired of buffet but already had upscale formal dinner. Decided to do something in between and found this Italianish (because they have Greece and Middle Eastern food too) restaurant.  You wouldn't believe what a hectic time it was when we tried to locate this restaurant. It's inside of the Venetian; we asked the security guard for direction at first and we were pointed to some random place and we got lost. Then we asked people working in multiple shops in the mall and no one knew where it was. We were literally lost for almost 20 minutes until we finally got there. It's sort of in a random pop up place and it's not located on the main shopping corridor neither...  The restaurant is not very big. It was Sunday night and was half full. Food time:  -) Calamari: B. It's actually hard to judge this one because it included shrimp too... normally it's squid only. The squid was okay, would be better if the squid body has less moisture inside the fried ring. But fried shrimp in this setting wasn't a great match. It's not Chinese type of fried garlic prawn but at the same time it was semi-fried.... nice try but not a very good result here.  -) Linguine Mare Nostrum: B. The linguine was a bit on the hard side; the spiciness of the spicy tomato sauce overwhelmed the balance of the two and couldn't bring out the seafood taste. The seafood was okay in general.  I shouldn't pick seafood linguine at the first place; my friend had Fettuccine Casanova (mushroom, chicken, bacon, tomato etc in cream sauce) and I tried some bites, it was very good. I would have given an A- for that but again I didn't have the whole dish so I can't grade it.  After all, I think my expectation for this restaurant was an above-average class Italian restaurant; looking at the menu, it is not one of those and it offers several cuisine style which might be good for groups looking for different varieties for sharing. Anyway it was a good try, the waiter was nice; but I would pick other places next time if I'm craving for pasta in Vegas in the future.",

Yelp guided us to this place in the Venetian (main food court area, near the inside canal waterway). We chose it because it had some Mediterranean influences and maybe we could find a lite bite.  We ordered a salad, an appetizer, and shared a chicken kabob plate. None of it was very good, fresh tasting, nor remarkable. The  food alone I'd probably give 3 stars...but we waited about 15 minutes to have a waiter come talk to us after sitting down, while every person on staff worked to combine tables for a party of about 15...guess our party of 2 didn't matter much. When we were finally greeted by a server he was very much in a hurry, did not wish to answer questions at all, and he basically said we could not make any substitutions (even for food allergy needs). Well, that pretty much killed our expectations, and we were pretty disappointed.  Honestly, I have no need to ever go back to this eatery/restaurant while in Vegas as there are literally hundreds of better places to choose from.   Sorry Casanova, you've not charmed us.",

Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.  First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.  I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.   To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",

I was surprised and shocked at that time, because it was obvious that there were plenty of seatings available.   I stood there until a waiter came to me and greeted us to the seats.  Well, we enjoyed the food here, yet do not appreciate the attitude of the hostess, when we walked out she didn't even look at us, let alone giving us the \"thank you, good bye\" that I expect to receive from most of restaurants.",

Garden salad was dressed with emulsified balsamic dressing with not enough oil, very tart.  Chicken parm (1 breast) was fried in rancid oil, terrible and inedible. Lasagne tasted like Chef Boyardee ravioli at best. We ate through what we could and brought our concerns to the waiter who didn't check on our table until we were 'finished'. We expressed our complaints about the oil.  He argued that only high quality olive oil and cheeses are used as was belligerent with defending their cooking process.  Overall awful, over priced and terrible customer service.  They reluctantly comped our bill but made us feel like we had unjustified complaints.",

As soon as we sat down seemed like the manager/server I think he's name was Jamie told us they're expecting a party of 16 and asked us if we could move to a round table that they were starting to set up for us . We wanted some quiet time to enjoy our meals and the table they wanted to move us to was in the front of the entrance where everyone walks past you. After we told our server that we'd like to keep our seats he said okay but you have to get out before 7. In the most rude way possible .   The food came right away . We ordered shrimp and calamari appetizers which were delicious . I ordered margarita flat bread . I would say it wasn't that great . Lamb chops were overly priced for 3 skinny blend pieces for $33 . What a rip off!  Eggplant was amazing but very similar to the lasagna . Everything went cold in 5 minutes. Overall bad service . Even the hostess seemed unwelcoming ((.   Their service left me with a bad taste in my mouth!",

It worked for a quick, Italian dinner (slash Greek). We started with complimentary bread and was given olive oil (real olive oil) and vinegar when asked.  All of our plates came out and I don't think any of us had any complaints. I had pasta with onions and prosciutto which was a large portion. I had to take half of it home.  They were very accommodating to my cousin who has severe food allergies. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I believe an Italian place deserves 5 stars only if they make their pasta and gnocchi fresh. I'm not incredibly sure if it was freshly made but since it was not on their menu and did not taste home made, I'm assuming it was from a box/freezer.",

    "text": "Casanova is a cute little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. Unfortunately, I didn't know how small it was. I had a table reservation for 13 people and was seated outside the actual restaurant which was really the middle of the walkway of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It was extremely loud, especially since there is a bar not 10 feet away. It's also right before the food court so there was a ton of food traffic throughout dinner. I would definitely reccommend this place if you were in a small group, up to 4 at the most. They would most likely seat you inside where it is very adorably decorated.  For an Italian restaurant at The Venetian, the food was extremely affordable. I got the Timballo which is basically penne in a creamy pesto sauce baked with parmesan on top. It was so flavorful and very filling; I wasn't able to finish my plate. The bread they serve you is so good too and delightfully roasted and warm.   If you want good Italian at a reasonable cost, I definitely suggest Casanova.",

    "text": "There are so many good things to say about this restaurant.  My wife and I came to Las Vegas for a four day vacation, and I decided to try several Italian restaurants during my stay.   On our last day, I chose Casanova's based on some positive reviews, and we were staying in the Venetian, and it is located in the Venetian Grand Canal shop area.  When I walked up to the entrance to the restaurant, I was greeted by a very friendly hostess, who asked if I would like to see a menu.  I told her I loved Lasagna, and she motioned me to a touch screen menu, where she chose \"Lasagna\", and it brought up an appetizing photo of a nicely layered dish.  It was just what I had in mind.  The restaurant is not large, and half of the seats are located near the aisle leading to the Venetian Grand Canal.  This was really where I wanted to be, since it was Vegas, and I love to watch people.  I requested a table for one, and she accommodated me immediately (it was about 8pm on a Saturday night, and I was expecting a wait).  Immediately after being seated, a server came by to see if I would like water and bread, which I asked for.  Shortly afterwards, my waiter (Mark) came by to see if I would like a drink.  I ordered a cocktail, and received it fairly quickly.  The bread was simple, and delicious.  It was served with sweet cream butter, and I had a second order before I had my entree submitted.   The bread was so good!  I ordered an Arugula and Tomato Salad (which was called \"Burrata and Tomato\" on the appetizer list I believe, not the salad list).  It was a very different appetizer than I had before.  I think it could have used a bit more balsamic vinagrette (which I mentioned to the manager, who seemed quite open to my input), but it was a great starter dish.  I had a few cocktails, and then had Mark roll out the Lasagna.  Man...I have to say it was impressive.  While all palates are different, in my opinion this dish had just the right balance of sauce, cheese and meat, while still placing the spotlight on the pasta.  The pasta was hot throughout (something many restaurants do not accomplish), and the portion size was large enough for one and a half people.  It was so delicious though, I just could not leave any on my plate.  Loved it!  All-in-all, I'd say this was my favorite Italian restaurant so far, ANYWHERE!  It will definitely be at the top of my list the next time I come to Vegas.",

My husband's water was empty and he wanted to order another beer and we couldn't get the waiters attention. He waited on both tables next to us, filled waters but ignored us. We got a discount from tickets for tonight so I can't help but feel that was why we were ignored. Maybe he thought we were cheap and would tip bad.... Idk but we are great tippers and tip 20% based on what it would have been before the discount. We kept trying to ask for water and he avoided any eye contact. He left the pitcher of water on the table next to us after filling another tables water. I finally had to get up and fill our waters myself . We were going to order more drinks and dessert but at that point we were over it. It was really disappointing to be treated so poorly We were looking forward to a nice date on our last night in Vegas with dinner and a show and our dinner was a huge let down.",

Even though it was 10:15 and they closed at 11, the service was incredible.  Our waiter was really friendly and prompt.  Also, the food.  Oh, THE FOOD!  We got the special, which was penne in a vodka sauce, and hands down, it's the best pasta I have ever had.  Their caesar salad was also delicious.

The lentil soup is also perfect if you want some protein fix up. I eat meat but this place had such an amazing veggie menu that i didnt miss my chicken!  The servers are very thoughtful..they gave us the basket of fresh baked warm bread with butter cubes UNDER them..it made for really soft and easy spread. Five freaking stars.",

We liked their complimentary bread too.  2) service: no wait to grab dinner around 6pm and the waiter and servers were prompt with our food and drinks.  3) price: most entrees were between $20-40 but it was a great deal with the 50% off your main entree if you purchase a voucher for $2 per person from the Tix4Tonight box office (few locations along the strip). We paid $4 and saved $26.   It's a smaller restaurant located in the Venetian hotel so not an ideal place for larger groups. A romantic and unassuming food spot. We would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Absolutely absurd experience!   A smaller casual mix cuisine restaurant. It mentions tapas but the menu is very limited.   My guests and I had a reservation at 12pm and after we were seated we were told about four times by two different people that the wait will be long for our food. Approximately 20 minutes. We accepted the wait and placed our order.    Ten minutes after our order was placed, our waiter returned once again letting us know it will be a long wait.  There were only a few customers in the restaurant finishing their breakfast at this time.  I asked how long is the wait exactly? Now that 10 minutes had passed it was an additional 20 minutes and 30 minutes to have the food read. (This is for a party of three ordering pasta.) A total of nearly one hour for our food.  I want the 20 minutes of my life back from wasting my time.  We then got up and went a few steps away to enjoy some pretty good burgers.  Please tell me why you would accept an afternoon reservation if you knew that the shift change will affect your guests?  I cannot understand the point of all this. A complete waste of time.  What you need to know:  -- There is a Casanova Bar located right outside of the restaurant  -- Staff is highly unorganized  -- There are other restaurants more worthy of your time within its vicinity -- Location is far and tucked in the corner",

When we stopped by the previous day most tables were full except for a couple on the very edge outside where pedestrian traffic is non stop. I didn't want to rub elbows with passerbys while we dined so we just left and chose to check it out the next day.  I'm very glad we did because it was a fun breakfast date with my girl. The waiters are all nice and ours was prompt with drinks and food service. I think he may have been the manager or maybe owner because he was not in a uniform and he was overly dedicated and enthusiastic during our interactions. We ordered omelets and crepes, one Nutella and banana crepe and the other ham and cheese And everything was delicious. I only tried my Nutella and banana but my daughter confirmed evth was very tasty and fresh even on her side of the table lol. The portions were kinda big for the crepes but that's perfect for the people who want to share and try a gbit of evth in a place like this. We enjoyed our breakfast and the prices are very reasonable for being in the middle of the Venetian. Less than $44 for breakfast for 2( or really 3 because we ordered 3 plates to share) plus drinks it was a wonderful deal. We will need to come back for lunch or dinner for sure. Can't wait!!",

Technically Italy is in the Mediterranean Sea.  However it has its own category for food. As I see it, Mediterranean means Greek tapas falafel and Gyros....and this wasn't it.... But we were hungry so we stayed and ordered.    They didn't serve iced tea, and the bread (crustini) was ok.  My Casanova Alfredo was good, but my wife's clams were marginal....I will keep hunting for my Utopian Mediteranean restaurant the next time in town.",

    "text": "I came here for a double date with reservations at 8:15 to celebrate my 30th birthday...and then did not get seated until nearly 9. There was a line of flustered customers overwhelming a hostess, while the restaurant manager was frantically trying to prepare tables. It is not beyond reasonable circumstances for a small restaurant to become behind, particularly during a dinner rush, but there was definitely a lack of management of arrivals and seatings of customers.   After the chaotic shuffle of being seated, we made the best of our evening and was able to enjoy a fairly nice rest of the evening. Two bottles of wine, lamb, lobster ravioli, NY strip- we were in the mindset of having a fine dining experience.   To be fair, I'm not certain that reservations are well observed by many restaurants in Las Vegas, but other establishments have certainly made the effort to make things right. We spent over $300 here hoping for a great experience, but even after a week from the event, the most notable memory was of the poor service and not the food.",

I was very thirsty and waiter left a mini pitcher of iced tea. So far so good. Ordered linguine mare casanova, spaghetti with meatballs, and minestrone soup. I was thinking of ordering chicken parmesean,  but found it was deep fried (I like pan fried). Pasta was perfectly done. Meatballs good and plenty. Seafood plentiful and shrimp were huge. The minestrone soup is amazing, it's very flavorful, and tasted fresh.   Service was really great. Omar was awesome. This may be a new regular when i am in town.  Desert was  canoli. Canoli crust was nice and crunchy and filling was good.  Great overall for a moderately priced italian on the strip.",

The discount card gave us half off the entrees but the drinks were full price. Casanova is located in the shops at the Venetian. The seats we had were kind of outside the restaurant (but still inside) near the common area of the mall. I guess that's kind of different but the restaurant had a nice look about it. We ordered Sangrias which were good. We had the hummus sampler for our appetizer, which was really good. Then Hubby got the rib eye and I ordered the Penne, Greek style. Both entrees were divine. We will definitely go back.",

Gosh it was awful... Must really have a rare palate to enjoy that. Definitely think they need to improve their menu, more taste tests and standards for cooking. Real flowers around the restaurant is a plus. Fake candles brings the experience back down a little. Don't go.",

This restaurant had a high rating and was open to 11pm, which to me means that they will keep taking customers until 11pm and everyone can have a nice, relaxed dinner without being rushed to get out. Apparently to the staff of this restaurant it means that everyone must get out by 11. The food was pretty good, we had the octopus for appetizer, which was really delicious, I had angel hair with olive oil and tomatoes and my friend had the linguini carbanara, both of which were good, not the best we have ever had, but definitely tasty. The waiters/busboys/food runners kept coming by every five minutes to see if they can take our plates, we were clearly still eating. Then they offered to put our wine in \"to go\" cups, instead of letting us finish it there. We felt rushed and were overall unsatisfied with our experience.",

You can see their fancy table setting from far away haha   Food-  My friend and I both got the fettuccini Casanova (recommended by the waitress). We both didn't like it. It was pretty bland and the fettuccini... The texture was a bit off. I could have told them I didn't like it and ask for another dish... But honestly I just didn't feel like it so I didn't bother. ( i work in the food industry so I gauged my feelings about it and it wasn't worth the trouble for me)   Angel hair pasta- not sure if this is what the name was but my friends really loved this dish  Shrimp ravioli - I tried this off my friends. Delish! Creamy and plenty of flavor!   One friend got some sort of seafood pasta dish. She also didn't like hers. Ate the seafood and left the pasta.",

    "text": "Good pasta. Terrible service. We got seated at 11:50am. The waiter didn't come take order for more than 5 min. When asked one waiter to get our order, he brushed me off telling me to wait. I waited a few min but nobody took order, and i could not get a hold of a waiter.  After a few more min, I had to shout to finally get a waiter to take a order from me and my family. As we ordered we aske that the food arrive asap and don't want it to be held off for other foods that are not ready.   Then it took 10 min for the bread to arrive, but they gave us butter with it. I like it with vinegar and oil, so when i asked for it they gave me the vinegar and oil but no plates to poor them on. What kind of an italian place give you butter with bread, then don't give you plates when you ask for vinegar and oil to eat with bread?  Remeber how I asked for the food to come as they get ready? Well it took them 30min to get us food and the reason is because they were holding the food to serve them together!  The food was alright. A bit salty though so we drank a lot of water. Even after 3 of our glasses were empty they did not refill the water for more than 10min until i had to call for them.   Lastly, i was super pissed and did not want to leave any tip. But guess what? They charged a gruitity charge for our group of six.   For those who might be thinking that the restaurant may have been busy... There were four tables besides us and they were all tables of two or three and there were three waiters.",

    "text": "I second another Yelpers thoughts: This small restaurant caught our eye on the quest for breakfast, and seemed like they had a reasonable breakfast special. I could have done better myself at home!  The breakfast truly was comparable to a Jimmy Dean or Swanson frozen breakfast.  Keep on passing on.... you'll get a better breakfast at McDonald's and it will be less expensive.   The staff didn't seem friendly or even awake, either :(  A little smile goes a long way!",

    "text": "I was assigned the task of setting up a client dinner while we were at a conference in Vegas. Having never been to Vegas added to the degree of difficulty! I reviewed lots of restaurants and based on reviews, chose Casanova. It was kind of difficult to locate inside the Venetian Hotel Resort, but other than that, this place was amazing! Outstanding service by friendly waiters. I will say, they weren't the speediest, but the night was full of laughs and great food. Everyone told us how good their food was. We were a large party that they accommodated very well. We got numerous appetizers, all of which were tasty and full of yummy surprises - like mint in the Dolmathakia! Wow! Can't say enough good things. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "This was a nice Italian place. The menu had definite influences of Mediterranean and Greek food as well and there was a pretty good variety of options.   The service was fast and friendly and there wasn't a wait to sit which was definitely welcome on an evening on the strip. Mark, our waiter was very nice and attentive. I would say the atmosphere was average although my wife liked it.  Food was good. I had the gnocchi and thought they were made well in a really nice and fresh tomato and basil sauce. The portion was the right size. My wife had the mussels. She thought they were larger and juicier than usual and really enjoyed the couscous that came with it. I thought it was a bit odd that three of her mussels were unopened and she wasn't able to open one at all.   Good place. Good food. Good service. Nothing out of the ordinary on the menu but a good dining experience with fair prices.",

Asked the waiter for the wine list but never got it. Asked for some olive oil for our bread and never got that either  Had the sea bass and an eggplant pasta as our entrees. Both were pretty bad. The sea bass filets were tasteless and tasted like they were from frozen filets. The couscous that came with it was also tasteless. The eggplant pasta was okay but lacked flavor. The side of sauteed veggies were overcooked.   Definitely won't be going back",

Ordered two pastas with my daughter who is meatball fanatic and she gave the dish two thumbs up!!!!!   Was on the road passing through or i would have tried a glass of wine.   Highly recommend.

I had the risotto which gave me quite the stomach ache. I'll try it again the next time I am in town but I think there are better places inside the Venetian.",
