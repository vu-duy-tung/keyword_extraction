    "text": "This is the only restaurant still charging you for food that make you sick. That's right. You aren't hearing it wrong. I would rather starve myself than eating here and getting food poisoning and must-be-paying for it. Avoid this place at all cost!!!! For detail, please read the following.   I came here with a few friends and ordered a bowl of pho. My pho came out with the smell of drugs or some sort of medicines. But I just convinced myself that maybe the smell came from a different place. I proceeded for a little bit and that smell was so strong that I couldn't continue. And the smell actually came from my bowl of pho. I told the waiters that my food smells funny and tastes a bit bitter. He asked if I want a new bowl but I said no because my stomach felt weird at the time. A few minutes later, I had to run to the restroom inside the restaurant and threw up. When I came out, they gave my friends the check that included the price of that bowl of pho. They didn't want to take that $10 off the check regardless my reasonings. I would have tipped them $10 anyway if the service was good. So at the end, I asked him to remake the pho for me and put in togo boxes. Apparently I wasn't gonna eat it. Who would eat something at the same restaurant that gave you food poisoning a few minutes earlier?   I personally think it was ridiculous and unethical. Indeed, it was absurd to charge the customers the food that poisoned them. They should be grateful that I didn't sue their ass for making dirty and poisoned food. This restaurant is crowded because it's one of the places opening 24/7. But I would rather starve myself than eating here and paying to get poisoned food.",

    "text": "I had never had Pho before and I had parked in this lot to go get a mani/pedi. But I also needed to get some protein in my system. This place was right in front. I saw that it had a \"Best of Vegas\" banner and after I walked in I realized that my friend suggested this spot to me before.   I went for a rare steak and brisket Pho. My honey went for a three meat Pho. We also ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken, which was my favorite item of the night and by far the best sweet & sour I've ever had.  Back to Pho. I like soup. I like noodle in my soup. I didn't like one of the greens they used. It had a light minty taste, but wasn't mint. Whatever it was (I think they also brought it out on the side for us to add into our soups), it distracted me in a bad way. The leaves look like basil, but definitely aren't basil. Anyway, if it wasn't for that, I think I would have become a bigger fan of Pho than I currently am. The meat was alright. Tasted too bland. But again, this was my first Pho experience. I guess this is how Pho works and I may not be a fan. I don't have to love everything I eat and everything that others love, right?  Their service was extremely fast. Five minutes after we placed our order, the Pho was out. Wow.",

This time I figure I invite out of town guests at around 0230 in the morning Monday December 22nd 2014.....The initial waitress did not say a single word to us in the 4 times she went to our table and took a little over 10 minutes to make first contact. The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons.   The food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda   3 dollars for carbonated water!  we questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both \"fists\" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem!   The question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said:   \"I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill\" .  Needless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.  I am sure that punk is the SON of the hard working parents who most likely slave all morning and afternoon to get this restaurant running..... If you look at the reviews, most of the lesser stars are because the graveyard staff attitude.",

You can tell the guy got an attitude because he just had his head down and was just throwing everything around until he gave me my card and receipt back ... seriously this place is trash never coming here again I literally never make comments like this at all but man this place is something else",

TO BE HONEST. that hyped me way too much and it just didnt live up to the behemoth banner.  when i walk into a place and notice, you have a waiting list, that right there tells me youre good enough but it doesnt hype me like a giant banner. lol  the pho was okay, the broth didnt taste bad, it just wasnt the best ive had. there wasnt that much noodle, like it was proportioned wrong. meat to broth to noodle ratio was off and i was left dissatisfied. the bill was cheap for 7 people so i guess thats okay   this place is really clean and the staff are like any other place, no service at all so expect that.",

Sometimes at 11:00 pm, after a really really long day, or 3:00 am, perhaps at the end of a night out, a bowl of pho just hits the spot.  - Rotating specials (e.g. this week included salt and pepper eggplant, szechuan eggplant, and pork buns.) - Drinks include thai tea with boba and soda with preserved lemon  Cons:  - The service was really pretty terrible. Water came quickly, but after that it took a while to get other drinks and about 20 minutes to get our check (after asking three different people). It would have taken longer, but we got up to go pay. They were pretty rude about it too, telling us it had only been 5 minutes.   In-betweens: - The pho was okay, although the broth was on the bland side, and my rare steak was faaaarrr beyond well done by the time I saw it. I would recommend ordering the rare steak and brisket, with the steak on the side. This will keep it rare when you add it to your pho =)",

Yeah yeah this place is full of Michelin 5-Star places, but oh lordy lord is this place good. I think it's one of the best vietnamese spots in the U.S and I'm comparing it to hubs in LA/Little Saigon/Dallas/Boston and other major vietnamese hubs. I tell everyone I know in the Boston area to come here and they agree that this place rocks.  I will say the one thing I don't enjoy is the service for it is a typical asian restaurant experience - sub par. Also, the spring rolls aren't so great, but everything else from pho, com tam, mi xao don, cha gio and the drinks are worth it!  PS - though this place is open 24/7, they will deny service if they can't handle it. Happened to me during EDC last year. I just left to change some clothes and came back in like 20 mins.",

    "text": "In Las Vegas, you want to eat at places that are busy. Especially in asian spots. Why? Because it means food MOVES and you don't get leftovers or stuff that's been sitting waaay too long under a heat lamp. And eat off the strip. Waaay cheaper...  This place is open 24/7 (plus) and was busy from the moment we stepped in with people still waiting to be seated when we left about an hour or so later (plus). We're talking about midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas too. Service was quick (+), the place was clean (+), food was hot and very good (+). I wish I had taken pics, but we were all just too hungry to care after not having eaten since about 3 pm that afternoon. Definitely come here for a change of scenery from the pricey food places on The Strip (+). Prices were reasonable and food choices are endless here (+). You don't want to visit here if you're the undecided sort. I didn't seen any sandwiches here, but plenty of options for drinks as well. My one questionable food choice was the salted boiled chicken. We ordered a  1/2 a chicken expecting to be an American sized 1/2 chicken portion. Wrong!! We got a chicken that could pass for a cornish game hen size. Yeah, I thought we were back in China again with the size of this bird. Kind of felt gyped in a way( - ). Hence the reason for the not quite 5 star rating. Portion sizes for the Pho we all ordered were  a good size. Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference between the size of my small bowl and the large bowl my other dining companions ordered. I was still full after finishing my Pho and I didn't even drink any of the soup.  Eat here because it's close to The Strip, cheaper than any place on The Strip that serves the same thing but will probably charge you more (maybe $5 more. Yikes!!). Parking could be an issue at peak times, so I suggest if you're from out of town to get an Uber/Lyft here.",

    "text": "I decided to bring my family here this past Sunday (4/30/17) because we've been wanting to try other pho joints and I came here before on two separate occasions in the past and from what I remembered, it was really good. We had 7 people in our party, plus a baby, and it took for-freaking-ever to get a table. We also came during the dinner rush on a Sunday, so it was understandable. We waited at the cramped and overwhelming seating area at the entrance and were finally called for a table after about 45 minutes.  We were seated at our table by the hostess and given menus. Everyone quickly decided what they wanted to eat and we placed our order with our waiter before we even got our waters! My family ordered a couple plates of gi cun (fresh spring rolls), roasted chicken with garlic, shrimp fried rice, and five bowls of pho. The food came out really fast, which seemed a little suspicious to me, considering how crowded the place was! First of all, the spring rolls were extremely small compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to and the rice paper was hard and difficult to chew, as if it had been sitting out for a long time waiting to be served. The spring rolls definitely weren't fresh. Second of all, the broth in my pho wasn't very hot. It was just warm. Third of all, the shrimp fried rice was extremely bland. There wasn't much flavor at all. Somebody pass the soy sauce!  As I was eating my pho, I started to remember why I enjoyed my previous visit here. I came here with my cousins at 3 in the morning after a long day of getting crazy at Life Is Beautiful. Of course anything tastes good when you've been on your feet all day, you're intoxicated, and half asleep, right? Needless to say, the food is just okay, not really satisfactory. The quality isn't there.  Straight up, the customer service is terrible... That's me being nice. The servers aren't attentive and it took a few tries to get our waiter's attention. I asked one of them for some extra lime and as he was walking away, I caught him rolling his eyes. Of course, he never came back, so I had to ask someone else. They were definitely understaffed for the amount of customers they had!  It's unlikely that I'll be returning any time soon and if I do decide to give this place another try in the future, I'm definitely just going to stick with the pho and stay away from the spring rolls and fried rice.",

But, when I sliced it was hard looked it was not fresh. took a bite tough not easy to chew. Try adding Terriyaki sauce still not much better. $13.00 wasted I won't order it again. When paying the check the restaurant manager knows that I am a regular visitor asked how was my dinner the beef stew excellent no problems but, when I told him that Terriyaki chicken was bad he said he was sorry and will speak to the chef. I made it real clear that I was not going to order it again. Pho Kim Long has great Pho soup. There entrees they need to improve.",

They took back the plate and gave me a different dish that I didn't order.  When the bill came, they charged me for two dishes.  When I asked if they had made a mistake, the manager/ owner told me he purposely did that because I tasted the food and I should not throw away food because there are lots of hungry people.  I told him I did not taste the food.  I cut open the chicken and realized there are no meat.  If he felt strongly about the hunger people, he should have returned the plate and tell me no I cannot change or tell me I need to pay for different meat.  I would have gladly pay extra.  The manager's behavior was demeaning and RUDE even for a Vietnamese restaurant standArd.  I can not believe this place is still open when there are so many other pho places in Las Vegas with better yelp rating.  Now I know why they have low ratings compare to other pho places.",

They're open 24/7 now and the consistency isn't what it once was unfortunately.   The one thing I think they still do here better than most is their Chicken Pho. Since chicken pho isn't all that popular most places simply have it as an after-thought. At PKL it is done well with a very good broth.  They must be doing something right to always be as busy as they are, but unless it 3am and you just got out of the club, I still think there are better options in the vicinity.",

Everything was great except for the meat balls, they were very plain with no flavor at all and the texture was not chewy like all the meat balls I had in my life before.  Other than that, the portion is really worth the money with plenty of meat. The service is fast and both bus boy and waitress were very attentive.",

    "text": "Hmmm...The first time I came here (2016), my sister took me here for a late night/early morning meal. She & her friend are vegan, so they opted for pho and I got a noodle dish with meat. When the food came out, my meat was blue (YIKES) and their pho's veggies weren't fresh. All 3 of us ended up with food poisoning even though I avoided the meat!  I tried giving it another chance on Sunday AM with a friend which was alright. Food was fine and came out quickly.  15 mins ago -- Came alone to get a bite to eat and while I sat down waiting for my waiter/waitress, I was promptly greeted by a COCKROACH who went under my seat!! I freaked and told the host then went to my car. Fumbling for my keys, the host met me at my car and said \"let me get your door for you\". I responded saying \"Oh, I must've left my keys because of the cockroach\" and he said \"Don't worry, we will kill the cockroach\". Opened my door and handed me the keys.  Disgusting. I will NEVER go back!!! Go up the street to H.K Seafood instead. Clean, friendly staff, and super tasty food.",

    "text": "Cons outweigh the pros of this place.   Went here today due to the higher than 3 star ratings and its location. Had a desire to eat some Vietnamese food even though I had some back in the OC last week where I live. This place is large with plenty of seating which is good. We were promptly seated, again another positive. They brought us our waters pretty quick too. So far so good.  The waitress comes around and I order in Vietnamese and ask her for Pho Tai Sach(tripe). The waitress tells me they don't have that. Um ok, sure its not everyone's cup of tea, but even a basic pho restaurant should carry that. Strike one. Someone in my group orders Bun Bo Hue. At least that went off without a hitch... so we thought. About 10 mins later the Bun Bo Hue comes out. No cabbage or veggies are included with it. This is what the waitress tells us after the fact. Strike two. Again, any normal viet place would serve a plate of veggies with that.   So here is where things go wrong from that point forward. We sat there for another 15 mins waiting for our other 2 bowls of pho. Talk about ridiculous. Either time it right so all the food comes out together but don't bring just one bowl. Whatever, we were finally realizing this place had some issues.  Finally, we get our pho and we eat it. To thier credit they included alot of meat. Not much else unfortunately. The pho broth was truly bland. No aroma at all. The noodle portion was small too.   The final insult was when the bill came. I paid for it by card. I always leave the tip in cash so I zeroed out the tip field. The watress comes over and picks up the bills and says \"zero on tip?\". I said yes. Thought she just wanted clarification before she processed the transaction. She then puts the bill back down on the table and walks off. WTF, She literally comes back 2 mins later, and again ask me, \"no tip?\" I then tell her we are leaving cash for the tip. She then picks up the bill and walks off. I have never had any waitress anywhere harrass me about the tip like this. She literally did not deserve one after that, but we left one anyway just because we aren't savages.  Conclusion: there are pros to this place like the large amount of meat they give you amd prompt seating. But why bother the deficiencies in the flavor and the staff out weigh my desire to come back. You decide for you, but I won't be coming back after this experience. Plenty of other Viet places near by with better ratings.",

That's awesome!  We made it here at about 10pm on a weekday.  It is not a little place, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes before we could be seated.  Only 1 person in our party of 8 was happy with their order.  Those are not good odds.  Maybe we expected too much because they were voted best in Las Vegas.  Maybe the rest of us ordered the worst things on the menu?  It is a very large menu with so many choices.  My wife ordered Pho and was disappointed.  I ordered a Roasted Chicken with rice dish, and the chicken tasted bland.  Well, 7 out of 8 of us will not return here anytime soon.  There are much better options in Las Vegas.",

They pile on the meats but don't give you enough noodles. They are generous with the vegetables - I asked for extra basil and limes, and they gladly gave me a small plateful.   We came late night at around 11pm, and there was a waiting list and full lobby. It took about 20 minutes for my table of 10 to get seated; our order was taken within 5 minutes and came out in the next 10 minutes. The service is fast but not attentive.

Noodles and rare steak are great, but I HIGHLY recommend adding meatballs to any pho you get. Probably the best meatball in pho I've had.  Egg Rolls ($6.50) How can you order pho without egg rolls.

    "text": "Sadly, this is the only place I could think of for a quick bite after seeing MJ's One;   with a name like Kim Long you're not gonna forget it.  I think this place is actually pretty dirty, even by HITW Asian standards.  I've been to a lot of better pho places back in LA, I just need to do some homework and find a decent one in LV for times like this...  The Cha Gio were pretty underwhelming this time <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#bpK7ABzgxpEl6glygmTeVw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>, maybe I just had better since, I prefer the skin more blistery and I thought the lettuce that they provide was skinny and lousy as a wrap.  We had come for pho;  she had the Tai Chin <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#1MGZgHDAINHBderfgHoVsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a> and I most likely had the Tai Nam <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#buNffcMFze-AhvrBxGy2ag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>.  Both were unremarkable and I forgot to ask for the rare beef on the side so naturally they were overcooked...  I'm pretty much over this place, I just need to find another place;  even the name that used to made me chuckle, now it just sounds stupid...",

My parents wanted to come here specifically for it, so we ordered 3 bowls. The sauce they gave with it is SO yummy, better than the broth itself, unfortunately. This time, the bun bo hue lacked flavor. I was hoping for pork blood inside because that's usually how I see it served but nada. Disappointment this time around.  Pho Tai Sac ($7.75): Not bad! I ordered the small bowl and after 10-15 minutes of eating, my bowl looked like it had not been touched. It was like a magical bowl of never ending noodles! I didn't know how to stop it. I ate a little less than half and had to pass it onto my sister & dad to help me finish. Good amount of meat slices.  *BE AWARE OF EXTRA TIPPING!! I had a party of 5 and we automatically got a 18% gratuity charge!",

The establishment is pretty clean and spacious, although the tables are arranged in close proximity to each other so it's definitely not a quiet place.   I had the rare steak pho with spring rolls on the side. Even with a small, I felt full. Their noodle portions are generous. I'll ask for the rare steak on the side next time though, because it was a little dry when it reached my table. Other than that, everything was cheap and delicious.   Totally coming back here when I'm near the strip. I think it's also worth noting that their menu is extensive, so if you don't like pho I'm sure there will be something else to enjoy.",

They have a big black bucket and they just scoop the water from that bucket into the cups! The water does not come from the soda fountain! I am sure that is health code violation. There are more to this horrible experience. This visit reminded me of why I never come here. My boyfriend ordered pho and I just had salt and pepper chicken wings with rice. My chicken wings came up first and I had to wait 20 min for my rice so I could not eat my chicken, by the time it arrived my chicken was already cold. While my boyfriend waited for his pho for 30 minutes, while we watched everyone who ordered after us get their pho right away! The server had an attitude too! I will NEVER come back here ever again no matter how much I'm starving. Overall HORRIBLE SERVICE and DISGUSTING restaurant. Negative stars if I could rate this place.",

Tonight we had the calamari and I swear they served more before? I may be wrong but it came out looking pretty lame. No flavor and it wasn't even hot. We waited for the server to come around and finally after calling him over, we told him we didn't like it. To which he replies with why didn't you tell me sooner so i could make you a new one? It's almost finished. What do you want to do with it?  Hm okay. As a server the first thing I say to my guests is \"I apologize it's not up to par. Could I get you another one? Or is there anything else I can get for you?\" And we had to ask the bussers to call him over!  Maybe it's asking for too much from this place. Then the manager? comes around later with the same plate saying it's almost gone and asks us if we still want it??? Wtf?? WE DON'T LIKE IT NOR WANT IT.  Super disappointed. Don't expect service. If anything, go when you're drunk so you don't notice how bad everything is.",

We got a table within a few minutes of waiting. We ordered the special pho and honey walnuts shrimps. The pho was good and the honey walnuts shrimps was good. They have over 130 food items for you to choose if you prefer not getting pho. The services was decent and friendly. The parking here can be hassle since it limited parking.

This place was jammed packed and you know as well as I know, that's always a great sign. The hostess was incredibly sweet and very talkative, which I loved.  I really surprised we were sat at our tables as fast as we were. I thought for sure it was going to be a long wait. I had the special combination tender beef pho.... OMG .... just simply delicious, no other way to say it. The broth was so tasty and delicious. The different varieties of beef and the noodles was just out of this world. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "This is my go to Pho place whenever I am craving a late night meal in Vegas. It tends of get packed throughout the night, so expect around a 15 minutes wait during most weekends. The Pho broth and noodles are both delicous. The egg rolls were crispy and tasted perfect when dipped in fish sauce.  I have came here at least 5-6 times, and the food has always been good. The only complaint is the service here, which tends to be slow or non-existence. The service becomes great when they are trying to get you to leave. They will bring you the bill before you ask for it. Start taking bowls and plates away within the minute you finish.   There are plenty of parking in the plaza. Last time I went Aug-2018, prices were 8.95 a Pho bowl  TL:DR, Great food, Plenty of Parking, Bad Service.",

They are open 24 hours a day which is great! Not only do they have delicious pho, but the other foods on the menu are just as delicious such as the Mongolian Beef. This place definitely speaks for itself with the crowd that passes through. Do not get discouraged by the waiting list and amount of people you see waiting, it goes by really fast. The prices are very affordable. I highly recommend Pho Kim Long for all of your Vietnamese food cravings!",

    "text": "There are some places that surprise you, and this place doesn't! A seeming fusion of southern Chinese cuisine and Vietnamese comfort food can launch the restaurant only so far in the road of intrigue without diminishing the quality of either influences.   My minute samplings of the Chinese dishes were satisfying enough, but I'll limit my review to my portions only. I'd admit the Chinese orders are infinitely more alluring and aromatically than the Vietnamese counterparts, but it's safe to assume the defining element of this establishment is the rare availability of pho and vermicelli in wee late hours. Arriving on a busy Sunday noon time, the wait was still minimal, yet the service was quick and buzzing. There are parking available in the plaza lot, and also plentiful restroom stalls inside in the back.  -Pho Tai Gan: Although this specific dish is not on the menu, you can order pho with the sliced rare steak and tendon. There are only a few pieces of tendon, and the soup base was too light and hinges on the flavorless side, instead of the rich, umami taste I expected for pho.  -Bun Bo Hue: The broth was a translucent and lack a  clear distinctly sour and salty flavour that distinguishes what is supposed to be a thick red colour soup base. There are three pork knuckles or leg pieces in there, but what I do enjoy is the yummy shrimp chili paste condiment with an in-house-made taste.   Food: 2.5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Environment: 3.5/5",

This is probably the second Pho restaurant that I've been to that seems to like to push it's limit in estranged humor.  The food was delicious, and though I must say that it is hard to mess up Pho like it's hard to mess up a burger, you definitely can taste the difference.  However; PKL does not meet that standard.  There are a lot of Pho chains out there, and PKL is decent in that regards.  They are open late at night and good for some midnight cravings after a night of gambling if you're a tourist.  Or whatever you happen to be in Vegas for.  There is a bathroom, service is decent, and I have and probably will visit this place quite often.  knocked a star mostly on my preference, when I go to these places, there has to be some cheap gimmick that pulls me either with something free or some kick butt pho.  the name in it of itself just doesn't cut it for me ;)",

I went with a small pho ga with white meat and sadly give it a 3 stars due to lack of taste in the broth and stinginess on the chicken!

But, once you find your dish of choice they will have you hooked. Personally I love 12 and 16. They are noodle bowls with beef. I like to add the fresh mint they give on the side.  For a drink i highly recommend their Thai ice tea. Also, if I had to recommend a time of day i would say late night. 2am? No problem!",

I have had dinner here several times and most of their items are tasty so its depressing that their pho is crap.   As far as authenticity goes, if you go back to Vietnam you have to eat on a little table with flies every where if you want real pho. So just be happy the place is clean and there is some sort of service. Its good for your average filler meal before you go out and spend a bunch of money on some celebrity chef restaurant.",

But I stand by my statement that this is probably the best Pho I've had.  I try to come here at least once every other vegas trip, once me and my buddies came here twice in 1 day, before and after clubbing, its just good.  One word of advice, the XL bowl is really that, EXTRA large, I normally finish my bowl or my rice dish and the rest of my gf's bowl, but man, I couldn't finish the XL bowl.  The broken rice dish here is ok, nothing crazy special, same with the egg rolls, the wait is pretty long on Sundays in the 11-12 time, I guess its a good hang over food before you head back home.  This place is also open 24 hours so you can come here at 4am and get the goods, its also a nice pick me up after losing a bunch of money on the tables.",

The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!",

To improve- cleanliness, customer service (understandable that Pho restaurant don't emphasize on the service as much as American ones).",

The pork feet is almost nonexistent and there wasn't much meat after that. It's called BUN Bo Hue because there's supposed to be vermicelli noodles which is a thicker rice noodle than the typical pho noodle. Just very bland and disappointing. I feel like the service is lacking terribly too. No one came to check on us within the 20 minutes after us getting our food because I really wanted some extra chili garlic sauce to add to my mess of a bowl. They can do better.",

All of the employees and the owner were unpleasant as they do not like to smile or even try. NONE of the employees were Vietnamese, except for the owner. It definitely wasn't authentic Vietnamese food, especially when they had Chinese fusion dishes.   I am Vietnamese and I can tell you that this is probably the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've gone to. The food was not fresh or appetizing. It was bland and overpriced. I actually lost my appetite before I was full. The busser asked if we needed boxes while we were still eating. It was rude and they weren't even busy.  At the very least, I can tell you that their facility appeared to be clean and their iced coffee was decent, but not strong. Overall, I would never come to eat here again. I'd rather eat Top Ramen. At least it has flavor.",

There's an aquarium plus this section against the wall that almost looks like a greenhouse without the plastic coverings.  Then the wall works...  it's a WOW!  The interior decorating is attractive Asian art.  I couldn't help staring at their money tree while waiting to be seated.  So there is a plant called a money tree.  But this restaurant had like folded money art hanging from plant trees.  I believe that is some symbol for prosperity of their business.  That is actually True; evident in the numerous people waiting, the well kept well designed interior.  We had about a 15 minute wait, but when we were seated I saw several open tables toward the back.  Not sure what was going on with their table seating management cuz there were plenty people standing to wait.  Perhaps they lack servers as well and didn't have the manpower.    Except that our food came out pretty quick.  After being seated and already eating, I can see the activity going on was fast paced.  The kitchen was full staffed it seems.  Our food was great nothing wrong with presentation, or overcooked or blandness.  I just didn't like all the tendons in my soup.  I swear too our server would drop off food, very short or no interaction.  Only announced what the order was, set it down, and disappeared.  I get it they're extremely high volume.  But I'd like to be able to comment oh kind, friendly, or patient whatever... not enough interaction to mention.  The menu had great selections too for pho, rice plates, appetizers... A fast meal, good food, nice set up.  Just enjoy it for what you're there for - to eat.",

    "text": "first thing first is all the negative comments about this restaurant is completely True.   It's only getting a one star rating because of being seated was quick and I didn't have to wait long especially coming in with a party of 6. I had dined here with my son , hubs , & the in laws three of us order their pho I forgot which one but I got the pho ga (chicken pho) since I was craving for it . My son got com tam which is pork chop with rice and veggies and an egg cake that came along with it while the SIL order their house special fried rice and the hub got the 'bird nest'. As we were waiting for the food all I could think about is being able to enjoy my broth and dipping my chicken into the fish sauce but as soon as I got my food I was very shocked . What the hell is this ?! My pho looked so weird .. the broth was okay .. the noodle tasted like some cheap noodle brand and the chicken was chicken breast ... what the hell ??? seriously ?!! Pho kim long you guys couldn't even throw in the other pieces of meat ?? Chicken is so cheap yet you guys charge so much for freaking chicken breast that was so damn dried ?!?! also they threw in red onion for my pho which was really weird .. I've been to many different pho restaurant and seeing that just caught me off guard. My sons food came out to be beef instead of pork chops but he didn't care because he thought it tasted good besides his egg cake which had no flavor to it even though he had extra fish sauce to dip it in. The FIL didn't care much cause he was too hungry so he ended up finishing his meal while the MIL barely touched her bowl . The hubs order looked like a bird took a crap on it while everything was just thrown on and it was super soggy when it's suppose to be crunchy and had one piece of beef along with some chicken breast meat lolol . The SIL fried rice was so plain when it was suppose to be their house special to the point she had to add so much soy sauce for flavor lol . The food was just so bad in general and so expensive.. I don't mind paying for quality food but in this case it was not worth it at all!   Lastly , when it was time to pay the bill the waiter had the nerves to come and ask which part of the meal did we want to pay gratuity for like serious ?! Who does that ?!?!   Never again will I ever dine here , I highly suggested everyone not to either I don't know how this place is surviving maybe it's because they're open late and everyone whose drunk comes here thinking it's good ? who knows . NEVER AGAIN",

If I have to be honest, the main reason why I even wanted to try the place was because of the name.

Last time, I made mention of the broth because I didn't think it was as flavorful as Pho joints in LA. I can say that based on my most recent experience, it was everything I was hoping for...Perfection!  The staff made sure our water glasses stayed full (fail from last time)....but the biggest difference is the remodel.  This place looks like a brand new restaurant! Before, it seemed like your typical ethnic restaurant, but they've really cleaned this place up, and added plenty of seating. My guess is they took out whatever business was next door.  Since this place IS open 24/7, it's the perfect spot when you are craving Pho after a big night out.  Funny side note....at 3:30am, the guy that seats you, is a cop. Badge and all. Pretty awesome.",

We were seated immediately, the Vietnamese coffee we ordered came in about a minute, and we received our meal and appetizer in about 5-10 minutes. The service was friendly and they checked up on us just the right amount in the short time we were there (we were in a bit of a rush, but still wanted to go to a sit-down restaurant).   The bowl of pho was quite good and big enough to leave the three of us full without the appetizer. We ordered some of the shrimp rolls, which were also very tasty. They brought us soy sauce and sriracha (which is good for just about anything you order), and it was a good value overall.  In summary: -FAST, friendly service -Good value -Nice atmosphere",

Probably the rude hostess and her friends working there did something. Rachelle the hostess was THE WORST at checking in and seating customers. if you see a lady with red hair and blue eyes, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. She never greeted any of the guests, and even worse, she let the only 1 guy who just came through the door get a table when me and three other families were waiting for 20 minutes!! She was flirting with that one guy for some time while she ignored the 3 other families were waiting to get checked in! When one father was getting mad at her not paying attention and flirting with the guy, and checking his family in, she had the most disgusting attitude and told him to wait- terrible at customer service. Also, when i called her out and asked why we were all waiting longer than other people, she had the audacity to tell me off by saying to eat somewhere else. Oh and not to mention that she didn't even give the family seated next to us any menus whatsoever. Talk about lazy service. What a shame. I've been going here faithfully for years and service is going down the drain. Did I forget to say how it took me FIVE times to call a waiter to get boxes for my leftovers? And don't expect anybody checking you frequently to see if your dining experience. They clearly made eye contact with me and ignored me, particularly the ones whom the hostess would be talking to. She's turning this restaurant into a high school vibe with all the rude and immature employees. it's ridiculous. The one star is only for the nice lady who checked on our waters and my family enjoyed their pho. Best vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas, what a lie. Go to any other pho place but this! The service gets worse and worse and i finally can't take coming here anymore! I hate this place with a passion now! If you are one of the employees and you read this, remember: we customers pay your pay check. No respect, no money. no customers. You lost 4 faithful families of customers tonight. And earned a visit from a health inspector for the bad quality food you  gave my family. Hope you like That Visit as your early Christmas present.",

The Fridays and Saturday late night crowd is comprised of people who look like they just got out of clubbing and are trying to cure their drunkenness with a hot bowl of Pho.  (which totally works by the way!)  Sunday lunch is always crowded with a good mix of tourists and locals.  Besides Pho, try the Chicken Wings with Kim Long Sauce....or as I'd like to call it, \"magic sauce\".... Thai tea with boba is great, but there's a 50/50 chance your boba may be hard.  And at $4 a cup, it's pricey.",

I got the chicken pho & @ first glance, it lacked EVERYTHING. I guess l get too spoiled living in Orange County, California with quality fresh cheap authentic pho on every corner.  They skimped on ALL veggies especially scallions, culantro, thai basil, & white onion. Broth was below average. At least I had the option to choose big rice noodles after I requested it. The measly dry chicken BITS were floating around in the murky water. At other places, when you order chicken pho, these are the questions the waiter would ask you (but this place didn't):  -What bowl size? -What noodle size? -White or dark meat? -Do you want chicken skin on your meat? -Do you want gizzards? (Liver, Coagulated blood, heart, eggs, etc.)  HOISIN SAUCE!!! Watered down, much? It was runny, light brown, and extra salty-like a teriyaki sauce! How can you even manage to eff that up too? Wow...  Opt for elsewhere, please. We made the mistake of choosing that place because later after some driving around, we saw plenty of other pho restaurants on the same street. Cheaper too, albeit.

I don't really comprehend why we do, we just do.  Actually, here or some other Asian restaurant in \"Chinatown\" - but as of late, mostly here.  Last visit, we arrived at 8:00 pm driving from Grand Canyon, so we were all beat.  Surprisingly, the restaurant was packed so we waited approximately 10 minutes.  I found it strange that they have a \"smoking section\" of the restaurant, but that area isn't blocked off.  Wide variety of selections on the menu.  I think the only Vietnamese food they serve are pho and the dessert.  Everything else is pretty much from the Chinese/Cantonese culture, which is why I don't understand why their restaurant name is in Vietnamese.  Oh well.  Stuff is average - pretty good at times.  Not the best pho I've ever tasted, but will suffice during a late night craving of Vietnamese food.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  Oh, and one of the waiters is pretty cute :)",

I was here a couple nights ago with some friends. We weren't catered to which was fine since we didn't need much, but when we did finally need something our waiter was no where to be found. So I attempted to asked an employee who was wiping down a table next to us to go grab our waiter knowing that he was not our waiter, and almost instantaneously he starts saying \"I'm not a waiter, I'm not a waiter!\" like.... no kidding I was going to ask you to grab ours because we wanted to order something else. So he does so and we aren't attended to for the rest of the night. Once we are about to go up to the cashier to pay we are all just waiting because there is a person ahead of us. As we're waiting we can all clearly and concisely hear the cashier telling off one of his coworkers using his walkie talkie.. I guess they lost track of which customer they received $40 from..",

I actually prefer the ones in NYC Chinatown, and i feel like the bowls in NYC are bigger. I have to admit that i am a fan of their vietnamese iced tea. That's about it.   I had the pho with rare roast beef and well done flank. I mean it was okay...Just no wow factor. The bowl itself wasn't that filling. I killed it and felt like I could have eaten more if wanted to.  Our server also sucked. We ordered some cha gio. At 1st the waiter had no idea what we wanted. This guy actually didn't even know the menu period. We would want something, and then he'd be like errr lemme look at the menu. What a fool. Then when we incorrectly pronounced the cha gio, he gave us this weird look and then walked away. Then he didn't even punch it into the computer., so we never got it. Terrible service!!!  Granted this place is cheap..but it's just whatever. I have had better.",

    "text": "I was in town last month for edc.  I'm from NY, so we have some pretty decent pho.  The best is still the one my sister and mom makes.  Pho Kim Long definitely hit the spot.  I was hesitant at first to pick this spot.  Many of the previous reviews had mentioned about the waiters being rude.  We are from New York, we know what rude is!! We didn't have any problem here.    Deco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.  Food:  I had the pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.    Service: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it.",

What's worse is the people that worked there didn't even ask the customers to move out of the way. One by one three customers stepped in front of me. Two of them were females wearing heels!

I had a lady just walked in, talked to the host, and she got the table for her total 7 people despite she was the only person that showed up at that time. She had no reservation. There were 4 other customers in front of her; each customer is between party of 2 to 4. We were pushed back on the queue just because our party was not as big.

Good service here.  3). I've only had the pho and spring rolls here, and they're both bomb, baby.   PHO_  Pho is really filling, I always get the rare steak and brisket. The broth is very flavorful, lots of rice noodles, and about Palm-size amount of meat. Comes with the array of limes, bean sprouts, Thai basil. So good!  SPRING ROLLS_ Spring rolls were tasty! They came out fresh, still warm from the kitchen. I'm glad these doodads were already assembled and sliced up, because my friends were way to drunk to make them themselves.

When we came from the bathroom (it's takes no more than five minutes) i'll table was cleaned up. I was so hungry and my son I'm pretty sure he was hungrier. I'm just curious if the waiter or the waitress are so anxious to clean the table... shouldn't they look because the receipt is on the table and The food was barely touch but it was chopped up due to my son he could not to a bigger piece of the pork chops on top of that the water cup was and Thai tea was still full. That should ring the bell. One of the server team and apologize and hand me the receipt so me being a good citizen walked to the register and proceed paying for our breakfast. I could have told them that I want a table in my foods back but the fear of them preparing my food and spitting in it (not saying that they would do that). This matter was very very poor handle.

Yes, the hype on this place is a little over-the-top but I can understand, their pho broth is #1 and Pho Saigon 8 is #2 to my taste buds! Can't beat them, they're just too delicious. I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).  Their prices have increased over the years but their taste still gives them the huge reputation they have. Sometimes my visits vary a bit with them when it comes to their service; either they're really awesome and friendly OR they're lifeless and non-attentive. Asides that, I suggest you give this place a visit so you can decide whether or not Pho Kim Long lives up to their name.",

On the strip, there's the pho place in TI, but it's $15 and not that good. This isn't too far from the strip so it's pretty perfectly located.  I wouldn't say this is the best pho or anything like that. But it's pho and for about $8 a bowl. Sounds similar to prices at home in San Francisco for me.   The place is clean and looks pretty modern in style. Lots of tables but there can be a wait during lunch time. But we only waited about 10 minutes on a Monday afternoon, which isn't too bad.   By the way, say the name \"Pho Kim Long\" fast & see if you get what the name really is ;)",

The Good  -Establishment is big lots of seating and its open 24 hours.  -I had the Singapore Noodles both times and it was good.  The service is okay.  The Bad  -When I first walked in there are fish tanks in the restaurant, they were in serious need of cleaning it was really really bad.    -The floor around many of the tables had napkins and food on it, which to me is a huge no no.  -the bathrooms were hideous both the men (which I used) and the women (which my friend used)  Overall I wouldn't recommend this place to my family or friends. I feel if a restaurant can't keep the floors, or bathrooms clean then the kitchen is not clean.  The Fish tanks were just awfully dirty.  Many people who need some place to eat at night go here. I would consider it drunk food since at night most every customer has been drinking and there is lots of noise.",

The soup was tasty and I was able to make it spicy as hell because they give you a plate of sprouts, jalapeno, and herbs to season it with. The noodles were plentiful and perfect. I'm holding back on giving it five stars only because I haven't had a lot of Pho before and for all I know this isn't even close to as good as it gets.",

I also ordered the cha gio and instead of using the viet rice paper to wrap it, they used the chinese style egg roll wrapper. Never would I come back here again. Not even when I'm starving!

I should have gone for the pho but I've had my share in college when I live in Orange County. Instead, I opted for the bahn mein which was not the best I've ever had. It was quite mediocre as I've had better elsewhere.  Since it was searing hot outside, I opted to get a mango smoothie with tapioca and was expecting fresh mangos for a $4.75 drink. Boy did they serve up a powered monstrosity which I took two sips of. I hate powdered drinks when fresh fruit should have been in order.",

I agree, wait staff come off as rude, but I think its just a language/culture clash. I have to say I love the pho here...maybe since it was my first pho experience and I compare all others to it. The broth is very clean and flavorful. I like mine with egg noodle instead of rice noodle, which makes it more substantial. I've tried various other dishes and haven't had one I didn't liike yet. My only complaint is rice does not come with many dishes...wtf!, this is an Asian restaurtant how could it not. Having to pay extra for rice seems a little nickle and dimey, but I guess you're at their mercy since it is impossible not to eat rice with your meal here. Besides that, I do make a monthly trip here cause the food is great.",

The crispy noodles with vegetables were tasty, the sauce work well with the crunchy noodles.  The combination fried rice was pretty standard, you really can't mess it up.  The killer item was the honey garlic pork chops.  Normally I like to get the fried crispy pork chops, but something about it just made me order it.  It was extremely crispy and seasoned well.    Pho Kim Long offers traditional chinese/vietnamese food that is hard to find on the Strip.  Definately check this place out for some good grub.",

I got that part but let me think about this for a sec. If I spend $75.00 on two burgers, two orders of fries, and two sodas at the Mirage, I expect my meal to be damn near fantastic. It wasn't though. Yet, everything happens for a reason and I think that reason was to find Pho Kim Long.  After taking a cab ride to a Wells Fargo location to pull some funds out, the cab driver gave the terrific recommendation of this place and I'm so glad he did. What a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! This place is amaze-ballzzzz. Just to put things in perspective, I spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:  2 bowls of Pho 2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut 2 iced coffees 1 order of egg rolls  I was mad full afterwards and fully rehydrated afterwards.  Luckily, I entered the restaurant right before their lunch rush so waiting for a table took all of two minutes before they said they had a table ready. During my almost week long stay in Vegas, I think I visited this place about three times and every time it was always full of people. From what I hear, this is the place to be come 4, 5, 6 in the morning but I don't have time for that nonsense. It was perfect at 10:30/11 a.m. for me. Honestly, the cab ride to and from and the entire meal each time was well worth the money.",

The porridge arrived soooo late and its the easiest thing to make and should be ready in minutes. We all finished our meal and he was still waiting on his!

I haven't had pho in awhile, and this was definitely one of the better places I've been to in a long time, and you know how many pho places there are in the South Bay.  The broth was great, the meat tender, and the noodles light yet hearty and filling.  I had a serious hangover after the NYE festivities, and I had to drive the way back to LA.  I don't doubt that having a belly full of good pho helped me recuperate.",

You would think that would mean that the food might suck, but no, the pho here was great.  I'm not a big fan of pho cause I think there are better vietnamese dishes to be had.  So if I think it's good, that's saying a lot.  Granted, I had a huge hangover from the night before, but the broth here was delicious.  The rare steak was tender, and the tendons were good.  The texture of the noodles were also very good.  Not too soft, and not too hard.  I was the first of my friends to finish and I devoured it.    We also ordered spring rolls here.  It was tasty, but would have been better if it was served with noodles and lettuce.    We came during lunch time on a Sunday afternoon.  The line was ridiculously long, but the best part was that once we ordered our food, it was served within 5 minutes or less.    The waiter was also kinda funny.  Who knew...  Oh...and they're open 24 hours.  Will have to revisit after a hard night of Vegas drunkeness.  Beats pho at the TI by 100x.",

Pho is really good - broth is tasty and pretty addicting and not too salty but definitely full of MSG which explains the minus 1 star Eggrolls are my personal go to item because I don't really like pho  Waiting wise, it gets crowded during lunch and around..1AM-2AM?

I SEE AN OPEN TABLE WITH ONE CHAIR.  I patiently wait for 12 minutes while only one other party, four people were sat, in this time span. There's still about 5 groups ahead of me waiting for a table.  All parts of 3/ 4 people. I politely ask the host if I can have that open table for ONE , the small table with only one chair at it. He said I have to wait for my manager to give the go ahead to seat people. I ask the manager if I could sit there and order as its only me. He said no I have to wait , there's people ahead of me.  I explained the other parties are of 3-4 people , and they would not even be using the ONE TOP TABLE. He said no I have to wait. At this rate I would probably be waiting at least another 30 minutes to be sat. Unacceptable ! I scan the dining room and there were plenty of tables open to accommodate everyone that was waiting in the lobby. At least get the customers in the seat and beverages as opposed to waiting in the lobby area and outside. Obviously no confidence in their waitstaff to handle a little pressure of a busy dining room floor. Sad to say but you've lost a customer , will take business and recommend business down the street to Viet Noodle Shop. Hope management gets a clue on how to run the dining room floor.  Pathetic",

People at a neighboring table ordered calamari -- rats!  that's what we should have gotten -- and it looked great.  Instead, to complete our light dinner we chose mapo tofu. Although they were a bit stingy with the pork, there was enough tofu to take back for a second meal.  I thought the service was fine, the restaurant attractive; all in all a good place to eat.",

The pho did not have that pungent aroma that I've experienced at other places, and the service the times I've been there have not been the greatest.

They seem to be the only restaurant around that isn't ridiculously overpriced and offers many options. Vermicelli noodles, rice dishes (not com tam/broken rice though), ph, soup, etc.  I've been here twice because my dad only enjoys viet food. My first visit I tried their mi xoa Kim long (crispy egg noodle house stir-fry) . It wasn't that good. Too sweet and not enough savory. Oily and most of the noodles where already soggy by the time it got to me. And a small variety of vegetables too. This morning I tried com bo luc lac(shaking beef and rice). It completely lacked flavor and the rice tasted dirty. It's presentation did not look like it was worth $12.50 either. Plus I ordered an egg which came out fully cooked(I wanted sunny side up), broken (I'm a perfectionist), in a pool of oil(plain nasty), and 7 minutes after my rice plate came out(wtf?). My parents order one of Kim Long's more popular dishes. Canh chua (sour soup) and ca kho do(braised fish clay pot).  The soup was sour as expected, the fish tasted fresh and clean so this was good The fish clay pot as overly seasoned with oyster sauce so I wasn't a fan.  Service was mediocre. Basic viet service by people who weren't viet ...?  Overall, I was disappointed with Kim Long. Sorry.",

I had NO idea what to order.  I looked around me and the girl next to me had something that looked interesting.  She was sitting by herself and looked like she was really enjoying her meal.  I asked the waiter what is she eating.  He said Honey Garlic Pork Chop.  So hubby and I ordered that and shared it with two orders of rice.  OMG!!!! It was amazing.  It was probably one of the best things ever.  I highly recommend that you just TRY IT.  You got nothing to lose while in Vegas (foodwise).  Anyways, even hubby was skeptical and was like what the heck are you ordering just based on what the next table is eating.  He loved it.  We are foodies and have pretty good palates.  We loved it.   Only complaint is that they charge per serving of rice.  To me this is almost unheard of for a Viet restaurant.  I was very surprised but they give you a decent amount.  However, come on...it's like charging for bread at an Italian restaurant or salsa at a Mexican restaurant or pita at a Greek place or Naan at an Indian restaurant.  It's just not done.  So, one star off for this.   However, I still highly recommend since the entree was so good and they are open 24 hrs.",

Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious.   We ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist.

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE!!! I don't usually write bad reviews but place this deserves ZERO stars. They increased and over charged everything on the menu. While eating we were already disappointed how terrible the food was compared to before.   When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.  I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here.   Steam chicken $26 Ca Kho To $18.90 Canh Chua $18.90 Coconut (not fresh) $5.50 Fried Tofu (4 )  $10 Rice - $15 for a bucket   Vietnames food should not be this expensive. This place is NOT an upscale restaurant. I rather spend this amount at a Thai, Japanese,  or other upscale restaurants. Coconut is usually $2.50, Ca Kho To is usually under $10. If the food was superb, I don't mind paying for it but it wasnt.",

The food ive had here several times. its one of the only pho joints open 24/7 and plus after raging in vegas coming here is a perk. instead of eating crap a$$ food on the strip or your hotel food court.   The pho ga is my favorite here. The spring rolls are decent next time i come to vegas im def hitting another pho joint to get a good compare. If you have the time just go to Lotus of Siam Beautiful Thai food. If not this is WAY better than eating dirt on the strip late night.",

They do have delicious pho and the broth is really good but this place at most times has a long wait or their servers are not as attentive as you'd like them to be. The past five times I came in our server didn't come back to refill our drinks or when we would wave them down they say they'd come but never end up coming. So my past five visits my party and I dined in without our waters being refilled. Then when you're wrapping up the servers who are hard to wave down for water suddenly quickly bus our tables and give us our checks. They're not even focused on closing with you as a customer because they're already focusing on the next party that they are about serve. So this place is a good for their food, I recommend taking something to go instead of dining in. It is much easier and quicker for yourself as a customer.",

    "text": "Most well known pho place I know of. All of my friends have at least been here once, i've been here multiple times late at night, and even for lunch. I've experienced pho at many other restuarants and can say Pho Kim Long is just about average.    My most recent visit was yesterday. As it was hot, i didn't feel like ordering something too hot like a soup or rather pho. I wasn't too hungry either, so i ordered Pan friend udon, yes I know, a Pho place wouldn't specialize in it, but another place i've been to had superb udon.  It was around 3pm when i arrived and there was a good amount of people. Glad to see they're still getting service. I walked in and it took me 10 minutes just to get seated. Like i said there was a good amount of people, it wasn't packed or very busy. Once i got a table i browsed the menu, already knowing what i wanted, udon. I eye'd the waiter down or rather signaled him to come over and he looked away, but he did eventually come around after 15 minutes of waiting. I ordered my chicken pan fried udon and he went on his merry way.   The order came faster than i expected took about 3 to 5 minutes aha. Not bad. I tasted my first mouthfull. Not bad, but not good either. It was very tasteless. I put some sauce on there, it made it better but i could still taste that blandness in the noodles. Nearing the end of the dish, I noticed a lot of bean sprouts leftover. I like beansprouts and i tend to eat those first but there was still a lot and it watered down the sauce so much that it just tasted like water after eating most of the udon.  Again, I suppose having udon at a pho place isn't ideal, but i wasn't feeling up to having a hot soup on a hot noon day. Perhaps at dinner?   This was an average day, i was full after eating, but wasn't satisfied with how it tasted. Eat anything but the udon!",

Me and my boyfriend order was $46.xx but was round to $50 exact. Everyone else (3 other couples) was round and charged $36 exact. We ordered the exact same thing but me and my boyfriend ordered like 2-3 more items. We didn't even noticed we got over charged by $16 until we got to our hotel  Next time calculate your total before you even pay next time-.-",

All my nights in Vegas are filled with a blur of major partying and drinking, while my mornings are filled with puking my brains out. Although I don't want to eat anything when I'm that hungover, I gotta say that Pho is the best cure.  Don't expect Pho comparable to the likes of Westminster, but it'll do. Just order your pho, drink lots of water, and try to sober up for another night of drinking!  PS: I heard it's open 24 hours, but I've never been here after the club. I'm too busy craving Steak & Eggs at that time! ;)",

TARO MANGO MIX. MMMMM! DONT EVER TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT MIX STUPID DUMASSES\"  what an experience that was for me and everyone else in the restuarant...  lol",

I keep it simple by ordering the pho w/ rare steak.  My friend always gets the spring rolls which comes with a delicious peanut sauce.  The thai iced tea is also bomb.  This place is our tradition before driving home.  Always!",

That being said, I have tried other vietnamese food restaurants and some broths are overpowering.  I happened upon Pho Kim Long by driving up Spring Mountain in the Chinatown area and decided to give it a try. We are greeted usually immediately, seated at a table, and given menus. The floorspace is open, a mix of 4top tables and larger round family size tables. We are quickly brought water while we look at the menu. We normally order pho tai (rare steak slices that quickly cook in the hot broth) or pho tai nam (rare steak with well done flank) along with chinese broccoli and garlic. It averages taking 5-10 minutes to get our soup and a few minutes more to get our broccoli.  Fruit smoothies with tapioca are available, as well as fresh coconut drinks, soda, juices, and asian style beverages. The menu is extensive with various dishes, noodles, rice, beef, seafood, chicken and vegetarian entrees. The spring rolls are fresh and tasy! I come here often, and need to branch out on the menu!",

    "text": "Well, where do I begin. Pains me to even ponder it, but the tale needs to be told.  Over the ages during my travels, Pho Kim Long has always been at the pinnacle of my destination. I will admit, it always satisfied the cravings of hunger and thirst in any direction I saw fit. From the delicious boba filled smoothies all the way down to the crab rangoons. Pho had it all. Seasoned rice young men and women dear for? Check. Charbroiled meats of the finest qualities? Check. Tap water with the temperature colder than the iceberg that sunk the titanic? CHECK. CHECK. CHECK. And boy, I would stand by this statement for years. My travels have never betrayed me. Until now.  Over the years, I would assume, one would come accustomed to the fine delicacies Pho Kim Long had to offer. However, one could also come to recognize an anomaly, a pattern if you will... if ONE were so inclined to look... that is. I come before you now because I believe I have cracked the code with Pho Kim Long after all these years. I'd be much more frustrated myself if I wasn't so god damn impressed by it. Over years of observation, my research can be concluded as their technique betrays us long before the quality of their food.  At Pho they will serve you, get you your food as quick as possible, and once your sustenance arrives (hopefully all of it, at once), you're forgotten. Betrayed. Left behind, with no one to tell your tale. The tale of a  man or women served the finest beverages and cuisines, only to never be heard from again. This is Pho Kim Longs practice. Their establishment runs off the assumptions of those dining in, and this is such a practice that may satisfy only the hungry, but not the ones weary from long travels such as myself. We seek more than just satiation. We look for the service of refilled iceberg sinking cold water every chance we get, but instead it never comes. The story is even more disheartening when you can see a tray absolutely stacked with those waters you lusted so long for to begin with. I couldn't understand Pho's reasoning for this, as water, is \"essential to life\" and the prime of a servants responsibilities.   But if you want this story to stop at the water, I'm afraid it just doesn't. My time before this had their famous wings containing the pinkest of meats I've ever sawed. And as I've said from the beginning, it pains me a great deal as I have looked upon my travels for years and with ease and optimism as Pho had always been the tip of the iceberg that would quench my thirst and satisfy all hopes and my every demands. But it just isn't there anymore. You're served and then forgotten. I will spare you the finer details, as I believe you just aren't ready to digest them. When your last few visits aren't as pleasant as you remember, you will reflect back on this review and analyze what you thought Pho was all these years, and how soon will be a distant memory.  In loving memory of Pho Kim Long. \"Satisfied, but forgotten\"",

    "text": "My stomach hurts so bad as I write this review, I am definitely torching this place.   This place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated.   I'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food.   First offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff.   Second offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick.   Third offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice.   Fourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial.   Fifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now.   Sixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all.   With so many options in Vegas to get Vietnamese food late, this place is not one of them.",

Anywho, I was enjoying my pho for the first time but couldnt enjoy it for long cause my gf who is KOREAN starts telling the vietnamese waitress that the VIETNAMESE iced coffee does not taste like it should and tasted mediciney...her explanation for her expertise over the veitnamese waitress and chefs were that she has had many before and it was not like it.   now Mind you the key word in Vietnamese iced coffee is VIETNAMESE! If I amd eating korean food with a non korean and they start telling me that it does not taste authentic then i would assume 2 things: 1.  They are delusional or.. 2.  The food is actually authentic.  Anyways to combat my girlfriend's 3 star review i give this place 5 stars!!",

Good inexpensive food that can fill you up, no problem. Wait time is a bit long (thus the 4 stars) considering we were there late. Overall, good experience.",

I'm a pretty patient person, I understand places in Vegas can get busy, but it's not hard to quickly check-in with your table and see how they're doing.

I had a bit of pho and the broth seemed to be better.  I don't know if they changed it or it varies from day to day.  I also had the mi xao dong.  it was good but I take forever to eat and the noodles got soggy.  if you're a slow eater like me, get the sauce on the side. ------------------------------------------- UPDATE: 03.21.16  I got the mi xao dong beef again and got the sauce on the side.  I posted a pic of it.  I super recommend doing this!  My noodles stayed crunchy and since the sauce is together in a glass bowl, it stayed hot.  So that was even better.    I'm trying to cut back on eating bad so I ate only 1/4 of the entree.  Waste of money but they don't have a smaller size of this. Sighhh",

I have heard that anything between 3AM - 5AM is hell. The lines are long, all the customers are people that go clubbing, and the atmosphere sucks. I can't speak to that, it's just what I heard! I'll stick with my latest being at 2AM, thanks.   I don't wander when at Pho Kim Long. No experimenting for me! I know what I like from this place and I get pho tai with spring rolls and water.

My friends said that they just HAD to have Pho and that this place was worth the wait so I angrily agreed.  Went to get iced coffee from the Lee's Sandwiches next door, picked up some bread from a nearby bakery, and then we were called to sit down. To my surprise, the wait was only around 20 minutes.  After placing our order, the drinks and food came out almost instantly; as in, everything we ordered was on the table within 5 minutes. I have never had my food come out that fast, but the hangry beast inside of me did not have time to question why or to be skeptical.   I ordered Pho Tai and egg rolls. They both were delicious and quite satisfying. After adding lemon to my Pho Tai, the broth was flavored perfectly to my liking.  The prices are reasonable, the service is lacking but adequate - what you would expect from a very crowded Pho place, but the food comes out quickly and tastes great. I will be back if I ever am in Vegas and in dire need of a good Pho restaurant.",

We got to sit next to one of their two aquarium. We enjoyed the company of the fishes.   Now for the food part. We got their pho, bum bo hue, this beef with rice, and wonton noodle soup. Overall they were good, but not to the point that made us go \"wow\". We had much better Viet/Chinese food, but the service+ environment makes up for it. The best part though was their Thai tea. THE BEST I had so far after trying many places that serves this beverage.   Finally, it was nice that they open 24/7. I read a lot of yelpers liking pho for hangovers. But as a person who isn't big on drinking, it it's still nice to know there is a nice pho restaurant that will serve well any time of the day. Can't go wrong with this place.",

Sometimes the service is quick and on point. They kind of rush you so the next group of people can sit down, though. But, if the wait is 15-20 minutes long, at least let us sit down and enjoy our food for that long. Other times, even if business is slow, the service is slow and poor.

My mom remembered coming here a couple years back and had to come back here for dinner.  (With a myriad of choices, she chose this place!)  Rightfully so, the place was packed and bustling when we entered!  Now, coming from California and the east coast, I have had the extremes of great and worst Vietnamese food.  However, here, they fortunately were in the middle.  I didn't order the pho (I know, bad Vietnamese girl!); rather, another  traditional favorite, I ordered the Vermicelli noodes with pork and egg rolls (translated from above; don't be too impressed, that's the extent of my writing in Vietnamese: just foods!)   :)  It was good--all the fixings of lettuce, mint and basic with bean sprouts and cucumbers.  I enjoyed the prompt service there as well.  The staff isn't all Vietnamese, but they were friendly and speedy. :)  Downside, I think they truly specialize in just Pho, but created at 'Vietnamese diner' style menu, meaning there was just about every Vietnamese dish on the menu and included some Thai dishes.  I don't judge a place for the variety, but it does make me ponder...  Last unfortunate note, the chili container had LOTS of MOLD buildup...Pho Kim Long, please check up on that stuff!  Don't want to see you closed down because of poor handling of foods...

They take your orders, your order arrives shortly after, and they pick up your bowls after you're done eating. I appreciate the speedy service, but I think they need to slow down a bit so they can catch a breather and for us to take our time to enjoy our food. If you like fast service at a nice restaurant, this place is for you. I would definitely come back to Pho Kim Long as my choice of Pho for the next time I go to Vegas.",

    "text": "Pho Kim Long my relationship with you has been great in the past, but on my recent trip something was different, you've changed and I don't think its for the better.  In the past I enjoyed super fast service and everything seemed to be running like a well oiled machine.  On the night I last tasted their delicious pho the machine had thrown a gear, and was stumbling on at 76% efficiency.    I would be in the wrong to rate this restaurant on one experience, but I feel that this restaurant has been going in a bad direction for a little while now, and tonight was the culmination of its backwards inertia.  Although the food in not in question as I think its still great tasting and fairly cheap for what you get.  Service counts, and because its never been stellar per say (the waiters are quick but not friendly), any small change (like to speed lets say) can turn a great place, to just an ok place.  One thing I noticed was the overall disconnect from the workers and front of the house management.  The place wasn't that busy and we still had to put our name on a list to be seated for some reason.  In the past this place would be packed to the gills and we would be seated right away, no problem.  Tonight we waited to be seated for 15 minutes even when it was relatively empty.  This seemed to make the workers who were standing around looking helpless and angry.  At one point I could see them pointing and talking about the host, and probably not in a good way.  Once we did get seated the food did take a little bit longer to come out mostly, I believe, because they were busy talking about the host.    When the food did come it was great as usual, and in all truth is actually one of Vegas's great late night eats.  Now I understand you have to take a place based on what it is, and appreciate that.  What is Pho Kim Long?  Well it's great Pho when you're out late on a Vegas night.  If you keep that in the forefront of your mind, you will enjoy it and forget about its faults.   However if you are taking this eating establishment as a whole, as I am trying to right now, then its shortcomings become apparent.  The truth is Vegas does have a ton of Pho restaurants some with better tasting Pho, and others with better service.  In the end you can call Pho Kim Long average with room for improvement, and you would be fair in saying that.   Will I go back again most defiantly, but I will go there with the understanding that \"it is what it is\".",

Once again due to a lack of public transport in that area and with the wifey famished things began to get desperate and I was fighting for my survival! Suddenly like out of the mist came these 4 young Vietnamese (to me they appeared to be 4 angels) and the wifey followed them into this joint after chatting with them briefly.  I had no time to Yelp this place and my Yelps were drowned with the sounds of my wifeys hunger pangs. I looked around and saw only Vietnamese faces all deeply engrossed in their meals and as no one was texting I knew we hit paydirt! It took a few minutes for our waitress to warm up to us too rather degraggled appearing starving folks but once she did she was very helpful. The wifey ordered the Rice with Grilled Pork and I ordered the Beef pho minus the tendons and we both quietly put our iphones down and were immersed into our dishes!  On finishing one of the best Vietnamese meals we have had in a while I wifey spotted the table next to ours having a Boba and fond memories of our dearest son Kev she had a Mango Boba  in his honour as he did not make the trip with us! I would definitely recommend this place to fellow Yelpers as it seems only the locals know about this place off the Strip!",

The decor is nice and there is a cool fish tank that definitely brings this pho joint up a notch, but the pho itself is slightly over priced and not that amazing.  Maybe I am spoiled having lived so close to Westminster for so long.  I am not saying that this is bad pho at all, I just was not impressed.    The second thing that bothered me was that it took forever to be served and to get our food.  Usually pho only takes a few minutes to get everything in the bowl and then it is in your belly in no time.  I felt like this was the longest pho meal ever.  I probably won't be back anytime soon, unless I really really want pho and I can't find any other pho place to go to.  I expected more Pho Kim Long.  You let me down.",

Their pricing and selection are pretty standard in regards to this type of casual dining restaurant.  I would dare to say that they could improve their quality of service in terms of their hospitality. I only say this because they seem in such a rush that they loose that piece a little, but not on a level that it merits you not checking it out!",

    "text": "Within close proximity of the strip and open 24/7, this place is great for recovering from a drunken stupor or hangover.  To start, I recommend the egg rolls and crab rangoon. Each order of egg rolls comes with 4 rolls, some lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, and fish sauce. The egg rolls are piping hot and extra crispy. Wrap them around some lettuce, garnish with some of the pickled veggies, and dunk it in fish sauce.  The crab rangoon is surprisingly good. They're deep fried wontons filled with cream cheese and imitation crab. The wrapper on the wonton is one of the crispiest I've ever had. The filling is small but pretty tasty. You get the hot, melty, cheesy creaminess of the cream cheese mixed in with decent imitation crab. This is a great bite sized snack while you wait for your pho.  The pho here is satisfactory. The bowls are a bit small and the portions aren't stellar. The broth isn't as hearty or flavorful as you'd want it to be, but it's not bland. There's also a ton of fat in the broth, as evidenced by the copious amount of fat droplets floating around. The noodles are on the softer side, and there isn't the full complement of meats to choose from. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have fatty brisket. If you stick with the classic rare steak and you'll be okay. It's thinly sliced and super tender. Make sure you separate the pieces and swish them around in the broth for a bit to ensure they're cooked. The bowl is finished off with sliced red and white onions, as well as chopped green onions.  Service is friendly and very easy going. Everything we ordered came out quickly. Try to hang out within shouting distance of the main entrance so you don't miss them calling your name when your table is ready.",

The menu is pretty extensive, and I'm sure you can find something that will tickle your fancy. Of course people go there expecting to have pho, but I didn't feel like it that day so I ordered their pan fried noodles.   The Pan fried noodles were Sooooo good! They used thin egg noodles and made them really crispy. The house special one tasted better than the seafood one. The gravy was a bit darker, maybe they used beef broth. The house special had beef, seafood, chicken, and the seafood just had seafood like squid, shrimp, imitation crab and surprisingly fish fillet! Egg rolls were just OK. Not super hot and crispy. The pho was decent but nothin special id say.   The restaurant is big and can accommodate a party of at least 10 people with their big round tables. There can be a wait and you'll need to put your name on the sign in sheet.   Plan a trip to pho Kim long. You won't regret it ;-)",

Almost hard to choose between the two. 24 hours so it's a great way to end a long night. Spring rolls are also good. They have smoothies and Thai ice tea with boba as an option. The combination pho comes large by default, and it is a very generous portion! The small of definitely enough to fill you up if you choose the other options. Combination does not include beef balls unfortunately. VERY generous with beef.  Plenty of flavor in the broth. Just all around great pho.",

When they served the food all together, it was cold and the plate of shrimps was mixed with raw chicken which is very unacceptable and disgusting. We called the waiter to cancel or the orders and we ended up paying the beverages.  No one of them at least saying sorry about what happened.",

There are some off times when the soup tastes too watery or is off in some other way, but that's a rare occasion.   I always always always order the pho and egg rolls. The broth is sooo on point and perfect for any type of upset stomach, and the egg rolls are pretty good too.   Their menu has gotten significantly bigger over the years- I should probably venture out and try other items haha this restaurant can get pretttyy darn busy sometimes and the parking lot isn't the greatest :( BUT! The wait is never too horrible and I feel the pho is worth it :)",

This place is always packed from people that came from the strip trying to get their pho fix after a night of drinks and dancing. Although, it's always packed and the lines are long, the lines pretty go fast. People just come and eat and then leave. Service is pretty fast too without compromising the quality of food.

Tips depend on the customer service. Sometimes we don't tip a lot or at all because we felt they only came around once. Good luck trying to get a refill - you'll have to wave them down and if they stop, they'll make it seem like such a hassle to wait on you. And I've worked as waitress - I understand! There's a difference between being really busy so you're unfortunately unable to stop by tables often AND just not coming by or checking on you at all.   They never used to push the tip on customers and we freely gave tips with every meal. When my mother asked if they were serious about the tip requirement, the cashier then announced out loud to our waiter across the room and in front of the whole restaurant, \"Table 15, NO TIP!\"   It was so uncalled for. It's a shame because their food is pretty good, but it absolutely rubbed us so wrong that they force you to tip and if you don't, they announce it. It was just plain rude. Didn't expect them to treat longstanding customers that way. We have not gone back and are not going back!",

I also ordered spring rolls. My bill!!! Wicked cheap!! I'm going to stop here because I will return in 2017!!! So Too be continued  July 9th 2017 (I'm BACK AGAIN)  This year I brought my husband, the wait was about 15mins-30mins. After being seated we immediately knew what to order. **Side note** the staff moves quick here! You food will arrive in no time. It's no surprise we both ordered the #23. Vermicelli w/ Grilled Pork---however my husband decided to replace the noodles with rice (who does that) Anywho, everything was perfection!! This is the best place in China town!

Relatively speaking, for the food alone this would merit three very solid A-OK stars.  But...  Open 24 hours. REALLY fast, efficient service. Clean (for the most part, if not a bit outdated). I got the bun bo hue, bro got the rare steak pho, we split an order of spring rolls. The rolls came out last btw (lol). Peanut sauce was to DIE for, but the rolls themselves were meh.  I loved my beef soup, bro loved his broth too. Standard accoutrement. I mean, the fact alone that this place is called what it is (hahaha), plus being chock full of young Asian patrons at 2am (we'd just cruised over from midnight Christmas mass, lol), they have to be doing something right.  Price was perfect. Again, it isn't Little Saigon pho but it's absolutely fantastic for a late Vegas winter holiday. Four super stars!!!  PS. Try your soup before you dump the ish into it... delicious!",

It's also convenient to meet up with friends here if they are here visiting and staying on the strip. This place does get pretty busy though so if you come with a large group, be prepared to wait.   The service here use to be horrible and the staff seemed like they didn't care about their customers and hated their jobs. However, I do see an improvement on their customer service now. Our server today provided good customer service and checked on our table a few times.",

It looks so gross, no crunch, pale  looking pieces of squid wrapped in soggy flour. \"Special\"fried rice is ok, rice plate with yellow colored pieces of chicken, so, so., $38+. Could have been in sushi place. Noticed the entrance floor mats look old and dirty, inside is dark and dingy. Menu list wrapped in plastic needs renewal, kind of sticky. Regrets, threw most of the food. Overall, place needs renovations. Not to give business next time we visit VEGAS. Bay Area Vietnamese restaurants are a lot better.",

Good thing I was Vietnamese and I can eat those things, but this is not a good pho place. The service was excellent and the interior was mediocre. The bathroom. Don't get me started.

Just an FYI, they do not offer pho with TENDON !  Since they didn't have my beloved tendon, I opted for a mix of both rare and cooked steak. The soup was super salty like borderline undrinkable, meat was meh, the only thing they got right was the noodles. Although the meal was mediocre at best, I just continued eating as a means of recovering from my crazy night in Vegas.   Final Verdict:  I know for a fact that there are better Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown, so peace out!",

The crowd waiting outside for lunch was a True life struggle when you are starving but the line moved pretty quick - probably waited for ~30 minutes for a party of 5 people on a Saturday. There was a Lee's Sandwichs a few doors down in the same plaza so we got some banh mi while we waited. Once we sat down at Pho Kim Long, we all ordered pho, some spring rolls, an eggplant dish, and a chinese veggie dish. The pho soup was good - not too sweet which is what I dislike about some places. It has a hearty beef flavor that was nice and clear. The noodles could have been a bit more al dente though but that's a personal preference. There was also an abundance of meat that I definitely could not finish, Everything was great and really hit the spot. Their salty limeade drink was also delicious. Service was average but they are super busy so I don't expect much. I would definitely come back again when in Vegas!",

    "text": "I admit, everytime I drove down Spring Mountain Rd. or passed the big billboard for Pho Kim Long, I would just bust out laughing. Just because of the name, I had to try this place out. Best thing is, I was hungry late at night and this joint is open 24 hours!  Upon entering, it's in a regular old strip mall. There's enough parking fronting the restaurant. I didn't have many high expectations of this place. The seating reminded me of a traditional Chinese restaurant with round tables, rather than a Vietnamese restaurant.  Service was ok, but not overly friendly. I got the shrimp banh xeo for the appetizer, which is a shrimp fried pancake with mint, lettuce and other conidments to wrap it in. Delicious, crispy but not too oily.  I ordered the pho tai nam. I love their broth. Very rich, piping hot and tasty. Noodles were cooked well and not too hard or soggy. Plenty of condiments from the sweet basil, beans sprouts, garlic chili oil sauce, etc.  I would say the best broths I've tasted ever. Beats any broth in Hawaii hands down.   I loved the food. Food came out fast. Service wasn't that friendly, but hey, if you are efficient and fast, I'm okay with that. Love that it's 24 hours and wished we had something like this in Hawaii.",

Although not the best pho of my life, definitely above average in my book.  I also ordered a grilled pork chop rice plate which was decent, I would say it was pretty average.

The pho is unbelievable as well as the chicken pad thai. If you're looking for good starters I recommend the egg rolls, spring rolls or pot stickers. The wonton soup is also a personal favorite from here. You get huge portions of delicious food made fresh no matter what time you come in. This place is always busy. I have been here at dinner time and 3am. Each time the place was full making for a fun atmosphere. Even though it's popular the service is fast. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was because when we came to place a takeout order the man taking our order was extremely rude and short with us. It was upsetting cause I love the food but had a really unfortunate experience with the staff. We were describing a pho to see if he could help us determine which one it might have been. He responded \" I don't know. I have no clue what you ordered last time\" in no way did he even attempt to help us. With that said the food is great and besides that one unfortunate incident the service has been decent. Definitely recommend no matter when that food craving may hit.",

Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.  Everything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.  To top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!",

Little Rock to Honolulu, LA to Vegas... Okinawa all the same. This Japanese wife of mine loves Pho.  So of course, off we go.....  I must say, it's hard for me to necessarily tell the difference between Pho (broth etc) but SOMETHING about this place just seemed slightly better. Now then that's not to say the others were subpar... Just this one is somehow ... BETTER.  My wife, whom is some kinda pho semi-pro-am taster expert, confirmed my suspicions by vocally stating over and over how GOOOOOD hers was.  I don't know the names. I had pho something with brisket. Large. Dumped sriracha in it and went to town. No veggies (onions etc) just meat and noodles and I Jammed out. No hassle from Waitstaff.  The wife got Pho Ga. Loved it. Large size. Put it like this... Of all the restaurants I review, she has never actually finished her meal, ever.... She slammed that large bowl, totaled it. That is a testament of how good/legit it was.  Vegas can get expensive... This place was refreshingly cheap and super delicious. About 3 min drive from circus circus. Parking is a B***h but whatever, circle around until you find one. It's worth it.  If you're visiting Vegas or a local... Get some Vietnamese in ya life... That Pho FoSho!",

After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.  Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.",

The greens are dirty and not washed enough - the basil looked dirty, the sprouts were wilted and old, some of the onion bits in my soup seemed dirty too (both green and white types).  Putting these in the broth (which was middling quality) made everything taste dirty.  The steak tasted old and was a bit rainbow-y (generally not a good sign).  The fact that this place ever got voted 'best Vietnamese' is probably a reflection of how many drunkards there are here.  You can do better, people, even in the middle of the night.  If it's daytime, you have no reason whatsoever to come here.  There is worlds better pho just in the nearby area, let alone citywide.",

I always order their #14 Rare Steak Noodle Soup, great broth, but I am Mexican so I add a lot of lime and a few squirts of sriracha sauce and some jalapeno slices. But I can't just order only pho. I as well order their crispy eggrolls and crab ragoons, both very delicious and worth looking like a pig in front of everybody.  They are always busy no matter what, especially weekend nights that u might not find parking in the entire shopping center, it has happened to me before.",

I tried to verify he was the owner and security would answer my question. I left there very sad because it's very uncalled for to treat anyone that way let alone someone that is contributing to your business. I will never come back here.",

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a place outside of the strip to eat at. It's a spacious venue and 24/7. There's no rush, but the food comes out quickly.  The fresh spring rolls were great and actually fresh. The pho here is rich in flavor - we got the combination platter. I also got Vietnamese Caramelized Pork (Thit kho to), which was flavorful and well done, but not really worth the $18. The mango smoothie seemed watered down, but was still a great dessert drink. The coconut drink was ok as well.  All in all, I would definitely go again though. The food and service were great for a cheap price and quick meal.",

I was getting my bracelet restrung at the World of Feng Shui during a trip to Vegas and got hungry.  I was by myself and thought, hmmm, let's get some Vietnamese since I'm right in the middle of Chinatown.....?  Long story short.  I waited for 15 minutes.  They forgot to bring my 3 color bean drink (the very first thing I ordered).  The pho was average.  I asked for just tendons in my pho.  I love tendons.  There might have been 3 pieces floating or buried under my noodles.  The eggrolls were greasy and very small.    Maybe I'm just used to Westminster, CA or Little Saigon as it's known as.  Or maybe I made the mistake of asking my Lebanese taxi driver where to get good Vietnamese.  Or maybe I just should have stuck with Chinese food in Chinatown......",

Til today they still do and it's been one of my most favorite restaurants to go to nearly 2 decades now.  But their customer service has gone down hill bad.  A few of the staff are still great however in the last couple of times that I came with my friends to eat there they get aggressive when it comes to getting their tips. I work at a tip job so I give higher than normal tips when I get good service because I know how it's like. But I don't take out my tip until after I pay the bill. While paying my bill the cashier told me to put a tip down on the receipt. I said we will pay cash.  The cashier angrily told me that there is nothing on the table. Tips are earned,  not something you demand.  To the jackass behind the register,  you need to be fired for your actions. Almost 20 years i've eaten here and introduced many of my friends to this place.  Now,  I no longer want to go back.  Terrible customer service.  Earn your tips,  don't demand people to pay them unless they are a big party. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "BEST PHO IN VEGAS.  I'm Vietnamese so growing up I've had A LOT of pho (but it's True nothing beats Mom's :P) and this place is just so damn delicious. The broth is really sweet and flavorful but not in that dump buckets of MSG into the broth way. The meat (I always get the brisket) is so soft, so so soft and tender. The veggies are always fresh and even the broken rice plates (com bo nuong) are amazing! A lot of rice plates are meh with the rice being too hard or God forbid too soggy, but the rice here is always perfect. They even include a small bowl of soup broth to compliment the dish-a must. I've been here a few times and despite all the amazing buffets/restaurants that Vegas has to offer, I need (NEED) to come here at least once. It's that good.  BUT and here's a reason why this place didn't get a 5 star review (trust me it hurts me too) the service is whack. I KNOW I KNOW, this is an Asian restaurant and they aren't known for their amazing service. Anyone growing up in an Asian community knows that (Asian restaurants ARE good for cheap prices, large portions, and amazing daily specials though) but I hate knowing that if I come here I would have to wait at least an hour. Because it's so delicious though the wait is something that just comes with the territory so I try not to get too stuck on it. BUT it's not so much the wait that bothers me, but the fact that I have to keep tab on the servers to make sure they don't skip us. I've realized that despite writing our names down, sometimes the server would skip our party (happened more than once) and we would have to wait even longer because of their mistakes. We would have to remind them and they would be like \"Oh sorry, looks like someone crossed it out, I didn't know\" and it happened more than once. Other people would come in complaining about the wait, and they would look on the clipboard and make some excuse about not seeing the name.   ALSO we went with a party of 6 and a party of 7 that went in after us got the table? Why? When my mom asked the lady just gave her some vague answer about another table getting up with 6 people, but they probably just wanted to seat the bigger table to get more money. I mean, I sure hope that extra one person made a difference in the budget. *rant over*  So if the service was just a little better (and less \"forgetful\") this place would definitely earn 5 stars. It's spacious and clean, and overall a must if you are ever in Vegas and are craving some bomb ass pho BUT you have been warned about the service.",

From the decor to the menu to the crowd, etc. It's great to see how successful this place has become, but the high volume does make it difficult to have any type of traditional service experience. And by that, I mean you definitely feel like a number. It's great that the food is delivered so fast, but I feel like I'm being pushed out the door right after I have been seated. The food is good and the pho broths are flavorful, and they expanded their menu throughout the year. But with so many homestyle pho restaurants around the valley, I've found other places to go. What's great though is that it's 24 hours so when i do have that late night craving for Vietnamese food and my usual place is closed, I know just where to go.",

They're really funny and laid back, which is really refreshing from your typical server.  Now on to the food. I get the vegan pho with only broccoli and carrots and I add tofu. It is SOOO good. I've also had the pad thai and veggie nuggets with rice before. When I first thought of vegan pho, I didn't expect much flavor, but it was jam packed with it and has become my favorite dish to get. The veggie nuggets are outstanding. It used to be my favorite before I tried the pho. They aren't your typical fake chicken flavor and texture. I'm not sure what it is made with, but I can see some veggies haha. They have this unique, but good, taste and something I still order often. I've also had their strawberry smoothie and thai tea with boba. Their thai tea is pretty standard, and their strawberry smoothie was very creamy. I personally like to get both drinks with light boba. Overall, their food does not disappoint. If you are vegan or vegetarian, this place is GREAT for you! And of course, if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian, this place is still great!",

We hail from the Midwest so we've had our fair share of pho and other Asian goods from Chicago to Minneapolis.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated. There were 7 of us. Food came in super fast. The egg rolls were delightful. It came with a side of lettuce and shredded, sweet and sour pickled carrot and daikon.   The pho portions are good portion sized. I just wish there were more noodles. I would have to say it's the best pho I've ever had!!! A squeeze of sriracha and a tad of hoisin sauce was all it took. My sister, the nit picky unofficial pho connoisseur, was very fond of the broth as well. The meatballs looked homemade, not like the rubbery kind you buy frozen from Asian super markets.  I took a star off for the service. They want you in and out. This place is also open 24-hours! So good, I even dreamt about going back. I only have my pictures to relive it.",

My parents told me they had a great pho at this place, which is the reason why I decided to come here while on vacation in Las Vegas.   I had a combination pho and I was so impressed that I came back the next day. I shared shrimp pho, lettuce wrap, mapo tofu and seafood crispy noodle with my family and everything was sooooo delicious. I think the food was excellent because the ingredients were high quality and super fresh. I had pho in 5 different states and I would say this place made the best pho ever.   Mapo tofu was not as spicy as I wanted it to be so it was my least favorite but I can see how people who can't handle my spicy level will appreciate this place's version of mapo tofu. When I come back to LV, I'm definitely coming back here.",

I said what......?????   I got to the restaurant and showed him my bill from couple nights prior and he literally laughed and said \"that's not my problem here is our menu\" and showed me the price in the restaurant and that adding fried rice for $2.50 LIKE YOU CAN ON POSTMATES is not an option in the restaurant.   I said I'd like to speak to a manager and he literally laughed again and said not my problem....I get it the language barrier was clearly an issue but he also knew exactly what I was saying and showing him.   Not worth dealing with inconsiderate assholes for some average orange chicken and $12 side of fried rice. Of course I messaged the business owner the next day and never got a response. Who cares, right? Not them.",

I put the card in the bill holder and the waitress took it to the front, and after twenty minutes it still hadnt been returned, prompting me to ask at the register for it back. The manager at the register didn't have it, had no idea where it was and looking at my banking app showed the card had been charged for a totally different order and several other charges after the restaurant, indicating the card had been stolen. Again the food is great and was comped for the trouble but I'm just not sure how somewhere can allow someone to steal a customers debit card right from the register and only say \"oh well, that sucks\". It really makes me wonder what other issues the place might have.",

    "text": "There are a few restaurants in town that I have gone to for over 10 years and Pho Kim Long is one of them.  First of all, let's talk about the name. Yes, it does sound like something out of an R-rated movie...that's that, and now about the food.  PKL was the first restaurant that I ever tried Pho at--clear broth noodle soup with choice of protein, and lots of fresh herbs and vegetables. My favorite is the seafood pho. It always comes with a good amount of sliced calamari, shrimp, and some imitation Crab meat. I add some chili oil and sliced raw onion, along with the plate full of vegetables. And just like that, it has become my favorite hangover food. While eating seafood pho, I often order Charbroiled Chicken & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli to go for my lunch at work. The way they pack it keeps all the ingredients fresh and easy to mix when I am ready to enjoy it.  They are open 24 hours a day, so if you are dancing or clubbing all night, this is the perfect spot to hit on the way home, or fill up on some yummy food the morning after to kill your hangover. You certainly don't need a hangover to enjoy Pho Kim Long though...you can always come in just because, and have a nice bowl of soup for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Their menu is lengthy, so if you like something else, come with friends and share.  - 2017 Review #39 -",

I asked our waitress if she knew of any good Asian places,without hesitation she immediately wrote down Pho Kim Long on a napkin and gave it to us.  Since we had tickets for a show that was ending at 11pm we decided to give this place a try as they are open 24/7.   Both my friends had never tried Vietnamese food so I was a little skeptical, not knowing how they would react and whether they would like it. Forget like, they simply loved it!!  Great place, good service and reasonable pricing. I strongly recommend this place but be prepared for a rather long wait. If you want to avoid the wait go after midnight. Give this place a try, trust me you won't be disappointed.",

The server and food runner were friendly but the other staff members weren't as much.  The goi cuon was dry and loosely wrapped... The nuoc mam lacked in flavors... the cha gio was average...  What I did enjoy was the bun thit nuong! Grilled porked was sweet yet savory. The bowl contains a good amount of lettuce to balance out the rice noodles. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Another missed opportunity was the boba slush. They use powder for almost every flavor so I'm not a big fan of that.  Overall the spot doesn't strike me as a staple location to recommend or go out of my way to eat at. Better service could have changed that if they had anticipated the guest's needs and concerns more.",

I used to claim this was one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas, but no longer feel compelled to visit as I once did. Spring rolls were extremely dry as if they had been from the day before. They brought the bowls of pho without all of the accoutrements and had to ask several times just to get some sprouts and basil. Was not a busy day (Tuesday 2pm) but server was exceptionally rude. It's a shame because I couldn't wait to come here and now feel I need to find a new go-to Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.",

It's off the strip but nothing a taxi ride won't get you too. We ordered the mi (stir fry noodles), chao ga (Vietnamese Rice Porridge w/ chicken) and their pho (beef noodle soup of course). All pretty tasty for a bunch of girls that are hungry after a night of non-stop dancing. We devoured our bowls and plates without hesitating.   Love the convenience of it being opened 24/7 on top of the location which is away from the strip. Sometimes it's breath of fresh air to get off the strip. And that is why my friends, I give Pho Kim Long 5 stars.",

The spring rolls were fabulous. The pho was delicious. The service was meh.   The 3 color dessert was horrendous. You get a plastic cup, a mound of shaved ice on top that is impossible to eat with a plastic spoon because the ice hardens, and the green gelatin layer tastes like green hardened rice noodles. The coconut milk, instead of being liquid, freezes with the ice. Quite disappointing, really, to eat such a poorly prepared yet simple dessert.  3 stars. Pretty comfy and bright interior. Food is average and there are a lot of options.",

If you are new to the Vietnamese food world... stick to the basics and get a Pho Ga (Chicken Soup)... but if you're feeling a little adventurous... Pho Kim Long definitely has more... hence the name... LOL  I always, always get the claypot pork.  A perfect compliment to that is steamed rice and canh cua (hot n sour soup).  If you are in the mood for fish, they have a crispy friend fish that is really good.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu... so it's really about what you are craving that night... or morning (after the clubs)!!  Enjoy =)",

It's a little more expensive than what I'm used to paying (like around $5 or $6 for pho), but they make up for it in size.  My wife's vermicelli dish was just ok.  She had charbroiled chicken & egg rolls in there.  The chicken & egg rolls were missing flavor a little bit, but still good overall.  The service was actually decent.  We got seated right away, someone came  by to take our order relatively fast and they did an ok job with filling up our cups.  I would definitely come back.",

So in we go.  They saw us come in. Nothing. So we waited. Nothing. Waited some more. Eventually they asked us how many in our group. 5. So we were finally seated. My seat was sticky so I moved over one. Fine. We ordered our drinks and once they came we were asked if we were ready to order. We weren't and asked for a couple minutes. I guess by \"a couple minutes\" the waiter assumed we needed a few hours to decipher the menu because he didn't come back. We talked and waited and well,by the time the waiter DID come back 3 of us were more than halfway done with our drinks.   I was NOT pleased with the food or the service.  I went back another time deciding that maybe I just had a bad experience that first time,  Yes,the service sucked.",

And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is.   Second, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.  Overall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers.",

The quality, however, strangely varies.  I had Singapore Rice Noodles this week and it was kinda weak - not strongly seasoned or generous with anything but noodles and onions and kind of dry.  Last week, I ordered the same dish and it was delicious and kinda SPICY!  I was disappointed this week, to say the least.    The service is always flakey with no personality.  They get your food out pretty quickly but refills are slow moving, particulaly with water.  I start singing loudly when I have to wait more than five minutes and they show up pretty quickly after that.  After they drop your food off, they are gone for a good ten minutes.    That previous reviewer isn't kidding - this place is hopping ALL the time!  You sometimes may have to wait a few minutes to get seated... rarely because there's a line but because the servers are booking it all over the place  The food is NOT spicy enough for me, generally.  I have to tell them to make it super spicy since their scale for spiciness is a little off.  They're a great place, though, if you're looking for a decent, run-of-the-mill Pho restaurant that's reliable and 24/7.",

I haven't been here in years, and we defaulted and came here because the other place we wanted to have dinner was on an hour-and-a-half wait. We signed our names on the wait list, and got seated shortly after. But nobody came to our table for at least 15 minutes. I had to get up and have somebody come over to our table to take our order. We ordered tofu spring rolls which were trash. Literally just a little fried tofu and Shredded Lettuce inside the rice wrapper. They actually have a vegan pho on the menu and they should probably work on adding some FLAVOR to it because it was BLAND AF. It's nice when places offer vegan pho, with the Veg broth, but you can't just have some bland ass shit and put it on the menu likes it's a great idea. Because it ain't! Nobody is gonna go eat it if it SUCKS.",

    "text": "Did you have a soul-crushing, physically destructive night of partying last night? Well come on in to Pho Kim Long where you can get a nice, steamy bowl of pho so you can sweat out the regretful decisions you made!  More often than not as I depart from Vegas, my friends and I will always find our way to Pho Kim Long for a bowl of pho for lunch. And the fact that the restaurant is usually packed and there's a bit of a wait during peak hours is a testament that everyone is thinking the same thing. At an incredibly reasonable price, especially considering that it's Vegas we're talking about, you can get a solid and filling bowl of life-granting noodle soup.  No matter which pho place I go to, I always get the pho tai chin which is the noodle soup with sliced rare tenderloin alongside well-done flank/brisket. Also pro tip as someone who loves meat on the rare/medium-rare side is that I always ask for the tai meat (the rare tenderloin part I mentioned) on the side. Because when you order the tenderloin meat, it's already placed into the soup for you by default. Thus by the time your steaming hot bowl gets to your table, the meat has been poached almost all the way through. By getting it separate, you have more control of how rare you want it by dunking it in at your own leisure.  The soup itself is clear yet packs strong beef broth notes. It's been skimmed of all the fats and simmering spices but you still get the sumptuous meat flavor throughout the broth that compliments the rice noodles, slices of various beef cuts, and the array of bean sprouts and herbs in your bowl.   Even better that this place is open 24/7 because no matter what bad decision you made, you can always follow it up with a good one by dropping by. This has been my comfort food all my life and as I take each bite at Pho Kim Long, I can feel my spirit revitalize from the void. It's like this miraculous bowl is telling me that everything is going to be ok and that my hangover will be gone soon~",

My husband and I come here at least 3 times a week just because it's sooooo damn good. I absolutely love their Thai tea, everywhere else legit tastes like spoiled milk    If you're looking for a good spot for Pho this is definitely the place to check out !   The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because when I order my Pho I like to get extra lime since they only offer 3-4 pieces on a small bowl (even if there's orders for 2-3 Phos) and I always seem to have to ask about 3 times before they actually bring the extra lime to the table and honestly it's annoying having to ask over and over again.",

I also tried a coworker's grilled pork from her bun, no-no, the chicken is so much better. She agreed after I gave her a piece of my chicken. Next time!

It's never really slow here... honestly, the slowest I've seen it is between 5-6 am. We have had to wait at 4:00am but it is always worth it. The crowd is usually industry workers and people leaving the club around that time.   There menu is extensive and easy to navigate. I always order the spring rolls with no tofu and the vegan pho extra vegetables/ light noodles. They load the veggies in and it's amazing. The broth is delicious and full of flavor. All the sauces are on the table when you sit down. The price is extremely fair and the service is usually pretty quick and accurate. My boyfriend usually gets the rare steak (extra steak x3) and he loves it. They don't skimp on the extras when ordered properly. I definitely recommend this place for dinner or a late night bite!",

However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native's mind is \"My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now.\" Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a \"Pho Kim Long\" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place!   The restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no \"larges\" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.  Definitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.  Side tip: Taxi ride from Cosmopolitan hotel to Chinatown where this place is located is about ~$13.00 (one trip)",

We arrived at Pho Kim Long and placed our name on their list for 17 people at 9:30 AM. There was hardly anyone waiting except us. When other people arrived after us, they let them in one by one.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, the host lady came outside and asked me what my name was. I told her we were in the same group that already signed up. I continued to tell her that we could be broken up to different tables if needed.  She just simply and totally ignored me and called out the other family that just arrived.  I thought to myself this was just a typical rude, unfriendly Asian customer service that I must accepted. By the way, I'm also an Asian.  It's about 10 AM now and we were still not called in.  Her list showed she already called in 5 other families that arrived after us.  My patience was running thin at this time.  I went in but she was busy at one of the tables.  I approached this little young Asian cashier guy whom I believe was the manager/owner.  I informed him nicely what happened.  He told me they were busy, therefore, I should continue to wait.  I told him we had been waiting for almost half an hour now and five families that arrived after us were already called in.  His next answer was shocking.  He said, \" the door is open, go somewhere else.\"  I was pissed.  I called him an idiot. After, he was in my face and I dared him to touch me.  Luckily, he didn't or he would be waking up in the hospital that day. By now, it's already 10 AM, we simply left and went to Pho Kinh Do, the restaurant we went earlier. We had a wonderful time there, the service was excellent and the food was great. 5 star rating there.",

    "text": "My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50).   Here came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \"special\" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special.   At this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...  I don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!",

    "text": "Pho Kim Long. Pho Kim Long. Pho Kim Long.  Yes, it's no mystery; I love the name. I also love the hours and the quality pho served during those available hours of operation.  My Yelp star rating: 4 stars  My reasonings for giving Pho Kim Long 4 (Yelp) stars, instead of the 3 I would have given, is for the sheer convenience and availability of some great-tasting pho. This is definitely not the best bowl of pho I've ever encountered, but it sure is good to be able to have \"good\" pho when I want it and need it most (at 4, 5, or 6am). Take-out pho from Pho Kim Long is my favorite after-Vegas-club remedy. And even though almost anything and everything tastes good when you're drunk, Pho Kim Long is good even while sober and/or hungover!  The broth is flavorful, but thankfully without that overwhelming, aromatic star anise taste. And it isn't too sweet, either. I like the rare beef/steak pho, and the meat tastes pretty fresh. And perfectly reddish-pink in the middle.  There is no question as to where I will be having pho when I'm in Vegas!  You can Pho Kim Long all day and all night!!!!!!  Yelp 365 - #289/365",

Now that we got that out of the way, one of my friends (who is a Vegas regular) recommended this place after a long night of eating, drinking, debating about politics, thinking about going clubbing, not going clubbing, getting old, and then getting hungry again!  I was excited, not becuase of the name, but because this place was supposed to have some really good PHO!  Sad to say, I was very disappointed!  The pho looked good, but didn't measure up to its good looks.  My pho had rare beef and beef balls, both of which were dry and flavorless.  I added my normal squeeze of lime and tons of sriracha but the broth was just not doing it for me.  I took a few sips/bites and I was done!  Finished up my beer and left quite unsatisfied.  Maybe it was just an off night or maybe because it was 3 in the morning?!!",

I love the chicken wings, Spicy pork, There is so much that is good but my over all favorite I get just about every time we go is the Pho Thai Soup. My friend told me to try it since I never had it before and it is the BOMB!!! So good. The broth is great, everything inside is so good together. Add some of the sauces they have on the table, add a little extra hot sauce just not the fish one that smells nasty! I always get my steak on the side it is rare and I can add it in and it  cooks fast inside the soup.  The bowl is big and I always end up taking some home for lunch the next day. Prices are not bad here. If you like Vietnamese or Chinese food try this place out. Has a great reputation. Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are. You can ask just about anyone walking by who works there and they will help you out.  It is nice they are open all night for that late night snack or dinner. We recommend this place totally!!!",

The pho broth itself was a little more cloudy than I am used to seeing, but it tasted okay. Wasn't horrible and wasn't the best pho I've ever had. The prices are comparable to what I'm used to paying. The service was okay, prompt but nothing to brag about. Overall, I think I would only come back if I wanted to go play ping pong again next door and this place just happens to be near it.",

If you can get yourself out of bed and actually manage to stomach more substance into your body, this is place to go to cure whatever you got.

Don't expect the same quality nor quantity as you do in California. It's going to be more expensive and as of late they really started skimping out on the portions.

The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the spring rolls which are something my girlfriend and I almost always get with our pho, hence the 4/5.  Customer service: 5/5 It's good for any sort of asian food place. The people were courteous, kept my water filled without me asking, and delivered the bill promptly/returned the receipts.  Ambiance: 4/5 The place is in the heart of asian town on Spring Mountain Rd. It's nice inside and smells strongly of pho (which is why you're going here, right??). The one thing I disliked was the fish tank looked quite unkempt while I was there, but that could have been something they were in the process of cleaning or something... Still, minus one star.",

I had once thought this was a great place, but that's till I actually tried out other authentic Vietnamese places right near this very one. On top of that I was stiffed on my egg roll order, and the manager neglected to correct their error saying that my party and I had already eaten the order. When this happened we decided that the service and respect that we were receiving were much less than desirable, and opted to no longer have our meals there. (Please take into account that all we had received in our egg roll order was 1, when the order should actually come with a total of 4). Of course since we all had not had anything to eat, we felt there should be nothing that we have to pay for and decided to walk out. Oh... was that a big mistake!!!! as we casually walked out to my car I was tackled by one of the employees, Literally to the ground and held there till the police arrived. This was truly a traumatic experience for me. I will never come back to this place again, and recommend you save yourself the time, and money as well.",

My first time here was w/ Susan R. and it was sort of an unsavory experience, not because of the company or the food, but because a certain a-hole that we both had the displeasure of knowing was the main topic of conversation, anyways, that's neither here nor there...  The Pho is great! My friend ordered the Orange Chicken and the Scallops with Black Bean Sauce.  I love the fresh ingredients in Vietnamese cooking, it really adds a distinct taste that sets it apart from Chinese food.  If you're gonna do Vietnamese, go to Pho Kim Long, I highly recommend it!",

The hai nan chicken had no flavor at all.   The shredded pork in the combo plate came out cold.  It wasn't great but it wasn't awful either...  so hence the 3 star rating.",

We had a group of 16 and were told it would be a half hour wait. Since it was over 100 degrees outside, our friends decided to go to the boba place right by since there wasn't any room in the restaurant to wait. When the lady asked who had a table of 16, we said that was us. She asked where everyone was and we let her know they were on the way. She then said she could not seat us if everyone wasn't there. We again said they were almost there and she told us she was going to give up our table. Luckily our friends ran in right then and there. They still missed a seat so our friend had to stand around for a couple of minutes. The pho was disgusting. It was so salty that no one at our table finished our bowls and I was only able to take two bites. One of my friends had to pour his water into the pho. Worst dining experience of my life. I would never recommend this place to anyone.",

It's no wonder why its the current hot spot for people to grab a late night bowl of sweet broth and tasty beef noodles. I would say, unless its packed up to the brink, this would be your go to for Pho in the town. It's not very far from the strip either and the prices are really good compared to your forty dollar buffets in the Casinos. They have a bunch of other stuff besides Pho too so if you're craving Asian/Viet this is your place. The Pho Ga (Chicken Noodles) weren't that great but that's my two cents.",

It's always been one of my favorite places for pho and I hope that never changes. The egg rolls are crisp and flavorful. And even though tofu nuggets sound weird, they're super yummy, too.

It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.  I was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, tendon, rare beef and brisket. The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it.   This is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen. Do people have parties here like they do at Chinese restaurants? Let's have a pho-king party! Being 24/7 definitely is also a plus and I'll have to keep this place in mind for late night or early morning outings.",

Open all night long ... Always crowded, prepare to wait for the table.  It is completely different atmosphere in a daytime than the night time. Most likely very loud crowd at late night!   We were eating here forever, breakfast, lunch, dinner, everything between. Food is tasty and affordable. We love Pho, so we eat it often. Tried almost all from the menu. Our other favorite menu items  are: Sweet and sour pork; Seafood clay pot; Oysters in black bean sauce; House special fried rice, and many other things. Pretty much we like everything ...  Service is fast and average. We are going to keep coming back!",

I ordered fried rice and Vegan Pho , to my disbelief the rice wasn't fried and my Pho was lukewarm, so I waved the server down and asked him to have the rice re-fried, the fried rice I received afterwards was bathed in oil and mushy.  I asked one of the random servers to take it back after waiting over five minutes for someone to come check and see if I was satisfied.  I asked for a freshly prepared rice dish and again  I got mushy fried rice!   I stood up and walked to the cashier, the cashier is the manager, well this m*t*h*e*r%^&*#$, told me how this is how  traditional fried rice is made, and that this is the way they make the rice, and that he wasn't my servant, a comment he made after I told him how the customer is always right .  I proceeded to tell him how it wasn't traditional fried rice and that I wasn't  going to eat it or pay for something that I haven't eaten, he refused to give me my money back and told me to dispute it with my bank.  I came back to my table and the security guard asked me to step outside, I was embarrassed, cold, and my girl was left hungry.   I was treated like a drunk fool, and I wasn't even drunk.  The security guard tried to mediate the situation having me and my girl wait outside in the cold while he would go inside and talk to Ken the manager.  Well, the guard told me that Ken didn't want to deal with the situation anymore and that he was just going to make the fried rice (to go) one more time and that he was done bartering with me.   p.s.  food is overpriced and their quality doesn't match, spend your money elsewhere.",

I've made an attempt to come here at around noon and the place was packed which i totally understand but i wasn't trying to wait around too long to get my bowl so i went to the one around the corner, OVERALL i liked it and would patronize here again.",

I strongly recommend the fried chicken wings because it's so bomb! They even have the ones marinated in fish sauce (nuoc mam) which had TONS of flavors. The fried calimari was also good being crunchy and topped with flavored seasonings. The Pho here is perfect after a long night of drinking to sober you out. I had the beef and meatballs (Pho Tai Bo Vien) twice and it was delicious both times. My friends had the chicken and complain it was too dry..  Service was great, food came out quick and the decor had a modern Asian feeling to it. Great place and I will surely come here again in my next Vegas trip.",

I hope they fix a few staff problems because this used to be one of my favorite places to eat pho. Now? Not so much. Almost too popular which is why they seem to be losing their professionalism.

The pho is by no means the best nor the worst, it just hit the spot in filling our stomachs, nothing really stood out from this pho. I ordered the special (I forgot what it was called, but it had everything that was suppose to come in the pho). The bowl size on the special is the largest so the waiter won't ask which size you want. Price is whatever, some people say its high compared to other places in Vegas, I haven't been to any other, so basing it off from the prices in California, about a tad above average I guess. The service wasn't bad, our drinks got refilled when we asked, we got our neccesary things.",

The place usually busy, but they try to get people in & out real A.S.A.P. The wait time us reasonable, even on busy hours. The food is great, from pho to seafood to rice plates. The prices are somewhat reasonably to somewhat pricy, but I can tell that is worth it. The servers are ok and ambiance is alright.  You should definitely try this place without hesitation!",

After 30+ minutes standing waited for table then we waited for another 15 minutes for waiter, and then another 20 minutes to get pho on our table. Pho is OK, not as good as other said and reviewed. Pho supposed to be hot and smelled good (and real hot too) but this pho is so warm or even it was not \"warm\" enough in every bows. The service was below average; a man who was a waiter seem to be not speak well English and also seem to be not very polite during servicing/taking orders from customers.",

We were sat pretty quickly which was nice, happy that they have such a quick turnover for tables.  The food is consistently good every time I come here.  Today the dish I usually order (pork chop w/ baked egg) was extra delicious!  They had a special salt & pepper eggplant that was pretty good as well.  The only reason I took away a star was because they forgot my drink order and when I asked for utensils they also forgot to bring some by.  They didn't check on us after all the food was dropped off and we had to go to the counter to get our check.  But all in all, still a great late night place to get your Asian food fix after a night out of clubbing or work!",

With my most recent trip to Vegas being a bit longer of a stay.... finally, I had enough time to make it out to this 24/7 pho joint. I'm glad I did!!  First off, the Crab Rangoon was so good that I ordered a second order... (don't worry, I was sharing haha). So definitely try that!   For my main dish, I ordered the beef and flank pho... sooooo delicious! I think I'm getting the hang of how to eat pho! I'm still quite the novice pho eater, so I don't have a bunch to compare to... but the pho I had in Hawaii was on par with this establishment.  To be honest, this place was a lot bigger than I imagined and a lot nicer, too. For a place thats open 24hrs a day, I figured it'd be a little hole in the wall... but there is ample seating and the ambience is surprisingly a slight step above casual. (Though you can stroll in here casual, dont worry).",

    "text": "Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous.   Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called \"chicken\" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply \"pork\".   Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back.   NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation.   This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:  Manager: \"you didn't pay enough!\" Me: \"no, we paid for what we ate.\" Manager: \"shut up!\"  So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!).   This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to \"go to hell\".   Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!       This doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying I love Pho Kim Long! So you're probably thinking \"well, your two star rating doesn't really indicate that\". It doesn't. I love the pho and the food in general. It's great! I've had pho at a few other places and it's just not the same. I also love that this place is open like 24 hours (maybe they close at some point, but I'm pretty sure I've ended up here past two a.m) The chicken pad thai is pretty freaking bad ass too!   So the reason for my two star rating is because I've had pretty crappy customer service at this place. I like to rate food establishments based on a few standards....quality of food, cleanliness, and customer service! Quality of food gets an A+, however, the other two categories fail miserably. I've been here plenty of times, which gives this place a lot of chances to improve their customer service, and they just don't!   One time we had to wait forever (which you can usually expect if you're going on the weekend or anytime during the dinner rush) and our waiter was just generally unpleasant. Nothing specific, just a bad attitude. The most recent visit, the waitress brought over our water and said she'd give us a few minutes, which happened to be maybe twenty minutes (I'm indecisive, but I don't need twenty whole minutes to choose my dinner). The water had a very tiny bug in it, which I really didn't think was a huge deal. I don't get grossed out easily so I just asked for another one. What really kind of got me thinking was how calm and casually the waiter reacted to it. He just nonchalantly said \"Oh, sorry. I'll bring you another one\" and quietly walked away with my bug infested water. Not the worst part. While still enjoying my pho and chatting with my girlfriend I was asked TWICE if I was finished with my food and almost got my plate taken away if I didn't respond fast enough! That was the deal breaker for me. I like to take my time when I eat, especially if I'm having good company and good conversation. So that really irked me. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. I wasn't asked if I wanted a box for my leftover food (didn't really want one, but I feel like servers should always ask, specially if there's a lot of food left on the plate). There's been other occasions in which they just refuse to accommodate a simple request or just show absolutely no enthusiasm. Lame!  So, in conclusion, if you want good pho and shitty customer service. This is the spot!",

I usually don't get the sauce on the side like that and it made the soup really flavorful. It was a good size portion too and it has to be one of the best ones I've eaten. Although it may not be the cheapest but it was worth the money. My bf ordered the Singapore noodles and he really liked it! You can definitely taste and smell the curry spices in the noodles.

    "text": "4 stars for being open 24 hours and having a sweet name....  2 stars for eh food.  I was pretty sobered up by the time we got here, maybe it's ah-mazing when you're drunk?  My bun with bbq chicken and spring rolls was ok.  Mike C. didn't like his roasted chicken with rice at all, said it was super dry.  The pho was eh, not the best.  The porridge was tasteless, had to add hoison and fish sauce to it just for the sake of adding some flavor. They did have a pretty decent variety on their menu from what I remember and our dishes came out pretty quick.  1 star for my friend having to wait forever for his fried rice.  Everyone got their dishes before he did.  Fried rice?  That should be the first thing out, I was about to go to the kitchen and whip some up myself.  1 star for bad service.  The servers gave looks like they hate their life and lagged on getting our check and filling our waters.  Sure it's 3am and they probably don't want to be there let alone put up with a bunch of drunk Asians, especially some of the ghetto fabulous ones I saw there.  But sorry, you're in customer service so please try to fake it for us at least.  1 star for being stranded here because our crazy ride ditched us and we had to walk along the street to flag down a taxi to take us back to the strip.  This place is not walking distance from the strip but only 10 minutes away by car.  Ok this isn't Pho Kim's fault, but just thought I\"d add it in anyways haha  I'd only come here again if I had a ride locked down and super drunk so I couldn't taste anything or care about service.",

My husband and his friends stopped here (at my recommendation and others) for lunch and enjoyed delishly prepared and priced food. The group walked out the door when my husband realized he left his phone on the table.  He turned back around (maybe 1 minutes time passed) went to the table where it was being cleaned and asked the waiter did someone see my phone it was right there. To which the guy replied \"no\" and kept \"working\"  Annoyed and confused the group returned to the hotel by cab. I decided to whip out my phone and locate his.  Low and behold we look at the iphone locator only to find that the iphone (30 min later) was in a car in the employee parking lot behind the restuarant. We were mid-tanning so we figured we'd head over there in the next hour. An hour later it was still thre so they try and hail a cab and locate the phone only to see it moving- in the car that the EMPLOYEE---  Eat at your own risk- keep your phones hidden these employees have no common courtesy.",

    "text": "Our server barrel spoke English, which made ordering and asking about menu items difficult. We asked about the clay pot dishes, and all he could tell us was that it took 30 minutes to make and that we wouldn't like it. Jason HATES when people.. ahem me.. tell him he won't like it, and he would have ordered it but was too hungry to wait.  Calamari: DELICIOUS! Definitely the highlight of the meal- garlic covered fried calamari. YUM! Seafood Sizzler Platter: BLAND!!! This was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, and I was so disappointed by how bland it was. There was more calamari than anything else (a bummer after we split a huge appetizer of calamari). I didn't finish the plate, and didn't bother taking it home. That says a lot.  Pork-Bowl Thing (Jason ordered it by photo): The pork was really good, but the rest of the bowl lacked creativity. He wasn't a fan of how much salad was in the bowl, and the sauce was bland.   Upon leaving, I asked the server if they accepted AmEx, he told me yes so I left my card with Jason before I went to the restroom. When I came back, I was told that they don't accept American Express, just \"regular cards\". Huh? Again, language barrier. Frustrating.  PROS: Calamari was good  CONS: Language barrier Service unhelpful No checkup on how food was Bland food  All in all, I definitely won't be back",

I can eat pho anytime...and pretty much everyday. I love pho & I love it even more when Im not sober. THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I KNOW whether its a guud pho place. Going intoxicated to a restaurant is similar to wearing beer goggles when checking out chicks. They all look/taste that much better. Coming to Pho Kim Long...yah i was intoxicated...so I should love the food even more right? For me, it was a No. I was satisfied (but not too satisfied), it was just A-OK, and I was starving like a hungry hippo.  Service was great though, but the food was just A-OK for me.

Anyway, I've been going here since I hit 21 with my friends. The prices are so reasonable and their food is absolutely amazing and hits the point everytime. One of my friend who was craving for it this past weekend when we were in Vegas, woke up from her nap and seriously drove there just to pick up the togo order, with a two hour time frame to get ready before going to Marquee. That is how good it is! Haha and she's not even Asian! Pho does the body good. I always get Pho Tai Chin, which is well done steak and rare steak. Their Roasted Chicken plate with seasonal rice is bombdotcom!   I'm Vietnamese and I know how pho should taste like. Go here if you crave for some pho while your visit in Vegas! I promise you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "This is one of my most favorite places here in Las Vegas. At any given time, this place is always packed - we even had a 20-min wait one time at close to 11pm!  But we endure the wait, which turned out to be not as long as we anticipated.  My favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here.  I also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy!  On our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well.  The fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was sauteed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home.  As for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, I take away a star bec of their service. The staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy. Lousy service won't keep me from coming back to this place though - I would just ignore it and look at my bowl of soup and it completely makes up for it.",

For the most part, they get you your food and then leave you alone until you're ready to pay. They charged a 15% gratuity on a party of 7. I don't know many Vietnamese restaurants that charges gratuity. For the service that we received the last time we went there (in early July), the gratuity was undeserving.  If you have a hankering for Vietnamese food, this place will give you what you want. They have good selections.  If you're just hungry for anything, I'd say skip it.",

The wait staff were friendly and patient so that's always a plus.  The facility was CLEAN!!  Now, that's something you don't see very often in pho joints. I also ordered the che ba mau (three-color dessert) and it was just okay.  It was in a small cup and I was charged $3.50.  Kinda pricey, but, meh, I've had better.  I took my parents here (who grew up in Vietnam and are self-proclaimed pho connoisseurs) and they really liked the food.  Score!  I pat myself in the back. The only downside was that it's a little pricier (by $1 or $2) than what my family and I were used to paying compared to pho in LA .  A couple dollars may not seem as much, but it'll add up.

The broth and noodles were delicious.  I am Vietnamese and there is always home cooked Pho at my house so I would know if it's good or not.  This place is not bad at all.  The service wasn't that great because the wait for the food was so long.  The prices for food here is average.  It's the perfect place to come after a long fun night out TRUST ME!  =)",

It is open 24 hours and the service is great.",

We were searching on Yelp for a few places, but our valet guy told us to head to Pho Kim Long since it's open 24 hours.  The place was super packed at 2:30AM!  Not even just young club go-ers, but families of people were all enjoying the pho.  We ordered 2 rare steak phos and an order of the fried calamari appetizer.  My bestie mixed the fish and the chili sauce together to make a yummy dipping sauce for the calamari.  Apparently there was a lot of Star anise in the broth that made it a little sweeter than normal.  Otherwise, the pho was yummy and perfect for what we needed that night.  Service was a tad bit slow, but like I said, the restaurant was packed so it's okay.",

A plus. But when it comes to food quality? I will never put this on top of my list. Ordered fried egg rolls, chicken fried rice and a large meatballs noodle soup. I'm sorry non of them tasted as least reach standard point to me. Thick skin egg rolls, plain fried rice which much needed of flavoring. I do believe the fried rice they served was not freshly stir fried, not to be mean it does tasted like Panda Express fried rice. Now comes to the order of myself. meatballs noodle soup. Flavor is ok but the meatballs!! The meatballs....oh my god! For a moment I'm not sure it's real beef meatballs or something. The texture is horrible, almost like cardboard been soaked till it fall apart and mixed with some sort of cheap meat paste to create these meatballs. 2 stars for nice receptionist and nice decor.",

Didn't take any order for drinks or food.  Didn't even bother to properly seat us.  Just grabbed the menus and placed it on the table without telling us to follow.  When we asked if we were suppose to be seated, he gave a light nod so it was hard to tell what he wanted us to do.  His communication skills was lacking as if he didn't want us there.   After 15 minutes of being ignored, we left.  I don't know what their problem was but if you're going to open a restaurant until 5:30 am in the morning, you should treat all guest like they are wanted there.  Don't be surprised if any of the other 10 guys from my group rates your restaurant with a 1 star.",

Finally we got a person that was cleaning the other tables to grab us a server. The person behind the counter (owner?) ended up taking our order. No apology for their bad service.  We ordered 2 Phos and eggrolls. They brought us eggrolls and 3 Phos! The server argued with us that we ordered 3 Phos but I insisted we only order 2 since my child doesn't eat much. He took the 3rd one away and looked annoyed. When our check came, sure enough, they charged us for the 3rd pho we didn't order. My husband had to take to the guy behind the counter and finally took off our bill. Again, no apologies were given. Will never go back. Service sucks! Oh!

The spring rolls, egg rolls and crab rangoons are all delish in fact the only app I'm not a fan of is the calamari..

I came for the food not the ambience or decor. It gets packed in here. The tables are small...no elbow room at all so it feels like you have to overlap your arms with your neighbor to try and get a chopstick full of food in your mouth. The servers were servers...customer service could be improved but then again they didn't speak much English...I think that night they had nothing but Brazilians serving.  Go E.O.E.!  The food is just ok. It doesn't taste any kind of authentic...it's pretty bland. I dislike having to add salt in broth when I go to Pho restaurants and that's what I had to do here...uugh. Get the broth right please! The water cups look like they've been run through the dishwasher a thousand times too many. But the soda was good. Our bill for the 4 of us came out to be about $90...WTF?! I've never spent so much on PHO!   To sum it up...it's pricey, bland and made for tourist. I would only come here for a late nite 2am Pho craving...but then again there are other 24 hour pho places too. The bells and whistles here are nice but if you don't have the taste of the food to back it up it's just not worth it.   I like saying the restaurant name long and slow though...tickles me every time!",

The manager wanted me to pay for something I just did not like at all. He was rolling his eyes , mumbling stuff under his breath, snatching my card out from my hand , slapping things around on the table and being a complete ass about the situation. Telling me there's a 30min wait for the food and after those 30min you have to pay for ur food. I am Completely unsatisfied with this place and it's customer service. We didn't even have a waiter come to our table every so often at all to ask if we needed anything. The manager felt like he was in all the right. And his manners were just so disgusting. Who put him there? Why do they have a nasty attitude manager who can't solve problems. My situation would have been less problematic if he was understanding and more apologetic about the food that I didn't like and offering me something els to eat at least. But no. All I got was a nasty attitude. And to top it off he told me not to come back again.",

    "text": "I used to be a regular here.. with an average of 2-3 times per week; however, I have really stopped going due to the fact that the lines are longer and longer and that the food is more expensive each time I go. Items that were $4-5 or $9-12 are now in the range of $8-12 and $13-18. This is just absurd for some chicken and broccoli. Chinatown is lined with good Vietnamese restaurants and same cold service without the wait.   Pho Kim's food is delicious with a much bigger menu, but I'll rather take my business elsewhere since they have gotten so greedy and have forgotten the locals who have kept them in business for the last 15 years or so. Side note: I ordered chicken and string beans (which was always on the menu, now showing as chicken and greens) and there was a $3 up charge for the beans. REALLY? The cashier was so rude, saying how expensive the beans are and that otherwise I'll get bok choy. The order cost me $20 -- $20 for a dish that is $8,75 at ANY amazing Chinese restaurant. This was the last time I paid Pho Kim a visit. I was infuriated with the drive, the wait, the rudeness and extortion.   On another note, a server was asked about MSG content and it was divulged that they use Massive amounts of MSG in all of their food. If you feel super bloated or tired after eating at their restaurant, know that it is due to this nerve impulse transmitter that has been known to cause brain nerve damage in lab animals (unfortunately, for those little beings). This is one of the reasons why their food is so tasty and addicting. Take away the MSG and it's just plain ol' cup of noodles.   I'm happy taking it up the street when the cravings hit and saving a bunch of money while I am at it.",

    "text": "(4.5 stars)  After a long night out, my cousins and I woke up Saturday morning wanting something to fix that typical Vegas hangover. What else but pho, right?  This spot is located in Vegas's version of Chinatown, located right off the Strip. If you're taking a taxi, make sure you ask your driver for their taxi company's phone number so you have someone to pick you up. It's a frequent spot for taxi drivers, so it shouldn't take too much to describe where you're at.  Ordered the #13, which is basically pho with every type of meat. I don't know, it's not the world's best pho, but if you have the drunchies or need a cure for your hangover, this may as well be the best pho you'll have within the next hour.  Personally, my drunk Yelper self would say that they give a good ratio of noodles to broth. However, my sober and more critical Yelper self would wish there was more meat. But my drunk/hungover Yelper self wins this review.  They're open 24 hours by the way. Pho after the club? You betcha.",

From the beginning the server only came to our table 2 times during our meal once when he introduced himself and the last time was when we had been sitting there for awhile. We were asking the other people that worked there for our server and he never showed till the end. We would raise our hands and completely ignore us. The tables next to us were visited more than us. We decided not to tip for the terrible service. I signed the bill and left. My friends and I were saying good night to each other outside when THE MANAGER COMES RUNNING AFTER ME TELLING ME THAT TIP IS NOT INCLUDED. HOW RIDICULOUS!! I let him know how terrible the service was and that was the reason for the no tip. He then informed me that the tip is for everyone. I reluctantly tipped on my bill.

Luckily for me, Pho Kim Long was open :)  Now the bad: I felt that the noodles were a little thin, and the soup a bit less flavorful compared to the SoCal variety. However, I was sharing with a friend who was too afraid to order flank and tripe in the soup, so the absence of these delicious meats might have led to the unfavorable comparison.  Another thing about my friend, she won't eat flank/tripe, but she'll order an avocado smoothie...as if that's not weird.  Nonetheless, the smoothie was great. Just don't let it get warm, because then you start feeling like you're downing a cup of sweet guacamole.",

    "text": "\"CRAWFISH\" is a new addition to Pho Kim Long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  They only started offering this shellfish in June, weekends only.  My luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got:   * Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.  * Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.  * Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.  Pho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)  From this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.  I love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.  We decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.  I dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.  When I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.  For this experience, I give it a TWO stars.  Overall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.  (Pics are posted!)",

They put a lot of meat in it too which was a + in my book, but the noodles and broth are what made it for me.   Especially being in Vegas, this might save  your life the morning after a long night.

    "text": "I really wonder if they named this after Kim Long or they meant to Pho Kim Long Time. Either way, out of many many Pho restaurants I've tried in Atlanta, New York, San Diego and San Francisco, this one is one of my favorites. Only Pho I've tried in Vegas but they know what they're doing.   You'll be greeted by a huge Sea aquarium the type you see in MTV Cribs worth thousands of dollars. This place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. They have another aquarium with a King fish and black and white Nemo's. Pretty awesome!   The staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. I think everyone that was working at Pho Kim Long (I can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). We had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their Pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc.   I ordered the Bun with Egg Rolls (cho gio) and char-grilled BBQ pork. The bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. This is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. Sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. This place had perfect noodles for the Bun.   The servers gave us some Pho broth since it was so cold outside. Very nice gesture! Everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. However, if this is the Pho broth they use for every dish then I would avoid the Pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. I thought it should be more watered down. We had an additional order of fried egg rolls which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good.   Something unique about this place is their variety of Asian cuisine. They are obviously mainly Vietnamese but you can also find Chinese dishes and even Pad Thai. Very unusual in my experience. One of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. It was similar to Bo Luc Lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. I'm getting #108 next time.   Found my hangover spot a couple of miles off the strip!

One of the things that amazes me with this place is it is constantly upgrading subtle things within the restaurant the staff seamed happy for years but lately the natives are restless...  The staff almost seems stressed which I can understand because they have become too busy.   You can no longer walk in at anytime and sit down, they have a security guard at the door checking you in and taking you to the table.  The problem with this is he is not trained, at all.  We walked in and were ignored until another couple walked in and I spoke up and said \"oh we were next\"  he replied \"oh\"  I said \"do you have a check in list?\" he said \"ahh...\" I said \"why don't you write our names on that and keep track of all the people? :)\"  I am never mean and rarely rude or brash, this was getting close to my breaking point.  So anyhow he seats us and man things happen fast from there it has always been fast but this was crazy fast.  Kind of stressed me out a little bit!  No greeting from the waiter just \"are you ready to order?\" \"No but we will have a hot tea and a water\" \"ok be back\"  he comes backs and we felt we needed to be ready at this point, we ordered and the food was being served within minutes.   So a plus for fast food and a minus for somewhat unregarded service.  I had the very tame but oh so good Charbroiled Pork & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli (a cool salad perfect for 112 degree weather that evening (boy we are having a hot summer! :() My pork was perfectly done chared to perfection, my egg rolls were also perfectly done (but you can't really mess that one up right) my salad was fresh and my sauce was good as usual, however my noodles were stuck together and really hard to get apart to eat and mix into the rest of my dish.  I think this is a sad casualty of a really big and really busy place at this point.   I am totally ok with hardcore asian waiters/restaurants and what not but this place has TONS of young, hip and many races and no longer has the excuse of \"we are an old school chinese restaurant\".  You want your favorite places to get busy but not so busy they lose touch with what and who got them busy to begin with...  So I am giving stars for my food taking away for my stuck together noodles and taking away as well for the kind of crappy service from the front and the wait staff.  I will be back and will write about my next experience.  I hope this place can find the happy medium for making big bucks but remembering why and who you are making those big bucks from...",

They were too busy running around that they forgot to bring one of our friend's bowls... and she was the only one sitting there without any food when everyone else had ordered the exact same thing.

Located in Chinatown, Pho Kim Long is a short drive or cab ride away! I arrived at 2am and they were packed. No wait though which was awfully surprising. This has to be the biggest pho restaurant I've ever been to. We ordered and within seconds our food comes out! Gotta love that! My girlfriends and I shared and order of egg rolls and each had a bowl of pho. I know what you're thinking... when you're drunk, everything tastes good. And although in some circumstances that can be True, but I gotta tell you, Pho Kim Long is legit shit. And seeing that I had pho earlier that day, I realy had a fresh comparison. This broth was savory and light. I could drink the whole bowl! The meat to noodle ratio was spot on. I got the rare steak and brisket pho and everything was tender and delicious. The egg rolls were scrumptious as well. Not greasy and not too meaty.   I can see why this place is so busy. When we left one of my girlfriends decided to order some food to go and boy was that the smartest decision she's ever made! Bo luc lac for breakfast the next day? Yes!! I've never had beef this tender and I'm not even a fan of bo luc lac at all! But this just might convert me.    You bet believe your ass I'll be back!",

I've had one great experience and one OK experience when visiting Las Vegas. The rule of thumb when eating Pho is to avoid going at night (the soup taste better in the morning / early afternoon).  Pho - 3.5 / 5 stars  Egg Rolls are not that great. They're not fresh here.  The restaurant makes them in advance and re-fry them when they receive an order.  2. 5 / 5 Stars",

Good call fursure, the service was excellent, and the food was great. I got the shrimp and pork spring rolls as an appitizer and a Pho #13 Meat combination! Phoking awesome, i was feeling a lil sick and now, 2 hours later, im clear of any flu like symptoms from that Pho cure!  I cant wait to go back as they had really good looking duck on the menu, and the table next to us had this mountain of Calimari that looked to die for, i cant wait to go back, Really good price, for really good food, and really good service.",

Their pho was good and their rice plate with grilled porkchops wasn't bad either. Tried the chops with their seasoned rice (garlic fried rice) and it was just scrumptious.  They give you plenty. We also had their fried spring roll which you roll up in lettuce and dipped into the fish sauce. Yummy!!!  When we come back to Vegas we'll come and definitely eat here again.",

It's not bad, but it certainly isn't good, and it's expensive for the quality you get, man.  $5.50 for two of the shittiest spring rolls I've ever seen. It just looks skinny, sad, and... flaccid. God knows how long they've been in the fridge because the wrappers are tough. Shrimp are small, and they're just dreadfully bland.   Pho options aren't the good stuff, like tendon and tripe. They don't even do the legit stuff here. Their Bun Bo Hue doesn't come with blood sausage, and they don't have cooked cabbage, lemongrass, or any of that other stuff that normally comes with BBH.  Listen to the Asian people. There's no reason to eat here if it's outside of normal pho operating hours. Uber your ass down to Noodle Bar, where quality is SO much better. Nothing to see here, folks!",

My friend and I got the chiken wings with the special sauce. After an immature giggle, we took a bite and couldn't stop reaching for them. Apparently the sauce was just fish sauce...

I usually get #13 the beef bowl if I want pho, but their chicken pad Thai and their Mongolian beef with white rice is amazing. Service is ok, friendly but they don't talk much.

There's something for everyone to enjoy. I know other reviews had mentioned that their customer service lacked a bit, but from the experience I had the workers were pretty attentive to our table and came by to check on us frequently. I noticed as we were leaving that they were open 24/7 as well! Not a bad place to come when you're craving some late night/early morning pho and bites to tackle the day!",

I ordered the combination pho for takeout and can't believe the quantity of food. It fed 3 people! So much noodles I could have made pad thai with the leftover.   When it comes to taste, it was good, but I've had better pho in Spring Mountain. Might stop by one day to try their other dishes.",

You wave your hand calling for one's attention and they ignore you, straight up! They look the other way. That's why we had 4 different ones.   I had a better service at a 'mom and pop' pho place in San Diego than this place, considering this is a tourist town. Their egg roll is rock solid. One order is 4 pieces, unlike 6 in SD. Their calamari is oilier than a porn stars butt!   Not coming back!! Seriously, just go somewhere else. 1000+ people and this place has 3+ average. Go figure!",

The food was subpar, the wait is crazy long, and most importantly the service wasn't that great. So what makes this place special? I'm no entirely sure, maybe I just caught them on a bad day. The one thing that had me really not happy was that when my girlfriend and I wanted to pay our bill, they took the money quick but didn't bring back our change. Not sure if they were just expecting us to leave and forget about our change, but it seemed like they did that to a few tables. Very sketchy thing to do.   Anyways, I think any other Pho place would be just as good as this one. Way overhyped and not worth the wait. And definitely not worth them trying to just keep your change.",

One because someone I am at lunch with people who picked the place or two because I really, really want Pho and the people I am with are newbies to Pho and might not order Pho. Since, they offer other Asian eats, it is almost a win-win for everyone.  With that being said, my service here is never consistent. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is horrible. I will say it is consistent about one thing, it is NEVER great.  I have had problems with getting my food on occasions. One time I ordered Pho and my friend ordered pad Thai. Well my Pho came right when she was done eating her pad Thai. Livid. I was going to send it back but because my friend treated me to lunch, I did not want to be rude.  The Pho itself is not bad. It isn't great. It has a decent broth. It lacks in ingredients however, and just leaves me wanting more. More meat, more flavor, more something.  But this place is always crowded, so maybe I am missing out on something.",

However, the service here is still weird....servers are still miserable and unfriendly...I've come to accept it as fact that they don't like us because we're not Vietnamese.  Combine that with all of the drunks that come in here during the late night and early morning hours and they have a generally bad disposition to outsiders coming to eat here.

The tables are very clean, but I wish restaurants like these didn't leave soup spoons out in the open..it's a little semi-unsanitary since I've seen kids be very touchy-feely.   SERVICE: 3 - The service was good, but seemed very unorganized! I could never find my server as he ran all over the restaurant to wait tables. They might need to afford more staff, but there was never a moment that I had to wait a very long time for something to be done; except for getting someone to take my bill for change!   FOOD: 4 - good food, no matter what you order! and trust me, me and my friend ordered a lot! The salt and pepper chicken wings are my favorite dish.

The calamari was alright, lightly seasoned.   The vietnamese coffee was perfect. It was strong and it worked wonders after a long week of work.   We went there around 4:30pm and there was no wait. We got seated quickly and the servers were great.",

Flavours were rich and they are open for late night eats. The spring rolls are monster big and come with a generous serving of leafy lettuce in which you can wrap your spring roll in. Menu offering is plentiful and the place was busy at 10 pm when we were here. For late night eats this is a very good option. Would I come back. Absolutely hells yes!",

I can't eat at a restaurant where the employee don't care because it makes you wonder what's going on in the back ... I have given them plenty of chances I'm a local I live close by so I come a lot and it took me forever to decide that they just aren't a top pho restaurant anymore ... I was trying to justify the service, I would say to myself maybe they are short staff , maybe they are just having an off day but nope they just don't care how they handle customers.. maybe they shouldn't stay open 24 hours if their employees are tired and can't give the service that's expected ...",

    "text": "Great food, trash service, almost not worth my money.  Originally when I had come here, I almost gave this restaurant 3 stars. But after my recent Postmates order, I brought my review down to a 2.  Food: Food is great, a little better than the pho you'd find in the inland empire in California. Portions match the price on the menu and you'll most likely not finish your food. One pho dish is enough for two people!  Service: This is where the restaurant falls completely short. I can't fathom of how poor quality the service is at this restaurant. The first time I came here, they got our food wrong, they took hella time to bring out our food, and the man that picked up our check left our card and receipt lying somewhere. We had to raise hell to make them find our check. More recently, my friend had put in a Postmates order through them and when the food arrived, a lot of our food were missing. They had labeled the wrong soup so my other friend ended up getting my other friend's meatballs, they didn't get us enough utensils, didn't bother giving us a good amount of napkins, and to top if all off, they forgot to even make my whole order. I wanted the special combination beef pho bowl but it didn't even make it to the food line. Good thing Postmates decided to refund the payment.  Overall, if you are a glutton for punishment, I suggest coming here. The food quality is great, but if you want to be treated absolutely poorly, be their guest.",

We went yesterday and we were seated in about 5 mins. When they took us to our table they set the menus down and the guy just left. Cool, we are looking at the menus. This other guy comes (about 5 mins later so by this time we are ready to order) and doesn't even acknowledge us he just puts the waters on the table and leaves. About a couple mins later our server comes and we order our appetizer and our food. ALL of the food comes out about 8 mins later but we were bummed we didn't get our appetizer first but whatever. At this point we are eating our food which is delicious, but no one came to check up on us or refill our water or see if we needed anything. We were trying to flag people down but they just kept on walking right by us !! HELLO !? We still waited like 10 mins after we were done with our food to see if they would bring the check and so I could add a boba to our order. NO ONE CAME ! I had to chase someone down to pay and order my boba. After I paid (cash) I was organizing it back in my wallet in front of the register and the guy was like \"move over there\". I wanted to walk out so bad when he said that but I had already paid for my boba. Safe to say I will be taking my business elsewhere from here on out, your food is great but last nights experience was horrible.",

Parking can be hard to find in the small plaza since there are a lot of other stores around and plenty more being added!  Inside is big and roomy and not tidy clean but what do you expect?  I usually always get their Vietnamese iced coffee because it's so good!! Love how strong it is and I always have to pace myself when drinking it so I don't drink it all and leave the ice.  Then I get a large bowl of pho tai with beef on the side! Their broth is quite good.  Recently I tried their egg rolls and they're super crispy! I think I will order this again next time.  Their shrimp rolls were eh... wouldn't order again. Something about it tasted weird.   Also they're open 24/7!! How perfect for Vegas!",

Such as, a waiter dropping some food on the floor as she was on the way to serve her diners. She picked up the droppings and subtly put it back onto the plate before placing the plate of food down without their awareness. I only realized this after eating and waiting for our check. I definitely told the couple once I saw what happened.   WARNING: Do not come here unless you like debris in your food. The dishes are bland and distasteful and her action was revolting. I rarely give a bad review but people must know how they operate. Go at your own risk.",

The broth was lacking in flavor cmon it's all about the broth. The meat quality were poor especially the meatballs wtf you could taste the dryness after every chew it was like chewing on a gum that had the flavor sucked all out of it already.   I looked over the menu and it was all over the place. They serve many varieties of dishes from noodle soup, rice dishes, duck, fishes to family meal that offer several courses. Seems like the large variety of food options that are offered is causing less attention to what's really important QUALITY!   I will not be returning! Quality over everything!",

If I were stuck in Vegas and had an extreme pho craving, Pho Kim Long would definitely qualify.  But seriously, the REAL reason anyone comes here...24 hour pho? This is the greatest godsend ever! Especially when the typical food options (Secret Pizza, Tacos El Gordo) are closed and you have nothing else left. I've always said pho was the #1 hangover food available. Why bother waiting until the morning...just get it right after da club son!",

(: I wish it weren't so packed all the time, and would even recommend them to open a new location that can fit all those drunk dummies that make up a majority of their clientele. I look forward to the take out, and even enjoy seeing that big beautiful healthy fish they always have in the tank, he always looks so happy, unlike all the workers.

This location's situated in a bustling plaza with neighboring Asian comfort food restaurants, but I can't think of a soup more soothing and remedial than pho.  A bowl of pho will run you about $8-9 here, a little more than average, but that's Vegas for you. One star off simply because I've had deeper and richer broths before. But four stars because it's 24/7, the service takes care of you, and it does the job of nourishment.",

After food is done they they drop you check and go..then wait for you to pay. There host are walkie talkie connected. So when you say tip is at the table they dispatch as host to collect your tip. And they will tell you if are short of their expectations of their tip. Never never never again. The taste is not worth the tip shakedown. I wouldn't put a star but that is the only way I can educate you on stay away from a business that demands a tip for their service even though they have the right to do what they want with their business...",

    "text": "As a genuine Vietnamese and a person who had eaten here every single day in Las Vegas, I would say this restaurant is the best Vietnamese restaurant in town. People in Vegas apparently have the same thoughts with me. As the restaurant did not take a reservation, the customers usually walk-in, stand for twenty minutes to half an hour to get a table. And yet, people just kept coming and patiently waiting with no rush at all. We even met a family who had come all the way from Colorado to Vegas to eat here. What a surprise! The Pho here is even better than some Pho I had in Florida and D.C. The broth was cooked so awfully well with the real taste of beef bones, oxtail (perhaps), with some spices like Vietnamese cinnamon sticks, cloves, coriander seeds, star anise, and cardamom. The Pho here is very Southern Vietnamese style, and I like it, even though I am from the North. Not only that, the Charbroiled Beef with Vermicelli which was not listed on the menu was delicious.  For those of you who want to try, just tell the server that you want \"Bun Bo Xao\", as \"Bun\" is the rice vermicelli, \"Bo\" is beef, and \"Xao\" is the method of cooking. The Vietnamese Iced Coffee is excellent too. Overall, if you are craving for a piece of Spring Roll or Pho, head nowhere else but exactly Pho Kim Long restaurant.",

It's a pretty popular place on the strip, and there is a wait whether you go for Sunday lunch or for late night drunk munchies during the weekend. The good thing is that the waits are never usually that long; service is quick and efficient.   My go to items:  - Kim Long Fried egg rolls; comes with a dipping fish sauce, lettuce to wrap the egg roll in, and pickled veggies to top it off  - Pho with brisket only; tender and delicious  I've also tried and enjoyed: - Rice Vermicelli with charbroiled chicken or pork + egg rolls; rice noodle topped with fresh chopped lettuce, fresh veggies, charbroiled meat and sliced egg rolls, also comes with fish sauce to add in - Crispy calamari; salt and pepper, very flavorful, comes with a Mozzarella dipping sauce - Mongolian beef; add spice to your liking, very tasty and comes with white or brown rice   Pho Kim Long is convenient and a restaurant my friends and I go to at least once a month. Fast service, good prices, and filling dishes!",

On top of that it's located right off of the free and close the the strip. Depending on the time of the day you go parking can be tough, but 99% of the time you will find some, it might be a bit of a walk.   Upon entrance we have never waited more than 10 minutes. Their table turnovers are relatively quick. It's always at least half full to nearly entirely full. This restaurants brings in a lot of regulars.   Our waiters are always very friendly and attentive. The menu is very straight forward and easy to order. The ambience and look has a very transitional Asian feel. This makes it look like you'll be eating authentic food. Once we have our orders placed it didn't actually take our food very long.    I always order the traditional pho. The soup bowls are rather large. If you don't have a large stomach I recommend you share and split between 2 people. The broth is perfect. Not too salty and not too bland. I love mine spicy so I always ad chili. The hoisin sauce is also good if you want more salt. It won't ruin or change the flavor of the broth too much. The noodles have a great texture and man is it good. I love the vegetables on be side allowing you to customize the amount of veggies you want.    I always order egg roles to go. The egg roles come with veggies and a lettuce wrap with some sauce on the side. Some people don't know this but you're supposed to wrap the egg role into the lettuce so it gives it both a refreshing and savory flavor. It is a must every time you come!   Pho is good, but coming to pho Kim long is GREAT! Please.. check this place out if you're ready to get full! And even if you're on a diet like everyone else nowadays haha! :)",

The restaurant offers many different options ranging from pho to more specialty dishes such as caramelized clay pot fish. We ordered the pho and spring rolls. The pho only comes in two sizes small or large. If you're from a state that has tons of pho restaurants (e.g colorado, Cali..) their large is like a medium at the restaurants in colorado.   The pho was okay. I guess I'm spoiled because the pho in Denver is just amazing. What I didn't like was their meatballs, it had a really weird taste, like it had just been thawed from the freezer or something. The veggies that were served with the pho were definitely old. I always eat basil with my pho, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat theirs. They also forgot to bring out our spring rolls, which we ended up canceling... i guess when you're that busy... it's bound to happen.  Service was quick and the servers were nice during the little interactions that we had. Overall I can see why this restaurant could be a hit... because when you're intoxicated... everything tastes good.",

The tables were sticky and wet. The place wasnt busy and yet they didnt get our order right. The food wasnt anything great. And when it came time to pay the rude cashier made us tip. We already had left cash on the table and he accused us of not doing so. And he proceeded to charge it on our card.  Of all the pho places in vegas this one was the worst. PLEASE dont wast your time here. Go somewhere else like pho so 1, viet noodle bar. Anywhere but here!!",

In the past this hasn't been a big deal, and shouldn't have been a big deal today as the restaurant wasn't busy at all.   I go to the cashier to pay my share of the bill and the guy has a very clear passive aggressive attitude about the hassle of splitting the check. When I go to ring up, I noticed that the bill was also higher than normal. I figured it was because gratuity was included so I asked him to clarify, he said it wasn't. The lazy bum actually charged me more for having to split checks! It was only a few bucks so I didn't want to create a fuss about it.   Low and behold, we leave and my group realizes he did that to everyone. Long story short, large parties beware if you split checks, they probably will charge you the wrong amount and be passive aggressive about it.",

There used to be a big banner hanging on top of the restaurant's name saying, \"Voted the best pho in town.\" Recently it had been taken down. Came here early in the morning since most Vietnamese restaurants open at 11 am and I guess coming here was a bad decision.  First off, the portion sizes. The spring rolls were so small and just most of the meals served are small. My girlfriend ordered a large bowl of pho and it was small!  Secondly, my vermicelli I ordered was very greasy and I managed just to eat a quarter of it before I had to discard it.  Lastly, customer service is mediocre; could've been more better. Usually handing change to your customer is the way to go but I guess the guy doing transactions thinks slamming my paper and coins on the counter was the most acceptable form.  I was so dissatisfied and disappointed me and my girlfriend went to another Pho place that was so much better around the afternoon.",

    "text": "After the inaugural podcast with local artists, The 80's Kids, we decided to check out our favorite Pho place in the valley!  PKL is a place I've been frequenting since moving to Las Vegas 6 years ago.  This 24 hour joint offers some of the best Pho I've tasted.  On my drive over, my mouth salivated with anticipation for what was about to happen!  It's located on Spring Mountain and Valley View in a super long Chinese themed strip mall.  To me, this building signifies the beginning of Chinatown.  It says, I have arrived in Las Vegas' Asian scene and makes me feel right at home!  When you get into the restaurant, there's a pretty tight seating area.  The idea, though, is to have a lot for tables for dining.  The place is decked out with different tones of brown, Vietnamese and other Asian inspired design and art.  Statues of elephants and Asian soldiers gives an extra accent to the place.  Our service was a little sub par.  The server wasn't the most personable.  Didn't greet us.  Just came over and asked if we were ready to order.  At the end of the night, we literally had to walk up to him to get our check.  Thank goodness the food was good...  For my meal, I always, get number 15:  Beef Pho Noodle Soup with rare steak and brisket for around $8.  This soup is on point!  The soup is packed with thin strips of brisket and rare steak.  The rareness continued to cook in the warm broth.  The noodles were thin but plentiful.  There was also green onions in the dish, served with bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos and basil stems on the side.  All components offer a different but pleasant texture and flavor.  All seemed to mesh very well together.  But let's talk about the star of the show: the broth.  The broth is what sealed the deal for the dish and real brought a flavorful effect.  It wasn't too salty or overpowering.  It's was just right.  Warm and packed with beef flavor.  SO GOOD!!!  Listen, if you haven't tried Pho Kim Long yet, you are definitely missing out!  Like mentioned before, this joint stays open all night.  Great for monsoon season, winter season and after a night at the clubs.  Look for the Chinese strip mall and stop by!",

The Chicken Teriyaki plate came with 3 pieces of broccoli and 3 carrot slivers, a side of rice and overly drenched in sauce chicken. The veggies were cold and there was a piece of hair on the broccoli.  Spring rolls were decent but lacked flavor. BBQ and the Pho was surprisingly delicious and hot.

I have never waited longer than 5-10 minutes to be seated even if I have a large group. It is always busy, but still the service stays consistent and fast. Sure, the guy may be a tad short when they take your order but he is busting his ass! I love the atmosphere, it is very clean as well. I usually try to do something different every time. I tried the Drunken Noodle last night, not my usual taste but none the less delicious! And made perfectly. The combination fried rice is deadly, you will want to eat a whole family size portion if you try!! My boyfriend usually gets the orange chicken which is super good too. I've been here at least ten times and it never disappoints me. So many choices on the menu, and they're all good. :)",

Since my judgment was impaired, I threw calorie counting caution to the wind and charged ahead.   This is not haute cuisine so take this in context of what it is- it's an Asian eatery that's open late, they are prompt, semi accurate with food order and no, they are not shooting for any Michelin stars here.   Expect noise, bustle, several fish tanks sans ANY fish (overhead, lol) and nice greasy and fatty fare.   We ordered salt and pepper calimari to share and I got my fave, beef stew. My noodles were not ones I ordered, so there's the semi accuracy. Who cares, I ate them anyway. Chunks of beef were huge and deliciously fatty, broth was thick and savory and price was right.   Place was packed at midnight on Wednesday, good mix of couples, families with little kids (yup, at midnight), just friends hanging out.   I recommend this place if you are hungry, in the area, in the mood for noodles, and are familiar and comfortable with service model of a typical family owned Asian food joint. It's efficient, tasty and will fill you up at a good $.  Don't come hiking across town just because they have 2000+ reviews :)",

That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in \"Viva Las Vegas\" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open \"almost\" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )  The place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!  All in all, I have no complaints, I highly recommend Pho Kim Long especially after a hard night of partying in the city that never sleep!   Enjoy!",

So I drove to the dirty, dingy little place and made my order, and told the manager how rude the person on the phone was. He didn't seem to care much, which just made the experience more uncomfortable. And to top it off, the food was mediocre at best.  The only interesting thing they have going for them is their name is almost funny.",

After circling Las Vegas for about an hour, we finally settled upon Pho Kim Long again. I mean, why fight it. It has decent pho, it's fast and it's open no matter what time of day.  They redecorated or something, and now everything is varying shades of diarrhea brown.  The help were very angry here. The waiter was not amused with us and was not very happy to answer our questions about portion size. The pho was again decent, so that's all that matters, but they got a new menu and raised prices slightly.   And it smelled like feet in there.  Between the cheese-smelling plane, and the feet-smelling restaurant, I was done for the night. But phull of happy-pho-ness.",

I went here one time when I first arrived in Vegas and haven't been again which now I have been here a year and a half. The food is average. Nothing special that I haven't had elsewhere. I have lived various places and the Pho doesn't taste unique or anything. Good but taste the same as others. My kids had the orange chicken which they didn't really like. It was probably good but they are kids. The spring rolls and crab ragoons are great. It is nice that it is open 24 hours. I have a Pho place near me so I doubt I would drive all the way cross town for something I can get near me that taste the same. All in all a great Pho place especially since it is 2 4 hours so it's perfect for late night cravings. It is a little fancier than your average Pho place and bigger, too. So maybe if you have guest from out of town, it maybe worth it. They have a good selection of foods. Can't complain too much there.",

Walking in there the Pho smell is pretty much hugging you like a warm blanket. The place is huge and not fancy by any means. The service was fast and without frills. We had the fresh spring rolls and pot stickers. I always eat Pho Ga (chicken Pho), it was delicious! For all you folks that suffer like me from the unexplainable cilantro-phobia I asked them if they could leave it out. They actually did. That's not common, often they say they do, but if e.g. the chicken is prepared in advance en masse, they try to take it out, more or less successful. And if you are like me, even if you can't see it and you bite into one little piece of cilantro-that's it. I can't eat the dish. The broth was so flavorful, the chicken not dry, the condiments were plenty and fresh. We will be back!",

It's the place to go after a long night of drinking or when it's cold outside and you're craving for a hot soupy bowl of noodles.  The ambiance is pretty nice- clean place, nicely decorated. Food-wise though, I've has much better. I think it's because of the volume of business they get. There is so many people that the kitchen churns out food at top speeds, compromising the quality of it.   The portions are not bad noodle-wise but they are pretty stingy with the beef slices. It makes for a very incongruous looking bowl of pho- plenty of white noodles with 3 tiny thin strips of beef. Also, the spring rolls were just okay (at best) -I was not impressed for what was supposedly \"the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas\". I've had so much better in small mom-and-pop restaurants in Los Angeles.  Service is top-notch. The waiters/waitresses are very attentive and see to your needs really well.   The only reason I will return is that this place is open 24 hours. It's either this or Denny's.....and I might give the local Denny's a try next time.",

It actually has a hint of sweetness, and not enough Pho flavor if you know what I mean.  It's different; hard to explain.  I like to come here for the fried chicken appetizer, the spring rolls, fried egg rolls, and of course the Vermicelli bowls; you can never go wrong with Vermecelli because you pour the fish sauce in for taste!  I like the significant amount of vegetables they put in their vermecelli bowls - I like to think it's healthy!

This place has a lot of Chinese dishes as well that looked amazing. The prices are affordable.  My only gripe is I wished the iced coffee was brewed in front of me like I've had before. This place is open late!!",

It is always packed but I have never waited too long, not a lot of room to wait but who cares because the food is bomb and you really don't wait that long.  Huuuuge menu and we like to try new things but my favs are by far - a big ol' bowl of Pho! Add broccoli because that's how I roll, I love my greens. The Drunken Noodles are awesome....I could def eat that whole plate myself, my boyfriend and I usually order a couple different things, meat plate, veggie plate like buck choy and then pho - we def get into the family style dining. That's what is so awesome - you can get your own thing or share!  Boba is great, smoothies are really good and the spring rolls are always a starter. and then you can catch an awesome show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre right behind it afterwards :)",

If you don't understand enough English to comprehend what your customer is saying then please do not insist that you are correct when you have no understanding of the situation. He had no idea what we were upset about and kept arguing with us for no reason. And then to top it off, because he was heated about his misunderstanding, he told the server to take back our food. What kind of manager handles a customer service situation in that way? So disappointing as I've been a patron of this place for years. It only takes one horrible manager to make an establishment look unprofessional.",

Also, the waiter asked us if we wanted a large or small but when the bill came out, the small bowl of pho was the same price as the large.... Uhhhhh what?..   I think this place is all just hype. There's nothing special about it besides the catchy name. The restaurant looks nice but food? Ehh... My friend is a True pho lover and can eat pho 1-2x a week and even she didn't like this place....

TBH I didn't expect much; I come from a place where the best pho are made.   When I got there MLK DAY the line was out the door and the wait was a short 10 minutes. I order the usual pho Dac Biet with extra meat on the side and was quite satisfied with the flavor of the soup. The meat was good too; I mean it's pretty standard.   What was lacking was the size and the composition of goodies that come with a combo. I had zero tripe, very little brisket, and very little else. The spring roll we ordered was also a bit pricey at 6 dollars for 2.   It definitely did the job making me feel better though.",

I selected #28, Hu Tieu (seafood pho); got egg noodles instead of the rice noodles that I requested. Broth was interesting as it had a strong ginger finish but that didn't make it good. The ingredients were WAY over-cooked to the point that I thought the squid were random pieces of wonton that had fallen into the pot, completely devoid of flavour and with a splatty texture. Shrimp were pink and white curly cues pared from superball material and the cheapy sort, very small sans tail. The sliced jalepenos musta been prepped last week as they were brown around the edges and flaccid.  Left without the usual \"Pho FUPA\" that I've come to associate with consuming a bowl full of love due the small serving size and sub-par ingredients.  There are heaps of better Pho joints in Vegas- go to one of them.",

It's not too far off the strip, which is a plus and it's open 24hrs.  Food wise i would say this place could do better, but it's not bad. The only problem i have with this place is when I ordered a Large Pho Tai i was given only 6 slices of meat (lol a large and all you get is 6 slices of beef??)  The prices at Pho Kim Long is a bit pricier than i'm used to for pho (around $8 a bowl), but since we were in Vegas I wont be complaining that much on the price  Overall it was a decent experience and i would recommend anyone who has a hangover or is just drunk to try this place out",

We got there around 10:30 on a Friday night, and it was packed in that huge restaurant! Luckily, no long pho Kim wait for us, and we were seated within minutes.   One aspect of this pho joint that stood out from any other pho place I've been to is their excellent service. Everyone that came by was so friendly, even though the restaurant was packed and busy. Usually I feel like I'm always being rushed, but never did we feel like they were trying to turn tables like a mother pho'cker.   My wife and I both got the rare beef pho and an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls weren't the greatest, but the rare beef pho was pretty pho'ckin good (probably tasted better cuz we were super hungry and haven't had pho in awhile). The broth was also pretty hearty and flavorful.   They are also open 24 hrs! Pho'ck yes! We'll def be back, especially if we ever have some late night pho cravings.",

The best part? they are open 24/7. Who doesn't love having a big bowl of pho after partying all night, right? But ever since they changed management I feel like they stopped caring and the service got worse. You used to have to share whatever you ordered because it was too much (Never a bad thing!) and it was reasonably priced, oh and delicious by the way.. We used come here at least twice a week because we live right around the corner and who doesn't get the munchies at 2am? When we saw the change happen, the prices went up (understandable, they were getting busier) but the quantity was tiny! Way to go!! (said sarcastically).. We stopped coming here for a while and decided to try other places. But I have to admit, their Pho is definitely my favorite (for now). So I decided to keep coming here only when I have the cravings for pho, oh and any of their smoothies (add boba) they are delicious! and you must try their fried calamari.. Make sure you have time to wait, especially on the weekend because they are packed! Service is not the best but I don't mind because I'm just there for the Pho.. lol",

I'm a bigger fan of the rice dishes, especially com ga roti (roasted chicken and rice)  than the soups. I had bun bo hue for the first time at the place and the broth was watered down. They didn't give any porks blood either which is a classic component for this dish (even if some are repulsed by it). They barely also give any meat. The pho was better but I wouldn't call it the best. It does its job if you're craving pho after a night out of having fun though. 3 Stars for its decency and the sentimental value the place has for my fam.",

I always get the chicken pho whenever I'm here with a side of spring rolls.   It's always busy here! Service is really a hit or miss. But more so I've experience more unpleasant over good service here over time. I know it can get busy but that doesn't mean your customers should be treated in such rude manners. Rarely do we get any cheerful greetings here. The servers just drop your pho on the table with no caution at all with almost spilling the hot soup on you.   It always seems that we have to chase down a waiter for asking for water, condiments and such. Prices are reasonable like any other pho place. They only have one size bowls. Wait all depends on how busy it is. Just expect that you'll wait because it's such a popular place. It's a mad rush I tell ya. But pho always hits the spot whenever it's cold outside.",

My favorite appetizer there has to be the Egg Rolls with the lettuce wrap and fish sauce!  It's usually crowded here, and the servers are all over the place.

Food is very good, prices are competitively reasonable, food delivery is quick but customer service sucks especially when they get busy which is usually most of the time. It's not the long wait that irked us but rather the disrespect when they serve. This happened to my family and guests of 7 just hours ago during dinner time. I'm in the service industry and my job emphasizes respect especially to customers. I've never seen anywhere that I've dined in where in the middle of the meal, they already served us the bill even though none of us asked for it. Maybe not a Vietnamese culture but rushing the bill to the guests is like telling them to \"eat fast, pay the bill, and get the hell out because there are other customers waiting to be served.\"  Then after serving the bill, they started to bus our plates and the worst part happened. I was still finishing my favorite dish when a waiter stood right behind me while extending his arm trying to reach my plate and asked me if I'm done?!? Was this f@&%ing guy serious or what? Not even a word of politeness like \"excuse me ....\". It was just plain rudeness. Sure enough, I got pissed off and hastily paid the bill and reported the incident to the bald-headed supervisor/manager over which, he offered a free replacement of the dish which I was finishing. The damage was done and turned down the freebie, told him that WE will write some negative reviews about our experience and just walked out. So this is my honest review of the place and probably my last too. And watch out for that automatic gratuity TIP that they charge which is usually around 15%-18%. These guys will be tongue-tied to tell about it and sucker any generous ignoramus into OVER tipping them.",

Anyways back to today...the pho there was a little salty..saltier than normal, i asked for side onions and the waiter gave me a look with an attitude (i mean dude just go get me some onions i asked nicely), lastly if most of u guys don't know this...most restaurants charge u 15%-20% extra gratuity if u have a party of 7 or more in your party and well the waiter or waitress there will let u know that gratuity was added to the bill...here they charge you 17% for a party of 5 or more...don't a word about the gratuity added to the bill. $57 dollar meal today for a party of 5 which is cheap...$9 dollars for gratuity which was added automatically...and if i didn't ask for a copy of the receipt i would have gave them another 9 dollars on top for tip again...and for what? crappy service from fools that pretty much slide my food over and not say a word to acknowledge me that my order is ok i got or not? and the guys weren't even busy and i had to ask for my check 4 x before they brought it to me. they lucky that this is one of the few 24 hour places my friends like to go. but from now im going to refrain as much as i can. was very very disappoint with them today",

I would have to say my friends and I were very disappointed with what we ordered.  I couldn't describe the flavor in the broth.  It seem like they just bought the cubes you buy at supermarket to make pho and stuck in the pot.  The egg rolls were thin and barely had any meat.  One of my friends ordered Hu Tieu and didn't finish it because it wasn't good.  I guess if you are in Vegas and drunk after clubbing than it wouldn't hurt to check this place out since it's the only Pho restaurant open 24 hours over there.

Their pho is probably the worst I have ever had, the broth is literally tasteless and has maybe a couple of scallions floating in it.  They give you the usual plate of veggies on the side, but their veggies are not fresh enough and the plate is almost entirely bean sprouts (not enough lime, jalapeno, thai basil, etc).  Their fresh spring rolls were not good, they fried the tofu in them and wilted the wrapper (ugh!).  Do not come here if you are vegetarian, they have literally nothing on the menu (no veggie pho, no broth that is not chicken or beef, tofu spring rolls were special order).  Also important to note, this place is not authentically Vietnamese- their hot and sour soup was not the clear vietnamese style with pineapple but the chinese style with dark broth.  What is up with that?  Thai tea was mediocre, doesnt compare to anywhere in the area.  Service here is off the charts bad, I am talking waiters that are actually rude (not just neutral).  With so many great options in the same area that are open equally late, I would never return here.",

They never smile, they act as if every thing bothers them. They took the chopsticks holder off our table and set it at another without saying a word. Then when they brought my food out 20 mins later I had to ask for them back. The gentleman looked annoyed and grabbed a holder off another table and set it down at the opposite end from where I was sitting. Then continued to walk away without saying a word. Absolutely terrible service. Even when my boyfriend and I had stated that we were waiting for my food even though his had been brought soon after we ordered, the waiters acted as if it was whatever. My boyfriend waited for my food but they took so long that I told him to eat. He finished his food before mine even came. Un-freaking-believable. No empathy, no apology, nothing.

    "text": "This place is clean and authentic! Two words you cannot put together for any other Vietnamese restaurants ;D The only downside is that it is off the strip, so getting a cab back is...... IMPOSSIBLE. But still worth it. I came her in the afternoon after three consecutive nights of partying until 6am. I was sober and not hungover, so I know the food was good! A quick cab ride away from Aria, roughly about $12-13 or so without tip. Located in a plaza or square, but we didn't look around and went straight for business. The windows/doors were darkened so you couldn't peep inside. Once you walk in you will realized this place is rather big, and set like a Chinese seafood/dim sum restaurant. Had to use the restroom, and they have automatic flush. I don't believe I have seen this at any Asian restaurants before! And the bathroom had many stalls and was actually clean. BIG BIG PLUS! Food came pretty quickly. I ordered cha gio (egg rolls), 4 stars. Sorry no pix as it was far from me since we had a large group. It was mighty tasty with a variety of fillings.  Pho bo vien (beef ball pho) - 4.5 stars! I think that was about $7, so it is a little more pricey than your ghetto places, but I think I would rather spend extra money for clean, good food. Soup tasted yummy and authentic, and the regular bowl was actually not too big for me for once. They gave you plenty of bean sprouts, basil, limes, and jalepenos so you don't have to fight your friends...... PLUS! I tried my friend's potstickers, they were crunchy with a pork and veggie filling. It was juicy and tender on the inside. The sauce that accompanied it was well seasoned. It was seasoned soy sauce or something with spring onions. YUMMMMMM. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=EGVRX4BXHP6Vm10J6JrTJA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxD...</a> I ordered a coconut juice as well, that crap was expensive! I think $5 or something, but it tasted so good :) Everyone seemed pretty happy with their food. And I would say the dishes all looked yummy. I will be back..... if I decide to stand outside for 20-30 minutes trying to catch a cab again. We'll see........",

Me and my buddies came here on the last day of our edc weekend before the long drive back to SF.  *Warning - do not order the fruit drinks, they are made w/ powder and taste super generic and sweet aka fake. We were like oh its 137 degrees outside, a nice watermelon, or pineapple, or strawberry drink sounds amazing and refreshing, when we got it we all literally took one sip and didn't drink it after that.  Oh but they looked like they could glow in the dark, i guess that's kinda cool?   On top of that the pho took forever to come, maybe they forgot, but the ones who ordered rice plates pretty much finished it before the pho even came.  Pho should take no more than a few minutes to come out, not over 10 minutes.  I must say it's understandable for the ones including myself to finish our rice plates first because portion wise they were probably made for babies. I had one tiny porkchop and some rice, usually at Vietnamese restaurants you're not able to see the bottom of your plate because its filled with food, but this plate was very bare.    Bottomline: food took forever, drinks sucked, and for 5 guys the bill came out to $80. Pho'ck that.  OH and on top of that, they gave us the bill before our pho even came! (probably because they noticed some of our plates empty) wow...best believe we didn't tip.",

Clean and simple, but I've had better peanut sauce that comes with it. The sauce was pretty much like sweet peanut butter paste..yuck. Luckily, the usual sauces that comes on table, made a quick fix.  Second, the pad thai was yummy. We got it not too spicy and also w shrimp. Good choice. Lastly we tried the fried seabass. I think ill stick w japansese style fish. I just think that's more my style. I really wanted a hot tea, but felt like after all the hustle and bustle to get our order in, and that lack of attentiveness post order, I felt it was best to just go. Overall it was ok.!",

Period.   It was very packed for the time we went in, which was about 8 or so, so we had to wait a little while for an open table. I think we were seated first before a few other groups because we were a larger group. The menu isn't exactly anything to go ga-ga over, as their cuisine ranked about the same as most Pho restaurant's I've been to, but they do get major points for being open all night.   The food came out quickly and was piping hot, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Worth a second trip? I think so.",

    "text": "Oh sweet Pho Kim Long, the memories we've shared. I can't even begin to count the many drunk nights and hungover mornings spent sipping the miracle broth of Pho Tai, or the awkward dates spent loading it with all of the bean sprouts, lemon juice, and hoisin sauce it can hold to sidetrack myself from the shmuck on the other side of the table.  I love this place. I'm a long time Pho-lover and have been to dozens of restaurants serving Vietnamese and Thai food, but Pho Kim Long is my favorite - and not just because of the daring name ;)  First, they're open 24 hours. Meaning you can stumble in wasted at 3AM on a Saturday and they won't blink twice - as long as you don't stir trouble, or enjoy a lovely non-traditional Thanksgiving day brunch to avoid family members - which I haven't done but have certainly been tempted to. You can also order for pick up.   I enjoy that the atmosphere feels fitting for a plethora of different occasions. The restaurant is always clean and has the kind of feel to it where you can easily come here to enjoy a nice date, or to end a night of partying in casual attire. Or call ahead to pick up food and eat it at home in your pajamas - you know, whatever.  In general I've stuck with my time tested favorite, Pho Tai - thinly sliced rare beef thrown into a tasty broth and loaded with bean sprouts, noodles, lemon, onions, and what else your heart desires as long as the kitchen has stock. Expect to pay $7-8 for a generously portioned bowl. However, the many times I've been here with friends everyone has been satisfied with their non-Pho choices. If your stomach can hold it, they also have spring rolls to die for and delicious boba smoothies. The quality of food has always been consistent.  They lose one star because, unlike the quality of their food, their service is inconsistent. I've never received truly terrible service there, and it is certainly light years above many other Chinatown joints, but you do get the feeling that some of the young waitstaff is only there because they're being forced by parents who likely share ownership.  If you're in the area and enjoy Vietnamese/Thai cuisine - check it out. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "It's the wee hours post-partying in Vegas + we were hungry... I busted out my phone, opened the Yelp app + in no time Pho Kim Long popped onto my screen. About 300 reviews, 2.5 stars average, one $ sign, + the words \"late-night\" as one of the highlights... Good enough for me!   No need to detail my visits to the curiously-named hot spot as all it comes down to is needing a place to fill the stomach + to sober up whether it's the wee hours or late morning. It's in a strip mall right along Spring Mountain Rd so parking is not a problem... just expect it to be a bit crowded during late hours. The selection on the menu is a decent variety of Vietnamese dishes, but the pho options are pretty limited. Regardless, somehow I find myself ordering a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=_jQ4QD84l_CUpsLD8L9LSg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxD...</a> or something similar every time. A bowl of pho is about $7-8, which is on the pricey side compared to what I'm used to both in Northern or Southern California, but the portion size is good enough. Quality is okay... soup is filled nearly to the brim, but the broth could be more flavorful + the noodles/beef are whatever. Average at best. We got spring rolls once, which were equally not noteworthy in any way other than that they actually gave us 2 peanut sauce dipping bowls... for the 3 of us. o_O <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=n7M27mi6yD0uqDjCHP6VPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxD...</a>  Perhaps next time I'll try something other than pho since most of the more positive reviews here seem to be for other items on the menu.   In retrospect, I'm sure there's better late night eats of the soupy-noodley sort in the Chinatown area or elsewhere off the Strip, but Pho Kim Long does its job. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could... but I'm rounding up. 3 stars for a convenience of this 24-hour, clean place to chow down because sometimes there's just nothing more satisfying than a steaming bowl of noodles.",

Had I had some reasoning and a little rationale I could have just stuck with their specialty...ie...the pho...duh...it's in their title name. But I went with a random picture in the menu, the roasted chicken with seasoned rice #38.  Again pictures do help especially if you're drunk, but the actual meal was nothing like the picture in the menu. The rice was super dry and the chicken was not good. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=yBVkwiixnbBbSMCEUaHOnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxD...</a>  But hey...it's in the menu and this restaurant is responsible for its contents. So just because they're specialties are pho, they should still put in some effort for the less frequented menu items including the roasted chicken and rice that I had ordered. Word!!!!  No doubt, I'll be back....and no doubt I'll be drunk again. But hopefully I should have my mental notes in place and some rationale fortitude to order the good stuff next time. Still, you can't beat the open 24 hours a day and family style dining in this Vegas off-strip restaurant.  Their name is funny too...word",

On Mother's day I went there with 10 friends at night and, mind you, the servers and all were great.. when we went to pay for our checks, they let us split our check! They ALWAYS let us split our checks EVERYTIME I GO.   The first time they didn't split my check was a couple months ago, it was my friend and her boyfriend, myself, and my boyfriend. We wanted to split the check in two. The man wouldn't let us do it! He said they never do which is an outright LIE. He kept walking around in his register area not listening to me so I got mad, but my friend paid for us all.   The next time we went, it was myself and another two people, again, they let us split our checks.  The time after that, it was myself, and four other people, and again they WOULD NOT split our checks. SAME GUY. Wish I remembered his name.. He just told us to pay some amount on our cards and pay that way but that he wouldn't ever split our checks.  Personally, I love eating there, the servers are nice. But that ONE ASSHOLE at the register is so RUDE and refuses to even LISTEN to me when I try and speak calmly.",

I don't get dry mouth after having their beef broth so that's always a good sign that they aren't using additives and MSG. They can serve their soup just a little hotter but I'm sure its to stop people from complaining about burning themselves.   Usually the service is pretty efficient. Sometimes there is a wait during the peak hours.   Other than that its pretty much your standard pho fare.",

All jokes aside,my family and I are Vietnamese and we always have to get some comfort food whenever we go to Vegas and this is our go-to place. It's a very crowded place and is open for 24 hours. We came here on december 29th around lunchtime to grab a hot bowl of pho . before heading to the mountains for a snow day. My boyfriend, who is Filipino, decided to be the outcast and got himself a rice dish with bbq meat and an egg cake. Food took pretty long even though the orders were simple, but it was fine because the whole restaurant was packed.   I got the usual pho tai because I'm basic like that. The broth was really hot and wholesome just the way I like it. My family finished within 30 minutes and the bill came quick. I don't remember the total, but it was inexpensive.  Thank you for a hot bowl of yummy pho! Pretty sure I will be back again haha.",

On a scale of 1 to 10 my level of excitement was 11.  Upon entering, one thing turned me off.  The smell!!  It smelled like they've used the same old, dirty, moldy, rag to wipe down the tables for 100000 years without washing it. The whole restaurant had an old wet towel smell to it.  Regardless, I was still excited to eat.   I ordered the Rare Steak and Brisket Pho  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#Q1aVULe4TLE41w5R-r7gWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>).  The broth was flavorful, refreshing, and not too oily.  The brisket and steak were perfectly cooked and tender.  They gave me a generous amount of noodles too!  Don't forget to ask for the side of sliced onions!  Maybe it's just  a Korean thing and we're trying to make ghetto-kimchi, haha.  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#osrvZk6r45zRC0stiCZ0tQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>)   I wouldn't recommend the chicken pho... I tried my friend's chicken pho and it just tasted like salty water-- where's the chicken flavor hmmm?",

I liked the calamari, which was served with toasted garlic and jalepenos. I'd say skip this place.",

I almost tried all options on the menu, my favorite between noddles is number 66 as combination, in rice and chicken go for 37 with seasoned rice( i called it red one) if you like fried chicken go for half fried duck , it is enough for two and taste like heaven. If you want beef go for number 110 with American brokly and one seasoned rice and it is good for two. Also between pho go for chicken one it is awesome. Put some basil in it and enjoy of a True pho taste. For seafood i just tried combination of seafood on the skillet i think it was number 133, it was good but i am not a seafood person, i am sure if you like fish and shrimp and squid you are going to like it. Be aware that there is line list to seat so get there earlier, also the busiest time is weekend around 5 pm to 3 am.( it is crazy that people go to eat at 3 am i know i am one of them) food comes fast and hot also you can customized  it if you are familiar with their seasons which i am.",

Considering this place is the go to place for drunk munchies, I liked it.   There were tons of menu options from an array of noodle dishes, phos, and rice plates. It is open super late, so after you're done partying on the strip at like 4 am, you come here to eat! Came here with my gfs and our new found friends and we got the pho. YUM. It was really good! A little on the salty side but the meat was freshly pink and the noodles was yummmmy.   The fried rice was kinda gross though. It was pretty bland and tasteless. I felt like I was just eating it just to eat it. My gf got the drunken noodles, which are the wide flat rice noodles. Kind of too oily for me but it was really good. Tons of basil flavor in it too!   Even though the rice was bad, I give this place 4 stars because it is cheap, open late, and fun place to go to after you club.",

Once our food was at the table, no one ever came to check up on us.   The pho i overpriced, the broth is not very well flavored. I was not satisfied. To pull a restaurant name like this, much more is expected.",

The salt and pepper chicken wings are a must, and their pho soups and vermicelli noodle dishes are consistently flavorful and filling. Right now they have a special appetizer of pork belly buns that are soft, sweet buns filled with BBQ pork belly, cilantro, jalapeno slices and a sriracha mayo. Divine.",

My friends ordered the typical pho bowl while I got my fave dish, bun thit nguong.  It was delish!    When it came time to paying our bill, we asked the waitress to charge certain credit cards to the specific dishes we ordered.  She had to ask us a number of times and then finally got it, supposedly.  Then when the charges came back, we realized the lady just split the bill into thirds.  Sheesh...",

Host doesn't notice you and won't seat you unless you're with a larger group. He was also extremely rude when we pointed out to him that he's walked past us several times and stood in front of us without even looking at us. I had to walk up to him and say \"Party of 2\" right in his face for him to realize I was standing there trying to be seated. And this was in the middle of the night when it wasn't very busy. There was a party of 5 in front of us which he was attentive to (and having a nice long conversation with); they all went to the bathroom so me & my boyfriend were the only 2 standing there. Instead of kindly apologizing, realizing his mistake, or trying to make our experience better, he was extremely rude about the situation. Because of that, we walked out the door and took our business elsewhere.   If you're not going to be attentive to the people walking in the door and you're going to be rude, you shouldn't be working the front where that's the first thing people see.   I know from past experiences here, you don't have just one server; your waiter is anyone you can catch the attention of, which isn't very easy unless you're part of a larger group. I think the waiters/waitresses all share their tips and it makes them not care about the service they're giving.",

It tasted like it had too much star anise.   I was adventurous and ordered the bun bo hue. Huge mistake-- again salty broth, the veggies that normally accompanies this disk appeared sad. The offering of frest mint was very stingy. Instead of cabbage, there were pieces of ripped up lettuce. Sure, they may not have red cabbage, but they could have at least cut up the lettuce nicely.",

I came in for lunch with my girlfriend and we got a table fairly quick. The server was quick and always attentive to us with whatever request i.e. more lime, small bowl, and etc.  I order the Pho Tai (Rare Beef) Large and the flavors definitely reminded me of pho from Cali, but the portion felt a bit small still for a large size and the meat quantity was definitely lacking.  My girlfriend ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Grilled Pork Vermicelli with Eggrolls), and again the flavors were reminiscent of home, but the ratio of noodles to veggies were off. Too much veggies and too little noodles. The fish sauce accompanied with it was fantastic though!  All in all, the service was great and the food tasted great as well, however the quantities and ratio can be improved upon leading to my 4 stars for super service.",

(I paid $20 for a bowl of pho inside the hotel on the strip once...)  Anyway, parking is easy.  There's a Lee's Sandwiches next door and Meet Fresh across the street.  I'm excited about the 7 Leaves coming soon!  I ordered the egg rolls, which were surprisingly REALLY GOOD.  I usually never eat egg rolls!  The order came with four, and I ate two of them by myself.  I also had a #16 (rare steak and flank) small size, which was more than enough to cure a hangover.  The broth was delicious. They have sauces and bean sprouts ready before the food comes.  This restaurant full of Asian/Vietnamese people also confirms how authentic their food is.    Service was great.  The servers know what they're doing, and they also care about you.  They asked every table how things were going.  I love it!  I'm def coming back on my next Vegas trip!",

It was FULL of lots and lots of bean sprouts. Had spring rolls with same no-flavor meat and shrimp used in spring rolls (I didn't know this beforehand) and it was awful at $6 I wouldn't pay $1 for one. The sauce for the banh xeo was just horrible looked  and tasted like sugar water with a few drops fish sauce. Had to ask for lime and fish sauce and still couldn't eat the partially cooked/uncooked pancake.  Next, the combo pho taste like someone reheated an old bowl of pho. And/or added hot water to the broth. What the hell? Meat was horrible, once again and dry/ tasteless.  Lastly, our waiter forgot my soda to wash this down with. I just asked for it to be left off the bill.   Why didn't I just complain ? You don't want to complain at an Asian place unless you want something \" special \" in return.   Really disappointed. Keep your money, or Go somewhere else.",

Now being that this place is 24/7, I did not expect much from the pho. I ordered the pho tai chin and it was pretty good. The bowl was smaller than most pho places I'm used to in Florida, but I was still full after eating the entire bowl. As far as the broth, it didn't taste as good as most authentic pho places, but I was willing to settle considering there's not many places you can get pho this early.   Overall, the service good and food was good. If you're looking for pho anytime of the day, this is definitely the place to go.",

    "text": "Whoa. This place was seriously a hidden GEM. I will be coming back over and OVER again when we visit Vegas. So here's the story...  We visited Vegas on a chilly and nippy weekend. We had a party of about 13, and we all decided we wanted Pho...or some comfort food along those lines. Our aunt suggested Pho Kim Long, and I'm so happy she did.   Although my original plan was to get Pho, after seeing the menu I was eager to try everything. We ordered egg rolls, crab Rangoon, Terayaki chicken, Pad Thai, orange chicken, etc. The appetizers came out HOT and fresh! We also got an assortment of delicious dipping sauces as well. The Terayaki chicken was fabulous, no complaints....the PAD THAI though...the chicken Pad Thai I will be dreaming about from this moment forward (ok a little dramatic, but still ). The sawwwwce was perfection. Just the right amount of heat and consistency.   The service was GREAT! They accommodated our large party just fine, and we were seated in a timely manner for a busy Friday night. It started getting busy when we left around 830pm.",

I might-not-have-lost the time that I complain about!  DON'T .....waste your time....   Fighting blind .....minded thoughts of food dispair....  HOLD ON!!!!!!, TO YOUR GRUB!  You gotta' hold on....   HOLD ON!!!!!!, TO  YOUR GRUB uh, hoooh!\" _____________  ^ ^ ^  Yazzzzzzzz!  Nothing like a classic En Vogue single -remixed, to take us swiftly into \"Hump Deezy\"......  Ladies (and gentle-gays),   Throughout the years many methods have been derived upon to assist you in holding on to your man....  Erecting upon Spring (roll) Mountain within Las Vegas' Chinatown precinct, this \"runaway love\" of a Vermicelli bazaar - open TWINNIE-PHO seven - offers a satiating taste of Ho Chi Minh City; enough to satisfy each and every palette!  (Yo Mama'z a ho)  In light of such, I've derived upon a few small practices to better ensure healthy eating and a nonetheless happy household.   Flashback:  Does anyone else recall dating within the 90's???  Ahhhhhh.   Life was so darned simple when you knew in advance that he was 'neva gonna' get it! Lol.   We didn't have all of the confusing apps to be catfished from and for the most part, minus a few 'Divorce Court' episodes, what you saw was what you could at least expect to get.        I. This place Yelp, is hardly any exception as menu items range from spring rolls to hot & sour soup, crab rangoon, chicken lettuce wraps.....Pho (of course) and the list goes on and on like Donkey Kong!             Each item actually looks BETTER than its picture and this is probably the ONLY occasion that you won't have to request a Facetime or Skype session just to establish peace of mind prior to reluctantly consenting to meet for that first blind date!            ALLLL this \"grub\" ^ is waiting for you......and hit us up for no more than $60.00 total; a steal, if you ask me!!!!  Ladies, similar to that \"one special time\" when your man actually courted you, anticipate wait times here mirroring ANY bar BEFORE last call.         II. If it's any consolation just \"free your mind\" and know that troubles don't last always~  Similar to flipping through a rolodex, contact list or black book, names here are called once and ONLY once at a barely audible level prior to moving on to the the next one...         III. Failure to \"listen up\" will UNDOUBTEDLY lead you to be just as alone as a fart lingering within the wind.    Much like a wedding ring do great things come to those that wait.          IV. The reward here is simple. EXCELLENT food served at \"Luxor\" fast speed!            We weren't seated any longer than 2 minutes before receiving our beverage requests and shortly thereafter were we presented our appetizers followed by piping hot entrees all within a completely packed house!  {{--A healthy wedding reception almost always solidifies that the bridal registry has been adhered to closely.--}}  Studies have confirmed that commitment issues and infidelity seem to be the \"new norm\" within many millennial partnerships.   #LIES!!! ^           V. This is NOT the time to implement any such fidelity.              Sample y'all.... Sew those oats and SAMPLE IT ALLLLL!!!! Portions here are HUGE and your meal will be too darned good to even think about sharing with your kids later on! Besides.... they probably won't appreciate the savory goodness that is this place anyway!  Relationship longevity, as I see it, is relative to maintaining an open line of communication and the establishment of ground beef...... I mean,  GROUND RULES!          VI. Understand that the QUICKEST way to your man's heart is undoubtedly THROUGH HIS STOMACH. It's like having Fast Trak on the 15 freeway traveling ONE WAY directly to his love handles!!!           Keep him full. \"Give him something he can feel\"!!!          Live,... love,.... and prosper.   Feel free to print this as necessary, however and when in doubt, daters/diners are urged to reevaluate and familiarize themselves to capacity with rules 1-6.   *** From buying him gifts to taking him on trips, whatever your strategy, please heed Kenny Ken's advice and remember that NO RELATIONSHIP is secure should you neglect to seal the deal and:                              FUK HIM LONG!  Oops. Dayum this autocorrect! That was supposed to say, \"Pho Kim Long\".  #give- it- up- turn- it-loose . . . . . .  (I also do premarital counseling and couples therapy and more importantly, like a \"rocket \", I'll be here all week)",

The meat portion was okay. Order extra meat ball for extra cost.  Felt like we were rush to order, eat and leave.",

I got the combination which was recommended to me by the waitor, and it didn't disappoint. The main thing that stands out about the pho is the meat. The combination has several different types - meatballs, brisket, steak.. all of them tasty and good quality. It didn't seem as sketch as some of the other places I been to where u don't know what type or where they even got the meat.   Service was friendly and decently fast. Come check this place out!",

    "text": "Went here on New Years Eve and boy was that a huge mistake. Wait time was roughly around 40 minutes which wasn't too bad.   The food was decent.  But Westminster and Garden Grove have way better vietnamese food. The only reason I came here was the fact that it was open late and I was hungry for rice and pho. If there was a different resturant open I would have gone there instead.   Food Ordered: Pho with brisket & rare steak  8/10 Pad Thai 7/10  Rice 5/10 ( the only reason why it was a 5 was because the rice was hard) and it took us forever to get.  Only complaint is that the staff was unattentitve. Our server was all over the place, only saw him when he took our order and then he was gone the rest of the night. He didn't even bother checking to see if we had got all our food, he never checked to see if we got water, he never even came back with the check. Waited over 15 minutes for my rice, so instead I had to go up to the counter to get my rice. We didnt even bother waiting for someone to give us our check because service was so bad.Instead we went up to the counter to pay.  Overall experience:  If you have patience then by all means come here, because you'll be waiting forever.",

    "text": "We normally make a stop in Chinatown every time we come..this was no exception.  We normally would order Pho but its 115 degrees outside, we just ended our 8 hour road trip back from Idaho and we are starved!  It was 1000pm and Chinatown in Las Vegas is always open!  Thank God ...so was Pho Kim Long.  You signed in and the waiter said about 45 minutes wait...it was only about 15.  We were seated and our waiter not the warmest individual (but it's ok we were warmed up from the weather outside).  Anyway we were given water, ordered our food..it probably took another 20 minutes or so...then silence!  All you heard was chewing..we ordered spring rolls & crab rangoon for appetizers.  The spring rolls were great, but rangoon was exceptionally light and crispy....delicious!  Then the real food came..walnut shrimp, crispy house noodles, salt & pepper pork chops, beef with eggplant stir fry, and garlic ong choy, and roast duck.  Our entire table was well fed ..that was for sure!  The food was very tasty and flavorful.  As a matter of fact this was the first time we ever ordered family style dishes.  We were certainly pleased.  So my take on this restaurant if your looking for quick service and good food..maybe not so bubbly waiter (although he was very cognizant of the empty water glasses that he continued to fill up - which made up for any shortcomings).   Definitely recommended!",

Our last visit, we actually ordered other items on top of pho and it was surprisingly pretty good. The consistency of the pho broth can be hit and miss, therefore the lower rating.

All dishes were excellent and prices were more than fair for Las Vegas.   Big plus - my brother's pho came about 10 minutes after ours and the manager (I'm assuming he's the manager, young Asian guy) approached us to apologize. Great customer service and we really didn't think anything of it since it was Christmas eve after all and so many people. I would like to think these people really care about the customer. You read so many horror stories and bad experiences at restaurants during the holidays. We were glad this place was the opposite.",

The only down side is it gets really packed so most times you have to wait a little bit to be seated or it can be a little difficult to get your servers attention. However, tonight John is our server and he has been extremely kind and attentive. My favorite dishes are are the lettuce chicken wrap, orange chicken, fried rice, and Sweet and sour. There's a big menu with a lot to choose from. If you have a sweet tooth, be sure to try the Taro with Boba, another one of my faves!   I wouldn't recommend coming here for a date night, as it gets a bit loud but it's def. fun hanging out in groups here. It's also a bit messy looking at times but that's only because there are so many people coming in and out that it's difficult to keep up!   Great spot where are the locals come for after hour noms.",

I happened to wait outside for only 30 minutes, but on one GLORIOUS 118 degree afternoon, sweat drippin down my spine and all! (sarcasm)  Unfortunately, we were seated in a corner near the bathrooms where we were easily forgotten by our moody waitress. The time it took to track her down to finally order did award me the opportunity to view the beautiful interior decorations though; lots of faux wooded pieces, tree and plant life!    I did finally go with *#23, vermicelli with charbroiled pork & egg roll* for $9.95. This comes with a giant bowl of fish sauce with no shredded carrots or daikon. Bowl of noodles I did eventually receive was actually rather large, but somewhat deceivingly. Mine had a decent amount of meat and sliced up egg roll with crushed nuts and chopped scallions on top, but there wasn't much noodle. Just a bunch of shredded cabbage underneath. The actual presence of vermicelli noodle in a bun is rather important to me. Thai tea for $3.50 also a bit 'meh', but welcoming on a hot day of death.",

Not once did he say one word to me. He slid my card across the counter and put the paper and pin down for me to sign. As I was standing near the front door there was another postmates driver waiting for their pickup. When her food was ready he simply walked over handed it to her she said thank you he didn't say anything. About 15 minutes later my order was ready. He just yelled across the restaurant postmates! I walked up and noticed there were two bags. My customer only ordered 3 items (small) so I pulled out the receipt to verify the two bags are for me. ( I didn't wanna walk away with more than what was paid for or with the wrong order for my customer) I asked him is this order match the order I placed? And was trying to show him my phone and receipt because the food names didn't match the receipt. He said you read it to me right? I said yes I did. I am just trying to make sure I am giving the customer what they ordered because the food names don't match the receipt and the food I ordered. I'm just making sure this is the correct receipt. (If your unaware postmates drivers sometimes have to order and pay for the food with a prepaid card. Then we have to take a picture of the receipt and the dollar amount.) this is why I was making sure I got the correct receipt and order. He put a thumbs up and rolled his eyes. So I walked over and checked the order. The customer asked for extra sauce. However it wasn't in the bag. So I said excuse me can I get an extra sauce. He ignored me and walked away.... flat out ignorant. I never been treated like that! Maybe he shouldn't be in the service business if he doesn't like to deal with people...",

I always get the vegan pho it has a lot of veggies and the broth doesn't have a weird after taste like a lot of vegan pho's do. Also a note to my vegan friends the egg rolls are made out of chicken which I they did not mention to me so definitely watch out for that. Overall I love this place and I always come back.",

The Pho is delicious per usual but the fried egg rolls and the Singapore noodles with the pork and shrimp are the best ones on the menu without a doubt. Definitely a great spot to have late munchies with friends",

The broth was very flavorful and not too salty. This dish only comes in a large but I finished the whole thing because it was that good! They were very generous with the portion of meat. This is one of the top pho places I've had. However, I was a little disappointed after not finding any tripe in my bowl.   My boyfriend got the Bun bo hue and it was very different from the other BBH I've had before. It wasn't spicy and almost kind of bland. We also got fresh spring rolls to share, but these were also disappointing. They were on the soggy side and fell apart after the first bite.  I recommend the special combo pho! Especially after a long night of drinking. I felt brand new after leaving this place :)",

She should have told me that before she took them to the table . That was so unprofessional and the excuse was so ridiculous.

Service was good - everyone was friendly and the food came out surprisingly fast, considering there were a few parties waiting to be seated when we got there.   Like the majority of soups ( or food? in my opinion), they are what you make of them. There's only so much a chef can do to the food until it's up to you to make it exactly what you want it to be. You like kick-in-the-gut spicy? You add it. You like punch-to-the-face sour? You do it LOL. So, after jalapenos, half a bottle of Sriracha, some weird dark purple sauce my GF convinced me was plum sauce (prune sauce?), four limes, and chili paste later, my soup was perfect haha. Not that it wasn't good on it's own because it completely was, but I added my own flare and this Mexican likes ~fuego~.  I guess my only \"complaints\" (for lack of a better word) are..  1. more napkins, please. one is not enough. 2. the shrimp rolls in that kinda see-through, jelly-like wrapping were SO sticky that I had to cut one off the plate LOL.  Other than that, I'll be back.",

The pho order usually comes very quick. The last time I was there, it took forever to bring out the rice plate. And they have excellent che 3 mau (3 colors desert). The price was a bit pricy comparing to Cali standards. About 10-11 bucks for a bowl of pho and 4.50 for the Che. There were a couple things that kinda bothered me, first, most of the waiters and waitresses, they're not fluent in English so there usually is some sort of miscommunication. Second, I was eating my rice plate the last time, several of the staff were kinda staring at me the whole time. I was feeling uncomfortable a bit. But I think it's just an Asian cultural thing or I stood out very obvious as a Tourist from the strip lol. Anyway, i left them a good tip. This place is cool, you can always eat pho and get a smoothie bobba at LEES next door. 4 stars.",

Menu could be better just because you have to order everything separate and the quantity is not alot for the price. We consumed 70.00 worth of food and it was four people in our party. The waitress came to our table twice.. once to take our order and second to bring out our food. When done  my husband only had a few dollars change and left to go pay at the cashier while i sat behind packing up our leftovers. While i was doing that a waiter stopped by the table i assumed he was going to start cleaning but quickly left after picking up a plate. Well i was wrong he communicated with the cashier and let him know only a 2dollar tip was left. Like i mentioned we only had 2dollar change and were going to leave a few more dollars. The cashier was rude and demanded my husband to leave a 15% tip. We always leave tips to our waiters off course the bigger the party the larger the tip but it also counts if you where satisfied with your service and to us for the two times she helped us was not worth 10 extra dollars. Be nice to your customers and maybe tell your waiters to be more attentive and they might get the tip they deserve.",

Where is the calamari? After one bite I knew I just threw $13 down the drain. Hopefully they take it out of the menu before they piss off other customers...... With that being said, I still give them 4 stars for the hard working waitress there.",

The Pho here or broth I should say could use a little bit more flavor and be hotter. Most times I've been here that's the most common problem. I'm not sure if it's because this place is open 24/7 and they just don't seem to make a new batch or something. They carry a lot more than Pho though, but for a restaurant named \"Pho Kim Long\" they should have really good Pho. The pork rice dishes and fry rice is good as well. There are a variety of drinks on the menu as well.",

I have a lot of respect for the spices and \"complexity\" the flavors bring to ones taste-buds! Hence, this is definitely on my top 5 places for pho/Viet restaurants. This time, I ordered the Bo Kho (Beef Stew) and it was outstanding. The soup consistency was perfect and full, and I was extremely satisfied. I cannot wait to get the chance to come here again.",

    "text": "I've been coming here since there was smoking allowed in restaurants many years ago I just barely Yelp and for a 24/HR Asian joint the food isn't too bad, it's good but the service is a hit or miss as well as time when ordered to table.  There have been many incidents but this last one bothered me a lot.  Usually me being the foodie, I order the food... My daughter had to use the restroom and I didn't expect my BF to order but he did and mistakenly ordered beef pad thai instead of chicken.   Nothing allergic, just a preference... I'm usually not picky and I am behaved until treated with disrespect that I know I didn't deserve...  My daughter and I weren't in the bathroom long because as soon as we got out and walked back to the table the server was leaving our table from taking the order. I flagged down the closest staff member to correct the order and this guy gets mad. Pissed off to be exact, a highly unexpected attitude. I thought maybe... 'He's just having one of those days...'  Now, for starters, I'm in the culinary industry for a living and I know how the kitchen works, hospitality and understand how irritable it would be to have to change an order once it's already rung in and we started cooking it... We literally just took the order and the place was decently busy...   In the politest way possible I asked: \"Excuse me? If it's possible to change the pad thai to chicken instead of beef. We ordered beef by accident\"   he said \"chicken pad thai?! you ordered beef pad thai\" Me: \"I understand if it's too late to change that's fine\" He points his finger at me as he said something angrily to where I didn't understand him because he was walking away and hits the wall... The people next to us on BOTH sides of us heard the whole conversation.   He literally points, walks away, smacks the wall as he turns the corner and comes back and tells me \"it's too late to change, you ordered beef and it's already ready\"  Just watching him, his attitude and how fast we ordered, him walking to the kitchen to check and come back telling us our food is ready before our appetizers, I knew he was BS-ing... I then asked him \"if it's already ready, how come you didn't bring it out?\"  He walked away saying that we had to wait... I found the guy that ordered our food and asked nicely if it's too late to change it.   Our server said \"yea that's ok, I just put the order in not too long ago... I'll go change it real quick before it is made\" As I was talking to the waiter, the other staff member who was rude to us, saw us talking to the server and came and started another scene, one which wasn't needed, I didn't mention the other server until he started the scene. He started yelling saying our food was ready and that we ordered beef. Luckily our server was very calm and spoke to him even though I didn't know what he was saying, I felt VERY uncomfortable not understanding what they're saying and him pointing his hand towards my BF and making my BF upset.   Our server apologized for the fellow coworker but found it wrong for someone else apologizing for someone else's doings.   I believe PKL is a bit overrated and lacks consistency. I don't know what kind of service I will walk into when I come here but like I said, for a 24/HR spot the food isn't too bad.",

Nothing is better for sobering up / morning hangover meal than a tasty bowl of Vietnamese beef noodle soup with numerous types of meat and warm, filling, life renewing bone broth. Yes please.  Service and decor are excellent, food comes quick, it's fresh, hot and has tons of flavor. Throw in some lime and all your clubbing / late night shenanigan issues go away with only the fun memories of a wild night (hopefully).  They also serve coronas and other drinks for $4 and have tons of things on the menu, but i've been here 5 times, always for beef pho dac biet (special). Get it to cure all your issues.

Usually I am pretty sensitive to msg and get super thirsty for the next couple of hours whenever I consume some. But I did not get that with this place!! So don't fear, go on and drink that soup buddy. I got the Beef Ball Pho and was satisfied with their beef balls! (haha) They gave a pretty good amount and it did not taste artificial or sketch.  I was about to drive 4-5 hours back home right after the meal and decided to take the rest of my iced water by pouring it into my water bottle (lol no shame). One of the female servers walked by and actually not only offered to fill up my water bottle but also gave my friend a to-go water cup! She practically saved my life. The wait can definitely get super long around lunch time. I came at 11:30am on a Sunday and waited for around 15 minutes for a party of 7. But the wait got pretty bad after we were seated.",

I like spicy so I loaded it with Siracha, herbs, and more spices to meet my desired heat/taste. My nose was runnier than the day after a night on the strip with Charlie Sheen. It hurt so good!

    "text": "Just a quick update as I have been there about three times in the past three months!  a. Parking - No longer easy. The plethora of good / decent places to go like Lee's Sandwich, Fat Dumpling, Mr. Tofu and etc make parking here limited and in high demand. It is nearly difficult to find any parking here, even if you are willing to walk.  b.  Reasons - That is because PKL is open 24 hours!  The food is darn decent at times.    c.  Late meals - Finished a movie and midnight and came here for noodles on Friday night. At 1:00 am, the place was packed.  Our team waited only ten minutes for a table in the back room, where it says \" Employees only\"  Looks to be a room that they will slowly expand into and perhaps was another restaurant before?    d.  Pho - Had Number 13, which has everything in it and also the Bun Bo Hue with Pho noodles instead of rice noodles (vermicelli).  OK, don't hate that!  I know it is traditional to have BBH with the rice noodles. It is just that the consistency of the Pho noodles is soooooo much better and the texture is amazing. The way the noodles drape over your chopsticks as you shovel a huge portion into your mouth is just what the doctor ordered.  Hard to do with the rice noodles as it is bigger and the consistency is such that you cannot pack a bunch into  your mouth.  Hey it is part of the noodle experience if you ask me.  Just watch any movie where you watch the Japanese salary-men at lunch slurping down a bowl of ramen and I think you will get my drift.  Noodles are meant to be hoovered!    e.  Pho Part II - Anyway, the Bun Bo Hue at 1:00 am is a very, very good. The broth is just right, they serve the spice separately so you can make the soup as hot as you want.  They serve all the bits of tendon, offal, pork hock and everything you can imagine that was eaten in the city of Hue due to well, the poor economy.  I finally learned that offal is the stuff in meats that you cook that most people don't eat.  The offal is awfully good!!! It is what makes the soup.  My son had number 13 which is nearly like BBH without the pork hock and the spice. He slurped that up, but I won because my BBH came first and I had a head start!  f.  The Chicken - Yep, ordered once again the Salted Baked Chicken with Ginger sauce.  Why?  Because it is so good, nutritious and a very good measure of the chef and the restaurant.  Simple to cook, yet easy to over cook, the meat has to be so juicy and tender. It is either that or overcooked as the entire taste is from the chicken itself.  It has to be on the bone, and it has to make you caveman like to use your hands to gnaw at every morsel of meat on the bone!  The ginger onion sauce has to be so good that you are putting it on the chicken like you would butter and you have to ask for more.  This time, the chicken was great.  I went there two weeks ago at 8:00 am and it was absolutely horrible.   So, I think that the chefs know at 1:00 am they will have a ton, so they are making it and storing it just right. At 8:00 am, the last time, I probably had a heated up stored chicken and it was as if \"I made it myself.  just mehhhh\".  Fresh and hot is best and it was rocking at 1:00 am.  Overall, great menu, many of other choices on there that you would find in a Chinese restaurant and a great place to end up!  Now they serve brown rice for 1.50 more.  This Chinese people are so good at making money on rice!  Here is the dealio though. At 1:00 am most of the people there are drunk or buzzed and needing greasy fatty foods to recover. I don't think they are so worried about brown rice....   GK says, this is the late nite place to BE for sure!",

I was very mindblown. They came by to refill water once or twice, gave us an excess of lemons when we asked for more lol .  Food: definitely the best.pho.ever. A very big bowl contains not that much noodles and beef. But I very much enjoyed the warm comfort food at 1AM in the cold dessert weather after clubbing. MMM MMM MMM. Prices are a little jacked up.... but we have to deal because there aren't that many pho places close to the Strip that are open late-nights. Very FRESH and clean bean sprouts. I was very impressed! All the legit leaves were there too!  We paid and were about to leave. DUN DUN. Ice and Coco for E's Ice Loves Coco came in. THEY EAT PHO?!?! Mindblown part 2.

The service is quick when you need something and then non-existant after you've received that something, which I find appealing because my dining culture revolves around talking and enjoying the company of my party while eating/drinking. We had the spring rolls, the egg rolls, and the Rare Steak Pho. They were all delicious! I had never tried the spring rolls which from my recollection are shrimp and chicken with veggies wrapped in a rice paper and paired with peanut sauce. It is chewy (almost like mochi) but with the fresh taste of shrimp really juxtaposed to the sharp peanuty flavor in the sauce I would highly recommend it. The broth for the pho is beefy, hearty, and will really warm your soul! I got the small and as it was my first time I didn't add any of the condiments that come on the side so I could just enjoy the flavors. I will definitely visit this place again!",

After the first bowl of pho arrive it took 20 mins for half of my orders to arrive and the waiter told us the rest of the order will arrive very soon, 20 mins later we asked about the orders again and turns out they never send the order at the first place even they double checked with us at the beginning. When the rest of the order arrive the waiter was very rude that he just shoved it on the table.",

Our server was fine but her manager Lam (or Lamb?) was a nasty person. I heard him speak so negative to our server using profanity for something that was his fault. A customer should never hear that nor should an employee be crying because of bad management. I hope the establishment takes note because we go there often in large groups but it's not worth someone suffering  over. I hope this guy gets what he deserves. As a business owner I can say he would have been let go a long time ago for his attitude and bad work ethic.",

We came Saturday at 12pm and it was a 10 minute wait, not bad at all. I got the rice plate with pork and egg rolls. But the wait to get our food took forever! I was staaaarving. I think it was because they mixed up our order with another table. But our meal was satisfying and good. Wish they gave more meat but it was cool. My total came out to $12ish (included tip) and we paid at the register. If you're a tourist and need a ride back to the strip, I suggest calling for a cab right before you finish your meal because we had to wait 30 minutes after for ours to arrive.   Plan to come back to get my pho fix after a night out in Vegas!",

I've been eating here for years, and there has been a steady decline in customer service. We hadn't visited for several months because the restaurant had become so popular that wait times were too long. Last night (Friday) at 7 pm, more than half of the tables were available. Yet, our server kept rushing to and from our table without so much as eye contact. And I noticed all of the other servers treating the other patrons the same way.  We ordered our favorite app, calamari. It was so over-breaded it was almost comical. A lot of the bites I took didn't even have squid in it.  But onto the main event. The pho is still the best in town. The flavors in the broth are deep and intense. The noodles are comforting. The rare steak and brisket are tender. It's enough to keep me coming back even though the service is not great.",

Since the first review I have been back many times and everything has been consistent. They are always fairly quick everything is completely fresh.

It's a pretty big restaurant so it can accommodate your group of friends or if you just want to go yourself. We came with a group of about 20 and were seated in the back.   The reason for 3 stars is that although they're open 24 hours (which is amazing), their food is okay. It was mediocre compared to the food I've had in LA and D.C. Where I'm from. I ordered the crispy noodle special that came with an assortment of meats and seafood. And I ordered calamari as my starter. The calamari was good with a nice crisp, I could definitely tell there was msg in it though. As for the crispy noodle, it was a small portion for the price I paid. Others who ordered pho waited a long time for their meals to come out. They got it after mine. I would think that pho would come out first, either way the folks who had the pho said it was not bad. But either because we were all hungover or just hungry.   I'll still come back though because of the convenience of it being open all the time. And I love Asian food!",

    "text": "Hands down, best late night post clubbing eats in town. After a night out, nothing helps sober you up like some 24 hour Vietnamese food! Depending on the day/time, there can be a bit of a wait. But I have been here a couple of dozen times and can honestly say: big venue, lots of tables, quick service, consistently good food.  TO START: Get the GOI CUON (SPRING ROLLS). Comes with four shrimp/pork/lettuce filled cold spring rolls with peanut sauce that is literally crack. Their recipe for it is so perfected, I can literally just eat it with a spoon. Also go for the CRAB RANGOONS. Eight perfectly fried wontons filled with cream cheese & crab, paired with sweet n' sour sauce.   FOR HER: I ordered the SHRIMP PAD THAI once when I wasn't in the mood for pho... and was mind blown! Seriously the best pad thai I have ever had. Yes, at a Vietnamese place! How? I don't know. But it's so filled with flavor & perfectly seasoned & lots of noodles... I can never finish it on my own, meaning leftovers for later! Try the combination for a mixture of shrimp, beef & chicken too. Delish!  FOR HIM: This place has great (and cheap!) pho. He always orders the RARE STEAK & WELL DONE FLANK NOODLE SOUP. Cheaply priced, a generous amount of soup, noodles & meat... with a side of sprouts, jalapenos and all that good stuff to add as you please. More than enough to share with someone too! Add a little hoisin sauce, maybe a little sriracha for a kick. So good! The ORANGE CHICKEN is also a fave!  Only bad thing I can say? They don't have any lemon for your water... I think I'll survive though.",

    "text": "Such a madhouse, OK food but just avoid unless you have a lot of patience and like bad service.   Parking is so bad at this complex so you need to luck.  They said 30 minute wait but when we checked the list less than 15 minutes later we were crossed off. We were standing right there outside but they didn't call our name?  Because people are worried they'll lose their spot, the waiting line inside was so packed. I had several hovering right behind me while I ate! I couldn't believe it! Don't let them seat you by the door.  They have so many easy ways to increase the waiting area, move the huge fish tank (with no fish in it anyway) and move the other huge table not being used at all, so big that it could hold another fish tank, and they'd instantly have twice as much space. Instead tiny waiting area leaving random people standing 10 inches behind my chair as I ate.  Service is unreal bad. I've been here 5 times and they never ask if you want drinks. Shows the owner doesn't care or doesn't like making money. The just drop off water and food and run away. There is just endless room to improve service but they want you in and out.   Food is good but not great on some dishes. Pho seems kinda bland and not very impressive. Pork chops looked good but were very thin and small with lots of fat; chops came with way too much rice in portion to meat, took two huge bites of rice per tiny bite of chop.   Another huge turn off and maybe scam that other reviews mention and that I noticed on my last visit is that when you pay with a card first get asked 'how much do you wanna tip' and they stand there while you and your group then decide while he's hovering over you. So rude! What's worse is that bring back the receipt to sign and you can leave tip again if not paying attention. The group should not feel pressured during payment. The only time the waiter should come and leave quick they don't but rush away every other time lol.   After coming here many times over the last 5+ years I can promise this place will not change or try to improve. Could easily read these reviews and make changes but I'll get out goes unseen.   I'll be back and hope to update. I live close and like many of the food dishes and give them 4 star, but overall 2 stars is fair.   Hope this helps. Enjoy!",

This is totally a tourist place so weekend be prepare to wait. Lunch time is crazy and there isn't a lot of parking space so car pool if you can. Also has other restaurant to eat around the same plaza fyi  Bowl of pho runs about 8-9$ and they have other Chinese and Vietnamese plates if you don't want pho. Service is decent especially in such a busy establishment. If you have a part of 4 or less you don't have to wait but a bigger party has a bit of a longer wait since you want to get a bigger round table.  Also a perk? Totally 24 hours. Go have fun at a Vegas night and then uber or lyft your way to get over your future hangover!",

The wait was longer than I would have liked but at 20 minutes it wasn't too terrible. I ordered two items, fried calamari and the special combo pho. The pho was good and had I only had that I would give this place a four star rating. However, I also ordered the fried calamari and that was pretty bad. The squid itself was overcooked and the seasoning was very bland earning that plate two stars.. Overall, I would go again if I was in Vegas and it was late, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go.  FYI the service is a bit rude and hurried.",

Keep in mind that we are both from Orange County where the pho is probably better than in Vietnam's.  There was a 10 minute wait and the restaurant was packed and busy.  You gotta love the bouncer looking dude who signs you in to be seated.  Chatted with a few drunks and finally got seated at a thankfully corner table away from most people.  My girlfriend went for their hot and sour soup and I went for a pho bo vien.  My girlfriend's hot and sour soup came out in a huge bowl and was very good.  It was perfectly season, flavored, and full of ingredients.  My pho was good but the bo vien (meatballs) took me off guard.  They were very soft compared to ones I am used to.  It gave it a weird texture.  Overall though it was decent.  It's about $8 for a bowl of pho here.  I liked that they had plenty of other items on the menu besides pho.  Service was basically like any other Vietnamese restaurants.  The inside is large and nothing fancy.  However, it's one of your only few options for pho late in the night.",

Food is average, prices are reasonable, decor has gotten better, and service & cleanliness are just okay. Every time I get a rice vermicelli dish, I always have to ask for extra sauce to add more flavor. I rarely get pho here, but the party I'm with usually has to add hoisin sauce, etc. They're open til late, which is a plus. However, they can get super crowded sometimes.  I go here every now & then, but I still prefer other places to get Pho or Rice Vermicelli dishes.",

Other than that the pho was the best I've tried in Las Vegas so far. Very flavorful and delicious. Maybe a little too much MSG, but I can't complain. Pho tastes so good after a night of drinking.

After tonight's experience, I will never patronize this establishment again. I hope the owner reads this review. Their customer service is some of the worst I've seen, and I've lived here 50 years. Upon walking in, the hostess never greeted me nor anyone else.  There was a waiting list, and apparently you had to write your own name on the list yourself. When my name was called, still no greeting, just \"Follow me\" with a menu in her hand. She drops it on the table and walks away. My server was very nice, but not prompt at all, as I waited for quite a bit of time before he arrived. Although it was busy, all tables were not occupied. I ordered a bowl of Wonton soup and a glass of water. It took forever, and when the runner brought it out, he brought no spoon. Seriously? I tried to hail someone, anyone, to get their attention to get me one, but it was as if I was invisible. I finally had to get up and go get one from the area where the setups were. My server laughed, but did not apologize. The soup was not very hot, and flavor was rather blah. The only other time the server came back was to drop off the check, and I don't remember hearing a \"thank you\" or anything. Then I started getting \"the eye\" when apparently they wanted the table for other customers, although there was no line or waiting list. I took the check to the register.  The guy working it never said hello, asked how my food was, nothing. He didn't say \"That will be $10.01, please.\" Nope.  He never even made eye contact with me at all.  Just said \"$10.01,\" and that was IT!  I paid, and he never said thank you nor made eye contact while handing me my change. He did manage to say \"Where the f**k are you going?l\" to his fellow co-worker, who had just clocked out.  VERY professional. 24 hours or not, don't bother. Go up the street to the west a bit, to Joyful House (not 24 hours).  They have MUCH better service and food, and they actually care about the folks that come in and patronize their establishment.",

I think Viet Noodle Bar has slightly better pho and they also have oxtail pho which is hard to find.  I would also try the pho at district one, as it's a little more flavorful and they have lobster pho and surf and turf (steak and lobster) pho.",

I will say the flavor for the Beijing beef and green beans was good, but the portions have been nearly halved from what they used to be; but the vermicelli bun was literally cold mush and extremely dissatisfying. The romaine lettuce that used to be the bed for the noodles has now been replaced for iceberg lettuce and makes up for about 80% of the overall dish. The noodles were so over cooked that they were a gooey, slimy mess. It's the first time I didn't finish my meal here.",

The vermicelli with pork had good flavors too. The meat had a smokey taste to it. Mapo tofu had the right amount of spice. It doesnt come with rice so you have to order it on the side.

I've been here a handful of times now and I love that this place always has parking in front and the workers always accommodate us and the place is big and clean with a giant fish tank. I always get the seafood Pho and I add tons and tons of lime, jalapeno, cock sauce in mines because I like it spicy. Now I don't eat like Pho but if I have to eat it, I only like the broth and the seafood inside.....there's just something about Pho Kim Long's broth that makes it so addicting. I literally drink the whole bowl of soup and leave all the noodles. Price is right with the amount of food they give and the freshness.   Friends here have also tried and loved their spring rolls, cold noodles and their fried chicken wings.",

If your feeling authentic try the braised catfish clay pot it is excellently full of flavor!

I found this gem after everyone found this amazing place on Yelp, and instead of going to the 2015 Best In Las Vegas pick for 2015, I went here and I am beyond happy.  Now, whenever I am sick, achy, or just in the mood for good food at any time of day or night, I always go here. I sometimes wonder if they ad sick of me coming in so much lol. I always get the Spcial Combination Pho, and the portion of meat is out of this world. I've never seen this amount of beef given to me for Pho!!! And the food is solo good. The broth is amazing.  I even deviated once to try the Won Ton soup, and it was fabulous. The broth was even more amazing, and the won tons themselves were incredible!! Now it's a hard decision between the two, but if I am feeling a bit sick from my chronic illnesses, this is my go to place and it makes everything feel a lot better. My family even jokes that the Pho is my \"medicine.\"  You cannot go wrong here.",

This time, I went around 11:30am and there wasn't a line so we got seated right away. But by 12, there was a huge line out the door. For how packed it was, their service is pretty decent. Not too slow, but not exactly fast either.  We ordered egg rolls and lettuce wraps for appetizer. Both equally delicious and fresh. I got the pho combination and they fill the bowl to the very top. To the point where it's almost spilling. It was so good but I couldn't finish because the bowl was so huge! Overall, a great pho place to check out. And if you're not a huge fan of vietnamese food, just go for the name ;) hehe",

Sure, Pho is the best hangover food you can get, but personally think they're a bit on the pricey side, and their broth isn't that special. They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.  However, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves.   Meh. Also there's always a long line. Unless I really want Pho and I can't wait till I get back to LA, I probably won't come here again.",

    "text": "This is the place to go for some nice Pho noodle soup and classic Vietnamese food! I usually grade Pho noodle shops by a couple of things... First, the flavor and quality of the broth, it can't be too greasy, great deep color of the broth, nor too much MSG. Secondly, the quality of the meat! I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc.   The second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark!   Now, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good!   Service is very prompted, friendly, and professional! Nothing negative to say about it at all!    Price wise, it's great! Everything is pretty much under $10.00! Can't complain too much here!   Enjoy!    n ngon nhe",

Whenever I go to a pho restaurant, I tend to order the same thing - beef flank noodles and fried egg rolls - for a couple of reasons 1) they're the perfect match 2) comparison purposes. I gotta say it was just as good as Pho So 1 by Decatur and Spring Mountain. Service was smooth and speedy. I have yet to know (or so I doubt) that they replace their vermicelli noodles with the yellow egg noodles. till then, i'll rate it 3 stars up for now.",

I got the Pho Tai (pho with thin beef slices), and requested that the beef come on the side so that they weren't cooked well done in the broth by the time I got to them. The broth was really good (above average, I'd say). Ironically I put the slices in the broth a little too late, and my last few pieces wouldn't properly cook because the broth was no longer hot enough. I asked for a little more broth too cook those pieces, and they happily obliged (probably with a chuckle, knowing the amateur mistake I made). This pho tasted better usual; to be fair, it could've been because of the previous night that I had, but it was delicious.  I also recommend ordering a fresh young coconut to drink. They give you a coconut with the top cut off, and with a straw to drink and spoon to scrape off some of the meat. Quite tasty!  One thing I was a little disappointed about was that they added $1 to my meal because I asked for the beef slices on the side. I know some other places do this, but it doesn't mean that it's cool to do so.  Overall, this place really hit the spot and I'd go back.",

We also asked for change so we can all pay the bill separately and they were really rude about that!    There's so many other Thai & Viet restaurants in the same plaza so if I were to go back to Vegas and wanted some authentic Asian food I would not go back to this place.  I'd try another restaurant in the same plaza.

We were there at 9:30am so everything was closed except for this establishment. We took a chance and tried their combination stir fried noodle with veggies, chicken & shrimp and a bowl of soup noodles with the thin flat rice noodles with beef balls, shrimp, calamari, and chicken. Service was a little slow and I got my soup noodles way before hubby got his stir fried noodles. The flavor of the soup was good but a little oily, noodles were soft, and they gave a decent amount of seafood. I enjoyed the stir fried noodles also - the crunchy noodles, meat, and vegetables was covered with gravy.    The place was crowded for a Saturday morning and people seemed to gravitate to this place for their soup noodles. It's lively and the service was friendly but a little on the slow side. Prices were decent: range $7-$10.",

After poppin bottles, dancing for four hours, throwing napkins into the air we were ready to go eat.   I recall going to a pho place on Spring Mtn a few years ago, but this one was different. I think it was Pho Little Saigon and I had broth spilled all over my legs and they gypped us on the bill.  #1 Rule: if you want the Pho Tai Chin order it by it's number. When they bring your order out the pretty much ask Who got #_, #_, #_?! Heck, I don't know what number it was, I just know it has well done brisket and rare steak... LOL but you can't see the meat under all the broth.  Another guy at the table ordered the same thing. He gave me his, but it didn't have the brisket! :( lame sauce.   The pho was alright, for being open 24 hours and having to deal with a bunch of drunkards they do a good job.   Anyhow, we were pretty much sober by 5am and my friend happily dropped us off at our hotel room.

They definitely need to cut back on MSG.   $7.99- Pho Ga (Chicken) $6.99- Pho with Rare Steak $9.99- Shrimp Fried Rice  Overall: I'll come back every night because it is open late, affordable, and satisfying!",

It's worth the cab ride out there but getting back was SO hard...so we're going to do take out next time!!",

We sat down, they took our order after just a few minutes and our food was out.  Props. But, the pho was mediocre. Broth was bland.  The pork chop was under seasoned.  It looked delicious but tasted really bland. The spring rolls were meh.  The fried ones were good. It was also pricey. Probably won't ever come back to this place since there are def better ones around.",

They got the sweetness, liquidity level, and pearl texture perfect. Not to mention the avocados were perfectly ripe.

Also, my order was a tendon and brisket pho in which the tendon served was hard and crunchy. After 30 minutes of sitting, no one even came to check on me to see if I needed anything else.  This place is not how it used to be when I came in the early 2000s.  Don't plan on coming here again since I know of other places open 24 hours.",

Add to that the hilarity of the restaurant name itself, and you'll know how I ended up there with a snickering group of dudes with a late night appetite.  Our table shared the Vietnamese spring rolls as an appetizer, along with a bowl of pho, the pan fried noodle, and the chicken wraps, all of which were really good. The panfried noodle was a good amount, but I would personally have preferred more veggies and the inclusion of something other than the baby bok choy, such as mushrooms and broccoli. The chicken lettuce wraps were good- more chicken than lettuce, but tasty enough that we didn't mind and much better than the other way around.  Service was a little slow but was efficient. Menu is large, and it took a while to make up our minds- unfortunately my first choice order was the crepe, and I was told they were out. I'm not sure how they'd be out of eggs or how that works, but I guess it just means I'll have to come back another time to have it.",

I'm going to guess that its ALWAYS crowded here because its located in a busy plaza in Chinatown near the strip. I've passed by this place a few times during lunch and there's always a bunch of people hanging outside waiting for a table. Parking sucks because the plaza has a lot of shops but not enough parking spots.   Pho is ALWAYS good for a hangover because of the beef/chicken broth, but I felt that Pho Kim Long's broth was very watered down. It seemed (IMO), that they just tossed a few beef bouillon cubes in their broth and added pho seasoning. I ordered a small bowl and it was a good size, but I felt that there wasn't enough meat.There are chopsticks, spoons, spices, and hoisin sauce on the table. While the food came out quickly, and the veggies were fresh, the pho broth and service weren't good. Like most Asian run restaurants, the servers weren't friendly and seemed to always be in a rush.",

There's 8 of us so I understand that it may take a awhile to get seated but the people there lack courtesies and services. They have not come back to us to update us on our table. We basically we have to get their attention and bam we were accommodated. Now move on the the food, overall my friends enjoyed their dishes and so did I. Big portions for reasonable prices. So yes the food aced it but not the workers. Such in a hurry we did not take any food orders. But yummy fooood!",

The staff has a way of making you feel like you're bothering them for whatever you ask for. Waiting for a table has never taken long, but forget getting refills on your drinks or checking on how the food is. Your order is taken, your food is brought out, and good luck finding somebody to bring you the check. You basically have to wave one down like a taxi. Now, their pho can't be knocked, it's fresh, tasty, and always comes out quick. If you're feeling adventurous and try tasting some of the other some 1000 options on the menu, such as pad thai or beef and broccoli (slight wtf, isn't this Vietnamese?) it's a real crap shoot. 50/50 chance of getting something solid tasting. On a lighter note, they have pretty good boba. And nice fish tanks to distract from all the post-club-we're-all-starving-and-still-drunk sloppiness that's going on late night.",

    "text": "Originally, we wanted to eat some Thai Style Noodle House.  To our dismay, they were closing in 10 minutes when we arrived.  So, off we trecked to the next Asian restaurant and landed in Pho Kim Long.  One thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours a day and I was informed that they are the only pho place that has these hours.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  It was my bf, and two of our friends who shared this experience with us.  I never really know what to order from here so I had our friend order for  me.     When the bowl came my way, I was very excited as I'd never had it before.  I believe it was pho with some kind of beef balls.  There were other meats in there but I forgot to ask what type it was.  The broth was good without the extra sauces that people normally put in there.  When adding the bean sprouts, mint, and jalapeno's the kick it gives is a whirlwind of pleasures in your tongue.  My boyfriend ordered the fried rice.  The color was somewhat orangey-yellow.  We've never had anything like it.  Per our friend, the way it's made is the cook adds just the yolk to give it that sunshine color.  It's definitely different but I can't say I'd order it for myself in the future.  The other dish we had was a spicy tofu.  That was really addicting.  Normally, tofu doesn't blend well with anything because of how bland it is.  But, they added the right amount of spice to give it a pleasing taste.  The atmosphere of the whole restaurant was very relaxed.  Most people come here to sober up after a wild night at a club or bar.  It only makes sense.",

Last time I got the vermicilli with meat & eggrolls. It was okay, I had better ones. I didn't like how they put the Americanized bag salad as the veggies in the dish. Then the last weekend I got the rice & pork chops. The pork chops tasted weird, it had this nasty taste after only on the sides and the part with the fat. It was not a good pork dish. ugh. they also put that fake american salad on the side and not like a real lettuce & cucumber like the real pho places in california.  anyways, I heard the pho was good, so come here for pho and not the rice dishes or the vermicilli.",

It didnt bother me that our waitress couldnt bare much English but that was the reason why my order wasnt satisfied. She brought over a chef or manager or whatever guy she brought to the table. I, ever so nicely, told him about my order and he, ever so disrespectfully, denied me and walked away. I've never been so embarassed like this in food service before.

Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay. I finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair. Not just one, but two strands... And maybe more. But I just threw the food away... Blahhh, I'm so disappointed. This is not ok. I tipped too (because I usually always tip) but this is unacceptable!",

I've gotta say, their pork was pretty top notch. Barbecue'd and juicy with a nice fire grilled flavor. Damn!! It definitely was a step above all the other vermicelli bowl's I've had. Everything else in the bowl was pretty standard; comparable to most Vietnamese joints, but the pork was the extra kicker that gave this rating an extra one and a half star. Service was pretty nice too and it was clean inside. Overall pretty nice experience.",

Pho Kim Long (yes, the name turns us all into giggly 12 year olds), was that place for me.    However, on recent visit, I noticed that they have remodeled/redecorated and their prices are really inflated now.  A bowl of pho there used to be like no more than 7 dollars but now, there are bowls of noodles over 10 dollars.  I think they are trying to reach into the non-asian market or something and trying to make it more upscale.  Bah!  Their food is not the greatest, compared to LA standards but it is pretty darn good considering the few choices that you have to select from.    I would have given 5 stats but took 1 away for unconscionable pho prices.",

It was 4 egg rolls for $6 or $7.   The service wasn't too great. It's the service you'd expect from an Asian restaurant. Impersonal and sometimes difficult to get the waiters' attention. They automatically charge a 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more. That's a lot of tip for a small party. And I feel that they don't even do a lot to deserve that much tip. They take your order and serve your food. They don't refill your water automatically and they tend to ignore you if they can!",

I felt like most of them tried really hard to avoid eye contact with their customers...I didn't like the Bun Bo Hue because it tasted kind of weird. Sort of like pho, but spicy... Their portions weren't big either. My bf and my dad had to order an additional rice plate to share and usually they don't need to when it comes to pho. Maybe it was a hit or miss. It was kind of pricey too. Perhaps, we should try another place for pho when we're in town.",

I am very picky when it comes to Vietnamese food and I quite surprised when I came here. It was a little pricey, but the quality of food and the atmosphere made up for it.  My friends and I were greeted and seated immediately  upon arrival. As we were looking through the menu, I was very indecisive about which item to choose. Everything looked so good! I finally came to a decision and ordered the Hu Tieu. I was content with my decision. The bowl it came in looked very small and deceiving, but as I was working my way through the bowl I could not finish it. The broth was very clear and tasty.

Nicely spiced but HEAVY on the garlic which is a good thing i guess. Some of the seasonings were a bit on the heavy side but a swig from a corona fixes that real nice.   Only down side is when we were served the bowls weren't steaming hot they were just warm, but that could be considered a plus cause we didn't burn ourselves.

Way back in January, I'm sitting on this shuttle bus that runs from the convention center to Rio, Palms, and Caesar's. The bus goes over the highway, and I happen to glance out the window at a billboard on my left side. \"Pho Kim Long\", I read, out loud. And proceed to giggle like a little girl. I think to myself, 'Pho King is a clever name, but Pho Kim Long is genius.'  Fast forward to the next day when we were hungry for dinner and not looking forward to the long drive back to LA. We couldn't think of anywhere to eat, and then all of a sudden that billboard flashed in my mind. We all agreed to go to Pho Kim Long, because with a name like that, you've got to at least try it. Sadly, the pho was very lacking in flavor and doesn't really deserve a 2nd try. Still, gotta give props for the name.",

It was all the rave in town, constantly packed and everything about it was great. Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles.   Then, the expansion. It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that.   Maybe I'm just being an elitist, or am still bummed that this place used to be so good. Nonetheless, this place is nothing more than average by far.

She said meeting was not that great.   The appetizer of garlic calamari was pretty good   All in all nice break from expensive spots on the strip",

Even better the late night hours to accommodate the Vegas lifestyle. I have been twice. Like it a whole lot. Fast service. Water always refilled promptly. Nothing to complain about at all. Clean establishment. Friendly professional service. I'm hooked and telling everybody about it!!",

It seems like the staff there just wants to get you in and out.

The first time I went there was a couple of years ago for lunch and it was very good - delicious pho.  Went for dinner with a bunch of friends more recently and the quality was just not there.   I thought it was just okay.  Pho wasn't entirely hot when I got it, which was disappointing. As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now.   Now when I want pho I go down a few doors to Fat Dumpling - great pho with all fresh ingredients, no ridiculously long lines, and better price.",

The smell was making me insane. So good. I loved the sparse simple decor. The line went fast and they have all my fav Vietnamese food on the menu. Fresh rolls with amazing peanut sauce, made me really happy. Deep fried tofu tasted like deep fried butter, which to me is heaven. And the Pho... Yes the pho! Perfect. I will sleep well tonight.

They sat us at a big round table and we had to wait about 20 minutes just to get our orders taken. We got the food pretty fast, but we were completely ignored after that. One of the girls in the group literally had to walk up to one of the workers just so she could order another order of eggrolls since no one was going back to our table. That second order of eggrolls probably took about 30 minutes to get to the table, which made no sense at all considering the first order only took like 5 minutes. After we were all done and waiting there for a longtime for someone to give us our check, we had to go up and ask the cashier for it, so they finally dropped it off at our table. Even after we put the money down on it, we still had to walk up to the cashier to give it to him.  I have no idea wth was up with this place. We were the biggest group there and not one server was attending to us. This place wasn't exactly full either.   Again, the food was okay, but the service was pretty bad.   Will not come again.",

Everything is very fresh and the customer service is great - the food comes out quickly and I never need to ask for a drink refill. My only complaint is that it's always very crowded and the tables are very close together - it leaves me feeling a little bit claustrophobic.  And it's a bit loud, also. Not great of you're looking for a place for conversation, but I absolutely recommend it for a fun night out with friends :)",

    "text": "Pho Kim Long, Vietnamese with a Chinese menu.  I've been to PKL a thousand times. Nine times out of ten, its 4 am and I'm really drunk. They're 24 hours and one of the few affordable restaurants close to the strip. But seriously though, food is supposed to taste better when your drunk, isn't it?  PHO: Sometimes my soup comes a little greasy. On occasion, noodles are under-cooked and I feel like their beef and other fillings could use some improvement. Also, pho is served with \"rare steak.\" So why is my beef tai 100% cooked when it gets to the table?  CHINESE: I came here a lot with someone who didn't like Vietnamese food. He ordered off the Chinese menu because lets face it, who doesn't like Chinese food? The seafood combination pan-fried noodles and the beef stir fry with broccoli are pretty good. Entrees are usually served with steamed rice. The fried rice here is flavorless and not worth the $8. If you like Mapo Tofu, skip the mapo tofu here, it tastes strange!  APPETIZERS: Spring rolls are pretty good. But they're raw and  you drench them in peanut sauce--can't mess those up. Egg Rolls taste good but they're unusually small... For the same price, I can get decent size ones down the street at my favorite pho joint.   CREDIT CARD FRAUD: A day or two after one visit, I realized I never got my card back from the server. When numerous fraudulent charges came up, I had to assume a shady server swiped my card. They ordered things online and sent them to a local address. PAY CASH. Can't trust shady asians.  SERVICE: The service sucks. It's god awful and when you really need water, don't expect them to give it to you on their own. Don't be shy, flag someone down and demand what you need.  Nothing to rave about but not a bad place to eat when your wasted and in desperate need of food.  Don't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)",

We also had the Spring rolls which was just ok. Pho is always based on how good the soup is, and the soup here was not authentic at all. It tasted more like msg mixed with water and it tasted really fake.   It's cool that this place is so close to the strip (driving) and a good place to get some soup if you have a hangover, but as a meal? Neh....",

The customers sitting on 4 tables around us so quiet eating because they  were talking so loud about non-sense shit. They were ruining everyone peaceful breakfast morning.

    "text": "Food portion was disappointing for the price $10 / bowl). And service / attitude was horrible.   Have been here many times over the years. Taste is not bad. Still pretty good. But, everything else is horrible. For those reasons I can't get myself to give them even a 2 star for good taste and thumbs down on everything else. 1 star is what I felt was deserved.   Let's see, where do I start: 1. Was rudely greeted as we walked in. We had an infant with us so I had to roll the stroller and etc. we were following her as close as she would've liked i guess, so she kept hurrying us and waving In a rude way. And by the way, the restaurant was half empty so it wasn't busy.   2. We ordered pho and bun bo hue. This is the saddest part. Just a giant bowl of soup. Each of our bowl had 4 slices of meat, that was so small it was probably shredded from one piece of meat.   3. That wasn't the worst part with our food, that the meat was almost non-existent. Worst part was when we couldn't find the noodles in the giant bowl of soup. We almost called them over that they forgot to put noodles in there before my wife said she found it, the barely 3-4 fully chopstick grip full of noodles. With so little noodles swimming in a giant bowl of soup, it was quite annoying because you only get a few strands with each grab. So annoying.  There are many other great pho restaurants around the area now a days. For cheaper. Skip pho Kim long. This place went to shit.",

    "text": "This place seemed like a decent place my coworker recommended we go to eat after our shift. We arrive and the waiter came to drop off waters and hurried away from our table, without saying nothing. Didn't bother us until we got to order food and he seemed to want nothing but to leave our table ASAP. We thought it was strange but didn't bat an eye. Didn't see him again until he dropped off our food. No one came to check on our drinks or ask how was the food, which I though was odd as it's almost customary for a waiter/server to do for any table. Still yet we weren't too thrilled about the service. After finishing our food he came back again and silently gave us the check and ran off again. Once we got to the cashier to pay for our food they almost seemed to insist that we left no less than a 20% tip. My coworkers weren't happy with the service but I understand sometimes people have their bad days so I paid the 15% tip on my part of the bill even though the cashier circled the 20-30% tip part on the receipt and pointed it out to me. For me that really irritated me once I only left tip for my part of the check but that wasn't what totally left me in disgust. After seeing what I tipped which was $3 on a $20 bill with bad service THE CASHIER SCOFFED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AT ME. I took back my receipt and scratched off my tip part. I gave the bad service a few passes but that was the final straw. I get people have their off days that's why I still decided to tip despite the subpar service but you want to shake my head at me after not tipping the crazy amount you WANT vs what you DESERVED? I rate the food 7/10 but if you come eat here PLEASE don't tip unless you get a fantastic waiter who knows how to do their job and please their guest and knows how to do the BARE MINIMUM. As far as the restaurant is concerned check your staff cause most of them can't do the bare minimum and expect some $100 tip HA",

Then portions are fairly small and not worth the amount you pay for. After eating here and getting ready to pay for our check we still leave a tip for the lack of service we got, we left $6 for a $30 check. When we get to the register the cashier demands we leave at least a $10 tip. Never have I had such poor service and a demand for a bigger tip. Not worth the waste of time and money.

The best thing I could say about the place was how fast I was sat and how attentive the servers were with filling my water. That's always a hot button for me at restaurants. How attentive servers are to my table. That's one of the signs of great service for me. The small details count.  I ordered the shrimp spring rolls. Sauce was very congealed. The noodles inside melded into one thick strand that was not very  appetizing or pleasing but had to eat because 1. I was hungry and 2. I didn't want it to go to waste.   The pho I ordered was good. Not the best.  The most off putting thing to me was at the very end. I went to the bathroom and it was trashed. The garbage was over filled with used paper towels. Seems like someone forgot to do their cleaning duties that night. Just because it was late night doesn't mean the employees should slack on their duties.",

I went here for dinner on a week day with my mom who was visiting. Servers are rude and totally do not accomodate to what you want to order. My mom wanted this seafood soup which came with vermicelli noodles, she just asked if she can have half vermicelli and half yellow noodle and the server said NO. Flat out NO they don't do that there. Their bean sprouts looked old and were soggy.  I don't think I will ever come back.",

    "text": "So anyone in Vegas understands this is a perfect spot for late nights. Do not go there on a Thursday night. I just had definitely one of the worst experiences there.   You can tell how they divided the tables and one side were the drunk leftovers from the club. The smaller side were just regular people ready to dine. I went there after picking my girlfriends mom up from her late swing shift. We get there around 4 AM. No crowd but the security guard actually seats us which was fine.   We sit down and were given menus. My girlfriends mom waves to her coworker that also just got off work. We were finally given some water and looking at the menu and after about 10 minutes we are finally asked if we're ready and sadly we weren't. So he said \"Okay\" no customer service with a take your time yadiyadiya... just left. Then comes this solo diner that sits next to us. After about 5 minutes of him waiting he was upset and walked over to the security guard. Security guards asked if he would like to start with appetizers. Guy replies \"no I just want to order, number 13\" blam.  Done deal. He places the order and security guard comes back to us asking if We'd like \"fast\" appetizers and sorry for the wait because they're back up... which is believable but.. I know for a fact they weren't. The same guys that were ready to take our order saw us. We figured okay maybe they think we're still pondering our great options at pho kim long. No we want pho homie. It's simple. Surpringly our spring rolls came out just minutes after ordering. At the same time our solo diner already had his food but tells the server \"you guys forgot my drink and napkin\".. they didn't apologize because they knew they didn't want to serve him as it seemed he was a \"regular\"  We sat there with our empty plates and half empty glasses of water. The guy who supposedly wanted to take our order then starts to clean up the table that was next to ours and the girlfriends mothers coworkers said a peep and he walked over, placed there order. Right after that the solo diner was done he paid and left. Before we even had a chance to order. The guy cleans up and another guy basically asked how much and he said zero. And the employees seemed a bit off.  Now everything was cool it seemed fine until after our meal. Sure I can understand horrible service for people who always have to deal with drunk leftovers from the club... but you sat us on a side with regular people just waiting to dine. We asked for a to go box and the check. I work in the tipping industry and understand we should tip. At least. As for restaurant tipping I truly believe that is based on the customer service we received.. I felt like we didn't get any.. so do they deserve any? Sure. I gave them 3 dollars. I felt generous. I usually double the tax but for this I kept it as is.   I walk up to the cashier and pay with card. He rips off the first receipt and says it very bluntly \"choose one\" and circles the tipping options and stares at me. I say \"no thank you I already tipped you cash.\" So he immediately steps back and calls on the \"radio\" which was clipped to his shirt but says very loudly where the restaurant can hear \"get the money from table 6\" and the guy responds \"Okay I got It\" cashier responds \"What?\" And no longer using their little walkie talkies they said 3. And everyone was like \"THREE?!\" I didn't realize it at the time because I spent an hour waiting for food it was 5 am. I was tired and ready to go home. It was just completely rude.   If they wanted a generous tip they should have given top notch customer service to sober people versus kissing ass to a bunch of drunk idiots who more than likely gave them a stiff. It's a common spot to go here and I've never experienced customer service like this before. Only quality thing they had there was security.. so if you want late night food/pho with a high chance to see a fight(why else is there a security guard at a restaurant) go to pho kim long.  Smh.",

Because of their poor customer service I think most customers stiff them on tips which is totally understandable once you been here. Not sure if their poor attitude is due to bad tips, or they get bad tips because of their poor attitude.",

They were nothing like the picture in the menu. Reminds me of McDonald's menu pictures.   I tried the pho broth and it was just ok. His pho came out in less than 2 minutes, that along with the spring rolls. Out waters came out after...... if that tells you something.  I tried the bun bo hue broth and it tasted exactly the same as the pho. I about got up and left and probably would have if I was by my self. They give you a side of the seasoning to add to the broth which is just plain lazy. If they don't know how to make one of Vietnam's traditional soups then just leave it off the menu instead of embarrassing yourself.  Only reason I came here was because it was a 24hr joint. If you want good Vietnamese food go to pho khan do down the street during regular hours.",

    "text": "How can you not go pho a restaurant by any other name than Pho Kim Long?  Been coming here for the past several years...lunch, dinner, business trip meals. and most often, after clubbing, hehehe. Not on the strip, but worth the little trip to China town.   I always order combination pho, but I have on occasion, partaken in the pan fried noodle dish, I forget what it was called.  The pho is good enough to satisfy my craving; the broth is pretty good(before I add in all my extras) and the fixins are fresh.   Service has always been pretty good here, so no complaints there.  PKL can get pretty busy late night, so I expect service to take a step back due to the stress of the volume of people, more of them drunk and crazy, coming in and out during those times.   Parking can be pretty chaotic; so I would almost always opt for a cab if it's within your means. It's china town, so you know it'll be crazy, even during weekly lunches. Which is again why I would choose not driving if possible.",

I ordered the #18 chicken pho. And my god, if I had a glimpse of heaven, this would be it. The chicken pho was on point like a freshly opened exacto knife. The chicken was good. The broth was perfect. I usually order the beef pho with the special tendons and tripe but this time my cousin and I were really feelin the chicken pho. I'm glad we made this decision. Service was as expected. Just like other pho places. They serve you, you eat, and your group leaves. The pho bowls range from $8-$10. Not bad at all if this is what will revive you from the dead. Or put you on the right tracks of bringing life back to your body.   In conclusion, I was very happy with my meal. I felt like a zombie from the walking dead, eating like there was no tomorrow.",

    "text": "This is my go to place when Im craving a late night meal! This place is an amazing 24/7 restaurant, super close to the strip, right by Chinatown.  Few things to keep in mind.  1. On weekends it does get pretty packed, so don't be surprised if there is a 20 minute wait.  2. Customer service is lacking half of the time, depends on the staff working that shift, just be nice to the staff and call them if you need something. (COMMON CURTESY) 3. Repeat the full order at least once to make sure you get exactly what you want. Sometimes there is a language barrier, once again, so be courteous.  Personally I am not a HUGE fan of the Pho, depending on how busy it may be, but everything else on the menu is fair game. The size of the entree is relatively big for me so I tend to share with who ever I am with, and the prices of most of the meals are under $15. Defiantly a go place to after a long night out with friends.  Personal recommendation-  Fresh springs rolls for appetizer with delicious peanut sauce Drunken noodles or Pad Thai for entree (I like it with chicken) Thai Tea.... because I just love tea :]",

Repeatedly asking us how long when I had told him that the rest of our party had just parked and they were walking in right then.  We ordered our food and didn't receive our drinks until after some of us had been served, which was my first disappointment. We also had to ask three times for extra condiments for our table before someone had brought it to us. When the food came out, my boyfriend had ordered a Pho Tai Chin and our server took our order wrong and forgot the chin (brisket) and then offered to add it on the side. When our bill came out, he had charged us an extra $2.50 for it even though it was his mistake that he took the order wrong. We asked him about it and he said that it would've came out to the same price and I just double checked and he didn't and he actually charged us extra.  I had ordered bun bo hue and for $9.50 a bowl (over priced to me), it was really disappointing and bland even after dumping all of the extra mam ruoc into it and squeezing lemon into it.   After coming up to pay the bill, the cashier charged us $3 when the check had said $2.50 for the extra side of brisket and when my boyfriend had told him that he was wrong he still charged us $3. We were so done with the service that we just paid it. More than one person was rude to us and I will not be returning. It was over priced, we were charged extra for mediocre Vietnamese food. Busy or not there's no excuse for rudeness.",

So the breakdown was 5 people at one table (the table I was a part of) and 6 at the other. My table only had a total of 3 orders (I shared with another and one of us wasn't hungry, but just wanted to hang out). Anyways, in the end they combined our orders (even though we were at separate tables and weren't able to talk to each other). As a result, the imposed gratuity was much more expensive. I walked up and complained that they should split up the order into two separate transactions. They gave me attitude since I was adamant about it. WHEN MY TABLE GOT OUR RECEIPT OF JUST 3 ORDERS, THEY STILL CHARGED US GRATUITY!!!! I was at my breaking point but my friends persuaded me to let them go.   Other nuisances: - Some people at the table ate there before. They have always had pickled onions. This time when we asked for them, the waiters claimed that the restaurant never had them. Liars. - My cousin asked if they had different sizes and they said, \"No.\" Later on, he found out that his friend was able to order a small. Liars.  I reside in Little Saigon, California. All I can say is that the food is mediocre for the price offered (around $6-8). Here, a delicious bowl of pho could sell for $4 for a large.  As a result, for mediocre food that's a little bit too pricey compared to other pho places, the disgraceful service just tops it all for being BLACKLISTED on my list of \"Restaurants That Aren't Worth It.\"",

My husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...They always sit in Ben's section - he makes great recommendations when Chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some orange chicken (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it's always a treat...  Last night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!    Ben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...    Then he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho?  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...  Then he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...  Last night, the spring rolls weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I'll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but I'm still looking for Vegas' best potstickers...   But for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not Asian...), is a real treat.    I've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  It's nice because I'm not the kind of regular that I'd love to be...",

There was no lemongrass in it, and they charged about double what all other places charge for the dish.

They have an extensive menu selection to choose from.  And they are open till like 4-5am.  Food is served really fast and the restaurant is clean, it has been recently remolded.  Great choice for inexpensive late night/ after the club food.",

After a long night of partying and drinking on the strip, my girls and I were in the mood for some good Chinese food.  We asked our taxi driver for his recommendation, and he told us to go to Pho Kim Long for the Vietnamese food.  Man, are we glad we listened to him!  That was the best drunken feast I've ever had in my life. The spring rolls and the honey walnut shrimp were on point!  Everything else was super delish too.  I'm hesitant to give this place 5 stars ONLY because I was slightly inebriated when I dined here, so I don't know how trustworthy my judgment is.  However, I will definitely be coming here next time I hit up Sin City. Pho Kim Long and Pho Kim Gooood =)",

Not just your typical Pho and Spring but also the Catfish claypot and the shrimp pancake watchamakolit.  Atmosphere is definitely better than the others.  The motif reminds me of my grandma's house.  Furnitures are laquered shiny inlayed with mother-of-pearl.  For us females, this is one place we are thankful for not getting our hair stunk.  Overall, food and service are better than other Pho house.",

I have been going here since 06 and can say that this place is always up to snuff, after all night of binge drinking this place is great to satisfy your hungers.   highly recommended go there next time your in Vegas...or ill punch you in the face",

We ordered some iced Vietnamese coffee which always makes me happy.  The menu is huge and has a lot of food that is not Vietnamese.  The boy ordered a combination bowl that had rice, egg rolls, veggies and sauce and was very delicious.  I ordered the duck noodle soup which had a flavorful broth and lots of good stuff in it.  The duck was very good and crispy.  We also ordered a long bean dish with ground pork.  This was my favorite thing by far.  So flavorful, perfectly cooked and I would easily eat only this for a meal, it was so interesting!  Definitely awesome.  Be back soon!",

I was with a large group of people for EDC Week so we asked if we can get separate checks. The server said the manager would do it once we were ready to pay. We stood there waiting at the cash register as he completely ignored us while he was playing around with some receipts. When he finally looks up he rudely tells us he cannot split the check. When I asked why, he said because it was Sunday, enunciating every word he spoke as though I was an idiot. I said ok. SO we scanned the check to see what each one of us owed as he huffed and puffed. Then he grabbed the check and literally guesstimated what each one of us owed. I'm sure he overcharged more than $20 but no problem since we're NEVER returning to this joint.",

Within a few minutes our order comes out. I think they have everything premade because of the amount of people coming to eat. The food was on the salty side. I like a little bit of salty flavor but this was over the top. Not sure if its salt or msg.  I would rate the food maybe 3-4 stars even with it being salty. But it drops to a 2 because of the service and environment. The servers dont even look at you and are so hurried because they have so many people. Either hire more servers or get management to organize the system better because I had about 3 different people come to me.

Had pad Thai sent back for new one which did taste better but still seemed like it had been sitting. White rice was not hot but instead 1 minute from cold soon as the rice container was open. The chicken curry was awful. Currently I have 4 places I willing to go for curry and this won't be one of them.. The chicken was rubbery and there was like 2 TBSP curry sauce on a small skillet dish that was cold... It was so awful here that I felt that poor service was intentional. I endured because my kids were hungry. Since everything was cold, my kids didn't have to worry about tongue and finger burns. My wife was mad she picked another loser",

Normally I have no problem with this place. I love it a lot. My experience ranges from pho, pad Thai, to their clay pots. But tonight I was seriously upset.   I ordered a number 24, the vermicelli with chicken. Half way through my meal, I find a dead bug in there. It was big. About the size of my thumb. I was so disgusted I lost my appetite immediately.   I work at a restaurant myself so I tried not to make a big scene. We quietly called a worker over and explained to him what happened. Showed the bug on a napkin. He nonchalantly said \"oh it must've been in the salad\".  WHAT?! Noooo, sounds like it's happened before. They asked if I wanted anything else, but obviously not after seeing that.   They took of my meal and gave me 20% off on our bill, which we only got Thai teas and crab ragoons but we shouldn't have even paid for anything at all. I was so upset and disappointed that my favorite place in the world, that I just wanted to walk out. Sorry pho Kim long, I can't ever come back. :(",

We had just hiked for a total of 13 hours in the Grand Canyon and stopped here before heading to our hotel. I always crave pho after a hike and unfortunately, the pho here was a complete disappointment.   He had a pho dac biet and I had a meatball pho. The restaurant was busy and our noodles didn't come to the table until 30 minutes later. During the entire time we waited, we were thinking, \"this better be some phoking delicious bowls of noodles!\"   When the noodles came, all I can think was, \"is this pho?!\" My broth was mega salty and the beef flavors and aromatics were nonexistent. His broth was even saltier, which was quite amazing because I thought mine was salty enough. And even worse, our broths tasted completely different even though we both had beef based pho.   Honestly, my boyfriend makes better pho and he's a China boy! Maybe it was a bad day for them, but the pho really turned me off. I most likely will not return.",

On a Saturday night at 11 p.m. we were quoted a 30 minute wait time but ended up only waiting 10 minutes for a table of four.  I live by Little Saigon in Southern California so if comparing to the pho there, Pho Kim Long's pho and bun dishes are normal/about average.  There wasn't anything that stood out good or bad about them.  I had the vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls.  My friends had the pho.    Drinks here are a tad expensive.  I think it was $3.50-$3.75 for Iced Coffee, Fresh Lemonade with Soda, and Preserved Lemon with Soda.    The service here is good.  Numerous servers came to check on/take our order.  If I was craving some late night pho after a night out on the town, I'd come here again.",

    "text": "Wow... now I know why this place is open so late. Sure, Vegas is a city that's open 24/7. But while other places close up shop, this one keeps serving. I didn't even know Vegas had a Chinatown, let alone an Asian mall. I believe I even spotted a Ranch 99! Just like home.... heheh.  I tried the pho, which was decent, but my fiancee ordered the fish hot pot, cooked authentic Vietnamese style. What a taste bonanza! We got the sauce to go, as it could be cooked with a lot of other food.   Only qualms are, like others have mentioned, that the service can be spotty. I had to remind them to bring me my Thai Iced Tea after waiting 10-15 minutes for it. I suspect the waiters are just inexperienced, as many appear to be quite young.",

    "text": "Thank you \"random cosmopolitan valet guy\" for leading us right to best place for pho in Vegas.  Pho Kim Long hits the spot big time. Broth is tasty and service is really swift. My friends ordered different kinds of Pho and were not disappointed.  I personally went with the non-Pho route and ordered the Bun Bo Hue like all my fellow yelpers and it was spectacular.  (Mind you, i'm not really partial to having a beef foot in my soup ... yeah, not really my style - but, it was the bomb. seriously, it was so good.) I'll be back.  I'll definitely be back.  BTW, the eggs rolls were good too.    Side note:  After you've inhaled your grub  - you'll notice that there aren't any cabbies waiting outside to take your semi-sober self back to your hotel on the strip, so you'll have to take a chance at hailing one right on Spring Mountain.  It feels kinda shady at 2a, but you'll be fine if you have a few folks with you.   Side note 2: be careful of saying \"pho-kim-long\" out loud if front of your three year old. He repeats it out in public and people start giving your bad looks :)",

    "text": "Only came here because I got off work late and me and my friend were going out and needed somewhere that was open after midnight. I'd been here before with another friend and it was much nicer. Lets start with the wait.  We came in and put our names on the list, but I could see there were other couples who had obviously been waiting awhile. The place was busy, but no so busy at that time that people should have been waiting very long. I could see open tables from where we were standing. The guy said a 10 minute wait, it was at least 20.  We were brought water and weren't asked if we wanted anything else to drink. They barely gave us time to look before we were being asked if we had decided. My friend is a vegetarian so he needed a moment more and said so. Not even seconds after telling the first waiter, a second one comes over and wants to know if we were ready...i said yes and ordered while my friend asked if they had a vegetarian option available. This is where the service got bad, because the guy got nasty and was like \"Number 21! That what I was just telling you, 21 only vegetarian option for soup\". My friend wasn't asking about soup, he was just asking if they had other options since the menu is ridiculously large and the vegetarian options were all over the place. There was no need for him to get snotty.   Soup wise, it came fast, and the vegetarian soup was good. Mine was honestly lacking in flavor and I needed to add a lot of hoisen and siracha, which I usually do anyway but compared to Saigon 8 where I usually get my pho, it was still kind of lacking in flavor. I could also tell they ignored my request for completely cooked beef since they didnt have an option for one that wasnt paired with raw. My stomach is really sensitive so thankfully I didnt get sick.  Over all, the place is ok if you dont mind shit service, a long wait, and semi decent food late at night, but I will stick with Saigon as their service is at least nice and the soup has flavor. And no, I did not follow their gratuity chart they so kindly circle at the bottom. I dont tip assholes.",

It does get really crowded at prime times and waits can be long. We usually avoid those times.

    "text": "You know you have to try a place when every single person you ask about a good asian place in Vegas tells you to go to Pho Kim Long. My friend and I were there for fun and we were craving some comfort food--her current obsession was Pho, literally once or more times a week. I also am a big phan (aha!) but living in SF, I'm more accustomed to Ramen places so I was also pheeling in the mood phor it (alright, I'm done). I wasn't super in the mood for anything really since I had food poisoning from 2 days before, but I figure the soup would help easy all of the quesy-ness  You can't get to this place easily via walking. Sure, on the map it's like 1ish blocks away from the strip but that is one long-a$$ block, more than 27 minutes!!! So we drove over, one block to Vegas's Chinatown which is almost basically a strip of places all connected with a long parking lot parrallell to it. The restaurant itself  is packed, (also supposedly open 24 hours) and whipping out pho every minute like they had a giant pool of it in the back. We got there at maybe 2pm or so and put our name on the list. Estimated 30 ish minutes so we went over to the Chinese bakery a couple doors down to buy some snacks to go and a little something as an appetizer while we waited.  Perfectly timed, we went back to the restaurant and within a couple minutes we were seated in the still busy, still crowded restaurant. There were even more people on the waitlist now than before! Talk about late lunch....  We ordered and pretty quickly got our food--I took a small combination pho and my friend took the larger with just the flank. It was pretty good and really did sooth my tummy just a bit. The small is actually quite a lot so I'd recommend that unless you're sharing with someone else and taking a couple other dishes. Everything about the Pho was good, the meat, noodles, broth. It was a solid choice. I don't necessarily know if it was really *special* per say but for the price and amount and the speed, it was perfect and beats any other place we ate at in Vegas.  Service is a little slow since there's so many people. When we finished, we waited AGES for them to bring the check, and then another couple of ages before they brought the card back with the receipt to sign. However, for about $12 a head, it was great and I'd definitely recommend it.",

My daughter was feeling sick all of a sudden and I wasn't feeling well either (perhaps the same bug plus a touch of drinking?) - so what better cure than some late night pho? The taxi ride was super cheap and worth it to come cure our ailments.  When we got there around 10pm, we were surprised at how packed it still was! Sucks, but usually indicates that there's something worth waiting for. SO glad we waited! I'm a bit particular about my pho and theirs was soooo good. The broth was made just right and tasted very clean (if that makes sense). The portions were huge and we even took some back to our hotel.  We also got a plate of pad thai and that was also equally amazing. The flavor was right on, perfect amount of sauce and portion was plentiful.   We were definitely rejuvenated after our meals. My husband, our two daughters and I have a trip scheduled to Vegas in June and we're definitely planning to go back. It seriously beats some pricier spots on the strip. If you love pho and pad thai, I'd definitely recommend coming here for that fix!!!",

They immediately give you a glass of water once we were seated at our table. There was a lot of items on the menu but my friends and I usually order a couple plates of calamari and the combination pho.   Our food always comes out quick and it's satisfying being able to eat something with a few minute time frame.  Calamari is beautifully fried with marinara sauce on the side and the combination pho comes in a huge bowl and is awesomely satisfying.  This will always be one of my spots for late night meal.",

I've been getting spoiled with these fat noodle pho joints...Honestly, if it were 3am and I really wanted pho, I think it probably would be just perfect.  The FRESH SPRING ROLL and the FRIED SPRING ROLL were really good - the spring rolls were more of a hit than the pho.  Great peanut sauce and dipping sauce for the fried ones too.  The COCONUT was really tasty.  They give you a spoon and crack open the top as well, but just drinking the juice was so refreshing!  There is a clipboard with a waiting list at the front.  Not the friendliest service but just deal.  Small waiting area and crowded parking lot.  The restaurant is pretty big but it seems to fill up too.  It looks like the restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant since the style doesn't look like your typical pho place.  To be fair, it's better than any other pho I've had on the strip, but that's not saying much.  So if you can get off the strip for pho, this one is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I used to come here every time I was in Vegas and they have definitely changed owners because nothing tastes the same. It doesn't taste good anymore and it's disappointing in general as they're trying to pass off authentic Vietnamese food for...not authentic Vietnamese food.  They serve different foods like wings and more American-ized/Fusion dishes next to their noodle and rice dishes. I wasn't able to try the newer stuff but their usual food is not good anymore! Super disappointing.  Already skeptical, I tried to order the most fool-proof food on the menu. I ended up getting wonton noodle soup.   HOW DO YOU MESS UP WONTON NOODLE SOUP? Well, somehow they managed to. The soup base had this weird flavor when it should have been more like a chicken broth (How do you mess that up? If they're lazy, just use chicken broth?! Even Swanson's would have more flavor. I don't get it). Additionally, the wontons were smaller than a ping pong ball...HOW DID I PAY MONEY FOR THIS?",

My friends like the broth of their pho and it's pretty tasty for what it is. It gets pretty packed on the weekend, but the wait time isn't that long because the service is good and quick.",

But the last time I came here was a horrible experience overall. Even though their food came out fast like always the waiter sucked. He didn't care about what any of us wanted. There were three of us and it wasn't super busy. It was around 1Am because they're open 24 hours. I asked if I could get a pho no meat and he told me they didn't have that, when I get it every time I come. I'm not a regular but I know they have it because it's the only thing I get. Anyway since I didn't get a pho no meat because they \"didnt have it\" I asked for a pho tai. My boyfriend got the same thing, and I told them no vegetables only lemon. Yet they still gave me onions and every vegetable in the soup, and they gave us the bean sprouts and everything. It sucks because none of us uses the sprouts, mint, or Jalepenos. I will point out that I noticed their vegetables always look fresh and clean. But besides that our veges were pretty much wasted. Besides the waiter messing that up. The broth doesn't really have a taste or flavor, It's pretty bland You can say it's cause I ordered a pho tai and didn't add plenty of veges inside but I've had pho from manyyyy places and this is the only place where their pho beef broth taste like nothing.",

First and foremost, the server never came by after taking the initial order when we clear clearly indicated that we wanted another item. Then after the food arrived he never followed up to check on us.   The duck was extremely over cooked. It was like turkey it was so dry. What a waste of money. If I wasn't starving... many complaints would have been made at the time but I was done waiting for food. The salt and pepper pork was yummy.   Now what really annoyed me is that they essentially forced me to tip either 15, 18, or 20%. It was just me and my boyfriend not a big party. And if you are going to pre-tip, at least add it correctly. Like how rude of you to give horrible service and then make someone pay tip and add extra.   Sneaky shady business. The amount is not at issue, the fact that the this practice is allowed is ridiculous.",

After signing on their wait list for 15 minutes, we were the second from the TOP list. One of the manager, Jonathan, called another name with a party of five on the third position from the BOTTOM of the list to the table. I asked him why he called out of turn. He responded that their party was bigger. I said a party of four and a party of five wouldn't make any difference. I wouldn't appreciate if he did so. He quickly responded to me that if I didn't like it, I could leave and pointed his finger to the door.  Wow this was the first time in my life that a manager of a restaurant actually didn't care about his customer that much. He would ask his customers to leave when it was his fault.  I don't know how the owner of this restaurant will deal with this manager's terrible behavior. However, if it was me, I would have a zero tolerance policy for that kind of very behavior.",

The broth of the pho wasn't served hot enough so at the end of the meal, my red meat was still raw.   The restaurant is also not forthcoming about pricing. They charged extra for meatballs even though it's not listed on the menu that there is an extra charge and the waiter failed to mention the additional cost. They also automatically charged gratuity even though I was with a party of 5, not 6. There was nothing positive about the experience.

The tables around us had a mix of patrons who ordered rice dishes and pho. All the people with rice dishes got their dishes before pho came out. One guy at the table next to us had to ask where his pho was when his friends had already eaten most of their rice dishes. I don't mind the waiting since it's Vegas and we all wait, but don't selectively feed the table that came in after me because their dishes are quicker to make. At least three tables were filled before mine.   The waiter only came to give us food and the check. No one refilled water or asked anything else. And, they were stacking tables next to us and moving chairs, which was fine. Then they miscounted and there were 17 guest so they needed our table and chairs. That was fine but we were waiting on them to return our credit card so we couldn't go anywhere. It was absolutely ridiculous and no paying customer should ever have to go through that at 11am (by now it was 11).   I always tip 20% or more but this time, I tipped 10%.  In addition to terrible service, food was mediocre and nothing more. Bun bo hue was bland and the pho was meh. Listen to your yelper and go to another pho place. There's so many of them around here that probably has better quality food and service.  Update: The food gave me food poisoning. Yay...",

For the main course we shared the Beijing beef and the Pad Thai combo with chicken, pork, and shrimp. Both were excellent and was a nice contrast in flavors. The Beijing beef had a tangy sweet sauce and the Pad Thai wasn't overly spicy but very flavorful.  Portions are large and more than enough to share. We had no room for dessert but noticed they had boba tea so maybe next time. Total bill for 1 appetizer and 2 dinners came to $40.

If you guys are ever in the OC area please go get yourself some real pho ANY pho location in the OC would beat this place. I don't think they know what it should taste like here weird because they have been in business since 1997.  Even though Pho is in there name I suggest you DO NOT GET PHO HERE. I would suggest just go to lees sandwiches it's 24/7 as well probably won't even have to wait long regret eating here should have gone with Lees. OH and another note everything was so dirty I asked for extra bowls they came soaked wet and had bits of debris in them and two of the spoons that gave me had permanent debris on it as well even though I tried so hard to wipe if off with a napkin. One thing I would say is decent is their workers, service is good here I see all the workers hustling sorry that they don't serve good food. Would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "After me and my ex failed attempt to eat at Hot n Juicy on a Wednesday night because of their hour long wait list we came to Pho Kim.  We've had it before and so she knows what she now wants.  She ordered a mango w/boba, the shrimp and crab with egg noodles, and calamari.  I ordered a coconut, pho kim egg rolls, and the meat combination pho.  Everything tasted great as usual but this time we got our appetizers out first which was rare.  I've always had the pho come out first.  It was the first time my ex had the egg rolls and I was trying to teach this white girl how to wrap it in the leaf but it wasn't going to happen.  The broth was extra tasty this time, I like the rice noodles but my ex likes the egg noodles.  Both taste great.  The coconut always comes out fresh.  Service was quick and the restaurant was clean.    Every time we come here we say next time we're going to try something different!  We never do.  So give yourself a treat and grab some pho here.  A plus plus plus to Pho Kim is their 24 hour service!  Perfect for me if I'm in the area while at work!",

A group of five girls can be very annoying/demanding, but they handled it very well. The broth was light and really hit the spot after the long drive over to Vegas. This place would be great for day-after hangovers! I wasn't craving brisket this time, so I ordered the shrimp pho. The shrimp were pretty small in size, but they give a decent amount. It went well with the broth too. My friends also ordered some fried rice to go. We knew that we'd be hungry when we got home after a night out, and their fried rice re-heated nicely.  Btw, you will leave smelling like you took a bath in pho. :)",

    "text": "Imagine this Scenario:  Drunk Girl: Pho Kim Long! Pho Kim Long! Pho Kim LOOOOOOOOONG PLEASE!!!  Cab Driver (language barrier): Me love you long time? *wink wink*  Drunk Girl: Yes, me love you long time if you bring me to PHO KIM LONG! FTW!!!  To be Continued...  Thank goodness, we came here sober because who knows what would have happened if we \"attempted\" to come to PKL DRUNK in a cab especially with a restaurant name like \"Pho Kim Long\". :X  On Saturday, December 11th, my friend and I came to PKL at 2:45 PM (OPEN 24 HOURS) to nurse our massive hangovers and our growling stomachs. PKL was half filled and we were seated immediately. PKL is only a 5 min drive from the Strip which is about a $8 cab ride. CC's are accepted.  F O O D: The menu is quite expensive so you can satisfy your Vietnamese craving for pho, bun, com or your Chinese craving for chow fun, ma po tofu, or various dishes with XO sauce for example.   *CHA GIO (Vietnamese Egg Rolls - $6): Meh! I like my cha gio wrapped in rice paper wraps because it creates a crispier and flakier shell. The ones at PKL is wrapped in the standard egg roll wrapper made with flour and water which seems to doesn't maintain its crispness long.   The cha gio arrived room temperature and some parts of the wrapper was soggy. The filling pork filling was a bland and the nuoc mam cham (fish sauce) was watered down as it was missing the pungency from the fish sauce and the spiciness from the chilies.   *COMBO PHO ($7.95): The PERFECT hangover cure! The pho was flavorful and comforting, but coming from SF it's not the best I've had. Nevertheless, it IS best and  most \"authentic\" pho you will get near the Strip.   The rice noodles were tender and al-dente and swimming in a pool of rich and savory beefy broth that wasn't laden with MSG. The rare beef slices and beef brisket were soft and tender, while the beef balls had a nice chewy spring to it. The bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno and lime were fresh and were the perfect compliment to pho adding a nice crunch and freshness.   My only gripe is there were no tendons or tripe in the combo nor was there any pho options with them.   *FRESH YOUNG COCONUT ($3.50): The SECRET Hangover Cure!!! Coconut water contains all five of the essential electrolytes: calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and sodium needed for effective rehydration and has 15 times the amount of potassium as most sports drinks. So this is a MUST order along with your pho if you want to effectively nurse your hangover.  Coconut water taste a little but like metallic water with a very hint sweetness so you can add sugar to it but you should really drink it a la natural. Make sure to eat the creamy flesh of the coconut because it improves insulin secretion and utilization of blood glucose.  S E R V I C E: The staff is incredibly nice, attentive and fast which is rarity for Asian restaurants. Our food came out within 5 minutes which is typical of most pho restaurants and the manager (?) checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was ok.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R: Dark rich woods, granite tables, various Vietnamese and Chinese shrines, and elaborate fish tanks with exotic fishes create a very nice and upscale environment.   There are over 25 tables that are well-spaced out, so you don't have to worry about rubbing elbows with your neighbor.   With the festivities of drunken debauchery that occurred this weekend and the aforementioned scenario in my head, why do I feel like it WILL happen on my next trip to Vegas? *covers eyes*",

    "text": "Some of my brother's Vietnamese friends eat pho for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  There are lots of pho places around Vegas where he lives, So when he wants  this even at midnight, Pho Kim Long is his go to place. They also make some decent Chinese food. Some of the tables around us had your usual pan fried noodles, whole fried fish, and sweet and sour pork.  But most people had pho.   Although more salty than I personally like, the simple broth and noodles has a light, nice aroma served in a large bowl.  Add meat, like rare steak slices, along with some condiments, like basil, bean sprouts, and onions ($7), it was an awesome meal in itself.  I was going to order the same thing, but for the same price, you can get a half rotisserie small chicken with rice.  It was crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside ($7). So simple, yet so good.  Customers are mostly families during the day till early evening.  After that, they're the winners and mostly losers from the casinos, and sobering drunken clubbers and night shift workers. The inside is comofrtable and nicely appointed with ample booths or tables. During lunch dinner. no matter what day, it is crowded.  Finding a parking spot, however, is a war of patience and luck.  Fortunately, a guy was pulling out just as we walked inside, so we didn't have to exhibit our Type A parking lot Ninja tactics. While waiting to be seated, I enjoyed their relaxing goldfish tanks.   This place is so typical Vegas with a Vietnamese and Chinese twist. I'd go back to try a few more dishes.  Service was good, prompt with the soda ($2) refills and special requests, and making sure all was OK.",

There are hit and misses when it came to the food. The beef stew rice noodle I got was made very well, but two of my friends' foods looked and tasted bad. The waiter will give out suggestions, and I think those usually are the most popular/freshes/specialty things that the restaurant is known for. Order that.  I heard this place is best for late-night hangover/Pho fix. To be honest, If you were traveling here for vacation and was looking for good eats, I'd rather fork over a few extra dollars and enjoy a good buffet on the strip.",

We've been here in the past with 10 people and getting a table wasn't difficult but because we added one more person this time they said they were unable to seat us at a table we had sat at before due to size. I'm sorry but 1 extra person doesn't make that big of a difference. Even after we got our table (because we didn't have time to waste to go try and find someplace else) the hostess apologized in an insincere way. My family and I will sadly not be coming back to this location that I use to be so found of.",

The broth was not too sweet or too sour; it had the right consistency to it. They gave us a lot of noodles but that's not a bad thing made me full pretty fast.

    "text": "Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.  Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.  When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.  During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more \"True\" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.  However, here's the issue:  NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.  So...... basically......  Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.",

The quality of the Pho' isn't what past experiences has brought me to remember...not even close to the amount of noodles they used to give and the broth was mediocre at best...... I was sooooo looking forward to my old Pho Kim Long, and this wasn't it!!",

Once we did get our table we felt so incredibly rushed it was slightly uncomfortable.   As for the food, we ordered a classic pho which was rather large and had plenty of noodles- the broth its self was certainly homemade but relatively bland. The best purchase we made was the Mongolian beef and beer. The Mongolian beef isn't served with rice so make sure to get a side order. The flavor was excellent and the beef strips weren't fatty, I would order it again.   They lose stars for the level or service and unimpressive pho. Kudos for the great Mongolian beef.",

Of course I called and spoke to a manger to let him know we have never been to this restaurant and therefore the 90 dollar charge we received was fraudulent. He then insisted our card must have been stolen and we should take it up with our bank. We informed him that our card wasn't stolen and is still in our possession yet he continued to argue that it must have been stolen. I'm not sure how this person managed to do this and I understand that maybe nothing could be done after they already charged the 90 dollars to our account. But after our conversion with this manger he still went ahead AFTER we informed him that this was someone committing fraud with our information and charged us an additional 20 dollars!!! Needless to say I'm pissed and will be going down to their place of business to discuss this in person.",

Pho Kim Long was only half a mile away.    I ordered my usual pho dac biet.  The prices were slightly higher than what I was used to in San Francisco, but it was well worth it. I'm not sure if it was because I was hungover or because I hadn't had pho in a long time, but I thought the broth was fantastic!  Everything else in the bowl was standard.

Pho in some places have that eeewww taste to it from not scooping out the gray meat foam when they boil the meat.  At Pho Kim Long, I've never had a bad bowl of pho.  It always tastes clean.  I get the one with the brisket and rare steak all the time...sooo good!  I also like their charbroiled porkchop with rice, egg rolls and spring rolls with Thai tea on the side.  Come here any time of the day since they're open 24hours/day.  Good place after partying, nursing a hangover or just because they have good pho (pronounced 'fuh' not 'foe').  Remember, you're coming here for the food, nothing else.  Expect obnoxious and sober tourists from 6pm to 11pm, obnoxious and drunk tourists from midnight to 5am Friday to Sunday, and locals all other times/days.",

The drive is not far at all. $10 max. on Uber or taxi if you don't have a car.  What's even better is that this place is open 24 hours! I like coming here on Sundays for lunch before I head back to LA. There's usually a small wait, but nothing too crazy. The restaurant is pretty big, and food comes out fast. Service is okay. Some waiters are a little rude, but they get the job done.  I usually order the rare beef and well done flank pho. They give a ton of meat. The small size is the perfect portion for me - big enough to warm me up inside and cure any headaches, but not too big where I feel like throwing it all up along with the alcohol I had the previous night.  They have many other options in addition to pho. A lot of Chinese dishes served family style. Sometimes I crave rice when I drink, so this place really covers all my drunk munchies.",

This place has been on my \"to-do\" list for a while even though there are some very mixed reviews.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table, gave our order to the waitress, and were served about 5 minutes later. FAST! Tables here are turned very quickly and efficiently so they can accommodate the crowds.   We both had the number 16, combo Pho, and it was very good. The broth was not too salty or watery, there were plenty of ingredients in the broth, and the entire meal came together well. I've had slightly better pho in Vegas, but not at this price point.  Dinner for two was right at $20, which I consider to be very reasonable. I normally pay in the $15 range, per person...  The restaurant was clean, food was very good, and service was spot on as long as you realize they are able to offer these prices by turning tables quickly.

Our sever was semi okay, but my friends seemed to think otherwise as he made faces when my friend asked for a substitution. The food was average. I don't think any of us thought it was poorly made or anything great in nature.   I had some sort of Japanese fried noodle. I really can't remember exactly what it was. It tasted okay, but I thought it was a bit on the oily side. I think other menu item choices would have been better. My friend's fiancee had the pho ga, he said it was good.

All the meals but one were brought out, I don't know what happened but when we asked it appears the kitchen tried to rush out the dish which ended up being gooey under cooked seafood. The food used to be so good but everyone  in our group said there food was just not good last night.",

    "text": "I've only tried two orders so far. A combo beef bowl and a Vietnamese coffee that is iced. Nothing really stood out unfortunately with just one visit. The place is pretty big and they delivered pho as it should be. However a few questionable things regarding their service. When I came in, the table I had come to still had a bean sprout laying on the table making it uncertain if the table was indeed cleaned or not. However I was greeted promptly as I came in. The water they served was clear and no specks were visible. The Vietnamese coffee was bitter and sweet as it should be ^_^ and my Pho came in a timely manner. The beef was placed in raw which I expected and it was cooked just in time. The bean sprouts in the side however was very moist and looked soggy. Unfortunately I did not try it since I was too concerned on how questionable it looked. Over all the ambience was decent, the staff was above average.  In the end however left a bad taste on my first and maybe only visit; my receipt had the tip suggestion encircled, which to me seemed passive-aggressively demanding.   Overall I give this place a thumbs up. I got my order, got what I wanted and no mistakes were made. Only graded this place down for poor customer service and questionable food prep and cleanliness.",

I felt like I was sipping a bowl of hot water with mediocre noodles in it. Moreover, the Bun Bo Hue advertised pork feet, but had no meat from the trotters, only a generous serving of bones and inedible gristle. I love bits of tender tendon or well cooked pig's feet but this was dreadful. Add a largely indifferent plus inattentive service atmosphere and you have a restaurant succeeding purely on location. Pho kim long is right in the middle of things, surrounded by excellent restaurants, many if which I frequent. This had to be the worst I have found.",

I like how their service is quick and the food comes out quick. Lots of people waiting for a table? No worries. The wait is never that long. Their take out is also quick. Therefore, I could get a good meal in before my lunch break ends.   I ONLY come here for their pho and fried egg rolls. I don't order anything else other than that.  I typically order the pho tai, which is the pho with rare steak.   The consistency, however, is not always there. Sometimes the broth is good, but sometimes the broth is really watered down.   Best part of Pho Kim Long is that it's open 24 hours. Late night clubbing and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night hotel party and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Late night drinking and got hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. Shitfaced and hungry? No problem. Pho Kim Long it. HAHA You get the idea!  Though, one time, it took them 20 minutes to get my take out order ready. So that was a meh :/",

I usually get the Pho Tai (rare steak meat) and if I'm feeling extra hungry, the egg rolls with peanut sauce. The egg rolls are so bomb!! This place usually gets pretty packed and at the times the service is almost inexistent.

The waiting area is very small and there isn't much room outside on the sidewalk either.   We were told our table was ready so we followed the lady towards the back of the restaurant. As we were walking another group of people stood up from their table and the hostess says to us \" oh you wait 3 min and you take that table instead.\"  So we waited as they cleared our table. When it was cleaned we sat down and they brought our plates and utensils. There were food particles on some of them so we pushed them off to the side. My daughter grabbed some chopsticks and those had a piece of dried on paper stuck to them. Ewwww  We ordered our food and waited. I realize that they are busy but drinks should not take so long as to come out before food.   All the food tastes good. I love the chicken wings. In my opinion they are the best anywhere. They have some kind of garlic seasoning on it without being over garlicky. We ordered chicken chow mein, shrimp chow mein, pad tai and beef chow fun. Yeah we ordered a bunch of needles. LoL. The noodles tasted good. Chow fun is my favorite kind of noodle.   What was weird is when I got my bill, the lady asked  me how much I would tip. I told he $18 then she went off to process my credit card. When it came back she had written in the amount. Huh? It was also written weird. I rewrote what the tip was and signed the CC statement. It was very bizarre experience that day. If that had been my first experience there I'm not sure I would be going back. Since I have been there several time I know this is not the norm.",

My friend that was with me eats only gluten free so we called ahead and asked if they had GF options, they said they did. Pulled up there was a long line outside. The line did move fast, we only waited about 15 minutes. Once we were seated nobody came around for our order for a while then when a waitress came she was rushing us and knew nothing about the menu. Nobody knew what GF even meant once we got there. I thought maybe the food would make up for the bad service. It didn't. Got a huge bowl of egg drop soup and orange chicken. The soup was on par with low end restaurants close to home and the orange chicken was not fresh and not good. If you're in Vegas stay on the beaten path!",

So I sat,  was greeted by the server within seconds,  he brought us waters and went through the menu with us quickly. I ordered Terarki chicken and it was the best I have ever had. Being from the east, and living so close to NYC, and NJ I have had my fair share of A+ food, but this has to be the best I have tasted since my move West.

    "text": "I've been to this restaurant over 10x and tonight  I ordered the udon noodle stir fry with chicken.  First, the dish comes out and it's on a small plate; not the regular stir fry plate which is fine but I made a comment like wow that's small for $14 to my server(he was cool).  Then, I noticed the plate is super greasy. Like the noodles were sitting in a oil sauce. I take a bite and the udon is super greasy. So I flag my waiter down and instantly he says; \"yea it even looks greasy let me tell my manager.\" So he takes my plate and he stops the manager about a table away, hands him my plate who hands it to another waiter who then hands it back to my waiter. He comes back over to tell me that the manager said no I can't send it back. So my response was \"can your manager come over here please?\" So then the manager comes to tell me that's not the portion it comes in and that it looks like I ate half.... wtf that's what I said when it came out. So what do I want? This man takes the plate and throws it on the empty table to the right of us. We are in disbelief the guy at the table on the left of us starts apologizing because he can't believe what he just saw.  We all work in the service industry and couldn't believe it. Then my waiter had asked what I would like instead and I said a small rare beef pho, he said ok....  15 minutes go by, the guy on our left who is also a frequent diner here is literally in disbelief we all were just chatting about how crazy this experience has been and how the quality of this restaurant has gone down in the last few months.   Our waiter comes and asks if we're ready for the check and so I go \"do I not get pho?\"  And informs us that the manager refused to let him ring in another order for me...... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never once asked for anything but edible food. Even stated that I didn't care about paying, I just wanted to eat!!!!!! Like are you fucking kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!! I literally never cuss and especially not in a public setting like this. I love pho and I love pho Kim long but I have never ever in my life had such terrible customer service in my life. The waiter then apologized and said that he was so sorry and said that the manager is kinda crazy and he has no idea why everyone was in a bad mood tonight!!!!!!!! If I could give this waiter a job elsewhere I most definitely would. I am so dissatisfied and disappointed in this restaurant.",

Hail a cab and get yourself to Pho Kim Long, which is an enormous Vietnamese restaurant that's pretty much where everyone goes to recover. The pho is pretty good -- fragrant with lots of meat and noodles, served in big bowls that will not only provide you with much-needed hydration, but carbs to soak up that alcohol, protein to give you energy, salt to replenish your electrolytes. It's not so much an eating destination for flavor, although this can be an experience in and of itself considering that a lot of people go here, but a place you go for much-needed recovery. My only quibbles: sometimes there's a wait, sometimes the wait for the pho can be longer than expected. It gets busy. There is, admittedly, sometimes a language barrier. Just embrace it, eat you pho, maybe meander through the plaza to go grab more food to eat in the dark hovel of your hotel room in shame & recover because let's be honest, you're going to do the same thing all over again.  Must-gets: pho... come on. But I'm a softy for anything w/ brisket & rare steak, and even though I don't usually like them, like, ever, this is the one place I like their meatballs.",

Also, I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated here. Not only is this place open till the wee hours of night, long after you've consumed multiple shots of alcohol and danced your booty off, but there's nothing better to cure a typical Vegas hangover than some MORNING-AFTER PHO!! I know there's now places to get pho on the Strip, but Pho Kim Long tastes authentic and you can get a decent meal for under 10 bucks.   I love this place. And it's a cult favorite. Literally every time I go I unintentionally run into someone I either know from 1) my sorority, 2) Los Angeles, or 3) other random people.  Virtually everyone who's a Vegas regular knows about this place and has been here.  And FYI - I have also had pho here when I was NOT drunk, and enjoyed it!  Recently they've had a restaurant makeover, making the place more classy. Yes, you can expect to see people there of all ages - from seniors, to children, to under dressed club hos.  Parking is easy as it is located in a small Asian strip mall. It's also about a 10-15 minute drive from the Strip, which is not exactly pedestrian friendly but definitely worth the trip if you have a car.",

    "text": "What. A. Joke. Las Vegas? What on EARTH are you thinking?!  It's 2am. I want some pho. To YELP I go. This seems to be the only place open. Parked. I see a sign that says they were voted best pho in LV and there is a wait. Yes, a 20 minute wait at 2am. It must be decent. BOY WAS I WRONG!  We were told it'd be a 20 minute wait so we just took a quick walk down the strip mall. We came back not 5 minutes later and waited another 20 minutes. I eventually go up and ask him when our table will be ready and he said that our names were called like 20 minutes ago. Say what? So apparently a 20 minute wait means 5 minutes now? Get your timing right! So i asked to be put back on the list and there was probably another 4-5 groups that came after me. Well, he sat all of them first. We  only needed a 3-top and all those other groups were pretty much the same size if not larger. I reminded him and he barely even gave me any attention. Eventually we got seated. The service sucked, the food was horrid (none of us finished), and we definitely didn't tip. I know the table next to us was also very unhappy and also didn't tip. You'd be lucky to get anyone's attention since they zip by you at warp speed.   It was past 3am and I was unfulfilled. I will NEVER be back here. Yelpers, this is fair warning.",

To sum it all up the guy was very rude and the pho was not good, we don't plan on coming here again, there are a lot better places in town for pho.",

This is so disappointing & especially for one of the top known Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. I took my smoothie home because I've gotten full from their food but as I started drinking my smoothie... I don't know if the little piece of \"sharp\" metal was in my actually drink or in the boba balls but regardless it SHOULDN'T had even been in the drink !!! Huge warning/red flag!!! It's sad..

    "text": "I am a fan. and this is why. The Pho may not be the best you've ever tasted, but Its pretty damn good. I mean really how many ways is there to make Pho? Had the Beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. Aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. Fried Calamari, was probably the best i have had, I couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. I can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the salted fish fried rice was also flavor, and you could actually taste the salted fish unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes I get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had.   Just to comment on people talking about service and such, I don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because I consider myself asian myself. But the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. Some of the best places I have eaten at in California were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. I once went to a place in San Francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was",

    "text": "Even though this is a Vietnamese restaurant, we always visit here for the Chinese food.  In fact, this is the Chinese food place we like to take guests too... I really really enjoy the food here.  The ambience of the place is not bad actually.  The decorate the place well, its large, and its cleaner than most Asian restaurants.  I think the prices are fair also - about 10 bucks a dish (more or less), I think maybe 7 for the pho.  Portions are of decent size.  I can't say much about the pho here, because I never really order it.  The boyfriend does though, and I've tasted it.  I think it's just OK.   When I go here, there are always dishes that I always have to get because it's DELICIOUS and awesome:  - House special pan fried noodles (chow mein)... Noodles soft in the middle, crispy on edges (AWESOME).  Saucy, flavorful and lots of goodies like bok choy and shrimp.  - The cubed beef with Chinese broccoli - Make sure you specifically ask for the cubed beef - they have regular beef and broccoli which is not so good.  The cubed beef is pretty much a MUST HAVE.  - Salt and Pepper Porkchops or Squid - Depending on my mood... love to have some deep fried pork chips or calamari with salt and pepper seasonings with my meal.  YUM.  The one thing about this place which I wish I could change is the wait staff.  It always feels like are trying to get you in and out quickly... and they aren't the friendliest either.  The service is usually pretty quick though I guess.  Also on the plus side, they are open all night so it's a great place to hit up after drinking.    Overall - even though the service is MEH... I have to give it at least a 4 just because of my favorite dishes I mentioned above.",

But what I HATE the MOST is the service when I ordered to GO. The manager will say over the phone that it's like 45 minutes or so. But when I got there after 1 HOUR  the manager will say that it's NOT YET READY, that I have to WAIT ANOTHER 20 minutes for them to get me the soup. I DON'T KNOW IF HE DO IT ON PURPOSE OR WHAT??? And this is the third time already that they did this.  It's his voice on the phone how I can tell he's the one that looked my order. THE MANAGER HIMSEL AT THE FRONT.  NASTY ATTITUDE...that I won't forget. Infac t, sometimes when we passes by and saw that it was him  in the front we just live and decided not to eat just so that we don't get this kind of service. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME....   I would have give a 0 (ZERO) OR  even negative 1 for the score but it wasn't here.

Then my boyfriend goes up and talks to the one guy not in uniform, he wears a hat all the time.. then he went to tell him what happened and the Uly was explains that it's there.. my bf came back  and let it go but yet the guy came after him yelling at like I sat you after them blah blah.. you ordered 2 mins ago.. and he kept saying it's fine and yet the guy kept harassing him.. then he wants to ask the guy next to us how long he's been sitting there. He got there after us and people took his order and didn't take ours. We've been ready yet they take so long to take our order. The guy in the hat kept getting into his face and harassing him. What kind of customer service is that? Like I don't care if you're a manager but if you're gonna talk to your customers rudely you shouldn't be in a place like that. Then you wanna talk to 2 customers about us and be like \" they're probably having a bad day.\" The guy kept saying to us that maybe we're having a bad day.. you have no place to talk about us like that especially to other customers. You are in the wrong because it crosses peoples privacy. Never coming back again, I'll find a better & nicer pho place than you guys. I hope the manger reads this and thinks about how to train employees to talk to their customers",

We got to Pho Kim Long, and giggled like idiotic teenage boys, at around midnight. The place was slammed. Super busy. We were seated immediately, and the hostess was incredibly friendly. We call this \"Las Vegas\" friendly. Like they're so used to tourists, it's just second nature to make the assumption that we're not from the area and treat us kindly so as not to destroy our vacation. There's a lot of this over there, and for that we're super grateful, being earthy, awkward Portlandians.   We ordered our drinks (I just had water, my partner ordered a beer) and before my partner's beer even had the chance to arrive we were served our starter (the salad rolls), followed quickly by the two delicious orders of Pho. Their peanut sauce was splendid, and the pho makes this my second favorite of all pho places I've been to, ESPECIALLY at midnight! The beer, unfortunately, came toward the end of dinner which is a no-no as far as my partner is concerned. Given the volume of customers that night, and the wonderful food and friendly, quick service, it was forgivable enough for us to come back and order take away to take back to our room a couple nights later when we were actually craving that delicious soup! We cannot wait to order from them again, in house or take away, either way the food is just as wonderful!",

So because he told us it would be a long wait we decided to order to go. It was a small order there were only two of us girls and we paid first of course after he took our order. He then insists we tip him on a TO GO order ALSO insisting we give a certain amount!? Normally I would have no problem tipping even on a to go order but why would I tip before I even get my service? So he rudely makes comments under his breath when he thinks we weren't going to tip-then makes a no tip note on our order and we WATCHED people get seated on tables who came way after we ordered & RECEIVE their entire meal before us. THEN at this point we're absolutely disgusted at this service we walk up and wait directly infront of the rude cashier. We asked another worker if this was our order he was preparing because we've been waiting extremely long and the cashier leans over and tells him ITS THIS ONE- THE NO TIP NO TIP! At this point we knew he purposely made a note to have our order take way longer than it should have! PEOPLE WHO CAME 15 min after us were EATING. I am so disgusted I will NEVER give them my business again.",

    "text": "2-Stars is me being generous.   Food: Overpriced, mediocre, nothing special, and not to mention my friend received a piece of a plastic bag in his bowl of pho and I crunched into a shell-like component in my spring roll.  - Pho: We all ordered the combination pho (pho ac biet) and it was large, tasty, but lacked a key element that we all enjoy in our combination pho - tripe. Apparently they do not sell tripe there (said the waitress). But they did make up for it by giving us generous portions of brisket and additionally included meatballs (bo vien) which I typically do not see in combination pho at other restaurants. The broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus. But I do believe a bowl of pho for about $9 is on the expensive side. All in all I would give their pho 3.5 stars.  - Spring rolls: I will post a picture of their spring rolls. They were composed of minimal elements for high-dollar. $5.50 for 2 spring rolls is super pricey in my book, especially because these spring rolls were far from anything special. Rice noodles, shredded lettuce, pork, and shrimp wrapped in rice paper (so basic!). They didn't even bother to add bean sprouts, mint leaves, or green onion to enhance the flavors. Also, their dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the peanut-side (some don't mind it but I prefer an equal balance). Never ordering spring rolls from them again (unless they actually read this post and start making better spring rolls and sauce).   Service: They took the pho (with plastic) and an order of spring rolls off our bill which was nice - but is expected when serving non-edible components in your food. When we notified our waitress about the plastic in my fiends bowl of pho, she quickly took it away and had another combination pho delivered to us pronto. The service is what saved this place from getting only 1-star.   Decor: Pretty modern but tries to keep an authentic Asian feel with the bonsai trees and fish tanks.   I suppose this place had a decent rep because it's open 24-hours and the name is catchy. I wanted to like this place but all-in-all, my experience was not one to bring me back. I can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places. Maybe if I was in desperate need of pho at a weird time of the night, I might settle for Pho Kim Long... Until then, Yelpers beware.",

    "text": "Rainy day...a little chilly....so what to have lunch? Pho of course! Rather than head to one of our usual spots, we decided to try a new place that I read about that came recommended by a local concierge.   I checked the reviews on Yelp and they were mostly positive, so away we went!  We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. I had read that finding parking was a nightmare, but the day we went, we found plenty of available parking.   Upon entering the restaurant, we could see that they were adequately busy. However, we were seated right away and handed menus.   Serving staff was on it. Within minutes we had our drinks and our order taken. We opted for the Kim Long fried egg rolls (chicken) and chicken wings with Kim Long Sauce for starters. My hubby ordered the #13 (Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup) and I ordered the #14 (Rare Steak Noodle Soup).  Again, within minutes, our egg rolls arrived. Delish! Crispy, hot and served with lettuce, mint and shredded carrot mixture. Wrapped our egg rolls in the lettuce, added mint and carrot garnish and dipped in the accompanying sauce...awesomeness!  Next came the chicken wings. These babies were tiny!!! I guess because they were so small, we received about 15 of them on the plate. Even though they were tiny, the skin was nice and crispy and the flavor was great! I thought they would be spicy according to the chili pepper listed next to it on the menu, but these were more sweet than spicy. Though they tasted great, if I come back, I don't know that I would order them again. I didn't really feel like I got a lot of meat out of them for the price.  While we were grubbing on our appetizers, our pho came as well. I ordered a large and it did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth. Wasn't salty and had a nice aroma too. There was just enough noodles and enough beef to satisfy me. I added plum sauce, 2 limes, sriracha sauce, bean sprouts and cilantro to mine. Hubby really liked his pho too.   All in all, we will definitely come back. The pho was great, serving staff was friendly and very attentive. It is just a great place to kick back and enjoy some tasty food...especially on a chilly, rainy day!",

Typically pad see ew tastes the same to me at all the Thai restaurants I've been to, but something about the sauce definitely tasted off here. It also took a while to come out, but that may have been because I requested tofu instead of meat. They were apologetic about the wait though.   Although I personally didn't have actual Vietnamese food, my friend tried the hu tieu and chicken wings, and wasn't impressed either.   *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.  5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.",

They are open 24/7 which is very convenient, especially for my mom who works graveyard shift.  We ordered spring rolls and crab rangoons for appetizers. They were both delicious and the presentation was pretty. All of us chose the beef combination pho, which seemed to be a popular choice as both of our neighboring tables ordered it as well. The pho was delicious and the portion was huge. It's easily shareable unless you have a big appetite.  I docked a star because even though this place is beautiful and the food was good, the service was lacking. Nobody checked on us throughout our meal and we were seated close to the register so I saw they messed up someone's order and weren't apologetic about it at all. That kind of rubbed me the wrong way.",

PKL Ambiance & Service:  Picture a small hole in the wall restaurant..and they keep getting more and more dining space without changing the ambiance or decor and this is the dining area. A majority of my visits have been in the early morning and have been all over the spectrum: Amazing, ok and horrid.  It all came down to the staff assigned to us. All my visits during the regular dining hours have been pretty good overall with no major issues.  The kitchen is pretty good with getting orders to the table quickly at all my visits.  PKL Pho and misc. dishes:  For $10 and under, you get a pretty big bowl of pho and I've always been a fan of their broth.  The pho noodles and beef are good and you get decent value overall for the quantity and quality.  The egg rolls and spring rolls are on par with a good casual Vietnamese restaurant and they are ordered for table on every visit.  We stick to the basics and PKL has delivered almost every time.  Pho restos have opened all over Vegas in the past 8 years and PKL now has lots of tough competition in the immediate vicinity.  They are still one of my classic late night eats place and they're tough to beat when it's early in the morning.  There's a reason they're still busy at that time.

I've never gotten food to go anywhere at any restaurant where the food took that long and I wasn't \"allowed\" to sit at one of 50+ empty chairs.",

    "text": "This place gets a lot of hype for low-par service and cold pho.    We were seated, greeted, and order taken and delivered very quickly (although, it's not that hard to ladle some broth and veggies in a bowl); so, I'll give them a star for that.    However, it was all down hill from here.    My pho was cold when it arrived; my daughter's was steaming hot.  It's the first time I ever ordered vegan pho so I thought maybe it was some hippie vegan thing to consume it cold?    I inquired with the waitress and it was definitely supposed to be hot. They took it back and it took forever for them to bring it back; to which, it appears all they did was microwave it bc all the bean sprouts and peppers I put on there, before I found out it was cold, were all in the same exact spots; obviously untouched.  But, whatever, I was hungry.    I take my second sip, and it's still not hot, warmer but definitely not steaming hot like it should be.    At that point, I just wanted to eat and not deal with the issue any more.     Like I said, it was my first vegan pho, but I didn't care for the veggies being raw and hard.  Maybe that's how it should be???? but I just don't want to crunch into a hard-@$$ veggies when I'm consuming soup.  I just ate the noodles and broth (which was really good, so I'll give them another star).    Then, continuing downhill, for whatever reason the busser kept putting the rolling cart to haul dirty dishes right next to us.  Maybe because I complained about my soup being cold?  Like, screw this lady and her whining @$$.   The cart was close enough each time she brought it by I barely had elbow room to eat.    She started just tossing (and I do mean tossing) dirty dishes on the to cart and slashing other people's half eaten food on me.  Apparently the disgusted look I gave her did nothing to discontinue to behavior.   The second time I got hit with food like I was at a Sea World show, I figured it was time to leave before I lost my shiz and was never permitted in any pho establishment within 100 miles.    I paid quickly in cash and left with my cold, crunchy soup.    My daughter liked hers though; she got the shrimp.",

I was starving and it was kind of chilly in Vegas that evening. I requested to have soup so after checking yelp, we headed to this popular place in Chinatown.  Place was busy but they have a pretty large dining area with lots of seating. We waited only a few minutes and we soon got seated. Service was fast, or should I say, way too fast. It's a delight watching them as the staff move so quickly with the service. They certainly got used to the busy routine here.   We ordered the following:  Crispy Calamari (With Salt & Pepper)- $11.95  Fried Chicken Wings (With Salt & Pepper)- $9.95  Fresh Spring Rolls (With Shrimp Pork & Lettuce) - $5.25  Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup - $8.75  Based on the stellar reviews, my expectations were high. Sadly, overall experience was underwhelming and kind of disappointing. Calamari was chewy while wings were a bit dry. Soup was good but I wished it had more flavor. Thank goodness, I liked the fresh spring rolls as the ingredients were fresh and dipping was tasty. Portions were generous though.",

Was charged 20% gratuity automatically, without my knowledge.   They do this for ALL diners and orders. Beware.    They have posted on the menu that gratuity is included for parties of 6 or more.   Last time I was here on July 22, 2019, a party of 5, I was charged ~18% gratuity automatically.  Furthermore, their gratuity guide is higher than 15% (closer to 18%)  Food is decent quality, but not as good as it was 4-5 years ago.    Crispy noodle isn't that crispy.

They used to have one of the best Bun Bo Hue in the area but, our latest visit had us really disappointed.  Our first stop, once we landed, was to come here to get breakfast and kill time before our check-in. The staff is friendly and quick to seat us but the delivery of what you order came out super slow (on a non-busy day). My friend and I ordered Bun Bo Hue and hers came out first and I had to wait for a good 8 to 10 minutes before mines came out (my order was the last to arrive, while the pho came out quickly).   The food:  If you stop by here definately get the pho as it's the best tasting dish. What I like about eating here is they hook you up with hella meat! The Hu Tieu came with a lot of seafood, pho dac biet with large amount of meat, and the bun bo hue with plenty of pork pieces and large soft pig feet. What this restaurant lacks is tripe!  The Bun bu Hue came out lukewarm at best. I believe the other broths also came out lukewarm and just didn't really cook the raw meat that well. The bun bo hue broth was bland and wasn't spicy at all. The flavor was definitely lacking this trip compared to all my other visits here. I added a whole bunch of paste to brighten up the flavor but, yeah... it just wasn't working out.   End food review",

At PKL their \"rare beef\" is served in the bowl of hot broth and not on the side thus no longer \"rare\" by the time they run the food to your table basically ruining the tasty, thinly cut, beef that is best when still pink.  Another big faux pas is the fact that their Special Combo has no tripe, no tendon and you have to pay for meatballs.   Then there is the wait...I am guessing most of these folks are tourists adventuring off the beaten path. Fine with me. They can have PKL.  Check out Pho Bosa for some stellar Pho and no wait.",

However, I think everyone else knows this too, so those days after clubbing when you're finally able to roll out of bed and your hunger finally outweighs your need to lay in bed and you think man I need some pho, best of luck to you on the wait situation. If you're lucky and it happens to be short, you are in luck! But I've seen the wait be up through 45 minutes before as well. Longest 45 minutes if you are already barely at the state of crawling out of bed. The restaurant is pretty big and has lots of tables and service is fast, it's just THAT many ppl want to get some.   PHO: The broth is very well made, this is pretty much the defining difference between pho restaurants and pho kim long is near the top of the list. I don't like it when place don't rinse the starch off their noodles and makes the broth cloudy, none of that here. Good portions of noodle and meat, yes! Also, no crazy obvious msg taste, here we go baby! Path to recovering so you can go hard again!  I used to take good pho for granted, but having experienced some bad ones lately, I really appreciate those that stay True to the craft!   LOCATION: If you are staying around the wynn/venetian side of the strip, you just go right across spring mountain a few blocks and you are in chinatown, not too far of a drive to get some tasty vietnamese beef broth in your system.",

First off, their Pho Dac Biet was bland with no flavour. It seems as if they underestimated their peak hour business and so they must have ran out of broth and created some lame pho base. I can tell because it was diluted and also growing up eating so much Pho, one can tell what the broth consists of.   Second day of dining, their dumpling broth was sour, meaning that this probably went bad. I turned it back and headed on over to Lee's sandwich for some edible food. Of course they credited the overall bill from a party of 12.  The only dish that looked appetising was their thit nuong cam tam. It looked very delicious from what my friend told me and also it tasted on par to normal thit nuong dishes here.  Would I come back? Probably not since Vegas is a hit or miss in terms of food.",

    "text": "I will give this restaurant credit...I had a long night with some good friends and stumbled in here at 7:00am looking for pho. That being said, the food/ service was a little haphazard.   I ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland.   The service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after. He failed to bring out my spring rolls and then hassled me when I asked to have my nonexistent spring rolls removed from the bill.   Kudos for them being open 24/7, but there are at least 5 better pho joints with .5 miles. Go there.",

Great for drunken stumbling groups or for just you and a homie/lover/friend. I've been here a good handful of times through a span of 4 years now -- typically when friends are visiting and while their food may not be the greatest Viet spot in Vegas, they make up in their hours and the variety of traditional Viet-Chinese pho and rice dishes. Upon a recent visit I met up with a group of friends that never been to a Vietnamese-Chinese spot and all of them for the most part enjoyed their food. For that they teeter along a 3 and 3.5 in my book but I prefer to round up and give these businesses the benefit of the doubt!",

I never got to writing the bad review they deserved because I always had hoped they would get better and alas they have. Personally, there was never anything wrong with the food here, their pho is as good as it gets. However, the main problem was their service. The servers here were slow, and VERY VERY RUDE. BUT, finally they have changed for the better. The servers were nicer, more attentive, and faster. The food actually got better too! The pho was plated beautifully and consistently. Very presentable and tasty food. THANK YOU FOR CHANGING PHO KIM LONG.",

    "text": "This review is based on an order to go while at the restaurant.  SERVICE - 1/2 ... FOR EFFORT? FOOD - 3  I was excited to try this place since I always see that the restaurant is packed. I guess it's one of those places where food is decent but service is lacking - they take their time. My friend and I walk up to the counter and was greeted by a hostess. We wanted to order to go and she took our order, said it would take 15-20 minutes. Sure, it's a Sunday evening, restaurant wasn't full but it was getting there. This was 9:10pm.   9:40pm rolls around. We've seen other people who ordered after us with orders fulfilled. So, we walk up to the counter further in where the register is at and talk to the guy behind the register who is clearly prepping orders to go and picking up phone orders. He says our order isn't in there; He can't find it. I clarified the hostess took down our order over half an hour ago, he calls her over, she says something in Vietnamese that, by the tone of it, she admitted she totally forgot. STRIKE 1. He apologizes to us and takes our order. which were repeated to him (once by my friend, second time by me just to make sure he has it), said it would be out in 10-15 minutes. Fine, I paid, wait again.   He walks over to hand us the food himself, again apologizing. We feel better, even though we were really hungry, as we felt he knew we deserved better service. We then check the food and there's an order missing, and a missing side rice. Checked the bag and we couldn't find the order receipt. We approach him and he says we didn't order what we claim are missing. He prints out our order receipt and shows us. Clearly, he didn't add them in. STRIKE 2. We make another payment.  It was really hard to enjoy the food after dealing with this kind of service but by this time I was so hungry I ate up the whole thing. Food was decent, but I can't say it was great. I will make an effort to give this restaurant another chance and hopefully I can follow up to this with a more positive review and not a Strike 3. Nonetheless, It was a very disappointing night.",

It's Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and, yes Filipino restaurants.  For me, it was a dream come True.  Pho Kim Long was the first lit Pho restaurant we saw so we veered left and parked.  I was expecting some hole in the wall place as most Asian restaurants are when clustered together.  What we got was a CLEAN, yes I said CLEAN and modern looking Pho place.  The food was excellent.  Their Vermicellii was super fresh and so was the Pho.  And, they are open til 3 am in the morning! Then again, what places in Vegas aren't open that late or even 24 hours, right?  Bottom line, for this Asian---it gets good ratings. --fresh food, clean restaurant, friendly service.  No wonder this place is packed. Plus, they do take out.  And lemme tell you, when you're craving hot soup in 112 degree weather in Vegas at 11 pm, this is where you wanna take out from.",

My friends and I had breakfast here,and ordered the pho dac biet and bun tit nuong. One friend wanted the pho ga as well as the pho dac biet, so she ended up asking if she could have the pho dac biet with the tit ga in it and they were more than obliged to do so! My other friend ordered the bun tit nuong but they gave her chicken instead of the beef. My friend not being so picky ended up eating the dish, which turned out to be pretty good.  The table adjacent to us ended up getting her dish instead. The waiters knew they made a mistake as did we and surprisingly acknowledged their mistake, which is always great and rare for any pho restaurant to do. Good thing we're not picky eaters, plus we were on a time crunch so we were more interested in eating and going.  Our food came with a good amount of meat so it turned out to be very filling.  I do believe the dishes are priced a little high but since I did not see too many other pho restaurants I guess competition is scarce.  All in all a good place for Vietnamese food, almost like home cooking.  I enjoy eating off the Vegas strip.",

Once seated, the waiters taking our order did not seem happy with their job but we were still okay with the service. We paid our bill and left a GENEROUS tip due to the large party. The HORRIBLE part was on the way out. My husband was carrying my son out first (while the rest of the party was gathering their belongings) when a waiter said to him in a very rude way, \"Move out of the way\". Come on now, you can at least say excuse me. That was the final straw for my husband, he told the waiter that he was extremely rude, and he would like to speak to the owner of the establishment. Turns out he was the son of the owner and the owner was not there. We asked for his dad's number so we can call him but he of course wouldn't give it to us. We probably would have been okay if he had just apologized and said he was in a rush or something but he didn't seem to care. I guess if the son of the owner doesn't care about how he treats the customers, there's no reason for the other workers to care either! Needless to say, we won't be going back.",

Pho, vermicelli, egg rolls, you name it.. they all did the trick, and we were ready to party again when we finished.

She would not sit us (13 people) at the tables which could fit us in. Instead, she would split us into 2 small tables where they could only fit 10. When we questioned about it, she went on and on like we, customer, must follow her bad lead. She talked to her manager. Finally, the manager could sit us in the tables which she hid it for other guests. Afterwards, I saw her talking about that to other staffs and they both laughed at it.   I don't understand how the owner would not care about his/her restaurant and hire such bad staffs.  When one works in the restaurant, he/she should satisfy the customers to have great tips. Now I'm holding back on my tips.",

The bowls came out very quickly. The summer rolls were perfect, crisp and tasty! You have to wrap the lettuce around it and dip it in the fish sauce!!!! When the pho came out we barely spoke with each other! Haha unfortunately the spring rolls didn't come out which made us sad... and the waiter forgot to bring us water. We ultimately cancelled the spring rolls. The food was good thats all that really mattered! If you're in vegas and want some good hangover food come here!",

The flavor has been okay every time I come back and with appetizers being ordered that taste kind of bland, it doesn't allow me to give more stars.  The broth is what makes the soup. The noodles are basically the same at every pho spot. The added protein, white onions, green onions, thai basil, lime and sprouts are all additions to the pho. The broth flavor has to define itself and that's how I decide which place is better than another and it's just okay over here. Actually better when you're super faded - lol!  I love the customer service here as they are super fast, very attentive and want to make you happy so you come back.  Anyways... I always end up coming back but it's definitely not my favorite.",

We were all hungry and when we went in we were told that they couldnt accommodate such a large group at one table which was expected, the server led us to one table which fit about 12 of us. The original server also gave us another smaller table next to us to squeeze into which was somewhat doable but then the guy behind the counter was telling the server no no no, to not put us there. So they moved the rest of us 13 people on to a small rectangular table that could barely fit 8 and told us we could squeeze and that we would fit... we could not fit. We asked the guy why we couldnt have the round table and he said he had other customers. We ended up spending about $ 300. First off it was not that busy, secondly there was a bunch of tables open in the back. We complained and ended up getting the round table as well and that just fit us perfectly. All of this took about 15 min just to sit, and we were hungry.  The servers were rude. the food was just okay, we definitely will not be coming back. Theres other places that are better with better customer service. Only reason i gave it another star was because the food came out fast.",

Until I checked out.  We paid in cash and I brought it up to the register. Instead of giving me the change to leave a tip on the table the cashier was very pushy about what I wanted to leave and leave it with him. The tip amounts were uneven numbers but the middle one 18% was a nice rounded number 5.25 I said that'll work. When he gave me my change back it was wrong. I didn't want to argue with the man at this point so I just let him have it. It was super uncomfortable being pushed as if I wasn't going to leave a tip or something.",

There are other food items I would like to try during my next visit to Las Vegas.  The prices seem to be a bit higher but that's expected when you have a 24 hour pho restaurant that is in Las Vegas. I would definitely pay extra to get my pho fix in the middle of the night.   The service was average but I don't expect GREAT service from Asian restaurants. I am mainly there for the food.

Coming off of the best pho I've ever had at Vietnamese Central in Westminster, Orange County, CA...  this place was flavorful, but not AMAZING.  [=THE 411=] I'm assuming if you're a visitor, you'll come here either for cheap lunch or for a late-night, post-clubbing chow-down.  I think this place will do it for either one -- as long as you're craving pho.  [=SERVICE/WAIT=] We came in with a group of 10 for a late-ish lunch.  Parking wasn't too hard, even though the lot was pretty full.  They seemed pretty busy too, but we only had to wait 5 minutes or so to get seated, so that was surprising.  Waters came out quickly, so OK on the service.  [=THE FOOD: PHO=] Pho is definitely the thing to get -- cheapest for the most food.  I had one of the pho with three cuts of meat.  It was a little salty and I wish they had more noodles, but no other complaints.  I wish they had given more bean sprouts and basil for our large group, but I'm sure we could have asked and they would have gladly obliged.  [=VERDICT=] I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here next time I visit Vegas unless I was specifically craving pho -- but chances are, I'll get something better/more expensive, or cheaper/closer.  If you're only visiting Vegas for a few days...  why get something you can get anywhere else?",

The meat came out medium rare, just enough so I could dunk it under the noodles to let it cook a little before consuming.  They definitely want you in and out.  A few people wanted to take our order and before we could finish we were asked if we were done and the check was coming.  Maybe the other dishes were good, but when they say Pho, the first item I would go for is the Pho Tai.",

I may give it one more chance and order something different. Soups weren't anything spectacular. I'll stick to Pho So 1 for my pho fix.",

I remember everyone's food was pretty good. Decent prices, definitely cheaper than any mediocre Vietnamese food on the strip. About $7 for a bowl of Pho or any noodle soup.  I got the Combination Noodle Soup with both Rice Noodle and Yellow Egg Noodle. Holy crap!! The soup was delicious! Very good broth and tasted pretty darn close to perfection.  Also, the decor and interior of this restaurant is extremely clean and modern looking. One of the most appealing Vietnamese/Pho restaurants I've ever been to.",

Considering it's the only Pho place I have been to in Vegas, maybe I'm just too spoiled coming from SoCal where there's Pho places everywhere.  The broth had a different taste to it...and it was much heavier.. more msg?  The noodles weren't as soft (even after letting it soak in the broth for a while). The meat was okay, but there were pieces that did not look appealing.  The service was okay, they were nice.  They were very quick in seating 9 of us, but took forever in coming back to take our orders..We had to flag them down.  Also, they seemed a bit hasty in clearing our plates (maybe they were running low?).  It can be kinda awkward..especially when I'm still eating and they're trying to take my food away... Overall, it was okay.",

Ive been many times and my experiences range from awful, to mediocre, to fantastic.  Pricing is really not that bad.       Service ranges just like the food...sometimes its terrible, and sometimes its great. I do agree with a few of the other posters in regards to asian customers seem to get better treatment and food. And i say this with the most confidence and its my friends family who owns the place and I've been with there, with her, and other family members, and we got NO discount or any other special treatment.    Also, this place plays no games. I've seen many people kicked out of the restaurant. You too drunk? Goodbye! Your too loud? Goodbye! Rude? Sleeping at table? Taking forever to eat? Goodbye!        Parking sucks and the place stays busy. 24 hour restaurant. Some of the best Pho I've had has been here as well as some of the worst.        I'd highly recommend this place when all is said and done. Its hard to beat a place that is close to the strip, thats 24 hours. If you 10 times, you will enjoy at least 5 of those trips....but thats expected at places like this that stay this busy all the time.",

Most dishes are prepared quite well. My boyfriend loves their pho, but I am not a huge fan. It's not bad, it's just not authentic. It tastes as if they didn't have time to allow all the flavors of the star anise and herbs to get pulled into the broth itself. Probably because of their high rate of table turns. All in all, great food though... available 24 hours which is a huge plus. The only reason I only give them 4 stars is because they lack customer service and caring for their patrons. They seem to be so busy, that they just want you to eat and get the hell out. Lol! I guess I can't blame them... to go is always a great option if you're looking for quality food fast with no customer service. It's probably best to get to go so you don't get offended or upset by their service.",

Their salt and pepper fish is also to die for, it's honestly one of my favorite things to eat just in general from anywhere. Only downfall of this place I would have to say is that their service is pretty iffy. Sometimes it's on point and I have no complaints but other times, even when it's not very busy people tend to ignore you and it seems you're being over looked by everyone working there. It's quite frustrating and makes me second guess this place every now and again. But still I do enjoy it when they get everything right, which they usually do.",

The chow mien is one dish they really screwed up, the crunchy noodles came out too soft and the sauce was too bland. They tainted my palate for one of my favorites.

The one star rating is because the waitress demanded more tip money. The bill had came and I paid with tip and placed the money on the tray which accompanied the bill. The waitress came by to pick up the bill and when she saw the tip amount she told me \"This is how much 15% tip would be.\"  I told her I'm giving you 10% because that's what I believe you deserve. Mind you, I'm not cheap and I often tip up to 30% if the service warrants it. In this case it did not. My family and I were all so shocked that she demanded more tip. This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I believe that once a business gets established and has a lot of customers they tend to take customers for granted. We will never ever ever go back. Maybe they thought they were the only Pho store in town. There's like another five to ten Pho store within a one mile radius that we will rather go to next time we are in Vegas. Btw, I'm not the only one complaining about the tips. There's other reviews also.",

Nice flowers and fish tanks - First ever Viet restaurant where a non-Asian was our waiter. Not saying its bad, but I appreciate the diversity! haha - Living in SoCal, the pho is pretty darn expensive. But compared to SanJo, it's a bit comparable. $8ish for a reg bowl of pho. - Pho was great. Not bland, not too salty. Beef was tender. Pretty comparable to the other Viet restaurants around the area.  - Average tasting egg rolls. Crispy. pretty thick.  - They serve food other than Viet. I'd be a bit pessimistic trying it. Pad Thai? I think I'll stick to a Thai restuarant.  - Seasoned rice and chicken was delicious. Chicken was cooked well and crispy. Excellent flavoring for the rice. You don't need extra sauce to taste any flavor. Perfect!  - Service was good. No complaints.  - To call it the best, I'd have to disagree. But the presentation is a lot better than many other Viet restaurants. Great place to introduce your non-Asian friends to Viet cuisine.",

    "text": "During my college years, or at least those years I was 21+, I made several late night/early morning trips to Pho Kim Long.  Sometimes it was to feed post-clubbing munchies and at other times it was to nurse a post clubbing hangover.  Pho Kim Long was always one of the first Pho restaurants that popped up on Yelp when you searched it and in my less than 100% state I remember thinking it as pretty good.  But now that I'm a little bit older, wiser, and more sober when I eating here, it is more like 2.5 stars (I rounded up for the good blurry memories).  A bowl of Pho is right around 7.50 which isn't cheap or crazy expensive.  You can pretty much order any combination of rare beef, tripe, tendon, meatball, etc. that suites your fancy.  They give you a very average portion of everything.  One of the things that stops me from giving them more stars is their broth.  I feel that it is all about the broth; it is what makes or breaks a bowl of Pho.  I just don't find their broth to have very much flavor like other places.  Another reason why I can't justify giving them more stars is because their service is on the slow side.  I've been there on more than one occasion and even though they have lots of room and should have figured out a way to handle to their customer flow, I still always find myself waiting for really long periods of time for my food.  I don't really order anything fancier than a bowl of Pho so it shouldn't take that long.  I'm sorry Pho Kim Long. I want to like you more because of our history, but you are just another average Pho Joint and nothing special in my mind.",

    "text": "I am so disgusted ...  I am pretty sure that they have changed management because the old manager would never have let this happen or treated his customers thus. I would give this place 0 stars but it will not let me.  I have been coming here for at least 10 years and sometimes 3xs a week and I can't tell tell you how grossed out I am.    Let's start off with the dirty sticky tables and dirty silverware, which had food stuck on it.  That should have been my cue to get up and go somewhere else.  First off I ordered the special fried egg rolls and they tasted rancid and cold, so they remade it and they tasted like the old ones were thrown back into the fryer and served back to us. Then I took a bite of the chicken teriyaki that I ordered for my 3 year old son and it tasted slimy and cold in the middle, I took apart 5 or 6 pieces and they were all clear and pink in the middle, so I ate RAW chicken .  I told the waitress and then her manager approached the table and when I told him that the chicken was raw his response was \"you don't know what you talk about chicken is pink\" at this point I didn't feel like arguing with anyone so I paid for my 3 young coconuts and my Thai boba totaling in $22.49 and left (yes I left the poor waitress her 20% tip bc it's not her fault that they hired cooks that do not know that chicken needs to have an internal temp of 165 degrees)   I would skip this filth ridden place and I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up in dirty dinning soon.",

    "text": "I cant believe im just now writing this review. I was really sick, when i came here with my best friend so i wanted some Pho. I ordered the large and of course ate none of it. So i asked the lady who was serving us if she would box it up. I wish at this moment i would've been recording her. She proceeds to put my food in the containers and we were watching her. She drops one of my shrimps on the table. So she looks at me and says \"that's okay\" I'm looking at her and  nodding my head yes thinking she's asking me if that's okay if she dropped one of my shrimps on the table. No, i was wrong. After I shake my head yeah, she picks the shrimp up off the table with here BARE hands and puts it in my to-go container with the rest of my food. I couldn't believe what I had seen, that was disgusting and unsanitary. I didn't even have the energy to argue with her about it. Common sense you don't do that because I don't know where her hands had been and if they had cleaned the table. That food went straight in the trash. I will NEVER eat at this establishment again and I will warn all my family and friends. I'm surprised this place hasn't been on dirty dining yet.",

I'm sure other groups who have been out all night go here for the same reason. There are plenty of seats and we didn't need to wait long to get seated.  Both nights I came here, I had pho with briskets in it. I think it was #15? I'll have to double check. The portion wasn't too big, and I had more meat than noodles the first time I came here, which is fine but I'm someone who likes equal ratios of meat and noodles. It was pretty good, but just in general I don't like the water in Las Vegas, which didn't make this the best pho for me and I always feel queasy when I drink water outside of where I live, but it did its job of feeding me.  Overall I had pretty good service, food came out fast and the dishes itself were pretty good. I would still come here again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Hopefully I won't feel too bad from drinking Vegas water next time.",

Pho Kim Long is located off the strip in Chinatown area of Las Vegas. Very popular late night spot for locals and frequent visitors. If you're craving pho, this is the spot to get it at!  Extremely reasonable prices for the food (very cheap compared to the Strip!) and good sized portions. Pretty much every dish is under $10.  As far as the quality goes, its pretty good! i'm from San Jose so I'm pretty familiar with Vietnamese food, and Pho Kim Long can hold it's own. No complaints with the pho, rice plates, or vercimelli bowls!  Only downfall is that it gets super busy around 3am. So if you're super wasted and don't have the patience (or ability lol) to sit around and wait, I would look for other options.But other then that, this is one of my favorite off-strip joints in Vegas!",

I absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks?   Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down?   And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapenos, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha.   And I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour.   It's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town.   All in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, Pho Kim Long did not meet my expectations that I was hoping for.  The service was pretty good. Our server tended to our requests in a timely manner and did what we asked. The food came out on time, too. However, the quality of the food was mediocre at best.  I started with the fried calamari. It was drenched in salt. All I could taste was salt. I was a little \"salty\" when they did this. The plate also had shells of fried batter that did not have calamari. In fact, half of the plate was fried calamari and the other half was fried batter. This plate is probably for people who REALLY enjoy salty foods and have a small craving for calamari.  Now, onto the entree, the pho. I ordered the Pho Tai (rare thinly cut beef) Bo Vien (meat balls). The broth and noodles were average; they did not have me jumping out of my seat because it was delicious nor did it have me throwing up because it was awful. The Tai, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was what I expected it to be, easy to chew and flavorful with the hoisin and Sriracha sauces. I wish I could say the same about the Bo Vien. They were the worst meat balls I have ever had at a vietnamese restaurant. I ate one meat ball and put the rest of the meat balls on a separate dish to be thrown out later. It seemed like the meat was processed with plastic. It had no consistency and quickly broke in your mouth without even chewing. It was absolutely disgusting.  As a final thought, I think you would be best trying something else other than the Pho Bo Vien.",

The biggest disappointment this time was the chicken fried rice.  There was hardly any chicken and very bland.  Not sure if it was because it was 2:30am and they ran out or not.  But other than that, a good place to get your late night fix.",

What I saw was poor service and dirty tables, as far as the food, Pho was served cold and the broth was made in a hurry for a quick serve.  Here is my suggestion to the managers there, if the food is not ready to serve then do NOT serve it, simply let the customers know, everyone understands that.  Our pho took nearly 25 minutes to come and the waiter was extremely RUDE.  My family for sure won't return here and my guess is that all the reviews on yelp are being paid for.  Not even a 1 star.",

All dishes that we have tried are very affordable in price and even more generous in servings. We have enjoyed most of the dishes they have served us.   The usual night hostess is very sweet and helpful, always taking drink orders and actually paying attention to the patrons. I remember when she went out of her way to bring me my soda when our server forgot about it, very awesome.  Speaking of the service, it's sub-par really. Most of the servers we have received don't check on us often, let the glasses go empty for awhile, or don't seem interested in ensuring great service. Being a manager at a restaurant on the strip I have high standards, however I realize that not every business is like mine, and I can't judge other servers too much.  Food, amazing. Atmosphere, very casual. Hours, amazing, 24 hours. Go. Eat. Now!",

So we went in and I could see they decorated this place pretty well. But the line had like 70 people in there (well, at least my mom said so). We waited, because Asians cannot go a week without some Pho or rice. When we got to our table, it was a little sticky (well, almost ALL pho restaurants have those) but we didn't care.   The pho was a little pricy, but they came out fabulous! Totally worth your money. It's not like Pho Kim Long is the Gucci of pho places, but definitely it's great. Pour some of dat Sriracha and hoisin sauce into your big bowl of pho, add some bean sprouts and jalapeno, and squeeze in some of dat lime. Delishussss.   Okay, maybe the service was a little slow, but this is the only good and authentic pho place in town. And how to know the pho is authentic? The broth must have this layer of fat on top, but it's no big deal. I mean, if you have never tried pho before, shame on you. As I said before, delishussss.  And parking...meh. Service...meh. Forgets orders...meh. Those things made this a four star review. But still good though.",

He was so rude asking what I ordered when I clearly did not know the exact numbers for my table. He ended up getting mad at ME because HE couldn't find my check. He couldn't even walk a couple steps for me to show him what table I was at. I honestly wouldve gave this place no stars, but then it wouldn't have let me write a review.",

Servers usually just come to your table, take order and you won't see them again until they drop your check (unless u wave them down while they help their other 15tables).

Pho and vermicelli noodles were delicious. I think their prices are a little higher though compared to other places now that they have become well known. :)",

They took forever to just to ask us what to drink( they are not busy at all). I got their beef stew noodle soup, spring roll, beef broccoli, the soup and beef broccoli was way too salty and had way too much MSG in it. Sorry to say the only decent thing was their egg roll sauce! We paid our check and tipped 20% and leave. Anyway we wouldn't eat here again!",

Surprisingly the place was filled with a bunch of families, not hungover partiers that I expected.    The pho selection is surprisingly small but you can customize it by requesting add-ons. I got a #15 and added tendon The pho came out quite quickly but somehow they made a mistake on half our orders. I got a large bowl of pho with no tendon at all even though I requested a small. They said that add-ons automatically upgrades it to a large which I wasn't even told. However when I looked inside the bowl, there wasn't even any tendon! I'm fairly sure they messed up my order and forced me to take a large. They finally came by with some tendon after multiple requests and it was terrible. The tendon was chewy, hard and tasted like cardboard...one of the worst tendon pieces I've ever had.   My friends said this is one of the best in Vegas but if this is the best...I don't want to know what's the worse. The soup was bland and flavorless. The only saving grace was the huge amount of meat. I am still not sure why this place is so popular, maybe people are looking at the yelp ratings only? I would recommend you to consider other pho options in Vegas instead of coming here.",

I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible \"management\" skills from their \"manager\". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said \"We don't do split checks.\"   *Sidenote* I have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle.   I told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, \"Thats impossible, not without my approval\". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void.   NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR FOOD ON THE STRIP LATE AT NIGHT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY BETTER OFF AT SOME GREASY DRIVE THRU THAN PHO KIM LONG.",

But BOY, their pho is the best. Their broth is really what makes it. I always order either the #14, with just rare steak, or #15, rare steak and brisket. Other than the pho I love the tradition fried eggrolls. This is the best spot to go to for your hangover cue after a late night around town because it's 24 hours.  They also have extremely fast service which makes waiting for a table go by faster. The restaurant is quite large, so there are always people leaving, opening up new tables quickly. The only time I thought this was a negative thing was when I was unsure of what I wanted and the waitress kept coming to the table for my order. If I timed it in between she came back every 20-30 seconds to ask. Now that I have been here a lot, I know my go-to order, so it isn't a problem anymore, but for newbies, this can put a lot of pressure on them. It makes sense though. Lots of hungry guests at the door, they'd want people in and out so they don't lose any customers who can look at the menu as they wait for their seat.",

    "text": "Finally decided to check this place out on recent layover in Vegas. Pho kim long is located right in the Chinatown area. It's very nice location with parking available. Parking can be difficult to come across, but it ain't too bad, especially during lunch area.   I always get the Combo pho dat biet wherever I go. It has beef balls, rare steak, beef brisket, tripe, etc... I love all the meats and soup broth was pretty good. Not terribly expensive, it cost like just under $9 bucks for the large. I didn't even know there was a small and large version. My girlfriend ordered the pho with just rare steak and it was a small size. We didn't specify which we wanted.  I would definitely come back for more, especially that it's open 24/7. Can't get better than that in Vegas.",

My parents and I came in late Friday night as we just touched down in Vegas and picked up the rental. We waited about 5 - 10 min to get a table at about 10pm.   The restaurant was full and seemed like everyone was enjoying. We wanted some comfort food prior to checking into the hotel and resting. My parents both ordered the pho dac biet and I got the thit nuong rice plate with egg cake and a fried egg. It took a bit for the food to come out and for some reason I got my rice plate before they got their pho.   All of the waiters seemed to be guys. They were pretty busy so I had to flag some down for things but everyone was really helpful. I tried to come back during lunch on Sunday but the wait was too long. Will come visit again next time I am in Vegas.",

Actually after that other place we tried nearby, this place is pretty darn good indeed.  And they open super late so if you're looking for a midnight snack after some major walking or club hopping on the Strip, this is the place to come to.  The place is fairly new and clean, nicely decorated, fish tank with variety of saltwater fish, has plenty of large tables for bigger groups and the food is served fast.  Dishes are nicely presented and are good size portions.  We tried the pho, rice plates like grilled pork chop, and some other chinese dishes (tofu, vege., fish).  Located in the plaza by the Ranch 99.  I'd definitely come back when staying in LV.",

Can I have a few minutes does not translate into \"come back in a nano second\".   Com tam and pho here is pretty decent, as well as their chicken wings.

The broth was tasty, the proteins were good (I forgot what I ordered) and the serving size was also good.  I guess my issue when I went there was that whenever the wait staff would give me my beverage or check, it was placed at the end of the table away from me, which I found to be unusual.  For example, since I ate lunch by myself, I had a single table that seats only two people.  The bev/check was actually placed at arm's length.  Is that a Viet thing?  I'm pretty sure it was the wait staff's perceived issue with me.  But, as I mentioned before, I'm moving to LV soon and willing to give these folks another go.  Love Asian food, being Asian myself, and would really hate to not come here because I perceive some kind of issue or displeasure with me.",

I got the shaken beef with white rice for $10.  Pretty good.  I do not reccomend their bun bo hue: the meat had no flavor, it's kinda grey, as if it was merely boiled in water.  The chili does come separate though if you can't handle spiciness.  The pho was decent, it has the strong anise star aroma.  An order of eggrolls included 4 of them with veggies.  I'm not sure what the price was but they were small fast food type eggrolls.  If you eat here i recommend trying to be seated in the separate bar/lounge room.  It's less noisy and secluded from the hussle and bussle of the main room.  However service is kinda lacking in this room as well.",

The pho broth was the best ive ever had! it was clean, not to oily, not too clear but legit just right. I always order my pho with steak & brisket inside and this only enhanced the broth!

    "text": "Aside from the front parking space being empty... When we got there...my friend and I noticed how quite & empty the restaurant was for a Friday afternoon compared to a long waiting list.  We have also noticed that their Pho quality has gone bad. Their broth was warm and not hot as it should be; the soup was not authentic as it used to be either.   Last of all, the brown rice was served spoiled and sprinkled with little black insects which my friend thought it was just part of the rice but it had its wings & little legs that was too consistent for it to be a seed of the rice.    There was no apology from the management. We payed for our meals and won't be coming back since the quality of the food has gone down tremendously.",

    "text": "Warning: Their pho quality has declined. I suggest finding a different spot.   We used to come here each time we visited Las Vegas, but stopped coming to this place a few years ago. Now we know why. Ordered their large combo pho, since it only comes in large and their chicken pho. Both with rice noodles.   The bowls of pho came out quite fast, like within 5-7 minutes of ordering. The broth is warm but it's not hot where usually a lot of pho restaurants serve it as, so then the broth will stay warm throughout the time your eating. A few bites in we realized the broth was just off. The beef broth was okay, but it was lacking the homemade beef broth. The chicken broth was a mild saltiness to it but didn't taste like chicken to me. The rice noodles tasted a little odd to me like a dry taste.   We asked for steamed bean sprouts and those cake out quite fast. The bean sprouts were warm but we could tell it was not steamed for long, maybe ran through hot warm for a moment only.   They only had four other tables to serve at 9 am when we got there. I honestly will not return and suggest you don't either.",

He couldn't say enough nice things about the restaurant, the employees there in, and especially the food!  So I found myself looking for something great to eat and recall the conversation I had with the driver, so this is the place for me! I flipped through the Yelp app and found two of my favorite things; chicken spring rolls and hot and sour soup. So of course I had to order both!  The spring rolls come out and they are like heaven! Perfectly crispy on the outside, and the insides are packed with flavor. The hot and sour soup arrive shortly there after, and it is on the money!  So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes",

Great pho (broth soup, with veggie; some have meat); spring rolls, pot stickers and . They have the boba of your choice either in tia tea or in a smoothie. The service was quick and friendly. The table was kept clean and we were frequently checked on. Most of us had a lot of left overs to take home. Portions are pretty big just a FYI. Overall, wonderful experience of enjoying pho soup and a co worker bonding.",

First of all, as we waited for our table, the host/waiter was not very friendly, no smile, no greeting.   After we were seated, asked for a high chair and received no acknowledgement of the request and then ended up locating one ourselves.     After waiting about 10 minutes, the waiter brought our glasses of water then we waited about another 10 minutes to flag a waiter to place our order.    When the food finally arrived at the table one of the dishes was incorrect.  Despite the poor service the food is still good.   They have a very extensive menu with Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.     The restaurant is located in a very busy strip mall so parking is hard to find and may take a couple trips around.",

    "text": "My family and I are in Vegas for the MVA finale (dance competition) to support my niece when we decide one day to have Vietnamese food. This restaurant showed up on my search and it had ok reviews so we decided to give it a try. The first thing I noticed is the chaos and the rudeness of the employees that should've been a queue to leave.   As we were waiting for them to get our orders, I went ahead to use their restroom. It was so filthy. There were feces on the both of the toilet and papers were on the floor as well as diapers. I've always had this rule that if the restroom of a restaurant  (room seen in public eyes) are dirty, what do you think the kitchen looks (not seen by customers) like? Is it hard to designate someone to check on the restrooms every so often making sure it's still up to the standards? Wow is all I can say.   Took them 15-20 minutes to take our orders and when it finally came it was a disappointment. The kids ordered the wonton noodle soup. According to them the wonton tasted so bad especially the after taste so they only ate the noodles. It had this awful taste that can't explain (not real meat for sure). I ordered the grilled chicken plate combo, but when it came to my table it looked like a roasted quail. It was just ok. I was more grossed out. There's this very odd smell to their food. Needless to say that was a waste of $138 of food because none of us really ate. We had 3 adults, 3 kids.   This place is in China town. There's plenty of place to eat around here please try to find another restaurant before coming here. I'm not sure why they have so many customers for a place that's so filthy (beyond filthy), over priced, and rude. I will never come back to this place again and will NOT recommend it to anyone.",

I can understand that this is the best thing after a night of drinking cuz one would be sooooooo hungover &once that broth hits the tip of the tongue of someone who's super dehydrated - then yeahhhhh this would be 5 stars to someone in that situation. Lol. But the broth is not that great.   These are my top favorite pho places that I would recommend to someone who is on the hunt for some good 4-5 stars worthy Pho:   Pho King Vietnamese (on Eastern Ave in Henderson) Pho Saigon 8 (on Eastern Ave in Henderson)    Pho Kim long has a ridiculously long wait line for no reason. Again, I don't understand why this place would have such a long wait line: pho is usually serviced out super fast and again, the food is not that great. The broth didn't have the oomph for me and it lacked a lot of beef flavor. Even after adding lime, jalapeno, and chili paste - it's not that good. The rare steak and brisket was dry and lacked flavor. Not my favorite at all.  This is just my opinion. *wink.",

I also saw spring rolled and they looked awesome, they tasted good too ...  soup was great, very flavorful... I just didn't like mixed meat! It was too much cartilage and maybe that is how it gets great flavor but I didn't like it. Noodles were soft and great too. Next time I wanna try some other stuff coz it looks great.

We waited quite a long time to be seated and for our food to arrive, not to mention that the restaurant was practically empty at 1AM.   Came here again last week before heading back to Los Angeles, they brought out our Bun Rieu but not the other 3 pho. 10-15 minutes after the bun rieu, lady came to us apologizing and that our pho will arrive shortly. THEY FORGOT OUR PHO.   As a vietnamese and working in an area full of pho stores, the pho here is definitely average. I can't really taste much pho or beef flavor in the broth. Overall, it is ok.",

    "text": "I'm disappointed in the quality this place provided. I came recently with a large group and while majority of our party's meals were decent my dish was very subpar.   In particular, I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Absolutely love this dish and have ordered it hundreds of times elsewhere so would say I'm pretty familiar with the dish. When my order came around it did not have any spices in it. As a dish that is supposed to be spicy, it was not only a let down but confusing.   After asking the staff if the correct dish was served they took it back and added chili oil to it. After that I gave up because we already waited about 20 minutes for our food to be served. I didn't think the dish could fail any more past not being a True Bun Bo Hue dish with pork broth vs beef broth. It already lacked any sense of the spicy and balanced flavors I've come to love to Bun Bo Hue. Even so, I managed to find some faults with the dish.  After going through most of the toppings, I made my way to the pig's feet. I'm usually not disgusted but this was the first time I've experienced the hairs not properly cleaned off the foot. Suffice to say after that I cannot recommend this place to anybody. The quality of the food was subpar and the dish itself was not Bun Bo Hue.   The only saving grace would be their chicken wings which isn't really enough for me to justify coming back. The wings were about the width of a quarter with very little meat on them.   TL;DR Bun Bo Hue wasn't made correctly and the pig's foot had hair but their chicken wings were decent",

Serving size is enough for multiple people but I always refuse to share mine! The meats are amazing. Best broth by far I have found in a long time. Spring rolls and many other items are always great too. Lets be real we go for  the PHO. Staff is fast. Don't expect to chit chat but they will answer questions if you cant pick out food. Come when its busy? They have a fast turn around! Dont be surprised by lines waiting out the door... trust me worth the wait!!",

Not much authentic drinks to pick from just soda lemon but no sugar cane or penny worth. Very fast service and very popping. Highly recommend",

I came here unsure of what to expect after going to so many other pho restaurants (I'm still trying to find a favorite location). When they first brought out the plate with the sprouts and other additions to the pho as you can see from the pics the sprouts didn't look very fresh, and the spring rolls were alright. There was one tiny piece of lime and barely any basil on the plate with the sprouts as well. I didn't let this discourage me, maybe just off to a bad start.   Then the pho came out. I don't really like onions but I don't mind the yellow onions that normally come In pho because they are cooked and the flavor isn't overpowering. However, here they use red onions and they use A LOT of them. I wish I would've know prior to ordering. I removed all the onions (which was a process) and then was able to fix it up a bit and eat. The pho was decent, more onion flavored than I like but not intolerable. I probably wouldn't go there again personally but it wasn't a completely horrible experience.",

Thank goodness, Pho Kim Long was not far from our Strip hotel, and despite the fullness of the parking lot and the dozen or so people waiting ahead of us, we were seated within a few minutes, ordered immediately, and received our steaming bowls of pho very quickly, with a smile, and with a return visit to bring more water and see how we were doing a few minutes after that.  One of the things I loved was that they gladly made me a pho that wasn't on the menu:  my favorite combination of chicken and shrimp.  Some places won't do that at all, and others skimp on one or the other.  Not here; both the chicken and the shrimp were bountiful.  They also didn't balk when we asked for extra jalapeno.  In addition, the decor of the place is very appealing, with none of that garish lighting and wretched music that plagues too many Oriental restaurants.  My only criticism is that the restroom could've been cleaner and could use some mirrors over the lavatories.  Overall, though, I loved it and will return.",

Great Mongolian Beef, Pho, crispy pork, fresh veggies.   The price is right and the portion are HUGE.",

Even for not walking in here for a month or so, they still remember who I am and what I love to order!  Super friendly and fast service. The servers always know that I like to order the pan-fried noodles, orange chicken, salt n pepper pork chops, steam rice and a side of the pho broth!!! Like I said, my favorite restaurant away from home (San Francisco).   It's a very clean and modern decor inside the restaurant. Nothing that you can complain about, especially I'm so used to the restaurants in the Chinatown area in San Francisco - this place seems upscale! On the side note, I have been to a few other chinese restaurants here in LV, but haven't found a place that beats Pho Kim Long. I think they beat all other competition since they are open 24hrs a day! Got that hangover, no problem have some pho and a coconut and rest it off... LOL   This is a short taxi cab ride away if you are staying on the strip, and if you have a rental car, super easy to get to! Don't be surprise to see the security guard at the door during late night hours...lol he's super friendly and cool once you get to converse with him a few times going there!",

Tender beef cubes with a lot of flavor and very satisfying. Prices weren't too bad & they are open late so after drinks it's a great choice. I will definitely be back soon to experiment with more menu items, but that beef dish is worth the price of admission on it's own :)",

And for the past many years, Kim Long was our choice... mainly for their wide selection of dishes and above average taste quality.  However, the past few times we have visited have proved that management has certainly taken over by greed and the need to increase prices and diminishing food quality and services.  My experience here in our latest visit was completely unpleasant as the food tasted washed down and flavorless.  It's as if the chef had to rush out so many dishes that he forgets to throw in any key ingredients.  On top of that, service was horrible to say the least.  We asked for a tea refill from 4 different servers and each and every single time we asked... the server would pass it down to another server... and then just moved on about their business to try and seat as many new customers as possible.  For my money, this place was completely not worth the visit... and will never deserve my recommendations.",

I figured it was Vegas and you get what you get in a tourist city. The one thing that bugged me was that they charge you $1 if you want your rare steak on the side...NOT EXTRA just on the side which didn't make sense to me. I ordered the beef balls pho and the menu said it was $1 for an additional topping so I asked for rare steak on the side (not knowing there was an additional charge for having the meat on the side in the first place) It was a regular bowl and when the bill came it was $10 dollars. In the world of Pho that's pretty pricey for a small bowl. I mean this place looks a little more \"nice\" then regular pho joints, but it definitely wasn't upscale. It just looked like a fast pace late night pho restaurant.",

Plus the place was probably the cleanest Pho place I've ever been to. Will definitely go here again!",

Came here around 4AM on our first night in Vegas after bar hopping by Fremont St.   The Pho that I ordered was satisfying enough to fill my tummy and that warm amazing feeling after gulping down hot soup was great and comforting after a night of drinking!  The restaurant itself is located in Vegas' version of Chinatown, which is basically an outdoor mall/strip. As a native New Yorker, their version of Chinatown isn't as \"cool\" as New York's but at least there was a lot of parking available! As busy as it was, I was able to score a parking spot right in front.   Service was decent, waitress was friendly - I'd come back here again on my next trip to Vegas just 'cause I love Pho that much! (And to get away from all the fast food and overpriced, overrated food options on the strip!)",

The ambiance is really nice and comfortable.  What ruins this is the service. There was absolutely no attention paid to us. Over half the time I was there I had no water. I tried getting the attention of three different workers and was ignored. When two busboys were bussing the table besides us I asked one of them if we could have more water. He barely looked at me and said hold on with his index finger up. That whole time afterwards I was watching him and there were times he had nothing to do and still didn't refill our drinks. Even after making eye contact with him multiple times he still didn't come. That's when I decided to just leave. Just ridiculous. Something as simple as refilling a water was ignored.",

    "text": "Quickie Review: This place is like the Swiss Army Knife of Asian cuisine. It's always there when you need it and it's so versatile. It's primarily a Vietnamese spot but they have a wide variety of dishes but the quality of food doesn't falter. Their hours make it a go-to spot for late night cravings or for sobering up.   Food:  As noted, they have a wide-variety of food despite being a Vietnamese restaurant. Besides the Pho and other dishes they are known for, they can happily serve up delicious selection that are more Chinese or Thai in style. Personally, though I did venture into their Singapore Street Noodles once and was satisfied....I typically stick with their trusty Pho....beef ball to be specific. Once you load that bowl with peppers, mint, sprouts and lime juice (which it's served with)....be ready to enter a fit of delicious rage only to come to your senses when the bowl is empty and you're left wondering what just happened. Seriously, what I inflict on their bowls of Pho could probably be described as a crime of passion in a court of law.....but I digress.  I have tried other peoples' dishes and they are all also amazing. So I doubt you can go wrong.  Atmosphere/Service:  This place is usually packed but that usually doesn't deter seating time or service. Unless you're rolling up 12 deep after a night of clubbing at XS or something, I doubt you will honestly wait more than 10 minutes to be sat...maybe 20 minutes if people have dignity and can resist eating their food like beasts in a blood rage or they're talking/visiting too long.  Always, despite what you order....service is usually pretty damn fast. There have seriously been time where I have received my Pho before my drink....and I am ok with that. The only downside to their service is, it may take sometime to get your bill...so if you're going during lunch....start flagging down your server early.   Overall, this restaurant is akin to a trusty sidekick: it's always there for you, it welcomes you in with loving arms and it won't judge you when you scarf your food down without shame (like me) or if you rolled in after night of hard partying, possibly with disheveled club clothes (like others).",

I've been coming here for years now since I've lived in Vegas, food is always fresh and hot and to me the best I've tasted. After being sat at our table we were broadwater's immediately our waiter did not come for at least 10 minutes to our orders, we ordered a egg rolls pho and  some sodas. Food came out very shortly as did our sodas, but after that we were not asked if we needed anything else no one talked to us our whole time of being there. Someone came by to leave our check on the table, it was not our waiter as they took our bowls away from the table. I had to ask for a refill on my way out. Walking up to the counter to pay we were not greeted by the gentleman he swiped our cards and asked us about 3 times how much tip we wanted to leave have to reply that we believe are tipping cash he then relays the message on their earpiece to let them know we were leaving the tip in cash. I have never experienced anything like that before the only reason why I give this place to stars is because their food is excellent the service needs work! Not sure if I will be back",

Overall the egg roll and dumpling we ordered was really good. The server didn't really check if we needed anything. Then the server comes and ask if we ordered fried rice, he realize it was the wrong table of guests. We had to ask the server for more water and for our check. We had a group of 6 people, they even messed up on our check so I had to tell them to refund me for paying something I didn't order. I think I'll stick to Lee's sandwich next door.",

Gives it a nice ambience for diners, unlike your normal everyday pho place.  Our waitress was so adorable and sweet.  I asked if it would be possible to get pho with just tendon and tripe since I didn't see that on the menu.  She smiled and said, \"Sure! No problem!\"  I've always had a great experience with the service here.  They're accommodating and fast.  Our pho came out literally 5 minutes or less after our waitress put in the order.  Their broth wasn't as flavorful as I remembered it to be, but their eggrolls were insanely oily like it always is.  Still good though!  They gave us our own fish sauce so we didn't have to worry about double-dipping.  If you don't mind the grease, definitely try their eggrolls!",

So I tell him to VOID the transaction and so my other friend comes to pay for it and we just all give her cash. I come home to check my bank statement and see that THEY HAVE BILLED ME FOR THE MEAL AS WELL! Im going to wait a few days to see if he really did void my transaction, but this is ridiculous! Usually when I void my order it shows in my bank statement right away.  So if you're coming in a big group, make sure everyone has cash because this place does not accept split checks! Better yet go elsewhere!  Food quality is mehhh as well. Usually I LOVE pho and can eat the whole bowl but it just did not satisfy me as much as other restaurants.

    "text": "What an awesome name!  Okay, first off... as a teenager, I lived in San Jose CA - a city which has a ton of Vietnamese gangsters... and since I was always looking to get \"hookups\" on car parts, I ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned Vietnamese gangsters. Those guys ALWAYS used to take me to the best pho spots, so I'm no pho newbie.  I decided to try out Pho Kim Long with one of my boys right before he got married in Vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! Funny as hell!  After taking some quick Myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. My homie ordered Pho Dac Biet, and I ordered Pho Tai, which is my favorite because I love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot rice noodles.   As we waited for our food, I did my standard Vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. You can never be too careful, especially since Pho Kim Long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.  The service was pretty good, I appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) I've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but I hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! Aw heyllll NO!  The broth at Pho Kim Long was just \"aiight\" but I guess not bad for Las Vegas... I dont expect Vegas to have top quality pho anyways. Let's face it, people go to Vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. Not pho.   So I'm rating PKL (FHL hehe) with 4 stars. Cause I think it ain't bad for Vegas, and at least the guy's thumb didn't go into my soup. Good lookin out homie.",

One negative about Pho Kim Long is that it is not on the strip, so you have to take a taxi, it is not very far from the strip though.  I got one of the beef pho dishes and my wife got a pork chop with egg and rice.  I enjoyed my Pho, it was what I expected it to be, my wife said she did not like the egg in her meal because it was not cooked in the way that she is used to.  The inside of Pho Kim Long was decorated nicely, with vibrant colors and flowers, and also the quintessential fish tank.  I would recommend Pho Kim Long for the late night eater in Vegas.",

When I lived in Vegas I was a regular and even now whenever I'm in town you will find me here at least a couple times during my trip. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend their Pad Thai (chicken or beef) it's the most amazing Pad Thai you will ever have. The only bad thing about this place is their service, they will take long and a lot of times they will just completely forget about you except for one of the waiters he's always on point, friendly and very helpful (I forgot his name, he's the only young guy with spikey hair.) My other recommendation is the rare steak Pho, I've had Pho so many different places and nothing will ever come close to the broth at Pho Kim Long!! Enjoy!",

In short, the broth tasted really clean - good, but not rich! noodles were too thin - we'd asked for them that way and wanted regular pho noodles, but we only asked to avoid wide-flat noodles! :( The pho was good, overall, but I wish that the noodles were the normal kind and that the broth was richer.  It's slightly more expensive here than in L.A. Well, since they open til 3 AM, I'll give em 3 stars and a half.",

It takes under ten minutes to get to you, yaaay! I hate waiting!  Thai iced tea? Yes please, I'll take two!   Whoa..ok I have control now!!  OK, well I love this place like whoa, think that's obvious.. As I mention in my reviews from time to time, I am a pescetarian and that can be a challenge at times finding food especially late night. This place has great veggie dishes, I recommend the stir fry vegetables (oh girl!) The shrimp is good too but one of my new favorite dishes actually is the cubed steak with onions and green beans. I know what you're saying right this minute, uhhhh how are you a pescetarian then? Well, my friend ordered it I ate one  of the green beans with my rice and immediately had a culinary orgasm. (whoa girl!) I ended up eating like all of them, but she said the steak was tender and juicy and whatever makes red meat good (that's what she said), not into it but those accompaniments were the business! The Thai iced tea doesn't come with refills and that sucks because I can drink like 8 of those. right now. Let's go. Woman vs Drink. Hey that sounds like the theme of my upcoming weekend. details to follow.",

My sister read that this place was well-received and popular.  It wasn't too busy when we arrived at 6:30PM.    For the full review and pics go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kats9lives.com%2F2008%2F07%2Fph-kim-long-need-i-say-more.html&s=d37c26a05cbdb7fdaaf14b7dc146877e115fe2b8cb85650561adca757921fa35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kats9lives.com/2008/07/p...</a>  The food came out SUPER FAST.  I guess for Pho it doesn't take long, but they must have a batch of egg rolls ready to go every second.  They immediately brought the egg rolls out and they were piping hot.  I thought they were good but nothing too special.    They also speak Mandarin here.  The server was listening on our conversation I guess and started to talk to us.  It took me a while to decide what to order.  My family all got a bowl of Pho.  The soup was okay.  Same thing, nothing special but not bad.  The portions here are smaller than what we get in Los Angeles or Orange County.  Eventually I decided to order the French Style Steak.  It was flavorful, but nothing that I would write home about.  Apparently I would write on Yelp about though.  =9 It was alright.  A little bit on the expensive side.  Overall the meal was decent.  They had HUGE signs of Live Crawfish posted everywhere and when we asked they said they didn't have it.  They really should have taken the banner and signs down.  Would I come back here?  Nahhhh... Was it bad?  Not really.  If you just want to satisfy your Vietnamese craving, then I guess this place wouldn't be too bad.",

Comfort food = pho!  We stumbled upon Pho Kim Long after a little drive and our party of 6 was seated immediately!  I know Vegas is a city that doesn't sleep, but even at 12:30 am and 5 minutes away from the strip, this place was still pretty busy!  After eating here, I understand why!  The pho quality is so good!  The soup is delicious and the service is excellent!  Yes!  And actual pho establishment with great service!  Their portions are the perfect size and it comes out fast!  My taste buds were pleasantly surprised.  This place is so good, I plan on visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas.  In the meantime, if you are in Vegas and need some comfort food, come here and check it out!!  You won't be disappointed!",

Prices are reasonable unlike the Pho places inside the casinos where they charge $10 plus for pho !  You can get 10 bowls of Pho in Vietnam for that price.. insane.. but Pho Kim Long is a great place off the strip if you want good authentic pho. Definitely going to make this place a normal stop in vegas.",

I'm not sure how people can complain about the lack of meat in the pho here.  I was thoroughly surprised at how much of it there was.  Friend had the bun bo hue and kept mentioning how good it was, too.  It had a whole pig feet in it.    If you're in Vegas and looking for that Asian fix, this is definitely the place to go.

    "text": "My boyfriend & I came to eat after watching a movie. We haven't ate Pho in awhile, and it's a shame this is one of the only ones open late. My boyfriend ordered Pho Tai (Rare Steak Noodle Soup) & I ordered a Pho Bo Vien (Beef Ball Rice Noodle Soup). It sad, going on the website, their prices are not accurate like the menu. The prices on the menu are overpriced, not even a late night mark-up. Even if I have to pay more, at least the food & service should be worth it. Its neither. I asked for a plate of white onions three times and never received my plate of white onions. The staff also failed to give me my correct change.   This place may be fit for after party goers and drunks. It's so apparent that there are 2-3 metro on site. I even had an officer direct me to my table.   There are plenty of other Pho restaurants I'd prefer over this one. If you're looking for a late night, I'd go to Pho Hung Spring Mountain & Decatur/Lindell. They're open at 9:00am-2:00am (Monday-Sunday).",

It was so hot so I opted for the BBQ pork vermicelli with the egg roll and fish sauce. The rest of the group got pho. I tried a bit of the pho and it was alright. My food was great. Man I love that Vietnamese food can be so healthy. Lots of lettuce, bun noodles, marinated pork and topped with the sliced carrots and daikon and shopped peanuts. Pour some fish sauce on that stuff and you're good to go. It's a great mix of foods - different textures and flavor all combined for a food orgy in your mouth. Mmmm. A little pricey but I'm coming from LA where everything dirt cheap because of all the competition. I think the prices are pretty average for Vegas. Plenty of parking too as it's in a long strip mall.",

Definitely worth every penny when you're hung over.",

They have a large menu which makes it hard for me to choose, while others may find this attractive.  Food is good, my three favorite options are the spicy eggplant without meat & cilantro, the veggie fried rice w/out eggs, or the tofu spring rolls, and a must have is a fresh young coconut !  I like this place also because the hours are convenient, its close to the strip, and there is ample seating.    None of the Pho is Vegan or Veggie based so I haven't tried it but all of my friends say wonderful things,  Oh yeah and I live their chili sauce its really tasty.    The service:  it has heart, but isn't always the best.    Side note: I once ordered the hot & sour soup, I would strongly advise against it, looked like gelatin and smelled like my dogs food, they were so kind when they saw my reaction they just took it back no questions asked.",

Everyone at the table received water but than they never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. Later I ended up ordering a Asahi beer for my husband which he got right away and a Thai Ice tea for me which I had to remind them about 20 minutes later because they forget. I got the combination beef Pho which is always good. My husband ordered the hot wings which weren't hot and when he asked the waitress if these were the right wings, she said \"yes\" and walked away. He also ordered the honey walnut shrimp w/mayo. They were good but not as good as I remember. Also you have to eat them right away because as soon as they cool off the sauce leaves a film in your mouth. Also I think it's crazy you have to pay for a side order of rice ($1.50) to go along w/an entree. My friend ordered Kung Pao shrimp and they had to pay for a side of rice too. Another person in our group was disappointed because they didnt have ANY desert. All in all the food decent, and the service was okay. Would I come back again, yes but probably not anytime soon.",

So far, this has been the best Asian restaurant we've had in Chinatown, so we just automatically come here, now.   The wait is ALWAYS a pain in the ass, because it's always freakin' packed!! But, the wait's worth it. They redecorated since the last time we've been, and it looks like a mini jungle near the windows. lol It's always very loud in this place.   Service is typical of any busy Asian restaurant - you don't have a specific waiter : you ask anyone who will come to you for service. haha   Their food is delish. We had the sweet and sour soup, which had pineapples, beansprouts, catfish, and more. Yum. Their hainam chicken is okay, but it was a big portion. Their stir fried veggies were cooked just right. We also had something called  ca kho, which is catfish simmered in some kind of sauce... I don't know what in the world that sauce is made of, but it's addicting! Mix it with the rice and nom away.   Their pho is pretty good too, although I forgot how much it was. A lot of places attempt to make pho but never succeed. Luckily, this place does, and does it well.   What I didn't know is that they charge each person for rice. At first, I was kind of miffed by that, as many place don't, but I realized that this is very reasonable, considering that many people don't finish the whole thing and waste a ton of it.   Wait out the line and try it! It's such a great representation of Asian food (: You must be tempted now... Go! it's now 24 hours for all you night people ;P",

We are pretty lucky here in Vancouver to have access to an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants but I was excited to find something in Vegas with the same quality and taste as the restaurants back home.  It is open 24 hours so one of my visits was after the club - it was busy but we didn't have to wait. On another night that we went to eat here there was a 20 minute wait but that was around dinner time so that should be expected.  I had the grilled chicken on rice (loved it!) the chicken was tender and moist and it even had the criss-cross grill marks on it. On another night I had the beef pho and it was delicious. As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption. On the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good. Huge portions so we even took the rest to go.  The location is really convenient because it's on the outside of the plaza facing Spring Mountain Road.",

I also tried the clams in black bean sauce (good), fried mussels (ok) and mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts (good).  They asked if we wanted rice, we said yes. Was charged $3. Wish they said something before we saw it on the check. Plus, most places give you white rice for free if you order mains (I can understand if we just ordered pho).  3 mains (in addition to a pho per person) and I'm charged for rice? I'm big on principle.  It's a good deal compared to 99% of restaurants on the strip (for those visiting) but by the time you add in cab fare round trip, it loses some of its value.  But if you're craving pho after a long night of partying - can't go wrong. (though I would also suggest the noodle restaurant at Venetian - its closer, soupy and relatively not pricey)",

Eating in isn't as bad as take out, but every time I order take out I say about 3 words to the guy and he never makes eye contact with me. Once I ordered to go, went to get my order and asked for extra sauces (hoisin, soy & siracha) and he looked me in my eyes, laughed then reluctantly threw my sauces in the bag and said \"I already put some in there but I put more\". I'm sorry it's such a big deal to get extra sauce! Granted, I'm sure the language barrier is a main reason the miscommunication is so bad as well as the service. There's one girl that speaks very good English and she's a sweet heart. Great food, awful service.",

They took forever to bring us the food when they were really slow on this particular night, they brought out one plate and my friend was sitting there waiting half an hour for hers, which never showed up. So we just asked for the check, waited over 15 minutes for that, so we decided to go to the front and just pay up there. We got to the front and her food was waiting there on the counter getting cold, and even though we didn't want to tip them we left 10% anyway, and then we were asked if we wanted to leave 15% 20% or 25% because what we left apparently wasn't enough. I told him whatever the change is, you can keep. And as we turned around the guy scoffed at us and mumbled under his breath. Never come here if you want to be treated with respect and good service.",

    "text": "Was excited to see that there was a pho kim long here in las vegas. I did question whether it was the same owner as the one in San Jose, Ca. One perk is that this place is open 24 hours. It can cure anyone's hangover from a whirlwind night of drinking and partying hard.   The menu was probably comparable to the expensive las vegas area. The bowls of pho were a little on the pricier end in my opinion.   I thought that since this was supposedly the best rated pho restaurant, I would have very good pho broth. There were limited options for pho since they serve other things on the menu. You only had 5-6 pho combinations to choose from. Although, I did not bother asking whether they would change anything on the menu to your taste.   I was very disappointed that the pho broth was VERY VERY watered down. I felt like I was just drinking a bowl of salted water with MSG in. The broth was pretty much almost clear and without color in the bowl. Must be because they couldn't keep up with the supply and demand of pho and watered it all down or this might just be the quality of the pho broth they had.   I was so disappointed that by the time I got home, I went home to make a gigantic pot of pho broth. I'm Chinese and I feel like my pho broth was even better than theirs. At least it looked like pho broth by appearance. It may make you reconsider going out to eat pho ever again or especially at this place!",

This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.  Service: Service here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.  Best part to this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours so you can get your pho craving in anytime.  TLDR; Good Pho and Calamari. Bad service.",

I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.  Now before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer !   My boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, \"Oh, maybe they're still making it\" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, \"Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it.\" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait.   I got my boba just in time we paid for the check and the boba was great but ugh the service is whack. I need I add that we did go there during graveyard hours but still, you can't lack on a job especially if it runs 24/7 and stays busy.",

    "text": "This was my first pho spot many years ago and like an avid foodie/loyalist, I come back. As a server, I understand how hectic it can be during rushes and times of day so I do my best to be patient as possible. I get it you're busy but early this morning was the last time they'll ever get my business. Now, my friends and I have been coming here for years and just a few years ago it became the biggest pho spot so as loyal customers we still come back. Management and service changed big time. (This mornings incident/latest experience)We got sat first before these three other tables and we were not acknowledged (they're busy they'll notice soon enough, not an issue). But then one server went to the table that sat after us and took their order. Then another server went to the table that sat after them and then another server went to the next table after that table. We're all neighboring tables. Servers looked at our table and seen we still have our menus (that means our orders have yet to be taken, service tip 101) but still walked by. I think waiting 25 mins was long enough. So we signaled the waiter and he gave the excuse that he had to take that tables order first because they were first. I let him finish his story and then explained to him that we were first out of the four tables that were sat back to back (he could check the wait list). Longer story short, they forgot my girlfriends calamari (that's fine. Just please put a rush on it. It happens. I get it. Seriously I do) but I would never treat my customers as if they owed me anything! I would never demand a damn tip. Especially when living in a service city at a restaurant where the service was horrendously below par (not the first, second, or fifth time) and I made so many excuses for the service as it is. I apologize for the long review but my once favorite pho place has changed in many great ways and although my business may not affect their business now but know that you should not feel rushed, Unwelcome, forced to tip in a city that survives on its consumers. I do not recommend this establishment.",

    "text": "If I could give this place no stars I would. I use to love this place. But I noticed that lately they have been inconsistent. One day the portions are generous than the next day they give you half the size.   Most recent experience: When I asked our waiter why is the portion so small he responded, \"that's how we make it now.\" and he grabbed our food before asking if we wanted something different. I accepted it and continued eating. As I walked out of the restaurant I noticed a family that had ordered the same thing as I did and their food looked way different and the portion was very generous. So I brought it up to our waiter. I asked him how can he tell me that what he served was how they make it now, but I see a whole table with the same exact food i ordered and our meal looked nothing like it. So the waiter brought it up to the manager (Jonathan) in front of me. Before he even asked me what the problem was he charged my card and took a phone call while I was waiting to talk to him. He gave me the receipt to sign and then he tried to just brush me off like nothing was wrong. I explained the situation and he didn't care at all. He said, \"I should've grabbed him when I thought something was wrong. I said, \"I brought it up to your waiter and how am I suppose to know you're the manager?\" So he said he didn't know that something was wrong. But I mentioned that I heard the waiter tell him right in front of me that I was upset and he got caught in a lie. After I explained to him that the customer service was bad and obviously the food was bad he asked me if I could move over because the line to pay was getting long. I asked him for a refund and his response was, \"no I'll remember you and the next time you come in I will make sure your food is good.\" I thought to myself...I know this restaurant is busy. How are you suppose to remember me out of all the customers?   I knew he was full of it. So I just left. It's sad how this place has gone down hill. Even the staff is different not as good as the old staff.",

The first server we had was attentive and refilled our water glasses frequently even when the whole restaurant was so busy.   The deduction in my rating, and the only negative thing I do have to mention, is because the 2nd server who took over attending to us, while friendly, was too pushy in trying to get us out of the restaurant asap. My friend was sitting at the table by herself for maybe 10-15 min tops (I stepped outside to take an emergency phone call while my other friend went to the restroom and then stepped outside for a smoke afterwards), and she said the server asked her twice during this time if we were all done. Even when we both came back, he came around two more times asking if we were finished. For crying out loud, there was still food on the table and we were clearly still eating! Yes, the restaurant is busy and there's a line to enter (we also had to wait 30 minutes to be seated), but please remember that we're still paying customers who hadn't finished their dinner yet and that insistent pestering made us uncomfortable.",

    "text": "THANK YOU, VEGAS, FOR HAVING A 24/7 PHO RESTAURANT. My miserable, hungover soul is so grateful.  I rode the struggle bus (Lyft) here on a Saturday night around 10pm after suffering from a dreadful day club hangover. I found my cure in the wonton egg noodle soup and the fresh young coconut. (I know, I know. Who orders wonton soup at a pho restaurant?) But the egg noodle soup was surprisingly pretty good! Coming from San Francisco and one of the largest Chinatowns in the country, I can definitely say that I've had better, but for what it was, it hit the spot. I was craving a lighter soup than beef-based pho broth anyway.   But the light at the end of the hangover tunnel was the fresh young coconut. SOO GOOD AND SO REFRESHING. Comes served in a coconut, and they give you a spoon so you can scrape off the pulp inside to eat. I felt like a brand new woman afterwards! Okay, not really, my head still hurt, but the coconut/soup really did help.  Service was friendly and made sure our water cups were filled. I look forward to curing future hangovers here.",

In my opinion, even if you're not the server, waiter or whatever, the least you can do is say, \"I will get your waiter\". Something at least!!   Instead of make eye contact and walk away.   They barley acknowledge you or ask If you're doing ok or need anything else.   I'm not even from here and I was recommend to go here and I am extremely disappointed.   There is an African American worker that may be the manager or supervisor or may just the host, and when you address him, he automatically says \"I just work here, not my problem.   It would be more expectable if the food was really good but it taste old.   The African American host or whatever he is pot used water cups and re filled them with water to serve again without washing it.   I thought it was a mistake but I witnessed it twice during my dinner.   This is just disgusting and gross  Who cares about it being open 24 hours long. The food isn't even good.   It's just a hype.   Customer service is beyond trash and I know this review won't change anything.",

Service was fun and friendly. Very accommodating..I asked about the fish sauce at the table and she brought me a 'diluted' version... Tasted like it was mixed with rice wine vinegar. Delicious with the eggplant.    The bill was a little high for lunch... Compared to surrounding pho joints, but overall a good choice.",

Wow, I told myself I wasn't going to come back again. Second time I came it was for a friend's birthday. As we were eating we were excited that it was our friend's birthday so we yelled happy birthday. Then as a response the whole restaurant yells happy birthday as well. That was extremely heartwarming. Then an employee comes over and asks us to quiet down as if birthdays weren't tolerated at this restaurant. My bill at the end of the night was $22. I gave them $25 and told them to keep the change. Then the guy goes, what tip? So I responded excuse me? Then he ignored me while counting my change. The customer service here is not the business.",

Open 24/7! It's always packed no matter what time of day or night and it's not just the clever name that draws the crowds. The food is excellent.   We started out with the fresh spring rolls, fried egg rolls and the crab puffs. All were excellent, but the fresh spring rolls were the favorite.   For the main event we all had the small beef pho. Absolutely fantastic, great flavor and full of meat and noodles. I regretted not ordering the large bowl once I started eating it.   To drink I had a Thai iced tea. Delicious!   Service is excellent even when it's packed!  In Las Vegas and need a Vietnamese fix? Be sure to Pho Kim Long!  Enjoy!",

My boyfriend and I ordered the Hu Tieu Rice Noodle Soup and the Vermicelli Noodles with BBQ Pork and Eggrolls (Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio).  Hu Tieu Rice Noodle Soup We have definitely had better but the noodles were cooked very well - chewy but not underdone. The noodle to soup ratio was perfect but they could have used a little more vegetables in it. Most Hu Tieu Noodle Soups have quail eggs in them and this one didn't but that might just be something my boyfriend and I look for.   Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio Really great presentation! And the food came out very quickly -- but with that said, the egg rolls weren't fresh so they were slightly soggy and warm. The dish was served in a really small bowl and anyone who's eaten this before knows there's a lot of mixing to be done so not having a bigger bowl made it difficult. Last thing about this was that there weren't mint leaves in it! Traditionally this dish always has stronger herbs to mix in, but still it didn't make or break the meal! I'd still recommend you try it if you haven't had it before.  3 stars but an extra star for how quick their service is.",

    "text": "After closing out XS, we were cold and hungry. Not knowing where to go, I whipped out my handy, dandy Yelp app and came across Pho Kim Long. It wasn't a popular choice with my friends, but I wanted soup, darn it, so away we went. When we got in the car, my friend said we were going to some soup place, and the driver already knew where to go without even saying the name.  There was a line when we arrived, but we were seated pretty quickly, and in front of some other parties. I was starving by this point, so I got a rare brisket pho and some mixed spring rolls. The rolls came out first, and they weren't all that good. Because of my state, however, I ate all of them in record time. The pho was okay. I don't really eat pho, because it's not my favorite, but it hit the spot on this particular evening.   We left around 5:30am, and there was still a line waiting to be seated.",

Drinks arrived as soon as the server left and minutes later, our apps and food arrived.  This place is so quick and it's not a bad price at all. Will definitely be coming back! And I'll be bringing friends next time. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great experience.  Only downside is the parking here.

Seems like every Californian/out-of-towner has heard of this place somehow, someway and wants to eat here for the hell of it and post it on social media. But that's really a shame since there's literally a dozen other venues you can choose from.  The place is always crowded whether its day or night. Takes forever to get seating and once you do, ordering takes time as well. The food is very mediocre. If I wanted to show my friends a good pho venue in town this certainly wouldn't be my first choice.  What's good is that they are 24/7, which is probably the only reason why they're so popular (oh and their name of course). The only reason why I'm ever here is because they are always open and sometimes I am that guy who is drunk at 2am in the morning.",

It's tasty, it's inexpensive, it's fast and it's open 24 hours a day... it's really all you can ask from a pho place... I'm a very indecisive person, so I always get the combination pho so I can get a little bit of everything. I also love their Thai iced tea (with boba) and their chicken lettuce wrap is always a hit.. the only thing I've had there that I didn't like was the calamari. It's too oily and no seasoning. No one liked it when my friends and I tried it.   I would rate this place higher if it was only about the food. But sadly, i have to agree on this part with the other yelpers: their customer service SUCKS!! I have been spoken down to and mocked by a manager. A manager! All because I didn't like calamari and wanted to send it back... lesson learned. DO NOT ORDER THE CALAMARI.",

Nestled in a strip mall in Chinatown serves some of the best Pho around including LA which is pretty impressive. The broth they use is amazing, not overly salty or under flavored, this place found the right mixture. 5 stars for a place the serves  a 6 star bowl of Pho! Ok enough of my overly Pho tastic experience. The place seems to be busy at 2am on a weekday so it must be fantastic! Especially if you see other Asians eating there. That is always a mark of a great restaurant when locals are enjoying the food. Service was ok, we did have to try several times to get ahold of our waiter for water or to give us our check but that's understandable when your taking care of several tables at one time.   Definitely a new stop while visiting!",

I saw that there were mixed reviews here, but the overall rating was good, so we chose Pho Kim Long.  When we got to the restaurant, there was a long wait, so I was anxious to try the pho, thinking it was going to be delicious. We finally got seated after 20 minutes, and the waitress assisted us right away. We ordered our food which was out in less than 10 minutes. I ordered a small bowl of pho and my cousin ordered a large bowl. My bowl had just about the same amount of noodles (a lot) his did, so that was strange. He ended up having to order extra noodles.  Overall, the restaurant was beautiful, the service was great, but the pho was kind of bland. The pricing was very affordable and cheap, so it was worth it for hungry tourists.",

I remember the food being pretty good as a kid, so I looked forward to coming here again.  My girl and I shared rice with BBQ'd pork and hu tieu with beef.  The BBQ'd pork was nice and smokey. I was surprised by the broth that came with the rice. Normally it comes in a dinky ass rice bowl, but it was at least twice the amount of a rice bowl. F yeah! Our hu tieu was good, but definitely a little too salty and that's coming from someone who loves sodium. Speaking of salty, their broth is a little on the salty side too, but it's also packed with a lot of flavor. The service was also very friendly and amusing too.  The other pho spots in the area are repulsive. Just put up with the wait and eat here instead.",

I am a vegan, and eating vegan in Asian cuisine shouldn't be an issue.  I never had a problem with it back home.  And this is Las Vegas, the restaurants here are supposed to be better than the shitty small town I come from.    But when I asked for the Singapore curry noodles with no animal products, and only vegetables, what they brought out was a plate of noodles that had been mixed with curry powder.  No vegetables at all.  I sent it back saying \"There's no vegetables here, I wanted vegetables with it\", and they asked what kind and I said \"Just mixed chinese vegetables like you would put into just about any other dish, just no animal products\".   They then brought me out another plate of just noodles and no vegetables, but this time a different kind of noodles. I sent it back again.  Finally, starving, I got a plate of noodles with some vegetables and I ate it even though it was below par.    I don't know what is wrong with these people.  It wasn't that they don't speak english, because they spoke perfect English, no accents or anything, a lot of the people who work there are american.  I think they're just completely lackluster and are one of these restaurants that don't pay any attention to what they are doing.  Eat somewhere else.",

YES, everyone is hungover and tired.  but everyone seems to come to this place for pho to cure their head ache.  i've been multiple times after a night of clubbing and it usually hits the spot. before entering, you will usually have to put your name down on a wait list,  but don't fret, the wait time is very short.  The portions are big and the broth is tasty.  I like how they have the condiments on the table.  if you are one of the types of people who need white onion with your pho, make sure you specify white onion.  my friend got green onions before....lol... wtf.  If you want fast food, get PHO.  i once ordered the pad thai, and when everyone got their phos and was almost done with it, i just got my entree.... so i don't know what the fuck i was thinking ordering something that wasn't pho at this place.  but real talk, the pad thai was delicious.  i might get it again when i come back to vegas.  haha.  come here if you want fast service and cheap good drunk food. and they are open 24/7!!!!!",

    "text": "I've heard so much good stuff about Pho Kim Long, and plenty of jokes about the restaurants name, but the food is definitely no joking manner.  Opened 24 hours  and on Spring Mountain Rd, this place is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the late night hang over snack. But be warned, normal wait time can be  anywhere between 30 min to over an  hour as this place is busy as ever.  We ordered  Pho Tai (rare beef), Bun bo hue (it's like a vermicelli noodle soup with different types of beef and you can add this spicy sauce to it), and the Cam bo luc lac (diced tender beef with steamed rice).  The Pho soup has amazing flavors and is rich in texture, but their small and large isn't much of  a difference in bowl size so I'd recommend opting for the large. I can't say much about comparing bun bo  hue to other restaurants as it was my first time, but I'm a fan! My only grip is that I wish they had given more meat for the bo  luc lac dish...it seemed on the skimpier side but the flavors were really delicious.  Staff is very attentive for refills, taking empty plates away, and utensil requests. Ambience is clean,  surprisingly  spacious, and constantly busy. Next time I return to Vegas, I can't wait to return to Pho Kim Long!",

I tried this place with my entire family awhile back and we ordered some chinese dishes which were alright (though the seafood items were a no go).  I came back recently because I wanted to give the pho noodle soup another try (I had forgotten what it tasted like).  Turns out, I forgot because it's nothing too memorable - not horrible, but not exactly mind blowing either.    Here are the pros:  They have an extensive menu with pictures, and a variety of different dishes beyond what you see at your traditional pho place.  Their wings with special sauce were pretty delicious too. Sweet and slightly spicy.  It's pretty clean and looks pretty new.   Here are the cons:  If you're coming just for a regular pho special noodle soup, I'd say that it's decent here, but not great.  The one big gripe I had was that their pho special does not have tripe in it.  But if you're not a tripe fanatic like me, I guess it wouldn't matter to you.    Also, I don't think they give as much meat in their pho noodle soups as other places - the pho special large was really not that large, and only had a few pieces of rare steak and brisket in it.",

Pleaded for their attention and got slightly flustered telling them we couldn't eat with our hand and his order was wrong.  Took it back and finally his Bun Bo Hue came and it looked strange because there is no lemongrass chili sauce and it is the exactly the same with Pho.   Called the server  and gave us a dirty look saying the sauce were on the side and we got to mix it ourselves (first time ever in Vietnamese rest and my buddy is a owner of Viet rest).  Broth is decent, food was decent, the service was as rude as one can be.  I really should raise the issues with the manager but my friend told me NOT to do so.

At first u think it's gonna be a dump but when u get in there u realize this place is pretty snazzy. We like to judge places by their quality of Thai iced tea. Theres was pretty damn good. I prefer the strong tea taste instead of the overly sweet powdery mix.   We order pho tai & rice with the egg & pork.   Pho tai: He made it jumbo & it was the perfect size or him. The beef was tender & he said it was one of the best broths he's had (MSG? He doesn't care)  Rice meal: I can see why people would think their portions are normally I would have agreed, but honestly tonight it was the perfect size.

As soon as we finished eating, who strolls in? The rest of our friends that we had been with just about 30-40 mins earlier. We hadn't told them where we were going. Watch out Jack in the crack, people just LOVE pho when they're drunk.  Pho or vermicelli always hits the spot. Everyone has their own way of eating pho. Some people prefer lots of bean sprouts & chili paste or sriracha in it. It's all about preference. The last time I ate it, I was a little bummed that I ran out of noodles.  A good thing to take note of, is that you can order pho in a small or large size. Kalila is little and she actually finished her small bowl.  The location is rather large with lots of tables from wall to wall. They do accommodate to bigger parties, putting multiple tables together if need be.",

Usually pho takes five min tops to get out but it took like 20 minutes! What's worse was, one's pho dish got here after 5 min of sitting, while everyone else's took 20 minutes. My poor friend wanted to be polite and wait for at least one other person to get their food... so that was not fun. Probably did not taste that great for her, either. I ordered the grilled chicken and rice dish and the chicken turned out super dry.  We had a grumpy server who practically did not check up on us at all... man, it was a painfully long wait! I'd go to a different Vietnamese restaurant instead.  Perhaps if you come here late at night (or early in the morning) it'd be better. esp since it's open 24 hours and you can prevent that hangover from clubbing all night!",

    "text": "Pros- open late, wide variety of choices, good Central location  Cons- too expensive compared to other Pho places, food is rarely fresh which is insane with all the business they get, service is slow and robotic, always crowded yet isn't good so its basically just full of wanna be's who think this is good Pho, food wildly inconsistent from order to order so its like playing roulette if you want a decent meal  In summary my opinion is if you want to pay 150% for 50% of the quality of most any other pho joint while surrounded by people who will be discussing thier favorite dj and best flavor of axe body spray well then roll on in to the oh so cleverly named Pho Kim Long...get it? Fornicate him for an extended period of time. .. Comedy gold.",

    "text": "I've never been to any business or restaurant in Vegas' Chinatown. I've always wanted to try something down here but it's nowhere near my home and unfortunately, the most adventurous restaurant my family will try is Panda Express (bleh) Luckily, I FINALLY got my Vegas Chinatown cherry popped when Beau S. took me for dinner here on 4/20/11 after coming to see the show I worked for.   We checked out the menu and prices for Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesar's and I quipped that the same food would probably be about $6 in Chinatown, about a 4 minute drive away from the Strip. After a quick car ride, we were here.   24 hours is always a good sign to me because it means two things - the food is tasty, and it's probably not too pricey.  We were seated quickly and were asked if we knew what we wanted to order after a few minutes. Because I hadn't been there before, I needed more time to check out the extensive menu.   Pad Thai is kryptonite for me. I absolutely can't pass it up. The spicier, the better. I ordered the chicken pad thai and asked for it to be as spicy as possible. The waiter looked nervous when I said I really did want it as spicy as possible. I want my food to be \"sinus clearing spicy\" every time. Delicious. Beau ordered a beef pho and the Thai Tea.  The waiter brought me a fork and a spoon and Beau... nothing. I didn't catch what Beau meant when he said he liked how the waiter assumed he didn't need a fork and spoon but I did, until I thought about it the next day. Maybe white people tend to not know how to use chopsticks? I don't know, but I know how, and I obviously wasn't offended, so the fork and spoon were left untouched.   The waiter brought out our food fairly quickly and was giving me a look like they might need an EMT soon due to the spiciness of the food. I was actually a little scared based on how the waiter was acting. I took a bite.... MILD, borderline not spicy. Pssssh. Typical. Maybe it's because a girl, but regardless of what type of restaurant I'm at, when I order \"spiciest you can possibly make the dish\" apparently the waiters think I can't handle myself and it comes out mild. Wah. I doused my plate in chili sauce and Sriracha sauce to the point of ridiculousness. Perfect. The Pad Thai was killer and as usual eating things that aren't cut up, I'm sure I made a fool of myself trying to get it into my mouth semi-daintily.   I liked that the waiters were on top of their stuff. My water glass was never left unfilled. One waiter even said he read my mind as he filled up my glass, and he was actually ahead of me. That's how it's supposed to be so not only was the food phenomenal, the service was great too.  Beau made a fantastic choice bringing me here and I would gladly go out of my way to eat here again.",

They are all very generic with just broth, noodles, meat, veggies and basil on the side. None of them are SPECIAL.  This place quickly changed my mind. I ordered the vegan pho with tofu nuggets. Broth was extremely flavorful. Noodles weren't too mushy. Vegetables in my pho. I'm a happy girl.  All of this can be said with their regular pho, as my friends finished every single drop of broth and every single strand of noodle. Add in the fact that this place is open 24/7, and we have a winner for the first time I liked eating pho.",

The restaurant was packed at 3:30 AM in the morning. Some were still in their skimpy clubbing outfit, others in their PJ most likely suffering from insomnia, and lets not forget the pervy men who just got done at the strip club.  Pho came out in a big bowl full of salty broth and a seriously lacking in content. Two thin slices of pork and 3 pieces of bok choy is not enough to compensate for the 5 hours of dancing we just did.  Was too hung over to check out the bathrooms.",

    "text": "I forgot why I hadn't visited in such a long time, but now I remember. Everything was so unmemorable. We visited one evening with a friend when our first choice in Chinatown had an hour wait. I should have trusted the instinct of not going to your last choice.  We ordered the Salt and Pepper Calamari to start. The batter was strange and oily, but still pretty tasty with the chopped chilies, garlic, and etc. Plus, the dipping sauce was good. Ruben ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (charbroiled pork and egg roll with rice vermicelli noodles). The pork was flavorful, but the dish as a whole was not very cohesive and bland. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with the Vegetarian option. I really like the flat, thick rice noodles and lots of fresh vegetables, so I was immediately drawn to this dish, however, it lacked in flavor and depth. A bit of Sriracha sauce saved it toward the end, but any great dish wouldn't have to rely on a table condiment. Our friend, Juan, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it was okay.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the meal very much. The highlight was the Calamari and still, that was no where close to being the best calamari dish I've eaten. Obviously, I didn't try Pho and perhaps that may be something they do really well? I wouldn't count on it since everything else was so disappointing. Service was okay, no complaints. Anyway, there are so many other spots in town serving up better Thai food, Vietnamese food, and whatever else they're serving here and just steps away.",

STAY AWAY FROM THE HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP. $16.00 and you get a few shrimps that weren't even thoroughly cooked along with poor presentation. The batter covering the shrimp was soft and soggy, you could still taste the powdery batter mix. The portion wasn't even worth $16. The honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express would be a better option. The spring rolls weren't good either. Prices are too high for such bad tasting/mediocre dishes. I've been here a few times before in the past, hoping that each time it would be a better experience than last time but it just gets worse and worse. Honestly, Kim Long is only busy because they have a good location and its open 24/7. You want good Vietnamese food? Go to Pho So 1 or Pho Saigon 8.",

Ordered my usual of Pho Dac Biet, basically all kinds of yummy tendon and tripe in it.   Strangely I think this was the best meal I had all weekend.    One of my friends freaked out that he had tripe in his Pho when he ordered Tai Chin.  Really funny, cause I knew right away when he was asking wtf that meat in his bowl was.  He asked to have the problem fixed and they easily made it right.  From what i know, there are more mediocre or flat out horrible Pho restaurants in Las Vegas.

After a night of enthusiastic fist pumping to Armin van Buurin at Marquee, our arms were sore, our feet were hurting, and our stomachs were empty. My friends had already gone the night before (in a limo, no less -- we do it big in Vegas), but pho just really seemed to be a really good idea.   The taxi line was monstrous but we managed to squeeze into a 5-person taxi and off we went to pho heaven! The small bowls were big, the broth was brothy, the noodles were noodly, and the meat was definitely meaty. The basil was so basily my friend couldn't help putting several branches in his mouth like a koala. Pho really is the best drunk/hangover food ever.  In the words of one of my dear EAP friends... \"MM, this really hits the SPOT! I'm not sure which spot it is, but it's hitting it!\"  Also, I love that they have a large man standing in the front who opens the door for you. Is he a bouncer? A door-opener? Who knows??",

We arrive before 8 and there is more staff than customers. We are a group of 8. I didnt think the food is special. Average but our group had to have viet. At the end the guy shows me a bill with pre printed tip for 15% 20%. I said you brought out 8 bowls or plates. For that you decide to pretend you are a fine dining establishment and charge almost $15 for tip. That's getting close to $2 a bowl. Give me a break. Your place is empty because the food is mediocre.

My food took less than 10 minutes and I received a huge bowl of soup with plenty of vegetables and a perfect amount of noodles accompanied with the usual plate with sprouts, hot peppers, Basil and limes. The pho was delicious I would go back in a  beat. The server didn't really come check if my dish was ok besides when I was about to finish my dish.

However the broth did have a citrus taste to it and I didn't squeeze no lime or lemon in it so I'm thinking it might have been remnant from the sprouts.

I remember eating here years ago and it was a bad experience. Since, they changed owner a few times, We thought maybe it's better this time.  First impression walking thru the door was good. Small waiting area. The decor was nice and unique.   We got seated right away which was extra plus because we were starving.   I always order my favorite Pho Bo Vien soup.   While I was waiting for my food, I was admiring the remodeling and remodeled design. It looks nice and welcoming. The atmosphere was nice. Noisy was the usual loudness in every pho restaurant. Everyone having a good time chit chatting with each other.   So, I got my bowl. It looked good. When I finished garnishing my pho and took the first bite.... Hmmm... Let me see.... I felt the broth was flavorful but the meat ball was nasty. The broth was unique in itself. But I wanted to like it but ended up being disappointed.   I gave them 3 stars because of customer services. They were very attentive to filling up my ice water and asking how we are doing.   Maybe other dish will be good. I'll come back and try something else    But Give this place a try. You never know, your taste bud will like it or hate it.",

    "text": "You would think that a place like this would be the Mecca of late night grubbing in Chinatown, but sadly this place really isn't that good. The food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.  The people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. It wasn't really that busy inside because I think everything is a little slower in Vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). I feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... That's not the case here.  Anyway, onto the food. My friend and I ordered their crab rangoons, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp fried rice.  When the crab rangoons came to our table, my initial thought was \"WHAT ARE THOSE?!\" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. They looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. Fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.  The shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. The noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. The presentation wasn't too appealing, either. It literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...  The shrimp fried rice was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. The shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. The Sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the fried rice, I can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!  Anyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then Pho Kim Long is in the same league as any average Asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. Pho Kim Long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc.   Overall, I did not have an enjoyable experience. I think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 AM and want something to eat in the late hours of the night/early morning, but even that is a BIG maybe for me... Save your appetite for something better.",

But, this time it really wasn't anything exceptional and I had wished I just ate somewhere else after. I think my main issues is the poor customer service. Anytime if I ask a question or if we're low on the items at the table, they usually give me a dirty look and make it seem that I'm such an annoyance to them. I think the last straw for me was when my dad was asking about a dish and the guy was like if you're so worried about it then don't eat it. Ridiculously rude. Not even good enough food to even come off with poor customer service.",

Coming here for lunch on a sober morning, we were seated at a reasonable time and given a menu to browse.  Right after that, the experience went downhill from there.  It took almost 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order.  Once our order was placed, it didn't take as long for our food to arrive.  We ordered their bun bo hue and pho combination. Broth for both was simply salty.  Their bun bo hue was nothing I would have expected from what should be a spicy flavorful broth, it was rather plain and simply salty.  I left with excessive sodium intake and needed H2O to normalize.  Perhaps it is the salty hot broth that when intoxicated hits the spot, but when awake and alert... it is a different experience.",

The waiting area is very small and most guests on the waiting list have to wait outside the front door (which is fine).  I literally stepped outside for 2 minutes to let my family know it would be around 10 minutes.  I walked back in and waited for around 10 minutes.  When I checked the waiting list I saw that our name was scratched out (party of 6).  I asked the young hostess why our name was scratched off and she very rudely told me that \"I called your name and you didn't answer!\"  Which maybe could have happened?  Just a suggestion sweetie..... when you have 20 guests waiting outside with their name on the list, you might try a little harder and make a little more of an attempt to call their name so that they can hear you!

OK.. 25 cents I could understand but a dollar? It doesn't cost a dollar to clean an extra plate and I'm sure the plate isn't that big anyways. Oh and also hot tea is not free. $1 per cup. Is it just a Nevada thing or is it just this place? Our pho arrived and I thought WTH. Isn't pho dac biet suppose to have a lot of meat not like 5 pieces? My bf dug everything up from the bottom of his bowl and the picture provided is what it looks like. Not worth the money.",

The staff were friend and spoke english and Vietnamese.   I was sorta disappointed by the food. It was okay for being in Nevada. I got the pho dac biet and it was missing a lot of items that are usually in traditional pho dac biet. The broth was very bland and not very flavorful. It wasn't bad but it needed a little bit more flavor. However I did get eggrolls (cha gio). They came out pretty good. They were hot and crunchy.   The food is overpriced for typical vietnamese food but judging from the location I guess it is acceptable. If you are from SoCal the food and price at the restaurant are not comparable to areas like Little Saigon or Alhambra.   Overall it was a decent experience. I wouldn't recommend it for people who know traditional vietnamese food, but I do recommend it for people who are trying vietnamese food for the first time.",

    "text": "OK, so I'm a big fan of Pho Kim Long, and consider myself a regular there.  There are times I'm here three+ or more nights a week for dinner.    It literally is THE BEST pho for the price in Vegas.  It is the closest to what my mother makes!! The broth is always nice and thick (like it should be in good pho).  I can tell they didn't skimp in bone marrow and beef when they cooked it.  The special always has an abundance of meat.  Perfectly sliced beef, not too many tendons, and one of the finer qualities of meatballs (yes there are different ones in the stores that are better in quality).  The meatballs, better in quality you will notice that when you bite into them do not have a lot of those little white fatty pieces (which are disgusting).  The Goi Cuon looks similarly and perfectly rolled like my aunt's.  They stay in shape bite after bite, without lacking in pork and shrimp on the inside.  Most I've tried around town are either poorly rolled, like they rolled the rice papers too tight so it rips when it dries (also an indicator of freshness).  Or...when you bite into one of these delicious appetizers, all you seem to taste is too much rice paper, then I'd feel ripped off because I feel like I got gipped out of pork and shrimp.  Nevertheless, with how big the restaurant is and how busy it is, the servers are attentive.  The service is fast (waiting more than 5 minutes for a bowl of pho is ridiculous since everything is pre-made and just needs to be put together).  There's never a ridiculously long wait for me when I go there for a table (please be respective of the number of people in your party and and what time you arrive).",

When I was released from the hospital and craving comfort and a quick start to my system I came her. It was 2 AM on a Wednesday and they were kind of busy. My friend and I were immediately sat and 2 seconds later water was being dropped off and a little lady came over to our table and took our order, I stated I needed a few minutes.  We ordered spring rolls and two differnt kinds of pho, beef and vegan.  The food came out quickly. The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.  Our pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed.   Although it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about... I personally think it's the tongue-in-cheek, punny name sake.  Pho Long, I will not be back. I can make my own punnies too.",

I'd never been before and while the parking lot can be a bit of a challenge, once inside it's rather spacious and well-decorated.  Our party of 8 got sat quickly even with several names before us on the list.  It took a bit for the ordering and the food, but nothing awful.  What was kind of a bummer is we ordered boba, appetizers and entrees - the appetizers and entrees came at appropriate times but the boba came halfway through the entree.  I don't know if that was on purpose or not, but everyone in my group thought it would have arrived first.  Spring rolls were a bit chewy but the overall taste was ok. The peanut dipping sauce was good.  Their bun thit nuong cha gio (grilled sliced pork & fried egg rolls over cold vermicelli and vegetables) is actually better than some of the other places I've tried in town, but I felt it was more expensive with less food.  Chalk that up to the 24-hour convenience, I suppose.  Coconut milk slush boba was pretty good, especially for a place that isn't a standalone boba shop.  My friend let me try some of his pho broth and I do have to say it's pretty darn tasty.  Several people at my table ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and said it had some sort of a weird/bad aftertaste.  I didn't try it, but considering half the table did and that was their response it was worth mentioning.  If I was in the area, it'd be a toss-up if I came back.  I'd probably just order take-out and hope it doesn't get cold on my drive back to Green Valley.",

This was probably one of the worst vermicelli dishes I've ever had (and I've had this dish at many restaurants). The chicken lacked flavor.. It didn't have that Vietnamese \"charbroiled\" taste. And more importantly, the fish sauce was bland!! It didn't taste right.. almost as if it was watered down or they didn't make it correctly. I ate 1/4th of the bowl and ended up wasting the rest of it.  My friends ordered the pho and porridge, and they also left more than half of their food because it just wasn't good. Maybe because we're spoiled with Viet food from Garden Grove? Who knows. Oh, and service here does not exist.. Typical for an Asian restaurant I guess.   Note: The Yelp hours are wrong! They're open 24 hours.",

    "text": "As bad as it is to say, this is possibly my favorite pho spot in town. Back when I was a young'n this was the place that introduced me to pho. Anytime I had a bad day at work Pho Kim Long was there for me. Anytime I was drunk as a skunk and stumbling out of the clubs at 4am, they were there for me. When I broke my leg and needed a good meal, pho Kim long was there for me.  The pho is pretty good. On the rare occasion it had been meh, but I put my faith in them. I absolutely love their spring rolls and their peanut sauce. It is to die for, and I use that peanut sauce on so many dishes.its one of my foodie little secrets. The staff is very friendly, sometimes they get a little overworked and hectic but they do work hard and always aim to please. If you're new to town, or you want reliable pho, gotta get some pho Kim long",

Maybe they just don't really care for the whole serving deal, but that's not my fault.   It's still a great restaurant though.

We won't even be done eating and they throw us a check without a word as if they want us to leave already. My fiance and I became regulars coming to this restaurant and they probably remember us coz everytime I come here the food gets smaller and smaller.   I guess theres a SIZE IN THERE SOUP bowls which is small, medium, or large. They never tell you that they just asume you want small. But when we ask for large they never told us there was a extra charge.   the first time I ate here the soup was so cheap and it could feed 2 people. Last night when I ate there it was smaller.  I'm not coming here again.   The food already pays for itself but the service won't let you come back.",

    "text": "My Recommendation: There are much better options for pho around town during regular business hours. This place is only good to satisfy an after-hours craving.  When you walk into Pho Kim Long, the first thing you see in front of you is a hostess booth, which is very out of place considering they don't have a hostess. You have to wait for a busser to seat you. That system is very inconvenient when it's busy. You'd have to wait until one of the bussers frees up to even put you on the waiting list, so essentially, you have to wait in line before you get the chance to wait \"in line\".  Although I have tried and liked other things on the menu, I mainly just order the Pho. For a place called Pho Kim Long, you'd assume they'd put their main focus into their pho dishes, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. The overall taste of the Pho is good, but it's the uneven portions that deduct from its rating. Too much meat and not nearly enough noodles. One visit, I ordered a large Rare Beef Pho, but the waiter gave me a small. I'm not upset about that. That's a simple mistake, but just out of curiosity, I reached into the bowl with my chopsticks and lifted up the noodles to get an idea of how much came in that order. It was pathetic. I was easily able to  hold every noodle up with one swipe. I thought \"maybe it's just because it's the small\". I then told the waiter about the size error and he came back almost immediately with the correct size, but when I checked to see what portions I was given this time, it was like deja vu.  I received almost exactly the same amount. It's as if they just poured the small bowl from earlier into a larger bowl and added a few more scoops of broth. The lack of noodles is where the imbalance of noodle-to-meat ratio comes in. I was long done with all of my noodles before my meat. I had to resort to biting my noodles in an attempt to ration them so I had some for every new piece of meat, and this is a definite \"no-no\" in the noodle world.   Customer service is friendly, when present. This place often gets hit with a high volume of customers during the night (probably because they are one of the few Vietnamese restaurants that stay open 24 hours) so if you like places where the waiter is very attentive, this is not the place for you. Although I do commend them for being able to keep a friendly demeanor under stressful conditions, it's just sometimes I'd prefer a refill on my drink instead of a smile.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The walls are aligned with live aquariums and decorative flora and for such a high traffic restaurant, it is kept extremely clean. To be honest, it looks like a fine dining establishment.    Another positive about this place, that I briefly mentioned before, is that it is open 24 hours and conveniently located just off of the strip. It's close enough to not be a hassle to get to after a long night of partying, but far enough to get away from all of the chaos of stereotypical Las Vegas.   I have a strong suspicion that their pho dishes are premade. The wait time from point-of-order to point-of-arrival is very short. Extremely short if you take into consideration how busy it gets; that's most likely why they'd do that. If I had to wait as long as it would take to make every meal made-to-order, the wait would not even be worth it.   In short, I would probably never crave Pho Kim Long's pho specifically, but if it's after hours and I am craving pho in general, this would be the place to go only because there aren't many other options.",

The veggies are yummy too! Green beans, bok choy etc... if this place was closer to where I live I'd be there every few days guaranteed! Open one closer to Henderson pllllease!!! As far as the service goes, it's spotty. Everyone is very nice, it's just we always have to ask for our check and no one ever has checked on us to see if we needed anything. Regardless - I'll be back for the food cuz it's THAT good.",

    "text": "It is and will always be that late night restaurant that is super fast, semi lively, and satisfying. This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \"F**cking Long\" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.  Since I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!  Of course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well.   Girls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention. Real shit, they kind of flirt way too much. I know it's common elsewhere but sometimes.. I just want to eat my food and be treated equally! :\\",

    "text": "I was very skeptical about this place but my husband has been trying to get me here for a year now.  I'm very particular about my pho and have my favorite joint... Until they were on dirty dining!  So I was kinda forced into going here just to see how it was and I checked snhd kitchen inspections beforehand,  they checked out with all A's,  perfect. The parking is kinda a hassle since the lot is so narrow but eh whatever, what do they have to do with that,  not their fault.  Walking in its very spacious and they have some nice big fish tanks to keep my toddler occupied.  However the wait to be seated was too long especially since their was no-one to say that they will be right with you. Once seated though the service was quick and friendly.  I ordered a spicy soup with beef and pigs feet, my husband ordered his typical pho with beef and we  had fried eggrolls to start. The eggrolls were really good, very crispy and flavorful,  my husband and I only got to share one since my toddler loved them he ate the other three. Our soups came and I must say I was pleasantly pleased with my soup, the broth had a lot of depth and was just right on the spicy. I added jalapenos and some garlic chili sauce they brought with my bowl. My husband's soup was just okay, nothing special,  but who cares that was his problem.  I finished it all!  Which never happens, I'm always bringing home leftovers. I'm happy to say that we'll be back and I'm very happy that I found a new place to get my pho fix.  Also the menu has a nice selection for non pho peeps (my older children) .",

In the past I have never ever like any Pho dish I have ordered from any other place. But because I was starving I decided to give this place a try. The waitress saw the doubt in my face, and suggested a pho bowel for me. I said ok, just to get her to leave me alone. This bowel of Pho was soooo good, this waitress and restaurant changed my outlook on Vietnamese cuisine single handedly. Also compared to other places, this restaurant is visibly clean. Wait stuff blows most of the time, but I don't think they are purposely rude, just the way they are.",

    "text": "Based on most of the reviews here it's pretty obvious you don't come here for the service or ambiance. However given that it IS Chinatown service with a smile isn't exactly something you should expect. On Sundays this place can be packed at lunch. You know you're at an authentic Pho restaurant when a good portion of customers can speak the same native language as the staff. But getting down to the soup the Pho is what you'd expect from a Chinatown restaurant: a gianormous serving size, lots of beef, tripe and other goodies and that Vietnamese home-cooked taste. I can't comment on some of the other offerings although when it comes to variety of Pho you can spend a few min sifting through plenty of choices on the menu or just call it as you like since it is (for the most part) made to order. The food is 4 stars but with the disclaimer to just not set your expectations too high with regards to the service.",

    "text": "For all you perverted minded (all of us) let's get it out of our system first and snicker & smirk it off!  Whether you pronounce it correctly or not...it all sounds alike. \"PHO KIM LONG\" ... Yup that's the name of this fine restaurant.  Don't let the name fool you though.  The place has since been remodeled a while back with simple yet beautiful decor & backdrops that really make a difference and give you an ethnic feel to your Vietnamese dining experience.  Whenever one feels the crave for some luscious pho, this place will do justice.  They open early and close late practically open 24 hours...this place is great for lunch with family, a dinner date for two or a cure for your late night hang overs with friends.  In fact Pho Kim Long is great anytime to fill your tummy to satisfaction.    This place can get packed, especially on a weekend at peak hours...so be prepared for the crowd.  A downfall to this is their small waiting area up front.  With very little seating and standing area, this can be and is a fire hazard. But when this happens you know they must be doing something right...to have such an audience of hungry on goers wait amongst each other.    When you do get seated, be excited for once you decide what to order, the food is prepared quick and comes right out.  My favorite Pho here is the combination.  This comes with chewy yet tender tendon that melts right when you chew, also has your usual thin sliced flank raw meat & other goodness...the broth is very soothing and comes packed with flavor.  Their Salt & Pepper Calamari is scrumptious, but eat it fresh and hot as it will get soggy after a while...but still a yummy snack even after.  For those non-pho PHOnatics...they do have rice and other dishes to get your palates tainted with flavor....from pork, to beef, to fish, to even pad thai noodles...they par up pretty well.  My favorite dessert drink here is their Avocado Shake Smoothie with tapioca boba!  They must have atleast 100 pieces of boba....sounds like fillers...but they do give a generous amount of avocado shake in it.  You can also request the shake without boba.  All in all...I may be too generous giving this place a high rating with 5 stars.  Others would disagree with me, as I can understand...I should be giving it only 4 stars because of the waiting area (but only an issue when it is packed) and also because prices here tend to be just a tad bit higher than some close rivals that are side by side comparable in quality,  I do give it 5 stars though because for some reason...I still keep coming back here for more ... rather than 2 others who are in my top 3 of Pho places in Las Vegas.  Don't forget, you can also take out! and Pho Kim Long is very generous in portions!  You may pay a dollar or 2 more, but the portions are respectable and they wont rip you off like some other places:  **COUGH-COUGH(PHO ROSE)COUGH-COUGH**",

I started coming here less than a year ago with my sister and her bf with the recommendation of one of his friends.  Well, I haven't had pho in many years, it was cold, so sure, why not?!  It was very tasty.  I tend to get the same things with each visit. Egg rolls, chicken wings, and small #15.  All very satisfying and hits the spot each time a craving sneaks up on me.  I do have to say, I now find myself craving the wings (with TONS of fried garlic on top) more then the pho. My mouth is starting water just thinking about those crispy, juicy little things.  The baby decided she doesn't like the noodles, so I always get a bowl with a little bit of rice and add the soup for her.  She also, recently, decided she likes the egg rolls too.    I haven't really tried any place else for pho, but I know I should, to see if I really do like it as much as I do.  But for now, this is where I'll be.",

I know we ordered 4 coconut drinks and only 2 came out, so we asked for two more, next thing I knew there were two extras... go figure!  I had the \"pho\" (beef noodle soup) which was a little bland and my husband had the \"bun bo\" (beef with rice vermicelli soup), Husband said, it was so tasteless and flavorless.  And I saw one of my girl friend bowl of \"banh canh ( thick rice noodle seafood soup), she was squirting more and more fish sauce into her bowl, and she added salt and pepper too.    To be save, just order Pho when you come in from a long night of partying, it's soup, it's easy to go down.  Plus all our taste bud off.",

    "text": "This place was just ok for me. I liked the fact that this place is open 24 hours since the other restaurant was just about closing by the time I would've gotten there. That's really the only good thing that stood out to me when I went here. Service wasn't amazingly quick but it wasn't bad. The food though was nothing really amazing and was kinda pricey for pho. I got that as well as other and one pad thai. The pad thai was very good and flavorful but as mentioned pricy for the amount that was given. The thai tea was probably biggest disappointment for me since it nearly half ice as I drank the whole thing so quickly and saw there so much ice, so I'd recommend asking for little or no ice if you get thai tea. Pho was $9 for large bowl which seemed more like a regular bowl at other places and pad thai was $12. Definitely come here for the late hours, but I suggest elsewhere for better Vietnamese food.",

It's like 15 dollars for a freaking bowl of pho!  Anyways, Pho Kim Long has pretty solid pho. It's more expensive than your normal pho, but it's Vegas and when you had a little too much fun clubbing the night before, you can't complain. It's also open 24 hours, so it is quite convenient.  I haven't tried their other food, but they have a huge variety on their menu, including sea food. So whenever you're hungover in Vegas, head over to Pho Kim Long.",

As soon as we sat down I already felt uncomfortable because of the dirty table and floor. Not to mention the fruit flies that we had to keep waving away. We ordered beers right away but they never came. Had to stop a different waiter because ours was nowhere to be found. Even then the beers didn't come. Eventually we got our meals and still no beer, so I got up and walked over to ask. Finally our waiter comes and asks if we still want them  (which we did) and we had our beers halfway thru the entree. The bathrooms were gag worthy so I can't imagine what the kitchen is like. The food is good, maybe order take out instead of dining in.",

The food here was great, they even had Banh Mi sandwiches.  Not too many Vietnamese restaurants offer banh mi.  I ordered a pork bun and shared half a banh mi with one of the guys.  The entire meal was excellent.  The pork on top of the bun was thick and juicy.  This is going to be saved at the back of my mind for future trips to Las Vegas.",

As we ordered out food she let me finish my order and snatched out menu out our hand & didn't even let my friend tell her order so we had to wait till the waiter came back to finish the order. As  the food came out they literally threw out food on our table, and we were so shocked.. but we asked the guy who gave our food for extra lime & he just walked away as we were speaking to him. It just continued the entire time we were there, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ITS RIDICULOUS. As we paid the lady took the cash and didn't return the change expecting she was getting a tip! Sorry but tips shouldn't be expected, you need to earn & basically none of you guys had a good attitude. Horrible experience, never coming back & this is coming from a customer who goes all the time!",

Also have had things like Pad Thai and Shanghai Noodles....ALL DELICIOUS!!!!  Anytime I have a hankering for Pho this is the place I always go.  The portions are out of this world and I'm always walking out like a 9 months pregnant lady doing the waddle.    Now something that you have to understand about Asian restaurants is.......their lack of customer service is kind of a normal thing in the Asian community.  It's a cultural thing that American's aren't used to.  But usually the worse the service the better the food....Just Sayin' But I've never been treated badly or unimportant when I have come into this restaurant.  So it's sad to see these other reviews where they had horrible experiences because I haven't had 1 bad one in the millions of times I've been in here.  But if you want good pho at a great price this is the place to go.  I'm seriously a regular and their staff now knows me....it's a little embarrassing hahahaha.",

We needed some scoops for our pho soup that none of the bowl had come with. We ask for them but the guy/owner didn't even acknowledge me while I am looking at him for about a minute then he asked what do I need. I thought that was insulting. One of the friends ask for some condense milk. The response of the waiter was what do you need it for. That was unnecessary. Because it is open early we like to start our day early. We like to enjoy our precious day here in NV. Thanks Pho Kim Long for ruin our day. Just a friendly reminder for who is looking an enjoyable vacation please avoid this place at all cost. For us we will never come here again. Hope they will learn to share their customer with a little respect. If there is an option with zero star rating. I will rate them zero star rating.

    "text": "This 24 hour place is great. While visiting Vegas with my friends and feeling we didn't want to spend too much, we headed over to this place. The pho noodles are pretty good, though I have had better. Regardless of this little fact this place hits the spot when you have a very late night in Sin City. There's just something about a hot bowl of pho when you are very drunk in Vegas.  The egg rolls are very good. Crunchy and tasty, the sauce on the other hand it's not the best for me, but I'm sure someone out there will love it.  This place always seems to have a line during it's late night operations. Which is understandable, considering that the waiting staff is down to either 1 or 2 people and they are running around like mad to cater to 9-12 different tables with each having a party of 3-7.  The atmosphere and decor is rather simple, nothing chic or upscale. Just your basic run of the mill Vietnamese restaurant. I think I would still go back to this place mostly for tradition, since my friends and I have gone here in all of our Vegas trips.",

    "text": "I have come to this restaurant at least 10 every time I come to Las Vegas.  My take here are decor is ok, so is the food, service is unpredictable, and the prices are varied.      The dining room is buddhist-like temple  theme which is more of a cross between Chinese and Vietnamese.  There are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes.  The fresh water fish tank is nice with expensive variety of fishes. The plants need to be taken care of because they are covered with dust.  The restroom needs to be clean because toilet paper are all over the floor.  By the way they haven't upkept since the remodeling.  The place needs better ventilation because I can smell lot of pho flavors when first entered.        The beef noodle soup here is reasonable.  First, the soup come out really fast.  The broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor, which is typical.  I prefer a balance flavor broth.  The price for the beef noodle soup is fair.  The seafood soup here is overpriced because the content in the soup are 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 fishballs, 3 slices of cuttlefish, and egg noodle in a blanched broth.  The BBQ duck is tasty which has a balance flavor of crispy skin, duck with fair amount of meat,  and good price.      The service is unpredictable.  They have all male servers with a serious look on their faces most of the time.  You have to ask for service. One upswing is  they give you the right utensil for your needs.  The 17% gratuity is added with five or more in your party.  Since there is not much service that seems rediculous.  You can't split check, boomer.   Their non-alcohol prices are more than their beers.  Might as well order a beer for your thirst.  One more thing,  the servers dress in a nice tunic-like shirt which I thought stand out.",

She felt the need to come tell US to keep our baby laughter down :-/ REALLY?? The people that had the children RUNNING around didn't have a word said to them. Plus this restaurant is not a quiet place at all so I have no idea what got up her butt :-/ This kept us away for awhile then we decided to pop back in and we haven't seen that girl since so we happily came back :-) I actually would give this place 5 stars if the workers are a little friendlier and the service was better. If your a thirsty person plan on staying that way because its hard to get the workers attention for another beverage.",

    "text": "This place was off the beaten path and somewhere off of the strip but what a great find.  There was about 9 of us that popped in here around 4 am on a Friday night...and all of us left here with a smile on our face.  that's a tough task to accomplish after drinking for 16hrs straight, getting your ass kicked at every game at the casinos and leaving Rhino with mad blue balls...but somehow Pho Kim Long had that right receipe.    The pork chops were so ridiculous that we had to order another order as soon as we all sampled a bite. The pho (I had the chicken) was awesome, probably one of the best that I have had. And this place served us BEER at 4 AM, now that's outstanding.   For a late, late night joint the place was clean and the atmosphere was classy and inviting.  we were in awe of some of the fish that were swimming around in their fish tank or maybe it was the two hotties reflection off of the aquarium that all nine of us were taking glances at, remember we just left Rhino.  But none the less, if you are in need of a hangover fix or something to soak up all the booze, definately get a bowl of Pho, here. all the gambling wounds, phony temptations of banging a stripper and regretful short term memories that flash back from the evening will dissappear once you get involved in a bowl of pho. I know us 9 rowdy guys found a moment of bliss just by the shear silence of words replaced by the sounds of slurp.  That lasted about a minute.",

I didn't get 1 meatball, not even 1/2, but I got 1/4 of a meatball. not 1 meatball cut into 4 pieces, I literally just got 1/4 of a meatball.. this place is pretty good, but make sure they don't rip you off. :p",

    "text": "First off, my sister and her husband love this place.  They rave about it and it's authenticity and that it's open 24 hours.  Their rating on it is exactly why I took my girlfriend out to it after a night at a ballet.  It was a Saturday night, and we were promptly seated.  I was happy about this, but they sat us at a nearly 8 person round.  Kind of odd and peculiar, but we were hungry so the size of the table didn't bother us.  We started with spring rolls, a favorite appetizer of hers.  They were good.  Hard to mess those up, and I can say they didn't do that.  Our waiter became the center of attention during our private conversation.  He didn't say much, just got our order and left.  He essentially threw our drinks and Pho down when he served it.  I know it was a busy night, but he just seemed completely disinterested in his job.  Several times he came to our table to fill supplies at other tables with customers.  He'd grab five or six spoons from our table, and put them on another table.  He took some chopstix and fill the empty holder on another.  Eventually we overheard others also noting his absent charm.  Where they found him to be a waiter is beyond me.  He should be retrained on how to do his job, or be demoted to customer.  Our Pho was eventually served to us and we both began eating.  She ordered the chicken and I ordered the brisket.  As far as flavors went, I didn't notice anything out of the norm.  Neither did she.  I finished my Pho, and she asked for a to go container.  When she asked for it, the busser sarcastically joked and said it would be $5 and just for that I felt compelled to tip beyond the lack of service.  She got the container and we left.  She noted that the waiter, seemingly looking for a larger tip he didn't earn, when he picked up the bill flipped us off upon our exit.  Very classy for an establishment named after a sexual innuendo.  When she went to have the remaining Pho at our home, SHE FOUND A WATER BUG FLOATING AND FLICKING ITS LEGS ACROSS THE PHO bouncing its body off of the container's inner foam walls.  To the trash her pho went....as well as their reputation in our household.",

The staff was attentive and we had several people swing by the table to make sure we were doing OK.  The menu is impressive, I was just expecting your average Pho place, but they menu covers much more, apps, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and much much more.  I decided on the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho. I also got an order of the Chinese Doughnuts to start.  My only complaint is that the doughnuts were plain, when I usually order them they're covered in sugar, but a little quick thinking and I was using the remaining Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls for a great dish.  The Food came out insanely fast, the apps were good, but the Pho stole the show. The Steak and Brisket were both tender and delicious. The noodles were plentiful, and the broth was rich.  I will be going back without a doubt!",

As a restaurant, it is their job to protect their customers and this was not protecting my family and the others that were getting affected by this rowdy group.  Note: when five tables complain to you about a certain table, it's time to do something there, instead of going over to the table and watch them until they stop doing whatever they were doing and then repeat what they were doing when you're gone.

    "text": "Every time I'm in a asian restaurant, customer service is something I don't expect.  It almost goes hand in hand.  Asian restaurant = bad customer service.   Pho Kim Long has bad customer service.  It's expected, so I won't dwell on it. The first time I came, I was with a party of 5.  One of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup.  How that happens,  I can only imagine. I tried the Pho, I asked for egg noodles and got rice noodles.  I then asked the waiter where my egg noodles were he replied with \"Are you sure you ordered egg noodles?\"  I was there just yesterday and I must say that the Pho isn't all that great.  I had pan fried noodles and I received a plate that was drenched in sauce.  When my pan fried noodles are drenched in sauce, there really isn't a point to order pan fried noodles.   I've had the chicken teriyaki and it was okay.  Teriyaki Madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as Pho Kim Long.  I notice this place is voted best in Vegas, however it must be voted by non asian people as this restaurant is full of non asians and even the asians that review this place don't give it a good review.",

The pork chop rice was unimpressive at best. The single pork chop was small and a bit on the tough side. The egg cake that came with it however was delicious. Really good service considering how busy they were. The food came out incredibly fast, we were in and out of there within half an hour including wait time for the table. The place was packed and I did notice 90% of the customers were having pho and nothing else. Can't say that I blame them.",

    "text": "I actually wanted to give this place two stars because I really don't care for it, but I realize it's a popular place and there must be good reason for that. It may be that I just don't care much for pho in general, so I'm hard to please when it comes to the subject.   Based on the outrageous line that exists nearly every time I've been there, be it 8pm or 4am, this is a definitely a hot spot in town. Fortunately, there were only two of us so we were sat quickly. The hostess seemed annoyed at the amount of ppl waiting for tables and was just wanting to get everyone out of the waiting area, so she barely made eye contact, and a smile was entirely out of the question.   The server possessed the same quality of indifference toward us. I realize this place is probably quantity-driven versus quality-driven, so I tried not to let the poor service bother me too much. He only came by when it was time to order, and we had to flag him down for a refill on soda. Honestly, the \"water-refill guy\" was more attentive than our server.   The food was mediocre, but again, that could be because I don't have much of an affinity for pho. The broth was pretty bland, so I found myself continuously adding to it throughout the meal. Even though I ordered my pho with rare steak, I only had about 3 pieces of meat in my entire bowl. Incredibly disappointing. I will say the shrimp and pork spring rolls we had as an appetizer were delicious, however. Better than the soup, in my opinion.   It took awhile for us to get our credit card slips back after giving them to the server to pay. A tad annoying since we were in a hurry.   Overall, I don't plan on returning here anytime soon, BUT if you are a pho lover who doesn't mind bad service and are just there for the food, this might be the place for you! Again, I know it's one of the most popular places in the city, and there must be a reason for that, right?",

I can't taste the beef broth that is supposed to be cooked for hours to develop this deep flavor, added with the specific spice that gives pho this mouthwatering aroma. And that's unacceptable for a place that is opened 24/7. You should be able to monitor and develop the flavor of your broth. The beef is cut so thinly, I was expecting soft and flavorful. Nope, I assume you have to freeze your beef in order to cut it this thinly and somehow they've manage to lose all the flavor from the meat. I felt like I was eating \"soggy meat\". Did that sound nasty to you? Yes? It was. My fatty flank, there were two pieces with decent fat on it that gave my one spoon of noodle flavor because I scarcely used any soup. The rest of my fatty flank was chewy. The meatball? NEVER. Like no. The taste was not utterly unbearable, but the texture was wrong.   Ps. My bf says the restroom is disgusting. I'm more of a germaphobe, so this coming from him holds more accuracy.",

Quic Tip: If it's packed, and you don't want to wait for a table, you can order your food to go, it's faster! Also you can even call ahead and they can have your order ready for you by the time you get there. Oh and if you are planning to go there on Sunday for dinner, be prepared to wait!  I always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. I think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here. My fave dishes are the grilled pork chop, salted fish fried rice, calamari and wonton noodle soup.",

We came in a group of 8 (automatic gratuity) and were seated immediately. Waters came out quickly and we got our orders and food almost instantly as well. The waiter seemed to rush us a bit but hey, I wasn't complaining since we were late anyway.   I got the #15 - steak & brisket ($7.50) - and added meatballs on the side ($1). The broth is soo flavorful, it actually tasted worse once I doused my soup in sriracha & hoisin sauce (my usual routine) which is pretty crazy for a pho place if you ask me. The steak is cooked with a little pink in the middle and the noodles are chewy, not soggy like a lot of places. It is a bit pricey for a pho place, but the quality is what you're paying for.  I honestly can't tell if this is one of the best phos I've ever had, or if I was just that hungry. I was planning on coming back on my last day in Vegas but it took us near 3 hours to get out of the damn speedway parking lot...   So until next time, Pho Kim Long.",

The broth is pretty good, salty and flavorful, the way I like it. The meat was kind of chewy though, that's the only drawback.",

Hubby ordered the special (dac biet) for $7.25 and I ordered a large bowl of the raw beef with tendon also for $7.25. We also ordered the plain noodle with broth for $5.00, spring rolls and egg rolls for the children.The bowls came full of broth and tender meat, but a disportionate amount of soggy noodles. I told my server that hubby and my bowl did not have enough noodles and they said that's how it's served. So we each order another serving of noodles for $3.00. Spring rolls were puny...really puny for $5.00, about 30% smaller than what you would get in a typical food joint. The egg rolls were super greasy, so greasy I had to roll them into the napkins before I served them to my children. I asked for hot tea, the hot tea never came, but the ice water that I never ordered arrived. The bill came out to be $38 and some change with tip included. (You don't get a choice.) I voiced my disatisfaction with another server who I thought was a manager and then the owner. They just said sorry and did nothing to ameliorate the situation. Overall, the food is ok, but it's expensive considering Vegas is the most wasteful place on earth with all the buffets. If you're really craving for Pho, then it will meet your basic needs, but I would recommend you pass and just go to your local favorite joint.",

    "text": "If it was possible to rate this place a -1, I would. My boyfriend and I always liked coming here until our last visit. We noticed over time the food hasn't been as good, and the service is probably the worst I've ever had. But this visit was the last straw. A friend and I got to the restaurant to grab a table for our party of 7. The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated immediately, but it took our server 18 minutes before I could flag him down just for a drink order. I even timed it because the service there the last few times hasn't been its best. Mind you it wasn't busy compared to its usual hectic environment. We got our drinks and our friends arrived, we were finally ready to order and no one came back to our table for another 20 mins. We had to stop another server and ask him to take our order because apparently our server decided to clock out and was hanging out in the back of the restaurant in his wife beater watching everyone eat like a damn creep. Everyone ordered either an app or just an entree. Not too much food like we usually do. I ordered the chicken pad thai. Everyone got their food except for me. After everyone else got their food, no one else stopped by our table. I got up to tell someone to take what I ordered off the bill because I no longer wanted it. He said ok and walked to the back. A few mins later he came out with my order in a to go box. I told him AGAIN that I no longer wanted it because it took too long. We had to ask 3 different people for our check and that took over 10 mins to get. I honestly don't understand how management can allow such horrible service to their customers. We're no longer coming to this restaurant for any reason what so ever.",

Not what we wanted to hear especially since we were hungry. He took his time and never really checked on us.  Good thing the other wait staff brought out our food.....and in no particular order.  We had our fried rice brought out to us like 10 min before the rest of our dishes.  What good is that?  Good thing it was yummy.  We then had to get white rice which they now charge for, to have with our entrees.  We had the honey walnut shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops, and crispy noodles with beef and brocolli.  Everything was great!  I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something comforting to eat off the strip.  Price wise....we were around in mid 20s per person for about 4 shared dishes and drinks....(smoothie, and thai iced tea).",

I wish I could get late-night pho in Seattle, though this isn't the best, as it is pretty good and fills that need! The service isn't phenomenal, the food isn't spectacular, but Pho Kim Long delivers what you want at odd hours, even, and it's pretty affordable, as is typical for pho.

Life does exist off the strip and it's damm good   Always bring friends to this spot  Always order egg rolls Always leave satisfied :)",

Their food is extremely great and their prices don't even compare to how great the food is.  It being open 24/7 is a huge plus, since it's a great spot to get something late at night.",

While the service is quite fast, it's not the most personable but does that really matter after a night of clubbing and being slightly less than sober?

One of the high points about this place is that it's open 24 hours. I have not yet discovered any other Vietnamese restaurant that is open for 24 hours, so this is a great place for those who are looking to have a filling, healthy dinner after your long night shift.   I can understand why the quality of the pho might not be comparable to some other places (the broth is a little different here than others), but the reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because I would [highly] recommend anyone to be adventurous with the menu. It's typical to order spring rolls, eggrolls, and your pho, but really... there's so much more to the menu than you think, don't be afraid, trust me!  We ordered rice, the deep fried flounder, walnut shrimp, and coconut milk to go with the meal, and it was quite possibly one of the most flavorful seafood meals I've ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant. I'm usually hesitant with seafood when it comes to restaurants that are reasonably priced and are local establishments, but I have to say the seafood here was fresh, flavorful, and filling.   The dining area is spacious, not tightly packed together, and the ambience of the restaurant is nice and cultural. Might I add they also have a little selection of liquors from their drink menu too?",

At times you will get skipped and they will seat larger parties because of course the more heads the more money. As your seated you will have a server rush up to you within a few short minutes trying to rush you for an order and if your not ready they won't came back for it for the longest time. Once ordered if you did order any soups such as pho than they will have it out within a few minutes because it's the easiest to serve. So half the table will have their food and the other half won't for a good wait. After the food is dropped off you will not get any attention at all from the servers for refills or anything at all. Expect to constantly ask for whatever you need. The pho is a hit or miss, there's days that it's okay other days it's just flat out too oily. Very busy place , but way over hyped! Everyone talks about how good this place is but my personal opinion of the food here is obviously alright.",

My friend and I went to the cashier to pay for our bill via card and the man had the audacity to ask where the tip was...first off cash tip was left on the table but the fact that he was so rude about it I walked right over to the table and picked the tip back up.

We're always looking to add good places to eat since we've been living in this \"foodie\" town going on 24 years. Tourist is always asking him about good places to eat and he will definitely tell many about this place. The biggest downer is the parking. It's the main reason I don't come in that right area.",

The noodles are awesome, I don't know how but I really can not get tired of the pho noodles they have here. The meat variety is good. The service is pretty fast once you get seated.

The servers are busy but they always come by to help you and are super efficient. I usually order their Pho Tai Chin or Pho Tai, depending on whether I want the cooked beef, and boy is it good! Regardless of the large or small bowl, they give you great portions of noodles, meat, and soup so you never really run out of anything. I'm typically a glutton when it comes to soup, so I like to order the large bowl (the menu doesn't always list the large bowl, so ask if you want it!)  I haven't tried their Com Tam dishes but seeing other people's food, it looks just as tasty!",

To my dismay, the Vietnamese rice platter was smaller and more expensive than most other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to.   At the end of our quick dining experience, our server handed us the check and quickly told us that \"tip wasn't included\" in our bill. Honestly, it made me feel very uneasy, because it was as if she assumed we weren't going to tip. Also, the check even had a guideline on what to tip... so, I didn't think it was necessary for her to tell us that the tip wasn't included.   Just saying.",

Long story short, food really was just average and the service was good until the bill came and faces turned inside out.  The waitress that had been nice and helpful all night long basically told my non-english speaking father \"the tip is not included, (points to the 20%option) is this okay?\"  What??? I have never been asked to tip like this. Whatever she assumed where my family was from she should have never asked for tips like this. I don't care if it was late night, because we would have tipped her and the staff nicely until she obliterated the nice experience we were having.  What made this worse is when we barely stepped our foot out of the door and they didn't greet us with the same manner as when we arrived (maybe because we didn't agree to the 20%) and immediately went up to our table to see how much we tipped. We still tipped around 18%.  FFS I know you guys work hard but I would never recommend anyone to come visit your restaurant because of this type of behavior.  Hopefully you guys can understand how unpleasant this can be for a customer and improve yourselves. I really hate being treated this way and I'm sure others will too.",

However, during my last visit, it is sad to say that the quality of food here has gone down tremendously. Not only the quality of food but the service as well.  I was fine waiting for an hour in exchange of a quality food and service, but this time everything was not how I remembered this place.   I ordered spring rolls, my usual beef stew, and beef ball pho. None of the items wowed me. The beef stew had so much tendons and meet was not cooked well (see pictures). The egg noodles were too soggy, not fresh! The spring rolls were a joke! The shrimps are so tiny and only placed on one side (see picture).  My fav Viet restos serve big rolls with big shrimps and placed on both sides of the roll.  On top of that veggie was not that fresh.  I like the peanut sauce tho! Both soups had meat that looks old (shiny surface, orange and green color), yuck!  The service, boo! Did not even check on us one bit. And they forgot my hot water request.  Ill still come back next time and try the rice dishes, since I did not  get one this time. Ill stay away from the soups!",

    "text": "Ah, Fuck Him Long. My posse's current late-night dining obsession. I am no pho expert, and as a matter of fact, I order bun and not pho, but I find this place to be only OK. On our most recent visit, our table ordered together, and my #32 didn't come until everyone was done eating and we inquired about it. It's on the pricey side for pho...most dishes around $9-12. The shrimp spring rolls are popular with my krew, as are the rolls with the shredded pork skin, but I'm not particularly fond of either, especially considering the price. Service is OK at best. Decor is nice, almost classy, even. They're open late, and they're pretty close to the freeway, which are very good things. I'm not in love with the place, but some of my more pho-knowledgeable friends are very fond of it. I'll continue to go, but I'm definitely keeping my eye out for something better, or at least cheaper.  PRO-TIP: They won't split checks, so if dining with a group, bring cash.",

The place was well put together, the pho is more expensive than what i'm used to paying to back in my area, but I was not disappointed! The service was SO fast and I really liked the broth.. I ordered pho GA as usssual and I enjoyed the strips of chicken and onion and cilantro. The place was clean.. Even the bathrooms. The place closes at 3am which is pretty good time considerin it's in vegas.",

We visited around 9pm on a Sunday night and the place was adequately busy for a 24-hour joint. We got waters quickly and our pho came out in a matter of minutes. The broth was ok; saltier and less flavorful than the pho I've ever had before. I'm partial to deep, hearty, anise-infused broths that don't need hoisin or sriracha for enhancement. Needless to say, I was let down. On the bright side, I was happy to find something 5 minutes away from the strip, even if it's located in a strip mall decorated by a fake Chinatown facade.   Two stars for the pho, but I thought the service was fine and the bathroom was surprisingly not filthy.",

Surely this is better than any of the Pho I've had in DC, though curiously, the best pho I've ever had was in my home town of Syracuse, NY, not the most cosmopolitan place, I know.

Had their BBQ pork appetizer which was great, good quality.  Then had a couple of beef dishes, Mongolian beef and the cubed beef.  Both great.  Place got the food out pretty fast too.

The ONLY reason I'm giving them a one-star rating is because I can't give them any lower.  Went with my family, I ordered a plate of chicken wings, they ordered some other stuff. Fast forward, everyone else has their food, I assume that my wings are taking long because they have to fry them up, sounds reasonable right?  We ask them where my wings are and they say they're coming, and I don't wanna be THAT guy who keeps asking where his order is, so I continue waiting.  Fast forward again, everyone is done eating, my wings are nowhere to be found, so we ask them about it again. Turns out they didn't even start working on the wings until that moment, the SECOND time we had to ask them about it.  So because we're fed up of waiting and I'm tired from a whole day of driving, we tell them to just cancel the wings.  Seconds later, guy comes out to my table with a plate of wings, so we figure since they're out, we'll just pay for them and take them to-go. Nope, cashier gets defensive and very RUDELY tells us we can't buy the wings anymore, tells his waiter to go grab the plate right as I'm about to grab a wing.  Never coming here again, and definitely WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone else.  If you're in the Las Vegas area and looking for some great Vietnamese cuisine (I would know, I'm Vietnamese), I'd recommend you SKIP this place, and take the time to drive a little further down the road (same street actually), and eat at Pho So 1 (literally translated as #1 Pho) instead.

I said no thank you and he look angry and he asked \" What you mean no tip??\" And I told him are you question why he's said \"yes was it bad service did you not enjoy the food because if that's the case I don't think you should come back\". Very shocking I said really you would go to a restaurant get bad service and bad food and leave a tip and he stayed quit. Then he begins yelling in the restaurant \" thanks for not leaving a tip\" I yelled back thanks for the horrible food and service.  How rude was that very bad.

We went out searching for a Vietnamese restaurant that my cousin's wife said she really enjoyed on their last trip here, but neither of them remembered the name nor the exact location so we ended up here.  I ordered the bun bo hue and I assume mine must have been the best because everyone else had a complaint about their order.  I thought the bun bo hue was ok, not great.  I asked for shredded cabbage and they didn't have any.  How can they not have cabbage?  The three people who had pho said that it had too much MSG so their stomach felt funny afterwards.  Auntie Bev had pan fried noodles with seafood and she said her dish didn't have much flavor.  The last few times I came here was because they were the only place opened after 2 AM, so I didn't set any expectation.  How did they get named best restaurant in Las Vegas?  I would never know...",

As far as I know this is the only joint in America that expects a tip for pickup orders. I actually tipped them for over two years for pickup. One time I didn't tip and they put me in as \"BAD\" and stopped taking my calls.  I always got #24, the chicken Vermicelli and I can tell you they don't make it fresh. It's always cold. They make the ingredients at some point during the day and then just throw them together as orders come in. Don't get me wrong, it was still good enough for 4AM when most places are closed which is why I kept coming back. But they can go screw themselves now.",

    "text": "The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night especially since we arrived after midnight. We walked in and waited at the front for like 10 minutes before someone even noticed us, still no biggie I'm sure they were very busy. We were seated and a girlfriend of mine and I decide to split a dish. We order the number 66 which is a noodle dish with chicken. Well our meal comes out and it looks NOTHING like the photo. So when our waiter came and asked how everything was, I was honest and said I was hoping to get this (pointing to picture) not this (pointing to my plate). He then goes and gets the manager. And this asshole comes over and tries to convert me to eat the meal. He asked what was wrong, And I explained and said if it's a big deal just forget it but I was wondering if I can trade this for a chicken pad thai instead. He then asks me to eat a piece of chicken and noodle, and I said well, it just doesn't look appetizing to me and I would rather not. But he insisted, getting more and more impatient. I hesitated for a good couple seconds before succumbing to this awkward situation and ate a piece of chicken and noodle for his pleasure while everyone at my table stared at me. I then told him I still didn't like it and would like a pad Thai instead. And he finally removed the dish. And they brought my pad Thai which was much better and the only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars. The Food is good, and if you don't mind impatient, patronizing staff, you will get what you pay for, maybe... IF i come back, it will only be to get the pad Thai. Since I now know that it lives up to its photo and description on their menu.",

    "text": "TLTR:(Guy at register tried to pressure me into paying more tip than I wanted, I refused , Jerk berates and harassed me and my family as we walk out, yelling things across the room).  Me and my wife had been going to this place to eat with our family about once every two months for years, But never again. On our second to last visit the cashier/manager     ( whom some other reviewers have posted pictures of)     insisted that I give 10% tip I usually give a bit below that     (I know it's not a great tip, but if you have ever been served here then you know their service is bad they do the bare minimum and most of the time with a bad attitude but we had overlooked that because the food was decent)    That time I caved and gave the tip the guy insisted on.  I left the place very unhappy. But desided to give the place the benefit of the doubt .. fast forward a couple of months to this morning, and I'm there again with my family. But this time I'm determined to only give the tip I want not what the cashier/manager demands. So I go to pay and again the guy insists I give a larger tip than what I want. I insist I only want to give what I want. We go back and forth a bit until the guy finally caves. That's when the jerk follows me to my table where my family is waiting for me, he proceeds to yell out to the servers near us what my bill was and how much I tipped! Very rude.. I tell my wife lets get out of here. Then to top it of as we are leaving he yelled something at me from a across the room.. my wife noticed and she went over to the register and told the guy that what he was doing was very unprofessional and that if that is how he treated his customers. He could not care less and was very cocky about the whole thing. Safe to say we are never going back there again. I have no problem with a mandatory gratuity fee for parties over a certain size as long as you are notified beforehand .. but this place try's to muscle/con you out of your money. This guy thinks he can act like this with no consequences but I got news for you buddy keep acting like this and it won't be long before customers start abandoning this place in droves like we have.. there are to many good restaurants in Vegas to be putting up with that kind of shit.",

I've tried some other items besides the Pho such as the roast duck and BBQ pork, and I suggest that if you want that just go to a place that specializes in it. But if at 4am you're craving some pad thai, roast duck, and calamari rings then this place has you covered.  They do have some pretty tasty items such as the salt and pepper calamari, spring rolls and egg rolls. But the main star here is the Pho, I like to get it with brisket and flank.  I've read other's reviews about this place and one of them gave a 1 star for terrible food and poor service. Which I'll admit, a few times I've come in and they weren't on their game with the broth, or I've experienced somewhat terrible servic. But that's because usually it's packed and people are just waiting to get a table and with a full house, it can get crazy for the staff.  I've been coming here for a long time now, and overall for the price and taste, it's great in your stomach and easy on the wallet.  Side note! Pho will cure your hangover. My buddy and I had ours cured, results may vary though from person to person.",

When it was our turn, she just led us to the table and threw the menu on the table and left.

I did like the fried tofu and coconut and that's why I'm keeping two stars here; however, the spring rolls was not fresh and the soup base for their Bun Bo Hue was so bland, it didn't have pork blood or beef/brisket in them either.

N the same stupid Server served us. \"HUE\" THIS TIME SHE DID IT AGAIN! she told our friend the same thing N point it at the suggested % tips. He went pay it with his card N will leave a CASH TIPS  FOR HER. I WAS pissed because she did it again with us so I took the receipt  N go talk to the cashier guy.  I asked if I can talk to the owner or the manager there. But in that meanwhile that girl HUE was there too N she was going through some of the receiptS there .I didn't think anything of it. Any how the cashier pointed it out the manager \"BANG\" there so I went over N talked  to BANG. N HIS respondS was even more disappointed. HE said that she is doing that because some people don't know how to tips so she needs to do that to ensure their tips. SO HE SAID   \" WHAT IS YOUR POINT\" WOW! REALLY.... ?  During that moment the server HUE went back to our table  N LOOK AT THE TIPS N WENT  WENT BACK TO THE CAHSIER N GET THE CREDIT CARD RECEIPT N show my husband N our other 8 people that were THERE N circle the tips part N said   The bill is not going to close out until the percentage of tips should be pay..\" Remember we will leave a Cash tips for her so why would we leave any tips on our Card....  I know we shouldn't leave any tips at all... but we still leave her SOME... BUT IF SHE DIDN'T OPEN HER MOUTH N DID WHAT SHE DID SHE WOULD GET AT LEAST $20 IN TIPS... BUT THIS WILL BE OUR LAST TIME GOING THERE.... WE COULDN'T BELIEVE EVEN THE MANAGER \" BANG\" DIDN'T FIND IT RUDE AT ALL... I hope the OWNER WILL READ THIS N WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT A WAY TO run your business N please contact me coz I would love to have a talk with u. Coz this is EXTREMELY RUDE. N WE DIDN'T EVEN GET AN APOLOGY FROM THE MANGER ALSO.COZ OBVIOUSLY HE AGREED WITH HIS EMPLOYEES BEHAVIOR.",

I can't put into words how the service sucks.  The first time I was here, my family and I were seated in the back corner. Workers and waiters went back and forth our table but never paid attention. I mean we were obviously in the corner, but seriously.. what the hell? We got our food and all and then my sister felt sick. Instantly, she blacked out and my mom hurried and ordered a lemon soda to help her. It took forever to come and none of the waiters cared. I mean, even customers walking by the go to the restroom saw her unconscious and asked if she was okay. Such workers..   Food wasn't even great. The pho was watery and the bun bo hue was bland. I did enjoy my Rotisserie Chicken though but it's so not worth my time waiting and not worth my time dealing with the workers.   Second time I came here, and OH MY GOSH... bad bad bad. My family was separated into two tables. I mean that's fine with us. The other table had 4 adults and were seated and served immediately. Like I mean they got the food before my table ordered fast.. In my table had 3 adults and 4 kids. I guess we looked like teenagers and so this was where the service began sucking. We flagged down at least 4 workers to take our orders. While taking our orders, the man was being so fucking rude. Excuse my language but I'm pretty sure it's because we looked young. Our food took awhile to get to us too.. the other table were done eating and my cousin didn't even get her food yet. It was reallllly bad. They also gave the other table their check too. I'm sure everyone knows what it means when the restaurant gives you your check right? It's the universal language to LEAVE. Uhhh why would they pay and leave if more than half their party was still eating? Like what? Then they got mad because my aunt questioned it. I can't express how rude and uncomfortable we felt. I knew they were annoyed so honestly one more gesture or request would result in them spitting into our food.   IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET OUR CHANGE BACK. I am one to never leave less tip but I can't help but tip them bad. Honestly, this place needs a reality check. I'm really curious why they're so packed all the time.  Parking can be a bitch as the parking is shared amongst several other restaurants and stores.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

After all, with a name like Pho Kim Long, you might think this is the Las Vegas Chinatown equivalent to the Chicken Ranch.   You might also forget that you have already slurped on the savory dishes here.   Pho Kim Long is a popular Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California's Viet hot spots.   They do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven't tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men's lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton's minds.",

The next day I come to pick up my stroller they said that someone has already came in to pick it up and that it's not there fault the stroller was left there and it was out of there hands.

I usually get the combination pho, and you get a plate of sprouts, lime and mint leaves on the side so you can add as much as you like. I wish they had more options like a seafood combination pho like the pho place I used to go to when I lived California, but this place will do. Coming from the Bay Area, you have an array of Vietnamese restaurants that are bomb. This place came close, but no cigar. That's why this place didn't get 5 stars because I have tried better, and once you get a taste of the good stuff, none can compare.

    "text": "I used to go to this place before it was popular. I went there before all the fish tanks and nice floors and what not. Seriously when they first started out they had missing squares in the ceiling. No problem the food was very good and I loved that they were 24hrs. The first Vietnam soup house in town to go 24hrs before others and now I see others staying open till 3am.  My problem with them that sent me over the top was for only 2 dollars. I was kinda upset with them anyway since they got so popular that they did not care about the locals anymore like in years past. So my problem was about the charge for meat on the side. I asked my server and the cashier before I asked for meat on the side like I always do and they promised me that I would not be charged. I get the bill and ofcourse they charge me for it. Now the manager is a bit rude to me and says that it is listed right on the menu in small print. I agree with that after seeing it and only complain that 2 of your employees said I would not be charged. He refused to take the 2 dollars off of my bill and I was furious. I paid with my CC which was the smartest thing I did.   I disputed the charge on my CC account and Pho Kim Long did not dispute. So they ended up paying for my last meal which was nice but I really do not understand why a business would risk my loyalty for 2 dollars. I remember when meat on the side and a side bowl of broth was free but they got a little too big and greedy for my patronage.  I used to bring all my family and friends over there on a regular basis but not anymore. My 2 top choices for Pho now in the city is Pho Saigon on the top of the hill on spring mtn first, but they close at 10pm. My second choice is the first one I ever went to which is beside the big lots on the corner or Spring Mtn and Decatur, another Pho Saigon 1.  The best is when I make this soup on my own. It has taken a few years to get it right but now it only costs me $1.75 for a bowl of Pho with Beef and Noodles. Ofcourse the Vietnam Coffee that I make costs only pennies compared to the usual 3 dollars any other place charges.",

The house was almost 80 percent full but we were promptly seated. Here is what we ordered:  1. Spring rolls with no pork: I love these. Slightly smaller, but flavorful with sweet tender shrimp and the obligatory peanut dipping sauce. My bf wasn't too please but then again, he might have been eating in his sleep.  2. Pho with flank and rare steak: The broth is the winner hear, flavorful and oily. The meat and noodle was standard. Nick said he prefers more and better meat, but I was more than pleased with the noodle and broth.   3. Lots, lots, lots, of water.  Everything totaled around $21.00.

Then I thought about it I'm not leaving tips usually I leave like 20% of service but it sucks so it's whatever then when I went to pay it I gave 52 bucks coz the total was 42bucks and the cashier didn't give back my change so I have to ask for it .. I mean it's rude not to give back your change without asking and it's by choice if you wanna leave tips but since it's bad service enough and esp this happened I really don't go to this place but I gave it a chance and they blew it so I'm not coming back anytime soon or forever lol smh ..",

It can get busy at different times during the day, but the service is always very good, considering.  I always order the Pho Ga, for the pure simplicity & deliciousness of it ;) I have tried other things on the menu as well, but this is the dish that gives me the warm & fuzzies. Imagine consuming a bowl of hugs & that is what this dish is for me.  Anytime is the right time for Pho!",

    "text": "Before a concert my boyfriend brought me here as a first pho time eater. It's located in the heart of Chinatown on spring mountain. Parking was a pain but we managed to get one (not like there's a lot of space in Chinatown). Walked in and the place was pretty busy, about a 10 minute wait, not so bad.  Once we were seated the waiter took our order. We got the flank and brisket pho with an order of combination fried rice. Since I had never eaten pho before my boyfriend made my bowl for me. It came with a plate covered with greens to brighten up the dark brothed soup. I did add everything to it and also added a few dashes of chili sauce to have a kick. My goodness, this soup was uh mazing. The broth was hot but not lava and they are not stingy with meat. The bowl is big enough for my boyfriend and I to share and so was the rice. The rice was nice also, had plenty of chicken and shrimp the order is huge.   The check with both the rice and soup (drinks also) was under $25 how can you go wrong. Left stuffed but satisfied. Been here a few times more because no other pho joint has been this good. The only reason I took off one star is because the service is very slow and sometimes you have to call for someone to seat you or take your order. I understand you're busy but they need to become more organized.",

Anyway this places other food is decent, spring rolls are the only thing that Id say are subpar, but really, its all about the PHO PHO PHO.   Im from SF, lived in LA and now Vegas, and this place is it. Everyone has heard of it. Its like an Asian mecca, every girl I meet goes here and late night its a stripper haven. One time I was waiting on Pho to go and a girl dropped a dub in front of me. My girl was sitting on my lap and she saw it first. Shes from Vegas so instead of doing something kind, she tapped me and let me be the moral judge (sorry XTI but we all know u aint readin this...) anyway, I grabbed it  and tapped the girl. She turned around and it was a stripper from my work in SF. (I actually got fired because of her and her amazing butt) We laughed embarassingly and said hi. After exchanging pleasantries I mentioned my life and nodded at the guamanian in my lap and the convo halted (still kicking myself for thatttt) Point is, this place holds it down and word spreads. Good, late, cheap., clean granite tables, huge fishtanks...great place to have a mellow meal. Just wash your hands after that Jalepeno.",

Since we weren't very hungry and were there basically to entertain some friends and recommend something \"new\" to them, we shared the grilled porkchops and baked egg. We've tried this dish at other Vietnamese restaurants before and we definitely recommend ordering the sunny side up eggs instead. The porkchops we're cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The baked egg resembled a mini quiche. No real complaints just a matter of preference. Our friends loved the pho.",

If I had to compare it to the Pho in the Bay Area then no, it doesn't compare. But just being able to have a bowl of decent pho after a long night adds some stars.   Rice dishes aren't bad.

It is also open 24hrs, so if you are craving Pho at 300am, this place is open.    I started with the fresh spring rolls.  It was bland and tasteless.  The rice wrap was soft, so that is a plus, but even with the peanut sauce, it did not stand up to a good tasting fresh shrimp spring roll.  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue.  It was actually pretty tasty.  You get to add the spice to it yourself, so the broth is to your liking.  Each bite had meat, tendon and they also included the pig knuckle (which I like in my Bun Bo Hue.)  I would order it again.  The noodles were thick and cooked right.  It was a good bowl of Spicy noodles, but for $9, it better be good.  The total bill was $15, a bit overpriced for an underwhelming experience.  Would I repeat?  Yes.  I would just order the Bun Bo Hue or try the Pho next trip.",

First of let me say that I work overnights, so when I get off at 5am my options are extremely limited. Pho Kim Long is probably the healthiest option if i want to eat out. The place is always clean but the service is lacking. Usually one person takes your order, another brings you the drink (a lot of the time after receiving food), another brings you the food.  The food always comes out in random order. Sometimes the Pho comes out first, sometimes the entrees. Sometimes it takes forever and sometimes its quick.  Because I've been there at least 20 times I've tried a lot on the menu, but not everything (the menu is extensive).   The combination pho is good, it's not the best I've had but its consistently good. no complaints.  The spring rolls are fresh, but they are small. A lot smaller than any other place I've been.  Some of the entrees I've had we're just mediocre including Kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, curry chicken, and walnut shrimp. They weren't bad, just nothing stood out.  One dish that did stand out was the Honey garlic pork chops. I don't know if these are Vietnamese or Chinese or what, but they are some of the best food I've had at an asian restaurant. So tasty!  All in all, with the exception of slow service I don't have any major complaints for Pho Kim Long. I'll continue to go there, just usually late night because during the day I feel like there are better options.",

It's like dude you see me choking down the vermicelli least you can do is get that pop I ordered 5 times already...     The food is good and I love the flavor of their charbroiled chicken and it's really not overpriced but the lack of service is something else.

That made me sad.  Can't go wrong with the springs rolls, taste fresh, and they come out quick! The broth of the pho is decent -- I've had better, but this restaurant does the trick for me. The quality of the meat is decent too. The veggies to put in the pho were clean and fresh.  Clean restaurant, friendly and attentive staff, they accept card (don't know if there is a minimum), restrooms are clean. It's located in a strip mall type of place off of Spring Mountain Rd.

They gave us the menu and came back a minute later to take our orders. It would take me at least 5 to decipher their menu.   In addition, one of my friends and I ordered similar pho but with slight differences in meat. One was large and the other was small.  After they brought out our food we started eating. 5 minutes later they came back to say that our bowls were mixed up.  For one thing, there is no noticeable differences between a large bowl and a small bowl. Well no use complaining about that anymore.  The pho quality was somewhat substandard, salty, and lacked effort.  I know its Vegas, but there are many pho restaurants in the area and I've tried one a few blocks down Spring Mountain that actually has tasty well made broth.  This place did not give a lot of meat either.    I can only tell you that I am not coming back here.  It does look clean and all, but you will not be satisfied, just like the many visitors of Vegas who gave this place a try.",

They also gave us wilted basil so I asked for another and they charged me a dollar.

Back then, I really wasn't into pho. Since then, I've been to quite a few places. While I'm still no expert, I obviously know what I like. I've been meaning to return so that I can properly evaluate this restaurant.  Simply put, PKL is A-OK. Their pho satiates the appetite. Their broth is pretty good and the rest of the ingredients complement the soup nicely. Unfortunately, they do not serve tripe, which for me is a bummer. However, they do have that \"home made\" style chili sauce that I strangely prefer over plain old Sriracha. There's nothing wrong with Sriracha of course; I'm just weird like that.  One thing that PKL has going for it is the decor. Places like Pho So 1 make better pho but are completely devoid of any personality. You would never confuse PKL with a diner. That's really not that important to me though.  In the end, it's all about the pho. In that case, PKL is good enough, especially when no other place is open.",

Ok, I will probably have to re-visit this review because when I was here, I was intoxicated and I seriously thought that my food was heavent sent. So, for now, we'll go off my only experience...  Love this place for the fact that it's open late, service is fast, and the food was perfect (for being in my condition, atleast). My girlfriend ordered a beef and broccoli dish which I was eating off her plate - GOOD, I had combination pho of some sort - GOOD. For these reasons, I am def'ly going back. Yes, my food was additionally delicious b/c I had a few drinks in, but friends and family have gone here several times and raved about the food, so, I am sure it would be just as good sober.  FINAL ANSWER: I found my pho place in Las Vegas! Def'ly must come here especially after a night out drinking.",

However, we went for a large portion of the meal without water, because no one took the time to come back to our table and get us water, even after we had two people show up later and get their food ordered. The icing on the cake was when we finally tried to pay our bill. We ate as a large group, so we asked to get our bill separated. The waiter told us, very rudely, that we couldn't split the check. We paid and we got the hell out of there.   The TL;DR version: food is good, service is terrible, probably never going again. For me, the lack of service took away two stars, because this food was damn delicious.",

    "text": "To preface: My review is based only on the pho.  Pho Kim Long is a Las Vegas culinary mystery to me. The restaurant is always busy, which is generally a good sign, and following the masses, I went to sample the pho. I was simply not impressed, and I am not alone, just visit this Yelp discussion: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/topic/las-vegas-ok-gimme-the-best-pho-in-vegas\">yelp.com/topic/las-vegas...</a>  No mention of Pho Kim Long as the best pho, and even the 24-hour convenience does not merit more stars, as Pho So 1 is open until 3am, and after that you should really just be eating Korean BBQ. No need to go to bed on a stomach of noodles; you need protein to repair your party body!  Why didn't the pho impress me? Good question. The pho did not impress me because the broth lacked complexity. My favorite thing about pho is the deep sweet but savory flavor of a good broth-- the magic of anise, cloves and beefy bits-- but at Kim Long, the broth had the taste of a glorified, salty chicken broth. Without the broth, you might as well get the chicken noodle soup at Marie Callender's.  I think that Pho Kim Long gets overrated by hungry, sometimes drunkish visitors because it is close to the strip. I love visitors, I do, but we should try to get you some different late night dining options.",

I opted for a rice plate since I wasn't in the mood for Pho while is 100 outside. The grilled pork, pork skin, and egg dish hit the spot. Nothing fancy, just down to earth good viet eats. It wasn't the best ive had since i'm spoiled with good viet food at home but it sure hit the spot.  The service was attentive and the place was clean.

The convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  I'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although I don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).    Anyway, the food I usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  Squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  I also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  That dish is always on point.  The grilled pork chops is something I used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  Spring rolls you can't really go wrong with and the egg rolls are pretty yum too.  That is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  mongolian beef, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.    One thing I always get here is the pineapple shake!! YUM!  I've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  The pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made with milk and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! I'd def recommend you try it.",

The broth was very flavorful, the spring rolls came out very fast. The wraps were not the freshest but it explains how fast they came out. The servings were big so make sure you have an appetite!

Doesn't care about his customers to top it off 10oz. To be cheap. On top charged my card twice and gave me incorrect cash back. If customers read this at least they will just make the effort to go next door and get better service.

The serving size is good for the price you are paying. I usually get the Pho with beef balls and rare steak (in the soup).

Also a huge portion as well. We ended it with their dessert which was a cup with three different beans and coconut milk(?) I don't remember the name (it had a Vietnamese name), it was delicious!

It can be amusing to spectate once in a while but if you want to find a place for great food and avoid potential creepers, I would try elsewhere ;).   Some of their rice dishes are pretty good once in a while and their calamari is hit or miss. I have friends who always order the calamari... The prices aren't over-the-top, but once again, I am a spoiled New Yorker who's used to the best Vietnamese food being extremely cheap and convenient.   The number one pro of this restaurant is the hours of operation. It's always nice to have an Asian restaurant to chill and eat at during all hours of the night ;)",

We waved our hands around to get the server's attention for a good 30 minutes. They'd avoid making eye contact when we tried to flag them down -_- when they finally took our order, it took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought out.

(we didn't think he'd notice)  Normally, I don't leave the Casinos, not even to eat.     = O  But, we were on our way out, so we stopped here. (we obviously lost and were eating cheap...)   = (  I have to say I didn't know what to expect, vietnamese hooters girls, \"would you like spring roll mister?!?\", while playing sleazy porno music...bada bow bow... (my lame try at cheesy porn music), dimly lit with sticky tables. But I figured, yes, I've gotta see this place for myself. (I'm crajee like that) (Korean for crazy)  It is located in an Asian strip mall, packed parking lot, so watch out, if you know what I mean...  ; p  The place is actually pretty decent inside, it has obviously been expanded from it's original layout. Looks like your typical Chinese family style restaurant. Thank goodness there were other kids in the restaurant... there could of been a screeching of disco records as we walked in with our 12 yr old...   As soon as we walked in we were greeted and taken to a table and given menus. I love Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee.... (ask for extra half and half on the side and you can elongate your drink, I always do) The servers are pretty courteous as well as efficient, and the food was decent, the orders did not come out as fast as I would of expected from the given service. This was the only problem. They had  brought my order out wrong and we didn't want to have to wait again for the right dish. So needless to say wasn't too thrilled about that Pho Kim Long wait for the wrong food.    That is why they only get 3 stars from me, besides the place better be \"Pho King\" Amazing to deserve more stars.  That's a good name \"Pho King\", or \"Pho King Good\", hmmmn... (probably been done....Phok)  We are all so Phonny....not. (slapping my own face)  They are OPEN 24 hrs... duh...Vegas.",

I came here with my boyfriend around 9 pm on a Saturday night and we came across a batman sock laying in the floor next to the aquarium where they have the puffer fish by the entrance.   I  told my boyfriend about it he didn't think it was serious so we went ahead to eat. What proceed next was me keeping an eye  to see how long it will take for them to pick it up.  I tried telling the three different people who tried to take our order, but by the time I was going to tell them they had disappear.

This restaurant is located in the Vietnamese area. It is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants we have eaten at.  Our party of 14 was sat down right away.  Service was quick.  Best of all, everyone enjoyed their dishes, ranging from Pho Dac Biet, Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, Pad Thai, fried calamari, Crab Rangoons, Ca Kho To, Com Chien, and Com Tam.  Isn't it amazing how one restaurant can manage to please 14 people, ordering such a variety of dishes?  I had ordered Bun Rieu for myself and was extremely impressed how colorful, flavorful, and rich the broth was.  The rieu and tofu in my bowl of Bun Rieu soup were tender and spot on.  Half way through the bowl, I decided to share my Bun Rieu with my husband and switched to eating his remaining bowl of Pho.  I thought I would be disappointed to eat Pho after having eaten the yummy Bun Rieu, but boy was I wrong.  His Pho was so good too.  I highly recommend this place.  It will be our go to Vietnamese restaurant when we return to Vegas!",

I feel like you have to go off the strip in order to get good authentic Asian food, particularly pho. And you will definitely need your pho fix after a night of drinking! It's definitely one of my favorite hang over meals...I loved the flavor of the soup, and the meat quality wasn't sucky like a lot of other places.  Since we had a group of girls, there were a variety of other dishes that were delicious. Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:  There was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches...  We ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.  The calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top. We probably over ordered here, but at least we got to try a variety of dishes!",

They said they ate a long hair on a Calamari, and ants on the soup when they told to the guy the hair the take the plate and manager gave them attitude too bad they never took pictures. Manager kick them out and told them health department wont close them down and they will make a lot of money anyways even they did took picture of the hair and ants.  I could not believed it because I haven't seen it. Long story short I was placing an order today on the phone as of 7/12/17 12:05am and spoke with an old guy. Told the guy my order there was a language barrier and for some reason this guy yelled at me on the phone saying ONE BY ONE . I did not get what he meant so I responded slowly so he can understand my order i only order 2 but he is giving attitude and hang the phone. Tried calling back 6 times but does not want to answer. I stop calling back because im afraid they might do something to my food like my friend said.  Just a piece of advice to anyone trying to place an order U never know what they put and what they can do on ur food.  Very bad customer service.  I wont take risk if u do be my guest.",

TWENTY MINUTES later our food has finally arrived to our table and as he's setting my Pho down it tilted a bit and spilled my soup on the table, he apologized and i asked for napkins to clean up but he never came back.. this use to be my favorite spot to come and eat but now i'm considering to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "This location has mixed reviews but when you're in need of recovery food after a long weekend in Vegas, any pho place nearby would do.  The restaurant is very large and the workers are attentive and have better customer service than typical Vietnamese restaurants.  I was not used to them checking up on my table - they asked us how our food was, how everything tasted, and if we needed anything else during our meal.   My cousin ordered the shrimp pho but her order came out to be pho tai.  When she informed one of the workers what the problem was, they took it back and then brought out her shrimp pho with a lot of noodles and shrimp lol. There was no problem with the order change, which was unexpected.  I also ordered their Vietnamese iced coffee.  ITS IS STRONG!!! And so so good.  I ordered a small bowl of pho tai, which was the perfect size for me.  There were a lot of noodles and meat but what threw me off was their broth.  I guess they have good days and bad days but it was too oily for me.. You could see all the oil swimming around.  Besides the excessive oil in my broth, it was decent and did the job as recovery food.",

    "text": "I hate that I'm having to put a review on my favorite place I can't even explain how much I love their food here even though there's times where it hasn't been the greatest. Two years ago I used to come here faithfully every day after work and spend over $20 every day by myself that's how much I used to love this place..... But as time went on I stop coming as much due to their service, The employees treat you so disrespectful and sometimes you sit there for 15 or 20 minutes before anybody comes to your table and you gotta make sure you ask for everything the first time because then you won't see them at all. But when you are done and ready to pay they demand a tip when sometimes they don't even deserve a tip......  I now come here occasionally do to the fact that the guy that collects your payment at the register is such an asshole. I now do deliveries and I hate coming here because since I'm not the customer and I'm the person delivering the food I feel like they treat you worse then when you are the actual customer. One time I had the guy at the register snatch the receipt out of my hand so disrespectfully that I had to snatch the receipt back and I told him not to ever snatch anything out of my hand I had never felt so disrespected and his response was definitely uncalled for. So today I happen to have a delivery there again and once I walked in the door and I realized it was him I honestly just wanted to cancel the order to avoid dealing with him but I said fuck it maybe today he will be in a good mood but nope, So I finally asked him today, What was his name he states his name is Jason I also asked him are you the owner and he states he is. Ooooh and before he process my transaction there with a guy before me and I realize that I wasn't the only one that got that kind of treatment he literally threw the credit card back at the guy and then when the guy just grabbed his card and just walked away he started laughing....... So at this point I tell him that he is the most disrespectful person I have ever met and that he is super rude and he roles his eyes and says not one word. It's crazy that an owner or he states he's the owner((Jason)) would even treat his customers like that. You would want customers to come back, And this guy has been there for years as long as I've been going there I have seen him there and it seems like he just hates his job so fucking much and if that was the case why would he hire somebody else to do the job for him because obviously he hates being there or at the register. Honestly like I had mentioned in the beginning I hate having to put a review on them but I'm tired of every time I go in there I literally get treated like shit and it's hard because I love their food but then I hate their service it's like damn I work as hard as they do and I don't ever treat my customers the way they treat me they need a lot of cleanup to do with their customer service skills because it is beyond the word horrible. If you are out wanting to enjoy yourself on your day off ect..... I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here because the way they treat you here will definitely get under your skin.",

We were seated within 10 minutes of our arrival. Our food came out fairly quickly after we ordered. The salt and pepper calamari and pork chop was a little on the greasy side but still very good. My parents ordered the plain porridge and it was exactly what they were craving. I recommend to add a little bit of soy sauce for some extra salt (it was a little bland without it). What stood out the most in this meal was how perfectly cooked and well seasoned all of the veggie dishes were. I highly recommend this restaurant when in the area. The wait staff is kind and diligent and give very good recommendations.",

I went back here for lunch, and the broth is by far my favorite for pho in Vegas. My faith was in viet noodle bar when they first opened, but they've gone downhill for me over the past year.

I've never heard of this order wait period unless someone can confirm it for me.  The food overall is great and comes in on time.",

This place is really nice for a pho restaurant.  Decor is clean and modern.  The food is good too.  Broth comes out nice and hot too.  Must give props to their extra attentive and friendly service.  I ordered pho tai bo vien with steak on the side.  They inadvertently forgot to give me steak on the side.  I actually didn't even say anything and the manager brought out a plate of steak as well as a hot bowl of broth for me.  Very considerate.  A must visit for those visiting Vegas looking for a remedy for their hangovers.  Avoid primetime lunch on weekends -- wait tends to be a little longer.",

    "text": "I am always weary when it comes to going to Vietnamese restaurants. I am also kind of hesitant when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants that serve Chinese food. With that being my family's background, it is hard to eat at some places and not say that one of my parents could make it better.  It has been forever since I went to a restaurant with the intention of getting pho. I came here with a group of friends to celebrate one of them getting a promotion. None of us ordered from the Vietnamese menu. It is probably for the best, because I am unforgiving most of the time.   Instead we got items off of the Chinese menu and did it family style. The eggrolls and crab rangoons are nothing special. I would rather skip the appetizers and just order more entree dishes. The Pepper Beef is generous and comes with a beautiful array of broccoli. Mongolian Beef was tender and had a decent flavor to it, but it lacked the kick. Kung Pao Chicken had me searching out for the hot peppers to make up for the previous dish. The Singapore Noodles came in a mountain sized portion and had a subtle curry flavor to it. The stand out dish was the Honey Garlic Porkchops. They are phenomenal. Large pieces of boneless and bone in meat fried crisp, tossed in a lightly sweet sauce, and topped with fried chopped garlic. I was grabbing piece after piece.  Not only is Pho Kim Long a place to sooth your hangover. It is a place to get it started. With a decent selection of mainly imported Asian beers and a few common domestics, you can begin the party. Add in some cold sake to do sake bombs and you have a party. With 2 apps, five entrees, and three rounds of drinks we paid $120. It is a deal.",

But in Pho Kim Long's case, it's the best place to get pho at 8 in the morning after having a group of guys crash your suite and force you to take shots at 7a.m. and refuse to let you go back to sleep.  I bad the Bun Bo Hue which I never had before. It came with beef and pork feet, but since I don't eat pork feet I gave it away. I heard it came with blood and intestine as well, but  I am very thankful that they did not include it in my dish! I've had better eggrolls and better spring rolls, but when you are hungry at 8am, food is food!  The prices are very decent here. The food came out fast, the service was fast and the servers were friendly. I would come to this place again if I ever wanted pho/vietnamese food  in Vegas.",

I said to them in a polite way, \" I'm sorry, but this is our table because we have a party of 11. I really am sorry.\" They understood and walked to talk to the waitress that pointed them there. The waitress came back to me and said, \" is there a problem?\" In the most bitchiest way possible. I said, \"this is our table and you decided to place that family here.\" She said,\" is your party here?\" I said, \"no, but your waiter sat us down and told us we can save it.\" She said, \"no you can't do that. Go back to the waiting area.\" I just followed because it is Christmas and because we should just cut the crap. After 5 minutes, they sat us down and said, \"next time, make sure all your people are here.\" Pretty much there isn't gonna be a next time. We basically switched tables 3 times. Because they also said, \"the big table is open. You guys should switch.\" So we did.  But this waiter, that told us to switch the 3rd time, apologized for the inconvenience of the switches and her coworker.  On to the food, they forgot to put in my order. I'm used to it because for some reason, at most restaurants, they forget my order. It's alright. The food in general, was alright. Everything was alright.

It is a great idea for vegas, but not for a consistent flavor of pho soup.   The service is ok like any other pho place. The server would come to our table when we just sat down and wait until we decide.   The pho does not have a clear sweet broth with a full load of complex spiced flavor. There was a cloudiness to the soup. The bo vien (meatball) has a consistency of an Italian meatball but it has no flavor at  all. Usually the bo vien has a bounciness when I bite into it. The brisket and rare flank tasted fine.   The vermicelli w/ grilled pork and egg roll was not the best I've tasted. However if I was craving for this after all the buffet I went to, this will do.        --The grilled pork is lean and nicely charred, but not too mind-blowing of a flavor.         It's missing the sweet crusted part of the pork. The egg       --The egg roll were nice and crispy. The stuffing inside was smushy. I couldn't         the meat, veggies, or vermicelli.",

One of the fish dish seemed undercooked.  I've been here years ago and it was never this bad.   Yes, They are busy , but I guess they are happy with the customer traffic that they start to neglect in quality of the food and service.   Great, we are just finished and the waiter walked by and asked, \"Finished?\" With the most grunt tone...we said, \"yes\" and he started clearing out table as if we're in the way of the incoming customers.   I hate going to places when they treat their own kind like crap.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for the long Thanksgiving weekend, and after being outside in the cold all day long, we needed some Pho to warm us up. This place was recommended by a fellow parent that was there for the same tournament as us, so a bunch of us went.  That was actually my first time ordering a bowl of Pho for myself. I usually just order rice and some other meat. My husband is the Pho lover and eats it on a weekly basis.  My bowl of Pho was really good and for that bowl alone, I'd give 5 stars. My husband of course enjoyed his and so did everyone else in our group.  The low stars are because the service was just terrible. To be fair, we were a large group, however, we did split up into 3 separate groups to make it easier on the staff. Or so we thought.  Food came out sporadically and we were ignored by the staff. One guy dropped off two bowls and walked away, and when we were trying to tell him it wasn't ours, he ignored us and continued to walk away. We had to stop another waiter and let him know it was someone else's food.  As our food was coming out (sporadically) the same rude guy would stand so close to me that he almost hit the side of my head with a plate. And later, as we were eating, he reaches right between my husband and me to fill up the spoons that are in the middle of the table! Could he not wait? Or could he not ask us to hand the thing over? And as he was passing through behind our table, I heard him say \"behind you, move out of the way\" to a customer! He was horrible and seemed miserable to be there.  Would I go back? Probably not, there are many good Pho places out there. But I did enjoy my Pho.",

The wait time has been about 20 minutes each time I've gone. You can get pho to go which is awesome, and they definitely don't skimp on the amount they give you--I almost never finish it all. I go back and forth between the 14 (rare beef pho) and 15 (rare beef and brisket). Both are amazing. Great flavor and is consistently good. I read some reviews saying the calamari wasn't good, but I have to disagree. I think it's great. A little greasy, but great flavor. I love the seasoning they use on top. I will continue to come here when I visit, and would recommend it to friends. It is Pho Kim awesome.",

    "text": "I ate here with a family friend and her mother to celebrate her mom's birthday.   Ugh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves.   I already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas.   We waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here.   It wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were \"improperly aged,\" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review.   The pork chop that my \"aunt\" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over.   To add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant.   The service was cordial but average.   All of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and/or cut costs.",

I've passed by this location a few times, and always wondered why the interior/workers were very formal - then I found out it was to perhaps make up for the lack of good food.  Ordered the meatball pho, portion was pretty small. The weather here is FREEZING, and a nice hot bowl of pho is usually the cure!  But this bowl was lukewarm. The meatballs tasted rubbery and artificial. I left",

Another good sign, there were mostly Vietnamese patrons in the place. But the pho ga (chicken soup) and the bun bo hue (spicy Hue style soup) were barely par. Check that. The bun bo hue was not good, sour, tart, not fresh, and the noodles were over-cooked. The young man serving seemed mute, at first, because all he did was nod or point at the menu items. Service was slow too. Unless it's a hangover emergency, pass on this place until they get back to making good food.",

We stayed at the Rio this time so this place was literally down the street. Decided we wanted to try this place out cause we didn't want to pay $20 for buffet at the casino. This place is pretty good. I ordered a bowl of pho dac biet which was like almost $8 and my hubby ordered the vermicelli with egg rolls and charbroiled beef for around $8. Our meal combined was less than $20.  Later that night my friend wanted pho so I came back with her and this time I ordered the vermicelli with egg roll and charbroiled beef and she ordered the pho. It was equally yummy. I like how they have so much choices of pho, rice plates, vermicelli, etc.    A lot of people come here so this place does get packed. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll most likely come back here cause their food is so yummy. I like how it's open really late so you can go anytime like after clubbing. Pho is a good hangover remedy :)",

    "text": "If the food does not make you sick, the customer service will!  This place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but I'm going to round up for these guys.  The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.  I visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.  We were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?  We finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.    The food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.    In the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?  I personally would rather go to a place that FAILS less.",

    "text": "The service is disappointing. This is my second time here. Eventhough I've had better Pho, I'm a creature of habit when I'm needing comfort food. Pho Kim Long is open 24/7, and both times I've dined after 1am. They were very busy both times. The Salt and Pepper Calamari was a suggestion from my waiter. It was the bomb! I decided to try the Pan Fried Cake with pork and shrimp. It comes with a heaping bowl of lettuce and fish sauce. I didn't know what to do with the lettuce. The bus boy was helpful and very friendly. We were never asked what we wanted to drink. At least we were given water. I had to call the waiter over to order a drink half way through the calamari. I ordered coconut juice which came in the coconut. I didn't have time to enjoy the generous portions of calamari and pan cake. The waiter rushed the two bowls of Pho (noodle soup) and condiments to our table. I wanted to order a dessert but the waiter dropped the check and ran off. We were seated for barely 20 minutes and were being rushed. When he came back to the table I was going to ask for dessert but he didn't give me a chance. He said abruptly, \"Sorry, please pay.\" RUDE He stood there as I dug my credit card from my purse. I felt uncomfortable. My friend asked for boxes for the food uneaten. on our way out the door I heard our waiter rushing another table of 6 people. He mentioned something about a shift change. Then it clicked. Was he more concerned with the tip? WTH? Unlike my soft spoken self, someone at that table didn't take kindly to being rushed. With other Pho restaurants open late to choose from, I think I'll try the other late night Pho restaurants from now on. This place is just not special enough to deal with an unpleasant experience.",

The place is clean and seems up to standard with their health codes, the waitresses are nice, quick and friendly towards you which makes the restaurant feel more comforting! Thank you Pho Kim Long!

Everything was delivered quickly and the entire wait staff was attentive, my wife skipped the rice with her meal and I think every waiter noticed that she didn't have rice stopping by our table offering to get some for her.  I have had similar dishes at other Vietnamese restaurants and while the food was good, the food here at Pho Kim Long was exceptional in comparison.",

We're not from Las Vegas and when we feel like Vietnamese food, we go here so we thought we would do the same thing this time.  Big mistake and a waste of money! First off, the wait was an hour long which is not a problem but the young lady in charge of this process was overwhelmed and doesn't seem to have this organized.  While she seats people, new customers walking in the door were just grabbing the sign-in sheet on their own and writing their name on it, absolutely no organized fashion.  People were on top of each other. Next, food took some time to get out.  Second, we didn't get refill on our water.  Third, when we got the bill, they charged us for steamed rice ($6!) on dishes that should come with rice. Why would you charge extra on rice if the dishes come with rice??  They were nickel and dime-ing on everything.  Fourth, when we gave our credit card to pay the bill, the waiter asked us, \"how much tip should I add on here?\"  What??  Who does that??  Shouldn't tips be optional and up to the customer on how much they want to add..AT THEIR DISCRETION???  So feeling cornered, we said 15% is fine.  When we got the credit card receipt back to sign, the waiter rounded up the 15% into whole dollar...HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO WRITE IN THE TIP, rounding up!  The worse service ever and I feel like they want to charge you for every little thing possible to make money.  Needless to say, we're not coming back.  If there was zero star, I would put that.",

And then when I told the server that I didn't like it, he did take it back but the other waitresses really rude about it.. Busting out loudly saying what is wrong with the calamari that me and my guest heard it from across the room..  Not very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off..   However my friends chicken wings are pretty alright.. Then our food came my file is really good I ate the whole thing..

The person behind the counter demanded a 15 percent tip up front.  My uncle told him that he will be leaving the tip at the table.  The guy told him no and demanded it before he payed the bill.  No where did I see a sign of mandatory tip yet they felt like it was a given.  The people in front of us was also given the same treatment.  I don't shy away from tip,. Would give 20+ percent if I felt like the server deserved it.  This shady under handing tactics made it seem like someone is trying to pocket it without sharing with the server.",

Also food has gone to shit as well. Maybe a notch down from mediocre. WE WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INSIDE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. Shame on you foe Kim long. I also work in food industry and I will NEVER RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT and forever talk bad about this place.",

There was a server I wasn't able to catch the name of who took my table's order and when I asked her to repeat it back, she gave me this \"Giiiirl, I got it\" look and recited it back, \"Easy.\" She was sassy and I liked her.  I ordered the rice with pork chop and cha trung (steamed egg meatloaf) along with a small bowl of soup. It was delicious! The pork chop was one of the better ones I've tried from a Vietnamese restaurant. I also ordered a thai tea with boba. I'm really picky when it comes to boba, and unfortunately the boba here wasn't that great, hence 4 stars instead of 5. The thai tea itself was decent.   I would eat here again the next time I was in Vegas.",

My plan was to get some pho, but I ended up getting something else. I can't even remember the name of it, but it had noodles, salad greens, small egg rolls, and shrimp in it. It was okay, not fantastic- but a lot of sauce helped add some flavor. The service was pretty speedy, and the prices reasonable. The portion was pretty large as well.  Decent food for soaking up the alcohol, and available whenever the mood strikes you!",

Vegan pho, count me in!  Arrived around 2AM.. had to wait about an hourish as the line was really long so probably got seated around 3AM. Kinda sucked with our seating as we unfortunately were in swimsuits and we got the table RIIIIGHT smack in the middle, perfect for viewing for the people waiting in the waiting area, and right in front of the kitchen/register area. Fantastic.  So, while me and my girls tried our best to avoid eye contact with anyone other than ourselves, we ordered some warm, scrumptious pho for all of us plus some dishes to go for later.   All in all, I'm totally a fan of the place, considering if one comes to vegas and is staying in a hotel on the strip, goodluck on finding that recovery soup the next morning. Ubering was def no problem at all, lookin at maybe $7 bucks to and from depending on the time you go.   ANYWAY, food was good, service was good, expect a line, will be back again.",

This place is always packed with drunken guests or tourists looking for a quick lunch after their Vegas trip (which defines the exact two moments I came here, after the club and on the way home) it's off the strip in Vegas' little china town and the pho is pretty on point.   The broth is good, I don't like super sweet pho broth, and it had a nice savory taste. They didn't give a lot of noodles, but it didn't really matter to me, I go for the soup. Warm soup after cold nights  and drunken clubbing? It hits the spot. I always get my beef on the side so that I can cook it myself in the soup, if you love pho tai, you should definitely try it this way! The meat stays nice and tender instead of getting overcooked. I tried it one day on the side and one day the normal way and surprisingly it wasn't super dry like most places, the meat was still pretty soft!   If you have a large party, chances are you will get split up, the most they usually seat is a party of 7-8. And prepare for a wait because this place is crackin'.",

Their service could be a little better BUT with them being a a 24hr restaurant they're  pretty good. They take your order quickly and if you order pho it's out within 5-10 minutes max within you ordering so that's GREAAAAT! I order a mix of things when I go. Their calamari is bomb esp since I love garlic and they top it off with a generous amount of fried garlic. I'll literally put the leftover seasoning on my rice. Egg rolls are decent but when you're drunk they're really bomb haha. Sometimes I get the combo pho which is pretty good, I feel like some places their broth is too greasy but theirs isn't and it's pretty clear broth which is perfect and how it should be. I will say my favorite dish is their charbroiled porkchops with steamed rice. I always ask for \"no bones\" cause I hate cutting up the meat when the bone is in. SOOO flavorful, I liiiiive for the shallots/green onions that they put on top cause it seriously compliments the meat. You will not need soy sauce for your rice (talking to the people who put soy sauce on EVERYTHING) since the pork chops are really well seasoned. Great place for lunch, dinner, breakfast whatever! It's 24hrs so get your Vietnamese food fix on anytime - Welcome to Vegas",

We ordered:  4 orders of Congee with preserved egg & pork $9.95: watery congee, kinda salty with shredded pieces of pork meat & small pieces of egg, not the best I've had because the congee was too liquidy!  5 orders of Chinese fried donut $2.95 - they cut up the donut into bite size pieces, perfect to dip into the congee  2 orders of Combination Pho - husband & father in law ordered this, they said it was good  1 order of Yangzhou fried rice - we all shared this dish, it was ok. Nice to see shrimp in there, good if you add some chili garlic paste sauce..  Overall glad we could dine here at 7:30 am in the morning & walk away full",

I've been here twice now; once being at 6am with absolutely no one in the restaurant and another time being during the lunch rush, on a Friday, on a holiday. Both times were at two extremes, but I know for certain that this place does get really packed during peak times. The restaurant is so big, so the wait time isn't nearly as bad as it feels with so many people around. The most recent time I was here, we counted a total of 25 parties ahead of our name, but our party of 7 got seated within 45 minutes, so all in all, pretty reasonable. We unfortunately got stuck sitting in the back room which seems like an extension of the restaurant with what looks to be like an old kitchen counter in the back. Not an ideal seating arrangement, but it was spacious so it worked.  Our table got an order of eggrolls, which tasted pretty much like your average Vietnamese eggrolls. I ordered the #15 Pho Tai Chin, which was rare steak and brisket and was amazing. Perfect size portion and the broth was so soothing for the cold day. There is plenty of meat and noodles in the bowl and the whole thing was the perfect temperature and full of flavor. Highly recommend!",

In my particular visit today, we had a party of 5 and waited for over 35 minutes. We decided to add our name to the list again as they skipped us by over 10 parties (each with 2-3). We were waiting patiently because we knew we had to wait for a round table. Anyways, the girl ended up calling our second name we put down instead of the first, after which I told her what had happened. Her demeanor totally changed because she knew she messed up.   Anyways, food is pretty consistent to me. It's good, but nothing life-changing. I usually get #15 which is pho with rare steak and brisket. I do also like the fried tofu.",

The vermicelli, meat, and condiments were all good.   It is a little more pricey here but the service is great and the place is large, nicely decorated, and very clean.

This is only second time we have eaten here. We won't be returning here again.  It was like the \"hood\" in the restaurant. All sorts of people here late at night. After the meal, I have come to realization. They don't want you to get robbed in parking lot, because they want to rob you inside.  We saw some body ordered Hainan chicken last time we were here, so we asked the waiter about this off the menu item. \"Yeah, we have it, do you want steamed rice or Haina rice?\" Of course, we want Hainan style rice, they should not even have asked. That was stupid! Hainan chicken with rice. Very basic!!  It turn out they want you to say \"yes\" so they can charge $1.50 for this little bowl of microwaved-and-overly-nuked-dry-lump-tasteless rice.   They sell half roasted chicken or steamed chicken for $11 on the menu. But if you ordered Hainan chicken, you get a small plate(almost a quarter of chicken) of tough and tasteless chicken for $11 also. Not including rice!!  Service was nonexistent. We asked for hot tea, and never got them. I mentioned it when I was paying and got two words, \"She forgot.\" and no apology.   If you go, expect getting robbed in or out, and go home with half empty stomach.",

    "text": "Wow, things change really quickly over in Chinatown.   1st time I came here, I had such a good time that I gave this place a 5-star review. After my last 2 visits..Now, I gotta give it only 2 stars.   The staff was rude this time around. Very anti-social and easily irritated.  The staff was constantly making fun of customers behind their backs. Calling them all types of degrading names and making fun of their hair, clothes, etc. I found their behavior to be very out-of-line.   Food was still really good. So they get 1 more star.   I don't understand why this place attracts such a shady crowd?  People all around me were loudly talking about sexual topics, drugs, and screaming profanity in the air.   I really don't mind that atmosphere because I use a lot of profanity myself, but this place is designed like one of those fancy 5-star restaurants, so I would expect a more upscale crowd.  Infact, I enjoy that kind of atmosphere when I am at a  dive-place like \"Ellis Island\" or downtown, but \"Pho Kim Long\" is a fine-dining establishment with it's giant neon fish tanks, marble tables, and chandeliers. I know I am in my 20s, but I have a lot of friends who are 60+, and one of my friends is actually a former civil rights activist from the 1960s. I felt really  bad having a man of his integrity have to sit there and listen to drunks and typical vegas-trash talk so much sh!t around him.    This sucks because now I gotta find another 24 hour Pho place. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.",

I should have noticed the red flag when my food came out a mere 2 minutes after ordering but I just ate as normal. It wasn't until after I had eaten that I noticed half of a straw wrapper in my soup. It wasn't mine as I thought at first. When the mgmt was notified they told me it was my own until I showed my wrapper was in one piece unlike the half of one in the soup.

Brought some out of town friends here on Monday (Labor Day) around 1pm.  People were everywhere inside and outside waiting.  I almost gave up immediately but my inner gut & the \"best of RJ's\" on the windows made me stay.  When we finally made our way to the front to put our name in we asked the guy how long the wait was.  His reply, \"really fast\".  I couldn't help but chuckle but who are we to argue. LOL  Surprisingly, our wait wasn't too long before our name was called.  With all the people everywhere I was halfway expecting to be waiting a while.  We were seated by a window.  Literally every table full.  A guy came to take our drink order.  While we checked out the menu every meal was numbered making it easy to order.  Each item had a detailed description underneath for white girls like me or at least I'd like to think. haha  BTW the menu is gigantic.  I'm often overwhelmed by such menus but I knew what I was looking for.  My BF and I decided we would share each of our orders so we could try a couple different dishes.  We had settled on two things to share until I heard my friend say...UDON Noodle!  I just discovered Udon Noodles when I was in Cali. I honestly cannot have enough of it.  To describe it to someone I would say its like a really thick soft spaghetti noodle.  Here is what we ordered:  *Beef Udon Noodle - I thought it was fantastic.  The BF thought it was a little peppery (you could actually see the black pepper in it) but it was still our favorite. *Chicken Pho - A little bland broth flavor (I remember it being better), chunks of chicken, thin rice noodles.  We added a bunch of hot sauce to spice it up and give it a little more flavor. Pretty good even though it felt like it was the hottest/humid day of the summer.  We did only eat half the soup.  The bowl was as big as my head. *Our friends also got the Beef Udon and love it.  They also got the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice and it was a huge portion.  She only had half of it.  We waited a bit for the check.  The servers were running around like crazy but she eventually came.  Our bill came to around $70 I believe-our friends had bought.  Overall it was good.  Just super crazy busy.  This is definitely a popular spot.  The reviews say that its opened 24 hours.  I cant imagine really wanting a drunken night soup bowl at 3am but it sounds like a lot of people do.  (I secretly opt for a drunken night Fat Burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  Its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours.",

The service here is so rude that it just ruins the meal for you. Also the tables who were sat after us received their food and water way after us. Pho Kim Long is so dysfunctional, unorganized, and has one of the work customer service I have ever received. I'm sure there are other pho places in Vegas that are way better than this.",

The Pho here is pretty darn close to what I had in Vietnam, I mean it is just broth, noodles, and beef... but here you can tell their broth sits in kettles like they do at Pho 999s in HCMC. They don't give you as much beef as they do in viet nam, but it's still really really good. Can't say much for service, but food A+.   Here at Pho Kim Long (^,^ he he he) it's almost a mixture of Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai with their dishes which makes it better than just a Pho house.   Another plus is they're open 24 hours, which is probably why they're broth is so good.  So if you got a hankerin for some soup that's not heavy, but will fill your belly, come here to Pho Kim Long II and enjoy a bowl of Pho, hot and sour or wonton soup.",

Thank goodness we didn't wait longer than 20 minutes and as soon as we ordered our food appeared magically fast.  Perfect hangover cure with your delicious broth and flawlessly cooked noodles.  The broth is full of flavor- hot, salty, yet sweet from all the onions & cilantro in the soup. Even best is that the rare beef isn't chewy but tender and I'm able to actually eat it without feeling like it's going to choke me on the way down.  Trust me, a lot of Vietnamese Pho places rare beef is so chewy you can't eat it.    I just got back from LV and I am already in need of pho from here.  Pho Kim Long has one of the most flavorful pho's I have ever had.    BTW...what's with these names at these Vietnamese restaurants?  Pho King Funny!  Pun intented.",

    "text": "Wanted to write an updated review because they did something that was weird during my last visit.   Food order this time around:  Calamari - Fried really well, but needed more salt/seasoning.  Vermicelli - Meat was really flavorful and they gave a amount of meat. Pho - Pho with meatballs.. meatballs still the same as my last review, just falls apart.    So when the time came to pay, the waiter came with the bill and my boyfriend gave his credit card, but instead of taking the card and ringing him up as usual, the waiter kept asking which tip option my boyfriend would like to put (15%, 20%, 25%, etc) and did not leave until he circled something. HE WAS LITERALLY HOVERING OVER US and pressuring us to give him a dollar amount or choose one of the pre-calculated amounts. When we received the receipt to sign, the tip was already charged but there was still a tip line to fill out? What's the point of asking us how much tip we want to give if we can still write down what we would like to give. Also, I've heard about a lot of restaurants doing this, but basically they calculate their suggested tips against the total bill with tax (should be on subtotal), and usually I don't really care/pay attention but since they were so adamant to get our tip amount before even ringing us up I decided to calculate AND YUP the tip was calculated after taxes. We ended up paying like 25% tip (which really I don't mind if the service was exceptional, but it wasn't). I can't say I won't be back (cause it's pho kim long in vegas!!), but I'll definitely pay more attention.",

    "text": "Came here due to the reviews and was very disappointed. After reading through the reviews to figure out what to get I ordered the large \"rare beef\" pho based on comments in Google. I will say that my bowl of pho was tiny and the beef was not rare - my beef was so cooked it was gray -I have attached photos, and broth below par. I'm from Houston,home to a lot of Vietnamese people. The soup base was not inspiring at all- I never seen a large pho also be so small. It was smaller than the small I get in Houston. If you end up here and order this you will wonder if you ordered a large pho- because I seriously wondered that.   Also I ordered \"salt and pepper calamari\". Now one would think ordering \"salt and pepper\" calamari would include the titles ingredients. I must have been crazy, but there was no \"salt or pepper\" on my calamari and they delivered it to my table with some marinara. Yes, marinara - I kid you not. I told the first person there was no salt and pepper on my salt and pepper calamari. Nothing, then my waiter came after another 10-15 minutes and I told him that I advised the person that delivered my pho there was no salt and pepper on it. How does the kitchen send out \"salt and pepper\" dishes without salt and pepper? My waiter looked at me and then at the dish and said -\"there's no salt and pepper\". Yes- I know because I've been staring at it for 20-25minutes. They took it off and offered to redo it-surely terrified the may return with salt less or pepper less next, I asked for spring rolls- but sadly these were the worst spring rolls and peanut sauce I've ever had. This was a disappointing visit considering they hype in the previous reviews. Want some real Vietnamese? Come down to Houston honey. Don't waste a trip here as this place easily fell into my top ten worst dining experiences for me. Thank God I had a rent a car, if you paid for a taxi here you'd slap yourself.",

I always think that is nice to see that the employees here puts in efforts for little things like that .   The pho here is not bad. I really like their broth bc it's flavorful. The noodles were cooked to perfection and just the right texture. The only thing that I wasn't used to was the meat as it's much different from the textures of meat in the pho that I'm used to in the Bay Area.",

We requested them to heat them us and server said that's how they served!  Excuse me? I eat pho all the time, the temperature was like u left a hot soup and sat there for at least twenty min.

    "text": "True to its name, the wait is \"pho-kim-long\" and the service is just terrible.  I came in and put my name down on their waitlist for a party of 1, then stepped to the side and wait.  There were plenty of free tables around 6pm so I should be seated right away, right?  NOPE.  The servers there completely ignored my existence, didn't even bother looking at the waitlist, and then when a larger party came in, some server just walked by and asked them how many people, grabbed some menus and seated them right away.  At that point I started to get annoyed, so I asked another server, who was rushing by, for a table for one.  He was like yeah ok someone will help me soon.  Ok, so I continued to wait; another 5 mins went by with no one paying attention to me.  Then, another huge party of 8-10 people walked in and the same server who previously seated the other party instead of me came back and was about to give them a table as well.  So I had to step in between them and loudly said, \"Uh excuse me, I was here first?? My name is on the waitlist??\"  The server finally pointed me to a table and told me that I could sit down.  What's the point of having a waitlist and yet not bother checking people in in the order that they came in??  So I finally sat down feeling annoyed.  Took another while for someone to finally stop by and take my order.  Thankfully the wait for the food wasn't that long, but the food was mediocre at best.  I ordered the Pho Combo and it only came with less than 5 pieces of meat, like really?  On top of that, no one came by to refill my water either.  When I was done, I asked for a check and had to wait yet another 10 mins and still no one brought me the check.  I got up and went straight to the cashier, and not surprisingly, the cashier was chatting with someone for another good 5 mins, knowing that I was standing there waiting to pay.    I don't understand how this place got high reviews.  Maybe larger parties get more attention than singles?  Regardless, even if I came in alone or with other people, I was still a paying customer who deserved to be treated as such.  Never coming back here again and will not recommend this place to anyone.",

This is my story.  My order today is the reason for this not-so-good review. Not only did I not receive the fish sauce I requested for my spring rolls, but my calamari was so carelessly and poorly prepared I didn't even eat it. There were chunks of nearly-whole squid in the mix.  If a chef is moving too quickly to notice there are whole chunks of calamari being fried, what else is he not noticing?  The quality of the meat in my pho tai also left much to be desired, as the finely sliced, succulent meat I once knew has been replaced with thick slabs of tough, fatty, budget cut ass meat similar to what you would expect to find chopped up in a Philly cheese steak.  I couldn't even chew this meat! It was like chewing on leather shoelaces.  The spring rolls were also terrible, but they always are, so I'm not complaining about that.  It's clear that there has been a serious decline in both the quality control and professionalism of this establishment. Bad show, Pho Kim Long, bad show.",

I usually say that nothing good ever happens after 3 am, but I am wrong--Pho Kim Long is the best decision you will make after 3 am!",

Apparently there has been several management changes.   That said, the pho is pretty good and full flavor.     I recommend you visit during the normal meal hours and avoid the late night hours for better service.",

I'm sure the food is ok but not worth the poor service.  Should have read the Yelp reviews first. Went down the street a block and found a better location with solid food.",

This time I ordered hu tiu kho thap cam. It tasted nothing like what it should be. Food came out not as warm/ hot. Noodles were a bit undercooked. The seasoning/ sauce that they used was just simply sweet, like a sweet, diluted soy sauce. Some of the squid were still see through, aka raw. I'm not sure if that's how it should be, so I didn't touch it. Chicken in there was just simply pieces of boiled chicken breasts, without any seasoning. It feels like everything was boiled separately, then put together, with sweet soy sauce over it. I was so disappointed. I fed my son just the noodles and the broth that it came with.",

Details:  Wednesday at 1:15pm  We were in and out in 30 minutes ... and we took our time, too   The restaurant was packed and the wait was still less than 10 minutes  Waiter took our order within a couple of minutes of being seated   Egg rolls / Spring rolls were delivered to our table in less than five minutes from ordering -- flavors were light and clean  Iced Coffee with Boba was satisfyingly delicious.   Pho Ga (Chicken) came out within 15 minutes -- Light, no overpowering flavor, chicken was perfectly sized (not just large cuts)  Our waiter stopped by our table to ask if our rolls arrived -- we'd already enjoyed it and the plates were cleared when our meal arrived. That's how fast and efficient the Staff is here!  Our drinks never ran low  It was busy, everything came out super quick and we didn't feel rushed. A very well oiled machine with a mission-oriented Staff  Would ABSOLUTELY come back again!!!!  *Parking: Lots of parking -- packed, but found something right away",

Honestly there are amazing and affordable restaurants off the strip that will satisfy picky eaters.   Pho Kim Long isn't new to me, I have eaten here many times while visiting Vegas so felt it was time for a review.  My family and I decided to have some pho so we met up here.  The pho is decent and this place is open 24/7!! That's one of the best things about this place.   We were quickly seated and our food came out not too long afterward we ordered.  My family was happy with their choices of food and so was I.  I'd rather have pho at 8.99 a bowl than pa 15 bucks for a salad or some fast food on the strip.    Place does get busy at times with all the visitors from out of state.  Clean, and staff is attentive.  Yes we will eat here again on future Vegas trips.",

Then I had the genius idea of getting pho, and my friends agreed, so we trekked out here for to satisfy our cravings.  We were surprised it wasn't more crowded, but we were seated right away. The host guy was really hustling. He was running between the host stand trying to seat everybody and also serve waters. Their menu is impressive and also has a selection of Chinese dishes in addition to the Vietnamese offerings.  I ordered the special combination pho. There was a generous helping of meat, but that's where the good things end. The broth was quite bland. The beef tasted low quality and stringy. At least it somewhat hit the spot for us.  Service was pretty good. The host was super nice, and the waitstaff was pleasant. The pho is mediocre, but if I were more of a Vegas regular, I'd be back often to try some of the other options on their menu.",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Can't go wrong Viet & Thai. And 24/7 to boot.  Well, the drama told under Sushi Kaya continues as I was, yet again just two nights later, called into DD service by pals after yet another Rhino visit. (This time, they had some purpose, I suppose: Free local entry (always), free fried chicken and sides, plus super-cheap well drinks at 5pm due to Monday night football.)  This time, per my conclusion about Sushi Kaya, I put my foot down and insisted we try someplace off my Chinatown bucket list, that being Pho Kim Long. I heard no objections. In fact one of my riders repeatedly referred to it as \"a legend.\"  Digs were attractive, crowded but not swamped at 10pm. Parking wasn't too much of a squeeze play.  This is a serious venue boasting a robust menu containing a lot of the usual Viet, Thai and Chinese suspects. I am sure if my long-gone Viet lady friend had been here, this place could have busted out anything she conjured in her mind.  They even have bubble tea and bubble thai coffee, it appears. Lord knows I love Thai/Viet coffee so much, but it'll keep me awake for two days. Every place I've ever asked for it in decaf, they've looked insulted, so I've stopped asking.  I enjoy Viet & Thai cuisine, though I don't really understand it very well. So I just went tourist and had the pork drunken noodles. The rest of the table did Seafood Pho (which was, for some reason, off-menu). The server described it as having calamari and other scrumptious ingredients, but that the crab would be 'imitation.' We whetted with Spring Rolls. The peanut sauce was thick and bold.  Service was attentive, we wanted not. My plate had a generous portion. Of course the Pho bowls were huge. Spring rolls were fresh, large and tasty. My table-mates were clearly pleased. Food-wise, I strongly suspect this is a 'can't go wrong' venue.  Prices were more than fair, especially given they apparently have a near-monopoly on 24-hour upscale Viet/Thai quality grub.  There's no catch here. A bona fide dining experience, all-night long.   Well maybe one small caveat. A few of the tables -- including ours -- are just too close together. The people next to us were practically dining along side us ... and they probably didn't enjoy the slurred conversation where my pals were self-evaluating their Rhino expertise. (Why is it that most guys don't realize which sex is running the floor in a strip club?)  CONCLUSION: I could very easily get spoiled to this venue ... it's certainly staying on my 24/7 short list ... but I'll have to learn to select my entrees with somewhat more abandon to enhance the experience.  On Spring Mountain (of course), almost directly across the street from Play It Again Sam's, near one end of a long strip mall.  UPDATE: I returned within a week. I told someone I was heading Chinatown-way for some grub. He said \"try Kim Long.\" So I guess this place IS a legend.  I saw a gaggle of lovely Viet ladies all downing delicious-looking pho. But I feared I would slop some soup on my dapper duds. So I went tourist again with spring rolls and pad Thai pork.   It was perfect.  UPDATE: The pretty young Viet ladies at the nail salon say they don't like this place, citing MSG as their cause for conviction. I suppose if you make your own pho at home, nothing else is going to seem better. To be fair, they did recommend a pho shop over here in Henderson they like. I'll hit it and review it soon enough.",

My friend and I were definitely tired of eating burgers and vegas strip food - we needed soup!  We both got pho and was very disappointed. My friend took the first sip and said \"it's not even hot\". I took a sip right after and noticed the same thing. I have never ate \"warm\" pho before so that was a first. I also didn't want to be \"that person\" to complain and have them fix my order.  I tried to chow down as much as I could but it wasn't great. To seal the deal, my bo vien (meatball) was soggy as opposed to the usual \"chewy texture\" we expect from a meatball. After that I couldn't finish it. This was the first time I have never finished a bowl of pho.  Busy atmosphere and a large # of seating. I'm willing to come back and try other menu items one day though and possibly update my review on yelp.",

It's been pretty cold out, so I wanted something to warm me up. I wish I would've chosen something else. This soup was extremely bland, and I didn't enjoy it at all.   As a side note, the condiment bottles at the table were not clean. They had some sort of film on them, which was a total turn off. The restroom was also extremely dirty.   Probably won't be going back. There are plenty of late night joints in China Town to choose from.",

Their pho is really good as well, and serving sizes are huge. They also have vegan pho which tastes amazing. One caveat I have is that the place is always, always busy. When it's nighttime, regardless of day or time, the place is pack. Be prepared to wait for a table. But it's worth the wait, in my opinion.",

Pho w/egg noodle: 4/5 Don't ask me why but I don't like pho with rice noodle lol So I switch it up. At pho kim long the soup is a bit oily you can definitely see the bubbles floating around. The soup comes hot so be careful, it comes hot for a reason because the thin slices of meat have to cook in the soup. The regular size is more then enough for me so portions are good.  Egg rolls: 2/5  I used to like their egg rolls until they decided to down size. Their egg rolls used to be fat and thick but ever since they changed their recipe they're friend super small and thin. The size of a lumpia basically, and they give you like 1 slice of lettuce. Everyone knows you wrap the egg roll inside the lettuce and dip it in that fish sauce they give you.   Service: 1/5 Even if your belligerently drunk service should still matter. This place is very fast paced and when your drunk you just want things to slow down at that point. The waiters are very pushy and they rush the heck out of you. Once you order and they bring your food out forget trying to get their attention later. Flagging down a waiter there just to get your check is a mission there.",

The Pho is lacking flavor and the beef doesn't seem to be fresh. The Bun Bo Hue is actually tasty and it comes with the chili lemongrass on the side for you to add in the spice level and flavor that you want. The other dish that I like a lot here is the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio! The pork is always well marinated and tender and the noodles and salad are always fresh. Service is always great here.

The wait was rather long for a party of 10 since everyone and their mom is hoping for some pho after a late Saturday night and when you've had too much to drink. The prices are obviously high for what is known especially if you're from the LA area. A regular small bowl of Pho is $7.95 but if you get the Pho Dac Biet it's $8.95. There was a good amount of meat but the broth just seemed like water and oil. Also for some reason each of the Pho broth soups had a different color. Some were more murky than others even though the only difference was the type of beef they had. The service however, is quite good. They refilled our waters appropriately probably because they know most people are hungover and need their best friend aka H20. The interior decor is not too bad but it does look Asian but at least not that old ghetto Asian style. The parking lot can be quite hectic so park carefully so your cars don't get scratched by Asian drivers. Also it's nice that it is near a Lee's Sandwiches because I needed that Ice Coffee for the ride back to LA!",

    "text": "I have been to this place since I was a sophomore in high school (9 years now). I remember the food being so much better than it is now as well as the service. I don't like posting negative things about restaurants but I just want you guys to know what went down before you waste your money for less than mediocre pho. My boyfriend and I went to eat here a couple of weeks ago. It was pretty late, 3 or 4 am. There weren't a lot of people but we still had to wait for like 10-15 min. The service was so bad I was tempted to just walk out. The food was ok at best. Then, the best part happened. This young waiter/cashier started yelling at a customer, getting all up in his face and his girl's face. It was crazy! I don't know what the customer did but I'm pretty sure you're not suppose to threaten them if you work there. After all that, we waited for 20 min for our check without ever getting refills. Then, these 2 Asian girls walked in. They clearly know the waiter guy. They got seated right away with 5 plates of food on their table PLUS the fucking check within 10min. So in conclusion, fuck that place, there's always white castle.",

Now, some places go all crazy town with a million kinds of fake meat, which is really not necessary; but throw a sister a couple of tofu cubes at least! Still, I can't complain too much about a tasty huge bowl of goodness for only a few ducats.  I rounded out my food pyramid with some very tasty tofu nuggets.  Great late night spot (open 24 hrs) and perfect food to soak up the booze.",

Maybe they just bank on the name and good food. Whatever. Maybe I'll get it as takeout next time.",

    "text": "The joys of Pho (pronounced \"ph-uh\") are fairly straightforward.  Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and/or sour sauces).  Simple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).    But all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here's why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.    And Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli (\"bun\" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).  Good enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff's credit, they didn't seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.    I haven't tried it late night, but the place is open 24 hrs so it might be worth a visit after a night out on the strip (put down the Jack in the Box, pick up the chopsticks).",

On a Friday night me and a group of girls decided to come after clubbin at TAO, after dropping the drunkies back off at the hotel we headed to Pho Kim Long! We didn't get here till around 4:30am and to my surprise this place was pretty packed, but they still had a couple of tables open. Parking around this place looked pretty decent.  The pho was pretty good and is always good when you're still drunk or if you have a hangover! The rice plates here are also pretty good! Prices are comparable to that of the prices we have in SF for pho. The service was good, all the waiters were super nice! Overall the pho was good, but I've had better before.  Note: Ask one of the waiters to call a cab for you if you didn't drive here, because you cannot flag down taxis on the street. They will not stop because they can't pick people up off the streets, or you can wait for a taxi to enter the parking lot.",

We both ordered the standard Pho Tai (rice noodles in beef broth) and loved it. The noodles did not clump together like at other restaurants and appeared to be cooked to order. The soup broth was flavorful and very refreshing. I would definitely recommend it. And in Vegas style, the restaurant is open 24 hours!",

It seemed smaller in size than I would find at a typical San Jose pho restaurant, so the price is high, especially if you have a regular bowl (as opposed to the large or dac biet size, which is inexplicably #13 on the menu instead of #1). Even the Thai basil that they hand out is pretty skimpy compared to every decent or good place in California. The rest of my table wasn't too impressed with the food either.  It's unfortunate...

I spent the next 10 minutes picking broccoli, bamboo shoots, and bok choy out of my noodles. There was so much in there that it took up more than half of the plate. Again, I've never had Pad Thai at a Vietnamese restaurant, so I don't know if this is normal, but it was quite annoying. The flavor overall was meh. I probably won't go back.",

I'm by no means a bun bo hue expert but I really enjoyed the subtle lemongrass notes. They give you a different type of rice noodle (not pho noodles).

Cause this most recent trip (though not completely sober yet not completely famished, either) I did not find much enjoyment in their food.  This go around, I had the chicken pho. The chicken was cut up into thin slices of white meat which was a bit chewy. The broth was pretty much a fail with very little flavor. At 8 or 9 bucks for this bowl of noodle soup, I definitely expected better. And since my food was unsatisfying, I took a few bites off of a friend's fried rice. That  was too oily for my taste. I was not feeling that either.  So aside from the very quick service (got our food in about 5 minutes after they took our order), the complimentary hot tea, open 24hrs., and the fact that the name does have a tendency to make people laugh and tell off colored jokes at 3 in the morning, it's just not the local spot for good Asian eats.  If you had the \"best\" of anything here.... you were drunkers, pho sure.",

Definitely 5 stars for cleanliness and promptness in their service for an Asian restaurant. This was probably the most clean Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Decor was modern and restaurant was big - great for big group gatherings or late night munching. They seemed fully staffed so whatever you asked for was done quickly.   Pho Kim Long serves many other dishes, both Vietnamese and Chinese food, so there's a lot to choose from. I ordered Beef Pho and was very satisfied with my selection. The beef slices were very tender! The portion of beef was generous in the size \"small\" bowl. I have to compliment them on their soup - I know every pho restaurant uses MSG but this place seemed to use it sparingly. I wasn't super thirsty after eating and did not have a problem slurping up the soup either =)   This will definitely be my go-to spot if I'm ever back to visit! Come hungry, leave satisfied...especially after a long night of partying =D   Happy Eating yelpers!",

I mean it's not superb either but they take your order when you flag them down, they bring out your food, and they drop off your bill before you ask for it.  This is one of my go to spots in Vegas!  Pho is the best comfort food to heal a hangover.  I usually get the Pho Tai and the small size portion definitely fills me up!  I also really like the deep fried egg rolls.  Soup and fried goods = best hangover cure!  Two thumbs up!",

Especially on the strip, trying to get some good, hot soup on the go is nearly impossible (especially since it was President's weekend) so we went off strip to this Pho restaurant.   When you come in, you know it's a good Pho restaurant when 100% of their clients are Vietnamese and they're all here to eat pho. As we were immediately seated, they took our order of pho and egg rolls. Like any pho restaurant, their food came out almost as soon as we ordered. The pho broth was light and flavorful. Even the GF that was dying said that there was so much different types of flavor going on in the broth. They also gave generous portions of meat in the pho as well. I would say that their meat to noodle ratio was almost 1:1 unlike the other Pho restaurants that I go to in L.A.   The price here isn't that inflated as well. A bowl of Pho ran 7-8$ depending on which one you got and the egg rolls were 6$. The egg rolls weren't anything special but they were skinnier than the ones I usually get.   If you're looking for some good pho (especially after those crazy nights), get off the strip (don't go to the one in TI) and come here. It's cheaper and better quality and bigger portions.",

It's ingredients are multifaceted, and the sweet and sour sauce on top is the only sweet and sour sauce I've ever enjoyed. The pho with brisket is yummy, but I'd like to try the pho at Pho So(which somehow looks better) to compare.  Drunken noodles here are great(any or all meats); so are the potstickers.  I dislike: the spring rolls(they always taste old and bland); the Thai tea here sucks, so get a... Vietnamese coffee instead. Or an avocado smoothie!  Call to make a reservation for a group dinner, or your legs will regret it. Prices are reasonable--some dishes are maybe $2ish overpriced in comparison to nyc/sf spots...

Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.  Service: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. English is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.  Atmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.",

I ordered the combo pho (pho dac biet $~9) and thought the portions were smaller than some other places and the broth was somewhat salty. The saltiness didn't hit me until a couple bites into the meal, but I simply added an extra squeeze of lime to counter the salty flavor.  The price was somewhat reasonable, if you're comparing it to L.A prices. If you're comparing the price to other pho restaurants around the vicinity, it's somewhat expensive.  The interior was well decorated, probably one of the more modern decorated pho places I've been to.  Overall, good experience, but just A-OK on the pho pallet.",

It has earned this distinction with me because they are open 24 hours, they always have a good consistent quality with their food, service is usually fast, and their restaurant is nicely decorated and has a nice ambience. Whenever I try a new Pho place I always end up comparing it back to Pho Kim Long. Most Pho restaurants in Vegas tend to fall short of Pho Kim Long.  I can tell you that after a night of partying or drinking, a big bowl of Pho here really hits the spot. This restaurant is located in Chinatown just a short drive from the strip. Pho is certainly a healthy choice and a great way to keep hydrated out in the desert here. It  will also help warm you up on a cold day. If you have never eaten Pho get the traditional Rare Steak Pho (it starts out rare but is cooked via the hot broth) or get my personal favorite Rare Steak & Brisket Pho. This place seems to be busy all of the time these days with a wait to be seated. Usually the wait is not long and is worth it.",

Then got my combination pho with rice noodles. The broth tasted really good. Just added a little bit of the hoisin and sriracha sauce to give more kick. Service was also fast.   Another plus.

I don't prefer to eat meat so I like that option. I'm allergic to shrimp but still choose to eat their shrimp spring rolls because they're THAT delicious. The pricing is not bad at all and the service is good. Although it's always busy, the wait is never really outrageous. We go every Sunday as our family brunch and it never fails. Try it. ;)",

It was pretty crowded, but we got seated right away.   Ordered a rare steak pho. Delicious as usual. They give A LOT of bean sprouts..I was in heaven! Haha. So generous.   Maybe a bad idea to eat pho the night-of because that's a lot of liquid. Probably will rethink to go the next day instead, haha.  The name of this place still throws me off, haha.",

Food was decent and price was cheap compared to Treasure Island Pho.  Not sure if I would actually go out of my way to come over to Chinatown just to have some pho here.  Service was slow, but the portions were huge.  They gave me so much meat in my pho that I couldn't even finish it .  My friends ordered BBH and it didn't come with pork blood. That was the main ingredient!   I also had the coconut drink , cause I was hungover. $5 for the coconut?! i could have gotten another bowl of noodles.    I will not recommend taking a cab , just to eat this pho. I rather walk over to Treasure Island and pay $15 for the same quality of pho, minus the cab ride.",

It's a dollar or two more expensive then the pho you're used to paying for at home, but it's good. I love all of their rice plates and side dishes too. When I go with groups we always get the greenbeans with minced pork and garlic. Soooo yummy! They're not too far from the strip either, so if you need to cab it, it won't be too expensive.",

The young coconut drink is another benchmark for me, and they serve theirs in  the coconut, so you can scoop out the coconut meat and eat it afterwards.  Haven't had THAT since I was living in the Philippines.  Sure beats the version they serve at my local pho place in the sundae glass with the canned juice/meat.  Expect a short wait, but worth it!",

Well, they really aren't that as they are more of a Vietnamese restaurant with several Cantonese style Chinese dishes. But the food we ordered was pretty good nonetheless. I have been back many times, mostly for lunch and love their barbeque pork with Vietnamese eggrolls and vermicelli (number 23 on the lunch menu). I always ask for extra fish sauce which I really enjoy with this dish. The lettuce and shaved carrots are fresh and crisp, the pork is always done perfectly and the egg rolls are delicious. They add crushed peanuts on the top so beware if you have allergies. I have always found the service to be prompt, attentive and personable even though they are usually very busy at lunch time (particularly on Fridays). I enjoy Pho Kim Long and hope you will as well if you give them a try.",

Frankly, it looked more like a Chinese restaurant rather than a Vietnamese joint inside. And the menu reflected this to a certain extent, where the offering was well beyond what you'd find at a pho place, with dishes that readily reminds you of a Chinese joint in the 626. The waiter / server was helpful, pointing us in the right direction. The pho broth was hot and tasty. Saw a lot of other people eating what looked like stir fried dishes. Definitely going to have to delve into that side of the menu the next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended.",

Especially when they want to charge 8.50 a medium bowl..... The decor has been updated since last yet the service and food is the same.. just pricier.  I have heard that their crab/crayfish night is the fun/tasty however I have yet to experience it.  This review is based on 8 different returns to the restaurant... different times of year, different years.  Yeahhhhhh-- not again.",

This was my go to pho place when i first moves to Vegas over 10 years ago. Since its been a long I thought I would come back and try it again. But things have changed all lot and not for the better. The soup was a decent size cause when I eat pho I love a lot of soup and a large dish. But there was not much meat or noodles in the bowl. Also the soup was not pipping hot at all. This was the first time ever that I didn't drip one drop of sweat eating my pho. It didn't even cook my raw meat all the way...it was still pink! Also ordered the shrimp spring rolls and too my disappointment they were TINY compared to a lot of other places and a little more pricey. Completely disappointing and definitely not going back there again! Save yourself your money and time and go to another pho place instead. Too many places put there. I am so disappointed in my most recent experience here.",

    "text": "I am a Vietnamese from southern california so when it comes to eating PHO, I am not an outsider.  Just about every trip to Vegas, We have made countless  stops here at Pho Kim Long, Not because their food is good( not when a diner compares the quanlity and quantity with a more populous Vietnamese community like Westminster CA, San Jose CA, or Houston TX...Their pho's taste seems ok but the size is like a small bowl in CA and is far away from being on the top notch.  Once in Vegas, when it comes to Vietnamese food, a diner does not have many choices. Even though there are better choices now( in compare with a few years back, thanks to the competition.) But what really gets me to Stand Up:) and create a Yelp account to \"award\" the first so call negative review for Pho Kim Lonng is that I had a bad diarrhea in Vegas and really need a hot bowl of beef congee with green onions and ginger in it to wash down two caplets of loperamide HCL 2mg. So my wife called and ordered two bowls of the beef congee for me and for her too, since we were staying in a hotel room.  Being so exhausted at 3am, I had to drive up there to pick up the food. Ohh my God!!! When I opened it there was literally Almost noooooo meat! ( something My body really need to digest for recovery). When I said Almost it means that there was just a few very tiny pieces floating up and down to the point that I would rather don't see them so my mind can do a better job of persuading the so disappointed stomach that they have forgotten to put the meat in! I have done with my duty as a Yelp reviewer. There are not only Vietnamse diners but also many Americans and others. I wish the best for the consumers' community and hope that as a diner, you will make the best choice for yourself.",

I mean.....usually I don't get beyond the Strip, but I was feeling adventurous and I had major comfort food cravings that Earl's couldn't satisfy. This place proved me wrong!  The wait for 5 the Monday afternoon following EDC weekend was about 20-25 minutes. Not bad considering what a packed weekend it was and the families buzzing around.  Got the Pho Tai Nam with tai on the side. They confused my order. I ordered a small, I got a large. I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.  The smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste.   The decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints. Just don't come in here with high hopes of having a deep conversations -- all the sounds are literally bouncing off the walls. I think it's the \"yay I'm cured from my hangover\" happiness that reverberates through the walls, but the yummy soup could also the case :).",

Quantity is not just what I'm looking for, but you have to make up somewhere when quality is lacking.  Even in a Pho Dac Biet there was no tripe to be found.  How can that be?!  It's a staple.

Right when we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to order FOUR TIMES within a 10 minute time period. Barely having any time to think, the manager asks after his second time, \"Ready to order? There are people waiting to eat so you guys should hurry and make a selection\". (He said something rude along the lines of that). They are basically just trying to get people in, take the money, and kick them out. This is definitely the worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant.   I ordered a #13 combination pho (the combo wasn't really a combo considering there was barely much variety in there) My friend ordered the steak rice plate, which looked slapped on without nice plating presentation. It was not worth the amount paid for the quality.   I don't think I've ever had such a poor experience at a Vietnamese Restaurant. I see some previous complaints about the manager below and it is certain that he hasn't changed at all. What a dick. Please take this evaluation into consideration before going here to eat.",

I love everything about this place!  I always get pho tai and egg rolls. I just love it! There is nothing bad I can say about the food here. The service is usually great but there are times that it is a little slow, but it is never their fault it's usually the customers' fault. Most of the time they are drunk or annoying and it affects the service because the servers are forced to deal with them first so that they can just get them out. It does suck that the workers have to deal with drunk people all the time. Last time I was there there customers were super impatient that they started drumming their chopsticks and yelling. As the server came to refill their water they also ended up accidentally hitting the server in the face and the customer just laughed. You have to give these servers credit because this was just one night, they probably have to deal with that stuff every night.   Overall the food was bomb! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",

The pho was so plain, no aromatics what so ever.   They share parking with a bunch of other places on the strip mall. So parking is horrible. My car door got hit TWICE by someone.   The good part about this place is that your food comes out fast and there's a lot of meat and/or seafood.",

We also ordered spring rolls and crispy calamari as appetizers; wasn't impressed with either of these.

Every time I end up eating until I'm in pain because the flavor is addicting and the portions are so generous! I usually get the Pho Thai soup, it has thin slices of beef and rice noodles. My other favorite dish is the charbroiled pork with spring rolls. The marinade combined with the smokey bbq flavor is killer! Tastes like you got it straight off of your backyard grill.  This place does get crazy busy sometimes so there might be a wait but it usually goes by pretty fast. Put your name down on the list, I promise it's worth it.",

I usually come around lunch time and order a rare steak & brisket noodle soup, sometimes I order an add-on of meatballs for my pho. Appetizers is a must, I always come back for the calamari and the spring rolls with shrimp, pork, and lettuce. The peanut sauce complements the rolls, I recommend it! Service is great, I never had a problem with my waiters. Expect a wait-time if you arrive on a busy day, this place is popular for their dishes, you'll have to sign in on a sheet of paper up front until they call your name. If you're in the Vegas area, this place is a must if you're looking for affordable food that will leave you full and satisfied!",

Besides the name being a great play on word pronunciation (not for small children), we really like their food.  Admittedly we've done almost exclusively Pho dishes, everything is always good.   My wife usually gets the \"Vegan\" Pho and adds fried tofu. The veggies are fresh, the noodles are great and the broth is tasty, even without any chicken stock or beef broth. The food is always served promptly, and piping hot.   I usually get the special Pho with beef. I always add either broccoli or bok choy so I can feel like I've had my veggies and because it's good. They put plenty of meat in the dish and like my wife's example always fresh and hot with a broth that makes me want to drink from the bowl.   The egg roles are really good  The crispy whole chicken is amazing   The bun BBQ pork on cold noodles with fish sauce is also terrific.   Normally you can't give a 5 rating to a Pho place because the service usually sucks. The positive here is that the staff is friendly and prompt. Keep in mind traditional eating times are busy and there are no reservations.   I highly recommend a visit because this place is Pho-bulous",

    "text": "Given how often I'd see them pop up in my Yelp feed late at night, I'd long wondered if Pho Kim Long was actually good or just a post-clubbing sort of spot.  They have a ton of reviews, most of which don't mention being here in the wee hours of the morning, but it'd also be fair to say a good chunk of their business comes well after midnight.  Then again, who cares?  Cheap pho is always good, especially to save a few bucks in Vegas!  In all seriousness though, I was actually pretty excited to finally try Pho Kim Long, even despite running into a line at 9pm (a sign they might actually be good!).  Now, maybe it's just because I'm used to divy pho spots in the Bay Area, but I was impressed with how big and clean this place is!  Similarly, the menu and all of its options looked great as well.  Though there were a bunch of things I wanted to try, I already knew what I had to get...  -- CHA GIO - Kim Long Fried Egg Rolls (Chicken)...$6.75 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=P2xPJWxXog67RHLVL3mnPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>) Decent, but not among the better ones I've had.  While the rolls were both meaty and sizable for the money, the flavors fell short for me.  Mainly, I just wish they had used pork instead of chicken (it was kind of dry).  That said, I did like how golden and crispy they were!  -- PHO DAT BIET - Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup...$8.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=dK-d8vH9JT9IfchjGbqzKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>) I wasn't expecting this to disappoint, but I was still pleasantly surprised!  The broth wasn't too shabby (beefy and not too oily) and the bowl was pretty large and chock full of stuff.  That said, the noodle to meat ratio was heavily skewed to the latter, as this was rather light on the carbs.  As far as service goes, I have to agree with others that it's definitely not their strong suit.  While there wasn't any singular issue for us, most of the staff was a bit dismissive of us.  I know - not exactly atypical of pho joints, but the staff wasn't typical of most pho joints either (read: younger, no grumpy, impatient old guys).  All in all, the THREE AND A HALF STARS is dead on, but I rounded down despite how their pho is pretty decent.  They're definitely better than just a late night spot (open 24 hours!), but not good enough to endure the inevitable wait.  I'm more inclined to try one of the other pho joints I've seen than to come back, but I'm still glad I finally made it here!",

I ordered a Pho Ga and when it came, I realize the chicken was not the usual shredded chicken you would get after you boil it fresh. The broth was not as good as the soups I am used to but overall, it helped cure me after a night of drinking. This place is 24/7 which is a huge plus since you can get noodles any time you want.

This is probably the biggest Pho place I've ever been to, and it's even opened 24/7. It was SUPER packed when I came here around 11am. You need to first sign in at the front counter.  Sign in sheet can get a little confusing. Please make sure you sign in on the FIRST page. Unless all 3 columns are filled up, then you would sign in on the second page.   Honestly, there should be a staff member at the front counter, facilitating the sign-in sheet.  Service was quite fast. However, I expected the food to be much better. In terms of portion size for the pho, well... they give you a lot of soup, but not much noodle or meat. Also, the soup had a cinnamon smell and taste to it, which I found really weird...   The food here is a little more pricey than other pho places. If you like broken rice, there's not many options for you to choose from the menu.   Before you use the chopsticks and spoons, please clean them. The boxes that contain these utensils are dusty.",

    "text": "Actual rating is 4.5 stars. (Knocked off .5 for taste of the pho - see below)  Honestly I think service might be variable depending on what time you come to this establishment. I can't speak on behalf of all others that have came recently but my experience here was great on 8/4/2019. My group of friends and I (total of 6 people) came here at 11am for brunch before heading back home to California. We were provided water as soon as we sat down and our order was taken in a promptly manner despite the restaurant being at full capacity. We ordered 2 plates of eggrolls, 3 pho tai, 2 pho dac biet, 1 bun bo hue, and an appetizer of xa xiu(barbecue pork). The bill came out to be about ~110 with gratuity included. I wouldn't say we waited more than 15 min for the appetizers to come out and our main entries came out quickly after that as well. The hospitality level was great and we were checked on multiple times if the food tasted good or if we needed any water refills. One thing I did notice that I've never seen before at any Viet restaurant was that the servers handed us each separate plates and complementing fish sauce dipping containers per person for the egg rolls. That definitely was nice although not the usual you'd expect. The eggrolls paired with the fresh lettuce, mint leaves and pickled veggies was an excellent start to our meal. You honestly can't go wrong with that appetizer. The pho had generous portions of meat but the broth as others have noted is pretty basic. You can tell they boiled the beef bones to at least create the base for the broth but it was lacking a bit of seasoning. It can salvaged with the hoisin sauce, sriracha, and/or fish sauce but if you're traditional type and don't like to mix it into your broth then you'd feel broth was on the blander side. My boyfriend loved the xa xiu appetizer. It is one of their more expensive appetizers at 12-13.50 dollars (can't remember the exact price) but it was definitely tasty and a generous portion of sliced barbecue pork. I didn't personally try the bun bo hue but my friend that did said she enjoyed the dish as well. Unfortunately I didn't get any pics of our food before we demolished everything! Pho Kim Long definitely met our expectations and hit the spot at least for good last ending note of our Vegas trip!",

It's so awkward to watch.   Now for the food, I've had their Pho Dac Biet but it wasn't good enough to remember. Now, my go to is the Bun Thit Nuong (vermicelli noodles with charbroiled pork and shrimp) and sometimes with egg rolls on the side. It comes out super fast no matter how crazy busy the restaurant is. The egg rolls are pretty good but you cannot screw that up anyways. Recently, I had the Bun Bo Hue and the soup was just warm. I did not get much noodles either :-(   Okay now for the service, it's in the middle of crappy and having to flag someone down for drink refills. It's frustrating but understandable to a certain extent. I also know that you have a choice to tip or not, but my friend gets called out every single time he does not tip. I end up having to cover on his part. They do it in a rude manner as well. Oh yeah and some Uber did a hit and run on my car last time I stopped by soo....fuck this place.",

We had to ask to see the menus again.  As we waited for the hostess to come back my two brother in laws brought their own food with take out bags into the restaurant.

We were told that it's their policy and refused even though it was a total wait of 30 minutes. I explained that we waited so long and was treated poorly while we were in their restaurant but she insisted that it's in their policy that they can go eat outside because they can't bring outside food into their restaurant. I suggested that at least they can make an exception this one time. The hostess was really rude and we felt we had to rush out for their next guest to be seated.  No one came by to check if we needed refills or if our meals were to or expectations/ liking. We couldn't find our waitress. The only time we saw her was because of our check needed to be paid.

I had some fresh spring rolls with shrimp inside. The dipping sauce was really good with it too. My GF had some bun which was also made to perfection. My other friends got pho and they enjoyed their meals equally. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys great traditional Vietnamese food after the club in the middle of the night or any given time of the day. Will be returning to enjoy more when I am not so buzzed LOL",

    "text": "If you notice throughout even good reviews, there's a consistent complaint about service. I had been going to his restaurant for nearly a decade and I can attest that this is True.  The service in this establishment was never stellar.  However, I've worked in the service industry myself. I'm not an entitled person. I dislike the social norm we have in retail or the service industry that the customer is always right or that employees have to over-the-top friendly and fake nice.   So, with this establishment, I didn't mind ignoring the fact the service was consistently average or below average. I assumed if we got in and got out, we'd have no problems with staff. My last visit will be my last since they dipped even below my \"below average\" expectation. My most recent visit my party was yelled at for being in the way. No, \"excuse me\" or even a flat \"go over there.\"   We were barked at, \"you can't stand here!\" When we were being shown our seats, one of the other waitresses pushed me out of the way because she didn't want to wait the few seconds for me to take my seat. I had witnesses to this. We were stunned into silence.   When our waitress came, she gave us ONE water. We never got a refill because she never came back except to chuck down our check and promptly leave. I see other reviewers giving the staff excuses like, \"they deal with drunk customers.\" This was mid-day.  Additionally, as someone who's worked in the industry for quite some time, even graveyard, you're friendly to everyone until someone isn't and you return the same energy. You don't default to being disrespectful and rude.   If it was one rude employee, I don't mind. But when it's every member of staff you come across, no. Don't disregard other reviewers about staff. They'll be disrespectful to you too regardless of how nice or friendly you are to them. You're not going to find yourself being the exception. My party wasn't behaving unusual or different. We were quiet and tried to be as easy as possible. It just wasn't enough for them.   Their food quality has also dropped to where it isn't worth it to deal with rude staff. Honestly, I'm not difficult to please and I'm extremely flexible. Way beyond what I should allow, but this was too much. I deserve better. Their customers deserve better.",

We ordered 4 special pho: I don't normally order pho at Vietnamese restaurant since the family can do it. I was completely surprised with this pho. Most of restaurants will combine their broth with a beef paste to keep it economical and you will taste an unnatural sweetness. When the pho arrived, it has a unique aroma and I new that this is will good.   The broth was on point, with certainty, this restaurant uses a lot of beef bone, ox tail and a hint of chicken bone in their stock.   They didn't filled the bowl with lot of noodle, which is a plus. There were plenty of beef, beef ball and tripe, and they didn't skimmed on the herbs.   Solid",

Now to the pho, yeah its just soup what makes it good? why is this place so good compared to the rest the broth! hands down greatest broth in LV, so much flavor. Now asian restaurant are notoriously known for bad service if your not asian haha but yeah it was good, what i care about in every restaurant no matter expensive or hole in the wall is my water; if you as a restaurant cant do a simple task like this as to keep any of your customers water filled up or even acknowledge if they would like some water than you have failed and well thank you pho kim long for my water! The atmosphere is well cant explain it much cause every time i eat here its 6am in the morning im wasted and this place is packed with as many people who are wasted as me. Overall this is the best pho place in LV, and if your around chinatown at 5am in the morning swing by and check it out for yourself.",

It doesn't make it any better that I reside by a Pho Kim Long in the San Jose area. But I digress. Now onto the review! This place is where my family and I go to when we need our pho fix. It's seems perpetually open and a convenient drive from the strip. The staff is surprisingly nice and upbeat on all my visits (something you don't really experience from any other pho restaurant no matter what time you go there.). Reasonably priced and good food. This restaurant sets the bar on Vietnamese restaurants. I will definitely go again if I'm ever in Vegas and want pho. I have even recommended people here.",

Sure, it may not compare to pho in San Jose (if you're ever up in norcal you've gotta try Pho Kim Long in SJ!) or Westminster, but this is the best pho you're gonna get in vegas. And it sure beats the americanized version they serve at TI.  And I've never made it after a night at XS, but it's open 24 hrs so you can get a headstart on that hangover cure.",

The menu is visual and multiple pages so you can actually get lost trying to make a decision.  It can be pretty packed in the evening,  and nearly impossible to get a seat in under 30 minutes in the early am after the clubs let out.  The staff is pretty attentive and gets food out in about 15-20 minutes after its ordered.  The dishes are served family style,  meant to be shared,  but i often eat an entire dish to myself.  I usually order the delicious spring rolls (cold),  the deep fried tofu pillows,  and either the seafood phad thai,  or the honey walnut shrimp,  which melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend pho kim long.  The fact that it is 24 hours, makes this a super useful spot to get your Vietnamese good fix anytime of the day or night!  Cheers!   -MikeB",

It IS called PHO Kim Long so you gotta try their pho and nothing else because my aunt did NOT enjoy her Com Suon Nuong (rice with grilled pork?). I'm not sure if it's always packed on weekends but when my family and I arrived at 11AM on a Sunday, it was a full house.  Service was mediocre.  Our server could have been more attentive.  It took a really long time for our pho to come out due to the party of 15 before us.  Other than that, Pho Kim Long was a good experience.

Definitely looks a bit fancier than your average pho restaurants, probably because it is in Vegas. Open 24 hours so that is a great plus! I guess it does have to be since it is again..in Vegas.  The food was ok, i had their Beef Luc Lac (sauteed beef filet pieces in traditional Vietnamese marinade served with salad and rice). Now the meat was tender, but what i wish they did differently was served me some flavor rice. Most Vietnamese restaurants serve Tomato Flavored rice with their beef, this place just had plain ol steamed rice which was a bit bland and dry for me.   Also i had one of their lemonade drinks, it was warm and only had a few pieces of ice in it. My parents had the pho, which looked and smelled good but they definitely looked small. My grandparents had the traditional Vietnamese dinner with stewed fish and sweet and sour soup. They loved it, so hey it must mean something.  Anyways, go here for a nice change from fancy restaurants and buffet in Vegas! Never close!",

    "text": "\"what?!\", \"where did you want to eat?!\", \"HAHA! huh?!\" Those are just some of the weird reactions I get when I say I want to eat here. I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.  The service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)  Never had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha! Go for the pork vermicelli, add the sauce they give you with some of the oyster (brown) sauce and a bit of the hot sauce and you'll be good! Have some fun saying the restaurant when suggesting to eat here! Happy eating! :)",

Although they have not visited Asia, let alone Vietnam, their taste relies on the Americanized versions of Asian food... After reading many reviews, we arrived with open minds and empty stomachs yearning for hometown goodness...  We were seated immediately and water was provided... The menu is huge, to say the least, and contains a mix of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai dishes and flavors... Our order was taken within 5 minutes of seating...   Fresh spring rolls were lacking shrimp and pork... Just a smidge and over powered by lettuce and noodle... The peanut dipping sauce was par for out of a jar, but the nuoc cham sauce was weak...   The pho arrived with lemon wedges... What...???... A first for us... The server stated they were out of limes so they use lemons... Our friends had the pho so I did not sample it, and therefor, cannot review the flavors... The bean sprouts were raw and only mint was provided... Where is the basil...???...   The bbq pork vermicelli dish contained very little pork... Was mostly lettuce and noodle... Thought I was eating deconstructed fresh spring rolls... The deep fried egg rolls were over cooked, but ok...  The clams in black pepper sauce was a mistake, as was the seafood bowl... As an exporter of seafood in Vietnam, wife definitely know her business... Shrimp is chemically treated so was slimy and tough texture... The baby squid was tough and over cooked...   The staff was normal... Never went out of their way or asked how we got along... Our friends paid the bill and were not harassed regarding a tip...  Overall, our experience was just under par... There are many other Vietnamese cafes with tastier dishes... Since this place is located in the touristy section on the edge of Chinatown, it is ok for Americanized desires... We will not return...",

The place does not scream authentic with the plates and the layout.      Food Overall, I liked the pho.  It's good after hours club food.  There are other dishes like the pan fried noodles that are tasty as well.  The prices are cheap as it is Vietnamese food.  The portion sizes are big and that helps with rating the place higher.         Service The customer service was decent.  For Asian places, they usually come and take the order and give the food.  Nothing else that is super special.  That is what I felt when I was in the place.",

    "text": "**MAD RANT from a Viet Chick** This is NOT the same Pho Kim Long in Milpitas, NorCal, that we NorCalers all know and love. SHAM, I say!  As Queen Nicki reiterates, \"I don't need NO FRAUDS\"  Why is there is a waitlist of 15+ people with over an hour wait? I don't freaking know. But I am as bewildered and perplexed as you.  The pho here is literally a turn-off. If you eat enough pho, you can snuff out MSG in your dreams. Unfortunately with such a busy business, Pho Kim Long decided to take shortcuts and add a bunch of MSG into their flavorless, bland pho broth. But even that didn't save the noodle soup. Noodles were hard in texture, and meat was mediocre cuts. I got the Pho Ga (chicken), and I think they went to Safeway and bought slices of deli white chicken meat and just threw it in my bowl. The chicken slices were anorexic. WTF Pho Kim Long. You can't even get fresh real chicken with a Ranch 99 across from you?! #outrageous  At a pho place, if your pho isn't even good, I don't even want to try the other foods. Please focus on making good pho. NorCal, SoCal, and all of Cali has way way way way better pho. 100% disappointed by the foods.  The only positives were the super fast and friendly service and \"affordable\" prices. But I wouldn't pay above $3 for that monstrosity. Returning? I think not.",

    "text": "Pho Kim Long... I know I'll probably end up coming at 2:00 in the morning still, but this last time was whack as hell. Story time:  Vegas clubbing leads to late night pho at the top spot for it in Chinatown. Twenty-four hours a day, crowds of people come and wait to enjoy a nice steamy bowl of noodles. This place is only good at night when you get the drunchies but that's not the point.  On a weekend in April when we were here, PKL's handling of a pretty scary situation left me annoyed and upset at the management. My friends and I were seated near the main doors where the bouncer and customers were waiting to be seated. We were eating our food and was simply letting time pass for us to sober up from going out.  Well, sober up we did. Before we knew it, something had happened where the glass door shattered and people started screaming and running into the restaurant. Someone shouted \"gunshots\" and immediately chaos ensued. A few of us in my party ducked and ran towards the back, while others used toppled tables for protection. You can't even imagine the level of uncertainty and fear that everyone was facing.  We ended up finding out that someone had smashed the front door with a crowbar out of frustration at the bouncer. We knew the restaurant had to close and we knew leaving was the best place for us to feel safe. I come to find out out later that the management demanded everyone to still pay for their food despite being completely frazzled- my friend included.   It's one thing to demand everyone pay versus suggesting it when the entire restaurant had just erupted in pure chaos. To me, this came off as not caring about your safety and more-so making sure nobody leaves without first paying despite cops on scene and folks frantically trying to figure out what had happened.  The management will likely remain the same so this was simply story time for those out here late at night. Be safe because you never know what could happen!",

I usually order pho' but this time around I chose the wonton egg noodle soup instead and thought the broth was tasty and everything in it was delicious. Spring rolls are also one of our favorite appetizers. Overall one of best Asian food restaurants to eat at while in LV.",

I asked my server which is better the house special noodles or the Udon noodles.  The server asked me if I wanted do the combo for udon noodles.   I said sure and he brings me two plates. I thought it was the combo plates and apparently it was house special noodles and the udon noodles. I asked the server to make its not two different entree cause I only wanted the better one. He brings the menu and points to the two things and I said. I told him I asked you what's better from those two?  And then he starts arguing with me saying well you ate one the shrimp on this dish. I told him I order a combo so I thought you brought what I ordered and you placed these dishes on the table.   I asked him I want to talk  to his manager which was the owner of the restaurant- Jason. He comes out and takes the dish away I told him in a restaurant if you place a dish down on the table you can't take it back. The owner just replied you didn't order it. Obviously I didn't order the dish! The owner does not know restaurant etiquette. I got so pissed I didn't even bother to eat the rest (I only had sampled the dishes, almost full dishes) and was done with the owner, the workers, and the restaurant; the bonus is I was still charged.

    "text": "This place is like a 3 at best. For me, this is definitely not the best place for Viet cuisine but they do a good job considering it's Vegas and it's open 24 hrs. I definitely needed an asian fix down in vegas and this place is really well known.  The service at 11 am was friendly and attentive. I must say, if you need a pick-me-up, their viet iced coffee hits. Like 2x more than a regular coffee. Loved the chicory flavor and the brew was strong as fuhhh but I needed it. Would definitely recommend.  I must say I am very very particular about Viet food since we have abundant options in Seattle. I am also highly picky about my cha gio and bo kho. I really needed something nostalgic so I opted to try to the bo kho. Man. I probably should have gotten the rice plate instead. The bo kho with rice noodles were subpar. The noodles were decent but the beef stew itself was a 2 star. The pros were the tender meat that just melted in your mouth. It was different types of meat and helllla beef (more than any Seattle portion). That was filling and tasty. However, the broth was bland and tasted more like a pho broth than stew. Very loose and had no uumph to it at all. The dish had no body to it and no distinct spices.   Now the cha gio  (chicken egg rolls) were okay. I'm picky because I can make good egg rolls too but this one was decent. Nothing memorable for ~$5-$6. Good sauce though and loved the pickled carrots!  The spring rolls with shrimp were really good though. I must say the roll was so tender and everything was just so refreshing and clean. The soft wrapper really impressed me and the noodles were really soft too. I loved their thick peanut sauce and would definitely eat this again!  Overall, great service for Asians. Decent priced. For all of this we spent less than 40 bucks. And portions were pretty big for noodles. Next time I'd probably try the rice plates. Lots of menu items (includes chinese and thai dishes) to choose from. There's a parking lot but I heard on the weekends it is crazy packed.",

It's usually not that busy, but enough for me to wait every time for our server to come around, they will bring your food, check up on you ONCE, then never attend you again lol. If you want to pay your bill you'll have to get up and go to register.  One time I came in tried to order to go and their was people waiting to be seated and I could not wait so I left. You'd think that on weekend nights they'd be a little more staffed but nope they're not. ONE time though I do have to mention, I was pretty drunk I went up to pay with the young cashier towards the back, I gave him $20 in cash then my debit card. Which is pretty obvious how I wanted to pay right? $20 in cash and 20 on the card. Simple right? NOPE. The guy either pocketed the cash or used it as tip for them. CRAZY I did not notice until AFTER. I was pretty drunk so the fact that he took advantage of the opportunity pissed me off. A second time I come here, I paid with my debit card, again either they charged me + never gave it back or they kept it. Called the next day they said NOPE its not here,bye. Lmfao long story short you will get taken advantage of here if you're drunk after 1am, and the service is shitty. The food is too good though so I come back for the convenience.",

We were there at 3am with a group of six and it took us a while to get seated. The broth is A-Okay, noodles and meat were standard. I feel like the pho here is just average, but it's the perfect way to end a long night of clubbing on the strip.",

I had gotten to Vegas right around lunch time, so I figured I'd get some quick and light Vietnamese food.    There was a much longer wait than I expected.  The staff was fast to turn tables as soon as folks were done, so I knew they were doing their best.  Once seated, the pork chop and rice dish ordered by my neighboring table caught my eye.  It was fairly good.  The pork was moist and not dried out.  The Vietnamese baked egg (kind of like a quiche) was round like it was made in a ramekin.  It had a good texture and fresh (some restaurants serve ones that are dried out and you can tell they've been reheated, but not here).  My family members order the pho, which was good as well.  All in all, it's definitely worth another visit the next time I'm there.",

I really don't get the hype about this location. The broth is not really that great, but people crave this location. I wouldn't make a special trip here just for the soup. They have an expanded Chinese and Thai menu, but I wouldn't recommend ordering these overpriced dishes as you will be disappointed. I do enjoy the calamari with fried garlic and jalapenos as this fresh preparation style is not seen elsewhere. Their vermicelli noodle bowl is pretty standard with other locations and won't disappoint. Spring rolls aren't too bad either.   They give you a filled water cup right away upon seated. They don't have pots of tea available; just a cup of hot water and a tea bag was presented upon ordering. Apparently they don't do that here, which is weird for this type of cuisine. Service can be good, but it can get busy as everyone really helps the other tables out. Don't be surprised if there's a wait list for 10-15 minutes; however, I would find other options if the wait is longer than 20 minutes.",

The pho is quality and although the service isn't the quickest ever, it isn't bad. I love and am very critical about the taste of pho that I eat, but I can honestly say that this place has some pretty good pho, even compared to the many places I've been to in the past. Not only that, but they also give you a decent sized portion for a large.   I was with two Viet friends who often get homemade pho from their parents, and they both said that the pho was good. That should DEFINITELY count for something.  The moral of this review? I'm going to continue going to this restaurant every Vegas trip, and you should too.",

We ordered that, Beijing beef, Mongolian beef, fried rice, and calamari. I personally don't think the Mongolian n Beijing beef are super delicious but my friend did. I only enjoyed the bun + pork n the calamari (although I think the calamari has thick batter n I can really feel it's greasy after u eat so much). So I guess it's back to your preference. In term of food, it's not bad. I will give it a try again n try other dishes, if ever I'm back in this town. Price wise is decent. Our bill was about $70 for everything we ordered including 2 bottles of beer.",

    "text": "2016 - New Review from November 2016  Awarded the Best in Las Vegas by all the Las Vegas publications - Pho Kim Long Restaurant - Listen to the delicious smells of the sizzling seafood, shrimp, scallops, and steak with ginger at the Las Vegas favorite Pho Kim Long on Spring Mountain and Valley View in Chinatown near the Chinatown Plaza by Highway 15 across from Fashion Mall. Clay pots, sizzling plates, steak, noodles, pho, udon, shrimp, fresh seafood, black bean sauces, beer, wine, fruit drinks for children, and sauces, enjoy a variety of flavors with their outstanding sauces. Try the Chow Fun Noodles dry or with a beef gravy sauce.  4029 W Spring Mountain Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89102  2015 - Old Review from 2015  CES 2016, your restaurant was packed. For months, we have seen a line out the door on Spring Mountain, but I guess, because you were right down the street from the entrance to CES, many of the people came, but they came because your dishes were so good. No one else went to the restaurants around you. We went to Lee's for sweet drinks of boba pearl fruit smoothies for the children, but never stood in line. Finally, we decided to stand in line. The wait was worth it. Now we have returned twice. The seafood dishes, noodle soups with shrimp - Lots of shrimp - the thick chow fun noodles in black bean sauce with grilled beef steak. Pho Kim Long has an extraordinary menu with curry flavors, beef noodles, excellent broth, shell fish, and the place is always packed. See for yourself. Leave the Las Vegas Strip to drive west on Spring Mountain. Pass Valley View. Pho Kim Long is right there in the Chinatown center on the left as you drive west. You will be glad you did. Plus the place is open 24 hours, but we usually try to get there before 6 pm after my son gets out of school. Sincerely, Thomas Chee",

I've been here a bunch of times already and I'll admit it's my favorite place to go FOR THE FOOD only. Rarely ever do I get greeted upon arrival or when I leave. This place is always packed considering the fact that it is open 24/7, and the wait time for a table always varies between 20-30 min during peak hours. Trust me, if you visit this place during peak hours, good luck finding a seat to wait or a place to stand cause there's not much space to do so. The servers don't really seem like they care about their customers, they're just there to pretty much \"serve\" you your food. They all look like they hate their jobs and don't wanna be there, and at times it's so busy that they're all just running around and rushing to get a table vacant asap for the next party.   Unfortunately, I come here so often that I started not caring about the customer service I receive either bc the food makes up for it. My boyfriend and I always get their pho, spring rolls, and calamari, which we loooooove! Their chicken pad Thai is also bomb. The price is pretty reasonable for the portions they give. I really wish they improve on their customer service soon, business seems to be booming here so it's no excuse to lack good customer service.",

The noodles were also over cooked in both our pho dishes. The vegan broth lacked flavor. The meat in the combo pho consisted of mostly cartilage although the broth was good. The sprouts were slimey and discolered! Should not be served!   Two stars for friendly service and atmosphere. Vegan options always a plus!The spring rolls were pretty solid as well as the tofu.

Today I went for lunch with my friends and reluctantly got #13.. It was really good today. The serving was generous and it came out quickly. I know that can be a bad thing but it was a good thing today since we were hungry. The amount of meat for the price was good also. The broth was good and they have us a generous amount of herbs and sprouts.  We got two appetizers the crab rangoons and the egg rolls. They were both good but nothing special.  I took the time out to write this quick review because the service was so good today.  Usually the staff is pretty short and rude.  Today they were attentive, polite, and efficient. We had like 4 people help us.  It seems with the increased business they're getting they took the time to improve the service.  I was just really pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.  I've had their drunken noodles which is a Thai dish that they actually do a really good version of.  They have good food for sure so if you were reluctant to eat here because of bad service I'd say to give them another chance.",

On occasion the food isn't perfect (I've never experienced this). But you know what, this place has always had my back in the middle the night shenanigans. And for that I will always have theirs.",

We were in Vegas for 4 days and my friends had to make their second round to Pho Kim Long before we left. I was sad I missed out on that second trip lol",

I was like I wasn't going to leave without paying and how dare you treat me like this... I wouldn't have gone to the counter if I wasn't going to pay... He started taking receipts and slapped one at a time on top of each other on the counter. he was like these are the people who didn't pay. i cursed him out and told him it was an insult if he thought i was going to do that. You idiot! I went back to the table and asked my cousin to take my keys and go to the car to get my purse. She just gave me the money and I paid without giving a tip. It was such an insult.

Food: Pho broth is a bit too plain for me. Portion is the smallest I've seen, except for Jenny's Pho in SW LV, that's even smaller.  The price listed is for SMALL, but they don't tell you that. It's $7.25 for SMALL. You can't get steak with beef balls.  You have to get one or the other. But if you want both, it's an extra $1.00.  So for a large, it's $8.25 + 1 = $9.25 for a \"Large\" which is actually very small.    Drink: No comment since only got water.   Bottom Line:  Food is so so but very expensive. One waitress is hot.

One star for the service. Server was a little rude and took until almost the end of our meal to bring our drinks. I had the mango smoothie, thinking it would have actual mango in it, but no. It was sickly sweet and very artificial tasting, I couldn't even drink it but also couldn't find my server to send it back, so ended up paying for it even though I didn't like or drink it. Our server disappeared after hurriedly dropping off our drinks, and 45 minutes after we were done eating and obviously waiting were we finally able to flag down another server to bring our check. We might be back because the Pho was tasty and they are open late, but hopefully the service will be better at normal dinner hours. Not a great first experience.",

I WISH I HAD GONE TO THIS PLACE MUCH SOONER before we moved away from Las Vegas!!  The service was pretty good, just the right amount of checking to make sure we had everything we needed, but not so much that we felt rushed.    I was a little apprehensive at first but since my co-workers swore by it i decided to get whatever they recommended.  The Pho i got was amazing.  I loved adding the bean sprouts and other things they brought to the table for us to it, I especially loved adding the different sauces they  had at the table (mostly hot sauce was what i added since I'm sucker for spiciness). It was very filling and very delicious, i couldn't even finish it all and had to take it home!  The only food i didn't like was the spring rolls I think is what they were.  My friends had ordered them before I got to the restaurant so I didn't have a say in it, but seafood is not my thing and these had shrimp in them I believe so that pretty much killed it for me on them. Plus the dipping sauce was some kind of peanut based sauce......I've had other peanut based sauces at other places which I've liked, but this one was just too thick for my liking.    Otherwise I love this place and will definitely have to make it a priority to go here when I visit friends in Las Vegas.",

And I asked him \"why do you say that for?\" And he giggled \"oh cause I thought he was high.\" Mind you my husband was right in back of me and I didn't want him to hear because I know he get really upset. But to late cus he heard and so my husband asked the boy \"why would you say that for?\" The boy replied \" oh I just thought he was drunk \" and which went on for a couple more times. I was so upset because that is not what happened and for the boy to judge my friend because he has dread locks?!? That's wrong in so many ways. Little did you know he was dehydrated.! Never coming here again, and to that boy. Grow up.",

    "text": "BEWARE OF THE RUDENESS. I came here with my boyfriend before heading to the airport. We were surprised at the line that already started around 9 a.m. but we decided to wait in line. There were 15 other people ahead of us and there was no standing room inside so we had to wait outside with our luggage. Thankfully, the weather wasn't dreadful at that time of morning yet. My boyfriend stepped inside to use the restroom and I continued to wait outside. I heard his name being called and it took me LESS than 30 seconds to get inside with the two luggage. I approached the host table and the host was no where to be found. I waited there for about 7-8 minutes and when he came back, I told him my boyfriend's name and he said, yea I called his name already. And just like that he dismissed me and didn't give me anymore information. When I tried to ask him what can we do about it, since he already scratched out his name, he ignored me and carried on sitting other groups down the list. When my boyfriend came out, he had to talk to a manager for us to get seated. I was already furious at that point but hoped the food outweighed the service. Unfortunately, the shrimp fried rice I ordered was dreadful! I wish I would of read the reviews before ordering it. Had the host attempted to resolve the matter in a professional and respectful way, I would of considered trying out this place again but I would not come back here after that experience.",

The waiters have always been rude and slow to serve. The pho is way too overpriced and the portions are small. Even with the siracha and hoisin sauce it lacked flavor. It wasn't the worst but it wasn't great. The beef is gross so I started just ordering the noodles only. I hate that they use a lot of white onions. They give lemon, no lime. The only reason I went multiple times was because I was pregnant and NEEDED pho lol. Now that I'm no longer pregnant I will never return.   Egg rolls were good. Taro was not sweet and definitely a waste. Thai tea sucked too! Save your money.",

Her response is pretty much we will seat you when we seat you - first come first serve. If a restaurant is busy thats great, however it would be nice to let your customers know if its going to be 5mins or an hour. I witnessed another guest waiting prior to me walked outside for a smoke or whatever and when he came back he asked how much longer the host told him she called his name and he got skip...Well if you wouldve told him how long he would've known to stay inside..thats where the lack of communication needs to be fixed. The whole first come first serve is bs. They will seat a bigger group before you if they need to. When it was time for my friends and I to get seated, the host \"pointed\" to the table for us to sit at, not walk us to the table- pointed. Okay, Sure.. Walking to the table another employee(who an earlier guest asked him how long the wait is said he didn't work at the restaurant- mind you this guy was wearing a \"Pho Kim Long\" shirt! LOL hmm.. WTF?!) anyways this guy stops us and told us not to sit at the table then the host saw us standing around and told us to sit.. its fine just sit.. its was back and forth for a minute. I finally just sat myself at an open table bc this was just beyond bad. So we sat waitress takes our order ( doesn't write anything down) order comes out and of course one of the dish was wrong, we told the a lady (the owner?) she came back with the right order she was very nice (thats the one star) the food was good (second star)UNTIL my sisters Pho had a bug in it (extra protein?) and my pho had a good size piece of plastic vinyl thing in it. So that completely ended our meals :)",

Came along and got seated right away, seemed pretty busy so by this point I'm wondering how good this place is goings to be.  Decided to get my usual, pho vegan.  Food came out with in 5 minutes, huge portion, plenty of vegetables and over all with the taste, not bland, not to salty, noodles were to perfection and I was very much satisfied.  However the satisfaction for their service went down when I asked one of the servers that came to pour in water if they had sake bombs or just bottles of sake. She said he doesn't know and told me she would go ask our waiter. Fair enough, though you should know the menu at the restaurant you're working at.  My waiter doesn't come an 15 minutes later I was forced to grab another waiter. He helped me out and got my drink.   Got my drink, happy with my food. I was ready to go and leave. Yet our waiter once again has us waiting for another 15 minutes. I must say, good food but bad service. I'll be back to give it another try.",

Our party of 8 only waited 10 mins to get seated. + Many food options to choose from the menu from salt and pepper chicken wings to pho. + Located across the freeway from the Las Vegas strip. + Great location near by other Oriental shops.  Cons + The waitress did not want to separate the check for us. The male server who originally took our orders said we could pay separately at the cashier, but the female sever who handed us a single bill practically told us to divide it ourselves by informing us that they accept multiple credit cards. She quickly left the table after that statement.  + Waters were not refilled. + More expensive than other Vietnamese shops. + Fresh coconut cost $5.95!  + Food does not come out at the same time.  FOOD:  + Spring rolls: I was a little disappointed because for around $5 I received only two small spring rolls that mainly consistent of noodles. Only two layers of thin beef slices if I remember correctly. I do not recommend this as an appetizer.   + Pho Tai (regular): The broth is bland but still has taste. I find it refreshing. I like it because it's not oily but I don't love it. The regular size could use more beef slices.   + Pork and shrimp vermicelli: The pork had great char and flavor. It was perfectly grilled. The shrimp was medium size and average in taste. Noodles were soft and chewy and veggies were fresh. This entree came in a large sized bowl with a generous portion of meat and noodles.  + Garlic and pepper calamari: I would pass on this dish next time. I did not like the batter on the calamari. It reminded me of the batter from cheap beer batter onion rings. The squid itself tasted like rubbish and was not crispy. It was even more disappointing because the dish lacked flavor.",

I think I have had it before, my husband tells me I have, but funny thing is, I wouldn't know if I did.  I googled it and it seems I have had it, and more than once.  I didn't know the official name of what I was eating, just knew it was good. So now that I know what it is, I am on a quest to find the best and thought I could start here.  According to a few reviews, this place is supposed to have some really good Pho.  I picked out a charboiled pork with egg and thought it would be a little bit spicy, but it wasn't.  It was hot and hit the spot on this late night.  Is it one of the best, I cannot say that, but it's just the beginning of a tasty journey.",

We chose this spot because it had a ton of reviews and because it was 1am and open 24 hours a day lol. I love pho so I'm a bit picky about the broth and the meat. This place surely didn't disappoint, it's a short drive from the strip in the china town district, wait wasn't very long on a Sunday, only about 10 minutes. I recommend this place to anyone craving some awesome pho at any hour of the day!",

I had to work the next day so I definitely needed my voice to stay with me. My husband knows that at times like this I need Pho so he said he would find something to eat on Pho Kim Long's menu. He said he would settle for a salad because he wasn't really hungry.   Well just as a heads up to others that may be seeking salad ...there is none. He did find Beef and Broccoli which is kind of like salad. He ate almost all of it except the little bit I took to taste it. The amount that was given is easily a good amount for two to three people but he finished it even though he wasn't that hungry! The meat was well seasoned and the broccoli was nice and crispy. I hate soft broccoli!   I ordered the chicken fried rice for lunch this week at work since I came in on late Sunday I had no time to cook. It was pretty basic the chicken pieces didn't have any fat on them which is a good thing. I spiced it up with some Sriracha.   The Pho was good it wasn't too salty the veggies that came with it were fresh but I was surprised that they served it with lemon. When I usually get Pho I 've always been given limes to go with it. I wasn't going to be picky about it though. My Pho had the beef strips in it but it also came with these round meatballs . I didn't try it though ...I was wondering what it was . I concentrated on the broth just so my throat would feel better by morning. The Pho did help my throat on Monday but had to call in sick on Tuesday.",

Service was on point.   Water always being filled and very accommodating.  Server was friendly.   Overall very good experience.    Heard that there's usually there is a wait for a table but at lunch time on Saturday, we were seated immediately.   Inside was clean and modern.   Prices were fair and maybe a dollar less than some other places.   Will almost definitely be back.     The only reason it's a 4 and not a 5 is because the amount of meat and noodles was a little less than I'm used to.  If there was a 4.5 option, I would go with that.     I can recommend that pho without thinking twice.   This white guy says give it a try.",

He seemed as if he didn't want to be bothered at all and had the worst facial expressions as if every question aggravated him.  He came back with raw eggs in broth with vegetable broth in a separate bowl. When I explained what I wanted he responded with the worst attitude that this is not a American restaurant. I'm sorry, I thought I was in America but cannot figure out what bearing that had on the conversation. I remained nice and cordial, but When people treat you rude from the time you enter the business until the time you leave, you can't help but wonder if race plays a factor.. either way ignorance played one tonight.",

It turned out \"Kim Long\" means \"Golden Dragon\" in Chinese and Pho is obviously Vietnamese. The end result of this place is some freaking good Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.   We came here as a big group and got to order a great selection of dishes to try. Some of the highlights are their Stir- Fry Diced Beef cubes, Salt and Pepper fried Pork Chop, BBQ pork, Drunk Man Noodles, and deep fried spring rolls. Unfortunately, I did not get to try their Pho as I was holding my sleeping son so I only got 1 hand available to eat.   If I ever get to return to Vegas with a car, I would love to try this place again! It is open 24/7 so that means I can be here post-show :)",

I got alllllll excited thinking I was going to try \"the best Pho in Vegas\" at this popular spot and when I walked in I immediately realized I had been here like 4 years ago and forgot.  I bamboozled myself!   $45.96 got us a bowl of pho, chicken fried rice, two soft drinks, a coffee, and an order of chicken teriyaki.  Our servers were efficient and friendly and they called my son cute so they got extra brownie points for that.    $8.95 Pho Dac Biet- Piping hot (but not burn-your-mouth-off-lava-hot) and savory broth chock full of noodles, onions, cilantro, tendon, raw beef, and I was dreading finding a piece of tripe but never did so......whew! Dodged that bullet.  It came with plenty of bean sprouts, basil, and lime on the side.  Many condiments were provided on the table such as sriracha, chili oil, etc.  This would be great \"sick food\" if you weren't feeling well.    $10.95 chicken fried rice- It was average.  The rice was a bit small and mushy like it had been handled too much but it was full of peas, carrots, eggs, and chicken.  It was missing that charred umami flavor that I like in fried rice. I don't think they actually fried it which made it kinda mushy.  I wouldn't order this again.  But that's what I get for ordering fried rice at a pho place.    So, folks, stick to the pho if you go here and you'll have a good time.",

The waiter gave us our menus and he gave us time to look through the menu.   After we placed our order, we waited about 10 minutes to get all of our food (appetizer served first).

Some of my favorites are:  Deep fried chicken with dried garlic. Crispy skin and juicy flavorful meat. It's the closest I've ever gotten to a Filipino chicken BBQ.   Pho. Duh.   Grilled Pork Chop with rice.   Fresh Coconut Juice served with the coconut.   Be warned, your clothing and your hair will smell like pho after. So make sure this is your last stop. (Not unless you want everyone else to be jealous of where you've been, then please, don't let me stop you.)  Don't chat with your waiter. They're not into small talk. They want to feed you good food, as fast as they can, so you can be on your way to full-bellied happiness.   Pro-tip: If you're anywhere in Chinatown and the service is above mediocre, the food is going to be crap.",

Our party of 8 ordered various dishes that all came out in less than 10 minutes at midnight, when we dined there after a long day out on the town.   The orange chicken did not skimp on the chicken and the sweet and sour shrimp was done well.  I ordered my usual bun Tom Cha gio which is the vermicelli with shrimp and egg roll, that I use to gauge how authentic and good a Vietnamese restaurant is - everyone leaves the shrimp tail on but this place is the only one that de-shells it. Simple measure but pleasant surprise. Our pickiest eater who generally dislikes Asian cuisine said he wanted to come back, which says a lot.",

It was surprisingly very crowded... at 4 AM LOL but we were somehow seated (5 people) right away. I ordered pho with beef ball and it was GROSS! There was way too much msg in the broth, the noodles were half cooked, and the beef ball was not beef ball! I was not satisfied at all!! We also asked for hot sauce and dipping plates at least 3 times before they finally brought it to us...",

    "text": "Comfort food comes in many forms. For us, over the years since I and my guests have been coming here, comfort food is their cha gio (crispy hot, thin Vietnamese-style egg rolls that you wrap in a green-leafed lettuce with mint, basil and shredded daikon/carrot mixtures, then dip each in a flavorful fish sauce). Next, it's the vermicelli dish that has the grilled pork and shrimp which is sprinkled with chopped peanuts, topped with the tender grilled proteins, along with fresh veggies. We douse it with the house nuoc cham sauce! During past visits, we've had the pho and other noodle soups, their Chinese selections, including the roast duck (which at the time, my dad said it was the best he'd tasted in his long life).  PKL is located in the middle of a busy commercial center on Spring Mountain Road and the parking area sucks sometimes, so we grab a spot when one opens up and just use the stroll to work up our appetite and burn off calories after.   Finally figured out the best time to come to avoid the lines--3:30pm on a Sunday afternoon!  Actually, the wait times in the past haven't been too bad because we know it's worth the wait.",

    "text": "Seriously, what a disgrace to pho!! If you want less than mediocre pho with awful service, this is definitely the place for you!    First of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture.   Next, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter.   There's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a \"how are you?\" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.  Now the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.  The only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do.",

I wanted to order the tripe but they dont' have it there which is a surprise.    For being empty it did take a bit long for the food to come out but the service was good.  There just wasn't anything here that really jumped out at me but I wouldn't hesitate stopping by here if I was craving pho and there was no wait.",

Sorry to say that was the last time we visit this restaurant. QUALITY GONE.",

They are quick though so although the food comes out fast, the servers and bus boys are constantly whizzing past so it's a rushed atmosphere.  We ordered the shrimp spring rolls which I prefer to dip in hot sauce instead of the peanut sauce that comes with it.  I ordered the chicken vermicelli, it has noodles and salad and it's pretty good.  There is so much of it I was able to save some for lunch the next day.  My boyfriend ordered the beef pho, he loves it.  I tasted the broth and it is delicious.  My complaint is that if you have to use the bathroom or wash your hands, bring your own paper towels because no one cleans the bathroom or re-stocks anything, it is disgusting.",

No complaints there.  But the food was pedestrian. I eat a lot of pho, and Vietnamese food in general, and I left this restaurant feeling full, but not overwhelmed by the food quality.   My appetizer was spring rolls--here, the spring rolls are the soft rice paper. The shrimp in my spring roll were over cooked and mealy, and the rice in them was also overcooked and had a pasty consistency.  For my main course, I had pho Tom, which is Shrimp Pho. I ordered a large bowl...and was somewhat surprised at the size of the bowl that was delivered. It was smaller than what I usually get when I get a large bowl at my go-to spot in MD. The broth was flavorful, but the shrimp and noodle quantity was so-so. I will say that the shrimp was cooked well and had a nice, firm texture, unlike those in my spring roll.  As an accompaniment, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. It was overpoweringly sweet with a strange aftertaste. I drank it all; like looking at a car wreck, I couldn't help but do it. But I didn't quite enjoy it.  With all the choices that exist in Chinatown here in Vegas, I probably won't go back to Pho Kim Long.",

We arrived a little after 2am on a Wednesday night, there was a line and I didn't mind. I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.  So for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!  For entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while! I wasn't full although I was indeed satisfied. This is a nice place to go after a night of clubbing or even for a date. I will definitely be back again!",

Cons- I have never been served cold-to-lukewarm food before.  The soup was so cold that the beef in my pho was still lightly rare.  The portion was acceptable, but not for $10, because I was not full yet.  I had to make a second order of food just to get filled.  The flavoring was average, but the food was COLDer than I expected.  I brought the 2nd portion home so I could microwave it and continue my dinner.  2 stars",

We came here early before leaving town and ordered a few bowls of Pho and a plate of their house special fried rice. The Pho soup was bland, and the beef balls had a really grainy texture that we all couldn't eat. So the fried rice came out shortly, and there was nothing special about it. It had frozen peas, carrots, mini frozen shrimps, and a miniscule scatter of boiled pork   slices, thrown into a pile of yellow rice. It was soggy and also lacked any flavoring. It's hard to mess up fried rice.. And unfortunately there are a few establishments out there who take advantage of that notion and put in zero effort into it. There are tons of Pho shops in Vegas, so you'll have to keep up to stay up in the game.",

It was the best bowl of Pho that I had ever in a restaurant. Their Pho has the taste of a homemade pho taste. -Portion size for the food was worth it. $9 for a bowl of pho that filled me up. Also, their $4 Thai tea also was worth the money! It was so good and was served in a huge portion.  -Customer service was absolutely fantastic. They checked up on us periodically. We didn't have to waive them down, or ask them for anything, because they knew absolutely what we needed and wanted. They topped off our water, and even asked to top off my hydroflask.   I absolutely do not have anything to complain about this establishment. This restaurant pho is delicious in taste, and serve in a bowl that will fill you up. The customer service was also great just like their food!   I definitely recommend this place as a go to when you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "I rated this 3.5 stars and only rounded down since I did realize I don't usually go to have pho here, or anywhere, on my own usually. Only when friends want to go. It's not that I don't think pho is good food. It's just that I have so many other favorites that rank above it, so sue me hehe. That said, I have tried pho at alot of places but I've been here the most. That partly is due to its proximity to the Strip and being open 24hrs. Who am I kidding, those ARE the main reasons I've patronized this pho establishment more than any other pho spot. Friends visiting out of town, want late night eats nearby after gambling and/or partying all day/night.  I remember when it wasn't open late. Then it seemed like every year or 2 the closing time became 1hr later, next thing I know it's 24hrs! Pho spots are notorious for their horrible service. Although the last time I went recently the service was horrible. The pho came with a lemon wedge instead of limes and I got exactly one basil thai stem. And we could never find our waiter and ended up having 3 separate waiters help us. Besides that, the service has been pretty decent here. The broth doesn't taste noticeably better or worse than any of the other pho's I've had. I do get a little annoyed everytime I get my pho, the rare steak on top is already fully cooked from the heat of the broth. I should probably follow my one friend's lead and ask for the meat on the side so that doesn't happen but I always forget. If you eat at the hours I do, there probably is not many other options but during normal times when people eat, there are alot of pho choices scattered along Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown. I think it's a decent place for pho and it helps that you never have to worry if it's closed.",

And in those situations, thank GOD there's Pho Kim Long. OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY!!!  Heaven. Their pho is perfect. The thai iced tea with boba is also perfect. There's lots more I want to try. This was my first time there, and all I can say is it's JUST what I needed and I will most DEFINITELY be back.  I would have given 5 stars but all I've had there so far is pho and it was a bit pricey for pho. But tastewise I have no complaints, and a 24-hour vietnamese restaurant?...well that's not something you see just anywhere. Viva Las Vegas.",

    "text": "\"FUCK-HIM-LONG!\"... haha.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  =P  We came here after an informal wedding for a quick meal and then back to the hotel to get ready to leave the day later.  I don't believe we had reservations for 30+ people, but they were quick to accommodate us when arriving.  It seemed there was a prefixed menu negotiated for our large party, and it consisted of the typical Vietnamese family-style menu items you would see standard in any restaurant worth their salt.  For a pho restaurant, this is probably one of the nicer looking ones I've seen... of course, this is targeted towards the touristy crowds, but still a breath of fresh air compared to all of the hole-in-the-walls I've been to.  I asked around about Vietnamese restaurants, and even the cab driver [local native Vietnamese] recommended this place, and it did not disappoint.  We had canh chua, ca kho, fried rice, fried shrimp, etc... and it was so nice to have home style food to end our weekend of debauchery and make us miss home even more.  [5 days in Vegas is overkill... 3 IS MORE than enough for me!]  The part that made me happiest?  The had fresh coconut juice there, and when you order it, they serve you nothing else but a coconut straight up.  I had oodles of fun scraping at the meaty flesh to round out my meal, and we all left stuffed.  If I remember right, we had at least 4-5 tables and I don't remember the cost, but I do know it was quite cheap because I heard no one complaining... haha.  Also, for not having any reservations, the food came out promptly and steaming hot.  Not bad, but service was a tad spotty trying to flag down a server to get us more glasses for water.",

Service: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you. I think it is ridiculous to be asked 4 times by the same time if you are ready to order within a 7 minute span. It makes you feel like \"Hey we don't want to satisfy you, we just want your money and for you to leave.\" We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. \"No... We aren't\" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must've heard because she came back and took the check away. It has been feeling this rushed since they underwent their makeover a while ago. Food: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side. I have never had an issue with any food being bad. But I love their calamari and sometimes it is amazing and sometimes, well, it is just deep fried squid. Check it out and decide for yourself. The egg rolls are the only thing that stop me from giving it 3 stars.",

It's a eat and go restaurant because they will kick you out if your finish eating and talking. They actually told me to leave because they had people waiting for a table. I was there for less than an hour in a lunch meeting(RUDE). They are 24 hours and that's great but in the weekends they are packed. Overall the food is great the service is not great but it is 24 hours!",

When we came, we waited for about 8 minutes before being seated, since it was really busy. Almost everything was overpriced, in my opinion, for the quality and quantity of the food. I got the Japanese udon combo dish and it was $15.. for a plate not so big and there wasn't much to it. There were literally 2 shrimps on the entire plate, but we were given a little more of the beef and chicken. It seems as if they just stir fried a ton of onions in there to make it seem like a lot. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't something so great to be charged that much. Overall, the portion sizes were very small for a price way too high for their dishes.",

It had just enough noodles and soup. Though it would've been better if they added more brisket and steak. Gotta love that extra meat! Waiters seemed funny here probably because I couldn't fully understand their jokes but I guess it made up for the o-k service. The extra star really belonged to the desserts I tried on my recent visit. There were these ice cream balls called exotic bomba and bomba. (Filipinos, don't get any dirty ideas!) Both were actually pretty good. The exotic bomba had a fruitier taste coated with white chocolate and the bomba had a coffee taste coated with milk chocolate. Once again, I was suckered into the sweets!",

I'm sorry, but any self-respecting Vietnamese person would not serve what they serve here and call it \"pho\". The meat tasted like it had been frozen, cooked, frozen again then served to me. Foul. The noodles had a plasticky smell that was definitely off-putting.   Word to the wise. This will only be edible if you're completely smashed or hungover. Otherwise, steer clear or drive the 4 hours to Bolsa for a real bowl of pho.",

This place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off Spring Mountain and Valley View (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling).   What I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!  I always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty. Then I enjoy ordering the Mongolian beef or the Bun bo hue; a vermicelli noodle soupy have good pho according to my Vietnamese friends who always order that but I usually don't get it because I'm not in the mood for soup and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth.",

I'm no expert at being a food critic, but I honestly can't find a complaint for this place. The most amazing thing that really gets me is that the meat they put in the broth isn't even fully cooked when it's served. It cooks while the broth is still steamin' hot.   Personally, I can find myself going here over and over again. There's nothing wrong with this place at all. Except for the parking. It's a total drag during the busy hours, which is usually night time-ish. However, Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is just amazing.",

Well, when we tried the calamari came, it tasted like old grease and batter.. no seasoning at all.. and also it looked nothing like the picture. It was also served with plain tomato paste as \"dipping sauce\".. Once this was told to the waitress, her respond was \"it's okay\".. and she took the plate away. About 30 seconds later, the manager comes over in a places the plate back on our table. We politely tell him that we did not want it, so we sent it back. The he says, \"I was told that you said it doesn't look like the picture. Please tell me what's different about it.\" I responded by saying that it looked NOTHING like the picture.. however, more importantly, it did NOT taste good. He continues to press the issue stating he disagrees and wanted me to point out exactly how it was different. I again stated to him that the dish did not look AT ALL like the picture, but that wasn't the issue. The calamari did NOT taste good. Plain and simple... Then he said.. \"Well, I cannot take it back just because you don't like how the food looks.\" (Although we kept saying that it was just plain nasty). THEN he says \"You have already eaten most of it, so I cannot take it back.\" Seriously?? We had only eaten 2-3 pieces of it. I called the waitress over who agreed with me saying that the plate looked pretty much the same as it did when she brought it over.. I asked the guy, are you really trying to force me to accept this plate even though I'm telling you this is nasty? Are you guys really doing that bad??? He then responds by saying \"If you won't want to pay for the food you can leave!\" SMH... I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant in my life. I can't give a review of the restaurant as a whole since we were not allowed to have the full experience; however, I can say that this manager should be fired...",

    "text": "I must admit, I have been a lurker on yelp for several years... After years and years of experiencing a multitude of underground culinary gems to the most decadent restaurants, I've come across a restaurant that was the catalyst to my finally making an account. And hey, I have 4 hours to kill before I'm back in Cali ;-) Unfortunately, though it was an appalling experience that lead me to officially being here, it'll certainly open the floodgates to my culinary soap box for the good experiences as well :)  Anyway, I digress.. I've been to PKL several times over the years, and it truly has topped itself in the degradation of service each time. I came here with my in laws, parents, fiance, aunt and uncle, to complete our Vegas Christmas gift to them filled with cirque shows, spas, and enough slot machine pulling to make my mom grow a baby bicep. It was 830 am on Sunday, and the restaurant couldn't have been filled more than a quarter capacity. The PKL gentlemen in the front didn't even look at us and started walking us to the back where he threw a few menus down. I immediately thought it was rude, but figured he may have been having a bad morning. Moving on...   When we were seated Raymond our server stopped by to bring some glasses of water. My uncle, who was tickled to be here, asked him what the gentlemen next to our table was eating, since it looked delicious. Raymond didn't even glance at the other table, and immediately responded \"I don't know.\". So in jest my uncle says \"if you walk over a couple feet, you may have a better idea\". He tells us it's pho, walks away, and is no where to be found for the next 15 min. Finally I flag James/Jason, the older server with  spikey hair, that we're ready to order. Agitated, he walks over to collect our order. Each dish we named, he responded with disdain and contempt. My little old mommy didn't know that one of the broken rice orders came with a choice of 2 meats, and he begins yelling at her \"which one do you want?!!!? I can do double meat!!!! Just let me know!!!\". Which was totally unnecessary since she must've been confused for no more than 5 seconds. I would've walked out right there and hopped over to lee's, but a couple of the parents wanted to stay since we already ordered most of the food. Needless to say the food was delivered by the same disgruntled James/Jason. The food (pho, broken rice, clams, water spinach, tofu and pad thai) was served cold and they forgot two of the orders until we reminded them.  Annoyed that large parties get automatically charged 17% for gratuity.  Anyway, won't ever be back and suspect their sign that says \"voted best pho in Vegas\" was just something the owner thought of printing while he was on the can... Because it sure isn't True :)",

It's always very busy so I thought that was great. I always order the Pho Vegan, and it it excellent! Great flavor. The tofu nuggets are very good as well. They also serve brown rice! Which many Pho locations don't, (like the one I'm at right now) it's 24 hours which is also a plus, I was on the strip late night and wanted something light and they were my first option! Will always come back here!",

There was no one at the front desk so I couldn't even ask how long the wait would be. Finally once a large group got seated I was able to see that there was a sign in sheet. After that we waited about 10 min to be seated. Once we were seated no one seemed to want to take our order. For the amount of people there, you would think there would be more workers. We sat there for a good 10 min before anyone even came to ask us if we would like anything to drink. The only good thing was that the food came out pretty quickly. Which isn't too surprising considering it was just soup. We had the steak pho. Super good and the portion was huge. my BF and I could have literally ordered one to share. We also ordered the chicken fried rice which was really bland and didn't have a flavor at all. The pho was good enough to maybe come back But for the lack of customer service I might try a different pho spot next time.",

I had the vegan pho which was super flavorful and full of veggies and noodles. I also ordered the tofu nuggets because I wanted to be able to say that I ordered tofu nuggets with a straight face. They were actually pretty good, as was the sauce they came with. My friend ordered crab rangoon. It was the same old crab rangoon you get anywhere, but they charged $8 for it. Seriously?  The service was very hurried, and the waiter never actually took a drink order. He just brought us all water and that was that; we hadn't even realized until he left with the food order. Hurried service also meant the food came quickly, and you can't complain about that. No asking for dessert either. The check just came when he decided to bring it. So it goes.  Also, for some reason that we couldn't figure out, there was house music playing in the background the whole time. It wasn't annoying. Just confusing. We just chalked it up to being Vegas after midnight.",

As she's calling names she sounds so bothered. Anyways we order wonton egg noodle, steamed rice and orange chicken with calamari. First the guy came with calamari and orange chicken and basically threw it on the table and left so fast that we couldn't even ask him for the condiments or our rice. So 5 min pass and everyone there is so good at not giving you eye contact so they don't have to walk over to you. Finally someone came and we asked for our condiments. My soup finally came and the egg noodles were overcooked  it was mushy and it felt gross. It took another 4 min to flag someone down and another 10 to replace my soup which still had over cooked noodles. Worst service ever!",

    "text": "I really wish I didn't have to write this review. But if I don't share this experience, I'm not being True to my Yelp self or my fellow Yelpers out there. Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever.   It all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world.  However, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot.   15 minutes...20 minutes go by. 25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out.  I FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling.  My beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a... COCKROACH.   I stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.  I'm done.",

The pad Thai was good (beef was delicious) but it had a little too much sauce. Fairly decent prices, a lot of different dishes to choose from, parking lot sucks, decor is nice and unexpected from how the outside looks, and they keep it really cold in there too.

I ended up receiving my to go order and left because I was disgusted about the way everything was. I get home to find out they screwed my to go order up....besides the horrible service, the decor was okay, they should get remodeled due to the scuffed tables, walls and chairs to the chairs cushions being torn, the bathrooms being utterly disgusting and to the fish tanks that have maybe 1-2 fish max in there.

The Pho broth is nice and tastey, not overly salty and not overly oily, and which you can find at alot of other places.   The major downfall of this place is the horrible service... you really can't call it service at all... We were ignored for a good 12-15min before a manager came over and just said \"what do you want\". The plus side is the food comes out quickly and the tables turn fast so you don't have to wait long... but you really don't expect good service in a place like this i guess.

And I hate to say it but, while they will help you (after asking them for something 3 times before they do it), unless you're Asian, don't expect to be waited on promptly.   Their food is amazing and the Salt & Pepper Calamari is the BOMB!",

Let me just say they had very long chop sticks, LOL!!!! =P   Everytime I'm in Vegas, I have to eat here especially if I'm with friends. For some reason they never believe you when you tell them where you what to eat.   The Pho is actually pretty good along with the spring rolls and egg rolls. If your tired of all the buffets on the strip or your looking for a cheap place to eat, just head over to China town.",

We ordered the peppered filet mignon and the braised fish in the clay pot (ca kho and bo luc lac for the vietnamese peeps) Both were really flavorful! The steak was tender and juicy. The fish was a yummy balance of sweet and savory, definitely recommend! One star off bc i thought they used way too much ground pepper.  It was clean and crowded for a Tuesday night and we had great service.I will be back for the pho in the near future!!",

I have brought a dozen people both local and visitors who have never been there before and they all come back with or without me. Couple of times I had lunch and dinner there on the same day with different guests and never get tired of the food. I highly recommend chicken pho and chicken bun. Don't eat pork please- it's not good for you!",

I'm not one to get fancy with pho, so I usually go with pho tai or pho tai chin.  A bit of hot sauces mixed up for dipping the meat, and I'm happy.  The egg rolls are served nuclear hot, and unlike a lot of other places, appear to be home-made... at least ours always appear that way, from their non-uniform shapes and funky bulges.  Oh, and they're tasty, too.  A bowl of pho runs you around $7 with a large being $1 more.  This is expensive for pho compared to places in L.A., but is about the norm for Pho here in Vegas.  It's one of our default go-to suggestions when we're hungry and cruising up Spring Mountain.",

But here's what I make of the place:  Not too bad...was this placed called something else prior to being Pho Kim Long? I know we came here ages ago (my family and I) and I was sorely disappointed back then. This time around it wasn't too bad and it was actually quite good. The only problem was it was quite pricy for a bowl of Pho. I think it was 7 or 8 dollars for a average sized bowl. Trust me, coming from San Jose, CA you have places with an XL bowl costing you only 4 to 5 bucks.   Overall, I give them 3/3.5 out of 5. It was better then before, food was YUM-O, and service was eh, and the atmosphere was also EH. Enjoy!",

The restaurant is located in the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain.  It does get very crowded and busy during lunch hours and parking can be tough sometimes.  Expect a wait when you come during lunch hours.  They have a full menu of dishes, including rice, bun, and chow fun.  But I always order pho every time I come.  The broth is tasty and super hot (just the way I like it).  The service can sometimes be slow or lacking because they are so busy.  They do take the major credit cards, including Mastercard, Visa, and Discover, but NOT American Express.  Anyways, when we are in Vegas and need our Pho fix, this is the place I like to go.",

So my brothers and my boyfriend were already waiting at the table before my mom and I sat down, the waiter come seconds after we picked up the menu. My mother had questions about a noodle dish.. Yet he told my mom on Vietnamese \"if you are not ready to order yet, don't call me over.\" thing is, we didn't call him over! He was rushing my mom when he could have kindly told us he'd give us a minute to come back. I know that vietnamese restaurants usually have shiet service but the waiters attitude was intolerable. Anyway, The pho was bleh, it was a light soup that had way too much star anise it was okay to me,.. I expected more since this restaurant had a buncha ppl waiting in line for the food. My mi xao had waaaaay too much starch in it.. It tasted like day old Chinese food that's been heated up.. The gravy was sooo hot... The last thing that bothered me was the smell.. We sat on the back near the restroom/kitchen.. It stuck so bad! They needa cover that wall or clean their restroom.. The smell was so disgustingly nasty.. I can't even explain to yu. Sigh* my family and I shoulda walked out but my brother already pre ordered calamari.",
