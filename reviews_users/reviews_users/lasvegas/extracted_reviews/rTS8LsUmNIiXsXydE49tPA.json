After waiting a good while i was starving! when the food came the meat was real fatty and chewy and not alot of flavor. I never send food back but in this case i had to and not to mention it wasn't very hot. By the time my waitress figured everything out w/ her manager my best friend was all ready done w/ her plate of food (coconut prawns that were delicious to be fair). I will eat here again i do believe i just had a miss instead of a hit.",

    "text": "Always a good time!  Since I was last here in April, it seems like maybe the menu has changed because I didn't previously notice that they had many vegetarian options.  This time around, they had several veg-friendly options and even had marked on the menu which items could be made vegetarian.  Kudos on that.  However, I had a chicken salad minus the chicken and was charged the same price... not a huge issue but surely the chicken would have been more costly than the lettuce, sugared pecans, and mango?  In any case, the food here is always good and I love the nautical ambiance.  Service was on par the Monday evening I visited and there was no wait for a table.  The outdoor dining space is excellent as well with a fun view of the strip.  My only issue with Margaritaville is that it is always freezing cold!  I almost always prefer to eat outside when possible since I won't be shivering throughout my meal!",

Service was nice and friendly, and our waitress did a great job keeping tabs on our group of 11 and managed to get all our orders right.   Food was good but not great - my turkey burger with mushrooms and cheese was solid but nothing to write home about.   Portions were pretty good-sized though, and I didn't finish my food.

Way too much, and the people sitting next to us felt the same way!!  I wanted to suggest that he take it down a few notches, but opted to just let it go.  He certainly is not a company asset.

The atmosphere here is one that is slightly different than the one right out the doors. The bar/restaurant makes you feel as if the ocean of your choice is 30 yards right behind you. The TRANQUIL WATERS boat drink is one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. The mangoes are cut small enough to go through the straw to give the cocktail a little texture. Great drink accompanying the always perfectly flavored Clipper Wings. All around great experience!",

    "text": "Provided you're at least a casual Jimmy Buffett fan, this restaurant is fun. One of the cheaper meals out I had on the strip. The food was quite good, and the service was more than adequate. The atmosphere is clearly what makes or breaks this restaurant for most people.  The giant volcano over the main bar of course pales in comparison to the one in front of the Mirage just down the street, but it's purposefully more kitschy and fun. There's a giant \"Booze in the Blender\" that slowly fills up over an hour and when it does, the \"Volcano blows.\" Most of the floor is decorated to look like you're in open water and several of the tables are decorated like skiffs. We were seated close to the bar on the main 'ship' section of the restaurant. There were several \"Postcards from the Road\" screens showing a combination of Jimmy Buffett videos and other music from his Sirius XM station. I don't follow Buffett personally but have always been a casual fan. His style of music is fitting for the very very casual atmosphere of the restaurant.  Just like most musician-themed bar/restaurants, most of the items on the menu are named after forced puns on Buffett songs. This seems to work a little better with Buffett since he actually already has both his own beer and margarita line and songs about food.  I was tempted to get the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" but instead went with the \"Volcano Burger.\" It had chili and cheese sauce and avocado and Fritos and jalapenos and it was a little overwhelming. The burger kind of fell apart when I tried to eat it. Nevertheless it was tasty and cooked to my liking. The bun was a little dry but not too bad. We went in the afternoon for lunch and did not have to wait long. The burger may have benefited from having the bun scooped out to leave more room for all of the toppings. On the bright side, I had plenty of chili/meat salad to eat after I was finished with my burger from all the toppings that fell off.  Long story short: Margaritaville is not about the food. It's clearly about spending some time wishing you could ever be as relaxed and carefree as Jimmy Buffett himself. The atmosphere is nice and the food is fine. If you're a Buffett fan you'll have the time of your life, as long as you don't blow out your flip flop.",

There was also a lady there who was suppose to seat us but before she wanted to do so she had to put lotion on her hands that she grabbed from her purse. YES ladies and gentlemen we watched her rub her hands with lotion for a good minute!!!!! At this time we said \"screw this!\". We walked out.....then I thought I will talk with the manager. I told her the whole story. About Camile and this other dud of an employee. I was told it happens to be a lot of issues with the host stand.

Just awful!  Also worst service I've had anywhere. The waiter didn't feel like I'd tipped him enough I guess because he brought my check back after I paid,  slapped it in front of me, and said \"There's a tipping guide at the bottom!\". What? !?  Will never never eat here again. And as a Jimmy Buffett fan it saddens me that is name is in this place.",

A waiter walked away from me after asking him if I can sit in a booth because I had my grandmother who walks with a cane with me and he said no we only have high-top seating available. He told me he couldn't help me so I asked to speak to the manager and I while I was explaining my situation to the manager, he interrupts and tells the manager that's not what happened, acting very belligerent and he's a liar because he knows good and got damn well he said, \"I can't help you\" and started walking away. The manager Keisha, I believe that was her name, helped us and was able to get a regular table. During our meal, I saw the same waiter telling his coworkers what happened and he was talking ish and that is very unprofessional.  The food was mediocre. We had the shrimp & grits and crab cake sandwich that was overcooked. Bad first time experience.",

As it got dark, we could see lots of lights and the Bellagio fountains during some parts of that show.    WARNING:  The kids meals are enormous.  We easily could've fed all 3 kids with one meal.

We ended up splitting the bowl of Mac since neither of us were too hungry...it didn't look like much, but the sauce was super rich (very tasty) and made the dish very filling. This was probably one of the best bowls of mac & cheese I've ever had, and I was sad I couldn't stuff the whole thing in my face.   I gotta say, I loved the decor...kinda cheesy, but really fun. As a closet country fan, I loved the crap out of the music videos they projected on the wall.   AND: the best part of our experience...our server Beth B. kicked ass. She was really attentive, very patient in answering all our questions and making sure we had everything we needed, and made us feel really welcome even though I felt like a total cheapskate for paying with a voucher. But we'll definitely be back next time to spend some real money :D",

Sat and watched as all the tables around us came in, sat after us and got their food way before us.

My besties and I went here recently on a girl's trip and we had a great experience. Our waitress had excellent customer service skills and she was very efficient. Our drinks were never empty, when we asked what she recommended she was very thorough and down to earth.   Most of my friends had the fish tacos and they loved it. One of my friends had the buttermilk fried chicken and she loved it.  I had their signature fish sandwich. I think the fish that night was cod but whatever the case, it was delicious.  Another thing about Margaritaville that we loved was the atmosphere. We left shortly after a band started to play.  I wanted to stay but we had to go. They had a big dance floor and the next time we go there, I'm hoping we stay for the band and dance. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is that their drinks area bit overpriced. I understand that it is on the Vegas strip and I do agree with some of the other reviewers saying it is a tourist trap. Since I've been to this restaurant before, I just ordered an iced tea while the others ordered drinks. I already have my margarita blender cup from my last trip there and I wish that they would make their margaritas a bit stronger but that's my own opinion.",

The place is loud, music videos always playing on the big screen, most of which are live performances by Jimmy Buffett in his Bermuda shorts and flip-flops, and it can be difficult to have a conversation. We had to holler our order at the server. At one point in the evening, we were all interrupted to watch a blonde chick in a pink bikini ride down a water slide into a giant cocktail glass which was followed by a short dance routine by people in costumes on stilts telling us to put our hands in the air. Seriously. When I'm at a restaurant, I don't want to put my hands in the air, I want to eat and be left alone.  Which reminds me, they serve food too. I had the sirloin steak which was disappointing. It was really thin and kind of tasteless. It was about as thick as a slice of toast. Not worth the $22. It was like something that would come in a TV dinner. I'm probably spoiled living in western Canada with all of our great Alberta beef. Yum. Shortly after the meal, my stomach felt upset. Could be a coincidence.  We just wanted to get out of there after our meal. I felt like we were intruding on some secret society or cult and I just wanted to give them back their privacy. I'm giving Margaritaville two stars for the food and four stars for the decor. They really are unique, I'll give them that. Not my kind of place.",

    "text": "First actual place on our drinking tour (post bachelorette party) of the Boulevard was Margaritaville.  We had originally wanted to sit at one of the bars, but apparently Sunday afternoons while football is on and it's beautiful outside makes for a hard time to get two spots.   So we got classic margaritas from the small to-go bar, and wandered on our way. It was easy, fresh, quick, and the bartenders were super nice and non-Las Vegasy.   We chatted in line with a big dude who was talking football and making our drinks extra special. Why hate on the tourist trap (because that's what the restaurant really is), when the tender pours an extra shot in each drink. Sign me up.",

    "text": "Ok, so I feel I am being a tad bit generous with the 2 stars...anyways here goes...  I feel my review is pretty valuable as I have dined at this restaurant once last year and once this year.   Was not impressed the first visit in 2010 as I had high hopes. Was really hoping the whole \"Cheeseburger in paradise\" thing would be something real and not just a mirage.   The location is great, business is always booming which they owe to the Tourist big time, and Flamingo hotel and casino as well since they have a direct corridor to access the restaurant. I thank you myself Flamingo for parking :)  Heads up...this place is ALWAYS busy from opening til closing so if you are looking for a peaceful sanctuary for a first date or some under the table romance, uh uh ain't happening, simply not an option here!  First visit- Busy, service was very bad this particular day, the waitress as I call these \"types\" was a threesome, and not the good kind either. Meaning 3 visits to our table, 1. take order, 2 drop food, 3 drop check. Not the service you expect and deserve when dining out. When you are forced to flag down other waiters and bussers to get a refill, it's just bad. Food was overpriced and mediocre at best! Burger, dry, flavorless, bun was hard as if had been sitting in the sun for a bit. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich which was dry, overcooked, another bad hard crusty bun. The fries, not impressive, won't even say what they tasted like or had the consistency of. Bad fries, come on, no excuse.   Second visit- Margaritas good yes considering that is the name of this establishment. Food again, bad, this time my meal was cold and I am not talking about my tossed salad either. I decided to order the salmon this time, ok did not have a good experience with the burger last time let's try seafood... I left just as hungry as when I had walked in the door also. Ugh, bland food and again bad service another threesome waitress, wtf? Is this policy? I give up, another large bill paid after being bent over and stuffed with a whole giant frozen pickle.   Never again...I am beyond dissapointed...the feeling of leaving unsatisfied is simply cruel.  The atmosphere and drinks are cool...the food and service...not so much!",

I thought it would be a great idea to sit out on one of those decks forgetting that Vegas is hot in June.  Don't be tempted by the bright lights of Vegas if you are eating here for lunch.  You might suffer third degree burns.    On the more positive side, the food was great.  My wife and I were looking for slightly more healthy options after having enjoyed a buffet the night before.  We ordered a chicken sandwich and grilled chicken salad.  Both were great, especially the salad.  We even dipped our sandwich in the salad dressing.  Food prices are average for Vegas (which means higher than the rest of the world).  Our server was fantastic.  Just a genuinely nice guy who spent time chatting with us about our trip.    I might just become a Parrot Head yet...",

    "text": "We were staying at the Flamingo for my mom's 55th birthday so we decided to eat here for dinner. I called ahead earlier in the day to make an 8:15 reservation and mentioned the event we were celebrating. When we arrived there was no record of our reservation and we were told we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table. I showed the outgoing call on my phone to prove I had called ahead and I asked if there was anything they could do. After 10 minutes the hostess agreed to seat us and apologized for the confusion.  Okay fine.  We were seated and greeted by our server, Jennifer, who took our drink orders but did not bring them to us for 20 minutes- when she did she spilled some of them on my parents laps.  I get that these things happen but it just the combination of events just came off to us as sloppy.  I could see if it were super busy but surprisingly for a Saturday night it was not.  What we did observe instead was Jennifer chatting with her co-workers for several minutes at a time.  What's more, she did not take our order for another 10 minutes bringing our drinks despite letting her know we were ready.  I had hoped the food would be worth the wait to compensate for the subpar service but it was not.  The coconut shrimp breading was thick and undercooked and my green beans were cold but after waiting so long  I ate it anyway instead of sending it back.  I'm glad other people have had a great time here but I cannot say the same.  The best thing I had was my $32 pina colada in the blender souvenir cup.",

The gift shop is annoying as you'll only find Jimmy Buffett stuff, don't understand why people like him, he had one good song and can't sing worth a hoot. Would rather listen to the Marcarena all day long. So just be prepared to tune the music out and the big screen promo of him that plays non stop while you are there.  Have tried the cheeseburger and the blackened fish at this location in particular. Both very very good. But for an appetizer you need to get the nachos! Awesome! Very fattening and bad for you, so make sure it's a cheat meal for you :) Service is awesome, both times we had Chris. Ask for him and you won't be disappointed. He even gave us a tour of the place. There's 3 levels. And this one location is according to him the busiest restaurant in the U.S, maybe the world I can't remember.  Food is well priced. Give it a try",

This place always has a fun atmosphere whether it be for a quick drink (The Pink Cadillac is delicious) at the wrap around bar or grabbing a table late night by the stage where there is a live band, either one is a good time! Of course if you're a huge Jimmy Buffet fan there are plenty of souvenirs in the gift shop that you have to walk through to get to the bar. I almost got suckered into something because it's all such fun stuff. The food menu was quite large and the pulled pork burger was amazing!!! The bun was loaded with so much pork you would barley see it. We sat at the bar so the service was great, friendly and fast bar tenders. Oh, and try to count how many times they play \"it's 5 o'clock somewhere\"  haha those poor bar tenders!",

We also bought the 100 Oz. margarita mix for $50. *TIP* If you get it, tell them to put LESS ice. They put so much that it dilutes your drink quickly.  The shrimp/steak was very dry. I highly recommend that you don't order it and stick to nachos + burgers.   One thing that's great about Margaritaville are the balloon makers. They make awesome balloon designs for your party/kids - an awesome experience. They have a show where a girl slides down the volcano - it's rather dumb, but better than nothing I guess.",

Huge shout out to Pam who was our waitress on the last night. She was amazing!! Participated in our oddball conversation, never had to wait for service, and funny as all get out. Can't beat it!!

I've been craving steak and eggs so I wanted to eat somewhere where it wouldn't break the bank. Margaritaville ticked the box for affordable steak and eggs on the strip for only $25. It was only a 7 minute walk from my hotel l, Caesar's Palace.   It's connected right into the Flamingo hotel. So you don't have to walk on the sidewalk from the Flamingo rather just walk through the casino towards the gift shop and into the main restaurant.   No wait!   I went straight for the bar and ordered what I wanted. There's nothing great about the food here other than enjoying the Margaritaville  ambiance. The bartender was quick to take my order and it only took 15 minutes for my food to arrive.   Luckily I was able to charge it to the room and earn some Tier credits. For sure, next time I want to try the Volcano Nachos on the upper deck of the restaurant with a 5 O' Clock somewhere cocktail. Mmmm.....",

One of the servers who helped my table out didn't even jot down our large order. She remembered everything off the top of her head and brought it out correctly. Impressive! The bartenders also make it an awesome and fun vibe to be around in.   **TIP FOR MY FELLOW PARTY ANIMALS**  You cannot leave Vegas and call it a good weekend without trying their mouth watering nachos. Even if you can't find someone to share them with, screw it ! Get an order all for yourself. I did so and of course couldn't finish the massive amount but don't let that stop you. ;)",

    "text": "Margaritaville was crowded, loud, and SUPER touristy.  Located on the Strip, this is a convenient restaurant to grab lunch at during the day with a group of any size (families welcome), but not a dining destination I would seek out in Vegas.  We sat in the bar and the staff was nice, but not super friendly - happy to serve you their favorite margarita, but not excited to serve you a glass of water with it.  Other than that, no issues with the service.  The drink menu is obviously focused on margs, so don't try to think too much out of the box.  The regular margarita on the rocks was good, so we did have two rounds, but I don't know we would go for another one during lunch (i.e., order your next marg when you are about halfway through the previous one if you are really visiting Margaritaville to live it up).  The flavored margs sounded good - but those who tried them ended up being jealous of everyone drinking \"boring\" margaritas.  The food menu is the same at the bar as in the restaurant, but wait times on food seemed to be a little longer in the dining room than at the bar (pretty common during lunch hours at busy places on the Strip).  Items on the menu were nothing fancy and we generally had no complaints about the quality, but nothing really stood out to us.  Price-wise, this is not a bad option for good food at a not absolutely terrible price (in Vegas terms), and considering its location, it's a prime location for groups staying at different hotels to meet up.  Overall, it's fine.  I like Margaritaville, but it's not my final destination in Vegas. Cheers!",

My husband ordered sparkling water, our friend ordered ice tea. When she returned, my friend asked for sugar, and she became upset saying she already asked me if I wanted sugar and I said no. I wasn't speaking for the table, and I ordered first. My friend apologized saying she didn't hear because of the music. She brought sugar back and was annoyed. She refilled my husband's water with Sprite. He cannot drink soda due to health issues. We could not get her attention to get the drink replaced, so he got up and approached her where she was standing. He shared that she seemed put out. I reflected the bad service via the tip. 15% vs 20% I would normally give. The whole experience left a very bad impression.  We spent a substantial amount of money to be treated pretty poorly.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch as a family with young kids the other day based on the recommendation of some friends that this is a fun place for the children. Seemed a little odd to me, but hey, why not?  Parking is available via the Flamingo Hotel and Vegas locals can still park for free for 24 hours. Yay!  It's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, through the casino from the parking garage to Margaritaville.   We were able to be seated pretty quickly since the restaurant wasn't too busy for the lunch service. Our server was Susanna. She came by and plopped some menus on the table. Literally, a few minutes later, she came back and asked if we had drink orders ready. Since we barely had time to pick up the menu to look at it, we asked that she come back in a few. She walked away for one minute and then came right back. So we rushed to give her some drink orders.   As we sat there trying to check out the kids menu and the regular menu, she appears again. This time she seemed rush to take our food order. If you have young kids, you know it requires a bit of patience to get everyone situated. Most of the party had decided on what to eat, but my young daughter still hadn't. So we started giving her the orders. Susanna seemed like we were wasting her time because she had to pause for 30 seconds while my daughter finally came to a decision. I'm not really sure why there was such a rush when the whole place wasn't that busy. But we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing her. Needless to say, our service experience was pretty crappy. Even after having a chat with the manager, not much changed.  There is not separate menu for lunch, which means the prices amount to the high Strip prices for dinner. At least there is a kids menu. An entree will run you from $15-20.   The food really wasn't that fabulous for the prices. Pretty average. We had the crab/artichoke dip which was tasty. Fish and chips were average. Jr. Cheeseburger pretty large for a kid. Crab cakes tasted like they were frozen and pretty mushy.   If anything, you're paying for the atmosphere of this place. It looked like there was a large stage in the dining area for live music, which was not utilized during the lunch service. The music is playing so loud inside the restaurant that it's hard to have a conversation with anyone at your table.   So if you're looking for a place to drink cocktails and party, this might be a better fit. If you're looking for a good meal, this probably isn't the place, at least based on our experience.",

    "text": "Came here on our last day of a bachelorette vacation and I'm not ashamed to admit that we were looking for someplace cheap but delicious because our wallets were feeling the sting of Vegas.  First, the decor outside with the palm trees was surprisingly inviting and the surprise on our faces only got bigger once we stepped indoors. Inside Margaritaville are tables on boats, a volcano, large sea animals on the ceiling and way more intricate details to make it seem like you are surrounded by beautiful things on an island or tropical paradise. And we didn't expect the food to be great at all, but boy were we wrong!  Everything that was ordered was incredible. The main thing everyone should try here is the volcano nachos!! There are some great apps on the menu (we tried several) and also the drinks are just fabulous.  But the main reason everyone needs to come here is the entertainment! We absolutely got a kick out of the people walking around on stilts and making balloon animals! We had one of them come over and make our bachelorette a crown with two hearts intertwined and tipped him $5 for his time. Everyone is so unbelievably friendly and the best part?! The show!! So sometime when you are eating, everyone who works there starts singing and dancing and up goes a chick onto the volcano, (near the celling!) comes down a slide and into a huge water tank! It was completely entertaining to watch for those of all ages! And I would definitely go back in a heartbeat!  Don't miss this place on your list of things to do in Vegas! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "The 5 'O clock Somehwere Bar inside Margaritaville is hands down THE best place to drink on the strip during the hours of 5-7pm every. single. day. You'll be hard pressed to find deals this good. They have $1 vodka shots, $5 classic margaritas, and some chick is walking around with $3 Jello shots! I've gone with friends twice and everyone always has a great time. The atmosphere is perfect too-- it's fun, loud, but also has a sense of being a little more laid back than the strip. The bartenders are hilarious, talented (they do tricks!) but extremely attentive and make sure you're never left trying to wave them down. It's like a vacation within vacation. The actual casino part of Margaritaville is also really neat. It's less crowded than the main floor and again, just a very chill vibe. There's also beer pong which makes for a fun activity to get the night started. Just to clarify: this happy hour is restricted to the bar that's RIGHT off the gambling floor, not inside of the restaurant. Also to note: they don't serve food at this bar, but they do at the one inside the restaurant. So typically we'll drink during happy hour, then move inside for some Volcano Nachos (amazing, meatless, but big enough to share with 2-4 HUNGRY people!)",

Nachos very big. Kind of canned chili tasting. Fish and chips good except for slaw. Overpowering cilantro taste. Fries just fries. Jalapeno tartar sauce good. With so many choices will probably go somewhere else next time.",

My sister recommended Margaritaville as a fun place to do a birthday celebration as it's done well - singing, balloons, hats! Not to mention that we were told that it was, in general, a festive place to eat as an experience- music and interaction among patrons & with staff. But no such thing! It was a boring, ordinary meal at a chain restaurant.   On the celebration scale, it failed miserably. Even tho our waitress was notified right away, she had to be reminded and then only brought a dish of ice cream with an obligatory birthday wish.  Ughh!! - what a disappointment when you're expecting so much more. Certainly, don't celebrate anything here!",

Hostess \"10 to 15 minutes as handing over a buzzer. no greeting, no smile, nothing other than that. Okay then Well, I guess we are waiting.    The server was quite good actually. Prompt and nice enough. Just the food brought it back down. Quickly, do not try the great sounding Avocado/Boursin omelet. It is nasty. The eggs seemed and tasted like powdered. Way too much Boursin (Maybe to hide the eggs:) A wee bit of avocado.  We both had hash browns, I got about 1/4 cup serving if that and he got at least a cup worth. Very inconsistent. We asked for both crispy. His were not in the least, most were not even somewhat browned just a heap of undercooked white strips and mine were mostly burnt. Burned is not what crispy means lol. Usually, I'll try a place twice, because everyone and place can have a bad day... there were just too many strikes and there are just too many options in Vegas. Not again.",

My husband and I total was 34 and change, my friend was 28 and change and my sis was 48 and change. We didn't really pay too much attention we were tired and wanted to go home. Her service wasnt that great and the food wasn't either. My sis called me today and told me she charged the whole 108 to my bro in laws card, so she basically pocketed our cash as a tip. She probably thought we were tourists and I wouldn't be surprised if she does it all the time. So be weary when you go out to eat on the strip and you get separate checks!!",

The burger was extremely bland as were the fries, and pretty costly considering there are a million other restaurants just seconds away.

I like Jimmy Buffet and I live in New Orleans where we also have a Margaritaville but the food at the New Orleans location is exponentially better than this place even though it still isn't that great.  The shrimp here were horrible with the texture of gummy bears and I've never experienced such atrocious seafood.  The food was all bland and even \"spicy\" dishes had no flavor!  I'm really confused why they can't seem to do drinks and food at least on par with the similarly themed but far better executed Bahama Breeze chain that isn't that far a ride from here (tip: go there if you're in the mood for a tropical themed restaurant and you will be FAR happier). The big bonus is you can get wasted away again in Margaritaville on margaritas here but the bad news is they aren't that great here and I wish they had prickly pear flavored ones like the Z'Tejas chain does. I know this is the most profitable restaurant in America so please Jimmy get some quality control on the food going through here!  A good Gulf Coast boy like Mr. Buffet needs to be embarrassed to have served food like this even if he is laughing all the way to the bank.",

They have staff on stilts and the music is obnoxious. That being said, the food isn't bad. Seafood mac and cheese is killer, and who ,does not like a shot of tequila or five? If you don't mi d a circus like atmosphere, drunk touristas, and aren't scared of balloons give it a try. Tell em Jimmy sent you!",

They have a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar), mostly centered around margaritas; it is, afterall, in their name. If you want their strongest drink, get the Perfect Margarita (gold tequila, silver tequila, triple sec, orange curacao and lime juice on the rocks. I can't say it tasted very good because, well, it didn't; but it did its job.  I may have been drunk after an additional shot of grey goose, but I'm calling BS on this extra tax they charged us. The sales tax in Vegas is 8.1%, but they charged us 18.1%. I knew something wasn't right when the tax they charged was higher than the amount listed next to the suggested 15% tip amount. When I asked our server about it, he said all places in Vegas charge an extra 10% tax at places where they have entertainment. That's the first time I've ever heard about something like that. What BS! I won't be coming back.",

The food and drinks can be a bit expensive.   The marquee item on the menu is the Volcano Nachos. It satisfied our table of six adults. The burgers are a pretty safe bet here. Drinks are pretty good here, but be careful how much you drink, because they add up.   I really like the atmosphere here. I'm no die hard Parrot Head, but I appreciate Jimmy Buffett and it is neat seeing how this guy lives and the happiness he brings people. They seem to play more of his stuff for dinner than lunch.",

Kids ordered bacon cheese burger something like $16, it better be a damn good burger.  Rally's is way, way, way, better and I think, bigger.  Fries were droopy and tasteless. I ordered a salad with shrimp, thinking I would get a salad with shrimp.  What I got was a head of iceberg lettuce the size of my fist, spit into 4ths with 2 grape tomatoes and 2 slices of cucumber, dressing and 6 very tasty shrimp.  This too was priced about $18.00  A side salad was bigger and only around 4 bucks.  Jambalaya was good, have to admit that.  Hubby's.  Table mate had to send his steak in 3 times, at about 20 minutes each time to get it medium well- came bloody rare 3 times.  Finally, he just asked for it to be made well done, and when they finally got it to him it looked like a fine pair of moccasins.  I dearly hope he didn't have to pay for that, but by then it was 10pm and we were tired and leaving.",

After a adventurous night from before, my girls and I decided to take a stroll down the strip and grab a hearty breakfast to soak up all the alcohol consumed. We decided to stop by Margaritaville since I've always wanted to try this place out.  Although it was an hour wait, we didn't mind since our poor feet needed a rest from the high heels we wore the other night.   We ordered the huge nachos, buffalo wings and to be healthy, the Asian salad and of course, a side of strawberry margarita.  All this, was able to feed 3 starving girls. We even had left overs to take back. The strawberry margarita and nachos totally hit the spot! I was in complete heaven! The salad helped wash down all the greasy fried goodness.    I can't wait to go back and try all the other items on the menu. I haven't found a margarita as good as this place yet!",

Everything else was very average-tasting Mexican/American food, though the portions were sufficiently large and filling. Do NOT get the fish and chips, might be the worst fish and chips I've ever had. It looks and tastes more like a giant chicken nugget.  On the plus side, there are people walking around with stilts which are very entertaining. Also, once in a while this girl dressed up as a mermaid dances in a volcano and does a sort of pole dance in a giant blender. So +.5 stars for entertainment, though I would still round down to 2.",

If you do come here, the one thing you SHOULD order is the nachos.  This will feed a family!  It comes out in a huge tower and it really is hard to miss when the waiters bring out the platter of nachos.  They are generous with the jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream and cheese; which is why it is so worth getting!  Andrew D. and I both ordered burgers, but sadly they were not as good.  I ordered the portobello mushroom cheeseburger and he ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger.  His burger actually tasted better than mine.  Bacon always makes things better, doesn't it?  My portobello cheeseburger was kind of lacking taste.   Already filled from alcohol from the night before, we also didn't get a chance to order a margarita.  However, their margarita menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of crazy drinks you can order.  Service was a little too slow for me, but the waitress was really nice.  For 2 people, it will cost you around $50.  A little on the pricey side for just nachos and burgers.  However, I may come back again for just the nachos.",

When I was there they had people on stilts all dressed up come trough. And I'm not sure if this really happened or not but some chick went down a water slide on top of the bar and into one of the giant decor blenders... Maybe I had too many margaritas.

    "text": "Well, last week my Vegas bucket list contained the simple (yet somehow elusive, for me) task of going to JB's Margaritaville and having a margarita (I love margaritas and have had my share). I can half-way cross this off, but not really.   After a long night, I was dying. Ya know, that \"Vegas-did-you-well\" kind of dying. But whatever, we had to power through. Our party of 6 was determined to go to M-ville, and that we did. On a Wednesday afternoon, we walked over from Cosmo and strolled into here from the sewer-smelling hell known as the Flamingo casino. We were seated right away, and seen right away.   TIPPITY-TIP-TIP: Request Ryan L. as your waiter! Seriously, this guy is the only reason that I am giving ANY stars (the food was HORRIBLE, as I will get into a little later). Management, if you read this, please recognize Ryan. He was nothing short of fantastic! He would probably remember our table, we were probably his only entertainment for the day.  Everyone at the table was going to get a margarita (except me, I cringed at the thought), and he recommended that by the time they all got the specialty margaritas, it would be about the same price as their \"Tower of Margaritas:\" a tap-operated, 5-foot tall tube loaded with ice and their traditional margarita that would serve everyone 2 margaritas...of course my friends opted for that. Not only this, but he brought out a few flavors when two of my friends didn't like the taste of the regular margarita.   For food, we all know I needed food. Something. The only redemption was the fact that the corn soup I ordered was brought out right away. This dish just didn't taste that great, but I still knew I needed to eat it. So I did.   However, when all the main dishes came out, I had just ordered the boneless buffalo wings. How hard is this? Really? These came out and it was like they had them frozen, but then the kitchen had them being cooked in the microwave for the entire duration since when Jimmy Buffet was born. I have never had more dry, tasteless, disgusting chicken in my entire life. I could barely chew it-- not to mention that they were room temperature. I ate about maybe 2-3 out of 12 and let the rest sit there. Absolutely pathetic. The rest of our party ended up with nachos-- a massive heap of tortilla chips with room temperature toppings that tasted old. Shame on you, Margaritaville.   And, enter Ryan to the rescue (kind of). We didn't want to complain-- we had places to go-- but he craftily split everything at the table on the checks before we even asked; he split the massive margarita into 6, the nachos into 3, a last-minute pitcher of margz into 2, and another entree into 2 or 3. So easy.   As miserable as I felt, I felt somewhat better towards the end (thank you, soup and water). So, I forced myself to have at least two drinks of the margarita. Unfortunately, I was once again not impressed. Sigh.   Bottom Line: Three stars for service. Negative 1 for food. Gross.",

    "text": "Wasted away...in Margaritaville.  Was searchin' for a good time and all I found was drunk folk!  Some people claim there is Sin City to blame, but I know...it was all Jimmy Buffett's fault!  TOURIST.  TRAP.  In the middle of the desert.  Mr. Buffett, you have no shame!  But this lack of shame (and the act of being high & lazy most of the time) has made you a very rich man.  You're rich, B!+ch!  Your tropical concoction of a so-called restaurant called Margaritaville is definitely to blame.  You and Kenny Chesney doing a duet anytime soon?  I will be sure to rock my big-rimmed cowboy hat, a tight tank-top, Bermuda shorts, some sandals, and my ukulele.  I want in on some of that moolah you make by pandering to your beloved 'Parrot Heads'.  Seriously, Margaritaville is like the tropics gone loco!  It's like Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame crash landed on a deserted island run by...um...Jimmy Buffett.  Damn, couldn't find a better metaphor!  This place is like a mish-mash of tropical and kitsch all rolled into one!  It's akin to being in on one of Jimmy's LSD induced hallucinations.  Although thinking about it, that might have been the goal.  Margaritaville is probably the place you want to be if you love island living (I'm from Maui but geez this is stretching it), think that all island-dwellers wear brightly colored Aloha shirts all times of the day (most of us actually run around shirtless with spears and use ti leaves as cloth diapers), and have no sense of time (actually, most of us Filipinos don't have a sense of time).  Also, if you love the song 'Margaritaville' you will probably love hanging out at Margaritaville.  I swear, for the hour we were there eating dinner, we heard the song play at LEAST 5 times!  Insane!  And yes, each time there was a bikini-clad woman sliding down a gigantic margarita glass-shaped slide into a pool below.  Drunk, frisky men were in awe (I might have been a little bit in awe as well but that was out of respect for the bikini-clad woman...a real gentleman gives credit where credit is due).  Margaritaville was quite the experience.  Upon being greeted at the host stand, we were showed to another host stand downstairs.  Now for me, this is where the night started.  It is normal to be greeted by an African-American teen, sure.  But being greeted by an African-American teen with, \"Yo dawg, how you doin'?  Four?  Right this way.\" while dressed in khaki shorts, a bright turquoise Aloha shirt with parrots on it, and sporting a bit of a gangsta lean?  Kinda hilarious.  It was a bit like being shown to your table by one of the members of the Wu Tang Clan.  In the middle of the tropics.  But hey, who am I to judge?  A kid's gotta eat.  However, we literally were sat right in the middle of the entire restaurant!  It felt like each table around us was like 10 feet away.  Luckily our server was nice, but a tad on the unattentive side mainly because...we were seated 10 feet away from everyone else.  It's like she had to make a mini trek to get to our table.    The kids were amused with Margaritaville for all of 10 minutes.  Ooh, an airplane!  Ahh, a slide!  Ooo, palm trees!  After that, eh.  Then all the questions.  \"Why is it so noisy in here?\"  \"How come those people are laughing so loud?\"  \"Why are they playing this song AGAIN?\"  \"There are lots of salt shakers here.  How did they lose it?\"  I don't know kids, I don't know.  Go back to drinking your margaritas.    The food at Margaritaville is interesting in concept, but I think the execution comes out as MEH.  Really on the average side.  We came here mainly because the kids wanted to share a round of Margaritaville's famous Volcano Nachos.  This $16 behemoth really did resemble a small volcano!  Ginormous!  Easily could feed 5 people with a mound of tortilla chips topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and green onions.  But honestly, anyone can make nachos.  They tasted okay, but not the best nachos I've ever had.  Chili kinda tasted store bought.  Biggest peeve?  I hate when I have too many nacho chips but not enough cheese!  This volcano of a nacho pile had hardly any cheese when you hit the middle!  If I wanted plain chips I would have asked for plain chips.  It's like that one guy at McDonald's who makes your soft serve cone in a swirl with a big pocket of air in the middle.  Bastard!    Rest of the food there?  Overpriced!  Come on, $13 for a cheeseburger?  $20 for coconut shrimp?  It's expensive to live in paradise!  Not much different fare than your local chain restaurant.  But the drinks do look tasty.  Besides Volcano Nachos we ended up just ordering two cheeseburgers off the kids menu.  Nothing special.  Margaritaville is open daily, 365 days a year for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Just the way you would figure a crazy island in the tropics.  You can have your island fever fix just about any time of the day.  Just don't forget your sunglasses and your SPF 5000.  It's still Vegas after all!",

    "text": "It's alright overall. The food is average, nothing too special. You can easily get better food and much better priced off the strip anywhere. This is just a touristy area that traps all those tourists that come to visit without a vehicle or know where to go.   My main complaint is the service which was pretty bad, some of it is forgivable but a good chunk of it isn't. I won't outright name the server on here but I will definitely not be coming back because of him unless I get a friend who works here as my server.   We came in with a party of 10 or 12, they put together a set of tables of different kinds, some round and some rectangle, like okay seriously? You can't put together a bunch of rectangular shapes and call it a day? You had to add the odd shaped table to our group, not that big of a deal we can manage. We were here to celebrate a birthday so it wasn't that big of a deal.   We expected slow service with our group, it's normal so that's not anything I'll comment on. When the server finally came around with waters and asked us what we wanted for drinks. I ordered a passion fruit guava cocktail and someone on the other end of the table ordered a watermelon agave fresca. Not all of us knew each other as it was a birthday celebration, there's bound to be people you just met and have the birthday girl as a mutual friend so I didn't know the person that ordered the watermelon agave fresca. Our server mixed our drinks up, when the other person told him it was screwed up because she took a sip out of it, the server came back to me and asked if I had taken a drink which I answered no and he apologized that he mixed the drinks and gave me the drink which someone else took a sip out of and gave the other person her drink. Now, normally servers will ask to have your drink replaced because they messed up and someone else took a swig of it. I was expecting that, but nope he didn't. He placed the already drunken drink down on front of me and I was disgusted. Not only do I get less of a drink but I also had someone I didn't know drink out of it and he expected me to drink it? If it was someone I knew I wouldn't have cared as much.  The next thing that happened was ordering a second round of drinks, I asked for a beer, didn't specify what kind of beer I wanted and the server brought a landshark in a 20oz cup, I wanted a landshark but I didn't know there were multiple sizes and the server assumed I wanted the large size with the extra $3 charge.   If I was being charged $10 for a drink I would have gotten another specialty drink instead of a beer, it's overpriced for a landshark. When I confronted the server he got super defensive saying that I just wanted a beer, after a few friends ordered beers, which is fine but if you made a mistake at least own up to it and not argue with me that I wasn't specific in what I wanted. The menu only had one price on it and I was expecting that price and size of beer.  His only saving grace was showing me there was another bathroom when the main bathrooms were closed.   TL;DR version  -Bad server, I'm never going back unless people I know are working.  -Expect attitude from the servers there who make assumptions and charge you extra. -If I wasn't in with a party I would have walked out because THAT is how bad my experience was. -Food is average and expensive",

However, we had heard the Margaritaville was a neat place for kids. Well we decided to give it a try. We have been to some of the other Margaritaville Restaurants around the country so we knew what to expect. But it was a fantastic experience. They have cool people on stilts walking around making balloon hats and creations for big (adults) and little kids alike. They also have a cool Jurassic World menu right now. We had the loaded chips which were fantastic by the way. I had the fish tacos, my wife had the buttermilk fried chicken, the kids had the dino nuggets. Everyone enjoyed their food. My wife said that the buttermilk fried chicken was some of the best she had every had (that's saying something, she is SUPER PICKY). The service was phenomenal, to the point where when they found out we were locals, they told us about all of their other events. Our waiter, I think his name was Jeff (sorry not-Jeff if I got your name wrong), was fantastic and attentive and friendly. Could not have asked for better service. Very good and we will be back, but maybe we will wait until EDC is over. For the kids, the sights of the people waiting in line for the Box Office we a little too much.",

I was disappointed but decided that lunch was worth a try. Glad we stayed and dined. I ordered the seafood bisque and caesar salad along with a bahama mama. Both food and drink were delicious and fairly reasonable (price-wise) by Vegas standards. The review would have been a 4 but the service was off-it was very friendly, but we spent a lot of time waiting and it wasn't really busy.   I will certainly be back on future trips.",

And fifteen years later, I'm still ordering their nachos, but DAYUM, they were still great! I'd equate them to Yard House, but just piled more vertically. Definitely the best sober-up food you could ask for. I got some sort of variation of a Long Island and it was strong as hell. The bartender was a little on the defensive, since two rude people came in demanding shots when he was already busy, but once me and my pals treated him nicely, he was all smiles and strong pours. I always have fun here, and the drinks are worth the money.",

Kahla has to be the best bartender we have come a crossed working the entire bar and treating everyone as if he has known them forever!  We had gone back the next day as well and he recognized us and had given us a small taste of the frozen as we always get on the rocks and kept up the same service with everyone around no matter if they were staying and eating or simply taking their drink to go.",

They comped my meal but still, I was served garbage.    I will say that my wife's salad was ok as well as our drinks and the service was fantastic.

I was seated on the side with 3 folks and had to turn my neck and body to be able to see the others in my seat.  So it was an uncomfortable seating arrangements to start off and that didn't get better.  It was not very crowded but I think they were short staffed so that is why we had to wait to be seated. Once seated service was decent.  It had a beachy feel. I know folks talk about the roving entertainment but this night we did see the guy walking around on stilts but he was just walking around he did not appear to be doing anything or interacting with the patrons.  The location is right on the Vegas Strip so I guess that makes it appealing.  We were walking so not sure about parking.  All in all I would say reserve your margaritavile visits for a more beachy location.",

We've eaten on the third floor patio and inside the building, it just doesn't matter. All fantastic.   Due to an unfortunate series of events last night, this morning I am drinking iced tea. But, it's great tea! Thankfully, we picked a time with a small crowd and limited noise.   Not feeling terribly sophisticated this morning, I decided we should split a Southwest chicken salad and grilled chicken strips. The salad is out of this world with flavour. Plenty of sweet corn, black beans and fresh avocado. Maybe it's me, but even the greens seem fresher today. I would really like the dressing recipe, sweet yet not overpowering.  The chicken strips for lightly breaded with almost a fish batter taste. My favourite part was the light and tender fish inside. Not too crunchy and not soggy or soft.  We asked for all three sauces and they were fabulous. The barbecue sauce tasted like it had a littttttle bit of alcohol in it. It did not. The honey mustard was very good as well as the ranch.   Paul L. Was our server and he did a fantastic job. He was friendly as hell and he kept the glasses filled, you know I love that.",

We had to go find our own plates to share the appetizers as our waiter disappeared and each time she came by, she asked a quick question and then left so fast that we didn't have time to even answer everything.",

You follow the slots far enough into the casino you'll end up at the Flamingo. Its a very convenient stop if your by the isle next to Linq. You'll get a cold frozen drink to chill you out, bar food that'll stuff you, in a fun tropical ambiance, all for an affordable price that wont break the bank. This is the kind of place you can stumble into and blend right in with all the commotion and noise all around ya in this fun filled atmosphere! XD",

I'm pretty shy so I don't usually ask for those things, but I think it's horrible that I didn't receive anything for such a mistake that could cause health problems from the restaurant themselves, one shouldn't have to ask for that, it should just be standard in case of an event like this. At least the service was good and the place seems like fun at night",

EWWWW he's not feeling anything so the sticky ness from the dirty glasses, the dirt from the money, from the cards he's touching. i'm sorry to go in to detail but i'm grossed out. i'm glad i'm not ordering a drink because i would've politely asked him to either not touch any of my garnishes or my straw that i'm going to put my mouth on. the. i order 2 to go sprites and i get two huge cups with no lid... I ask for lid they don't have any ????",

We ordered drinks, a couple margs both on the rocks and blended. The drinks came out way quick than expected for our party of 5. Recommend the watermelon marg - so yummy.  This place has typical food. this can be a plus however, since there is probably something to please everyone in your party. I ordered a chicken bacon sandwich. I should have asked to add avocado -  would have made the sandwich. All the other food we got, ( cheeseburger, chicken skewers, fish tacos, and a salad) were good. Nothing blow you out of the water, but good.   The restrooms were a complete disaster so avoid them if you can. Nothing totally wrong here, but if you are in Vegas, go someplace that is more that just a solid meal. I also thought for the quality of the food, the prices were 3-4 $ too expensive.",

Las night I went in with my partner and ordered the jambalaya and seafood Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese, great, but the jamabalaya was so salty it was unbearable. I felt like I was eating a salt shaker. Then went in for breakfast and ordered the steak and eggs (twice). My steak, ordered medium, was cooked more than well. Sent back and came back, well again! The taste was ungodly and then the eggs, ordered over medium, were so undercooked the egg whites were runny. Go here to get a great cocktail! My bartender this morning was incredible! So nice, attentive and fun, but unfortunately the food was unbearable. And I'm a local, please don't recommend this place unless you want a good drink.",

After walking the strip and being practically assaulted by overly eager men trying to give me \"free samples\" and selling questionable beauty products, we made our way to Margaritaville in the Margaritaville casino. I really needed a break from the high-pressure salespeople everywhere.   Let me say that if I could give this place a 3 1/2, I would. I am torn between a 3 and a 4.   It was dead in there at lunchtime on a weekday so we got a table right away. A while later, a friendly lady comes around asking if we want our picture taken for \"free\". I know better--we do a lot of traveling, and usually when they are eager to take your picture it's not because they are trying to decorate their walls or because you just look so great that day! She sure seemed eager, taking shots of all of us, then just my husband and me, then the kids. Of course, a few minutes later she was back with our tiny free postcard picture, and the other three she took were for sale for $10 each. The pictures were actually really cute. My husband was on his 2nd or 3rd \"perfect margarita\". So of course he bought them! They were cute pictures but my opinion? How very tacky!  We're in Vegas and we didn't win. We're spending enough on your food and drinks and you come around with talk of free pictures. It was really unnecessary. I can see it at a place like Graceland or Disney, something like that. But not at a restaurant in Vegas.  As for the atmosphere, I love all the Margaritavilles I've been to. This one is no exception. If you like Jimmy Buffett, palm trees, and all things tropical, you'll enjoy it.  Let's move on to the important part: the drinks. My husband loves those perfect margaritas! My personal favorite is the Bama Breeze. So yummy! It's kind of like an alcoholic creamsicle. How can you go wrong with THAT? (FYI \"Bama\" is short for Alabama, where Jimmy B. came from--I learned that in Orlando once after mispronouncing it!).  I had a burger and it was tasty. I believe it was called the \"cheeseburger in paradise\". I can't remember what hubby and the kids got, but they all seemed happy. The food in general is good at Margaritaville, all the locations I've been to.   So I would recommend this place. But get ready to \"say cheese\"! And remember: nothing is free in life or in Vegas.",

She took great care of us always making sure out drinks were filled, made some small talk and had our food out in a snap!  She was very informative about the locals discounts in the Linq area.  Like I said, she was great!  We decided to split the volcano burger.  It was topped with volcano chili, jalapenos, fritos and cheese.  It was just ok.   The burger was overcooked to our liking.  Surprising it was a little dry even with all of the toppings smothering it.  Fries were good and crisp.   I was glad that we split this meal because it was more than enough food.   Did I mention we started with the pretzels and cheese?  Maybe that's why I was so full.  The pretzels were soft and delicious.  I wouldn't mind getting them again.    This was just one of the places I've been wanting to try.  Food is ok and thanks to Clarissa, the service was great!",

Anyone that is GF know how awful / mealy a bun can become once it has juice from meat or even mayo on it. My husband had the Rancho burger and fries, needless to say he did not leave a crumb behind. We will definitely come back on our next trip. The entertainment was excellent with people singing on stilts as well as a mermaid thing. :)",

My only complain is that on Thursday night when my husband and I went all they were serving was burgers, being Vegan this was just not going to work. I can work with Vegetarian options but in this case I had no choice. Boo, that sucked. But we did return and I am glad we did! On Sunday afternoon, my husband and I head to eat around 3pm we were seated right away and within the minute the server came to get our drinks. She recommend a Peach & Raspberry Margarita in the Souvenir Blender which we went ahead and got. It was SO good! Highly highly recommend, it is not on the Menu but it should be! I got the Veggie Burger with Fries and my husband got a steak with shrimp. The food was super super good! It was totally worth going back, after my minor upset days before. Another plus was they had a live band! The music was nice, and my son started dancing in his high chair. The manager came over and asked if she could take him on stage! We agreed, and she walked him up the stage and he had his dance with the singer/guitarist. It was really nice. As always I love Margaritaville it is a must go when you go to Vegas the customer service is great the whole staff was friendly and made the experience great. The food is super good, and the drinks are amazing. Having live music is such a plus, it is nice they play music any way but live music makes it better. I also love the decor very very under the sea type of atmosphere. A must go! Highly recommend :D",

Okay definitely not satisfied even if it had cost half that amount. So not only was the nachos mediocre but way over priced even if they give you a large quantity.",

We were also expecting to be able to get our hands on the tall, long margarita cups that we assumed were sold here, but we were disappointed to find out that we were at the wrong place for this. Nonetheless, it did not prevent us from having our final meal in Vegas.  Upon arrival, we noticed a handful of people waiting to be seated and hoped that it wouldn't be a long wait as our flight departed in a couple hours. Luckily, from the time we requested a table to actually being seated, it was no more than 15 minutes. Our server assisted us within 5 minutes of being seated and took our drink orders. There were a variety of drinks to choose from; I ordered the Big Rita on the rocks and also was interested in the Mango Frozen margarita. Both were excellent and brought to us 5 minutes after ordering them. We didn't order appetizers but it was really amazing seeing what the Volcano nachos looked like at the table next to ours. One word describes them: humongous! As for our food, we ordered burgers, quesadillas, and a chicken burger, all of which came with fries. The food was much better than expected and delicious. The burger was full of flavor and went perfectly with my drink.   The staff was friendly, the portions were generous and the overall quality excellent.  The prices are reasonable with the drinks always being expensive as with the rest of Vegas.",

I'd never been, so I thought we would check it out since it is a Vegas institution.  What a rip off! We ordered one of those really huge margarita pitchers for everyone in our group to drink. I had about 4 or 5 glasses from it and instead of being drunk or even just BUZZED, all I had was a sore throat from the sweet and sour mix.   I will say the volcano nachos were good, I shared with a friend of mine. My husband ordered the Buffalo wings but wasn't impressed. I was pretty disappointed that a place known for their margaritas served such bad ones, however. My husband and I  headed straight to Fat Tuesday to rectify the drink situation and were pretty happy after that.  Probably won't be back if I can help it!",

Fuck yes. If you sit there long enough and drink enough of them, suddenly you'll find yourself running down Las Vegas Boulevard at full speed against traffic with your shirt off and not remember a damn thing. Good times.  Second reason: rare burgers. You know, I get fucking completely tired of places cooking their burgers all the way through if I specifically ask for rare. I assume the risk that I might get ecoli or mad cow when I eat rare meat. Needless to say I'm stoked that margaritaville will oblige me and give me my fucking rare burger.   That's it.

I really hate paying cover so this immediately made me happy.  We were a rather large group and they were very accommodating in moving tables and chairs together so we could all sit as a group.  It was cool that they had a large dance floor and the live band would alternate playing with the DJ.  The band was pretty talented because at one point or another, everyone had a chance to be the lead singer.  They played a good mix of country, rock, rap, & pop.  They basically catered to a variety of musical tastes so you were bound to hear something that you would like.    The drinks were kind of expensive.  It was $4.50 for a small plastic cup of Bud light, but I didn't mind since there was no cover to get in.  The service was slightly less than adequate since the waitress had already guaranteed her gratuity since we were a large party, she kind of just hid in the corner and ate her food.  I don't see why we would have to shell out nearly $40 for her, when she was in the corner talking to her friend and eating most of the night.  I had to get up and tap her on the shoulder to order more drinks.  Overall, the service could have been a little bit better, but I had fun and have no real complaints.",

The wait sucked, but once we sat down we found the food to be decent. Nachos were pretty good, but coming from Texas I've eaten far better nachos in my day... bigger doesn't always mean better! Drinks were decent but pricey (when on the strip one can't be in denial, you have to learn to accept that all drink prices suck!).   Atmosphere was incredibly cheesey.. but it will put you in that vacation mood!",

I won money! :D  They have seating downstairs, upstairs, or outside. They have videos everywhere for you to watch. They get very busy.  They have this guy on stilts walking around, saying hi etc. Kinda scary.  Nevertheless, the nachos are bomb! I love them! The margaritas are really good. You can't really go wrong. I mean it is margaritaville after all.   Come one come all. Have a good drink, great nachos, ppl watch and just chill.",

    "text": "This is a busy place, plan for a long wait, if you dont have kids you can do this in the festive bar. If you go for dinner-time, you will be quite entertained once an hour with two Buffet classics, 'Volcano' and Margaritaville (with a bikini-clad girl sliding down the faux-volcano into a giant blue margarita where she gyrates and swims, and then dances with the rest of the characters in the place (two on stilts).  You cant help but sing along and smile.   My wife and her friend shared the volcano nachos and that was too much for them - although my wife complained about the use of Velveeta (in the middle, real cheese had been sprinkled on top) and the fact that even if you order it 'chicken' it still is loaded with beef (because of the chili, the waiter claimed). I had the Jambalaya, mildly spicy, tons of rice and not much of the andouille (spelling?) sausage and a few shrimp, very filling and tasted good.  Son had the Cheeseburger (in Paradise) and wolfed that down.  Other son had fajitas which smelled fantastic and he said he liked. The characters on stilts were doing balloon art/sculptures, and they came by, and made flower hats for the ladies, I tipped her $5 (my wife FREAKED out, I thought that was about right, she thought I was overboard) Weird thing, some gal comes round, with beads and trinkets and leis, spouting something about  \"Save the TaTas\", I could barely hear over the din, wanting me to donate and I would receive some trinket in exchange, I said no....later my wife explained it was for breast cancer, duh, BUT, on reflecting I dont think I'd believe any donated cash I gave in a casino-related facility in Las Vegas would EVER reach its final destination. So, prices were pretty high, and the 1hr wait, and the ok food gets this joint 3 stars.  The entertainment and lively ambience made it fun to go to.",

We started with the tortilla soup, which was pretty much chicken chili. More like a thick sauce and not very soupy. Again, mediocre.  I had the Caribbean chicken salad. The cucumbers were cut into tiny pieces with the skin left on which was bitter and tough to chew. The chicken seemed to have been defrosted, which gave it a very weird texture.  My fiance had the chicken pasta, which was the highlight of our meal, but definitely not enough food for my hungry boy. We spent about $75 included a martini and a beer, but I can definitely find better food elsewhere for a much better price.  The worst part was the round of waters brought with the meal that no one ordered, which explained why we were never brought soda or beer refills after that, since we didn't see the waiter again until he started to usher us out with our check.  Our table of 7 was right in the middle of where the dance floor usually is. And the management stood near the bus station staring us down and tapping their toes till we vacated the table. Once one of us stood up, the bus boys were there clearing the table before we could even breathe.  We felt very unwelcome and will never go back.",

When we were done eating it took a long time for the waiter to walk by to see that we were done. The music was good but really loud, we had to almost yell to hear each other.   If you're looking for decent food but willing to hang out for a while this place would be ok but if you're looking to go in, eat, and go on with exploring Vegas I would recommend somewhere else.",

    "text": "So my parents were in town last week. When I told them I was going to write these reviews, they asked to not use their names. Guess they've read some of my other writing.  So when I found out The Griswalds (as I lovingly refer to my parents... gold star if you know what series of movies this is from) were coming, I got all these options and places lined up, and when I asked what they were in the mood for, I got... Margaritaville.  \"Your dad likes Jimmy Buffet.\" -- Mrs. Griswald. \"Your mom likes margaritas.\" -- Mr. Griswald.  Margaritaville is about as touristy as touristy gets. I should know, it's somewhere I went very soon after moving here. It's smack in the middle of the Strip, attached to Flamingo Hotel & Casino, so it's never not busy. It has about three different bars, and a retail store. How much Jimmy Buffet can one person handle? If I believed everything inside Margaritaville, it's five o'clock EVERYWHERE. At all times. Whether you like it or not.  It would all be worth it if the food was amazeballs. But really it was just good. Not wow, not great, not OMG. Just good. I had a BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and it was okay. I would have expected more barbecue sauce on a \"BBQ\" sandwich. My folks split a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and they were satisfied with it.  But how were the margaritas? I mean it's called \"Margaritaville,\" they must have bomb diggity fresh margaritas, right?   They're okay. I've had better. Ricardo's has great margaritas. Hell, even TGI Friday's could compare to Margaritaville.  I can't say it was godawful. It wasn't. But it was nothing special, aside from the facts that the Griswalds like it, and that's a-okay with me. I'm a local, so I probably won't be going back soon. But if you have tourists in town who insist on staying on the Strip, it's not a death sentence.",

And, as far as prices, compared to the other restaurants on the strip this was on par or better than other places we ate at. Loved the atmosphere. The waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was terrific. I felt comfortable having my 8 year old daughter there--and she was happy to get a balloon animal. She asked me how to get one and I said, \"sit here and look like you want a balloon animal.\" And, that worked. Bahama Mama was awesome. Although I was looking for a Hurricane on the menu. I wish there was a Margaritaville closer to us in MI. Maybe I'll add visiting all of them to my bucket list.",

Long & Wasted Away:    In a past life I worked at a Hard Rock Cafe for a year, so I know about places like this.  They try to capitalize on tourists and nostalgia.  HRC has this down to a science, Margaritaville on the other hand is a disgrace.    Food:  It's okay.  Burgers, chicken, salads, etc.  Basically nothing memorable.    Drinks:  Overpriced, watered down, lame.  Atmosphere:  Would've been cool if they had been playing Jimmy Buffet!  We got to hear Nirvana, The Squeeze, Madonna, etc.  I mean, what the hell is that crap?    Service:   AWFUL!  We were there for my Brother-in-law's 40th and were rushed along like it was lunch.

So, I have to ask Jimmy.    Jimmy, if you are reading this by chance, what happened?  Your name is sprayed all over the bosom of this five dollar Mexican hooker of a restaurant.  It's disgusting!    Should you go here?  Go to Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, or anyplace else if you need to go to a place like this at all.  Would I go here again?

    "text": "I used to come here regularly. And from my rating, you can see that that has changed. The last two times I came were complete disasters. One time isn't really their fault but it tells you the type of people you may encounter (though you would probably encounter them anywhere). Anyhow, let me get back to the story. It's a laid-back place with a live band you can dance to. So I put my sweater on the speaker (which I've done many times before) so that I could dance without the extra bulk. To make the long story short, my sweater was stolen. I actually approached the girl who argued with me and ran off with it. And I'm not kidding about that. I admit I wasn't quick enough to go after her because I was in shock, I definitely did not expect that at all. The workers of course could not help. Anyhow, it sounds petty but I like that sweater and it's ridiculous that that even happened. I actually didn't come for a couple of months because I was still annoyed by that.  Anyhow, I finally did decide to make another visit... Ok, so onto the actual place- food, drinks, and music. All were terrible the last time I was here. In fact, I brought some family and friends and was completely embarrassed by how bad it was. They had a new band and they were terrible. (The old band used to play the same songs but at least they did a good job). It took me a while to figure out what this new band was playing, which ended up being \"Yeah\" by Ludacris. That's a pretty distinct song and it's bad that I couldn't even tell what they were playing! Well, since we finally found a table, we figured we'd hang out even with the terrible music. So everyone ordered their drinks. I ordered my usual margarita on the rocks. Wow, that was also terrible. Seriously, is it possible for everything to change that much in a couple of months? In fact, it became somewhat of a game as everyone tried everyone else' drink to see whose was the worst. I think mine won. Actually, I can't even comment on the food because I think we gave up after the drinks. (I used to always want the nachos but I was afraid to try that this time).  So I definitely do not recommend this place and will not come back (and haven't since these last experiences).",

The water was awful, tasted like they got it from the pool.  I know this is not the place to go for water but it would've been nice to get a little hydration in before venturing out into 115 degrees.  The waitress couldn't get my order straight for the life of her.  I was the first to order; a draft bud light, a glass of water and a black and bleu burger.  She brought everyone their water, except me. Brought me bottled beer after I asked for draft. The food was served, I didn't get anything.  The food runner had to take my order prior to leaving the table.  No apologies from the waitress for anything just that it would be a few more minutes. I'd come back for the food but not the service.",

    "text": "Ah Jimmy Buffett---sort of your parents' Sammy Hagar. This place runs expensive, and it took a long time to get served due to seemingly failing to have a host on staff from the direction we came in (later on, after they held my left-behind credit card kindly for me and when I returned for it, I realized the host dwells in a different location to enter in). Looking for a really cheap meal, we had the volcano nachos which was just such an excessive amount of food, probably fit for 5 people, so make sure you bring at least 3 people or the prices won't make sense. You're supposed to get drinks here, but their items seemed pricey so we skipped the drinks. Am I missing something about the Jimmy Buffett dynasty that makes the menu so expensive? I guess you're supposed to buy the drinks so that you can eat that quantity of food huh?  Inside there is non-stop video footage of the fun-times man himself on his namesake island in Florida...all around a good place to hang if this kind of thing makes you nostalgic, not really my kind of thing, but I won't knock it for that. I guess, if anything, Jimmy Buffett reminds me of sing-alongs in grade school and the way your parents envisioned the \"good life\". At any rate, the nachos were filling, so mission accomplished.",

I don't know what is happening there but the menu is not good anymore.  They used to have a great menu, great salads and food but not anymore, everything is fried and the salads are boring.  It's really gone downhill and not sure why.  They still have good Margaritas and I liked that if you sit at the bar they actually serve you your drink in a glass glass rather than plastic, but I think that's the only positive thing I can say though.",

Booths made to look like he back of fishing boats. There's a giant sea plant hanging from the ceiling too. They have a stage set up for live music as well as a projector and screen for videos that play along with music when a band isn't playing. Now for the food. It's pretty good I've always gotten the rancho deluxe burger, but I'm a burger guy. My dad usually gets the French dip which he likes. I was here with someone who ordered fish tacos and those were good as well. The servers are pretty good but some could use some retraining. One person refilling my water spilled all over my iPhone. Understandably I wasn't happy and she didn't help by immediately asking if it still worked. I got lucky since she spilled right on the speaker on top so water could have easily gotten inside. They have a store next to the restaurant where you can get anything you want with the Margaritaville logo as well as barbecue sauces and different seasonings. We usually bring some back to my brothers. Just beyond the store is he Margaritaville themed casino in the Flamingo. It's in a good spot on the strip too, you can easily walk here or park in the back and walk up through the Linq with all the shops. This is a cool place to hang out and grab something to eat.",

Despite her being so busy, she would always drop by our table every now and then to ask us how we were, occasionally staying to chit-chat for a bit.   My family was seated at a comfy booth overlooking the stage. This was at about 9:30pm. The lights were dimmed and when we noticed that the spotlight was aimed at the stage, we knew there was going to be a live band and couldn't contain ourselves. Before delving into the restaurant's ambiance, I'm pretty sure my parents would agree with me that the food was pretty savory - although nothing out of the ordinary to be honest. We had a triple decker sandwich that came with fries, crab and corn chowder as well as buffalo wings. Except for the soup, definitely try out the other 2 orders.   Music started at 10pm sharp and went on for an hour. I was very impressed with the band's line-up and still couldn't quite get over the fact that they sang one of the hardest and my most favourite songs - More than a feeling by Boston. Sure, it was pretty loud but what would you expect at a Vegas restaurant? We didn't really get a chance to talk while the band played which helped us channel our focus solely on the food. I guess that's a good thing. Overall, I would recommend people to try out the place. Just take note of this; if you like a more mellow ambiance, try getting to the restaurant earlier in the day.",

Drinks are small and expensive, and the food is so-so.   Would have all been better if they hadn't thrown in a 10% extra tax for the band playing. Listen to a mediocre band, and $9 beers became $10 beers, magically. They expect that you are quite aware of this quirk before you sit down, or else it's a nice little surprise when the receipt comes.",

If you want to transport yourself to an island oasis filled with booze, good music and good times, this is the place for you.  DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's Margaritaville- enough said. There's a huge stage and a huge volcano with a slide that leads into a giant blender cup. We were lucky enough to hear the song Volcano play and watch an entertainer pop out of the volcano into the cup and dance. It's simply fun and beachy here. They had entertainers on stilts that were making awesome balloon hats- not like ones from your average childrens party. They were making birthday ones with numbers and other ones with words.  MENU: The menu is casual and comfortable. Whether you want a Cheeseburger in Paradise or the lava lava shrimp, you can and will find something you like on it. Seriously- there's salads, sandwiches, dessert and so much more that everyone can find something they like (even your Vegan friend, Sara).  BOOZE: Overpriced, but hey, it's Vegas, so what isn't? Plus, once you win from gambling, you can afford it! Their margaritas and boat drinks are delicious. I personally love the Last Mango in Paris margarita (mango marg) and the One Particular Harbor boat drink ( vanilla rum, pineapple and blueberry puree). These drinks are not weak, either.  TL;DR: I'd come here 10/10 times and drink, eat and stay awhile.",

We split the BBQ burger and were in and out in like 30 mins. No hassle or upselling. Prompt service and tasty food that filled us both! We even got water cups to go which in Vegas you know you need ;) thank you Ryan!",

    "text": "Overrated.  The wait to eat here was about an hour. We thought it would be worth it, so we stuck it out. When we finally made it to the table, we looked over the menu. It was a list of unimpressive and basic overpriced food. The drink list is more creative, but not creative enough to justify the prices. All the cocktails sounded like sugar concoctions with splashes of alcohol.   Our waiter was the typical chain restaurant waiter, just enough personality to be pleasant. The service was slow and we felt as if we were waiting for the majority of our meal.   The decor was extravagant and over the top. Model ships and fishing gear were placed around almost every table. There were screens and TVs scattered across the walls playing Jimmy Buffet-esqe music videos.   The dinner show was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" for me. People danced around on stilts and a woman in a bikini took a dive into a tank that was about 20 feet from our table. It is silly and unnecessary.",

    "text": "So here's the deal... Is the place a \"tourist trap\"? Oh hell yes!!! Does that mean one is unable to have a good time there??? Oh hell no...  The place is huge, can get a bit loud, even a bit \"festive\" at times and the food is just OK. Prices are what one would expect for a Vegas \"tourist trap\" but that's where the ordinary ends, (at least as far as I'm concerned).  We both ordered \"chicken sandwiches with side salads\". Nothing spectacular... But prior, I ordered a 22 oz Landshark draft, (which I have had before), and the wifey ordered a \"Planters Punch\". Not sure if she is no longer the drinker she used to be or if they double dutied that bad boy, but that thing quickly put her happy ass smack dab on  the corner of \"Shitfaced & Happy Go Lucky\". What a buzz it gave her!!! Too frickin' funny.  Naturally, I had to indulge in some Margarita Madness after seeing that shit so I promptly ordered a Margarita Flight. Had never even heard of a \"Margarita Flight\" prior, much less order / drink one!!! Soon, I too took up residence on the \"Twisted Turnpike\". Damn good thing we were walking...  Can't remember the last time I was so freakin' happy to spend $90 on a meal, lol.  A cool place to grab a quick bite, cool refreshing beverage and waste away...  Will definitely try a two-fer flight next time and double my pleasure!!!",

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender. We were indecisive on drinks, but she was super patient and helped us out, and we ended up going with the Mac Daddy 45oz blender pitcher with a frozen margarita topped with a float. You have to get the volcano nachos, they are freaking awesome, and HUGE - a great appetizer for 2-4 hungry hippos. For dinner, I ordered the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp and Grits and the husband ordered the Oven Baked chicken with Mashed Potatoes and roasted corn.  The Shrimp and Grits was incredible. The Grits were perfectly cooked, cheesy goodness. The andouille sausage has fantastic flavor and the shrimp were large, juicy and sooo good. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits, you will not be disappointed. Hubby said the oven baked chicken was delicious, incredibly flavorful and juicy. There are some restaurants on the strip that are over priced, have horrible service and mediocre food, but Margaritaville is not one of them. The atmosphere, location and over-all experience was wonderful, thank you for a great time!

The back bar has maybe 15 barstools and we were lucky to grab 4 together about 2:00 on a Saturday. It was busy and loud, but the bartenders were fast with the drinks...and refilling our water.   They did give some other people a hard time, a middle aged woman wanted to order some drinks for her bachelorette party while they waited for a table and the bartender made her bring back all of the people in her group including her 75 year old grandma. He carded all of the 25-30ish year old women, including the one who was pregnant and just wanted water. It was awkward.",

Its a Jimmy Buffet themed Casino Bar,  boutique and Restaurant. At the Casino bar they do a $5 select drink happy hour from 2am to 10am. You can play video poker,  and have a drink.  Happy Hour and well drinks comp if you play video poker at the bar with a max bet.  The food at the restaurant is amazing.  My friend got Volcano Nachos.  Delicious.  Just all the stuff is piled on the top and sides.  But awesome and huge.   I had the buttermilk chicken which was a tasty southern fried dish with green beans and mashed potatoes covered in a southern gravy.  My friend had the NY strip dinner. Cooked to perfection. They provide live entertainment around 7pm. With an aerial act on Monday night and Sunday night live music.    The drink menu is vast and it will truly make you feel as if you are wasting away... My fav is the Tranquil Waters.   On you way out, get your Jimmy Buffet swag.  Perfect for any Parrot Head.",

Less than a minute left of the game and they decided that was the time to start their show in the restaurant which consists of them turning off the game on the big screens and showing an old school concert and having three people dance around on stilts. I would have rather seen the last minute of the biggest basketball game of the year. The show would have been nice to see at any other time during our meal than the last minute of the game. The whole hour we were there they only decided to dance when we didn't want to see it. Super bummed.   Only saw our waitress at the beginning when she got our drink orders and food. Never came to check on us and was Mia when we wanted our check.   I ordered a sandwich with an additional salad and sweet potato fries. I assumed they were going to serve me the salad first and then bring out my sandwich with the fries but that's not how it happened. The sandwich came on the same plate as the salad and I literally got a side of fries. Ok  whatever I guess I will have to be more specific next time if there is a next time.",

This time, it was country music but that apparently did not stop us from dancing.   Soon after that, Margaritaville became a regular stop for us during the rest of our stay here.  I got the raspberry and mango margaritas, frozen, on separate occasions.   How they make their flavored margaritas is that they just poor syrup into the cup and then top it off with their house margaritas. I mean, it gets the job done, but depending on who makes your drink it may not be completely mixed together all the way. But, the house margarita itself is really good so it's not too bad. I liked the raspberry one better than the mango.  Would return once I'm no longer margarita'd out.",

It did take awhile for someone to take our drink order but after that, the service was good. I got a draft beer and the fish n chips. My boyfriend got a soda and the Mac n cheese with shrimp. Both were excellent! Whenever we come back to Las Vegas, we would surely come back here again.",

Everything from the atmosphere to the drinks to the food to the service was extraordinary. The food was delicious and we even took a couple of the \"last mango of paris\" drinks to go, which is one of the best things about Vegas. We also visited the shop and bought a Margaritaville tumbler drink cup. This was my first visit here but I look forward to a return. The service was attentive, friendly and funny, and greatly contributed to our experience.",

    "text": "Today was my second time visiting Margaritaville in Las Vegas. The first time I had attended was about 7+ years ago. From what I remembered, the food was great, the drinks were amazing, and the atmosphere was so much fun!! I'm visiting Las Vegas for my birthday for the weekend. Today is National Margarita day, I'm in Vegas, it's Friday...why not? :)  I went in asking how long was the wait for a table, and I was told about 30 minutes. Mind you it being National Margarita Day, Margaritaville having specials on their house margaritas, AND it was 4PM on a Friday...I thought it was reasonable. I ended up waiting only about 15 minutes before I was seated. Woot woot. :)  My server was Robert. He was really nice, attentive, and answered all my questions. He had a lot of fun energy that fit well with the place. I ordered the tropical margarita with the strawberry/mango combined, the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp & Grits, the jalapeno mac n cheese, and a side of french fries. I was hungry!  The Louisiana Cajun Shrimp & Grits was amazing! Lots of flavor, a nice bit of spice (could it kicked it up a little bit more...still good nonetheless). The shrimp were huge and I got full after finishing 3/4 of the dish.  The jalapeno mac n cheese was delicious! It had a good amount of macaroni AND cheese. Nice amount of diced jalapeno for a spicy food lover like myself. It had a nice touch of cilantro sprinkled on top. Yum.  The tropical margarita was delicious and sweet. Instead of picking one flavor, I decided to have the strawberry and mango combined. I do not at all regret my choice.  Margaritaville is a must for anyone visiting Las Vegas. The food may be pricey to some, but, your're paying for the quality and amount. It's a fun, lively atmosphere, and there's alcohol drinks to choose from to your heart's content. Highly recommended spot. You will not be disappointed.",

I had the cheese burger in paradise with barbq sauce and a side of some kind of rice that came instead of the black beans that I ordered. (For the record the waitress did offer to bring the beans in addition but that would have meant the rice would go to waste and I don't like to do that...). I hemmed & hawed at what # of stars to give this place because the food was good, up stars no complaint, The burger was juicy, the bun not too firm or squishy, and the barbq sauce had a mayo consistency and was nice. Then we had a margarita... I've seen some of these other reviews here raving about them and I'm thinking they were drunk already when they had theirs. I was stone cold sober before I had my raspberry margarita, and just as sober afterwards. If there was alcohol in it, it may have been poured out by 1/4 teaspoon measure cuz it sure wasn't in jiggers. So I had a cup of pre-fab, frozen concentrate raspberry sugar on ice. I won't be coming back here again for $15 for sugar uncool-aid  Thank You Nikki. Tell your manager I will accept a drink WITH alcohol or a refund. I'm here all week.",

We had been given a few coupons on the strip for a free margarita with the purchase of $20 of food. That's was easy to do each entree was around $20. Our waiter got us all margaritas and they were hit or miss (they were all the same type and size margarita). Mine unfortunately was a huge miss! It was so sour and I couldn't tell there was alcohol in it, I swear it was just mix. I couldn't drink it, which really says something (I love margaritas especially free margaritas!) I ordered an appetizer that had 3 or 4 different items on it and I only enjoyed the artichoke dip and chicken tenders. My wife ordered the jambalaya and that was the saddest looking jambalaya I've ever seen, and it tasted how it looked. Uncle Ben's jambalaya with some shrimp in it would've taste better.",

I ordered the vegetarian taco salad and it was atrocious.  It was a taco bowl that was over cooked and shredded ice berg lettuce, a few shreds of cheese (not even an ounce) and 2 red peppers that were the size of my pinky fingernail.  It was a joke. The service was sub-par at best.  The music is so loud you can't talk to someone sitting next to you and trying to order was challenging at best.  The server can't hear your order and you have to shout at them.  I guess that's why the server never came back to check on us or ask us if we needed anything.  We had to keep flagging down other servers or bus boys to get water refills.  There are better restaurants on the strip that will at least give you better food and service for the same high prices.",

    "text": "Depends on what you are looking for. Its not fine dining but not bar food either.   I dont understand the people that complain about the tacky decor?? Its Vegas..have you visited the Wynn lately?   Anyway, we visit this place each time we are in Vegas.  At first we were surprised by the $12 Margaritas but after a couple, realized that they are worth it.  Top shelf tequila and usually plenty of it!  Their $12 margarita much better deal than the 8$ bud light at the PH pool.  The food is fairly good but we really come here for the atmosphere and the margaritas.  After like the 7th time here I finally discovered the third floor. Wow!  I am seriously pissed that I never went upstairs before!  Excellent view of the CP and the strip...and great to sit and enjoy the sun and soak up the LV atmosphere. My only complaint is that our first margarita was a little weak by Margaritaville standards but the next 4 were just as I remembered.  Stumbled out into the afternoon sunlight and had my best night gambling in 2 years!   A group of us come out here 2x/year and plan on visiting Margaritaville every time.  Keep the third floor open for us!",

Dennys serves a better one and for half the price. The perfect margurita was ok but i definately would of expected a \"wow\" from the home of the margurita. It was not even close. Sorry I wish I could recommend it but just can't. Overpriced ( I know its Vegas) but if the food was good I wouldn't of minded the tourist prices.  BTW - Very loud too.  Maybe I'm just getting old.",

We had a late lunch last week after we touched down and the nachos were super yummy but the Perfect Margarita was watered down and rather pettite. We split some burgers that were pretty juicy, but once I browsed the touristy gift shop, I was just about ready to write this place off, but I thought, hey I'm a little grumpy from traveling (I know, it's only 1.5 hours, but still) so I'll give it another try. We decided to stop by the bar the last day we were there (hours before we had to catch our plane) and I had 3 Perfect Margaritas. OK, I should have stopped at 2 b/c the drinks at the bar are way bigger and stronger than anything in the restaurant, plus it always helps to make friends with the bartender. So, the lesson learned, skip the restaurant but hit the bar for a killer Perfect Margarita and all you penny-pinchers, remember to tip your bartender. Good tips = good drinks!",

Part of lunch was the \"grand tour\" of the facility which is huge, seats 1200 people, employees 200-300 and hopes for business in Las Vegas to start an upward spiral.  Even with all comped, i must say the service was efficient and friendly, food items for all 7 of us were tasty, plentiful, cooked well and imaginative. Drinks were good as well. If I had a negative, it was that the noise level is very high. But, what they do is done well. It isn't a quiet sit down type of place... its' bubbly and party time atmosphere.",

Can't talk about other staff  Food  - Mediocre.  Nachos were huge.    Overall  - Obviously it's a tourist trap.  Duh.  Doesn't mean you won't have fun there.

So we put our name on the list and it took 30min to an hour for them to seat our party of 7. We were seated near the stage.  I ordered the jumbalaya which was not that great and I wished I would have save my money. My friend also got the jumbalaya and she didnt like it either. 1 of my friends ordered the nachos and it was huge! I think everyone else ordered the quesdillas, which looked good, but I think I tasted it and it was just ok. Some came and brought flowers for the girls to put in our ear and they also tried to sell os these wooden bead necklaces wwhich the proceeds went to Save the Ta-Tas (a breast cancer foundation). While we were eating some hula dancers performed. Also since it was my friends birthday they sang and brought her ice crwam or something. The drinks were expensive there, so we just waited and went across the street to Ceaser's Palace for Fat Tuesday. Also the theme there was quite confusing, b/c since its called Margaritaville you would think Mexican food, but they had all types of food, but then they had polynesian dancers, that place was just confused. I doubt I will go back.",

Our server tatayana was unfriendly and very rude. As soon as she heard we had a coupon and just wanted to do appetizers and drinks she pretty much just walked away. She came back to get the rest of our order and we didn't see her until she brought the check. Other employees brought out our food and drinks and they were very friendly and nice. We saw our server stop at every table around us and ask if everything was okay but she never once stopped by us. She gave us the worst service we had all week in Vegas. If I knew she was going to be our server I would not eat here. The food and drinks were great but the service sucked. It's like she looked down on us for having a coupon and just ordering nachos and drinks, definitely not a way to make customers feel welcomed at a restaurant.  I give it three stars because the food and drinks and other severs even hostess were so great.",

    "text": "We usually find our way to Margaritaville on every visit to Las Vegas.  It is a fun drinking and dining establishment.  Fun - the place is always crowded and loud, in a good way.  There is almost always a live band in the evening.  Folks get on the dance floor.  Large groups for birthdays or bachelorette parties keep the place lively.  I have seen staffers on stilts and making balloon sculptures for guests.  It is almost like stepping into Mardi Gras.  This is not a place for quiet conversation with your table-mates.  But, you probably already spent too much time talking to them already!  Drinking - the bar has an impressive list of tequila selections.  The house margarita is very good (and very strong).  Buffett fans will find references to songs and stories in the names of the drinks.  The wait staff is attentive and you never need to wait long for a refill.  Drinks are served in plastic to-go cups for your walk back to your hotel.  Dining - Like many other reviewers, we normally have the Volcano Nachos.  The serving is huge, probably enough for 3-4 people.  There are other items on the menu, but the nachos are so good, we have never had a reason to try anything else.  Plus, the food prices are very reasonable for the Strip.  We showed up around 10:00 pm on a Sunday and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  This is not abnormal at this time of night.  However, this was not a problem as there is a gift shop to browse and the Margaritaville casino (part of the Flamingo) is close by if you have a longer wait.   Overall, Margaritaville is a great place for fun, late-night dining in Las Vegas.  We will certainly be back on our next trip!",

It was as big as they describes it to be but the topping covered only about 1/3 of the chips and everything on the bottom were just plain and unsavory. Needless to say it was a disappointment. Then me and my girlfriend ordered their watermelon Margarita but it was too sweet and too strong for us. Then we tried to go for a birthday cake shot but it was covered in sugar as well. The service was good which is why I would give them 3 stars but the crowd is very casual and touristy which wasn't appealing to me. The inside of the restaurant was cute and the live band was good but their food and drinks are questionable and I would personally never go back again.",

    "text": "what an awesomely tacky and fun place.  the theme here is Some Sort of Tropical. there's a show at some point, involving pirates on stilts, a volcano, balloon hats, everyone clapping in unison, and a girl in a bikini in a dunk tank, none of which seem to make sense, but who cares?   I had the pulled pork sandwich on garlic toasted bread, which was actually pretty good, though the fries were standard.  the nachos: they are piled high and stacked with beans, cheese, meats, sour cream, and guac, and most definitely NOT microwaved. incredible stuff - and the 7 of us at the table were just able to finish them!  the drinks: our waiter actually advised against getting the giant ones because he said the ice melts too fast and dilutes it. myself and a few other people in our party had \"The Perfect Margarita\" which was described to us as \"pretty much just alcohol and lime juice\" and definitely did the trick. a little too much salt for my taste, but the alcohol helped block that out.  major props to our waiter (I think his name was John) - he was from Hoboken! - he actually was helpful with recommendations.  the price is not that bad actually. I think we each chipped in about $25-30.  thanks to this place \"Wasting Away in Margaritaville\" is stuck in my head. curse you, Jimmy.",

    "text": "I had dinner here when I was staying at the Flamingo... they're conveniently attached to each other.   It's a chain, in Vegas, attached to a hotel/casino so you can expect the prices to be slightly higher.  But it wasn't too too bad.  The nacho grande platter was great! We got 2 for the table and they were definitely the highlight of the food for us.  I got a burger that was good, not thrilling, but good.  The fries had nice seasoning.  And the bartender definitely knew how to pour a good, strong drink.    The atmosphere is very cool.  They had a few big screens playing random Buffett concerts and one of them was over a stage, so I assume on some nights they do some sort of live show.  Overall I had a very decent experience.  Nothing spectacular, but there were no glaring negatives either.",

    "text": "My husband and I got married in May, 2013 at the Garden Gazebo at the Flamingo Hotel, immediately followed by a three hour wedding reception at Margaritaville. We reserved the Clipper Room, which is an enclosed space with it's own bar, restrooms and a balcony, and has a $6000 minimum, which we easily surpassed with our 75 guests. Margaritaville offered many different dinner options, included both plated and buffet, but we chose to go with the buffet. Our original coordinator, Sara Ure, met with us a few months before, but was unavailable the week of the wedding, so Beth Wamsley had to pick up the whole thing, and she did an awesome job! Our manager on duty the night of the reception was Bryan, and he was fabulous! We had multiple guests take a moment to tell us how amazing the service was during our reception. Overall, wonderful.   For those brides to be looking for details: We got the a la carte buffet (pay per person, per dish, for example the mashed potatoes were $3/person), everything we choose was so delicious - apps were the baked apricot brie (so many compliments), and bacon wrapped shrimp. Dinner was tri tip (perfect, delicious), Caesar salad, chicken and artichoke pasta, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies. For dessert we chose a selection from the a la carte desserts - brownies, fruit tarts, chocolate mousse. It was all awesome. Overall I believe with food, tax, service charge for 75  guests we paid about $8,000.   They can do different table arrangements in the Clipper Room, and they will put table numbers on the tables for you. You can bring in your seating chart or  board the day before the wedding, and they will put it up for you on a table or easel - so, so helpful, thanks again to Beth for doing that! They will also set up a speaker and microphone for people to give speeches, if you want. We had the system ready to go, but since the music was playing and we don't like speeches much, anyway, we skipped it.",

HEAVEN. came with a side of yummy fries.   when we were there, they also had this show where pirates on stilts came out, starting blowing whistles, and i guess a \"margarita girl\" was dancing around and splashing around in a pool of margarita. i don't know, it was kinda weird, i couldn't really see it 'cause the sun was shining in my eye, and the whistles were kinda annoying. but the stilts were cool, i'll give them that.  this place was just way too loud though. i don't mind people talking, but when the music is blaring through the speakers and everyone's shouting to be heard, it can really mess up a meal. it makes it impossible to communicate with anyone.   i guess this place gets really busy though, 'cause it was reeeeeally hard to flag down our waiter. well, most of the time, we couldn't even find him!   i guess this place is just meh...good sandwich, but not something to go BANANAS over. you might want to stay away from the jambalaya though. from what i heard, it was kinda salty.",

    "text": "If you want a place where there's always a party going on, where they serve good food and great drinks, this is the spot! Every time we go to Vegas Margaritaville makes the cut as a \"go to\" place for at least one meal, without exception.  Yes, the wait can be lengthy but it never feels like it is as long as they say it is going to be, as there's plenty to do while waiting for the table to be ready. Shopping in the Margaritaville store, or even going those few extra steps into the casino at the Flamingo passes the time quite nicely. We have never had bad service at Margaritaville Cafe, quite the opposite in fact. If you're in a hurry they'll get you in and out, if you want to take a little more time they don't rush you through your meal.  About the music: If you are not a Parrothead you're not likely to get a whole lot out of the music. Most people who are unfamiliar with Jimmy's style don't get it, therefore they automatically say they don't like the music in the cafe. It is NOT country. Let me repeat that, Jimmy Buffett's music is NOT country. He has a style all his own, largely influenced by his love of all things Caribbean. His music has a rock/reggae/popish vibe Yes, he has collaborated on some songs with some of Nashville's biggest stars, but that is not his niche.  Lots of folks have indicated that this is not a good place for kids, I agree from the standpoint of why take a kid to Vegas (as a rule, I don't usually take my kids when I go). If I found myself down there with kids, however, I really think they would dig the Margaritaville Cafe. With everything going on in there as far as the volcano, the guys on stilts, the balloon animals, what kid wouldn't like that?  Heading down to Vegas in a few weeks, I'm thinking that the Margaritaville Cafe may end up being the first stop.",

They were OK at best. It is a place that is popular based on a song and the location is great as it is right across the street from the Ceasars Palace on the strip.

We shared some apps, wings were horrible, HORRIBLE.  The service was a complete mess.   Sorry Jimmy, I'll have to wait till I'm in Key West for another Cheeseburger in Paradise..",

I was just here last week and had my regular Uptown Margarita and the nachos which are amazing.  Actually I had three uptowns before I left late in the afternoon.  No problem, I was walking so the roads were safe.   My favorite spot is one of the up stair outdoor balconies which were not open this time but they have their own bars and you can look right over the strip and people watch.  You are right in the middle of the action in this place.  The menu is wide with many Caribbean items and the prices are actually better then most places on the strip.  I usually hit this place several times on my stay in town and I am never disappointed with the friendly service and great food and drinks.   I also always stop by the gift store next door and see what new cool things they have for myself and gifts.  Always thinking about Christmas.  :) For the best margaritas in town, this is as good as it gets!!!",

I like sitting upstairs on the outdoor deck where there's a great view of Bellagio and Caesar's. Perched at the far end of the bar under one of the \"misters\" with a big rum drink in hand is a small slice of Vegas heaven.  I ordered the loaded nachos \"appetizer\" with a friend on a recent visit and that ended up being our appetizer, dinner and dessert as the serving was easily larger than my head! Probably the best bargain on the menu in that it can easily feed 2-3 grown men.",

The food was good - not great - but solid. It was especially good after a long night of drinking. I didn't order any drinks but I did get an appetizer and a burger. Both were very tasty. But even now that I am thinking back on the meal I can't remember exactly what I ate. Not a good sign! But I do remember being full and happy when I left. The only downside is that our final bill came to over $50 and for two burgers, an app and no drinks, that was pretty crazy. I get that it's Las Vegas, but still, I was surprised! I would like to go back and try the drinks and see if they live up to the hype!",

The waiters & waitresses seem to be on crack but others might call it good customer service. In the scorching hot oven known as VEGAS this is a smart pit stop for sure.

    "text": "I love this place to start the night out!! Stopped in somewhat early to get the drinking festivities started and since it was a group of girls we decided to start with margaritas. The drinks are tasty and made with lots of fruity flavors, however, they could be somewhat stronger. We all had about 3 margaritas each but barely were feeling the buzz as we left.  I've also had the nachos, which are MASSIVE and can feed up to 4 people, easily.  The nachos are not the best or the worst but they will do the trick.  There's an hourly show that involves ship crew costumed entertainers on stilts and a mermaid that dives into a water tank - it's entertaining the first hour but if you're there for more than an hour you might get tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  We sat up in the bar area near the water tank and ended up getting splashed a few times from the water but we weren't bothered by it like some other people there were.  Of course, this was also 2 margaritas in so we were already focused on our mission and smiling from ear to ear.  The \"captain\" made me a balloon crown since it was my birthday which was super sweet of him and he even had a few dirty jokes that made us laugh...not sure if it was because they were actually funny or if it was just because it was awkward...but nonetheless we made memories, haha. The staff is very friendly and our waiter was a quirky guy who made us laugh the entire visit. I can't vouch for the rest of the menu so no idea on the food but the drinks are decent if you want to start your night off here to get a steady pace going.  The music is decent, not too many top 100 current hits playing but I was told there's sometimes a DJ in the later hours. Def a good time at least for one drink while in Vegas.",

Dani was our bartender and we ordered 2 drinks totaling $21.50 before taxes to get the free drink. She said we had to spend more than that and she talked to me as if I was stupid after I asked a question regarding the coupon then she went on to say 'I'm not going to argue with you' with the worst attitude after I asked her to the explain it again because our total was $21.50. I expected more and better customer service from this place that has so many good reviews, kinda bummed. Definitely not going back!

They also had a really terrible live band that was half actually singing and half what appeared to just pretending to preform while music blasted from the speakers. It was too loud for us to even talk over dinner so we just sat there all awkward-like. Not a good experience. The waiter couldn't even hear us either.

Fun atmosphere (not quiet if that's what you're looking for), fun little shows happening around you, girls swimming in giant vats of mixed drinks, and - oh yeah - good food!    My advice, if you're not a big eater, buy one item and split it. The serve good sized portions.  I am a big eater but could have stopped when 1/2 the sandwich was gone and been fine.   (Of course I didn't, and paid for it later).",

To go lid was cheap and cracked and probably will spill everywhere down the road. And the lights were flickering to the music almost giving me a seizure. Turkey burger was a tiny bit salty but I would be too if I was that turkey who sacrificed himself to become a burger. His family probably thought he was going to be served with gravy and mashed potatoes but he became a burger. They are probably apauled at us Americans making everything burgers. But who's to speak for the turkeys? But the atmosphere was nice it was like a beach/ dock themed thing without the annoying seagulls and blazing heat that will make you sweat an insane amount. Great place and food.",

We went and got an awesone table ordered our food and drink and were having a great time. That was until the bill came. It was double what it should have been. When my fiance questioned the waiter about it he immediately became defensive and rude. My fiance asked for the manager and he snapped at him and then took forever to get her. When the manager came to our tavle she was even ruder than the waiter was!  We explained to her that the waiter had completely explained their refillable blender cup wrong to us. She totally accused us of lying to get a cheaper bill and of trying to get free drink. All we wanted was to get the deal that the waiyer had promised us. She refused to honor what he said and again accused us of lying. Due to this waiter and the manager I will not plan on going to this place again. I will definitely take my business to other more deserving places on the Vegas strip!",

Every time I passed by, there were tons of drunk and loud people standing around with big huge tall glasses of alcoholic drinks.  (Sorry, I don't drink so I have no idea what they are, most likely Margaritas'.)  On top of that, I HATE places with loud music!  They do a little show where a girl slides into a BIG margarita glass pool.  They also have several guys on stilts walking around and making balloon 'art'.  (Quite entertaining for kids actually.)  Seriously, this is not my kind of restaurant!    When I got the $25 coupon in the mailer, I was going to just throw it away.  But then I thought, well, maybe, why not?  At worst, I just don't eat the food, right?  I am such a sucker for free food!     We ordered the Coconut Shrimps and BBQ Babyback Ribs.  Wow, to my surprise, they were EXCELLENT!  Big plump crunchy shrimps with sweet/spicy sauce.  The mash potatoe was really really good and the  vegetables were not bad, either.  I can't stand soggy vegetables and these were fine.    The Babyback Ribs were sooo tender they fell off the bones as you bite into them!.  You can choose one of the three BBQ sauce (South Pacific, Cilantro Pesto, or Guava BBQ).  I can't remember which one I had.  I just remember it was good!!!    The price may seem a little high, but portion is BIG!  With the $25 coupon and the rest on the Players card points, free food never tasted so good!    We had been back again since our first time and it was still good (and still free).",

(For example, one guy from Nebraska...  They've got slot machines right in the damn airport!)  This is Vegas.  Come on...  Most of the group was not ready for the price shock, so the first night in town we spent over two hours trying to find the steak and lobster special.  Then after the meal all I heard was \"that wasn't very good at all, and look how much they charged us for the alcohol!!\"  I wanted to get away from all that (it was almost every night).  Don't they learn from the first time?  Apparently not.  Having been to the Margaritaville in Orlando, I knew I would get great food here.  I didn't have to think about it, I just knew it would be.  It was.   I took The Deuce (greatest form of transportation in Vegas ever!) from my hotel to Margaritaville.  I knew there would be a wait, I expected to wait, and I figured I'd look around the shop or musclle up to the bar.  No biggie.  I was pleasantly surprised when the gal taking the stand-by reservation told me that there was a seat available up on the patio on the third floor.  Only a few people were up there because it felt like we were sitting at a bar on Mercury (until the sun went down behind Ceasar's...).  Best decision I ever made!  It wasn't long before the sun dropped below Ceasar's, and the bartender was friendly without trying to push me into anything other than conversation.   I ordered the jambalaya and it was awesome.  I washed it down with a Landshark on tap, and then the bartender had me try the Lone Palm Ale...  Wow!  And only available at Margaritaville, whereas Landshark is available down the street (still a good beer though).    After the sun went down, the patio turned lively and everyone up there just hung out.  It was one of those random moments that live in a memory.  Good times.",

I should have been a little wary of that . . .   The portobello-mushroom-burger-in-paradise (if you're a vegetarian Jimmy Buffet fan, of which I am only the former) was passable, the red bull margarita kept me going that night, but what really made it worth my while was the show and the spinning, scantily clad blonde on a fish hook.  She had some acrobatic moves, and how she spun around sitting on a slippery metal fish hook I'll never know, but she pulled it off.  Be careful of sitting next to the huge margarita, though, as you'll get a bit of a soaking when she slides down and gets dunked into the (reassuringly fake) giant margarita.",

My mother and I arrived on a Saturday night around 8 and waited somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes for a table, which is really not bad considering it was Saturday. I did not know this place was so huge, there are 3 floors! There is also a gift shop that we strolled through while waiting for our table, as well as talked to an employee there; they have men walking around on stilts, dressed in sailor costumes (think Popeye). That was entertaining enough. The huge margarita tubs behind the bar are cool to look at.  Anyway there is not too much to say. Our waiter was prompt despite a packed house, our food and drinks were good, the atmosphere is casual and I enjoyed the tv's everywhere playing the music video for whatever song happened to be playing on their playlist. It may be outdated but I still like watching music videos. I feel for the prices we should have gotten more food though; everything was good but the quantity did not match the prices. For the record we had a shrimp cocktail (Peel N Eat Shrimp), Coconut Shrimp, and the BBQ Pork Sandwich. No complaints about our food otherwise. I had a margarita which was good and I think my mom had a beer. It IS the Strip and we had fun so it's a give and take. Next time I will probably sit at the bar exclusively for drinks and maybe some appetizers. I'm not running back to Margaritaville but will be there again sometime.  I was really between 2 and 3 stars, and although the food was good it really can be found elsewhere, so that bumped it down to a 2 for me.",

Anyway, you have to get a margarita here, it's well known here. I had the red bull this time. Not bad. and not bad for the lady who celebrated her 80th birthday with her family and a shot that garnish well with whip cream looking like a penis. Boy, can she take it down. Everyone at the bar claps and laugh as she puts the whole thing in her mouth. Go Carol! Happy Birthday!  FYI, we had a server who could look like Terrel Owen's sister. I swear!",

They have a live band playing there that plays a good variety of music that appeals to everyone.  Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. After two I felt disgusting. Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group.   I considered this place my \"back up plan\" I wouldn't plan to go here first but if all my other plans fell awry I would be happy here.",

    "text": "I'm always a little nervous going to very busy places during a busy time of day because it's difficult to get good service when it's noisy and the staff are busy. This is especially important since I need to eat gluten free, and conveying that to waitstaff during the lunch rush is not easy. Add to that some iffy reviews from other gluten free people, and I was nervous enough to check ahead to make sure they could serve me. The most information I could get online were from other reviewers--nothing on their website about their ability to accomodate special dietary needs.  I was pleasantly surprised by the experience, however. While I did have to ask around before I found the place with the gluten free menues, it turned out I was just lost--they keep them up front where the hostess is. Also, our waitress was a little surprised at seeing me with the menu, but once I told her what it was she was like, \"Oh, right, of course.\" I ordered the BBQ burger off the gluten free menu, and she got the order perfect. It came out on a gluten free bun that was delicious. One of friends that was with me tried it and she confirmed that it is a very good bun. She is not gluten free, and ordered the same thing with the regular bun, so you can believe me when I tell you it was good. It didn't have the spongy or dry texture that some gluten free buns get. It was soft and fluffy, it held together nicely, and it wasn't too dense or too thick. It turns out they have a dedicated industrial bakery that makes these exclusively for this restaurant, which is unfortunate because they're delicious and would be great to stash in my freezer.  The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is that it seemed like the waitstaff don't get many gluten free customers, so this was a bit unfamiliar. On the plus side, our waitress did remember once she thought about it a second, and she did get my order right, and I had a wonderful burger with no ill side-effects whatsoever. This alone didn't push my review down to 4 stars, but in combination with other things, I can't in good faith give this a whole-hearted recommendation to other gluten free diners.   What would have really pushed this to five stars is if the website had specific information about their ability to handle gluten free orders, and if the menu integrated the substitutions and omissions required to make items gluten free, rather than having them listed on a separate sheet. After all, the descriptions are on the main menu, and then the accommodations are on the separate gluten free menu, so I had to keep looking back and forth. Most of the accommodations would be easy to mark with a footnote like they do for vegetarians--no island butter or island rice, and substitute a gluten free bun. Additional information could be provided on the website to help other people like me decide whether they even want to bother trying a place like this. My first instinct, after seeing the website was to pick another place to go, but I don't know Las Vegas well enough to offer up a good suggestion, so I kept digging for information and found enough info to be willing to give it a try. Someone less inclined to dig for more information might give up much faster and take their whole party with them elsewhere.  Ultimately, if you eat gluten free and are willing to deal with the noise level of the restaurant, you can find something to eat here. If you are also allergic to other things, you might have to spend some more time trying to get relevant information, but it is likely out there if you are willing to dig.",

My friend was visiting from out of town and I am a local but I don't mind going to places on the strip if it is worth it. This place is not. The music was loud and the show of dancing guys on stilts making animal balloons did not impress me. My friend got the island pork wrap and said it was ok but not worth coming back for. This service was ok but not great.",

Gotta love a place with more than one bar, a dance floor, restaurant, and a store... so much going on!   The live band was good and played a wide variety of music.. there weren't too many people gettin down on the dance floor though, but once we got the drinks rolling it was a good time!    They have this weird lil game right before you walk into the store with a metal ring on a cord... I can't get it to work to save my life...   The store has so much cute stuff I found it necessary to blow some money in there too =)  Saw a guy passed out in one of the adirondack chairs in the hallway... take note, do NOT sit in a really low adirondack chair if you are wearing a skirt/dress... bad idea!   Funniest thing is, I hate tequila, we are not friends but I had a great time here anyway!  Definitely check it out!",

The waiter gave us a table that apparently was still in use. I guess they went to the restroom, left their box to go on the table (but left a tip). When they came back and saw my friend and me sitting there they were pissed (as they should've been). Then, as we were seated, we watched groups of college kids walk out of the waiting line, up to a table with a waiter nearby and ask to sit... and the waiter cleaned the table for them! It was like a group of 6! I felt so bad for everyone else who'd been standing in line.  As for our service and food, it was great! I got the veggie burger that's made with peas, corn, carrots, broccoli, edamame and bell peppers. It was insanely good and one of the most unique burgers that I've ever had. The food was reasonably priced but I felt like their \"house margarita\" was a bit expensive when compared to their fancy margaritas, so I opted for a water instead. Both my friend and I were happy with our food.",

She was quick to get drink orders started and out to the table. Our food orders didn't take long either. Our waitress was constantly at the table to make sure we had everything we needed.   I went with a drink called Tranquil Waters and it was a delicious drink. My husband had the Zombie and he really enjoyed his drink as well. I know Margaritaville has a large emphasis on the drinks and I wasn't disappointed with the variety of options or quality of the drinks.  For food that night we had Volcano Nachos and Crispy Coconut Shrimp. The Volcano Nachos were huge. I think four or five of us shared this order and we still didn't finish it. The toppings were loaded on and it was a good bar food dish. The Coconut Shrimp was better than I expected and had a sweet and spicy sauce for dipping. The fries served with it were typical.",

    "text": "4 of us came here cause we liked the atmosphere and wanted to have some good food, our waitress Pamela had the personality of a thumbtack, she was so put out, we waited 20 min for water, and over an hour for our food, it arrived cold, she never came out as someone else brought the food, we couldn't find her whatsoever, finally a nice manager walked by and we told her the situation, she told us Pamela wasn't feeling well ( as a business owner if my employees treated customers like this they would be fired, however she should of went home) but in a nut shell the manager brought back warm food and filled our waters, Pamela then walked by and she said u good? We said your manager helped ups, she pretty ignored what we said and walked away, so we didn't leave her a tip cause she didn't earn one from both parties, and honestly if your gonna work in a very busy environment you need to have a great attitude and like your job /people, if you don't then get out of there and done make others miserable with you! In closing I want to strongly say I will not return to Margaritaville in the near future as I frequent Las Vegas strip, I hope this helps others with making a decision to eat at Margaritaville  But the food wasn't bad just the service",

    "text": "A disappointment for sure.  No sweet tea - I mean, I was pretty sure ol' Jimmy was a Southerner at one point.  And the music was a mix of a little JB and then some pop music that I didn't recognize and some other stuff I didn't know either.    Staffing was light as it was New Year's Eve so it took about eight minutes for our server to come over and get our drink order.  Jared was completely personable and a nice guy.    It was mid-afternoon so we chose to split an order of the Volcano nachos.  It seemed like a huge portion, except after we ate the top layer of nachos, it was all just plain chips.  I think this may be a vegetarian option as there didn't seem to be any meat involved with the chili that was on it.    Also, The Dog ordered 5 o'clock somewhere cocktail.  Tasty enough but the first one didn't come with the pineapple garnish but it did have a bit of orange and a cherry.  The second one didn't come with any garnish at all until we asked.  Then it was the orange, not pineapple as pictured.  When we asked about that, Jared went and retrieved some pineapple slices in a cup.  And it was all served in a plastic cup, for God's sakes, though the menu shows it in a nice tall glass.  Disappointing.  We did not want to try the \"homemade\" key lime pie so we got our check and left.",

The hostess didn't welcome us, just told us that it was a 15 minute wait. I get that it sucks to work on Saturday, but she really didn't want to be there. She passed us off to another host (who also looked like she didn't want to work on Saturday) who didn't greet us and sat us down without saying a word. The food? It took a while for me to get my order. When it came, the eggs were the only thing hot. The pancakes were hard, the toast was soggy, the bacon was cold. Didn't finish my meal. Sad, because I am a really generous tipper and leaving no tip really sucks. Having worked in the food service industry, I know how hard a job serving is. In a weekend where we had great service everywhere else in Vegas, this place was disappointing.",

Every so often, they also put on a fun show with dancing and a young lady dressed in a bikini popping out of a volcano and then sliding down a water slide into a big margarita glass filled with water! Maybe not the best place for younger kids but we all had a good time.",

    "text": "Great Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere...  Crazy right? A chain like Margaritaville has great food, great service and a great atmosphere? NO really - if you visit this chain restaurant the hospitality won't disappoint.    It was our first night in Las Vegas, as were walking around and looking for something to eat we came across Margaritaville.. I wanted to try this when we were in Key West but my hubby wouldn't let us... So I won this argument..   We came inside, which had a different seating process. (You visit the hostess, who prints out a name and table, take this to the dinning room, where one of the staff members will seat you) Upon being seated we were greeted warmly by our waiter who took our drink orders and appetizer. Shortly after he arrived with our drink orders and promptly took our dinner order.   Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip - this was brought out in a piping-hot plate with warm tortilla chips, and topped with some grated Romano and Parmesan cheese. It was quite good, I couldn't complain because we've had some really crappy spinach and artichoke dips. It was quite flavorful and hot. (they got the basics)  Dinner: We had the Mixed Fajitas (Chicken and Steak) - which came out on a sizzling platter topped with vegetables (onions, carrot, etc), a plate of warm tortillas, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side. THIS MEAL IS BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO - trust me on that ( we didn't even finish it) The great thing about these Fajitas was that the meat and veggies weren't just thrown on the grill and cooked... They were actually seasoned - not overly seasoned but just right.  The waiter was great - I asked him if he knew any hookah bars in the area and he even went and asked other servers and staff (wrote it down on paper and gave it to us)   Atmosphere: The the atmosphere was great, its a great fun place to visit - they even had a DJ on the stage playing some great songs (mix of both country, hip-hop, and even pop).",

She really hustled, given how busy it was. My friend went with a beer to start, and I went with the 5 o'clock Somewhere. This drink was the perfect combo of rum, tequila and pineapple juice!  I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and friend ordered the Cheeseburger in Paradise. Both were yummy and a great value for the price. We had our meals and 2 drinks each. Attempted to order key lime pie, as the waitress suggested dessert and I'm a sucker for key lime pie, but sadly they were out.

The outdoor patio with water misters and umbrellas is a nice place to hang out and watch the craziness of The Strip pass you by.  Also enjoyable is the inside Tiki bar with lots of sitting room and plenty of games close at hand. The theme of this joint is perfect for Vegas. May as well stop in and have a marg just to say you did.  I was a bit put off by the fact that I had to wander through the Flamingo to find the rest rooms but it was a good walk which burned off some of the booze. It's not inexpensive for a marg but it's well worth the money.  The gambling seemed decent but I was more in the mood to hang out here on my last visit. It's a great place to kill time with some strong drinks. Not once did I hear Jimmy Buffet which was a gift and a disappointment. Next time...maybe.",

Not to mention their house margaritas are fabulous. You should try to sit in one of the boats, that is super fun.   We started off with Asiago Crab Dip and substituted chips instead of bread, we all loved the taste and texture. Then I chose the Carne Asada Steak tacos for dinner. They had pico de gallo, cheese and cilantro on them. I ate every bite... So yummy! I tasted a few different items that my family choose and my favorite was the Seafood Mac and Cheese. Wow, simply divine!   The service is adequate for a restaurant of this size and all the entertainment going on around you. Just prepare to wait a bit and enjoy the surroundings. The food will not disappoint you and just keep the drinks coming. Who doesn't like Jimmy Buffet? He is a legend and his restaurant will amaze you.",

First off, parking at Flamingo sucks. Call me spoiled but, I guess, I'm used to bigger lots and stalls. It was kind of scary looking for parking in such a compacted space.  Second, it was a pain to walk to the restaurant because it's so far from the parking lot. We had to walk through the whole casino and then, through Margaritaville Casino....yes, they have their own casino!  As soon as we walked in, I was surprised at how big this place was. Friends that we were meeting said that it's THREE stories tall. WOW, doesn't seem that big from the street.  It was very busy as it was Saturday night but, we found a seat by the bar area. The waiter was friendly and recommended some drinks for us to start with. I ended up getting the License to Chill...it was such a pretty blue when I got it. Very refreshing AND strong so, that was a bonus!  The taco salad my friend got was huge and, shockingly, didn't seem that fattening. More refreshing than anything. My crab, shrimp, and mushroom dip was good. Came with garlic bread but, I liked it better with chips. Btw, the garliv bread was more like garlic Texas toast =)",

I'd actually never been to Margaritaville. I will say that the \"Perfect Margarita\" was good - strong, pure lime juice, agave and semi-guilt free. The queso had nothing on real Texas queso, but the salsa was good. Other menu items weren't too intriguing - they have fish tacos but your only option is beer-battered. I settled on the grilled chicken which was pretty plain Jane.   I will say the best part of the experience - other than the 'ritas and odd people-watching - was our service from Ryan L. He brought out the drinks fast - even one on the house as he noticed our bride was crying tears of joy - and even split our checks without our party even requesting that. (And that's the only restaurant in Vegas that did it. Not even the top-dollar restos would accommodate.)",

However; my last visit earlier this year was a little disappointing.  Volcano was not working, employees did not seem to have that excitement or fun to be working there attitude I have been used to.  Even the menu has changed in the past year.. What!! No more Jamaican Jerk Wings????  It's Margaritaville for crying out loud!! I even asked about access to their top roof bar and one employee stated the section was permanently closed.  I'm not much of a business man and to be fare, I not privy to the full details on the reason for this, but in my opinion, a roof top bar is always a plus in Vegas and killer revenue generator.  In the past, the roof top bar at Maragaritaville has always been great for \"Al-Fresco dinning, view of the Vegas strip, and people watching while enjoying a perfect margarita.  Maybe making the roof top bar a primary seating section and the main floor secondary could be an option?  I really hope there are plans to bring some or all of the original ambiance back to this place as it would be a shame to go away. Never the less, I will be back in Vegas this summer and yes... Margaritaville will still be one of my stops just because I am a boat drunk too..",

Every time my cousins and I come to Vegas we always try to stop at get the \"Volcano Nachos\" well today happened to be the day. keep in mind we have been stoping here for the last god knows how many years to just get the nachos and drinks one beers. However, the \"volcano nachos\" arrived to our table looking quite empty. Seems like all we got were a bunch of chips a scoop of chili meat and it was blah.... I remember this appetizer being a lot more filling and worth the $18.00. My nephews were even disgusted with how it tasted and kids love nachos. I'm very very disappointed that a Vegas tradition has finally reached its end. In addition to that we our salad came at the very end of the dinner but our server was very nice and removed it from our bill.",

With such a large group it was difficult to decide on a place to eat prior to the show.  We decided to leave a couple hours early for the show and play it by ear once we got to the hotel. As luck would have it, there was a Margaritaville right next store to the Linq hotel.  We were worried with such a large group and no reservation; they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. The staff did an excellent job of putting together a nice table on the bar side for our group.  Our waitress was on top of everything from the start. Drinks to appies to dinner to dessert, everything was perfect without error. She even split our bill up for us so there was no confusion in calculating what everyone owed.  My wife and I split the Pretzel Sticks. I enjoyed those very much. For my main, I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise. I have to say I was a little disappointed as there didn't seem to be a lot of flavour in the burger. I also had the fries with it and wished I had gone with the sweet potatoes instead. They were actually pretty good, from what I stole off my wife's plate!  I also have to say is it was very loud. The longer we stayed and the more people that arrived for dinner and drinks, the crazier it got. That's to be expected when you're seated in the bar side of the restaurant. I bet this place is nuts after 10:00 pm!  Thank you to restaurant and staff for fitting us in on such short notice!",

Unacceptable, but at this point I'm not even surprised.   This place took a dive over the past few years.   Rolled in at noon hungover on a Saturday for a quick lunch, ordered the acclaimed $18 'volcano nachos'. It was a plate of Tostitos with a couple jalapenos on it. Okay, not like it used to be, whatever good hang out spot, I'll live. I asked for a side of salsa, assuming our server forgot it. She said that I have to pay $4 for a side of salsa. Are you kidding me?? Dry chips with minimal toppings and NOTHING to dip it in included. So I asked her if it came with anything, she said no sides included, basically shut the conversation down.   Still baffled by what I heard, I grabbed a busser passing by, asked him for a side of salsa. He said no problem. Our server ended up bringing a tiny side of salsa. Cool at least I got that. I sarcastically asked her if I was getting charged for it, she said yes no sides are free. $2 for a individual dipping size salsa, $4 for a small bowl. I told her to take it back, then she proceeded to argue with me, telling me I already ordered it. Wow. Asked for a manager, explained the situation and terrible service, he did not even budge, still wanted me to pay for the salsa. I sent the food back and left.   They know they will still get the business, but not mine ever again.",

I had the refreshing Blueberry pomegranate margarita.  Served tall and on the rocks.  I love the classic margarita served here, but thought I try something new, I was glad I did.  My dad tried the Last mango in Paris and we both agreed it was also worth the try.  I wasn't supper hungry so I had the Corn and crab chowder.  Nice and thick with corn and crab, with a nice heat to it.  Very comforting and filling.  I shared the Asiago crab dip to just have a little something on the side of the chowder and it was a perfect complement. It was also filled with crab and the top had a wonderful crispy crust.  My Dad went the opposite direction and was quite hungry and did the  license to grill.  To which he ate in silence.  He just dug in and enjoyed the combination of sausage, chicken, ribs and something else I'm sure.  He didn't finish it all, but took some home and they made sure he had enough bbq sauce to take home cause that's some of the best part.  We are Parrotheads so we will also stop by, but whether we just drink or eat always depends on the quality of our experience, and each year we have had wonderful service, great food, and great great.  So until next time Fins Up!",

It's a great place to take kids with it's live entertainment and sensory-overload interior (bright lights, loud music, boat and airplane props). The margaritas are good and some of the appetizers and sandwiches are tasty, but nothing too special. Most of the menu items are typical bar food. I tried the mahi-mahi. I should have known better. It was a little on the dry side. You would probably be better off sticking to one of the sandwiches. My kid loved the kids menu which also doubles as a mask and the chicken tenders and fries he got were better than expected. Overall, it's a good place to eat for the price you pay.",

The best kept secret is the bar and seating upstairs and outside.  It is a little disappointing that it seems to be closed a lot, but enjoyable to watch the zombies stroll throughout the strip. The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas standards and good quality.  Must try the cheeseburger in paradise, but the fish sandwich is best on the menu.  You can always eat at the bar, which is a great place to hang out.  The \"volcano/margaritaville\" show at night is a fun little period that helps to convey the carnival like atmosphere.  I take everyone who comes to visit me to Margaritaville.  A must stop for Vegas.  Its is also connected to the link, which makes it extra cool.  Enjoy the Buffet music.  Parrotheads enjoy!",

Immediately, the talentless drummer began grating on my nerves, and I reluctantly took a chair, feeling a touch claustrophobic due to the slung ceilings and thinking that there is nothing sadder than a group of desperate people trying really hard to party to the sounds of an atrocious band. As a piercing buzzer triggered a series of flashing lights, a lithe dancer suddenly shot from the volcano in the middle of the tacky restaurant and flowed like lava down the structure, finally splashing into a large margarita blender filled with neon liquid. As the band then broke out into a Journey medley, I gnashed my teeth, shoved several nacho chips in my mouth (which were nicely coated with beans and cheese), and ordered a couple of tequila shots from our willing server. Mollified by the seductive heat of the liquor, I finally roused my companions from their seats and headed back to the Strip. Never again, Margaritaville.",

Today our experience was more exceptional than usual. We had a bartender named Jon, if you ever come, find him at the bar, he's super friendly, knows all the Vegas hot spots and makes for a super fun experience! I highly recommend this place to anyone. They have great skinny margaritas and an awesome drink called the habana banana (I think thats what it was called!)",

I feel as if Vegas brings nothing but mental and physical exhaustion for me. I was so tired on the day of our arrival, i didn't even put the whole Jimmy Buffet theme together until a pirate on stilts walked by me.  Decent 'ritas ( I liked the top shelf margarita myself) and the food was plentiful and comforting.  I was a little disoriented by the large Mr. Buffet or occasional Jack Johnson towering above me on television screens, but it was the \"chick on a hook\" that dropped down into the Megarita behind me that really caught me by surprise.  The men were happy with the location choice, but I could see other females around me not so impressed with the \"bleach blond in a bikini on a fish hook\" almost twirling her way into my burger buns. I'd probably come here to get drunk fast, but it's really not my kind of joint unless surrounded by an equally drunk and silly group of people. It's definitely Vegas, very chill and encourages one to keep on drinking.",

Yes they carry the brand of their very own Margaritaville tequila. Good marketing concept. But tequila drinkers know that tequila should not be infused with sweet artificial flavors of coconuts, lime, oranges, etc....This place invites the smell and sounds of the islands. Ok the ghetto part. Where the stale beer lingers and the smell of sweat and suntan lotion lingers.  As far as the food is concerned ok you gotta think typical bar/restaurant tropical cliche.... Uhm who has crab cakes? Ohhhh how original. \"Yea the crabcakes are soooo goooood\" bleh bleh Wings - got wings? Ohhh yea wow..wings..... What about coconut shrimp...?  OH YEA THE COCONUT SHRIMP! Wow Fantastic...yea...... Well I had apps and they really weren't bad....because they were like costco brand. Maybe I'm just not impressed anymore and I need something more original? Maybe it's just overpriced and I'm bitter because the tequila is not that high quality and I need something with uhmph!",

They have a little patio that overlooks the strip...I'd recommend it for some great people watching.  The downside:  we were seated at a boat.  Yes.  A. Boat.  But this boat did NOT have a good view of the ocean, and it was so dark, I could barely see my menu.  Try and sit at a non-boat if you can :)  You'll be closer to the stage and more \"in the action\" The upside:  I had a great bowl of blue crab & corn chowder.  Seriously, this was one of the best soups I've ever had.  Rest of the food was just ok.  I was disappointed with my margarita.   You'd think ordering one here would be a no brainer, but it was small and tasted mass produced.   Overall: Fun, loud place that you can come to with a group of your rowdy friends and not spend too much $.  Great location on the strip, you don't have to walk through a giant hotel.",

Shredded cheddar and jack on top of a mild chili mix of ground beef and stewed tomatoes, sour cream, guac, tomatoes, and jalapenos.  Only thing I DIDN'T like was the fact that there weren't enough toppings to go around.  By the time you get to the middle of your \"volcano\" there are only nacho chips left with nothing to scoop.  We sat in the bar area because table seating was a 15 minute wait.  Pretty good bloody marys.",

The server I had, while a seasoned server - was surprisingly inept with a large group. No refills, VERY VERY slow food service and she must have put the order in wrong as the food runners started delivering to the wrong people and then just started calling out meals. There were fajitas, burgers, wings, etc on the table and she didn't bring any extra napkins or make a trip over to see how we were doing. So the service was eh, so I got my own napkins and refilled my own iced tea - was the food good? Yeah the food was good, I had the turkey burger and it was full of flavor and goodness.

The drinks are crazy overpriced for the 1. Size and 2. Alcohol content and the food left A LOT to be desired.  The food was cheep and everyone left with stomach aches.  The place is super loud as others have said and their entertainment consists of people on stilts and a girl who dives into a blender...I guess I should use the word \"entertainment\" loosely.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I would though recommend the bar inside the Margaritaville casino - the It's 5 o'clock somewhere bar.  The bartenders have mad drink skills from the varieties of drinks they offer to the cocktails like show they put on while making your drink.  Just made me feel a little better paying $10 for a house margarita and $7 for a Corona.  If you are on the strip looking for a good, diner style place to eat go to the Peppermill down by Circus, Circus.  It'll save not only your digestive tract but also keep some of those dollars in your wallet!",

Friendly and efficiently, I was led directly to the bar, where the bartender was right there to fulfill my every frozen margarita need. He recommend several, and I sat there and drank three so quickly I got instant brain freeze. His suggestions were well worth it, and my craving for frozen alcohol was satisfied. Prices were decent for Vegas, not cheap by any means, but not outrageous as poolside ritas would have been. I don't think I'd come here for food, as there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, but when in need of a quick refreshing frozen rita, I'll be right back at Margaritaville.",

Waited for almost an hour but were told we could still get breakfast which ended at 11 because we checked in before 10:30am. Were sat at 11 and ordered breakfast. Waited another half hour. When they brought the food, the hollandaise sauce was on it and I had asked for it on the side. So they took it back. Waited fifteen minutes for them to re-do it. When they brought it the second time, the eggs were so overcooked, it was like having two hard boiled eggs sitting on an english muffin. I asked for the manager who promptly came over. When I showed her that the eggs were overcooked, she said she didn't know if they could remake it because breakfast was over, but she'd try. Huh? Isn't she the manager? Can't she tell them what to make? It was clear the eggs had been made in advance and sitting there under heat lamps for a while. We waited another twenty minutes. By this time, my fiance's done with his meal and just sitting and waiting for mine to come. The manager finally comes back with a freshly made eggs benedict which was good and tells us she'll comp the whole meal. So kudos to her for taking care of it properly, but it took way too long for us to get to that point. Would have much rather just paid for the meal and been able to actually eat together.",

We were stepping into the restaurant just moments before closing. We were pretty sure we would again be turned away, with a \"sorry, no food, but you can drink here\". Instead, a young man named Dave informed us that he would be closing the kitchen in a few minutes, and wanted to make sure we would have an opportunity to order before that happened. He took our order, and served us! His people skills are awesome, the food was great, and service was awesome. If I owned a restaurant, I would most certainly make Dave the Restaurant Service Manager!",

When we started doing this, a blonde middle aged woman was extremely rude and clearly pissed. Lucky for us, she was our server. I'd tell you her name, but she didn't introduce herself. She immediately chose to be disrespectful. She told us I'll be with you in a few minutes and I kid you not, she stood in the corner yawning and glaring at us. We literally got up and left after about 10 minutes. She started laughing as we got up. I have never experienced such an unpleasant human being. This woman was nasty.

You get some entertainment while you're here.  Once the song \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" comes on the party starts.  All the excitement last about 15 minutes.

This was a completely different experience all together.  We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait for a table.  Our server took our order and brought us drinks and then vanished on his break.  We saw runners bring food out and not able to figure out who's it was.  They then asked the bartender and he put the food on his back shelf and there it sat...I don't know how long b/c it was still there when we left.  Our food took FOREVER to come out.

They had two whites listed on the drink menu, but were \"out of\" both of them. (When I saw a woman at the next table drinking a red wine out of a plastic cup I thought, thank god they are out of the white! They can't even trust the clientele with glassware!) So I asked for a Red Stripe, also on the menu. Nope, none of that, either. I was finally able to get an Amstel Light.  I had nachos. Chips heading toward stale and cold. Plastic cheese sauce, grisly beef, flavorless guacamole. We shared fajitas at the the table. The meat was cold, the beef was barely cooked, the rice had no seasoning. I couldn't wait to leave.

My second visit was much better.  We went there for lunch and sat on the rooftop area.  The view was excellent, the Margaritas were fantastic and the atmosphere in general screamed Carribean vacation.  It was what I was looking for the first visit.  I think the key is to go when you can sit out on the rooftop and soak in the rays.  It likely helps them sell more Margaritas that way too!",

Let me start off by saying this is a great dive bar kind of place with the whole margaritaville theme with boats and stuff but the food is highly overpriced when it comes the quality. Expect your typical chain restaurant food.. nachos, burgers, wings, etc. If you're into that kinda stuff then this is the place for you, but if you're looking for authentic flavors and a unique day bing experience keep it moving...  I will say if you want to check out the restaurant without eating there, just ask and they'll let you.",

    "text": "I want to say first that the best part of my experience at this restaurant was my waitress, Marcie, who was all smiles and positive vibes all throughout the night. She refilled our drinks constantly, checked up on us to see how we were enjoying our meals, and was kind enough to take a photo for us at dinner. Unfortunately, This place was a miss for the family and me, a bit of a disappointment but somewhat satisfied our stomaches after a long night of walking up and down the Vegas Strip.   Ambiance and atmosphere get some acknowledgement, the restaurant is decked out in lots of marine decor (boats, fishing polls, fish...etc) which includes tv screens throughout the place playing music videos. Presentation of the food makes this place a total catfish though because while many of the menu items sounded and looked delicious upon arrival, they lacked extremely in regards to taste (Which is very important at a restaurant, I came here to eat good food not look at food).  The Fried Chicken Tenders were alright, they came with fries that were mediocre and the batter or crust used to fry the chicken fingers didn't have them looking or tasting very appetizing. The chicken fingers looked very similar to corn dogs and tasted super similar to funnel cake, yikes. I don't know about anyone else but when I order chicken tenders, I'm looking for a more crunchy and crispy feel to them on the outside and juiciness on the inside.   The Jerk Salmon paired with spinach and white rice was alright, the salmon was cooked well but the \"jerk\" part of the \"jerk salmon\" was just some (lousy) tasting BBQ  sauce that looked like they just threw it on the salmon and it tasted nothing like jerk. When I cut a piece of my salmon to eat, the sauce just fell off the piece which might have been a blessing in disguise since the flavor was off putting anyway, I ended up scraping it off to be honest.  The Coconut Shrimp was very delicious BUT the \"coconut ranch\" sauce they pair the shrimp with was honestly awful - It tasted more like a salty ranch than coconut/ranch combination and ruined the dishes potential. I highly recommended you visit Red Lobster instead of this place if you want a delicious coconut shrimp and coconut sauce combo.  The Shrimp Scampi Linguine came with more linguine than shrimp , maybe only 5 shrimps hidden under a mass of linguine.   Overall, this place was not awful but closer to average and perhaps saying even that is pushing it. After a long night of walking, drinking and seeing shows on the Vegas Strip I guess this place is alright. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here, I'm not going to suggest this place to my friends when they visit Vegas and I certainly would never willingly come to the restaurant again - In the words of Simon Cowell , \" It's a NO from me\".  But special shout out to Marcie! Thanks for the great vibes.",

They have a good burger, not a flat tasteless patty like some of these chains. Atmosphere is always hopping, good music playing and videos overhead. Fries are good and well, the margaritas are awesome.  Don't get the house, get the top shelf one, you won't be disappointed!  I love them and usually end up having a few.   Only disappointing thing is the volcano doesn't seem to work anymore. Used to erupt and fill the blenders, they still play the music but no volcano of margaritas.",

When we walked in and asked the hostess what stairs we take to the rooftop she acted like we were bothering her (she was having a conversation with another employee).   When we did find our way to the rooftop, I will say the view is great to people watch, but good luck in getting a drink! I stood in line for over 15 minutes for 2 drinks and the bartender was not nice. I did not even bother trying to get another drink as the line and attitude I got where not anything I wanted to deal with.   We thought about ordering food but then were told they do not have food service on the rooftop.. Well that makes no sense.    Not in any rush to go back on our next Vegas excursion.",

We were starving and not willing to walk too far so we opted for Margaritaville because they had a sign outside saying they had breakfast from 8am-11am.   We knew we'd be eating throughout the day so we split a steak and eggs. We asked for medium rare but really for $18 I wasn't expecting much. The steak came out well done and a little on the thin side but hey you get what you pay for. The meal itself was your normal steak, eggs, has browns, and toast.   All in all, this is a great place to go if you were too busy getting plastered next door at 5 o'clock somewhere and need food or risk a gnarly empty stomach hangry syndrome.",

Fun location, but in comparison to the other places I went to in Vegas, I couldn't give 5 stars.   Over all service was good for such a large group. It's a fun place to visit....but you'll have to try some of the other places also.",

I was on vacation with some friends and we were looking for the ideal breakfast spot. Being that we're from NY, or body time clock is completely thrown off. Walking down the strip, we saw Margaritaville, and since we know the name from other places, we decided to try the breakfast! The Key West Breakfast platter was to die for. Crabmeat, shrimp, eggs, spinach and the drizzle of hollandaise was amazing! Although we just had mimosas, Jeff made the experience. Charismatic, attentive, understanding, and commutative were just SOME of his traits. Needless to say, we were astonished and overly content with the service and professionalism from this establishment. Food, drinks, and service was AMAZING! Thank you from a Vegas Virgin! 5 Star Service!",

I had never played before and thoroughly enjoyed it!!

We had 5 o'clock Somewhere which was a strong drink that I'd recommend if you're looking to get tipsy quickly. We followed that up with Don't Stop the Carnival. This was perfect for my taste for sweet drinks and was my favorite of the night. Next was Alaskan Amber which was a dark beer with great flavor and almost no aftertaste. We shared the appetizer trio which was great and could have served as a meal in itself. My favorite was the egg rolls with spicy dipping sauce followed by extra crispy chicken tenders. For dinner, who could resist a cheeseburger in paradise. They were loaded up and difficult to eat without everything sliding off. The fries served with it were average. If you're looking for good island drinks, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking for above average food, this probably isn't the right stop for you.",

At any rate, we had a lack lustre experience here last night. The host and hostesses all seemed apathetic. Same with our waiter.  The food was a shell of its former self. The portions have gotten much smaller.   We got the club, a burger, taco salad, and fried chicken salad. The burgers and sandwiches used to come with heaping piles of fries. We ALWAYS had to leave with to-go boxes. Last night we finished everything, and we weren't even that hungry. The food was just sad looking. The burger and fries were cold.  My order got messed up. No big deal. It happens. But when they brought me the incorrect order, I reiterated the rest of my order, and the server got shirty and short and simply said \"That was already correct.\" However, they did bring out the correct order very quickly, which I was very appreciative for.   The atmosphere in here just wasn't great. It used to be fun. Great music, lights, fun and friendly staff, great food including some of the best burgers on the strip. I hope they are able to get this train back on the tracks.",

Walked and got seated right away which was odd at first because there was always a wait for this place and we came on 4th of July. Well we got our drinks and appetizers and then we never saw our waitress again. She never came back to refill drinks and forgot to put in our food order which we found out 30 minute later after we asked her for the bill because the service was so poor. The restaurant wasn't busy and that was the worst service we ever had here. It's a True shame because we've come here so long and the service was poor and shocking. Avoid this place now if you can the service has gone way down and a upsetting experience overall.",

Our friends were already there and my girlfriend and I needed to eat. The waiting line wasn't that long, we waited maybe ~15 minutes.   We were quickly hustled to one of the tables that luckily overlooked the Strip. We sat down, and took a quick glance at their short breakfast/brunch menu all before our waiter came by. Both of us decided on a fun and fruity brunch drink and the general breakfast platter of eggs/sausage/toast/potatoes.   Figured it wouldn't take long since they were turning tables over quickly. Wasn't the case at all. It was a struggle to find our server once he took our order, he just kind of disappeared. Other servers took care of us (food and drink delivery, water refills, etc) and no one had an explanation for his disappearing act. Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but we must've waited a good 30-45 minutes AFTER that for food. We received no apology nor explanation for the delay. That would've been nice.   The drinks were nice and the food was bland. Overall it could be summed up as a \"blah\" experience.",

I had a taco salad or something like that and it was underwhelming with the center lettuce being quite soggy and cold.... not in a cold crisp way, but in a not tasty way.",

I thought they would pass our table by but I was glad when they stopped by.   For dinner I had the ribs and french fries, a common thing that I order a touristy spots, and it was a good choice.

But instead, they took our reservation and we showed up on time.  Unfortunately, they told us they only had room for half of us upstairs and half downstairs.  Not because there was not enough room for 40 but because they hadn't set aside enough tables in one location for 40.  We seated as many people as we could together and as tables near us opened up we kept adding them to our group, one by one.  Very disappointing.    I ordered the steak & shrimp fajitas and received steak & chicken.  They told me to keep the chicken and brought me out the shrimp, which was supposed to be \"grilled\" (according to their menu) but looked as if it had merely been heated up, not grilled.  These are probably the worst fajitas I've ever had.  But I will give it to them - they make great margaritas.",

Unfortunately I didn't try their famous margaritas because I was running on 2 hours of sleep, but I did try their Jamaican Jerk Chicken dish. Surprisingly it was decent and juicy. Not the BEST chicken, but decent enough. The sauce was on the side (not smothered) and was tasty.   On my next visit, I wanna try the volcano nachos!

As people walked through the aisle of our table area, I was repeatedly \"bumped\" which was very annoying throughout the dinner. We ordered a tower of margarita which tasted like sweet and sour infused with salt. They provided us one shot of extra tequila to share and add to our individual margaritas but the drink was still horrible!!!! Out of 9 women, no one drank more than a few sips of their drink which was a complete waste of $65! We waited a little over an hour for our meals and service was slow! Dinners were mediocre as the burgers had a half a head of iceberg lettuce on top which made it difficult to eat. The turkey club was soggy, drenched in mayonnaise & fries were warm and wilted!  At the end of the meal, my friend argued with the manager for 20 mins and they finally discounted the bill by a small margin! None of us cared for the rude remarks!

On our way out we went to Margarittaville to grab a quick lunch. I had the black and blue burger, something relatively easy and fast to make. No seafood, no extras. After we left, my head started to hurt. At first I attributed it to sinuses. But the further out we drove, the more nauseated I became. Next thing I knew, everything grew blurry and I had to get my girlfriend to take the wheel. Three miles later, we had to pull over and look for the nearest hospital. After blowing my groceries in a technicolor yawn, we were able to make it back to LA. I emailed the restaurant to let them know not to sell any more burger meat lest they have other customers get sick. I got no response, nor even an apology or acknowledgement -- even after their site said someone would contact me in 24-48hours. It's now been four days. So I thought I'd at least warn others of their unacceptable demeanor.",

It's actually pretty neat on the inside. There's a section of booths that looks like the back of fishing boats. Their music is pumping for the party that's usually going on on their balcony most nights. Not terrible but it's a little distracting. Their margarita menu is large and the two we tried were well mixed. There was a lot of tequila but it didn't detract from the taste. That being said, the alcohol content did sneak up on us and we felt a little tipsy after one drink. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Next we had their chicken volcano nachos. This thing was huge and was clearly meant to serve more than two people. We picked at the plate for almost an hour and still had to take some of it back to our room. Admittedly after the drinks and appetizer we were done so we didn't have any dinner items. If you've never been I'd say give it a try. It's an expierience. However I don't think anyone would be clamoring to get back for another visit.",

The atmosphere is usually very fun, everyone is having a good time, and things are just....laid back.  I get the Volcano Nachos each and every time, so I can't speak much on the other menu items.  For $15.99 you get a plate of nachos that 2 people can very rarely finish, so it's basically a nacho buffet for under $10/person.  Can't beat that.  And they're really GOOD nachos, not your generic nachos.    Drinks can be a little pricey, but it's on the Las Vegas Strip, so that's to be expected.  You can plan on paying around $10 for any of their mixed drinks, and I think their beers will run you anywhere from $5-$8 (I don't drink beer, but that's just been what I can remember from people with us ordering them).  The main level can get a little noisy at times, but they have a 2nd and 3rd level where things are a lot quieter if you want to be able to carry on a casual conversation.  But if you're going there for a good time and you're not going to be there many times, I'd definitely recommend the ground level so you can get the full experience.  Waiters and waitresses are generally on the ball and keep your glasses full and address any needs, although there has been a time or 2 where that wasn't the case.  That's to be expected after literally probably 50 visits, though.    Highly, highly recommend.",

    "text": "I was just sort of cruising the strip trying to figure out where to eat dinner.  It was in the 30s so most of my wanderings were inside the casinos as I made my way North.  This is where I was when I decided I was hungry.  Even though it was only around 6 most of the tables were being used.  I was seated right away and the service was generally good the whole meal.  I got a Filet ($24.95).  There was nothing great or bad about the food, the meat was medium, the vegetables were fully cooked without being mushy, I don't care for skins in my mashed potatoes but I lived through it.  The basic margarita ($8) was ok, certainly not great nor very large.  This is the only one I have been in even though there is one near where I live.  I would describe the atmosphere as organized chaos.  At ground level there were 2 stages and 2 bars and I got the impression some of the seating areas did double duty as food tables or bar tables depending on the day or time.  It was sort of confusing where the host station was unless you caught a glimpse of the sign on the front wall.  You could get into the dining area through one of the bars and there were several people who wandered in and had to get ushered over to the hostess station after they tried just taking a table or trying to share a table with another party.  The music videos were fairly loud and while it made for hard conversation it fit the place.",

My onion rings (+$1) were delicious, but they were just as oily as any other place's rings would be having been yanked out of the fryer. Tried my friend's fries, and they were good too.  We split an order of coconut shrimp with the marmalade sauce - DELICIOUS!  We each had the add-a-salad too. It was a fresh, very simple salad, with seedy little cut-in-half teardrop tomatoes. I had mine with mango ranch (for authenticity's sake) and I enjoyed it.  We ordered tea to drink. They're generous with the lemon wedge, and they kept up with the refills for us just fine!  Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville is a very thematic place, as is everything in Las Vegas. It is enjoyable. It's a pleasant, fun and exciting atmosphere offering up \"just average\" to \"really good\" food.",

I knew going into it I wasn't going to be eating healthy so I wasn't surprised. I had the perfect margarita to go along with the appetizers and it was okay.

Quesadillas were ok, the scampi pasta had mediocre flavor,  the nachos were huge but lacked in flavor.  HOWEVER, the shrimp and grits got rave reviews! Not much menu variety other than sandwiches, pasta and overpriced basic dishes! It took FOREVER for our food to come and one of the orders was wrong. They did comp the incorrect order which was nice! Overall...no need to stop... unless you are craving shrimp and grits!",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Jimmy Buffett, so when a few friends suggested we grab some food at Margaritaville, my mouth started to water for a salty rim, full of tequila. However, I was disappointed with this location [I've been to the one in Orlando], for the following reasons.  1. It was packed. Being in the serve industry, I know things get busy and I tend to get annoyed with patrons that bitch and moan about a wait. I wasn't one of those people, but some in my party were. I explained to them the sitch, so they calmed down. After all, we did have a 12 pack to drink, while we waited.  2. We were seated shorter than our wait time, and brought back towards the bar. It took our server a good 12 minutes to greet us, and by that time we had figured out our orders, as we were just going to split a handful of apps to save a few bucks. 3. The food was meh. I wasn't impressed with the nachos, but did find the wings to be pretty good. 4. Prices were much higher than i've ever seen them...this is vegas of course.  Overall, it wasn't anything special and didn't ooze the typical JB charm. Oh well, we can't win them all.",

Look, I don't like Jimmy Buffet's music.  So when the crowd of foreigners and expats I was with kept wanting to return here I fought it.  I don't like tequila and I don't care about forty year old pirates, or whatever.  But one hot morning (stupid deserts) I was too worn out to resist and I didn't have any better ideas.  Fine, we'll go, sigh, there.  This was the least crappy spot I visited in Vegas.  The service was better than just about anywhere else and the drinks were WORTH the $13+ (plus tax, stupid sales tax) everybody charged for nothing more than a decent Jack & coke.  The \"5 O'Clock Somewhere\" had 151 ladies and gentleman that you can not taste. This should be called The Bad Idea, or Reservations at the Drunk Tank.  I had three.  The three of us moved to a table when we got word others were joining us and it took them a while go get there.  The waiter clearly didn't like us taking up space so when the girls (plus one guy) arrived I ordered some fried cheese curds to just put some money on the tab.  THEY WERE FREAKING AMAZING!  I ate something else, but I was pretty drunk, so I don't remember.  It didn't suck.  So, nope, still can't type the name, if I somehow get dragged back to your awful city, I'll return.  Especially if I can sit in those two spaces where I couldn't hear the music.",

ONE of the reasons I love the place is obviously their relentlessness commitment to Jimmy freakin' Buffet. Everything screams Jimmy Buffet. But that is all obvious, the MAIN reason I come back to this restaurant is because they have one of my favorite places in Vegas.... In the main bar up front there is a fairly small balcony/outdoor area. Its about 3-4 feet above the strip's sidewalk, with a railing to lean on. In my opinion, the best place in Vegas to people watch. Just low enough to see the faces, just high enough so that people wont hit their heads on your beers.   Some of the best times of my Vegas life have been talking with my friends on that balcony and yelling at pretty girls as they walk by.   **small tip. Get a Loaded Corona not a Loaded Landshark. Corona bottles have longer necks, fits more tequila.",

If I'm perfectly honest the server who brought us our food was 10 times better then Pamela. She was not a good waitress. Please tell your staff about providing a fun and good time atmosphere while at Margaritaville.",

It's a chain and you can tell, it's a little chaotic running around inside, lots going on and not really reminiscent of a relaxing beach affair per Mr. Buffett himself.  It could probably use a bigger bar area or maybe just a revamping of the space so it doesn't seem that you're eating in a domed cathedral but I feel I like I'm just grasping at straws here.    But yes, the Volcano Nachos are as good and large as advertised and drinks are on point, and if those are your expectations then you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Let's just get this out of the way right now, the nachos rock & that's pretty much the main reason I continue to go back. I like to get an order of them once per Vegas trip.  I came here with a group of almost 15 people. I CALLED the day before to see if I could make some kind of reservation & was told that I needed to talk to group sales, but they weren't going to be back until the next day, so I could leave a message. I left my message basically just saying we were expecting a group of 15-25 people at 6pm the next night, could we reserve a table, or if there wasn't  a table large enough, at least a section of tables near eachother? I got a call back the next day (day that we were planning on GOING) at about 10AM saying, \"No, you can reserve anything, just walk in whenever you get here\" Okay, but I can't even hold a section of tables for such a large group? Apparently not.  We get there before 6 and explain the situation. They tell me the best they can do is a table for 10 in 30 mins, or some tables of 5 that aren't near each other. Neither worked. We decided to try the back bar which was totally EMPTY and had about 20 stools, so we took it over.   We started ordering the giant margaritas with the spouts, volcano nachos, etc. People started showing up late and ordering various other things. A couple hours later the main guy that had been supplying us told me that he was getting off, so could we cash out now...even though we weren't done. I told him I guessed we could, but was rather irritated at this. They also added on gratutity, which was weird since he wa just a bartender, but whatever, it's fine. He didn't bother to ever ask or bring up the bill situation. It was clear there were a ton of people, but he just kept adding things onto MY bill, so at the end I had a $400 bill to try and break up between 20 different people. Great. I guess we must have eventually figured it out because they didn't chase us down the strip screaming STEALERS!!  End points: not great customer service for large groups, the huge margaritas were really bad this time....not enough tequila and the mix was SO strong it burned my throat, nachos are delicious (and always will be), I still will always go here b/c it's such a fun/cool place and the nachos are amazing, but would not attempt to gather a large group here again. The end.",

Margaritaville offers the service & manners lacking in so many other restaurants around here, & we love the accepting, friendly vibe.

I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere and the floor show they have with the volcano and the girl sliding down into the big margarita pitcher. Here is a list of my total experience there: 1. Called ahead and got priority seating which worked out good- highly recommend I did ask about the balcony outside but it was closed that night. No problem I thought they will enjoy the floor show  2. Ordered Chicken Caesar Salad- Not very big- soggy crouton and some soggy lettuce chicken was good but not very much.  3. Waited all through dinner to see the floor show(see above).after dinner the lights dimmed the margarita pitcher started to change color and bubble. The volcano started to steam- oh the anticipation!!! Then it stopped- that was it!!!! Asked our waiter who said that the water was bad! What? Very disappointing after talking it up to the relatives!!!   I don't know when we will be back but I won't order that salad and I will call and ask about the show!",

If your crew is into margaritas, there is this jumbo concoction that you can order.  It's a huge tube filled with margarita dispensed through a tap.  It sits at your table for you to use at your convenience.  They say it serves up to eight, but a group of 4 at our table made short work of the contents within an hour :)  A word to the wise, try and get them to change the tequila they use to a top shelf brand; their homemade concoction is icky (and has made some of the folks at my table sick in the past).  One other note, there is an lovely outdoor patio upstairs (on the 3rd floor?) with plenty of shade.  The line for seating up there was MUCH shorter than the line downstairs.  We were told that our party of 12 would be seated in 2 hrs. downstairs, so we left our name, but then went upstairs to try our luck.  We were seated in 35 minutes, yay!",

First off is the beer scam they run here where the draft price listed on the menu as five bucks. Except that's for the twelve ounce beer, also not a listed fact. Then when you order the waiter says \"would you like the twelve or the twenty-two ounce souvenir size?\" I was shrewd enough to pick up on this but they caught my friends by suprise. Anyway when you say yes to this they throw in the take home glass at which point you have to pay for the glass for ten bucks and then carry around this monument to your stupidity the rest of the night.   Food is average atmosphere is ok service sucked but was quick. I was smart I got a shot of tequila but the rest of my friends got caught in the beer scam.   So one star for blatant dishonesty and the beer bait and switch and general crappiness. One good thing we ate here the first thing we did on the first night of our trip and things went waay up from here. Vegas baby!",

One of the best (and most unique) margaritas I've ever had.  3) The cover band, playing all sorts of songs we could sing along to obnoxiously. Most notably, \"Livin' on a Prayer.\" And, of course, Jimmy Buffett tunes.  4) The totally insane patrons dancing along to said cover band. There were these 2 girls in particular, I was so proud of them. Dancing out there on the empty dance floor all alone, waving their arms and flouncing about. Eventually they got a bunch of people out there with them. Not Jess and I though, we were content to watch and be entertained.  5) The cheeseburgers -- Jimmy Buffett would be proud.  6) The patrons passed out in deck chairs out in the hallway.  Seriously, this is my new favorite bar. Ever. And there's a gift shop where you can get all your Jimmy Buffett gear! Score!",

Even their quesadillas aren't too yummy and how much easier can a meal be to make...tortilla, cheese chicken? The service is excellent and friendly tho.

Firstly I wouldn't be so foolish as to risk taking my passport out of the hotel, but this guy was the only person our whole trip who said anything about the ID I had produced.   No need for his attitude either when I mentioned I had just been served.",

The Volcano nachos are delicious, it will easily feed 4 people alone. the restaurant was packed however our service wasn't good. screwed up our order twice and took forever to even serve us. The little show they put on was lame but the guy that made our birthday balloons was hilarious. Overall its an ok place but don't think I will be going back.",

I was feeling fruity and got a strawberry daquiri here once.  It was way too strong and really wasn't the iced adult beverage you expect.  Instead it came out of some slurpee type dispenser.  Please put a little effort in if I'm paying 10 bucks!  Is a blender too much to ask?  Margaritaville is a good rendezvous point to start the night because it's easy to find/get to.  Don't stay too long unless you like being butts to nutts with tourists.  Maybe it's slightly better during the week?",

The wild berry colada was really good (I got pretty lucky with my drinks of choice on this Vegas trip). Someone else got \"the perfect margarita\", which was literally all hard liquor. Oops. Good thing he ate a whole carb-heavy pizza by himself for lunch.  The 2nd time we came here, we ordered 2 Volcano Nachos - it was way too much even as entrees. It wasn't as appetizing towards the end, or even the middle. Fajitas were meh. I didn't expect much in terms of food.   They loop clips on a projected screen of people getting sloshed somewhere on vacation. Who actually wears hawaiian shirts and leis at Margaritaville?",

Its always the same exact bartender regardless of what time I go to that bar, I swear she lives there!   For the first time ever, I was seated at a table upstairs. I got the pulled pork sandwich and a few more margaritas.   As always, I will go back. I wish I remembered the name of the waitress so I could give her a shout out, but I cant.

There were even an airplane and water-slide, though it's not open to patrons, which is just a tease. There is a show that they put on where a girl dressed as a mermaid dances around and slides down the water-slide and into a vat of \"margarita,\" which I'm sure is just water. FYI ... the tub of water that she slides into isn't very flattering for the girl. The distortion that the water created made me feel better about my own body lol.  The margaritas are good, as is to be expected. I had a regular margarita with a premium tequila since it was on special that night (it was a Wednesday). Very tasty. We didn't order entrees, but we did get a gigantic plate of nachos. And when I say gigantic, I mean GIGANTIC. One order of nachos could feed a small army, so keep that in mind. The nachos had chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and green onions. Very tasty!   Margaritaville is a fun place to stop in for a bite to eat and a margarita!",

You want an appetizer and drinks only? You have to argue to get a seat.   This, of course, annoyed the waiter in whose section we were seated. Question: \"Can we get the guacamole without cilantro (I hate cilantro!)?\" He stares at us for a couple of seconds for effect, and says, flatly, \"no.\" No \"oh, sorry, no,\" or \"no, it's made in big batches,\" but \"no (subscript: why the hell are you asking?)\" Regardless, the waiter made it really clear that an estimated $33 tab wasn't worth his trouble.   Anyway, we got the queso and two margaritas. The margaritas were honestly pretty good. But we ate a cup of queso and a basket of tortilla chips, and both the BF and I felt pretty darned sick for awhile after. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the flight to Vegas? But doubtful. Neither of us are strangers to the occasional (OK, more than occasional) indulgence in fried food.   The bad service continued, with the waiter alternating between inattention and b*tchiness. But the margaritas were good, so I'll give it two stars. Just come, order your margaritas to go, and save yourself the hassle.",

On our first night in Vegas we didn't have big plans, especially since some of our group was coming from work, so we decided to have a chill, yet drunken, night out. Margaritaville was the perfect spot for this and catered to everyone in our group.   Margaritaville is a huge, spacious, restaurant and bar. There is a huge dance floor and a stage for the band - who were playing some typical bar music - lots of Journey and 80's music. We found a table and ordered a round of kamikazi's and a couple daquiris, which altogether cost about $80 - still pretty expensive even though it's a casual bar, but hey it's Vegas.   This is a fun place to start the night out but by no means is it the destination. I love bars just as much as the next person, but there wasn't anything about this place that wow'd me enough to come back. Did the job, though!",

As far as the food goes,  I'd recommend the nachos and the \"cheeseburger in paradise.\" Food that I wouldn't quite recommend: Ahi tuna, crab/lobster dip (it was mostly cheese).   As expected, the margaritas are fantastic- just take a peak at the first page inside the menu and you can see all their signature creations. Mmmmm.",

Even when I'm with a large group, our food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.  My only minor complaint is that the entertainers who walk around on stilts are a little ... too friendly. My daughter was sitting at a table with her friends, and one of the males on stilts was very obviously flirting with her and making comments about her appearance. I understand their job is to entertain, but sometimes people just want to be left alone to enjoy their meal.

I then requested to speak to the manager- this is the kind of thing that will shut a place down!

He then proceeded to wash the glasses over again and place then properly without stacking. Glad they took note of an observation but why do the bar staff not know proper procedure? Yuck!

After we were seated, our server came over and asked if we wanted to hear the drink specials. After he described the sangria (we are not wine drinkers, so we don't usually order sangria) we ordered a pitcher of it, and it was awesome. Our server was great, and very personable. They have people walking around on stilts making conversation and entertaining people. I thought that was a little odd, but they seemed nice. There was a little show during the dinner where they make the volcano \"erupt\", and the girl slides into the giant blender. It was fun and cute.   I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, and it was great. Great flavor, but a little on the messy side. My partner in crime ordered the diablo burger. To both of us, it seemed a little bland and definitely not spicy.   Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience.",

Margaritas are ok, I got the big Rita I think, and it came with a nice cup to take home. Nice and loud.. rowdy ambiance. I liked it a lot.   Plus they had pirates, lifeguards, and seamen (oh yeah) walking around on stilts making balloons. We got a shark and flower hat.. pretty weak.. should have gotten the animal or viking hat.  Oh and a tip... the bar is first come first serve seating.. so go and camp out some tables and don't wait in line like the other chumps.",

One of my friends had the avocado turkey burger, which she said was pretty good. My other friend had the chicken quesadilla. They gave her so much that she gave one slice to me, because my salad didn't fill me up. That's what I get for trying to be on a diet in Vegas.  We tried to order margaritas with the bottle of Corona beer in it, but they said they couldn't serve that much alcohol to one person. Something about a law... We could order the drinks separately, but where's the fun in that? I ended up having ginger ale. They had Coronas.   Go hungry. Leave happy. The price is right.",

The staff made no mention of the fact that our table (including food and beverages) would be showered with stripper pool water when a bikini clad dirty woman slid down a water slide from above the dining room into a giant blender that resembled a carnival dunk tank. She then surfaced and flung more water onto us and our food. Completely disgusting. They could have told us that our table would be part of the water show or at least not served our food until after the splashing was finished. Who wants their dinner served with pool water? Waiter came by after the 'show' to check on us. I told him it was really not okay that our dinner was now a la swimming pool and he did NOTHING. We didn't ask for a manager, but one came by and asked if we had. We said no, but told him that his staff should give people a heads up before seating folks in that area. He said they should have told us and offered to discount our check. He took $4 off! What a crock of chit! Despite being musically themed, the acoustics are horrible. The music ranges from annoyingly loud to mega loud and distorted. This place sucks in every way possible.",

But as a California girl who grew up on Mexican food I can't bring myself to giving this place 3 stars.   PROS: We were seated fast. Our waiter was knowledgeable, fast and patient. They had a LOT of different flavors of margaritas. This place is good if you have kids or parents who just want basic food and aren't into the nicer, more unique restaurants on the strip. This place is in the middle of the strip. It's reasonably priced.  CONS: The food is on the same level as Chevy's. Americanized Mexican food. We ordered the nachos. They use American ingredients to make Mexican food. Not a lot of flavor or spice. I was hoping it would be a little bit more authentic than Chevy's or On The Border but it's not.",

One of guys suggested margaritaville. I mean part of the reason why we went was because one of the guys in our group loves to dance with cougars to make them feel better about themselves. Personally i didn't think that there were that many there, but the margaritas were both good and strong. Not only that i got a guy to buy me a drink.  Go me!  Then again if the place is called Margaritaville, i do expect good margaritas.   Weird music, not really danceable but we had a good time regardless.",

Not sure if you have to ask to sit in the \"fun\" section of the restaurant but we were greatly disappointed when we were sat by the window in a completely empty section away from the entertainment when there was room to be had in the mostly empty restaurant on a Monday evening. I came to Margaritaville because they had an extensive gluten free menu so I was at least happy to have food options that were relatively safe. I went with the taco salad after feeling the need to eat light. It ended up being a pretty heavy salad which is okay with the typical steep-Las Vegas-Strip prices. My dining companion ordered the Mahi Mahi which he thought was just okay. We ordered two margaritas (the spicy one whose name doesn't come to mind and the mango). Both were also just okay as they seemed watered down with artificial ingredients. The entertainment was fun from what we could see all the way across the room.",

This has always been one of my favorite places to wile away an afternoon in Vegas, sipping on Bama Breezes and chatting with fellow imbibers.  Given my lifelong obsession with Jimmy Buffet, Margaritaville is my home away from home. The drinks are DELICIOUS (although I wish they had larger sizes for some of the yummy specialty frozen drinks -- and a little more liquor in them), and the food is good (not fabulous, but good).   I made several stops here on this particular trip - for drinkies and food, and it didn't disappointed. You also get little shows here, so there's a lot of entertainment value.  I love you Margaritaville - lord knows I'm helping to line Mr. Buffett's pockets with my frequent patronage. :)",

I had 3.  keep in mind we were here for hours and we were grazing on Ahi tuna and coconut shrimp. I can't really review them though because I don't remember them. I just saw them on my bill. I didn't even know I ate Ahi tuna.  OH GOD. I had 7 margaritas? guess how I spent my Saturday?",

I was pretty surprised to be honest, as they just make huge batches of the stuff and pump it out en masse.   The food wasn't anything spectacular, but you most certainly could do worse on the strip for your money.  You are really paying for the atmosphere here.  Everything is tacky and very Vegas, but that's why you are there in the first place.  Definitely would go again, just nothing incredible or mind-blowing in my book.",

There were four large pretzels and after a few bites dipped in the brown mustard, they got old quickly.  There was also a small cup of cheese sauce...maybe more of that would have been better.  We didn't finish the pretzels.  The crab dip and crackers was a small portion for $13.95.  $9.95 would have been a fair price.  The service was fine.  Perhaps the drinks are better but after having numerous free drinks in the casinos it seemed silly to spend more money on drinks.",

Now this trip my waiter told one of my family members \"you need to fucking chill\" because the waiter didn't give the change back. I understand that it was a few cents, but you don't assume a customer doesn't want their change back. When I told the waiter that if she continues to talk to my family like that we won't come back in which she replied \"we don't want you here\", I spent over 300 dollars on this meal specifically. Let alone the other times where I spend 250 or more for our dinner and drinks. This bitch of a server will be the reason why you won't be getting my money ever again, after all the times I've been there and the money I've spent that's rediculous. I can't comprehend why she would treat us like this, it's not my fault she's not happy there. Now you just lost my business and my family's business.",

The interesting thing is that they have these people who walk on those wooden thingys that make them really tall and they make balloon animals and stuff. We stayed long enough to see the volcano erupt with margarita and there's this girl that slides down into a cup filled with margarita. She does a little dance. The volcano nachos were really good! we asked for more guacamole and it was free. We also had the coconut fried shrimp with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was okay. The shrimp was fried too crispy and hard. The veggies were too soft. The mashed potatoes was the only good thing. I didn't get to try the drinks here though. The atmosphere here is a bit too noisy for me and my bf.",

It was delicious. $14.99 crab, shrimp, hollandaise sauce. NOM. Husband ordered the eggs benedict. He always loves it, as long as the hollandaise sauce is right and the eggs aren't overcooked you can't go wrong. Would eat here again :) Forgot that they gave us a 20% off our next visit coupon.

I thought that overall--the food was a great value for the price--for Vegas anyway and the drinks were yummy!    I would suggest that they add a Mojito to the drink menu tho....come-on now!!...get some damn mint!!  The 3rd floor is great for people watching, the guy on stilts is cool and I really liked the whole decor of the place.    Service on the whole was very good!  Gift shop is, of course, extremely overpriced but whatcha gonna do....  There were some anirondack chairs in the hallway into the giftshop that seemed to have a mysterious effect on anyone who sat down in them--whenever we walked past the chairs there was at least one person totally zonked out sleeping with mouth open---musta had one too many perfect margaritas.....",

Margaritaville is the shizniz.  The only lame part is having to down your drink before entering (and with 32oz American beer just bought on the street 10 min beforehand, this is no easy feat).  But alas, a few gulps later, we walked into a lively atmosphere with sticky floors and fantastic music.  Almost like a nightclub, but free and with much less douchebaggery, Margaritaville is a fantastic place to spend an hour or so, before hitting up the next spot on the strip.  The margaritas are super tasty, and expensive to boot.  But it's Vegas, so if you don't expect it it's your own damn fault.  Go for the margaritas.  Go for the music.  Go for JIMMY.",

    "text": "Boy, I REALLY wanted to like this place... But what a shitty experience!   We were seated quickly, which was expected because it was a late Sunday night and there was only 3 of us. I know it's Vegas, but it wasn't poppin' or anything. We were seated by the window, which normally would be fine, but the AC was on full blast directly at us. It was nice for about 2 minutes, then we were all freezing.  We waited 10 minutes before seeing our waiter, which shouldn't have happened seeing as they were slow (and not understaffed). We ordered waters and said we'd need just another minute with the menus. About 5 minutes later, our waiter brought the waters. At this time, we asked to move to a table not under the AC. He pointed to a table and said once it was clean, we could move over there, and he walked away. A few minutes later, we moved ourselves over.   It took 15 minutes before our new waiter stopped by. Again, not okay. We ordered dinner and an appetizer. The appetizer came promptly, and we were told the food would take about 30 minutes because I had ordered a steak (cooked well), which is understandable.  Finally we got our food, over 45 MINUTES later. I went to take my first bite of mashed potatoes and just about lost my appetite.... I FOUND A HAIR. Gross.   At this point, my mom was pissed. She asked to see the manager. He came over and was very kind (wish I would have gotten his name). He apologized multiple times and said he'd have the kitchen rush me a new one (after making sure that's what I'd like to happen). 20 minutes later, I got a new steak and sides. (Funny how it came twice as fast that time....)   I was super disappointed, though. The steak was not good. I know Margaritaville isn't a steakhouse, but for $26.99 you'd think they could cook a decent New York Strip.   The ONLY redeeming factor at this place was the manager. He even took my dish off of the bill.   Definitely don't recommend going and won't be back! Bummer!",

    "text": "Finally getting around to writing the review, ate here awhile ago.  Experience was great.  Ahh, that smell inside, reminds you of a beach.  Hostess was great, asked if we could sit on rooftop for a great view of the strip -no issues.  They have water misting outside leaving you cool during the summer evening.    We ate on a Sunday, so no wait to eat, also, we may have gone before peak hours.  I ordered landshark (jimmy Buff beer) and my lady ordered the blender margarita, was expensive, but worth it (according to her).  Both of us got the signature burgers, plenty of food to go around.  Would definitely eat here again, would recommend the outdoor section that overlooks the strip.  I cannot speak for what experience you may have eating inside, but outside was extremely nice.  Waitress was great",

I love to have Margaritas before noon, truly the breakfast of champions.   I have to start with staff and the great service they provide, keep up the great job crew. They seem to be happy working here and it shows. My kids love the people on stilts making balloons for everyone young and old. Funny hats, animals, swords, and \"special\" balloons for bachelorette parties. Cover the kids eyes.  My wife and I think the food is okay. We usually order some cheese burgers or chicken fingers for the kids, my wife likes the coconut shrimp, and I will try some fish tacos. What we really enjoy are the nachos, they are the bomb!  Be warned, the nachos are a meal of their own.   What gives this joint the 4 stars is the vacation atmosphere and the Margaritas. Must tries are the Perfect Margarita, the Pink Cadillac, the Pomegranate, and the Who's to Blame Margarita. I guarantee, after you try all of them you will be in paradise.",

My husband and I stopped in on 9/1 and shared the combo fajitas.  They weren't sizzling when they came to the table, but the flavor was alright.  They seemed to me like they had been sitting in a warmer tray or something, but what do you expect when the place is packed?  They can't cook each one to order or it would take forever.  We also had a side of 3 coconut shrimp which were a greasy little treat.  I don't eat much fried food, but I did enjoy my 1 1/2 shrimp.    The drinks were great as always and Jimmy on the big screen was great escapism from the crowded chaos of The Strip.  I was impressed with the hostesses up front who have to manage the flow of traffic coming in that joint.  People don't pay any attention and just walk on up to the dining room when they need to check in with the hostess first, and there was always someone there to guide them in the right direction whether it was back to the hostess or on to one of the 4 bars.  Our server was very friendly and on time with refills & the check.  I'd definitely go back.",

We all ordered something different as usual so we could taste different things. A fish sandwich w/fries, a salad she wasnt feelin well only came with lettuce tomato and cucumber, 1pork taco &1 beef taco  beans that we had to pay extra for, what tacos no beans and rice included ludacris, and a steak that came with fries what no choice of fries mashed or baked and no veggies, 1 soda 2 margaritas $105.00. This had to be the most disappointing meal i have ever had, mainly because we had wanted to dine here for so long. I could have bought a better looking salad from the grocery store, my daughter only ate 2 bites of her fish sandwich it was made with grouper and disgusting, my other daughter said her tacos were ok beans too salty, now for my steak cooked exactly as ordered but soooo much salt it was ridiculous. The margaritas watermelon & strawberry were void of fruit flavor and alcohol. I guess we should have ordered what they are famous for the giant order of nachos which were coming out of the kitchen constantly. Give them 1 star because of the service.",

This can be said about a lot of Strip places and this and Toby Keith's at Harrah's are perfect examples. Just because you live in a tourist town doesn't mean you can't go to tourist places. For God's sake, we assume people that live in Hawaii go to the beach. So we're going to the strip and places like this and we're having as much fun as everyone else.",

I thought all of their margaritas were yummy.  However they come in a 12oz glass.  I can chug that before you can even blink!  They're good but small unless you get the souvenir mug.  The inside is all dim and campy with appropriate decor for what Margaritaville should be.  The waitress I had was awesome, so friendly and took care of us even when her family was there at the next table.  The staff was also incredibly friendly to Pat Baby's niece.  During the show where the girl comes out of the volcano and guys on stilts sing and interact with the audience,  they really engaged his niece and she had lots of fun.  I was also very entertained, it was just a positive and happy vibe all around.  As for the food, well I'd say the quality is like any Joe's Crab Shack or Chili's.  Don't expect anything healthy here of course, but when in Vegas, might as well be a little gluttonous.",

The food is average and the prices are a little high...and unless you LOVE Jimmy Buffett, the ambiance is also average.   We went here for lunch on a Monday after our family party of 9 didn't like the menu of a nearby restaurant. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away (unlike the other venue).  We ordered the nachos for the table (chili on the side). They were pretty good (not WOW like other people on here are saying) and hit the spot while we waited for our food. I had the taco salad which was so-so and my sis-in-law had the lava lava shrimp which she said was undercooked.  My parents split the Caesar salad...I didn't hear them raving about it but I also didn't hear them complain. I'm pretty sure their mac and cheese kids option was just a box of Kraft served in a dish. The kids quesadilla came with a lot of chicken and on a huge platter. Actually all the portions were huge so come hungry or ask for to go boxes.    Won't race back esp since there are a ton of other restaurants in the Linq Pavillion but it wasn't a terrible experience.",

My friend and I order the sirloin steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare and when it came out one was burnt and all fat and the other burnt outside and very raw in the inside. The salad which was included with meal was very bland and had no taste, the only good thing was the mashed potatoes and the green beans.

You can call ahead and put your name on a list for \"priority seating\" not sure if that actually makes a difference - we were seated pretty quickly.  They have two tacos for $9.99 - I preferred the pork to the steak.  They were pretty filling - I didn't want to eat anything too big and risk a club-preventing food coma so this was just right!

We (party of 4) had to check in with the front counter then see a hostess then got our table. We received our Menus. It was not busy what so ever and we seen everyone else get service as we looked at the menu. Not once did we receive any contact from anyone. I observed the same waitress walk by us 6 times! So after waiting a total of 20 minutes from when we walked to our table and not receive a second of service, we walked out. No one attempted to contact us and as we walked out, we observed 4 young female employees all huddled like they were on break and laughing while they stared at the same phone. Now let's talk about the menu, very limited and over priced food we can find at smiths. We ended up going to the yard house and not only was seated right away but had our drinks with in 5 minutes. (Not drink order but we're actually drinking). We tipped her $30 because of how awesome she was. So is this how you promote your locals knowing we went out of our way to go to the strip and paid for parking?

It's very lively and there's usually various forms of entertainment of some sort (people on stilts making balloon animals/headgear etc. and a mermaid that slides down into a huge pitcher and does her own many cirque performance).   The menu is pretty massive and the food is good - I wouldn't say mind blowing but I find any place that has a menu this large, you are just going to get good/okay food but I've never been unsatisifed.  The best part is really the drinks! Soooo many to choose from! I usually get the margarita, well, since this is Margartiaville, and they have yet to disappoint!   This is just a fun place to hang out and have some drinks. I definitely would go again here or at any of their other locations.",

Overpriced for the quality/quantity (but it is Vegas).  My friend's chicken was undercooked, so she sent it back and the waitress brought out a new sandwich and took it off the bill, which I thought was pretty nice.  Will definitely be back this summer for drinks, not for food.",

Ive ordered them at least a dozen times but that night neither flavor was very good. The band playing was so-so and we have for sure seen much better there. We found ourselves praying for the music to stop so we could have a conversation. This was the only time we didn't enjoy our time there and Im sure the food was the main issue.

    "text": "Mecca for Parrot Heads  \"If life gives you limes, make margaritas\", said Jimmy Buffett, founder of the tropical themed oasis Margaritaville. Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is a mecca for Parrot Heads or anyone else who wants to have a good time and a great meal in a premier tropical environment. At Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville there are various reasons that attract customers from all over the state, all over the country, and even other countries. Some specific titles that are associated with Margaritaville include: an amazing and vibrant ambiance, wide variety of delectable items on the menu, and outstanding service.  Margaritaville is definitely a top the charts when it comes to their ambiance being original, even though their creativity is through the roof. Guaranteed you will not find any other restaurant that can compare when it comes to having the \"ultimate\" tropical setting.  For example, before you even walk into Margaritaville, outside of the joint is giant tropical neon sign saying \"Margaritaville\" with a giant led screen below it. Then as you walk inside the restaurant you immediately notice the bow of a ship with a mermaid on the front end, and as you take a few more steps in, you see this giant decorative water plane hanging in the middle of the place.  With all the decorations they have to recreate a tropical setting, they also have relaxing good time music to compliment the decor of the restaurant. Most of the music being played is of course a lot of Jimmy Buffet, but also a fair amount of anything in the reggae/ tropical Caribbean type genre.   If you're not already persuaded to come to Margaritaville for its one of the kind ambiance, then maybe the items of their menu will make you think otherwise. From firsthand experience, I can say that Margaritaville has some the best food and drink combinations that I have come across on any menu. A good example of some of their food that got me hooked right away was one of their appetizers called Volcano Nachos. Now these are no regular nachos like you see at most restaurants. The Volcano Nachos are stacked probably about six to seven inches high topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and scallions all on a regular sized dinner. It says it's an appetizer, but in all honesty it is more of an entree and could take more than one person to finish them. As you get to the entrees of the menu you will be confronted with the task of choosing which delectable meal you would like. An entree that I know will catch most people's attention would have to be their Al Vacado Burger (topped with guacamole, jalapeno, mayonnaise, cheddar and Monterey jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and an onion ring on a toasted bun) or even their signature Barbeque Pork Sandwich (pulled pork with guava barbeque sauce and topped with onion rings and served open faced on thick garlic French bread). To help wash down your food while you enjoy your meal you can choose from a wide variety of different drink combinations that suites your taste. If you're into frozen drinks, you should definitely try the Bama Breeze (made with Cruzan Vanilla Rum, Margaritaville Authentic Island Silver Rum, Island Oasis Pina Colada and mango mixes and orange juice) for it will surely satisfy your taste buds. If that doesn't do the trick try a non frozen drink with a tropical kick such as the Gravity Storm (made with Margaritaville Authentic Island Coconut Rum, Chambord Black Raspberry Liqueur, fresh lemonade, cranberry juice, and a splash of soda water).  To top of your meal you got to end with a sensuous treat. You can choose anything from brownies to milkshakes. If your more of someone who likes edible treats they can pick apart with spoon you should choose either the key lime pie, which is a True taste of the tropics, or the Chocolate Hurricane (warm dark chocolate brownie layered with Dreyer's vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and chopped macadamia nuts) for all you chocolate fanatics out there.",

This place can get pretty crowded but we actually sat at the bar to have a few margaritas and try their wings.  It was so good that we ordered another plate of it, yummmm!! The sauce was just right: spicy enough and the right amount of sourness (if you get what I mean).  Of course the margaritas weren't bad either.  Pretty tasty in fact.  We had a few that definitely gave us a good buzz!  Sitting at the bar you've got front row seats for their little show of a girl sliding down their indoor volcano (on a water slide)--or something like, that.  I can't really remember.  Haha, maybe the margaritas were better than I thought!",

    "text": "Been here a handful of times since it opened. It has always been good, but the new has definitely worn off. At first, it was fun checking out all the decorations, the boat booths, the volcano, etc. While I still think the food is good, I'd like to see them change up the menu or add to it. I'm sure they've made some changes, but it's hardly noticeable. I had a pulled pork sandwich this time which I've had before. They now serve it open faced and put two onion rings on it. The onion rings were great, but it's still the same sandwich. This seems to be the way they've changed things up. I'm not positive, but I think I remember the drinks coming in actual glasses instead of the plastic cups they were served in on this visit. I can understand that sometimes drunks shouldn't be given glass, but at this particular time, I didn't see any reason to think that the crowd would get out of hand, and I hate drinking out of plastic cups. It's not a keg party. I'm sure they can do plenty of business with only first time customers, but I'm running out of reasons to come back when there are new restaurants opening in Vegas every week. The food doesn't stand out enough to keep people returning, it's the theme. I guess it's still better than many of the other casual dining tourist traps on the strip. I AM a Jimmy Buffett fan, and Margaritaville is a great brand. I have been to and enjoyed their restaurants in many cities. I just hope it doesn't get too stale like a Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood restaurant. Obviously in Vegas, it's much more difficult to keep up with all the competition.",

    "text": "Friends came into town and after a day of casino wanderin we were in need of some grub before a late night dinner reservation. We wanted nachos. Man oh man did we find a great place for them in Margaritaville. Getting there the place looked packed but we somehow managed to wrangle a table and not long after sitting down someone came along to take our order. A group of 5 we ordered margaritas and the guy offered us a \"tower\" which is like 12 margaritas in one giant tower for the same price as 5 single margaritas - so we did it. Got the plate o nachos as well. Everything came out within 10 minutes.  Everything tastes like the regular pre-packed mixes and cans. The margaritas we nothing to rave about and the nachos were pretty standard fare with no real heart to the salsa or cheese, but once we got into our 2nd and 3rd glasses of margaritas it was party time and everything started tasting GREAT!  Now came the best part of all. We were sitting close to the top bar and right next to a giant glass of swirling green liquid with a ladder next to it. You want this table. Our waiter suggested we should move the table back and enjoy the show. The jimmy buffet song begins to play, a very sexy scantly clad girl comes out holding margarita pitchers, ascends the ladder climbs to the top of a mountain and disappears, only to emerge in a bikini and go down a slide into the glass where she performs a show that can only be described as legendary. She even takes pictures with you.  And all in all we really didn't spend that much. Between the tower and the nachos we were only at like $60 for 5 people and we were pretty well satisfied. Add a show onto that and I sure walked out of there happy. One of the best values on the strip I have come across.",

It was smoky and loud and I'm pretty sure our waiter could barely hear us, so I'll forgive the orders that he messed up (including forgetting to bring drinks out to the table). However, that does not excuse the very slow service and the fact that when our food finally did arrive, it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes or so. My burger was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork.",

    "text": "This was our first time to Margaritaville. Will be our last. We just wanted dinner, no cocktails.  We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, which it was. Our first table was upstairs where the sun was beating down, so we asked for another table. There were many empty tables in our section, so we chose another. (Btw, why the wait when there are so many empty tables? Short of staff? How long have you guys been in business?) The problem with all the tables in that section is that the loud electronica music from outside (no windows) bleeds in and competes with the Margaritaville music. This goes on through your whole meal.  My husband ordered the fish tacos. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. Took a while for the food to come. Our meals were barely warm. His black beans even had that dry film on them. They must have been sitting in that ramekin for some time.  My grilled chicken sandwich did not seem to come right off the grill. Felt like it was cooked hours ago and kept warm. The taste and texture were ok, but it was dry. Bun was dry. Fries were barely warm.  Our meals probably sat on the counter for some time before they brought them out to us.  Did we complain? No. We should have. But when you're hungry you'll eat most anything. And by the time the waiter came back, then to wait for new meals, it would have taken too long.  Our take is that the booze and (cheesey) entertainment come first here. If you just want a decent meal, forget it. No way in hell would Jimmy Buffet dine here.",

To be honest I didn't expect much from the place at first, most casual bars have mediocre food and service, but I was definitely wrong. Our server Sean was great, he made outstanding recommendations on drinks as well as the food. He was just a courteous and genuine person, and I would return here on my next trip to Vegas based on his service alone. Totally recommend the Perfect Margarita and Nachos!",

Fun atmosphere of course, although I'm not much of a Jimmy Buffet fan, but lively decor and feel. My server was Alisha and she had a pleasant demeanor and made me feel welcomed. One thing I've got to say that really set this place apart; I'm a local, and it was refreshing to see a staff that is not a bunch of models. When going out in Vegas, it gets a little weary when so many places want good looking model-types that are attractive, but don't always seem to have a knack for the business. The whole 'wear a bathing suit to the interview\" thing is a bit insulting. The staff I encountered yesterday were hard working Americans of all shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds, and it was refreshing! They were just like me! They were all running around and being busy and seemed to enjoy themselves. No one had to show lots of skin to solicit a bigger tip. This made me feel at home, and I will be back.",

We just went to the bar for a quick appetizer to hold us over until dinner.  We each ordered a margarita and an order of nachos to share.  The waitress was prompt in taking our order and she made our drinks quickly.  The drinks were great as usual.  It took 45 minutes to receive our nachos- by that time it was stupid for us to even eat them since we were going for a huge dinner in just about an hour.  REPEATING THEME ABOUT LAS VEGAS- EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE. We were disappointed by the speed of almost every restaurant we went to during our stay.  Other than that the nachos were great.  Piled high with all the works and yummy as usual.  We will be returning to Margaritaville in the future because its tradition and you know exactly what you are getting, but we will certainly leave more time if we visit again in Las Vegas.  Pick up the pace Vegas! I don't have time to waste- there is too much to do and see!",

Despite this place being at the Flamingo - I give it 5 stars. I can't understand people giving this place a poor rating because of the food. If you want fancy grub, fine go somewhere else. Hello, its called Margarittaville, what did you think? Vegas has a ton of places for you to be bored at, so go pretend you're on a food show somewhere else. With that said, I think the food here is  good & def good enuf for me and have always had good to great service  Of course ill be back, in fact im probably at the table next to you with a giant balloon contraption on my head.",

My fiance and I are both in the restaurant industry, and she checked every box on what a great server should be- friendly, attentive, fast, etc etc. She suggested a great margarita for me, and checked on us frequently throughout our meal. My favorite thing about her was that she was personal and not the general \"is everything ok here\" she knew exactly our situation and where we should be in our meal  Food was also fantastic! Everything came out fast and hot. Drinks also came out fast and were much stronger than normal casual restaurant drinks!  What a great experience at Margaritaville because of Priscilla!!!!!!",

I got this  blackened shrimp wedge salad, the waiter informed me that they were out of wedge lettuce. I thought that was kind of odd considering its a head of lettuce sliced into wedges. So he ask me if I would take chopped up lettuce instead. The salad turned out to be EXCELLENT. The paradise island salad dressing is to die for. My partner meal was good too. We definitely recommend this place to eat. Just a tip for y'all, make the time to cut up a head of lettuce. I mean, chopped lettuce was good and all but really, the wedge salad is on your menu.. This tells me that the Chef or the staff was too lazy to sliced up a head of lettuce. Really, don't mislead people.",

The tropical drinks went a little down hill since the last time but the food got better.  We ordered the 100 ounce margarita and it was sooo yummy! For 12 of us we each had about 2 glasses and it costs $65 which is cheaper than ordering individual margaritas.  Definitely get the NACHOS, those are to die for and are huge so if you're in a large group then order them.  I ordered the jerk chicken with veggies and wild rice, I finished my entire plate and I never do!  We were so full the rest of the day and everyone loved their food and the waiters are always awesome. We also didn't have to wait that long on a Saturday. Whyyy don't we get drunk and screwwww",

We wanted a Cadillac margarita, the waitress tried to tell us the Cointreau was what made the cAdillac.  We said no it's grand marnier but she insisted it was the Cointreau.  Needless to say it was not a Cadillac.  The nachos left a lot to be desired as well.  Very little meat and toppings. A huge bowl of chips with Guac and sour cream and jalepeno a on top. Disappointing visit .  The live band however made up for the negative but not enough to get beyond two stars.",

The first time was a little rough but like I said, everyone has a bad night occasionally.  I really hoped for more and just didn't get it. The last time was just a few days ago. The waiter we had was entirely clueless and seemed as if he didn't care if we were there or not. I thought maybe we arrived late and he was tired but it was only a little after 8, and this is Vegas! We ordered a couple of simple items, Chicken Quesadillas, and a salad. First, that took more than 20 minutes to arrive. The Q's were dry, the chicken actually tasted a bit gamey and I was a little afraid to take more than a few bites. A really bad flavor. The salad was OK, nothing exceptional. Why didn't I say something to our waiter? We never saw him after he dropped the food off and when he finally wandered near, I just told him to bring the check. Done with this place.",

I'm an ardent JB fan, and will support his free shows on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmargaritaville.tv&s=e4176976ac61f7b2b0938c4ae6d9cc00e978f0dcd45b78f7182db3821cc03b6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">margaritaville.tv</a> by buying Landshark and Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Makers, but I won't be back to Margaritaville Las Vegas.  Maybe some of the others locations are better and I'll still give them a try.  Just missed the Cleveland opening.  It's my understanding either a management company took over a couple of years ago or bought the restaurant.  That's when the food went to crap and I quit going to the restaurant, but when they closed the upstairs bar, that did them in.  JB must maintain some control over this terrible image, so maybe he'll force a buyback or hire another management company.    They dumped their locals discount card a couple of years ago.",

Drinks were good, but could have been stronger.  I love fruity drinks but I didn't even leave with a buzz and usually I do after one drink.  The food took forever.  I mean like 40 minutes.  Some people from our table went to another bar to drink and when they came back, our food was still not there yet.  Our waiter never came back to check on us after he took our order.  We couldn't even get his attention.  He forgot a couple drink orders completely and messed up on one of our food orders.  It took an additional 10 more minutes to get that fixed.    After our meal we had to wait awhile to find our waiter so we could pay.  When we finally did, he never came back to get the money.  Another 10 minutes go by and we had to stop him to come to our table.  Just glad gratuity wasn't already added since we had a group of 6.    Horrible service and watered down drinks.",

I can definitely see this place as being fun but touristy. Kinda like a Rainforest Cafe but less emphasis on animals and more on the tequila and Jimmy Buffett.  We came at 3pm on a Saturday. The hostess said it'll be a 25-30 minute wait, but it ended up being close to 45 minutes. There were a lot of tables open, but they were probably just understaffed.   Food was meh. We got the Volcano Nachos, which they weren't kidding when they named it \"volcano\". It was a gigantic pile of chips, but I feel like there weren't enough toppings. Only one small dollop of guac and another small dollop of sour cream. Not enough melted cheese either.   We also got the crab dip. The cheese in this was too overpowering, so I couldn't taste crab at all. I did like the crostinis though.  Sadly, none of my friends were down to split a margarita with me, so I'll probably stop by in the future for one. Seems like they have a pretty good variety. Our waitress was nice and constantly refilled our waters since we all looked like we were dying.",

Dry & unflavored, had to ask for extra sauce! I've had this several times before & I was super excited, but unfortunately very disappointed! My bf had fish n'chips, that dish seemed ok. Waitress was basically non-existent.   We tried again the very next morning to have breakfast, we both wish we would have gone somewhere else. I had eggs benedict, way over cooked, no runny yokes. My bf had steak & eggs - some much gristle throughout the meat. We both \"kinda\" had to eat our meals.... one because we were hungry & meals were pricy. Two because our waitress barely ever stopped by. Took forever to get some water, approx 10 & that's before we ever got to order!   Won't come here again!

The regular margaritas are not too sweet or sour, and the other mixed drinks appear to have just enough alcohol content in them (all depends on your bartender that day). The perfect margarita? Whoa! Strong, strong, STRONG! This is one drink that will knock you on your butt if you are careful.   For the food, what can I say? Good-sized portions for the price. The fish tacos for lunch was served at a larger quantity than expected, with side choices of black beans, etc. The jambalaya was served extra spicy, which made the meal truly exceptional to remember. And you didn't get too stuffed within the process.  Now, the evening entertainment. For those that haven't been here before, there is a 10% entertainment \"tax\" assessed on your bill during the evening hours. The reason is that there are 3 shows per evening during the weekday, and 4 shows on the weekends. It is highly recommended asking your hostess whether you can have a table either on the pirate ship or close to the pirate ship in order to really enjoy the entertainment up close. My evening entertainment consisted of watching three men in stilts acting a fool, while a very attractive female in a bikini & thong (truly sexy as hell) takes a dip into a giant green-filled margarita blender while also doing a Cirque du Soleil-type of performance on a giant hook afterwards. Its worth seeing while you await your drinks & dinner!  The servers were really attentive, and seemed to be enjoying what they do. And of course, you get to hear a lot of Jimmy Buffet's biggest hits on the large screens all around the venue. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on The Strip that I'll easily return to!",

Service was slow and left much to be desired.",

    "text": "When a night in Vegas goes wrong, there's always Margaritaville for dependable, hilarious fun.  While I've only eaten here late-ish and usually partially intoxicated, the food has always been delicious. My favorite by far is always the nachos; piled high with cheese and toppins', it's the perfect late-night snack. I vaguely remember having a burger at one point and it was delicious as well.  The staff has a great sense of humor; the first time I came here, my friend spent most of the night dancing with a feather duster and sat with it perched on his lap. Our waitress didn't miss a beat, asking him what he wanted to drink and if his \"date\" would like any libations. Drinks are a little small IMHO, but usually I can ask for a \"heavier\" pour and I have no problem being happily tipsy within 2-3.  Music is loud and a nice break from the club scene in Vegas. Crowd is a mix of ages, which I actually enjoy, because you get to see every type of person from different generations dancing along to the live band. Crowd is super laid back and much more relaxed than a lot of places in Vegas. Never has a pretentious vibe, and I've been here in full clubbing attire down to a tank top and shorts; all times have been unique but so fun. Love to dance all night long.  Between my college years exploring Vegas for the first time, to my current monthly visits for foodie dinners and days by the pool, I've had a fantastic experience every single time I've been here. While my normal ratchetry now includes less items \"borrowed\" off of maids carts, every time has been a pleasure, telling me it's not an accident this place is still so popular.   Don't be fooled by the tourist-trap-y vibe you might get from Margaritaville - it's fully worth/necessary to make a stop here. Will be back in short order for more nachos & dancing!",

The people walking around with stilts were scary, awkward, out of place, and I felt was irrelevant to the theme...unless the theme was \"tacky\".   And then there was this hot mess of a \"waiter\" dancing around to the music and doing some flashdance ridiculous dance routine while trying to \"pump up\" the customers.  I was not impressed.  After 10 minutes of painfully sitting through the awkward dancing, the lady climbs the roof of the bar and then slides into a green margarita tank that supposedly resembled a blender.  WTF?  Bad choreography, bad music, and seriously...I lost my appetite watching some hot mess of a girl swimming half naked in a green blender right near my food.  I clapped when the \"performance\" was over, only because I was thankful that she left the floor and I don't need her dripping around my food.",

My two girlfriends and I went in for a quick bite to re-energize for the long night of partying that was ahead of us, but we all felt so sick to our stomachs after eating our meals that we barely made it out that night. NOT my idea of a good time. It was awful, and I called to let the manager know that we were very unsatisfied with our meals (it was expensive!) but the manager never returned my call. I think that upset me the most.    Now, we're college girls. We are NOT picky about food. My Cheeseburger In Paradise looked like a Quarter Pounder from McDonalds, which would have been fine if it had tasted as good as a Quarter Pounder.  It was gross. I ate less than half of it and had to stop because I was already feeling sick.  Very disappointing. And my friend couldn't swallow more than four bites of her taco salad.

    "text": "Was just in Vegas again last month & I figured I'd write a review since they changed the menu recently. New menu is a little smaller, and isn't exactly as pescatarian/ vegetarian friendly as it used to be. They took off some of the pasta dishes and mushroom burger. I mostly come here for the drink and atmosphere so I made do. I ordered the caesar salad with no chicken, which was pretty good! Good dressing and the top it with fried onions - yum! It adds a nice texture to an otherwise boring dish. I do eat fish, so I also ordered a crab cake and the fish tacos at a different meal. The crab cakes were alright, but being from New England, they just don't compare. But, I would order them again if I were in the mood for one. The fish tacos were great, although I wish they offered the option of grilled fish instead of deep fried as I'm not a big fan of fried food, but they were still really good and I'd definitely order them on our next trip!   They have expanded the seating and now have open air seating overlooking the Quad. I prefer to sit upstairs, but it's a nice alternative when the upstairs desk is closed.   I highly recommend the 5 O'Clock Somewhere and the Perfect Margarita (the perfect margarita is loaded with alcohol though...in the desert heat I became dehydrated and lightheaded very quickly after drinking a couple of these in the span of a few hours.....be sure to ask for a water with it!)  They used to do a pretty good breakfast, but it looks like they aren't doing it anymore (?) Too bad - we definitely would have gone!   Definitely a place to stop at least once on your Vegas trip, even if just for a drink and the atmosphere. If you go at night, they have live music. It's really loud, so don't plan on having a conversation with your group, but it's great if you want to go dance without going to a club.",

Yikes! the prices were out of this world! $14 for a burger and fries, seriously?! I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and order anyways, dumb choice. The food is just mediocre and the prices on the high side for sure.  I ordered a chicken burger with onion rings. You get 4 onion rings exactly because they are large ones. And my chicken tasted like it had been taken out of the freezer, boiled and slapped on a bun. So not impressed, and not enough food on the plate for the price.  My husband had a mushroom burger ($14) with fries. Cold fries and a very slim portion, come on people thats the cheapest part of the meal! Burger was very average.  Decor is kind of intersting and was seated quickly. Also the drinks are just as over priced as the food. You are clearly paying for the brand name of this establishment when you pay your check. There are other and better values in Vegas. I will not be eating there again next time Im in town.",

Again, a little pricey... but you're in Las Vegas, center strip.  Deal with it.  This is a very convenient place to stop while passing by.  There is PLENTY of bar real estate whether you want to stop and sit to drink or run up to the \"to-go\" counter and order one (or two) for the road.  The service has always been incredible and the entertainment in the evenings is loud and wild and fun.  I'm pretty sure my father-in-law is still thinking about the Volcano girl that slides down into the giant margarita during dinner hours.  If you're in the area - stop in.  Order a burger.  Douse it in Heinz 57... Jimmy Buffet would be proud.  And kick back some margaritas.  It all makes for a very good time.",

Nothing too fancy, but nice enough for the tourists venturing through the strip.  I ate here with a group that wasn't too adventurous (but wanted something non-buffet); the menu is pretty straightforward so I opted for the beef and mushroom fajita.  It was ginormous and very very filling.  Although it wasn't anything super sophisticated, it was very satisfying and tasty... much like Vegas in general lol.",

The whole place vibe is full on Margaritaville, with the fishing pole hanging from everything. Seating ensemble a boat. The music was great with the video showing on huge flatscreen tv. Service was nice and friendly.   The food was ok, I was ordered the famous fried chicken meal. Um, it was not worth it. When you think fried chicken, you want bone in and all. They were chicken breast more like chick patties. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes was good. Margaritas was ok, nothing to rave about.   It's basically a tourist trap. Not typically a place I would visit but hey, what the heck. Something new and worth giving it a shot. Food wise, I probably would come back for it but drinks with friends on the patio would be ok.",

I am a new local in town so me and my girl wanted to drive down the strip looking at the different food places and what not, we where stuck between bubba Gump and Margaritaville we pick Margaritaville which was the best choice considering we both had bubba gump before in different states.   Our waiter was great very caring, kind and friendly he was fast and efficient, the food was some of the best I had away from the ocean. I was able to taste all the flavors. I hate coleslaw but given how everything else was tasting so amazing, I gave it a shot and I liked it to the point I even ate it.   I almost forgot their was one thing we were disappointed about and that was my girlfriends shrimp, so some of them had tails and some did not, also the one shrimp I tried had all the shell still on it. Other then that I would give five stars but the food was still amazing and worth re visiting.

The mashed potatoes were on the bland side; however, I love mashed potatoes so I was fine with them.  Could've used a big pat of butter, but doesn't everything taste better with butter?  YES.  Margaritas were delicious.  The high point of the whole meal.  I'm sure this place gets pretty lively at night - the full Margaritaville experience.  I probably won't come back here on purpose, although if I do find myself here again (through no fault of my own), I wouldn't be opposed to it.  I'd just try something different.",

In the dying, dirty Flamingo, sharing a parking garage with the beautuful, classy Cromwell, Margaritaville had soiled, open trash cans in the dining room, cheap furniture, no tropical colors, few nautical touches and prices way to proud of the mediocre bar food, cafeteria environment and sweet margaritas with sparse salt. I expected something like the old Bahama Breeze, but it's more like Applebee's without booths. The music was barely audible over the crowd noise, and wasn't all Jimmy. Service was okay, but unenthusiastic. Surprisingly, we had much better food and service at the Main Street Station buffet the next night. Don't waste your money at Margaritaville. Even Toby Keith's I Love this Bar had Margaritaville beat by miles and it closed most of its locations.",

My friends and I ordered uptown margarita, last mango in paris margarita, tropical fruit margarita and perfect margarita. We all agreed that drinks weren't good, they contained very small amount of alcohol and come in regular drinking cups; not the margarita glasses.   For appetizers, we ordered spinach artichoke dip and for my entree, I had the Jimmy's Jammin Jambalaya. The food is not great at all, BUT service makes up for everything. We had a fantastic waiter and interesting live entertainment. There's a mini show happening every 30 min-1 hour. There's two guys and one lady on walking stilts singing and a blondie dancing around. The finale is when she slides down a volcano into a huge cup of margarita at the bar section. I bet she changes into 15-20 bikinis a day!!!! Poor thing.. When they're not performing, they're crafting balloons for everyone. They made a bow and arrow for me. It was my friend's birthday so they made her a crown  with two hearts and the sign 21 on it. They're super funny and entertaining! Love it!",

We also sit at the bar and enjoy talking to the bartenders. They are fun bunch up there and make the night enjoyable.   Recently they added breakfast here and I was able to swing buy and grab a bite before work. I sat at the bar on the second floor and the bartenders that worked up there were fantastic. I had an amazing 3 egg white omelet is so nice not to eat at an all you can eat buffet in Vegas. The cooked to order breakfast was really good. I was amazed to see other people at the bar drinking Margarita's at 9am...I guess that is how you start your day in the desert of sin city...my liver was hurting for them.",

It's amazing how you can account the cost for a pre-made frozen hamburger patty that cost 15.00. Not cooked all the way thru, asked for may, mustard  and no garnish. Had to wait over 8 min for the waitress to come. Ack to the table after the food was served and by the time I received the mayo and mustard was well over 11 min in total.  By that time my burger was cool/warm and the frys were not even warm when originally delivered. Hubbies chicken strips were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside..so not done on the inside. Ordered iced tea which had hearty amount of ice but when the second glass came no ice. So very disappointed cause we have always had good service at this restaurant",

This place lies in the middle of the mega hotel/casinos on Las Vegas Blvd, its multi-leveled, upper floor open dining area (great view of the casinos, people and action along the strip), features live bands, alcohol and decent food!   Volcano Nachos: includes chili cheese, guac, sour cream, ooey gooey cheeses, jalapenos, tomatoes and scallions.. Optional grilled chicken and fajita steak. opt for the griled chicken and fajita steak (we half chicken and steak). Its a massive amount of one of the ultimate starter nachos I've had! Great to munch on while sippin' on a drink and it should satisfy at least 4 people!  Jimmy's Jammin' Jamabalaya: Cajun rice, shrimp, chicken, and andouille sausage \"simmered in a spicy broth\".. Does that sound good or what! I've only had a few versions of Jambalaya and never been disappointed. Their version more than satisfied! The rice absorbed the broth and married its flavors into all the meats making every bite, flavored packed! Not only super tasty, portion could be split with another person.   Servers/Bartenders were always giddy and helpful. Value of dining was good and most of all the location is hard to top!",

I love the casual atmosphere and the decor was very thematic to the whole margarita vibe. The drinks were very good. I had the bluberry pomegranate nojito and my husband had some banana flavored drink.  We ordered the nachos and seafood mac and cheese. I guess after a hangover the food is excellent. The nachos definitely was getting ordered everywhere and it was fun to eat. The mac and cheese though was so so. It did have a good portion of seafood but I just felt it was a little bland.   Service is excellent so no complaints there. Our server was very polite and attentive, and our food came out in a timely manner.   I do have one pet peeve, the design of the restaurant makes it hard to find the actual entrance.",

The Host staff was having a bad day and did not want to be at work.  We had 7 in the group and it took 40 minutes to get seated at 2 round tables.  They seat several groups of 5 & 6  before us (they came in after us)  They could have seated us right away if they planned to give us 2 tables.  We could not talk with the other table and it made it tough to share nachos.  Food was great and Jeff our server was awesome!  He made up fro the poor host staff.  Not sure I will take friends to Margaritaville for a while.  We would have stayed longer and spent more but we went somewhere else so we could seat together.",

There is live entertainment in the form of a small production where a girl jumps into a small glass pool. It does get crowded and the lines are long, but you can always drink while you wait...and trust me you'll want a drink.   Plus Jimmy Buffet music in the background....perfect. \"I got two pina coladas....one for each hand...\"",

He happened upon Margaritaville when a girl handed us and card with drink specials outside so we thought, why not? We sat in the back and ordered up a few margaritas and pina coladas. Everything was definitely tasty and if I was ever to set foot in here again, I'd want to be sitting in one of those cute little boat tables.   We came back the next night night to have a few more tasty bevies and my only complaint is, my boyfriend had left his phone on the bar (there was nobody else sitting at or around the bar but us and a bartender behind the bar) we were in deep conversation so he didn't notice till we were about to leave, that his phone was gone. He spoke to the bartender who refused to be any help whatsoever. He wouldn't check the cameras or do anything to help the situation. We were not impressed with this at all and the're only a few directions to point at since the only people in close vicinity was us and the bartender.   This incident kinda soured me toward these kinds of Vegas establishments.",

Their drinks were nice and stiff. The bartenders were especially cool and a lot of fun. They did not offer many things in the gluten free area, so this limited my dining options. I did eat breakfast there several times. The corned beef hash and bacon were good. The boatmeal was good and came with a huge bowl of berries. My favorite was the nachos. The nacos were overloaded and would easily serve four people. I highly recommend stopping in just to check it out. Their casino was fun. They steer you through their retial shop and casino to exit. Also, be sure to get a seat on their massive patio. Awesome weather and people watching!",

Parrot Heads Beware, at 9 PM the extremely loud obnoxious bam bam bam dance music starts, and there is no more conversation. Taking some lawyer friends out for drinks and conversation, it was over when the music started.  You couldn't hear the server, and were yelling across the table to communicate.  Nothing like the terrific bands they had in the past. If the management thinks putting in this obnoxious music will increase business, they need to go out a look at their client demographic.  I will not go back as long as they continue to ruin the Jimmy Buffett atmosphere.  In my view, a horrible business decision.  Dozens of guest around us were all upset at the volume and music choice in this once clearly themed venue.",

From the sea floor, or the boat seats. There's a giant screen that plays video clips and music videos to an array of mostly country songs.

So when we were hungry one night, we went in here. I now wish we hadn't.   We were seated at a table, it was kind of dark, but that's okay. There was a band playing... loudly and it wasn't the type of music I figured would be in Margaritaville. I came here hoping for something Jimmy. I understand that they can't play all Jimmy all the time, but I was hoping as it was a weeknight to hear some, even if it was a cover band.   Of course being the fan boy that I am, I had to get the Cheeseburger in Paradise. My wife got the filet. (I love a woman that eats steak!). Neither one of us was impressed with our meal. I thought the burger was kind of plain, even with the Heinz 57 on it (I admitted I was a fan boy!).  The burger was kind of dry and not very appetizing. It could have used... something.  My wife said her filet was the same, just kind of eh, okay. Definitely not worth the price we paid for it.   The part that really killed this place for me was the service. We had the worst server of our vacation here. He was slow, didn't check up on us. Our drinks would go empty and we couldn't get refills. Even when we were finished we had to flag him down to come over to get a check, and then we had to wait to get that even longer.   Jimmy, I'm still a fan... but I'm not going back to this Margaritaville again.",

I had to send it back but when it did come back it was very hot, good and a big bowl. My salad never came, but that was good since the chili was enough. I was expecting a small bowl of chili for the price but it was bigger than I thought. Yes, I did mention  it was pricy but not the chili everyone else's food.  My wife ordered the fish tacos.

    "text": "This place rocks. It's a tons better than the Margaritavilles in Chicago and Nashville, It is comparable to the one I've been to at Niagara Falls in Canada though.   This place is huge, it has a Casino [of course] and a cute little bar off to the side on the sidewalks side for the passerby's on the strip to stop in and have a drink. They offer these amazing blends called \"Booze in a Blender\" all of them are sooooo good AND they get the job done without you even knowing! :]   The food is the same as all the others so I deducted a star for the lack of  a \"WoW\" moment but otherwise the staff is really friendly and courteous. The atmosphere is great as well, and although Vegas is surrounded by a dessert the shipwrecked theme somehow fits a lot better in here.   What you should definitely try to do though is go upstairs! You see a big chunk of the strip as you sip on your beverage of choice, so beautiful!!",

I got to Tropical Margarita GUAVA flavor and it was really good. Just a good balance of alcohol, tequila, and guava ! Blended of course! I was feeling a little ill so I ordered the tortilla soup which was pretty okay. My friends ordered the seafood mac and cheese and it had \"perfectly melted cheese both white and yellow cheese with the crisp\" It was so good they talked about it all weekend.  It was also fun to see someone come out of a volcano and slide into a giant pitcher!  Since it was touristy, prices were not cheap. $10 margaritas, and 20+ for mac and cheese! go figure :)",

I guess it's a sign.  A photo with the parrot costs $20.  Forget that.  How much are those Hawaiian shirts in the retail store?  $50?!  Ok, let's just get lunch.  How much will that cost us?    This is a pretty groovy and laid back place.  It's tropical island decor and there's a plane hanging from the ceiling.  We sat on a high table and checked out the map for Florida and watched the local crowd.  It was pretty packed for lunch.  We eyeballed the nachos as they passed us by but they were a bit too much for us so we got the fish burger and fish tacos.  I'm telling you; this fish thing is going strong.  All the way to Vegas.  I started off with their tortilla soup.  It was heavily spiced and there was a strong onion flavor that didn't agree with me.  I took a few bits and basically just couldn't stomach anymore.  The fish tacos were ok.  I didn't really care for the cilantro sour cream sauce and it was generous doused with it throughout my tacos.  Service was fast and friendly and we enjoyed the ambiance.",

The atmosphere is boardwalk casual. The servers are also very casual in their approach, but are decent.   The menu is a bit limited, but our food was served hot and tasted great. The portions were good but not overly large. Prices are very reasonable. Especially given the limited choices for breakfast on The Strip, I would recommend you try this restaurant.

As he is local he was full of great information to our questions about town and such.  To our delight all 6 of us agreed that the food here was more and better than we expected. My shrimp and grits were excellent. One of the better versions I have had. Others had burgers, fajitas and chicken fingers and everyone said good things while we enjoyed the food. The drinks here were also good. The portions and prices were right on and we left here full and content.

    "text": "Another adventure with a coupon. THANKS FIANCE. We had a deal from TravelZoo that was 2 Meals, 2 drinks for $35  Initial reaction: This place is touristy. At 2:30pm it is jam packed full of people. My fiance says, \"When in Vegas, people don't care about eating at normal times.\" Ok, Ok, I will give you that.   There was a long wait for a regular table, so we find a place at the high-top tables in the bar area, which is open seating. We snag a 6-person table for the 2 of us. We felt kind of bad, as we saw a larger group giving us a death glare but we were hungry after a terrible breakfast we had earlier in the day. The noise level was very high. I was sitting right next to my fiance and it was difficult to hear him.  The service was definitely slow, but I didn't see many servers in the bar/high top table area. Maybe they didn't expect it to be so crowded that late in the afternoon... Who knows, but we didn't see our server very often except to bring us our awful drinks, mediocre food, and finally our check. She was very nice, but I think she was spread too thin.  Those drinks though... Margaritaville LOVES sweet and sour mix. OMG, yuck-o-matic. Neither of us could drink them. Come on bartender, take it easy with the heavy hand. Ain't nobody gettin' tipsy off that.. diabetes maybe.  We ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad and the Cheeseburger in Paradise. We always split our entries so we each get to try a little bit of each item. The cheeseburger was pretty good, I think.. I have been on a diet for a while (#sheddingfortheweddingyall), so I could have just been craving something meaty and greasy. It did come out cold though, so it was probably sitting in the window for a while. The salad was ok, I didn't like the dressing that was on it so we ordered a side of ranch. I think it was a vinaigrette of some sort. Nothing particularly spectacular about the food. It was satisfying.",

Place is Buffet style like other locations and connected to a casino.  It won't knock your socks off - but it's clean, reasonable and polite.  What more can you ask for?  If you have more money go spend it - I suggest Cut - if you have less there is a Denny's down the street.  Watch out for the manic beard outside.  Walgreens is nearby if you want to buy liquor for your hotel room.",

Just go there for the nachos and water, skip the drinks and go somewhere else where it's cheaper and better portions.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying if it wasn't for my Mother I don't think I'd ever have stepped in here, but after my experience I actually am hooked and could even pass as a Parakeet. Haha!  The dining area inside is very massive. I mean no lie there were tables everywhere even a little closer than comfort to the bathrooms, but then again that isn't always a bad thing. We came on a Saturday evening and had no problems being sat so can't go wrong there. Keeps you from wasting away in Margaritaville. Ok ok, I promise that'll be it.   What I am impressed by is the food. I wasn't necessarily in the mood at the time to go to town so I set my heart on their wings because c'mon those to me are not that easy to nail as one thinks. I was in the island vibe so I went with the Caribbean jerk sauce rub and that is highly recommended. It has a slight kick to the \"coconuts\", but nothing to set off a 5 alarm fire in your mouth. It is actually one of the better jerk sauces I've experienced. As you can see in the picture there is a lot (I couldn't about 16 wings in mine) and the beauty is they are full sized wings. No teeny weeny pollo here. Next time I will dine on an empty stomach for sure!  There was pretty much a \"you name it we'll make it\" mentality here, but I was drawn to their moonshine favorite menu. I had the tropical thunder (well 3 because my mother called me out, but go figure it was our first time drinking together so we had a blast). Between the mix of blackberry/lemonade and blueberry pomegranate puree you certainly get the sweet, but the hunch punch moonshine provides the ground work for a night of memories. I can say they are creepers because I walked out with a mild buzz, but by Mirage I wanted to do my own fire show outside of the volcano. Can't go wrong with that?!?  Next time I'm Vegas I shall dawn my Hawaiian garb and partake in another round or two here with absolute pleasure. The atmosphere is electrifying and if I have to get electrocuted this way where do I sign?!?",

The gift shop which is attacheched to the restaurant has everything a parrot head, or in our case \"Keets\" could possibly want. We found what we were looking for and the kids were happy.   - Expensive, but so is Tommy Bahama.  - Well stocked and nicely organized. - The gift shop closes before the restaurant does.

Right in the middle of the strip so it's very easy to find if you're visiting. Service is a little slow as far as someone coming to the table after you sit and for the food to be brought out as well. My waitress this time was great though. Very helpful with recommendations and a nice cheerful personality.   I ordered the seafood Mac and cheese which I always enjoy. The sauce they use is good and it is flavorful.  I got a basic side salad which was fine. The spinach and artichoke appetizer is really good. That kind of dip can be hit or miss but I really enjoy theirs and would order it again for sure.   Lastly I got the tropical thunder drink. It tasted like straight fruit punch which may or may not be a good thing. I don't like when you can taste the alcohol very much so that was great but those type of drinks can sneak up on you and it's made with moonshine so be careful if you aren't much of a drinker or you could be crawling out after a couple of then. Delicious though and I would order it again for sure.",

Helped with some of the fan favorite entrees and drinks. Checked on us couple of times, after our food came too to make sure we didn't need anything else.   Did enjoy the set up from boat deck seating, to caves or deserted island set up all depending on where you got seated. We got the boat deck seating, with little window, steering wheel.",

I have been here about 4 or 5 times before I was a yelper.  I have had some fond memories here with my sisters and family. Specifically the night that we came in were were a part of a club crawl which meant drink specials they had going on was buy one get one.   I got two Strawberry Margaritas which was very tasty and I enjoyed it very much as well as my sister. We decided to get food as we were very hi hungry. We opted for the chicken nachos which were huge portions. We got conflicting information from the bartender that we can sit anywhere however the waitress informed us that we had to be formally seated. We were informed that our food would not be ready due to the crawl leaving to the next venue in which the host informed us that we had an hour so we ignored the waitress and had more than enough time to chow down on some Nachos.  They were very tasty and hit the spot for a night of fun and drinks. Besides the waitress incident I did enjoy my time here. The music is pretty good as they played some of my favorite jams.  I am looking forward to coming back and having many more drinks and fun times here.",

Atmosphere - Actually a pretty large restaurant but they reduce the space available to a little area for breakfast.  The theme is over the top, but you probably already knew that.  There are even boats on the dining area.  They pushed two tables together for us.  Both tables are square four person tables, but one the extenders flipped on three of the sides making the two tables look like a light bulb.  Just a very strange setup.  Food   Drink - I know restaurant coffee is not the best but I still order it.  Well they had to have some of the worse coffee I have ever had.  Do not worry no one came by to refill it.    Breakfast - Breakfast has 12 items on the menu.  I ordered the Chilaquiles.  As one of my family members stated those chips look like Doritos.  The chips could have been.  The chips are topped with two sunny eggs, and were buried with the rest of the toppings.  One of the eggs were cooked to the perfect sunny while the other was a solid yoke.  How do you manage to nail one egg but not the other?  Service - I know having 9 people at a table is a pain to deal.  But it seemed our waitress did not want to be there.  Future -I have a feeling it will be in my future with my protest.",

They have tons of cool t shirts and other items and make great souvenirs.",

The restaurant was hot AF and there were hardly any customers there. That should've been a red flag to turn around and walk away, but we didn't and things just got worse from there.   We ordered two waters and started browsing through the menu. 10-15mins later our waters still hadn't come out and we were sitting there fanning ourselves with the menu....waiting for our drinks, while multiple waitresses were just standing around talking to each other, ignoring the customers. The waitress finally came out with our waters and we were ready to order. I was told they didn't have all the components to make the sampler I ordered, so I asked what they had available to replace the item with and the waitress didn't know. She left again to find out more information and was gone for a while, then told me they had enough for another order. I don't know why I agreed to take it, the food was disgusting and taste like it was days old. Stay away!! Unprofessional staff, slow service and disgusting food!",

I've been here twice so far, both times I ordered the ahi seared tuna appetizer, calypso coconut fried shrimp and at least a couple pink cadillac margaritas...  I was more than pleased with my selections because when I come back for my 24th birthday that's exactly what I'm ordering again.   :)  Update: went back on my 24th bday (12/21) and did just that!

Please do not serve fish tacos with previously frozen tilapia...you may claim it is fresh, but farm raised fish seldom comes fresh and the texture showed it! Most people in Vegas are typically from somewhere in California and know what a True fish taco should be. For $16, you really ought to to put something better on the menu. If I need a spot to get a drink, this is it. If I need a spot for dinner, I am definitely going somewhere else...UPDATE - I am actually going to amend my review to a higher star due to the fact that the owner reached out to me as a result of my review and displayed a True concern over the experience. I will definitely try them again. The biggest reason? They clearly care about the level of their food and quality of the experience.",

My sister and I weren't feeling that great after some bad food at Buca di Beppo earlier in the day so we just ordered soup and salad.  The tortilla soup tasted like those Taco Bell seasoning packets, but it helped settle my stomach a little.  The salad was worse, the lettuce was dry and stale so neither of us ate it.  Also, we had a reservation for \"VIP seating\" but we still had to wait 20 minutes and the table was just like any other table in the middle of the place.  However - my aunt had a blast enjoying the Jimmy Buffett music videos and her birthday balloon hat, so that's why I give it 3 stars.",

It was really unfortunate that I had to come here on a full stomach from enjoying the Buffet at The Wynn.  Worked out for me though since that gave me a chance to soak up some of their crazy drinks.  I had their Bahama Mama, which was rum filled concoction, and it was really good.  We all shared the Volcano Nachos with grilled chicken which if you've seen the pics (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rTS8...</a>), is a monster!  It's really too bad that I didn't get to try their food here as it looks like they give massive portions based on everyone pics.  So why 4 stars if I haven't had their food?  The overall atmosphere of the place worked for me.  It was very relaxed and chill and the entertainment inside was fun and not too over the top.  Great place to eat or hang out with friends.",

Needless to say, this was not my choice. Mom & Aunt wanted to go here SO BADLY, and apparently everyone else in Vegas did too, as the wait time for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday was an hour and half.   When we finally did get in (seated at a table with its own video monitor - hooray!), we ordered and got our food approx. 45 minutes after that. You'd think after waiting for so long that anything I ate would be good, but that was not the case. The nachos and chicken strips were horrific, people. NACHOS. How do you F up nachos and chicken strips?? HELLO.   In fact I think the only person who liked what they ordered was my aunt, who had the steak - and whose love of Jimmy Buffet made the whole place seem like Paradise to her (I refuse to make the obvious cheeseburger joke here!).   I went here in the Spring of 2008, and just recently walked by on my last Vegas trip and it was still as packed now as it was then - all day, everyday. I have no idea what the draw of this place is, but I will NEVER be going back.",

When we went they did the whole thing where the hot girl jumps in the margarita tank and the volcano erupts. Its for the tourists and the kids, really.   Anyways. The food is okay. Its just an over-priced burger joint. I've had a veggie burger. Nothing fancy to it. Same with the coconut shrimp served with orange marmalade, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Its SUPPOSED to be one of their specialties. Big fat MEH.   The service is always friendly and the bathrooms are clean. But I still kind of feel like the place is trashy.   The frou-frou margaritas are pretty good. But they better be for $8-10. And since \"margarita\" is in the name of the joint.   Parking is kinda crappy. The closest parking is in the structure NEXT door to Flamingo's. O'Shea's is in the same building. But every time I've been, you almost have to drive to the roof to get parking. And the lot is damn confusing. Then you have to walk across the alley, passing the big dumpster behind Margaritaville which smells like dying animals. Enjoy!",

We started off with drinks; I got my wife a \"Perfect Margarita\" which was very strong on the liquor and the price. Yet, if you can get buzzed off of just one drink than you paid mostly for liquor so I would call it an even trade. I had a Bahama Mama that was fair to midland, I could have done without the drink. I didn't have a lot of hope for the food just by looking at the menu. I ended up ordering the Jambalaya which did not look like Jambalaya that I have seen in photos but it did taste good and I ended up taking the other half home with me to eat later. Since we had a group of 6 we decided to have some chips and salsa (which in my experience you don't get charged for) and they ended up charging it for us so me and my wife along with our drinks spent about $70 together for lunch. I ate for much cheaper in Vegas at other locations. I would not say this place was bad, it is what it is but if I want to get a better deal I will look around if I can.",

We also split the conch fritters to get a taste of key west.  We hung out and watched the band for a little bit and the people dancing.  Great times!  After dinner and a few more drinks, we went into the gift shop.  I was looking for a shirt I had seen in Key West a couple weeks before, but was disappointed when I found out they didn't have it.  A male employee approached and asked if I was finding everything ok, when I told him my story he said I could order it online.  We asked me to hold on and went off somewhere.  A few minutes later he returned with a printed out page of the shirt I wanted as well as the phone number for Key West.  I didn't get his name but I did ask if he was the manager, and he said he was the supervisor.  What great service!  After the gift shop we hit the casino and the bar.  I like when bartenders do tricks while serving the drinks!  What a great time I highly recommend Margaritaville!",

She could've learned to smile JUST a bit and took a good long time to take care of us. That, and I really don't care much for Jimmy...and his music got old by the time we left.

Food was fine, service good and atmosphere excellent.  It is what it is and it does it well.  We visited on a rainy late Saturday morning and the place was empty.  Having walked past the Strip-facing balconies on many a hot Vegas afternoon, I have no doubt that the place goes off under the right conditions.    And by \"goes off,\" I mean fills with midwestern 30 and 40 somethings livin' on sponge cake and watchin' the sun bake (see, . . . cuz. . .) while hopped up on sugary-likkery-goodness.

When we finally were seated an hour later, we ordered drinks, which were ok. My boyfriend got a bartender's margarita, and ironically, he said it was one of the worst ones he'd ever had. I'm partial to sweet drinks, but even mine was so sweet I had a hard time getting it down.   Our food was pretty good, and the strange people on stilts (I didn't get it) were nice, albeit a little creepy. I think we both went here to say we'd been, but I doubt we'll go again next time we're in Vegas. If for no other reason, than I don't know if I could listen to that many Jimmy Buffet songs in a row again.",

Didn't disappoint...huge mound of chips, chili, salsa, guacamole, jalapenos and the only complaint was the lower chips went soggy too fast.  Very reasonably priced and large food portions.  The bucket o beers were a decent deal, knocked a few bucks off the total for 5 beers.    Boating theme inside with large screens playing Buffet videos.  The place got packed at lunch time and a lot of people were having the nachos too.  Recommended but bring an appetite.",

I had the wings one time - yuck. The next time I had the Volcano nachos. Those were actually okay but a TON of food. Get those for like 4 people, not as an entree for one haha.   But what I love most about this place is the atmosphere! I've been here twice and we've sat on the upstairs patio both times. Once at night and once during lunch. It's absolutely beautiful at both day and night and you can here all the noise from the strip - it's lovely. I'll eat here again but only because I love the drinks and the view from that patio is one of my favorites!",

I asked the 2nd hostess how to get to the bar, and if the restaurant was open.  She was more patient but still curt.... & explained how the restaurant doesn't open til 5pm.  Then they have 2 bars downstairs and 1 upstairs.  So in a city where service is \"the economy\" and it could've been a great experience.  This place is an epic fail.

I used to come here when I was 21 too and its everything that a freshly minted legal aged young person could ever want. Its a relaxed place... its fun, and there is no pretentiousness. Drinks are mid strip price... not really a place for bargain hunters but it won't matter. If you come here you've got your credit card and are tipsy enough not to worry about whether or not you've got a coupon. Its attached to the Flamingo - a good value slightly upscale hotel that attracts younger people. Trust me... it will be less expensive to spend time having a few here than in the casino with the one armed bandits - give this place a try and buy a shirt from the gift shop so you remember the good times you had here every time you wear the shirt.",

I'd say if that Bill T. guy was partying at the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar with us than he would of for sure had fun too! This location is HUGE so I can see how you would get different service depending on where you sit. Also Billy the Bartender made the experience much more enjoyable.  We pretty much walked into the first Mexican themed place that we saw which just so happen to be Margaritaville. Sat down at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Billy. His energy is off the wall! Brought out the energy in us! LOL! Of course we ended up partying with the people we were sitting next to which became 1 big party. Awesome atmosphere. Almost every person that I saw hanging out in there had a huge smile!  Billy the Bartender suggested we try the FRYCHOS basically nachos but with Fries, which weren't anywhere on the menu but I was able to request for it from the kitchen for the same price! They were the BOMB! Def hit the spot for my hang over! We also ordered shrimp skewers that weren't the best & very overpriced.   The drinks were tasty buuuut more so STRONG!  All the staff I came across was outstanding!  Thank you Margaritaville & Billy for showing us an awesome Cinco De Mayo! We definitely will be back to party again!! :)",

After having to go ask someone up front to get our server, finally our server came by and got our order.. with no apology for the wait.  We ordered a burger and wings. Our burger came out wrong. Our server never came back to check on us.. so we pushed the burger to the edge of the table. Finally another 20 minutes later, he came by and asked how things were..  After we told him everything that we were mad about, he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fix it. Just said he would comp our bill, and walked away!!!",

We almost left without dessert but decided to have a slice of key lime pie to share. I definitely recommend the pie. While the dinner was very good the pie was amazing. Very citrusy and the side of whipped cream was perfect. All in all this is recommended and we will come back next time we are here.

Cool, so they sat us with a view of the strip... Cool, what that meant is a view of the walk next to the strip.  Whatever the nachos are great so it's worth it right? 25 minutes later no one looked at us so we're out. Manager said someone went home so they got confused... Usually don't write reviews for bad service but they sat us well after they knew the server Left. Done with them.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Margaritaville and I will start by saying that I do not drink, so I cant speak to that aspect of the establishment.  We came in to the restaurant right as they were opening and got in to a table quickly, they were very accommodating of our 10 month twins, and they have the nicest high chairs we have had in a restaurant, plastic and comfortable with a descent strap (while most places have those token wood ones) Other than the initial greeting the service want too great and the server did seem a bit annoyed that we kept asking for things like refills or a side of ranch since my wife didn't care for their raspberry vinaigrette.  I or course ordered the coconut shrimp, as I love a good coconut shrimp and have always heard they have the best! I have had their Costco frozen ones which are actually pretty good, but these things were just awesome! They were huge and oh so tasty! The dipping sauce was really good though a bit heavy on the horseradish, and they only give you a tiny ramekin so I have to get a second one to finish out my shrimp. The fries were also really tasty; perfectly crispy and well seasoned.  My wife ordered a burger of some kind but I honestly cant remember what was on it, but again it was pretty tasty, a bit undercooked for her taste (and what she asked for) but would have been perfect for me. She still liked it though, and it was a nice big burger with lots of tasty toppings.  The atmosphere was really cool and though a bit run down it wasn't as cheesy as it could have been, we were sat in that back of what looked like a fishing boat so that was fun too. I will certainly go to a Margaritaville again if I am near one, and though (like everything in Vegas) it was quite overpriced, I think it was worth it.",

Why? because I have had some encounters here in the past that werent EPIC but..my experience definitely changed after sitting down at the bar and being helped by Ryan. Not only was he spot on with his drink pours but he totally engaged me asked my name and has killer dimples and a smile that seems legit genuine.. I can only imagine nobody WANTS to spend their holiday pouring drinks to a bunch of tourists or WHINEY locals like myself haha but he asked my name... legit talked NBA trades with me and gave me excellent advice on drinks.. The Cadillac Margarita is to die for... I definitely recommend seeking out Ryan if youre at the bar.. Now if you are dining in I would ask for Tess... Why? because she legit was super friendly and was not even my server but had to go back and fourth to get drinks and food and stuff but she was still willing to give me good service ..  plus she scored points since she gave a smile back  when I gave one to her which as females we ALL know that is a Nice female and was friendly and genuinely happy to give me her name when I asked... This was a fun time where I was able to get a nice buzz while not being harassed by douche tards and even got some delicious drinks.. The house band plays some interesting stuff but it isn't terrible on the ears either.. I may have to venture back to see the water ladies dance sometime.... Anyhow whoever is staffing this place seems to be doing a good job keeping at least two of their employees happy because they did an epic job!",

The decor is cleverly made up of fishing boats and island life, and there were pirates on stilts and a little island girl swinging from a hook. We highly recommend this restaurant for it's fun atmosphere, delicious food, and great service!!!",

    "text": "I have to say, I really had a great time at this restaurant!  We started off at the bar, and had a margarita.  Yeah, they are a bit pricey, but man, they were worth it!  Then, we were finally seated, and ordered drinks at our table (after we finished our margaritas)..  Then came the insanity.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and I swear it could have been a meal for both of us.  The platter was HUGE, and the nachos were overflowing the plate!  It was amazing - and they tasted very good too!  The rest of the food was excellent too.  The burgers and the chicken were spot on!  And it was fun to watch the insanity that goes on around in this place.  I think this place is better off for the atmosphere itself, but the food does not take anything away either.  It's plenty different from all the other restaurants on the strip, but if you are looking to have some fun, and a good meal, how could you go wrong in Margaritaville??  ....wasting away in margaritaville.....",

    "text": "My friend and I ate here this weekend. After waiting for about 15 minutes we got a table. The restaurant will give you a buzzer to hold onto and it will light up once you get a table.  Food: Ample, AMPLE portions. In fact, I struggled to eat most of it and had about 1/3 of my chicken meat left and another 1/3 of my rice left. I couldn't finish my plate because it was so huge. I ordered the chicken fajitas and it came with 4 wraps, rice, guacamole, sour cream, veggies, lettuce, and cheese. I also had the crab and mushroom dip with bread. It was very good. The bread was a bit buttery, but you can't really expect otherwise.  Service: The waitress was pretty good. She came by a few times to make sure we had water and our needs were met. Another girl with Hawaiian gear and accessories came by to ask if we wanted to donate money for breast cancer awareness \"tata\" organization. The Hawaiian necklaces were cute and you get it by donating $15+ to the organization.  Music: There is music along with imagery on repeat mode within the television screens in the restaurant. There's also live music and some performances (e.g. dancing) on the mini stage at the end of the restaurant. There is music playing in the bar section of the place even though I didn't sit there.  Seating: I wanted to comment about this because they couldn't accommodate us to sit at a regular table. As a result, my friend and I sat next to each other in a \"bar\" style table even though we wanted to sit in a regular booth/table. Minus 1 star for that.  Pricing: Prices are reasonable and the portions are ample. I think the food they serve at this restaurant is similar to some of the other \"chains\" in Las Vegas such as Hard Rock or Rainforest Cafe. It's still very good food and you can be assured that there's a certain level of quality to it.  Location: Near Harrah's and OShea's (on same side of the street). Convenient location across from Ceasar Palace - center strip.   Parking: There is parking available next door in the Flamingo Hilton/O Shea's casino parking lot (free of charge). Make sure you take note on where you parked as it can be a bit confusing if you don't remember.  I need to go back to try their margarita and probably should've ordered once since it's \"Margaritaville\" after all. Also, I loved the \"Hawaiian/hang loose\" atmosphere at this place.",

    "text": "Just trying to find an alternative to the incredibly overpriced restaurants on the strip was a challenge.  We tried Margaritaville but the menu was really limited and still over-priced.  I ended up with the fish tacos which was probably one of the best values on the menu.  For around $17 I got two small pieces of tasty and tender battered white fish in two soft tacos with a large portion of black beans and rice.  The coleslaw they mention on he menu is a small spoonful placed on the fish in the taco.  Not enough to get you full but the rice and beans will help.  I asked for butter and it was flavored and helped with the bland beans and rice.  My son got a burger which was off the kids menu.  We opted to skip a third meal or desert.  We ended up paying around $26 plus tip.  The had a girl slide down a huge display into a gigantic champagne glass and flaunt around in it for a few minutes.  All the guys loved that as she had a rockin' body.  They had a gigantic Margaritas that 4-6 people could share so if you want to get your drink on, this could be fun.",

That's right folks, no parrot head here!   Well I eat my words. What started off as just grabbing a drink here as a joke and to tell my ex that I finally went to Margaritaville turned into a couple hours of good times. My friend and I were lucky enough to get seats at the bar near the open patio and service was superb. The bartender we had was so attentive and when he was busy the other bartenders would check on us. I forget what I had to drink there but I do know it was decent. Decent meaning that I could taste alcohol but not too much alochol and not a ton of mixer or juice. We only ordered an appetizer and I believe it was a crab or lobster dip. Um, can you say awesome?!? A woman next to us ordered the nachos and I was drooling just watching her eat them. Although I dont know how she ate them herself because those nachos are enough to feed 4 people.

Who cares that we were totally overdressed, it was just wonderful to have a place where a margarita cost $7.50 (especially after paying twice that much for a beer elsewhere).    Going in the later hours of the night / early hours of the morning, there were no lines (in stark contrast to all clubs), there was a live band (not a DJ), and plenty of places to sit where you didn't have to pay the cost of a used car.  The margaritas were good, strong, and priced to impress.  Same goes for the frozen margarita/sangria concoction my friend got that was nothing short of wonderful.  Had a great time here.",

We sat at the bar and just got a drink menu so I don't know about the food and might have to try that out someday. The staff was friendly and the place was clean inside. After 1 drink we decided to head to another place where we could get more drink for our buck.  I really had high hopes for this place and wish I could write a  better review but I have to be honest based on my experience.",

Thumbing through the menu, there were numerous items that sounded appetizing. Then... Cheeseburger in Paradise appears on the menu. It even had the circled R, indicating trademark... as in THE Cheeseburger in Paradise. I haven't had a CIB burger since my last trip to Hawaii, and they are good. When the burger came, it was every bite of deliciousness I had remembered. I wish I paid attention to our server's name, because she was fabulous - an older woman with short hair. She rocked. I don't typically have a \"to do\" list when we come to Vegas, but Margaritaville will now be a mandatory stop.",

    "text": "Margaritaville seemed like the perfect choice after listening to country music for 3 hours while beginning Vegas with your partner in crime from Tennessee. I love my country music, but Margaritaville is a bit outdated. Decor didn't seem all that realistic, and the Volcano wasn't very impressive.   Food-wise, nothing stood out. Burgers, quesadillas, and the famous mountainous nachos. The nachos are definitely hefty, I'll give you that, but then again you might not want to remember after downing pepto bismol. They have a wide range of margarita flavors, and you can even get the huge souvenir glass, which will only gather dust sitting on that already cluttered shelf at home, for around $35! Yes, it comes with the alcohol, but that just sounds insane to me. Maybe I was still warming up to Vegas prices, but I prefer getting my margaritas from Fat Tuesday, where you can get 48oz of an Everlear concoction for a fraction of that price. More bang for your buck for sure.   I can only stand so much of watching Jimmy Buffet in concert at the beach, so unfortunately this was a no-go for me. In their defense, I hear it's a lot more lively at night, and there are performers at the restaurant. Otherwise, please skip! There are way too many better restaurants at Vegas! Unless of course you are one of those half naked people at the Jimmy Buffet concert and want to relive those days.",

When we informed her of the situation she was very passive aggressive and took the plate and then had us pay gratuity!

The prices are a little steep...but the food was great I had a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was cooked to profession.  My drink that I had was really good and strong.  I had a good buzz to leave with.  Our server was awesome she made suggestions to us since we never at there before and she was very fun.  This will be one of the places I will go again when I'm back in Vegas",

    "text": "There are some restaurants in Vegas that flash tourist trap, tourist trap, and yes we fell into this one.  WIth a coupon for $5 off from our hotel, we had our first meal in Vegas at the famous Margarittaville.  It's not the same as going to the one in Jamaica where you are in a hot locale and it seems like the right place to hear Margarittaville but the menu seemed the same. You walk in and you are likely to see large screens with either music videos, or recordings of Jimmy singing in different venues.  It's a bit loud but that is to be expected.  You'll probably see one of 3 people on stilts walking around.  I'm not really sure their purpose besides being available for picture taking and the occasional dance to a song.  I decided on the fish tacos; two tacos with lettuce, grilled fish, and sour cream, served with chips and salsa for $15.99.  The fish could have used a little more flavour but overall they were pretty tasty.  My husband ordered steak and I asked him to add the coconut shrimp for an extra $6 so I can try it.  Three shrimp with a tangy sauce accompanied his meal and they were good but I was glad it wasn't my meal as it would have been too much shrimp and sauce.  I don't think this place needs to be visited more than once during a stay in Vegas and once every few years is probably enough considering all the great places to eat.  But this time, I wasn't disappointed and our server was friendly and provided great service.",

The idea of a club sounds good, but when so much meat and bread is put on the sandwich, it's not only impossible to eat, but not good as well. Plus the meat was very cold. Service wasn't good either. The guy was very slow in getting drinks as well as refilling them.  We got to see a \"show\" which was kind of cool I guess. A lady came out of the volcano and spun around on a fish hook. Took my mind off the disgusting sandwich that I had.  The last time I was at a Margaritaville, I told myself \"never again\". Well, I stupidly went against my own advice and ate here. But I'll say it again and hopefully listen to my own advice. NEVER AGAIN!",

He crumpled the receipt up and threw it of the bar counter along with the change lol.  I usually tip my bartenders no less than $2 per drink but this guy was rude and uninviting right off the bat.  It seemed like he was checked out and ready to end his day.  Will never return to this place id rather give my money to the rundown Marilyn Monroe on drugs that was  outside...atleast she was smiling and greeting tourists SMH.",

Although I did receive a response to my initial posting, my second experience was much more memorable. Everyone has a bad day, but customer service should always be put first.   I still stand by my initial recommendation of the chicken tacos - the meat really was divine even the second time around. Next time, in going to see if they can put it on a salad!",

I did not have food here, just a drink.  I ordered the blender-sized 35 oz margarita which was then filled with a few of the slurpee-like liquids of peach, mango, and lime.   The drink was SO sweet, I could barely drink the thing. I could not taste any alcohol, just sugar. I started actually getting heart burn about half way through.  As my fiance put it: \"I was hung over, before I was even buzzed\".  72 dollars later for 2 drinks that were painful to drink, I realize the 13 dollar bong-looking beverages that you can get refilled nearly anywhere on the strip are much better and generally have more liquor and taste nicer on the tongue too.  Less financial heartburn, I might add. Stay away from this bar/walk in place unless you're looking to carry a giant mug that says \"Schmuck\".",

Given that I had children with me I would assumed she would offer to seat me on the main floor where the entertainers in stilts are walking around but I guess not. Other than that very nice place.",

Entree time: Beach Club sandwich. I love a good club sandwich.

The first time I ordered the Peel and Eat chilled Shrimp appetizer, It was wonderful, smothered in Old Bay Seasoning (which im a huge fan of!) with great cocktail sauce. It was enough for one person to have for lunch.  The next day we ended up going back for a drink and I ended up ordering the fish tacos for a late lunch (*now that's not something i normally order when eating out since you never know what your going to get, for the most part im always disapointed!) but it was really really great!! the slaw was just right, making the tacos not too dry and not fall apart wet,  the fish was good, not overly breaded. wonderful flavor.  I only had a bit of the rice as the tacos were a good size and filling.  Only drank beer but maybe next year will get a margarita:)  thought it was all good for the price and will for sure be back next year.    on a side note, my friends love the nachos and it took 3 of them to eat one order! good bang for your buck if your splitting!  and my other friends had the burger in paradise and they said they were great as well!",

And each time I visit I'm surprised by how large a place this is.  Downstairs is a Keys beachfront bar; upstairs is a Keys house, with even kind of a treehouse vibe.  (Although maybe that's generally the margueritas speaking?  Speaking of which...)  The margueritas are expensive but excellent, and there're a wide variety of them.  The staff is very welcoming and will keep you entertained or leave you alone as much as you'd like.  The food is good, but the attraction here is definitely the atmosphere and the margueritas.  Oh, and of course the music -- live or otherwise, it just feeds the joy around the place.",

Now I did go for lunch on a Saturday vs. try to brave a late-night crowd when there was a performance; all the previous reviews that expressed concerns about food and service were sooo unfounded.  I love the hull-like table I was seated at in the True beach theme...really neat.  Had the beer-steamed shrimp, caesars salad, and cheeseburger in paradise.  All just totally hit the spot (the shrimp because it was unique for Vegas, i.e. not on buffet and steamed with beer and old bay spice...the salad because it was gigantic for a small salad and you tend to forgot the \"good\" food when in Vegas...and the burger, because well, that \"is\" Buffett's and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time).  Beyond that the vibe was very upbeat, Buffett-like for sure.  My server was repeatedly refilling my soft drink and water, was very cordial (I was dining alone and using a Groupon), and the food came out quite prompt.  In general, the vibe of the other employees was great -- ie when folks are smiling, their non-verbal body language reflects that they're having fun...well that means a very positive dining experience for us customers.",

    "text": "During my last vacation in Vegas, Margaritaville was the first stop during our first night out.  We wanted our first night to be more relaxing, so we decided to get some drinks and walk around the strip.  While we were at Margaritaville, we sat in the outdoor bar at the top.  I'm not sure if we would have had as much fun if we were in the main area of the restaurant, since it's pretty loud and full of people.  However, the outdoor bar was really chill with a full bar and bunch of tables.   And just as Benjamin Y. mentioned, the tables are first come first serve. We finally figured that out after a waitress told us to sit anyhwere we wanted.  We were able to get a table at the edge of the bar area , with a great view of Caesar's palace and got to watch the packed outdoor patio of Pure Nightclub.  The great thing about this place is that it's on the strip, but it's not super fancy, so the prices are good. The drinks that I had while we were here were very good, and ranged around $7 for shots, and $8-$10 for cocktails... Definitely a lot better than other places on the strip or in the casinos.  If you're having a casual night out, I would suggest Margaritaville as one of your stops... Save some money and sit around and listen to r&b/hip hop, and of course the live singing... you can laugh at the people who suck at singing... (no offense to those who have sang live there.. but it's entertaining)",

While we were in there, one of them came down a slide into a margarita blender!!   We had a great time. We wanted something relaxed and relatively cheap. Cheap eats are hard to come by in Vegas and this place is a terrific deal for the price. Their portions are HUGE! It's an ideal place to get drunk with a group of friends. Go in early. Even if there are empty tables, they have long waits (we waited for nearly an hour). Also, they don't take reservations on the weekend so you have to be prepared to wait. Just buy one of their tall margaritas and you'll be good to go!",

    "text": "While on my own little Vegas vacation, my family and I passed this awesome little spot on the strip, and I just HAD to check it out.  Being a huge fan of the beverage perfection that is the margarita, I dragged my family in.  There was a small wait during midday Tuesday (about 15 min), but the waiting area was comfortable and air conditioned, and the staff was very friendly overall.  I started off with their \"Perfect Margarita\", which consisted of both gold and silver margaritaville tequila (which I guess was to be expected considering it's Jimmy Buffet's own brand), and it was one of the better restaurant made margaritas that I've had recently.  As an appetizer, the 4 of us split an order of conch fritters (6), which were very tasty.  It would have been very easy to eat the whole appetizer solo, but I'm glad I didn't, because I definitely wanted room for the main course.  My main dish was Jamaican Jerk Shrimp and pasta, which came with a creme sauce that was spicy, but not overbearingly so.  The shrimp were large, and there was a good amount of them, as well.  I couldn't help but finish the whole plate off, the entree was so good I could have licked my plate clean if I wasn't in public.  My sister got the king crab and shrimp salad, and though I only tasted a small portion of it, I was impressed, and would order it the next time.",

It is an experience you can create at home and definitely here at Margaritaville.  The food is fantastic, I love their crab salad.  Margaritas are the best I have ever had when it comes to flavor and consistency (there is one Mexican restaurant I love  that is the best when it comes to size and alcohol content!).  The Raspberry margarita is superb and even if you're just walking by you can get the premade stuff and it doesn't taste like it's made with a mix.    The food is inexpensive and you get to look at awesome scenery.  This is a really great lunch spot in Vegas.",

You would think that a place that charges almost $15 for one drink would have chips and salsa on the table, but no, you have to pay almost $20 for chips, salsa and guac that was not enough to feed the 7 people at our table. I came for the experience and left with no experience, less money in my pocket and I was still hungry. There are definitely way better placed to eat  in Vegas.",

We made our way here and found some chairs at the back of the bar.  I got the zombie which is a great drink and nice and strong.  My friend and I decided to share the chili nachos and I'm so glad we shared because the nachos were huge and between the both of us we couldn't finish them. The nachos could have used more chili but they were good enough to be bar food.  The bartender was very attentive and even entertain us with our silly questions about his background since we couldn't figure out what he was.

Tons of people were waiting to be seated... However, we were patient. We didn't get seated till nearly 10:15am. Breakfast ends at 11am.. We were finally sat down, waited 10mins for the waitress. Took our drinks, waited again. Thought we wouldn't get breakfast by the time she came back. Finally ordered our food.. Didn't get served until 11:10am. The person who brought the food slammed our plates on the table. My food nearly slid off the plate to the table. Didn't get an apology. Two of the other plates had wrong items. We swapped them between ourselves. The waitress never came back till we finished eating. Food was okay, definitely won't come back. Irritating experience all around.  Edit - knocked another star off the review. Our bill wasn't split correctly. Had to have her fix it. We were over charged for our meals. Check the pricing when you order and compare it to your bill later. She dropped off the new bills for us and then came back less than 3mins later asking if we were set to go. Uhm. No. We needed more time. $40 for two below average breakfasts.. No thanks.  Edit - AGAIN, didn't bring me my change back. This place has gone down hill.",

    "text": "Margaritaville is mostly just a touristy bar on the strip serving touristy food; nothing to write home about, but location-wise, it's fantastic.  If people watching is your thing, downstairs bar near the strip entrance is fantastic.  If strip views, head up to the third floor outdoor bar.  Only giving it three stars because of this; it's a try hard two star establishment if it were anywhere but across the street from Caesars.  My recommendation, if you're in a small party, is visit the back bar.  It is way back there and you'll feel like you're in a cave, but the bartenders there are much nicer than the ones up front, and they make better drinks.  Some tips: the BOGO coupons for margs that you get from Flamingo are for their house marg which tastes like lime Gatorade.  Alcohol-wise, and taste-wise, you're better off just buying their \"Perfect Margarita\" even if it does cost double; one of those tastes ten times better and has more alcohol than two regular house margs anyway.  Next, if you get a $5 off $25 retail Margaritaville coupon from Flamingo, there is a very important word in that, and that's the word \"retail\".  It means that if you purchase $25 of tourist junk in their store, you get $5 off, but it is not usable for restaurant bills regardless of them sharing the same name and a restaurant being a retail establishment just like any other business selling goods or services to a consumer.  If group dining is your thing, you'll probably be disappointed there too.  They have an excellent event space on the second floor overlooking the strip, but the catering at private events are a limited menu and insane prices above and beyond their retail prices; oops I just called the food/beverage retail, which they're not in the mind of Margaritaville.  In any case, you'll pay a big premium to hold an event there, so if you're considering Margaritaville for a wedding rehearsal dinner or reception, for example, there are far more cost effective options up and down the strip.",

Delicious, tropical, and everything I hoped it would be. We got to sit in the little \"boat\" section and watch an amazing band playing popular music. They were so entertaining and people were up front dancing along. I was thoroughly pleased with the food, the wait staff, the atmosphere, and the band! I will definitely be back for more.",

The real treat here is the atmosphere.  Just an all around fun place to be with lots of entertainment: whether the on site entertainers, the wait staff or your fellow diners. The key word is fun. In a city where most are working in hospitality to make a buck the staff here seem to enjoy their jobs but honestly you will find that all over vegas. Margaritaville serves a good time with great tasting food and an experience you are unlikely to forget. The best experience is to go with friends but my wife and a I went last night and had a blast. We may just pop in for the volcano nachos!....probably mentioned in other reviews so I won't be Labour the point...but I will let you know if we managed to finish them!",

The catering for the event was pretty good, and the employees were constantly coming around with trays of food and serving drinks.  The atmosphere I thoguht was perfect for a party.  We were up on the 2nd level, with seating on the balcony overlooking the strip.  They have several heat lamps to keep people warm during the colder winter hours.  I am not a drinker, but from what everyone else was saying, the drinks were good too.  I feel like this was the best company party location we have had in the 6 years I have been with my current employer, so hopefully we come back again.",

Not fine dining by any stretch of the means, but you're in Vegas, and it's reasonably priced for standard burgers and bar fare. Claire R. was our friendly server who was very attentive, and personable. We took advantage of sitting at a table which conveniently had an outlet right by so we could be touristy and charge our phones. While we were dining, there was a kitschy performance done by the wait staff where they clapped and sang so that it was like a mini tropical Parrothead production complete with a \"mermaid\" sliding from the top of the bar into a pool of water. Like others have mentioned, you're paying for the fun atmosphere and experience. There is a gift ship and casino attached to the restaurant where you can continue your Margaritaville experience after you finish eating.",

We weren't even in the main floor and couldn't even enjoy the atmosphere of the place. I've been to another margaritaville elsewhere and it was well worth it but not here. Food was bland and not with the price. My \"applewood smoked bacon\" was a thin floppy piece of nothing that tasted like a dog treat. Fish and chips were bland with no flavor. Overall a horrible experience and would not go again.",

Anywho -  I went on Saturday around lunch time and we had about a 15 minute wait. Not bad for the strip. We waited a good 10 minutes after we were seated for our server to come by. She recommended the Bahama Mama, which was awesome! It almost tasted like a 50/50 bar, but it had an interesting kick to it. We settled on the nachos for our entree. It looks huge, but I will say that 70% of the nachos is chips. They were still really tasty, and we had leftovers. We indulged and ordered dessert - the brownie. It's chocolate and ice cream - no point in reviewing that. Of course it was delicious!  Overall, I really liked this place. I hope that I can convince one of my buds to join me soon.",

Once we did get the buzzer, we went to one of the many bars they had and got what else, but a margarita! I had the \"Havanas and Bananas\" and it was SO GOOD.  (Banana and coconut... delicious!)  It made the rest of the wait for the table bearable.  For food, I had the turkey burger that had the pineapple on top, which I also strongly recommend.  Also very delicious.  And the fries here rock too.  Really a great experience, and I would be more inclined to return to another one of these over another tourist chain like PH or Hard Rock.  The gift shop has a lot of cute things as well",

No dancing girl coming out of a volcano, swinging from an anchor and spinning in a margarita glass?  Please tell me this isn't so Courtney G.  I was so sad we missed Margaritaville this trip :(  We normally have the Jamaican me crazy wings, and or nachos, any one of their Cheeseburgers, they ALL make me feel like I'm in paradise and one of those super fun tall Margarita dispensers.  I love it when we go and there aren't any out yet, and then after we order ours they start popping up all over the place.  It's like a cocktail that YOU can make go viral!    Some more fun things that I love about Margaritavile besides the above mentioned is the ever fun \"get the ring on the hook\" game.  We really enjoying sitting in the awesome big chairs to finish up what ever boat drinks didn't go down with our meal and people watching.  I must like making people want what I have, because if we are lucky enough to get in a said chair, we get lots of jealous looks, and they are always occupied immediately after our departure.  I never leave with out getting some new Parrot Head swagger from the super fun store.  Margaritaville isn't just a meal for us, it's an event we look forward to, and Vegas just isn't the same to me with out it.  I wish there was one in Torrance!      Anyway, I'm super impressed that I feel like you are going to take the time to read and respond to my review Courtney G.  That makes me feel just a special as I do when we get to go and have such an awesome time, food, and service at your restaurant.  If the craps tables weren't so mean to me last weekend, I would almost want to go back just so I could get my fix.  Alas...........there is always next time.",

I'll be honest, that was the best thing I had over there. OK my drink was delicious, but it was too expensive!  Alright honestly, I don't know if I want to come back here. It was fun and all.

The house band is loud and pretty cheezy IMHO, but everyone else in the world seems to enjoy 'em.  The bar is always super packed, hence next to impossible to get a drink.  And the prices are pretty hefty for being just a shitty little bar.  Why the upgrade?  Well, on the Tuesday night I went, it was pretty empty.  My friend and I found seats at the bar and had a very friendly bartender who was able to assist us in charging our drinks to my friend's room at Harrah's.  Kind of a cool Harrah's perk, I guess.  Great place for people watching on the patio, too.  If it's my choice, though, I'll pick a different spot to go eat or drink at.",

I love tacos and this is very commercialized kind of tacos...if ur looking for authentic tacos avoid this place. Also ordered corn and crab chowder, they must have tons of salt in the back coz it was freaking salty too!! Had to order chips and salsa coz I didn't want to eat salt for dinner.",

    "text": "Great for breakfast on the Strip!  Not impressed with dinner though.    So to be positive, let me tell you about breakfast.  I LOVE to go to any Margarittaville I come across on my travels, if for nothing else but to have a drink and collect a glass.  If the particular menu looks good, we will eat as well.  I was surprised to find out that the Vegas location is open for breakfast - AWESOME!  We started the day, Vegas-Style with orange juice, sugar free red bull and vodka in a souvenir glass - yeah baby.  If that's isn't the way to start your day then what is? LOL  The food that followed was very good for breakfast food at a chain...I had steel cut oatmeal with fresh veggies.  Hubby had an omelet of some type with wheat toast.  We were pleased and will go back for breakfast  again next time in Vegas.  However, dinner was below average in taste and pricey for \"bar food\".  Too crowded and service was below par.",

Drinks were good and if you want pub food like nachos, burgers and fish tacos for a good price then there's really no better place to go.  With all the inflated prices on the heart of the strip, Margaritville still gives you a pretty good bang for your buck.  You waitress Shaavon was phenomenal....she kept all the bills separate for those who needed to leave early and continued to bring everyone their food and drinks over the span of three hours without missing a beat.  It sent a private party but it mine as well have been...thanks Shaavon and MargRitaville for giving us e VIP treatment while we were there.  See you during our next visit!",

Margarittaville is where you end up when you didn't have a plan, you get washed up in the tide of 'go with the flow' then you hit yourself on the head and say, 'what the HELL?' and leave as fast as you can.",

It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to notice we were even there, and then another 20 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I had also ordered a salad with my meal, and I had to flag him down about 30 minutes after I ordered it to ask where it was.  I mean, it was lettuce and tomatoes--not that serious.

    "text": "A very interesting place on the strip, located next to Flamingo and right across the street from O'sheas. You can either go to the bar, which overlooks Caesar's Palace or the restaurants which is uniquely decorated. Very colorful and scenic surrounding. Kind of a tight squeeze to get around, but its manageable.   The wife and I came here for dinner, after watching a show at O'sheas. Of course the usual wait for dinner, since it was a bit crowded at the time. But it seems to be reasonable time to wait. It is on the crowded part of the strip, so you got people coming and going. But impressed on how things are handled.   The wife and I, mainly had one thing in mind. Is to attempt the Volcano Nachos that was a well known dish for Margaritaville. We wanted to see for ourselves on how massive these nachos are. From the looks of it, we should of invited 3-4 more people to help us finish the nachos. In my opinion, it was really good. Wish I could of finished it, I hate wasting food. The nachos over exceeded our expectations, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Even though the Volcano Nachos was a lot of food, we needed more flavor and we just ordered more. I ordered the shrimp, which was good and had that coconut twist, which made it delicious. I was able to eat all of it, and was able to swipe at the nachos still. But there comes a time where I had to throw in the towel and admit I was full.   Overall, I like the place cause it was fulfilling. I did enjoy the kindness of the staff. Depend on when you go, depends on the wait. Since we did go during dinner time, I usually give the waiters 10 minutes to come around and it seems like they been on top of things that night. The Nachos were good, but I would suggest to order it, if you have a group of people, other than you and one other person.",

We were seated within 5-10 minutes (downstairs where it was hot and muggy, we were told an hour).   We were seated outside on the deck overlooking the Strip.  The weather was perfect and it was SO nice!     The food was good.   Pretty much what you'd expect from a chain type restaurant.   The servings were HUGE, so consider splitting one dish.  Hey, you can always order more if you're still hungry, right?  Great service.   We were moved to a table against the railing when I requested instead of back against the wall, which was super nice of them.  Pirates on stilts were hobbling around making balloon animals for random tables.  They skipped ours.  Boo!  Loved the classic rock they had playing over satellite radio.   Not too loud, so we could still have a conversation without being drowned out.",

They are overpriced and just ok, not anything to get excited about....they don't even use margarita glasses. You're better off going to an authentic mexican place and paying half the price for a better tasting margarita that you can actually enjoy. My boyfriend got the ultimate margarita and it wasn't even drinkable. It was super strong which sounds great because I guess you are drinking $15 worth of liquor but tasted nothing like a margarita and couldn't drink it without making a harsh face after every sip. The margarita I got was ok. I was at least able to drink it. Food is way overpriced. On their website they had these vegetarian tacos that sounded amazing. I look at the menu and they aren't on there. I asked the waiter about it and he said they didn't have them and they just got new menus the day before. $15 for a veggie burger and fries? Come on...and $14 for cheese quesadillas that literally looked and tasted like someone took pieces of cheese and microwaved it between tortillas? I was super excited to try this place but in the end was extremely disappointed.",

I believe I had ordered a Bahama Momma drink which I thought was pretty good but all the other drinks that were ordered lacked alcohol and tasted too much like sugar.

The grown man wearing a tube top and a pirate patch was one of the most amusing things I saw out there.   Anyways, I know I know, get on with it Raymond... I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich which was pretty good for being served at one of the strips many themed restaurants.. The other items brought to our table: Volcano nachos, and a fajita concoction, everything looked great and smelled great and the atmosphere was okay.  It was a little odd when the attractive young lady on stilts walked over to our table and bent down in my face to ask if i wanted an awesome Balloon hat made by the best looking girl on stilts in town.... Uhhhhhh,  \"AWKWARD\".   They try really hard to make the atmosphere  party-esque which they do a pretty good job of. My only complaint is that in the hour and a half that we spent there I think I heard the same songs over and over and over again.  I guess I can say that this is cool to check out once... The food was decent, not the best I've had and the drinks only had a splash of alcohol and were over priced.    I don't see myself going back but feel free to sail away in the back of a fishing boat mounted to a wall while the Benjamins fly out of you wallet..",

You won't feel super stuffed when you try to squeeze into your dresses for the evening! Hehe. :) The pasta was pretty good, you can also substitute the chicken for shrimp too.  Of course, you can't go to Margaritaville without trying out their margaritas! A few of my friends ordered the Tropical Fruit Margaritas (Mango and Guava). They're on the sweeter side, but pretty yummy! Although you'd probably have to drink a couple more to get a decent buzz, haha.  This restaurant has a sort of tiki/Hawaiian sort of atmosphere. In between our meal, the staff put on a little musical number... complete with a dancer sliding into a pool (or giant cup) of water! Even though it is a little cheesy, eating here was entertaining!",

The blended ones give me a brain freeze. I will admit that last time I came here I was a little buzzed and everything tasted good. But overall the margaritas are good.  When it comes to the food I remember sharing a chicken sandwich with my friend. It was enough to be shared. Again, tasted great when you've had hours and hours of drinking. One of the first times I went there I got the nachos and they were HUGE! I'm not kidding -- you can feed a family of 4 easily. They are just to big and lack flavor.  Service was fast and friendly. It does get packed but a little short wait is not all that bad. Music is pretty cool and just a great atmosphere overall. Great place to start the night!!!",

Fries were good enough and the margaritas were a bit weak but tasted good.

They were really good! The sauce was tasty, just a little kick - not really spicy at all. I got the fish sandwich - blackened. I wasn't expecting anything great, but there were two big pieces of fish on my sandwich. It was really good, and the seasoning was delicious. My friend ordered the taco salad, and it looked delicious. She said it was. We were both surprised that we were happy and stuffed before even finishing our meals. I would definitely come here again.",

Yummy sour apple margaritas in a yard-long cup that had a neck strap.  I think it's worth noting that I was pretty WASTED on my first trip.  Every subsequent trip has been spent \"Chasing the Dragon.\"  I just can't get that same feeling anymore.  Super loud and crowded to the point that I can't have a conversation with my own table. Lame music & \"entertainment\"  Service leaves much to be desired...I think everyone appears to be drinking on the job.  Won't be back if I can help it.",

The bartenders were great.  Too great.    I stopped drinking margaritas for a while after that night. Every time I hear that damn Jimmy Buffett song on the radio all I think about are balloon hats, and the rather strong drinks the bartenders made us that night.  It was a lot of fun and the memories (if you can even call them memories) are priceless.    We got to know some locals and probably the only other Christmas vacationing family in Vegas who were at a margarita themed bar just hours before they celebrated baby Jesus' birth.  It was an instant bond.    I'd recommend this place in small doses to young people for the drinks but the food isn't anything special and the music will drive you to drink (and I DO love Jimmy!).  For families be warned that a nearly naked mermaid flies down a watered up slide and into a giant green looking margarita glass while swimming and twirling around to Jimmy Buffett classics.    Oh, Vegas.",

I order the coconut shrimp. It came with 5 pieces of shrimp with a horseradish mango dipping sauce, those were good. My fries were cold and flavorless. My lime/cilantro coleslaw tasted like warm cabbage. No flavor. You could tell it has set out for a while as it was warmer than my fries.  For that price I would highly suggest somewhere else. The cocktails are good, but expensive, the food... I've had better out of a freezer bag, the staff seemed great! The entertainment is a joke. I was embarrassed for them. No one seemed to know a routine nor did they seem to care. This place was great 6 years ago, but definitely has gone down hill. I'm giving it two stars, as our waitress was great, otherwise I would be forced to give it one star as that's the minimum.",

Once for breakfast and once for dinner.  For breakfast: I decided to go for the 'griddle combo', which was basically every breakfast food you can imagine on your plate, for $15...French toast and regular toast...in the same meal!...anyways it was a ton of carbs, my over medium eggs came out over (very) hard.  I don't think I would come back here for breakfast, but it did hit the spot after a few too many drinks the night before.  For dinner: I ended up getting a burger for dinner and a margarita on the rocks.  This was a much better meal than the breakfast one and considering we were sitting on a patio overlooking the heart of main part of the strip very reasonably priced.  The margarita was definitely the highlight.  Looking back I probably should've tried something a little more adventurous than a burger (jerk chicken? Seafood Mac & cheese?).",

The dressing was made by the head chef. Some oil from the salad stained my blouse, but I didn't care. The nachos were piled high and couldn't taste any better. I love picking from the middle where the chis a re somewhat soggy from the cheese. There were many people in my group, and we didn't finish the nachos! I've also had the tortilla soup which tasted good too.  After some good eats, my friends and I hit the dance floor. There is a live band that plays, then after a certain time they play music ranging from oldies to whatever is current. Our waitress had everything in order and we were seated and served very fast. If you're visiting Las Vegas, this is a nice place to visit. It's in a nice location on the strip, so there is no traveling out of the way.",

It's fruity, gives you that island feel and it tastes amazeballs. We split it with a group of friends and it's about 4.5 drinks, give or take. Pretty tasty stuff and I would come back just for that.

They tasted pretty good, but the glasses they were served in were just plain drinking glasses.  Not impressive for the price.  We had the land shark battered cod, fries and coleslaw.  The cod was AMAZING!!!!!!  Although a bit pricey, it was a huge helping of fish. So good!!!!!  The fries were not very good and the coleslaw had cilantro and lime in it, which sounded interesting, but just tasted weird,   All in all, it is worth an occasional visit.",

I love fish tacos and eat them anywhere I go. Thought they would be amazing but the Mexican joint down the street was more flavorful. The best part of the meal was their volcano nachos that we ordered as an app. They were huge and really delicious. They are big enough to order as a meal too, they also cost just as much lol. Great margaritas too.  For being located right on the strip the prices were actually on the cheaper side. To sum it up great atmosphere, prices and alcohol. Food (except for the nachos) could use a bit more flavor.",

While we were there we had the opportunity to see costumed singers and the girl in a bikini take the plunge down the volcano slide into the large margarita glass.  Great place for Jimmy B fans, couples, and singles. More of a place to have a meal and a couple of drinks and head out; not for a long night of hanging out. The outside balcony is a great people watching spot on the strip. Maybe not the best place for the 10-16 age group because of the volcano show.",

I have been to several, including Montego Bay and Ocho Rios (Jamaica), Grand Cayman, Cozumel Mexico ,and Orlando Florida. This was my first visit to Vegas, and visiting the Margaritaville Restaurant was a must.   First of all, I will briefly mention that I LOVED the casino, but will be writing a separate review for that. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.  So as with any of the other Margaritavilles they are pricier than the average restaurant around. Although compared to other places on the strip, this is probably average priced. The food we had was great (burgers) and the drinks were excellent as well (margaritas and beer). The service was great and was definitely worth it for the experience. It is in a good location on the strip (inside of the flamingo) and you exit right across from Caesers palace and bus stops.   When I return to Vegas I will definitely return to this Margaritaville. Outside of the Islands, this is my favorite location. The atmosphere is great, but nothing is better than a Margaritaville with a view of the ocean.",

Margaritaville was located very close to our hotel so we stopped in for a bite (who really wants to walk around in 100 degree heat looking for a place to eat?). We were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress came by soon after.   I ordered a fish sandwich with sweet potato fries - there was so much food I couldn't finish my plate. I didn't even eat the bun (yeah, I was THAT girl. What about it? #carbproblems)  My friend ordered a burger, which she said was really good. My other friend ordered a taco salad, which she could not stop raving about.   The food was great, the service was fast, and...those damn pretzels were stupid good.    I have zero complaints (except that the plate should have more pretzels...).

So a big part of me was still a tourist.  The food is always fine. I love the music that is played. Service is very par for the course.  Three weeks ago the wife and I returned. Afterwards I was thinking of what to say in this review.  All I could think of was Despicable Me and a few quotes from that film.  \"Gru: We stole the Statue of Liberty...! [the minions cheer] Gru: ...the small one, from Las Vegas! [the cheers stop] Gru: I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower... also Vegas.\"  Porter: We went to Margaritaville...! [no minions here so no cheering] Porter: ...the restaurants, from Las Vegas!  Don't get me wrong, Margaritaville is a fine place to go, but extremely touristy.  And I didn't see and fluffy unicorns in the gift shop either.  Maybe we could sell unicorns that have Jimmy Buffet quotes like....  \"Why don't we get drunk...\" \"Searching for my lost shaker of salt.\" \"I don't know where I'm gonna go.\"  (long pause)  \"LIGHT BULB!\"  But I digress, have a great day folks.",

I get that it's Las Vegas and right on the strip, but to me, I didn't think it was worth the money. We got seated right away and waited quite a bit of time each time the wait service came to our table to order, deliver food, bring checks, etc.",

Once we got seated the server quickly served us waters and asked if we wanted our tab split.   As far as drinks go... What better drink to get from margaritaville than a margarita :). Margarita was well worth the $11.95 it was and we also ordered a strawberry lemonade and asked the server if they can add titos vodka which he did for an additional charge. Both drinks were great.   Food wise we were recommended a mahi mahi special which my mom got. She enjoyed it and said was good. My dad ordered the fish tacos which he also enjoyed. My fiance and I ordered the volcano nachos which to me were ok at best. Seemed like they had it on the warmer for a while and didn't look as good as I thought it would. My sister ordered the fish and chips which looked good. Should have got that instead. Maybe next time.   There was a guy walking around making balloon animals for kids and told my nephews he would be back since he ran out of balloons. We waited a few minutes and I think he forgot lol. Sorry kiddos.",

First off it is a cool place that is dressed up like a beachy ocean dock area, with Jimmy Buttett music playing. Better than the atmosphere was our waitress, Randie, I have not had service this good in quite a while.  Since this was my first visit I asked for a few hints on what was good.  She started us with nachos, really good nachos, I mean really good. After this I was pretty much full.  However, she said I needed the Hamburger in paradies.  She was right.  My friend got wings and we spilt.  Wings were cooked perfect nice and crispy. And by the way my iced tea never was empty, that means a lot.  So in the end Margaritaville was really good and service was awsome. Thanks Randie and Margaritaville for a good lunch. 4 stars for food 5 stars for service.",

    "text": "Often times Margaritaville seems to have an older crowd. That doesn't really bother me, and I know that the reason is because of the live music. Kids these days just want DJs. I, however, think younger people would LOVE it. The live music is fun, and it is generally a band doing cover songs, so everyone will know the songs. In between sets they play traditional club music (hip hop or whatever). It is free, which I love, and the drinks are generally pretty strong. They have food and plenty of seating, which is also free to just sit at if you can find an open table. There is plenty of room to dance, and it doesn't seem like anyone is trying to have s*x on the dance floor. The people at Margaritaville are just there to have a good time, which is exactly what we go there to do. I just want to hang with my girls, meet some funny people, and act like fools. Margaritaville makes that happen while still being cool enough for everyone in our group. Don't forget that there are a couple bars as well. So getting a drink is easy, and the decor is fun; very nautical.",

The coconut shrimp dish was not to my liking, but if you come here you should order the nachos, they are super tasty.

    "text": "Wish I could give a review on the food and/or establishment but, unfortunately, we left before we ordered anything. After standing, for a few minutes, by a sign that said \"please wait for host to be seated\" we were barked at from about 15 feet away by a waitress/hostess?? Who immediately made us feel stupid for standing by said sign and pointed to a bunch of hightop tables and said that you just seat yourself. So at this point she walked us to a high top table that was literally feet from both the bathrooms and the kitchen. We are from out of town and we're looking for the \"Margaritaville\" experience which this was not matching. So we asked if we could be moved to a table in the, at most, half filled dining area. With a somewhat disgruntled look on her face the hostess pointed us back to the direction where we were initially waiting and said to go see the host and they would seat us. So after wandering around and finally seeing the host signs and arrows intermingled with the rest of the restaurant decor we found our way to the host which immediately got on her intercom and started asking, I believe, the same lady(?) that we just left, what hightops she had available. At this point I interjected and explained that we wanted to sit in the dining area at a table and not in the seat yourself bar area. I'll admit, at this point, we were fairly frustrated and it continued as 3+ people sat 5 feet away talking to each other confused like this was an unattainable request. So after a minute of this ANOTHER lady guided us towards a booth to which when I approached and saw that the table was permanently attached to the ground there was no way I was going to fit as I am 6'4\" tall and over 300 pounds. So as I expressed this they immediately went back to the intercom communication as my wife and I stood they're embarrassed while other patrons looked at us and the spectacle that was taking place. It was at this point where we politely told them never mind we weren't going to stay for dinner. It was unfortunate. We have eaten at other Margaritaville locations such as CityWalk location at Universal in Orlando and loved the food and the gigantic nachos and the Caribbean style music and atmosphere. Definitely did not have the same experience at this Las Vegas location in the flamingo casino. Needless to say we will not be going back. Two thumbs down!",

    "text": "In common with most Vegas bars, Margaritaville promotes itself as a place to drink, eat, party and hang out and have some fun. What many people don't know, is that it serves a pretty good breakfast, too.   The location is front-of-Strip on 3 floors. If you take the elevator to the 3rd floor, you can sit out on a terrace and enjoy views of the Strip, and across to Caesar's Palace and The Forum. There's not a slot machine in sight, and you will be attended by solicitous staff who are keen to ensure you are going to have a nice day.   It serves staples such as Eggs Benedict, Bacon & Hash Browns, and even offers the 'Boatmeal' - a healthy option (rare in the USA) of oats with fresh raspberries and strawberries. Wash it all down with a bottomless cup of coffee. Reckon on $10 p.h.   And the Margarita bit? They specialise in giant Margaritas of all types, with 100's of different tequilas on offer. But it was a bit soon after breakfast, when one has work to do",

Inside there is a nice bar area with a list of many different margaritas, hence... never mind you should already know.  Anyway... the inside decor is unique; with fishing boats that you can eat in, fishing poles, big plastic fish and what not.  There was also a stage, but there wasn't anything going on that night.

Atmosphere here and layout of the restaurant is interesting in a good way. Visited with 3 friends and sat out on the patio for lunch on a weekday. It was a chilly day, so the heaters on the patio would have come in handy, but the one near us did not appear to be working. On to the menu...  After looking at the menu, I had some questions for the server. They were honest about the food, which I always really appreciate. The honesty included this- don't get the fish tacos, they are bad. I don't remember if that's an exact quote, but close enough. I ended up ordering the Caribbean chicken salad, which was fresh and exactly what I was looking for. Definitely a meal sized salad, so if you don't like left overs you may want to ask for a half-portion. I believe my friends ordered burgers and were happy with their choices overall.   This place is the definition of A-OK. Standard food, fast service, and a convenient location.",

Who would have thought that the WORST margaritas on the strip that we had, would be from a place named after them?  My wife brought back 3 drinks for a few of us, 2 \"Uptown Top Shelf\" margaritas, and one watermelon margarita, all on the rocks.  They were so sweet and \"syrup-y\" that it was hard to drink (and I couldn't drink more than a few sips of mine)... there was no apparent alcohol even in the drinks, nor was any effect of tequila or alcohol noticed from even my wife after finishing hers (and she's a light weight!).  Had it not been the fact is was a 5-minute walk back to where we were gaming, we would have returned them.  Hard to believe this place has such terrible margaritas!!!  If you want a great fast margarita, I would highly recommend La Salsa Cantina on the strip!  Lightyears better in both taste and alcohol content.",

There are three pirates on stilts who go around making balloon animals, hats, etc.  Every hour at the top of the hour, they play Buffett's Volcano and Margaritaville and the stilted pirates gather.  Then a girl climbs a ladder above the bar and goes into a volcano and comes out in a bikini.  She comes down a slide and lands in some water and does some Cirque du Soleil moves.  Then she dances for a bit.  I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, minus the green beans (so they gave me extra mashed potatoes, though I didn't eat them all).  Real chicken rather than processed ... yay!  Though it was good, I found it all a bit too salty.  Maria was my server and she took good care of me.  There was a band coming on about 11 but I was too tired to hang around for them.   There is a gift shop and casino right next door.",

I was only disappointed that the brownie sundae on the gluten-free menu is no longer available--we were really looking forward to it. We got the volcano nachos to share (must be a shared item because it is HUGE). I was disappointed that there is a bit a gluten-free kids menu, I was going to ask for the Jr cheeseburger sans buns and pick apples or carrots for the side, but we decided to share instead (she's 7). We maybe ate half of the volcano, but I'm satisfied. The nachos were $15.99 and i know would have spent a lot more for less food elsewhere. I got the blended Who's to Blame margarita. $9.75 Not the place is done at regularly, but on vacation with few other gluten-free choices, absolutely.",

We waited for about 15 mins, that was ok pretty standard in Vegas to wait.  We sat at our table for probably 10 mins before our server came over to even get us started with drinks. When he did come over we were ready to order, we ordered drinks and our breakfast my husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the key west omelette.  The coffee came pretty quick so did the food, however the omelette was awful it was cold and the shrimp was rubber, it had a really rich cheese in the middle that was not even throughout the omelette. The chicken and waffles were not much better the outside of the chicken was really greasy but the chicken was dry on the inside. The fruit that came with it was not fresh.   Don't waste your money on this one. Vegas is full of great restaurants, this isn't one. We won't be going back.",

Went here on Cinco de Mayo because we had to have margaritas and we were able to score a seat on the upper deck, which I thought was nice until they told us they couldn't put up the umbrellas due to wind so that we baked in the unrelenting Vegas sun.  Ordered overpriced margaritas in tiny plastic cups filled with ice as well as a shrimp appetizer that came with exactly 5 1/2 shrimp.  For my entree, I ordered the shrimp trio which was about Red Lobster quality at twice the price ($25).  I did like the spicy sauce with the coconut shrimp, though.    Service from the waitress was nice but they have a line to stand in if you want a table upstairs, only it's not marked and the lady who was seating people wouldn't tell people where to go, so people would come upstairs and then stand at the front of the line in front of people who had been waiting 20 minutes.  It was comical to watch.  I'm not the target demographic for this joint so take my review with a shaker of salt.  I equate Jimmy Buffet to the Ethan Hawke character in the film \"Reality Bites\" and regard each with disdain, so that may color my opinion.",

We were in Vegas to celebrate 2 birthday the weekend of March 8th-10th. We waited about 15-20 minutes to get seated. Once seated we were greeted by Randy who was our server & he wasn't a very good one. The lack of communication with everyone at the table was very minimal & so was the interaction. He never asked if we had been to Margaritaville. When he asked what we wanted to drink, we all ordered we said thank you & we got no response. We didn't think much of it & then when it came down to ordering our food, Randy didn't ask if we had any questions or if we wanted any ranch, hot sauce, etc. No recommendations, no nothing. We later see him at a nearby table engaging more with that table. He even grabbed the gentleman's shoulder and laughed with them & insisted for them to get another bucket of beer. He catered to them more than our table. Not one time did Randy come over before our food was out to see if we wanted to order a margarita or if we needed a refill. He judged us upon knowing the type of people we were. He took a while to come by and pick up the guac & chips plate that sat at our table for 20 minutes. We all work in the food industry and for someone to treat us a certain way sucks. Not sure if he later realized he was being rude and not as helpful as he should of been but by that time it was too late. Everyone at my table was so ready to close out their tab and go .. I will never stop at Margaritaville when in Las Vegas, the worst experience ever ! Hope Randy realizes what he did wrong & enjoyed his shitty tip!",

    "text": "Cinco De Mayo!  We got here for an early lunch, the bar area was already full so we opted to sit in the restaurant.  We lucked out and ended up sitting in the boat for the first time.  Even though they had Margarita specials I ended up buying the perfect margarita for $12.50 I believe. For meals, I had the BBQ burger and my wife had the JIMMY S JAMMIN  JAMBALAYA which was about $20.00.    The BBQ burger was cooked just like I asked -well done and the apple wood bacon was unbelievable! That made the burger well worth it. The fries were crunchy just how we like them!  My wife never had Jambalaya, I think she counted 4-5 shrimps and liked the sausage. It was just enough spice for her.   The margarita itself was very very strong. I only had one and it set me straight for a few hours or should I say crooked :) Margaritaville is truly one of our favorite spots for margaritas!!  We will be back soon for my Bday :)",

    "text": "Being a Vegas local, I only come to the strip when visors are in town. We went to the bar and sat at table even though we were only here to grab drinks. After we were sat, a strange man on stilts dresses as a pirate touched my head with a ballon sword. Ok. Mind you we are all grown ass adults so why he decided to come up to us is beyond me. That being said, I don't think it it appropriate for him to be touching strangers. Then he proceeded to come back even though we were not interested in speaking with him nor a ballon animal. Besides their weird stilt men, we ordered drinks which were very disappointing. Two of us ordered the perfect margarita. Which was in fact very far from perfect. Very strong and barely tasting like it was mixed properly by the bar tender. Needless to say after our one drink each. We left. Also, service was terrible. Our server, Eric, was MIA most of the time, either watching the hockey game or talking to his other tables. Not once did he check up on us after we got our drinks. We waited probably over 20 minutes to get a check. Even though I was standing a ready to go, not even one other employee came up to see if everything was ok.",

    "text": "After years of visiting this place, I still only come for one thing...Five O'Clock Somewhere cocktails. This was the very first drink I purchased in Vegas when I became legal to drink and I've been ordering it ever since. I stop in for one whenever I'm in Vegas or at least try to. I enjoy the flavor despite it somewhat having the flavor of grapefruit. The cocktail also has a good amount of rum for Bacardi 151 fans.  I don't order much food here but if I were to call off any from the top of my head that I believe is worth ordering, it would be the seafood mac n cheese (formally lobster mac) and would have been the teriyaki steak that's no longer on the menu. I use to enjoy the steak that had the flavor of pineapple and do enjoy the mac n cheese that has a creamy cheese and crab flavor. All other entrees I've tried has been just ok, nothing to write home about.   I've visited when it's been sort of dead and other's when it's completely live. The dead times were usually on random week day's when the Vegas strip isn't busy. Nevertheless, there's always good music playing and it's always fun to watch people get up and dance. Especially when they've had one too many drinks.  Five O'Clock Somewhere is my go to here and I'm happy it can still pack a punch year after year since my first time having it eleven years ago.

The food was absolutely delicious and pretty moderately priced considering how expensive things are on the strip in Las Vegas. There was really good prices for cocktails during happy hour and you even got a souvenir cup with a full-size margarita for less than $20. Service was amazing and the interior was very exciting and there was even a real plane in there. 100% recommend and would definitely return again",

She told us it would be about a 15 minute wait, and handed out a pager. No greeting, no smile, nothing. This hostess never cracked a smile for any of the customers walking up to her. After about 20 minutes of waiting, a dark haired male employee walked behind the hostess desk, and NOW she smiled. We watched about 15 minutes of flirting, touching, and smiling between THESE TWO EMPLOYEES, while a couple of customers were ignored, and walked out. After a half an hour of waiting, our pager went off, and we walked into the restaurant. Now, an older dark haired female with a puss, led us to our table. Again, no greeting or smile. Our server, a female with light brown hair, arrived, and AGAIN, no smile or greeting, until we said hello. After giving our order, our food arrived about 15 minutes later. FINALLY, the young man, dark hair and beard, who brought our food, said hello, and SMILED. Besides him, the tall young man taking pictures, smiled also. Our food, Eggs Benedict, was good, but lukewarm. After eating, our server, who didn't refill our coffee until she was flagged down, took our money, with no \"how was everything\", or anything! No \"thank you\", only a \"you're welcome\", when my husband thanked her for handing him the bill!  As we walked out, both the original blonde hostess, and the dark haired woman who seated us, we're behind the front desk chatting with each other. No goodbye, thank you, or anything!  We won't be back again, even though we're locals. With all of the eating establishments in Vegas, Jimmy Buffet had better watch out! With these kind of employees, he'll be losing business!!!",

The bartender doesn't know how to make a michelada, so don't ask and don't bother trying to explain how to make it.  We went on the morning after the Jimmy Buffett concert, and even under such special circumstances, it was sad and lackluster.

    "text": "It's based on the chain. However I would have to say others that I have been to within the chain have been better. I ordered the trio platter with tacos, artichoke dip, chips and chicken tenders. I have to say it was pretty bland. The platter was 19.00. The drinks are watered down and have little alcohol in them. We went during the day on a Sunday so it was not overall packed. It's Vegas so there will always be a line for the restroom. The waiter was nice and overall service was good. But overall, it just did not hit the spot. It's convenient on the north end of the strip by flamingo, so that definitely brings in the business. If you are looking for something great, this just won't do it. If you are just looking for something to fill your stomach, well then this would at least do the trick.   There is a lady that walks around taking pictures,  beware, they say it's free and will give you a small one, but of course they will show you big options with frames to try to get you to buy.",

Yes it's a chain, yes it's super corny and yes the prices are expensive, but it's the Strip and everything is going to be overpriced and corny.   This most recent time I came I had the Taco Salad without the ground beef to make it vegetarian friendly. It was a pretty basic salad, but overall still tasty and a large portion. I always recommend people to get the volcano nachos. They're super good & more than enough for 3-4 people to share. The rest of the food I was say is hit or miss, definitely not anything over extravagant, but it is a chain restaurant after all.   If you're touristing around and want a nice bite to eat along with a mermaid show, check this place out. You can also get a margarita tower too... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right?",

I must say the photographer at Margaritaville took one of our best we've had taken. Anytime we go on the High Roller for example the picture is horrible. It will cost you between $10 and $30 for the picture, which is not put on the bill.  Of course the free souvenir picture is acceptable except the pictures so tiny.",

Volcano nachos, blender margaritas(yaaaaaas, a whole pitcher to your greedy self), small strawberry margarita and plates of bison burgers. I'm in heaven. With cellphone in hand and friends to talk to, the wait hadn't seemed that bad. We were seated in a fishing boat booth, and though kind of stuffy at first, grew onto you. Specials had $5 shots with $7 margueritas. Loveeeeely.  Our plate of nachos arrived and it was a steaming pile of orgasmic carbs. Serving size was good for 5 people, if not more, and we scraped every last remaining piece of cheese. So worth the calories. What I enjoyed the most wasn't just the cool shows happening every 30 minutes, or the crazy people in stilts walking around making balloon animals, it was that their margueritas were so well blended you tasted how strong the alcohols were, but didn't choke on them. Amen!  Our server was an absolute doll, and we loved her. Customer service gets an A+ from me! Was such a tourist kinda night, but we loved it. I wouldn't choose to come on a non-occasion type of night, but it's a nice treat.  Pictures were taken, balloon hat was made, check paid and tip dropped--off we went.",

Joshua was our server -- he told us that he is usually a busboy but injured his back so he was waiting tables.  It showed because his service was not good -- wasn't there anything else that they could find for him to do?  Anyway, we started with the peel & eat shrimp -- great in concept, awful in reality.  The menu stated that they were seasoned with old bay, which is fine, but it was as if someone opened an entire bottle of the seasoning on the shrimp.  To say it was overpowering was an understatement.  You couldn't even see the shrimp because of the seasoning.  We had the fish and chips and cheeseburger.  The fish had no flavor at all.  I will say that the strawberry margarita was good as it should be given the restaurant name.  An interesting tidbit was that we asked Joshua if Jimmy Buffet ever stops in the restaurant -- not that he doesn't have better things to do lol, but just to check it out when the restaurant is closed and thank the staff etc.  He told me that customers always ask and in the 6 years he's worked at Margaritaville Jimmy has never stopped in there.  Whoever is running this place needs to up their game with the food quality.  Yes the decor is fun and yes I enjoyed the videos/music that they were playing on loop, but you need more than that given the competition on the Strip.",

Kudos to Chef David. I hope his supervisor sees this post and tells him keep up good work. I too use to be in the food and beverage industry.

The bourban salmon was disgusting, rice was cold. My dads meal was pretty good. He ordered mahi mahi.  I thought the prices are overpriced for the quality of the food. And the menu doesnt have a large variety of food. Wont be back.",

There was a live band and in between sets they played the latest hits. They have fun drinks and a variety of beer to choose from. I also noticed the food selection and wished we'd dined here instead. Will definitely revisit to try out the restaurant.",

As big as they are, the staff does a decent job of making sure that there's enough of the \"good stuff\" so that you aren't left with just a ton of empty sad chips. Make sure to get an extra side of salsa, there's never enough salsa! Everything else that I have ever gotten here is alright, but the nachos are just wonderful.   The drinks are strong and delicious. Definitely worth the price.   The atmosphere is great. So much fun to be had. Unless you really really don't like Jimmy Buffett music.  The wait can be incredibly long for a table though. If you are just looking to grab a drink, they have a counter by the front door.",

We were staying at the Flamingo, so Margaritaville sounded like the best plan. Turns out we picked right! Well, minus the loud and not very good cover band - equipped with people dancing awkwardly. Because we came in so late, we didn't have the experience of the long lines and just sat ourselves down immediately.   Our server ran over and explained the kitchen was closing soon and let us throw in an order of volcano nachos quickly. The two lightweights of the group opted for frozen margaritas, the other two of us who can handle our liquor went for margaritas on the rocks. They were a little pricey at $8, but nothing outrageous (especially for a big-time tourist spot like this place). The volcano nachos are enormous and delicious. Good place to knock back a drink and eating some seriously huge and greasy bar food. I like this place and would go back next time I'm in Sin City.",

They can make you a margarita however you like, but if you want the good stuff i would recommend the Perfect Margarita. It is as strong as strong can be! Want kick it down a notch? Try the Pink Cadillac. That is a little tastier. If you are not a margarita person they got a good Bahama Mama and Tropical Hurricane. Those are my personal favorites everywhere I go. Prices here are a little high but alcohol content makes up for it.  Food here isn't all that great. I would only suggest getting the nachos. You get a mountain of food that can feed up to 4 people. Add that with your drinks and you are done for the day stomach wise and wallet wise.",

One of those places you go when you fly in and don't get into your hotel until after midnight and don't know your way around the Strip.  We stayed on the strip at Bally's and this place was in the Flamingo.  I'm not a Buffet fan,m so it didn't have my appeal but my lady said they had good margaritas and they did.  WE both had burgers and gotta say, pretty good.  This place was pretty loud and raucous, felt kinda like being at a frat party down south in Tennessee with a cover band cranking out today's biggest hits.  Our tab came to about 52 bucks for two burgers and two drinks total.  The service was surprisingly good for being as loud and crowed and crazy as it was.",

I venture to guess I gained about 5 pounds alone just drinking the Wildberry Coladas. They were perfect. Decent selection of beer and they also serve 48oz Margaritas in a cup that looks like a blender. I hear they're $40, so I passed.   They have a nice little area to stand just outside of the bar and watch people pass by on the Strip below. I enjoyed doing that with a Wildberry Colada or two. Or three. I can't remember.  The food is good bar food. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was good. I had the fish tacos which come served with rice pilaf, cheese, guacamole, salsa and shredded lettuce. I think they fit well with the theme of the place. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he had with onion rings which were the size of frisbees. Almost.   We'll definitely go back for the drinks. With so many amazing choices of food on the Strip, we may not go back for a meal, but we'll definitely go back for some booze in the blender.",

Apparently someone had \"bought-out\" the first two floors leaving only the roof-top bar available.  The line for the roof-top bar started at the top of the stairs and proceed down a hall toward what appeared to be a bus area/kitchen. The stench of stewing garbage in the hallway was over powering. About 20-30 people waited in this line. After 15 minutes, the line didn't move and the same two guys at the front were still there.  We left. Probably never coming back. Management needed to be doing some damage control and wasn't. It probably would have been tolerable if someone tried to get a couple of drink orders for the line.",

Since my drinking days are over, can't comment on that, but the food and the service, and the FUN! are exception.  Great videos, great volcano show, not to mention the decor (some may not like it), but I really enjoy the sportfishing 'boat' as well as Jimmy's giant amphib flying over the restaurant.

In the meantime, the manager came over and was incredibly friendly and accommodating. He asked how he could help, what my allergies were, if I wanted a special menu, if I had benedryl just in case something went wrong etc. It turned out that a food I thought would be safe had an allergen in it, which I would not have figured out had they not been so diligent. Rey (waiter) and Rob (manager) were back and forth 2-3 times each to make sure I made a safe order and that it was tasty. I was amazed and so impressed! I really felt like they truly cared about my safety and that I enjoyed my meal and experience. I have never had a restaurant be so helpful and accommodating. They really made me smile!

    "text": "A group of us were planning to meet up at Margaritaville to drink Margarita's and eat dinner. By the time my group got there the others had gone bar hoping. After being tired from walking the convention center and not eating this was to be the meal of the day. The waiter was very attentive and nice and was from Stockton if memory serves. He told me that the ribs could be dry and not all the people like them but I was hungy so I ordered them.  The problem I thought was the ribs were not dry but they were salty like the french frys which must of been to make people drink more.  The sauce was interesting but I have had better.Overall the food was so-so but the prices were a little pricy. I spend about 22.00 for the ribs. The only thing that was cool was that on the hour a woman jumps into a large margarita glass and the song of Margaritaville Plays it could be cool if your drunk. When I left I did order a margarita to go and thought it was just as good as the one I get from Paris Hotel  in the Effiel Tower glass and for the same amount.",

Although there really wasn't any line, the 4 bartenders were more interested in talking to each other and restocking the bar then taking drink orders. The drinks were reasonably priced and tasted good. We didn't have to wait to get a table thankfully but we did get the very last one. The dance floor had a decent amount of people out on it. I think tacky is too strong a word to describe them but let's just say they were very casually dressed and touristy. It's also the only club I saw in vegas the whole time I was down there where most of the men were sagging their pants and showing off their drawers. We left after the first drink and shot to find something better.",

Well, let's just say it wasn't my choice :)  We also had some timing issues, as we were about to go to a show.        Busy Tuesday night, but we got right in, probably because we didn't care where we sat, which was a good thing, because we were given a table with little to no view of the \"show\".  But that's what legs are for...standing up and moving to where you CAN see the show.  (something I did, but Husband didn't, which was his loss as it was cute entertainment that involved a gal in a bikini, water, splashing and guys on stilts)      We were definitely away from the balloon hat guy also.  And away from quick service and drink refills, but not too bad.      Not starving, we decided to share a Caesar Salad and the Triple Decker Club.  (Husband was in need of something pretty plain).   And that's what we got.  Plain.  The salad tasted like one of those plastic bag \"kits\" you can buy at the grocery store.   The sandwich was decent.",

Especially when Ariel just walked on by!!  They did catch a pirate in the gift shop on they way out but he had a bad attitude.

This time we were at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas waiting to see an 8:00 show. Everybody was hungry and thirsty and our alternative was the Food Court.  We started off with drinks. While a margarita would have was the natural choice, I lighted on the specialty cocktails. Most were rum-based with fruit juices. I had my party face on so I went for the \"It's Five O'clock Somewhere\" cocktail. One aspect of the sweet party drinks is they go down easily. If you don't pace yourself, you'll find yourself face down again in Margaritaville.  Fortunately dinner came before that could happen!  I had the salmon with bourbon sauce. It came with rice and a generous amount of green beans. This was a good meal. The salmon was a bit dry as they left it cooking to get the bourbon sauce to caramelize but they offset it by including a nice amount of tartare sauce. The combination worked perfectly.  By now I was both sated and buzzed. At this point, the floor show started. The show consisted of two people sort of dancing with stilts. It was cheesy but fun. We lustily sang along with the chorus then had a piece of key lime pie. Everyone left with a big grin.",

One time i went there a week before my birthday and one of the bartenders congratulated me for my almost birthday lol. The only thing that id like them to change is the fact that the music they always lay is too quiet, id like them to turn the volume a little but overall its awesome and i cant wait to go back!",

I've been to a few different Margaritaville locations, and this one is definitely the coolest (but also the most expensive).  We got the nachos to start, and they were MASSIVE. Between, the 4 of us, we could only eat about half. I got the beach tacos for my entree, and they were good - a nice light lunch option. My favorite part about this place is the drinks. I got the last mango in paris, and it was delicious.  I would definitely stop here if you're going to be in Vegas - it's an experience!",

One chick had the Wedge Louie Salad.. she wasnt that impressed. The iceberg didn't look that great. Another had chicken wings, they were a hit. Service was friendly and considering the crowd, speedy enough. The deco is fun and makes you want to go to Florida. The Margaritaville casino is 'cute' but wasn't very busy.

Pros:      *limited menu selection, and as such specialized and uncomplicated. Ordered a burger of sufficient size for a reasonable price.        * Decent mixed drink selection. Mostly margaritas, obviously, but literally half the menu are their drinks.        * good service. It was busy, but my server treated me, despite being alone, as well as the parties surrounding me. No complaints there.        * live music. I just have a thing for live music and the soul that comes with it. I imagine it's not like that midday though.   Cons:         *Smaller bar areas and somewhat limited seating it seemed. As I left I noted it was about become difficult to find a table much less a server. The space is great inversely, but it must be a nightmare when the strip is full of pedestrians.     Overall, not a bad joint. Fun and reasonably affordable for what they offer. If you don't like noise, I'd probably go for lunch instead of during nighttime. Don't expect immediate service at all if its busy, but that's just logical. The atmosphere strives to be a pub but one square yard more for the dance floor and it'd be a club. Great for casual drinkers and fulfilling appetizers and burgers.",

When I ordered my food, I told her that my 5 friends and I wanted to share nachos as an appetizer and then I proceeded to order dinner meal and she told me what I got was probably not best because \"I'd be eating too much\". After dinner we asked for our check to be split (she never asked if the checks were separate) and told us in the future tell them first because it's a huge hassle to split a check. She told us she wouldn't split the check since we didn't tell her in the beginning...Nothing should be known as an issue to a guest at a restaurant--coming from someone who works in a 5 star steakhouse.

Flagged down another waiter to help us and essentially got the \"this isn't my station\" response, but he did tell our server. Finally food came at 7:05. When he dropped off our food, we asked for the check, too.  The food was just plain bad and overpriced. My crabcake gooey in the middle. I didn't finish it. The quesadilla was luke warm and the salsa was more ketchup-y than salsa-y. However, it must be said, which is why I'm not giving only 1 star, that my margarita was far and away the BEST margarita I've ever had. I will never ever eat there again, but for sure I will be going back for a drink.  Bottom line...skip all of the food and just get the drinks.",

I had a fish sandwich and fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed it.   2. The show that they put on is SO damn hokey that I stared in open-mouthed horror/amazement. It's a good place to take kids; however, it's not my cup of tea. Mostly I felt terrible for the performers who had to put on the show every hour.  The show involves performers on stilts, costumes, singing along, clapping, and a water slide.  And topped off with balloon sculpting (if that's what it's called) hats for select patrons.   3. We had a friendly server who was patient with dealing with a large group (9 people) for dinner. She did well except for some issues splitting up the bill.   4. The food and drink prices are pretty high and I'll assume part of that is due to the fact that it's Vegas and most of the food/drink there is costly (in my humble opinion). I thought it was overpriced, but it's Vegas so I'm not surprised or complaining.   5.  One member of our party had a rare (medium rare, maybe?) cheeseburger and was the unlucky recipient of food poisoning a few hours after we left. There was no doubt that was what it was from. It was not from another restaurant, nor was it the flu. Based on that alone, I have to go with one star.",

A chap Marty explained to us on arrival that the tables were full, and to go over round the  bar to wait, where we could drink and wait to be seated.  This left me somewhat confused as Marry never quite explained how we would be seated. Eg. Take a number.  So we went round to the bar and could see the restaurant was half full from there. Marty had misled us. So back we came to have a word. Marty had left his post and was on a break (after working hard no doubt), and the new maitrede immediately gave us a seat.  I asked where Marty was and the answer was he was on a break.   Despite Marty, the food was good and we enjoyed our food. The beef burritos and coconut shrimp. Sadly the poor service darkened the experience.  My thanks to Marty that we will never be back.",

There was a cover band playing for about 5 minutes when we sat down for dinner. Because of that, it added another 10% \"entertainment\" tax to my bill, on top of the regular sales tax. I asked my server that if we had waited 5 minutes, would we still have been charged. She laughed, and shook her head.  Right on. Would have been nice to know that before we sat down. To add insult to injury, they didn't even play any Buffett while we were there.   If your coming to Margaritaville to break your Buffett cherry for the first time, skip the Las Vegas destination.",

I got the California Chicken Sandwich which was alright, but their fries were the best part-vvveeryyy yummy.  Good place for kids/big parties. Honestly the best part about it was the video playing on the overhead projector of drunk people making fools out of themselves on tape....very entertaining;)",

The waitress, Jeana, was rude and when we set up the reservation for the group the neglected to tell us they could only split it four ways. We needed about eight separate checks so it was a bit of a pain for everyone to figure out who to give money to and share a check with.",

The music and atmosphere is terrific but the customer service at this place is not good. It took a little over 20 minutes for our appetizer. And our waitress ignored us. She never offered us more drinks or anything. Their prices are pretty high...which shouldn't be a shock because it's the strip but there are better quality places for your money. I've always been interested in going to this place but my first impression was no good.",

I was recently stationed there for a private party, which had it's own place on the very cold deck and a private bartender.  So bad and good things going for it.    I would say the food is ok and the drinks are ok, but you can find much better throughout Vegas.",

    "text": "Not only is the staff in this place completely disorganized, and unprofessional but the food is mediocre at best and overpriced.   I asked for water 3 times, and didn't receive it until I was almost done eating. People around us who sat down way after we did received their food first, and it seemed our waitress was more concerned with talking and chatting up other tables than getting us our food while it was hot, or actually serving us. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, and not only did the pickle look wilted from sitting out too long, the chicken inside the sandwich looked like a piece of driftwood that had been picked through by termites, and the fries were hard, chalky on the inside and cold. We ordered the taco salad, the salad itself was also wilted and soggy, and the presentation was horrendous. The meat piled on top of the salad looked like something my dog leaves in the backyard. Our other friends ordered the nachos, and found the nachos were stale. I don't think a single person at our table was satisfied with their food. When it came time to separate the checks, the waitress handed us a single bill and told us to write our names next to what we ordered. Can you say lazy? Once we did that, I handed her our cards and cash and she disappeared for half an hour.   I wouldn't recommend this place for food or drinks. There are plenty of other places on the strip with amazing food. This place isn't worth the hype or the money.  **The manager of the store has reached out to me since posting this review and assured me this was an isolated incident, and is very embarrassed by our experience and service. The apology and concern felt very genuine, and I look forward to trying this place again with a better result.",

Con: Some so-so dishes, weird hours during the day, \"I want to sit up there!\", slight pricy due to location.  Came here during CES since someone in our group kept mentioning about the legendary nachos and fried calamari. I have to say the nachos lived up the story, but unfortunately the calamari was no longer available.   Our party ordered burgers, pastas, and salads, but it was the volcano size nachos that really did the trick.   Would highly recommend this place.",

Then we were overcharged for dinner and when I asked for the one manager we have meet before the waitress sent us the BOSS lady.  She was also very rude and acted like we had no business asking questions. I hope they don't treat everyone this way because when the tourist slow down its the locals that will keep their doors open.  Unfortunately this local couple will not be ones to help with that.",

We waited about 15 minutes for a seat on their third-story patio on a warm sunny day. As we had just visited Fat Tuesday in the Forum Shoppes, that 15 minutes went by nice and quickly. Once we were seated, I decided that double-fisting wasn't a bad idea and ordered the Woman On Top (their version of a skinny margarita). But wait! The server came back and said they were out of the low-cal ingredients for the drink, so I sadly ordered a normal margarita. Maybe it's standard policy, maybe it was a mistake, or maybe it was the pathetic look on face... not sure what caused my good fortune, but when the bill came... no margarita to be found! Thanks, unknown server!A party of four of us couldn't even finish the nachos that came about 15 minutes after ordering. Had we all been a bit more tipsy, I'm sure we might have finished... but even that's debatable. Trust me, four large hungry guys would be perfectly satisfied with these. It's not the fancy-uppity-atmospheric Vegas that most people flock to the Strip for... but for a midday stop for your aching feet, a snack in your belly and a drink in your tank, I would definitely consider Margaritaville.",
