We then ordered appetizers and they were expensive and TINY.  I know that appetizers can be small, but they were smaller than I have ever seen.  The server was not attentive, never checked in on us.  We constantly had to ask the bus boy to get him.  The sliders were 2 tiny burgers and were tasty,  the ahi tacos were the size of those deep friend mini tacos from the frozen section at the store.  They were just ok.  The Ceviche was good also.  The guy who filled the water glasses was fantastic.  We drank a lot of water since we had to wait so long for drinks.",

The bread that they serve with the hummus was fantastic, it was warmed and oiled lightly. The hummus had roasted chickpeas mixed in, grilled lemon, and was spot on. The potions were good sized and we ended up having enough that we didn't need any dinner later. The cocktails can get very pricy here (15++) but again they had some great craft cocktails for $9 during happy hour so split some appetizers and take advantage of the deals. Love this place!",

The best way to describe the food here is that is something that you will recognize. It's not like some of the other Las Vegas restaurants where you have no idea what the dish consists of. We just ordered a bunch of different plates and shared. The Calamari steak was great! Sweet and tangy and cooked just right! We ordered the Chef's salad and the field greens and pear salad. Very simple salads, with the right flavor. The entrees were the NY Strip, scallops and scampi. The Scampi stood out because it was large, grilled prawns on a bed of squash spaghetti. Never had squash spaghetti before and that was pretty good! Light and overwhelming but a very pleasant flavor. Scallops were awesome! Not much more to say. The NY strip was cooked just right and came with a red wine sauce. All in all a great set of entrees. Desert was warm cookies and cold milk! An old classic but still delicious! The deconstructed key lime pie was my highlight of the night. Didn't expect much from it but it was an amazing flavor (Does come with coconut)!  Mark was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. He even recommended some drinks that had the same alcohol so that our group wasn't mixing! That's attention to detail!",

The steak tartare was creative and tasty. I had the bone marrow the second night and it was amazing!  Perfectly cooked and the sweetness balanced the slight bitterness of the crispy Brussels sprouts.

I wasn't a fan of the bone marrow or pigs ears (though the guy sitting to my left was). The caprese was ok (my wife really liked it, though). The bread part of the caprese was burnt and too hard in my opinion.   If all we'd gotten were appetizers and it hadn't taken 30 minutes to get them, it would be a four-star review.   However, and just speaking for my main course, it was nasty. The waiter did a good job selling me on the special--a portion of the 75 lb. pig they'd just roasted. They brought me a pile of pork, yes, but it was cold and very grisly. I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces. Very disappointing.   The atmosphere was also very loud, and although the waiter knows the menu well, he spoke too fast and in a rote fashion--clearly a result of having repeated the same thing too many times, so between that and the loud background (music in addition to other people), we had to ask him to repeat himself several times.   I guess when you spend over $800 on a meal, you expect the food and service to be excellent.",

This time I had the Bone Marrow and it was excellent. The table tried the salmon and skirt steak which looked good. I felt like a salad and asked them to finely chop and toss the Cobb salad and it was also very good.   All in all a good place with friendly staff.",

Our server Chris (wonderful server) recommended the PB and J old fashioned... I don't even typically order them and this cocktail was so delicious and different. (Pictured below garnished with a pb and j sandwich).  Boyfriend order drunken skirt steak- cooked perfectly, tasted delicious (he only let me have a bite :) ). Tender, full of flavor and so juicy!   I ordered the salmon which they do cook to the temperature requested. So nice tender but skin had a perfect crisp.   For appetizer we did order the cornbread muffins with the best tasting butter I ever had and duck fat fries. I'm a Midwesterner so requested ranch with the fries. \"All they had was a house made bacon ranch.\" And the problem is?... it was delicious!   Ordered ice cream sandwiches for dessert with a snickerdoodle cookie. Delicious!   Foods great, amazing service! Wanted to speak with manager to compliment Chris and the staff but we were going to see a show. (I did send an email in case Searsucker does read this). Highly recommend! Will be back again.",

The first one was great. The second was good but it didn't seem like it was muddled/mixed well enough. I also ordered the potato fries, pork chips and short rib sandwich. The portions were much bigger than I expected. Everything was good. The potato fries were great. I liked the chipotle ketchup. The short rib in the short rib sandwich was good. I think the bread was a bit too thick so it wasn't balanced. I ended up picking out some of the meat and the onions. The pork chips were good but I thought the sauce was just a tad too sweet. I think Seersucker is a solid choice for Happy Hour.",

Bad texture. No crunch. Tomato soup with grilled cheese was good. I had the Cobb salad. Over dressed. My wife's salad didn't come. Mediocre bartender didn't get involved. Called her over. She said she'd check on it. I asked to have it boxed as we waited about 10 minutes for it and I was over the uncaring service and bad food.",

    "text": "The wife and I dined at Searsucker on a Sunday night.  We had no problem getting a table for two at 7:30.  We started off with a round of drinks.  Searsucker's cocktails and house-made infusions were solid.  I had the Kinda Old Fashioned ($18) made with Jack Single Barrel whiskey, Montenegro Amaro, Ancho Reyes liqueur, sweet vermouth, old fashioned syrup, and bitters.  It was boozy and bitter with the right amount of sweetness.  The wife's Jalaberry Strawpeno ($13) was a jalapeno and strawberry infused tequila with lime and agave.  It was a nice, fresh take on a margarita.  For our food, we shared orders of the Blistered Shishito Peppers ($11), Calamari Steak ($16), and Fish & Chips ($42).  All of the dishes were tasted good to outstanding.  The Fish & Chips, a beautifully presented fried whole branzino with waffle cut, sweet potato chips, was excellent, but I felt a bit overpriced.  The Blistered Shishito Peppers were the closest thing to a miss for me.  They were blistered, but possessed a wilted texture that seemed like they were more steamed than roasted over a fire or in a hot skillet.  However, the Calamari Steak, thick cuts of calamari deep fried to a perfect fork tenderness and topped with a chili honey glaze, was the standout dish and the best fried calamari dish I've ever had.  Searsucker was a pleasant surprise.  Frankly, given the lineup of celebrity chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas, let alone in Caesars Palace, Searsucker seemed to me to be somewhat of an afterthought, a backup plan restaurant choice.  Searsucker deserves better than that as they're easily Caesars' best bet for tasty comfort food.",

We started off with the pickles and jalapenos, not too salty but a slight kick at the end balanced out the saltiness of a pickle. The calamari was amazing, the first bite had spicy tastwhich complimented the gamy taste of calamari.The chorizo corn has a citrusy first bite and the aftertaste puts in a slight kick that makes you feel like you are eating more than just corn. The short rib with the combo of the mashed potatoes and gravy melts in your mouth, the tenderness of the short ribs is off the chain.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want to satisfy your pallet.",

I got a drink that was lychee and sake based and it was just ok. Normally those are my favorite type of drinks. We got the tuna poke as a starter and that was 5 stars!!!! The tuna was deliciously seasoned and loaded on a very delicate crisp seaweed chip. I could've eaten 10 more of those. For dinner we settled on the 2 lb lobster meal for two along with potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The lobster came out quickly and was perfectly grilled with a side of butter of course. My only complain is this meal will likely leave most people hungry. Most of the meat is in the tail which wasn't much and there's some in the claw. Thank god it came with sides. Both Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were good. For dessert we tried the bread pudding which came loaded with lit s'mores. Cool concept but the timing is pretty important here and the s'mores were very burned by the time the dish arrived at our table. It looked pretty carcinogenic so we didn't really touch it and the bread pudding was just ok. The dessert menu was pretty limited and the other 3 options were all cold. Would've liked to see a chocolate cake or something. Overall great experience. Apps and entrees seem solid. Cocktails and dessert are more of a hit or miss.",

Works for me.   We came here for breakfast/brunch every day during our stay. At times felt like the service was a little slow. But the food was well worth the wait. The service was also incredibly friendly, personable, and knowledgeable of their menu. We did not have one bad meal their.  The pricing is not cheap. Not super expensive either. But hey, everything is over priced in Vegas. At least the food is so good, the value for the money spent redeems itself.   The booths fill up quickly, so I recommend getting a reservation if you have a group of more than 2-3 people. Otherwise, there is a pretty good shot you can walk right in and get a spot at a bar top table or at the bar.   Definitely a go to while staying at Cesar's /)",

My wife pre-ordered the whole-beast feast as a surprise birthday dinner for us, her mom, and our daughter and her husband who we flew out to stay with us over the Christmas holiday. The pig was fantastic as were the sides! When we were almost finished, the busboy stopped by and asked to pack up the leftovers, to which I replied \"I'm still picking at it, give me a few more minutes\". Fast forward 10 minutes, and the waitress stops by the table, grabs the leftover pig (about 2/3) and hustles it away, not once asking about packing up the leftovers. So I assumed (incorrectly as it turned out) that she would have someone in the back do that for us. Well, after dessert she hands me the bill which included the drinks which were not part of the pre-paid pig, and left. 10 minutes later, I had to ask the busboy to send her back to the table so I could inquire about the leftovers. Her response was priceless, i.e. \"Oh I think there was a miss-communication, and I tossed it\". REALLY???? You tossed a $300 pig??? Anyway, I asked for the manager, explained the issue, and she tried her best to remedy the situation by comping our drinks and desserts. Still falls far from fixing what was supposed to be a special occasion. Food great, but in our case the waitress was nothing shy of incompetent!!!",

    "text": "A friend invited me to Searsucker for a late dinner on a Friday night. Our reservations weren't until 10PM, and the place was bustling when we arrived. We were seated within 5 minutes and led to a small table by a window. Our server and busser introduced themselves promptly and looked quite dapper, if I might add. The menu was filled with interesting choices, but the vegetarian selection was miniscule.   BALLERINA AND THE CZAR ($14): My friend started off with this specialty cocktail, which she said was tasty. I was content with my fancy glass of water. :) 4/5  HABANERO & CORIANDER PICKLE: This was FREE with our Yelp check-in. I hate pickles, so I didn't touch this small appetizer. My friend said they weren't that spicy, but cautioned that she has a heightened tolerance for spicy foods due to her Vietnamese upbringing. 3/5  CHEDDAR PUFFERS: Our server brought these out to us, and I assumed they were complimentary. They reminded me of the bread served at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Casino (except the ones at Eiffel are better!). I thought they were kind of bland. 3/5  QUINOA ($23): This was the only dinner entree option available to me as a veg head. I have difficulty describing this dish. My friend called it 'earthy' after she tasted it. I called it 'grainy'. It was a-okay. 3/5  HANGER BUTCHER STEAK ($32): She ordered the steak and loved it. Awesome presentation, too. 5/5  ERMAHGERD SUNDAE ($10): We shared this and settled on it mainly because the name sounded so hilarious. Not a fan, though. The brownies tasted stale and store bought. The 'gelato' tasted like regular ice cream. 2/5  VIBE: It was extremely loud inside the restaurant and difficult to carry on a conversation. The music was on full blast and the place was packed. I was yelling, not talking. As for the window view, at first we were happy to have the view, but that soured when guys waiting in line to get into Omnia next door began tapping on the glass window and gesturing at us through the window. :/ 2/5   SERVICE: Perfect! Our plates were cleared away quickly and we were checked on frequently. 4.5/5  Worth a Return Visit? I'm interested in trying out the Happy Hour menu but don't see myself coming back for dinner. I'm hoping it will be less rambunctious earlier on in the day.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #176",

    "text": "Wow, where to begin...  I was lucky enough to go to Searsucker with a large party of people. I say \"lucky\" because this allowed me to try a lot of different menu items.   First things first, though the seating and the vibe are perfect for large parties, the restaurant is extremely loud. Also, we were seated at a long, rectangular table, so in order to speak to someone across the way, you either had to shout or temporarily move seats. This made for a difficult dining experience conversation-wise.  However, I have relatively no complaints about the food. Though I would like to mention that I was tricked into eating a Rocky Mountain Oyster (bleh, yuck). For all of you sweet, innocent souls out there (like myself) that have no idea what Rocky Mountain Oysters are, please read the following statement; they are testicles. That's right. If the idea of eating such a thing makes you squeamish, then do not order the Cowboy Caviar. I honestly cannot attest to the taste, as my opinion is now completely jaded by the fact that I had never, ever wanted to eat bull testicles in my life. Ever.   Moving on; I personally ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Chipotle Ketchup. This was, of course, delicious because...well, because it's fries all done up fancy and such. I also enjoyed the smoky ketchup, and I'm not necessarily a fan of chipotle in the first place. Along with the fries, I ordered the Tomato Soup with Toast and Cheese (AKA, grilled cheese). Yum, yum, yum was it good. The soup is drizzled with some sort of pesto sauce on top. The grilled cheese is greasy, melty, and super-cheesy in all of the ways that matter. Finally, I also ordered the \"Spicy\" Shrimp Bacon Grits. And I died...from deliciousness. Wow. For all of you that are wary of spicy foods, I would say the spiciness level is \"medium\". It's slightly hotter than mild, but not too hot. In the picture I've supplied, it looks very different from how you'd expect grits to look but rest assured, they're there - under all that shrimp and sauce and delicious flavor.   As a party, we also ordered the Hamachi Tostadas, the Artichoke Hearts with Cheddar and Mozzarella, the Brussels Sprouts and the Scallops (entree). Of all of those, I particularly enjoyed the artichoke dip the best. It comes with cheesy toast, as you can see in the picture.   All in all, eating at Searsucker was quite the experience. I only wish I had heard about it when I was still living in San Diego, as they also have a location there. Hopefully Reno will get one eventually as well! It's definitely a must-try.  Happy feasting!",

They bugged us constantly as we ate, then literally disappeared for 15 minutes after we finished. I cannot stand bad service when I'm paying at a high price point.   Best part - Short ribs with horse radish mash. So so good. Worst part - over cooked New York that the waiter held in 'better light' over my friend's head to show us that it was 'what we ordered.' So unprofessional and quite rude. My husband is much more forgiving and just ate it since the waiter argued with us about the degree of cooking. We were sharing so I actually didn't eat any steak. Thankfully my friends shared the short rib with me.   Pear goat cheese salad was good. Kale Ceasar was good. Mac and cheese was good. Butter potatoes were good. All was just good. Vegas, Ceasars Palace, Saturday nights....I want great for the amount of money we are paying.   I won't be back. Not with 100 other options in a 1 mile radius.",

We split: Cheddar Puffers: tasty, these were complimentary and packed a little heat that surprised me  Duck Fat Fries: ok, nothing to rave about  Caesar Salad: I wanted some greens so I knew this wouldn't be too exciting but I needed a salad. I asked for dressing on the side and the waiter said it is very lightly tossed in so I said ok, as long as it's light. It was drenched in dressing. Ugh  Short Rib: Best thing we ordered- delicious and very large portion  Squid: Our waiter recommended this and I thought it was awful. Hated the sweet and sour sauce and whatever they put on the side (tasted like cream cheese) made it worse. Just gross.  Manhattan Cocktail: My husband loved the Manhattans here- he can be pretty picky so I thought I'd make note of that :)",

There's an Omnia package on the menu if you eat $75/per person where you can expedite the lines. We opted OUT of that option and just ended up snacking here.  First of all, the shareable appetizers are not shareable. How am I suppose to split ceviche with someone when it comes on one tostada? R u dumb. Skip the beef tartar, skip the $20 crab cake, and just get a bunch of the mussels. Super tasty mussels with andouille sausage. That's the only thing I would come back here for.",

She seemed to know the menu like the back of her hand. She mentioned a grilled salmon as the special that night and I went for it. She explained the entree with such details I couldn't say no. Once the salmon got to the table it was noticeably raw. If we wanted sushi we could have gone to a sushi restaurant. I asked the waitress if maybe I could get a salmon that was cooked through as this raw fish wasn't to my liking. She said \"oh yea I forgot to tell you it comes pink\" what?! Lol anyways once the second plate came to the table is was the exact same one that they took but only this time they they threw it back on the pan to warm it up and brought it back. By the way this is a \"health code violation!\" I was supposed to get a brand new salmon! Did you run out of salmon ? You had to bring me the same cut up salmon and drizzle a little sauce on the side! I was so embarrassed for them! Never again! Thanks for charging me full price $165!  Very classy.",

Chef Malarkey who gained instant pop status from ABC's \"The Taste\" and various Food Network stints wins hands down with this upscale concept restaurant.  Fans are truly won over - at least this one and his wife, mom & daughter too!  Our Day After Christmas ambiance was cheerful and lively but not too loud. Dine in the back of the restaurant for intimacy, front for people watching and a big bar with TV's. You can also watch the kitchen operate closely from some tables in the middle of the room.  Our servers Tammy & Mark were attentive, knowledgeable and gracious.  Prices are standard (for high end Vegas eateries) between $15-$30 a plate.  Must Have Appetizers: Tomatoes & Burrata with sourdough toast Fried Eggs & Ham Warm salad   Must Have Mains: Shrimp with Spaghetti Squash Short Ribs & Mashed Potatoes   Must Have Deserts: ALL  Tip: Make your rez (like we did) and eat before 7PM to fully enjoy without the \"packed & loud\" scenario trendy restaurants unfortunately adopt.",

If you are by the bar, you can watch sports and ppl passing through the casino for fun.  Quality is also above average and affects pricing which will leave you around $30 for a main. Service is quick and in line with the concept overall, and handles your requests with a smile.  The decor inside gives a cool atmosphere and the open kitchen sets the right ambience for the room. Even though it can be a sports bar, you may not wanna go here if you want to combine a quick bite(read cheap bite) with sports.   I would instead consider this as a new fresh restaurant, where even though you agreed having dinner out, can get away with sneaking in some sports and still leave the place with a ring on your finger.",

We were seeing a show at the Colosseum and came a little early for some appetizers and drinks. It was surprisingly not busy for a Sunday night so we grabbed a seat at one of the hightops in the bar area. Our server Emily was right over to go over the HH menu and take our drink order.   HH at Searsucker has some great deals. All food is $9 and drinks are $4-8 depending on if you order beer, wine or cocktails. I had the house chardonnay for $6 and it wasn't bad. We ordered the duck fat fries, lollipop wings, sliders and ahi tacos.   The food starting arriving very quickly. The ahi tacos (3) came out first and they were fantastic. The ahi was super fresh and served in a wonton shell with limes and guac on the side. Next out was the lollipop wings. 9 wings covered in buffalo sauce served with blue cheese, carrots and celery. Another excellent dish. The fries and sliders arrived last. The fries were hot, fresh and crispy. Dusted with prosciutto and parmesan they were a perfect match for the sliders.   Although the sliders were our least favorite of the four apps, they were still good. Slightly over cooked and quite small but the flavors were good. Debating on getting another order of the ahi tacos the dessert menu was brought out. As soon as I saw the rocky road bread pudding I knew I couldn't pass it up!   The bread pudding was delivered with the marshmallows still on fire, melting on top of the chocolate bread pudding. With a side of fresh whipped cream and chocolate gelato this was an outstanding dessert that we quickly polished off. The food and service here is as good as when it opened two years ago and Im glad we came back.",

We ordered the calamari, fig toast, grilled octopus, burger, and hangar steak. The steak was extremely chewy and disappointingly under-seasoned. The burger was nothing to write home about. Only thing that stood out was the fig toast - the grilled bread was toasted well, the cheese was fresh & flavorful, and the figs perfectly sweet. Wish this placed lived up to the great reviews but don't think we'll be coming back again.",

Only negatives were the service is hard to come by if eating at the bar and can be a little slow (but attentive). Once brought to our server's attention, Charles came over to help and he was an amazing server. The only other negative were the drinks were not strong.. which is sad because they tasted great!",

Basically, each person in your party must spend $50 and you will receive a \"chip\" that will allow you complimentary expedite meaning, you do not have to wait in line. Now you definitely need to pay to get inside the club, so this chip only lets you come in front of the line. Try and get on a guestlist by looking up on IG etc, then you may get lucky and receive complimentary entry as well. (We wanted to go see Zedd, so we used this chip and got on a guest list that gave us free admission until 1am; arrived around 11:45 and the club was already packed!!!!)  Anyhow, for the food, we had the tuna tacos and octopus for appetizer. Honestly, I expected more but it was very mediocre, not especially tasty or flavorful. For our entree, we ordered the lobster which was AMAZING. The lobster came with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts that paired well with the lobster.  Would I recommend this restaurant? Probably not, but if you are trying to get into Omnia yes, I think it is a great deal.",

I started with my fave, a dirty martini. Very well made. Perfectly dirty, like I like it. :P  We were a group of 7 women so we all had cocktails and for food starters, we opted for the raw choices of poke and ceviche. Devine. Served very rustically on wood boards in mason jars. I kind of like the presentation....it was cute and unexpected. But the theme is throughout the decor as well, so it fits.  We moved on to share the calamari (and ordered another as it was THAT good) and the shishito peppers (just like everywhere else).  I ended with scallops that were wonderful and a few others had the salmon or steak. Everyone was pleased and satisfied.   This is a great option in Vegas.  It's a bit loud, but it IS in the casino. And of course, as most places in nice Vegas hotels, it's a bit pricey. But if you are out for a decent meal in a cute setting, definitely try Searsucker.",

I wish I would have gone back every single day I was in town for the bone marrow, the macaroni and cheese, and the short rib. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fevery.single.day&s=e5e78f800d6386cd9da8f8b1f5207e783931954e1b716eb320d05484d0bd4afe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">every.single.day</a>. I love.. LOVE macaroni and cheese. Not the thick baked stuff with crusty breadcrumbs on top.. I'm talking about luscious silky cheese that is thick enough to coat your tongue and every aspect of the pasta. They used pinwheel pasta and it was so unique yet so perfect and original at the same time. The cheese sauce was perfect.. salted wonderfully and with a depth of the best cheese taste. I could drink it! The short rib fell apart with just a touch and was also seasoned very well and the bone marrow was like meaty butter slathered on the perfectly toasted bread that it was served with. Don't miss out on these items if you are in vegas! I will definitely be checking out their other locations as well!",

    "text": "I picked this restaurant for dinner with friends last night because I had heard that it was a good place for gluten-free dining. I have celiac disease. I felt confident that I would be okay because there is a blog post on the restaurant's website talking about being able to accommodate gluten-free and to let the server know and they would help with the menu and inform the kitchen to take special care to avoid cross-contamination. After we were seated I told our server I had celiac and would need help with the menu. He was not very interested in helping me and even said \"you can read the menu and pretty much figure what you can and cannot eat.\"  To start, we ordered the tomato and barrata. I confirmed with our server that it came with bread and asked for that to be served separately so that my non-celiac friends could eat it. When it came out the bread was on the plate not separately as I had asked. I had a couple of bites of barrata that was on the side of the plate without bread but that was all I could have because the rest touched the bread. There is no way the server informed the kitchen of my dietary restrictions. I should have stopped everything at that point but we had already ordered all of our food and two of my friends had ordered the hamburger which they only make 20 of per day. We had also ordered the yellowtail crudo but it never came out and just decided to forget it since our server was so inattentive. It was clear he did not want to be there.  I had the salmon which was over-cooked and the entire dish was way too salty. I could only eat half. My friend's scallops were also too salty. My other friends that ordered the burger said it was fine but nothing special. For the prices, none of this is acceptable. It was very disappointing and now I am sick today.",

Then, when a person refilled my water, he didn't even realize that he splashed a significant amount of water (much more than a few drops, it was like a little puddle) onto my plate/steak. My colleague suggested I ask for a new plate because my steak was getting soggy, but I was with coworkers so I didn't wanna be \"that guy\" so I just sucked it up.

Had a reservation at 5 pm right when they opened as a co worker had a total rewards voucher for $15.00. If you have one read the fine print as this particular place isn't part of the program. Regardless we stayed and decided to treat ourselves. We both ordered the burger which only 20 are made. Once they are done they are done so come early! Upon talking to our server Caesar he really hyped this burger up telling us it's superb and that even the ketchup is made from scratch. Needless to say when it came it was everything we expected. The fires were just the right amount of salty. Soft but not soggy. The burger was amazing! A must try for all those who don't want to be disappointed. The only thing I will say is they serve Pepsi. I know for many like me it's a deal breaker but they do serve Sierra Mist and water.   I also want to add aside from the amazing decor and use of abstract lamps their restroom is so clean it was such a pleasure to walk in to a restroom with the same decor and liveliness.   Will be coming back with my co worker again and bring family too!",

No matter what you're hungry for this place has it. Steak, lobster, oysters, muddled, scallops, chicken, wings, fish tacos...the span of this menu is impressive and quite tasty.

Searsucker is a southern influenced gastropub, with a really great happy hour featuring $9 Old-fashioneds and $2 oysters (not just the standard bluepoints everyone is giving you nowadays.) We also had sliders and bone marrow ($2 per bone at happy hour.)  The star of the visit was the fried pigs ear. They are cut into small strips, marinated for hours and then lightly fried, for a more delicate texture than you're expecting. They are deliciously salty with an appropriate hit of tartness.   The oysters come prepared with a mignonette of micro mint and pomegranate. Each oyster rests on a thick salt bed, which we viewed as a little fussy. I also took off the mint leaves as they interfered with the oyster flavor. The pomegranate, on the other hand, is a great pairing.  The old-fashioneds were prepared classically and well-balanced. This is definitely the best choice for happy hour in Caesar's Palace and perhaps the entire Strip.",

    "text": "After spending many hours researching the best place to eat Thanksgiving dinner in Vegas, we wound up here completely by chance and had hands down the best turkey meal of our lives (sorry grandma, but it's True).   Once we got to town we noticed that EVERYONE was doing a holiday dinner. Prix fixed menus were constantly in our faces, and we felt overwhelmed by all the different choices. Should we keep it casual, find a swanky place and dress up, hit a buffet, hide and order room service? The last one was starting to sound very appealing.   We were sitting across the way at the Alto bar watching the Cowboys game, when I spotted their sign advertising $50 a person for an all you can eat dinner. Wanting to be done with the search I asked around our table if that would do, and we all agreed to pull the trigger and make the reservation so we could relax and get back to the game.   We came back that evening expecting to find a buffet setup with long lines, but instead were treated to a practically empty restaurant and sat in an intimate candle lit booth. Our waitress brought out waters and not even 10 minutes later we all had the piping hot thanksgiving special plates sitting in front of us.   We were given the choice between white, dark, or both cuts of turkey. Each plate also came with mashed potatoes, green beans with crispy onion strings, fresh cranberry sauce, and sausage stuffing. Because we were feeling gluttonous, we also started with the $5 plate of biscuits with whipped butter and honey. HEAVEN!  The turkey was incredibly tender (I refuse to use the M word but it was), the mashed potatoes creamy and rich with the addition of the sour cream sauce on top, the green beans fresh, and crispy onions on top deliciously salty...just man. It was delicious.   None of us really cared for the cranberry sauce, but that's usually an afterthought anyhow. I'm just as happy with the canned stuff if I'm honest and theirs was a little too citrusy for me. And while I enjoyed the sausage stuffing, I found myself missing the meatless version so that it wasn't in competition with the turkey.  Truly dynamite meal though. We all got seconds (some even thirds, don't judge) and left blissfully dreaming about getting back to the room and changing into stretchy pants.  It was hard to determine what their normal cuisine is as we saw deer antlers, fish bones, and ropes decorating the room but honestly? I don't care. I would come back anytime and would be happy with any plate they set in front of me. It was absolutely delectable and worth every freaking penny.",

    "text": "This is a happy hour review! Prices listed below are happy hour prices as of 4/29/15.  The Skinny: excited to try their happy hour menu items and they are all pretty good albeit not without flaws(3.75) service is prompt and efficient at the bar(4) value: portion sizes are very generous for a happy hour menu and the food is solid for the most part. Service was good at the bar. (3.75 bump up to 4 starred review)   FYI -  signage is poor in Caesar's Palace so it is hard to find.  Searsucker is tucked away close to the sportsbook and next to the Omnia dance club.   We were totally jived to try out Searsucker's happy hour menu. We got duck fat fries ($4), the farm bird lollipops, the Caesar salad, the Strawberry/goat cheese/walnut salad ($6 each),  the tuna tartare,  the squid ($8 each), the crab cake and the short rib ($10 each). We were slightly disappointed that the burger on the online happy hour menu was gone but with their sizable menu,  this was easily overlooked. We were surprised but the serving size was very generous for each of these dishes especially the aforementioned $10 items and the two salads. We probably won't order that much again knowing how big the servings are.   Here is the run down:  Duck fat fries with tomato jam ($4): satisfying with a nice smokey flavor from the tomato jam. The hubs would have preferred a slightly crisper texture but I found them to be pretty good in that regard. Would order again.   Farmbird lollipops + hot sauce + Bleu ($6): these were more like chicken meatballs on a skewer. The flavor wasn't really hot per se. It tasted more like sweet and sour rather than hot sauce like -  kind of like Swedish meatballs. The Bleu cheese flavor was rather muted. Overall, this dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Pass on this.   Strawberry + champagne + goat cheese + walnuts ($6): get this! Delicious and lightly dressed,  the flavors married beautifully together. Protip: the goat cheese is adhered to on the bottom of the plate so make sure you give a good scrape before you dig in. Portion size is generous and could easily make 2 side salads.   \"Caesar\" romaine + kale + egg + parm ($6): okay Caesar. Honestly, the dressing did not have that  garlicky, fishy (from anchovies) punch and missed that hit of acidity in the end. The dressing was a bit too salty as well. Serving size again was very generous and could easily stand in as a light meal on its own. Would pass and get an extra strawberry/goat cheese salad instead.   Tuna + radish + taro + spice ($8): pretty good but it is still tuna tartare. The spice is very mild. The tuna was pretty tasty and good quality and worked well with the taro chips. Would order this again depending on the mood.  Squid \"sweet heat\" ($8): the good -  exquisitely tender squid that melts in your mouth, delicious sauces; the bad - dressed too heavily with the Thai chili sweet sauce so we lost the crispness of the fried batter. Overall would be better if both sauces served on the side to maintain the crisp exterior layer. Good dish but needs some refinement -  maybe order again with the sweet chili sauce on the side to see if that changes the dish.   Short rib \"the harlot\" + horseradish + fried onions ($10): very good portion size and easily could be a main entree sized meat portion. Fork tender short rib with a hit of horseradish near the end.  Served over mashed potatoes,  this is a very comforting dish. Personally I thought the gravy could use a little more acidity but that I think is more personal taste. The hubs wolfed this dish down. Would recommend.   Crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + airlines ($10): if you like crab,  you will like this. Lots of crab meat in chunks with minimal filler. A tinge too salty,  it worked well when mixed with the aioli and a good squeeze of lemon. Would order again.   Overall,  our dishes were very good in general and portion sizes for a happy hour menu are very generous. There is enough variety to satisfy most people,  sample some good eats for a reasonable price (for the Strip).  Service was excellent at the bar -  our water glasses were promptly filled and check taken care of quickly. Food arrived swiftly to the table as well. A solid 4 star experience.",

    "text": "I have always loved every dining experience I've had at Searsucker whether it was the gaslamp, northern San Diego or Vegas location but this one in particular was my absolute favorite.   The food tasted more delicious somehow but could be courtesy of all the drinks I had which by the way, are incredible. I love spicy drinks and the jalaberry strawpeno was fantastic. We also got a bottle of wine and the Cabernet was probably one of the best I've ever had.   Appetizers:   Pork belly + egg: Get it. Don't even think about it. Just do it.   Mussels + chorizo: If you love mussels, you must get this. The small pieces of chorizo and sauce go so well together and the mussels are super soft.   Bone marrow: One of Searsuckers' rival (in my opinion) is Whiskenladle and I know their bone marrow dishes get compared all the time but honestly, they're totally different. Searsucker's bone marrow has some sweetness to it and the brussel sprouts that come with it tastes so good so don't skip it! It's not just decoration. Haha.   Entrees:  Tomahawk: If you are considering any of the red meat options, get this one. Let me say it again, GET THIS ONE. It's the most expensive thing on the menu but I promise it'll be the best ribeye you'll ever have. After the first bite, you won't even remember that it costs 85 dollars. And it's ENORMOUS. I always complain about 12 oz steaks being too small but our table of 3 meat loving girls couldn't finish it.   Filet + lobster sauce: This dish is great on its own but after having the tomahawk, it was really nothing special and that's saying something because it's delicious.   Brussel sprouts + walnuts: I don't even like brussel sprouts and thought this was SOOO good. So much flavor and doesn't taste like its a vegetable at all.   Deserts:   Smores bar: I'm not a huge fan of the smores combo but this one was different. Everything went together very well and the ice cream is amazing.   Milk + cookies: So simple yet SO good. They put sea salt on the cookies which enhanced the flavors and the cookies are so soft.   Now for the best part about our night, our server Chris was the best!!! How he managed to deal with 3 very exhausted but energetic and delirious dental sales girls is beyond me and I'm sure he is some part super human. He took such good care of us and really made our night super memorable. I would've given him a hug if it were appropriate to do that with your servers. Haha. If you could request to be sat in his section, I would definitely ask.",

    "text": "So, funny thing....I have recommended Searsucker San Diego to many friends, who have loved it. But I have yet to go myself! So, when a location opened in Vegas, I knew I had to check it out.  First things first - park in the Forum shops valet or self parking, both are convenient to the restaurant.   The restaurant was easy to find. If you continue past the sports book and poker room, you'll see Omnia and Searsucker is just next door to that.   Note that they are only open for dinner (currently - not sure if that will change). They do offer a decent happy hour menu Monday - Friday.  The decor is very rustic and warm. When you enter, there is a large bar area with booths and seating. I was surprised at the size of the restaurant. While not small, it was smaller than I expected (in a good way). I love the open kitchen concept and that there is actually seating at the counter.  Here's what we had for food:  Duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup ($10) - REALLY good. Do yourself a favor and order these.  Shisito + ponzu ($7) - They say about 1 in every 10 is really hot, so be careful! I got a hot one and survived, but I love spicy stuff. There was tremendous flavor on the peppers and I'm glad I tried them.  Egg + Bacon \"pork belly\" ($19) - This was tasty as well, although the bacon was a bit too thick cut (IMO).  Cowboy Caviar ($11) - I've had Rocky Mountain Oysters before (at Coors Field) and swore to never try them again. Although, they were not properly prepared there and these were PHENOMENAL! Really, really good. You would have a hard time believing that this wasn't a fancy chicken nugget.  Shrimp \"spicy\" + Bacon grits ($17) - Delicious! I am not a huge fan of grits, but these were well made. The spicy shrimp was really delicious and basically the star of the dish though.  Beet salad ($16) - I've had an obsession with beets lately. This was really good and I especially enjoyed the fried goat cheese.  I would say that it's best to get a bunch of plates and share. The main entrees are on the high end, pricing wise. We were all happy with the smaller plates.  We also had a couple of signature cocktails, which were good. The beer list was decent, but nothing spectacular, which is a bit disappointing for a restaurant based in San Diego.  They will be offering a late night menu, on the nights that Omnia is open. I would expect this place to be a total shit show on those nights! The staff were all super friendly and knowledgeable, and Chef Malarkey was quite nice as well. I look forward to going back soon for a visit and trying some of the things we didn't get to try this time!",

    "text": "Food was pretty good, but service is literally awful. I showed up a bit earlier than my party, so I had a drink at the restaurant bar from the happy hour menu while I waited.   When my party arrived, we sat down and asked for a happy hour menu, but the waiter told us that they only do that at the bar. I was incredulous. They were going to make us pay FULL PRICE for a drink that was $6 less FIVE FEET AWAY AT THE RESTAURANT BAR. A friend asked if we could walk to the bar, grab a drink, and come back, and the waiter said we could. So we did that twice. So stupid.  During our second WALK to the restaurant bar from our table to get drinks for our party, my friend ordered from a male bartender: 2 \"Snakes in the Grass\" and 1 PB&J old fashioned. While the bartender was making them, a female bartender came over and I ordered 2 \"Snakes in the Grass\" and 1 glass of white wine. 6 drinks total. I noticed that the male bartender stopped making the three drinks my friend ordered from him. The female bartender brings over just 2 \"Snakes in the Grass,\" and I tell her \"we asked for 2 more of these.\" She responds \"oh so you ~did want 4.\" This was extremely annoying because we clearly put in 2 separate orders, but apart from that she was obviously unsure of whether we wanted 2 or 4 \"Snakes in the Grass,\" but SHE MADE 2 INSTEAD OF ASKING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE STANDING 1 FOOT AWAY. Mind you, this wouldn't be a problem if they offered happy hour menu AT OUR TABLE 6 FEET AWAY.  THE CORNBREAD HAS BACON IN IT, but that ingredient isn't listed on the menu. We ordered cornbread as an appetizer, but when it came out we realized that there was bacon in it. The vegetarian in our party is the one who ordered them, and we also had a Muslim friend in our party who doesn't eat bacon. The waiter did NOT tell our party there was bacon in it because he forgot, and he mentioned that this issue had come up before. We asked to exchange for the biscuits.  My salmon was good. The drinks were good. It does not excuse this terrible service.",

    "text": "We chose this place because my husband wanted a steak, but we were unimpressed with other steakhouses' reviews and lacked any formal attire. We thought we would give searsucker a try and were pleasantly surprised.  Menu is reasonable, and we started our with potato fries (cooked in duck fat, side of chipotle ketchup). They were fantastic. The ketchup was too hot for my liking, and overpowered the subtle duck flavor, but my husband really liked it.  We ordered the braised ribs for me and the prime New York for my husband. The ribs came on a bed of mashed potatoes with 3 onion rings on top. The potatoes were supposed to be horseradish, but good for me they were not. The first bites were magnificent and I would absolutely get them again. Tender, rich, and flavorful!  My husband ordered his steak medium and, unfortunately upon his first slice discovered they had turned it into beef jerky. The waitress apologized and brought it back. She then returned to inform us that they had no more New Yorks. We expected the worse, especially since my husband really had his heart set on a steak. To our pleasant surprise, the waitress said the head chef was very sorry and that we could order anything as a replacement, suggesting their most expensive steak, a ribeye. Given the opportunity, my husband opted for the Tomahawk ribeye. A 36oz behemoth with an equally sized price.   I don't have all the words to describe the Tomahawk. It was amazing, melt-in-your-mouth, savory steak. That is what steaks should taste like. It's hard to fathom the $145 tag, but if you have the desire or a special occasion, do it. Do it. It's huge. It's fantastic. It's memorable.  The staff was good, the food was excellent, the atmosphere was great and they have an extensive beer and wine list, plus fun specialty cocktails. We will definitely return!",

The duck fat dipped fries were nice and the ketchup had a little kick in it which was nice.  The shrimp remoulade was pretty tangy.  Overall, a nice place to get a bite right after work.

We were sat immediately when we arrived.  Our server warmed up after a couple of visits to our goofy table.  Strangely, some drama found Searsucker that night.  As cocktails were being delivered a young lady and her boyfriend started shouting at each other and ran into the back area of the restaurant.  This high level of tense arguing continued until security showed up to usher them out.  Searsucker handled it perfectly.  The good was awesome, best mac-n-cheese I've ever had (that's a BIG statement).  I would go back right now if that were an option.",

I had the steak cauliflower it was decent flavor and I kept my calorie count in check but seriously there was nothing but mashed up gooey looking tomatoes served with it. No sides whatsoever to compliment the dish. The spice chicken my husband had was flavorful but he ate every morsel and also had nothing but tomatoes on the side which he does not like and didn't know they were part of the dish. So basically we are saying we felt like suckers for choosing Searsucker :( wine list and prices not fair definitely overpriced and I'm not referring to overpriced as expected.",

We had ahi Tuna and squid (a cool way to serve essentially Calamari) with sweet and sour sauce and remoulade both super fresh and delicious. For entre hanger steak with fingerling potatoes, also perfectly executed.  One other thing to note is the fact that the entire menu is a good value and not overpriced.

    "text": "Searsucker has given me a new reason to visit the strip. As a native, I tend to avoid the area. This restaurant makes you feel right at home, and takes you away from Vegas just for a moment. From the hospitality, to infused liquors, Searsucker has won me over in every single way. My first trip here was a Yelp event, where of course we were spoiled. However, when I returned for a ladies night with Jessie B., we were still spoiled! The chef sent out a complimentary dish when we first arrived which really set the tone. The service was stellar beginning to end. And the food, let's talk about the FOOD!  The salads are so fresh, I literally could eat every single one of them. The crab cake is the best crab cake I ever have tasted. That particular night Jessie and I shared the special, a fettuccine made in house topped with fresh pesto, shrimp, and mussels. WOW. My mouth waters as I type. I could see the chef from where I was sitting and he seemed so passionate when plating our dishes. You could tell they really care about what comes out of their kitchen.  After our meal we went to the bar to try one of these amazing cocktails. I went with the Bad Bad TRoy Brown, and I only needed one! It was strong, but perfectly made. The bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink.  The manager even came by the bar and spoke to us, mentioning happy hour. Speaking of happy hour, I need to plan a trip back here, and soon!",

Also even though I made reservations, they sat us at these very high tables by the bar. I am having a family dinner and it got super loud. I think it would have been better by the kitchen on regular tables.   I picked this place because it's inside the Cesar's Palace right by the sports bar and we were going to watch Celine Dion (amazing show btw-a must see!)  Now for the food:  spicy hamachi & avocado, fresno chili / cilantro / oil-comes in a jar. Was't too spicy, but the hamachi was fresh and goes well with the wonton chips  beef tartare & sourdough,capers / mustard / egg yolk-also comes in a jar with wonton chips. Perfect amount of seasoning.   blistered shishito peppers ponzu / sea salt-something I just love to eat so I have to always order this if I see it on the menu. Thumbs up  bone marrow* fresno chili bourbon glaze-i'm not a fan of bone marrow because it is too fatty for me, but this was amazing! best dish of the night. The crispy brussel sprouts that it comes with gives it that nice texture. Spread the bone marrow on the bread, top it off with the sprouts and some cilantro and you have the best thing you've ever eaten!   mussels* chorizo / chili / cilantro / corona-they give alot. make sure you dip the mussels in the broth to give it that extra flavor  duck fat fries-crispy and delicious.    beer braised short ribs,horseradish potatoes / crispy onions-this was their signature dish and it was so disappointing. Lacked flavor, was dry, and we told the waitress. She did offer to make a new one, but we were so full and didn't want another one.   Stick with the appetizers only!",

The Brussels sprouts were roasted in a wonderful sauce, I could've done with the walnuts. And the fries were an enormous order of fries, perfect with Parmesan and bbq sauce! Their Mai Tai (don't judge, I was on vacation) was a unique recipe including lime juice and almond syrup! Loved it. Only took off one star for the server that was very overwhelmed and the place seemed severely understaffed for the night. He did great with the recommendations though.",

I got the bacon and eggs and the brussel sprouts. My husband got a steak and asparagus. He's a picky eater and not easy to please, and nearly a week later, he is still talking about how great the food was. We shared the cookies and milk for dessert, and it was such a fun, cozy way to end a fantastic meal.  The open kitchen only adds to the experience.

    "text": "Searsucker? That is quite a different name though don't be fooled by it. This restaurant that labels itself \"The New American Classic\" has quite the bit of flavor packed into it. The appetizers, entree, and desert was a delicious and full-filling meal. Let's now eat our way into \"The New American Classic\" Searsucker. This fabulous restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in the casino section.  The first appetizer I sunk my teeth into were the lollipop wings ($18.00) these were some of the best wings I have ever had. The lollipop style they were served as were brand new to me however.  Genius! I exclaimed they were perfect; the meat all on one end was a masterful idea for dipping. They were smothered in buffalo sauce; they were spicy but not enough to scare me away. They were served along with a blue cheese fondue that was creamy and went great with the lollipops of a carnivores dream.  Next I had something very new to me and straight from the sea. These were raw oysters ($3/each) they were served in a bucket of ice and served along with a pomegranate topping. They smelled very fresh and fishy almost as if they just netted and prepared them right then and there. From a bite they have no flavor but with the pomegranate topping gave it a sweet flavor and made them easier to go down the pallet.  Then I went on to my favorite course the entree I had beer braised short ribs ($35.00). They were served along fried and crispy onions ring all on top of mash potatoes smothered in gravy. The ribs were tender and I could cut they with just the edge of my fork. The mashed potatoes were very light and fluffy and went with the meatiness of the ribs. Onion rings I love to death however the ones I have were a bit too greasy for my taste and I wish they were a bit crispier on the fry.  Last but truly not least was the desert crafted in my dreams three ice cream sandwiches ($18.00). Two were served vanilla and one...CHOCOLATE!!!! (those who get that sponge-bob reference you are amazing) there was a side of whip cream, Nutella, and mocha cream. The cookies on the sandwiches had that great homemade taste and the ice cream tasted freshly made. The chocolate sandwich had these wonderful chocolate almost coco puffs placed around it. The Nutella had a great chocolate punch and the whip cream was great. The mocha cream however was a bit strong but great on the sandwiches.  Ah! America the home of the brave and free with some of the best food you could taste. Searsucker is only a bite of what you can have here and is a great first stop. Warm and filling the food is just like its decor a truly great foodie stop.  Let's see where my taste buds take me next!",

We had 5-6 appetizers they were all good but my favorite was the the bone marrow.  The bone marrow was soft and silky accompanied by an array of different garnish to only accentuate the taste!  I had the short ribs, truly amazing maybe one of the best I've ever had with tangy mashed potatoes.   I can see this for both a group or date night!",

    "text": "I'm a complete sucker for Searsucker!! Unbeknownst to me I've eaten at the Searsucker location in San Diego, but that experience failed in comparison to the one I had here in Vegas. Let me begin by saying the staff and their customer service was on point!! Shout out to Adrian and Phil who made our dinning experience at bar top absolutely awesome!! Every staff member we spoke with, whether they took an order, dropped off food, or simply checked on us was super friendly and pleasant. Kudos to the Hiring Manager.   Now for the scoop on the food...ahhh the delicious food. I tried three entirely different \"Smalls\" aka appetizers:   The calamari was a thicker cut, almost steak like, sans tentacles. I really appreciated how meaty and satisfying it was. If you're a calamari fan this is a must try.   My favorite dish of the night was the Mussels and Chorizo. Talk about mouth watering flavor. Thick cut cubes of chorizo marry perfectly with the fresh mussels to great the BEST tasting broth I have EVER eaten. I swear you could drink the broth as a soup.   The third app I devoured was the Mushrooms and Burrata on Texas Toast. As someone one who LOVES mushrooms and cheese this was my dream come True. Although it was a tasty dish, I was so obsessed with the mussels that it fell kinda flat it terms of flavor.   I decided to wet my whistle with their signature Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. It was light and refreshing. I think because it is mixed with cucumber water and because I chose to sip it slowly the ice melted which made the drink taste super watered downed, but my new friend Adrian added a splash of Sprite (per my request) which brought it back to life.   Overall it was a GREAT dinner/evening out. I will certainly be returning to sample more delicious dishes and to check out there pretty stellar Happy Hour menu!! You got me Searsucker and I'm not at all mad at you!!",

    "text": "Second time visiting Searsucker and this place has gone downhill, bigtime. We arrived with no reservation to grab a quick bite and were told the wait was over an hour for a table. Seeing there were plenty of vacant tables we hopped on opentable and made a reservation for 15 minutes later. The hostess wasn't thrilled about this, but I'm not sure why she didn't just accommodate us when we arrived.   Since we had 15 minutes to kill we figured we'd sit at the bar to pass the time. After being ignored for at least 5 minutes a bartender approached us. He took our order and we then were approached by three different bartenders asking if we had been helped yet. Again, weird. Needless to say, we ditched the table and just decided to eat at the bar.   Appetizers arrived in less than 5 minutes. Awesome, but it definitely makes you feel like nothing is prepared to order. Either way, our salad and tuna poke tasted great.   Then we waited for the entrees.   And waited.   And waited.   We asked three times and each time the response was \"oh it's coming right up\"  After 35 minutes we had to leave for an event so we asked to close our check and were charged for our entrees that we never recieved. Weird.   We let the bartender know we never received the entrees so we didn't want to pay for them. He said \"oh, sorry\" went and adjusted our bill and dropped it off without saying anything. After he ran our card he dropped it off and said \"Thanks guys!\"  Honestly, not something I would expect from a restaurant like Searsucker. The entire experience was irritating enough that there's no real reason to return. When I go somewhere to eat, I generally hope to at least be served my food.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this restaurant in Vegas while walking towards Omnia Nightclub at Caesar's. The club was not open yet and we had about 1 hour to spare so why not a little grub before clubbing? I had actually bookmarked this place before our trip so by faith, we ended up here.  The dining area was nice but we just sat the bar and got a bunch of appetizers to share and a specialty cocktail for each. For grub, we had Crispy Pig's Ears w/ cilantro, lime, sea salt, the Duck Fat Fries w/ parmesan, prosciutto, herbs, and the Bone Marrow w/ fresno chili bourbon glaze. Both presentation and taste were on point. Ears were crunchy and tangy. Fries were perfectly crisp but the Bone Marrow was the clear winner. It was so tasty and slimy in very good way. Wish we ordered another one. For drinks, I tried the Snake in The Grass made w/ cucumber gin, bruised mint, lime, and soda. It was well prepped, refreshing and strong. My buddy got the Japanese Manhattan made w/ Toki Japanese whiskey, sweet vermouth, orgeat, sake, and bitters. He let me have a sip and it was also good and potent. Sharable apps start at $5 to $18 and specialty cocktails average about $14.  Sear Sucker was a great find in Vegas. Reasonably priced tasty food, well prepped strong cocktails and nice bartenders. Definitely a good spot to have dinner or pregame before a night of clubbing or gambling.",

We made a reservation and I'd advise you to do that, since Searsucker seems rather popular. It's a good sized space with modern furniture and a menu that encourages sharing. We started with corn muffins ($5) and hot damn!!! these are some tasty bites - a bit spicy, full of bacon and served with sweet butter. Yum!   For dinner, I had a Cobb salad ($16?) which was ok - I asked for dressing in the side and never revived any at all. See: service, below.  My dining companions opted for more meaty choices and seemed happy. Our side of mac''cheese ($16) was overly salty but used wagon wheel pasta which made me happy.  Service...yeah, not the best. Our server was honestly kind of bitchy for no reason. I didn't get a side of salad dressing and didn't want to ask because she was attitude-y Judy & I didn't want spit infused ranch. I'm guessing with a different server this place would be 4 for me.",

    "text": "What a bummer. Took some friends back after a fantastic first-time experience at Searsucker and ended up with some major disappointments.   What was still good: Most of the food, ambiance, drinks.  What I learned this time that I didn't know last time: Happy Hour pricing is a gimmick and only available at the bar.  What slipped this time: - The duck fat fries - for lack of a more eloquent way to put it - sucked. It was my FAVORITE dish and I was so eager to order it again. I was the uber hype woman for this dish. Imagine my disappointment and frankly embarrassment when my friends tried it along with me and found it to taste exactly like normal fries. No more savory/umami flavors. I asked the waitress what's up. She said they switched over to fresh not frozen fries recently. I'm not a food chemist so I can't say if that affected the taste of what but it was night and day. I would not order this again. - The buffalo wings are midget (ahem, I mean 'size challenged'). Super duper tiny. - Service. Our waitress was present, but sometimes we had to wait awhile for her to come around, otherwise we didn't see her at all. May not be her fault in a busy part of the restaurant. She was also brusque and a little sarcastic, which I didn't anticipate given the warm service we received the first time by someone else. - Website says you can get complimentary entry to Omnia. We asked about it on the way out. Turns out you need to buy a certain amount of food for each complimentary entrance, which is reasonable. What bemused me was that it took them about 10 minutes to sign off this perk for us. Required a manager's approval so we had to wait.  Don't know what happened this time, but the allure definitely faded. If this was my first experience at Searsucker, I would not have returned.",

    "text": "One of the best dining experiences in Sin City.  Caveat: we ordered only appetizers and three servings of the same entree.  Spoiler Alert: Everything was perfect.  For starters, we ordered the short rib, calamari, shishito peppers, fried pig ears, buffalo wings, and fig toast.  For the entree, we ordered THREE of the same burger.  (Why three?  Because they only make twenty per day!  So we tried to corner the market... joking.).  So back to the food...  The notable plates were definitely the pigs ear (unless you are vegan or vegetarian). The ears were crispy, seasoned nicely to pair with an IPA or lager.  On the other end of the spectrum was the vegan fig toast which had a sprinkle of salt and pepper to liven up the flavor and lightly lathered with honey to qualify it as a potential dessert.  The burger was confusingly good... smoked, touched with BBQ sauce, melted cheese with some grilled peppers. Why confusingly good?  It was a bit of every perfect burger I've had but I just couldn't put my palate on which one...  it probably had bacon in it.   The wings were \"cute\" because they were so so small; however the texture was excellent and the buffalo wing sauce was tangy but not overwhelming. As for drinks, Searsucker won't disappoint.  They boast an award winning Old Fashion, along with a good list of beverages.   After all, it's Vegas.  With all the restaurants, Searsucker won't disappoint. I would give it a five star but like all Vegas restaurants, it's a tad over priced. Nevertheless, if you are in Vegas, near Caesar's and crave some new American cuisine, check out Searsucker.  It's cool, different, and wiling to push the envelope.",

    "text": "Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup - SPOT ON.  This was a creamy tomato soup and the grilled cheese was gooey white cheddar on a fantastic sourdough.  The two were in perfect proportion - not too much of one or the other.  I'm a simple girl and this was probably my favorite dish.  5/5  Calamari - chili honey glaze and apples.  Very tender and tasty.  The flavors were good and it was one of the best calamari dishes I have ever tasted - the meat was not even the slightest bit rubbery.  The waiter recommended this and it did not disappoint. 5/5  Charred Octopus - ginger, sesame and sour orange.  I would not recommend this dish - when they say charred they mean very charred.  We couldn't even eat the terminal end of the tentacle because it was like eating a crunchy stick. 2/5.  Roasted Cauliflower - pickled chilis, pine nuts, citrus.  Cauliflower is pretty much the only vegetable that I like and this one was TERRIBLE. Flavorless and almost slimy.  Do not recommend. 1/5.   Bone Marrow - fresno chili bourbon glaze.  Compared to the other items on the menu the price point for this was excellent at only $15 (at most restaurants the bone marrow is significanlty more expensive than the rest of the menu). It was good but as always a small portion.  5/5.  Came here on a Friday night with my coworkers while at a conference.  We were seated at the booth nearest the entrance so it was open to the casino area.  I actually don't recommend that exact location even though the booth itself was comfy and the perfect size to accomodate lots of food dishes while still permitting conversation.  However, we didn't really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant because we didn't get the lighting and music because we were so exposed to the walkway.  However, overall I very much enjoyed the dishes and drinks at this location, besides the few misses as listed above.",

    "text": "BE AWARE OF FOOD POISONING with NO REFUND. The four of us went to Las Vegas for a family trip. For dinner we went to Searsucker and ordered seabass with salads.  Within 30 minutes of consumption, all four of us got severely sick with major diarrhea. We had tickets to a very pricy show right after dinner and we each had to run to the closest bathroom twice during the show. After the show, diarrhea still continued till the next morning. I called the restaurant right away so they will be aware of the bad dish and not to serve it to others.   Talked to the manager, Ashley Oglesby, she apologized and said she will call me the next day to see how we are all doing. Well, she never did. I got the feeling that she didn't believe me, since she kept saying it could've been from what we ate for breakfast. Not so, since we were totally fine all day long.  When I followed up in a couple of days I was told to fill out a detailed and lengthy questionnaire form and maybe eligible for partial refund. It took me 25 minutes to fill out all the questions and in return they sent me back the wrong paper work to fill out again for partial refund that I never received. For me, it is the principle, the way we were treated, misled and accused. They deserve a big fat \"O\" star for ruining our family vacation.",

    "text": "My weekend dinner experiences with Searsucker have always been on point.  Although pricey and the service can get slow, Searsucker has always delivered on food.  Service 3.5/5 Their service is like Pizza. Even when it's bad, it's pretty good.  I've had some amazing experiences and other times where we had to find our server throughout the evening.  Everyone has always been consistently friendly with great vibes from previous visits.    Food 5/5  Everything I've tried at Searsucker has been a great experience.  Presentation and the quality of the dishes have always been top notch.  Here are some of my faves: Beef Tatare & Sour Dough: A Searsucker staple for me, the egg yolk brings this home   Tune Poke & Shaved Taro Root: Always fresh poke Lollipop wings: you heard that right, wings.  Their sauce is at another level, I'll order every time. Bone marrow: Just pure bliss and good times.  Highly recommended Beer Braised Short Ribs:  Ribs have always been tendered and very tasty. 36oz ribeye tomahawk: Fun to share, fun to eat and fun to share on social media  Value: 4/5  The Searsucker bill adds up quickly.  The \"Jars & Sliced\" dishes and sides are in the high teen price range and you're going to want to sample many.  Signature dishes and the grill stars around $30 and goes as high as $155 for the bomb 36oz ribeye tomahawk. The Signature dishes portions are very large.   Get ready to throw down some cash for a great and unique food experience  Ambiance: 4/5  It's a place to see and be seen when you dine here.  It's a very casual neo 1800s seersucker vibe with brick walls and lights hanging from ropes.  Every weekend dinner experience had people socializing at the table for long periods of time.  The dishes were designed to be shared so everyone is enjoying their food experience together.  This is a catalyst to socialize at the table, throw in some drinks (for us a lot) some music and you're having a great time quickly and the hours pass.    Expect to spend some money but bring your favorite foodie friends and/or drinking friends as you're going to be sitting down for awhile.  It's a great place to catch up over some great food in a loud but fun and social restaurant.  Expect to see some attractive people eating and pre-gaming before they hit up the Omnia nightclub next door.  I believe they still offer expedited entry (literally no wait) into Omnia if you spend a certain amount but verify with the restaurant.  It's the best and easiest way to get into Omnia if you don't have a host.   Enjoy...",

I was actually surprised the place was only half full and felt a little concerned I made a poor choice in restaurant especially since it was on the expensive side. However, it turned out I had nothing to worry about.  I split the Chicken Cobb salad and Mac n Cheese with a friend and both were super delicious. Especially the Mac n Cheese. And the portions were surprisingly large we couldn't finish either. Also tried their Habanero & coriander pickles which were free with Yelp check in and as strange as they sounds they were actually really good.   it wasn't happy hour but they had 2 drink specials going for the night. A cosmo and a \"bay breeze\" which was basically vodka and tropical juices. It was tasty and on the strong side for only $8/ I came in expecting to spend over $100 but between the drink specials and portions large enough to split I managed to come in under $60, so just know this place doesn't HAVE to break your wallet. It's also right next to Omnia so well placed for pre-turnup meal and drinks. I will definitely be returning in the future.",

We got free pickles with a check in with yelp. It was good, but super salty, so you have to eat it was other things in your meal the balance out the saltiness. The portions were small, so we had to order a lot of food and it was so pricy.  I felt like our server was awkward and forcing us to order things off the menu that we didn't really want. I probably would try other places when I am in Vegas again.",

Personally, I think this is a little on the expensive side, so I went in with higher expectations. All in all, things were just fine.   Duck Fat Fries - 2/5 Perfectly fine fries. But I couldn't taste the duck fat at all.   Blackened Tuna Tacos - 4/5 I'm not usually a fish fan, but I actually loved them! Hubby, who ordered it thought they were only ok.  Mac N Cheese - 3/5 This isn't on the Happy Hour menu and was $18. The portion is definitely large enough to share and considering what else we'd ordered we couldn't finish it all. However, it wasn't $18 exciting. I could've used even more Cheese and I don't think I saw a trace of bacon the menu claims.   Another HH menu item that someone near us ordered were the sliders and those looked pretty good. Maybe we should've tried those.    The good thing is the service was attentive and friendly and the decor is super cool. Depending on what you want, this might be the place for you.",

This is a very nice bite that just makes you want a good drink. Speaking of which, I had an excellent cocktail called a Paper Plane made with bourbon. It was boozy, not too sweet, and just a little citrusy. I wish I had had another! The short rib and horseradish mashed potatoes was excellent. The best dish was two large bones with lots of marrow, crusty warm bread, and a little parsley and brussel sprouts salad. I could've have ordered more of this alone and several drinks and left there very, very happy. The only thing we did not like was the fries cooked in duck fat. A few on top of the pile were crispy and tasty, but the rest was soggy with excessive grease and lacked salt. The ambience is festive at the bar during happy hour. We sat at a table, but I think I will sit at the bar if I go during happy hour next time. If you prefer a quieter dining experience, sit at a table. The service was excellent.",

We started with Beef Tartare & Sourdough, Hummus & Toasted Pita, Biscuits and Calamari Steak. For three that was a ton of food. The Tartare was a huge portion and wonderful taste, the Hummus was perhaps the least exciting offering but still good. The biscuits were to die for and you have to use the infused honey, you'll want a bowl! The calamari was served in steak finger fashion rather than old boring rings and again the sauce was excellent. We then ordered a filet, short ribs and fish and chips. The fish and chips get served as part of an art deco arrangement of the whole real fish, very impressive. The short ribs were so soft you could have cut them with your napkin and the filet was cooked perfectly. I warn you every dish came out piping hot, get your drink ready. You will have an unbelievable visit!",

    "text": "After attending the Elite event at Seersucker, where everything was absolutely delicious, I knew that a return visit would be in the near future. So when Dyanna L. invited me to dine with her on a weekday evening I excitedly accepted.   Seersucker was rather empty when we arrived just a few minutes after our reservation, I chalk this up to happy hour having just ended. The service we received was excellent during this visit, attentive but never overbearing.   Dyanna and I shared all of the dishes we ordered, including the complementary cheddar puffers sent out by the chef. Here is a quick run-down of what we noshed on:  Brie appetizer - This dish featured made-in-house peach jam rather than the cranberry mentioned on the menu. So decadent, we joked that this could have been our dessert rather than our starter.   Cobb salad - We asked our server to help us pick between a couple of salads, and this was her recommendation. The bleu cheese, the roasted tomatoes, the bacon, the dressing...  everything melded together wonderfully.   Crab cake - The only item we ordered that we had during our previous visit. This crab cake has ruined all other crab cakes for me.   The Special for the evening - house made pasta with pesto, shrimp, mussels and a spicy tomato sauce. If this is ever an option on the menu or as a special, get it. The tomato sauce wasn't very spicy, you could taste the freshness of the pesto, and the pasta was cooked to perfection.   For dessert we had the lemon cheesecake, which was a lovely combination of tart and sweet.    After we ate we decided to stop for a drink in the bar area, where we were served by a bartender that was not only adorable but knowledgeable about the spirits. I ended up  having the Ballerina and the Czar, which the waitress warned would taste heavily of the cucumber water which was in it. I found it to be very refreshing.   Seersucker was a wonderful choice for our ladies night out, there was literally nothing that could have been improved upon during our visit. This will be my go-to spot the next time I have friends or family visiting that want good food in a somewhat casual setting on the Strip. I am also looking forward to taking advantage of the great happy hour prices in the very near future.",

    "text": "We tried Searsucker fourth of July weekend and really honestly wanted to like it. We did our research and we were excited to try several of the menu items. We were \"greeted\" by the two completely unenthusiastic hostesses and taken to our table. Our server Tammie was knowledgeable when it came to menu and drink suggestions. My husband wasn't thrilled with his unbalanced rather sweet \"signature\" old fashioned. But being in Vegas we were both still looking forward to enjoying our dinner.    We were seated in the open kitchen area, which we love! and were shocked to watch the chef touch every raw garnish of every plate of food and then wipe his hands on his apron-less pants, face and phone. Not appetizing in the least. We then watched the manager (at least that's who think was the manager) touch every bit of face, eyes, nose, lips and then proceeded to touch the raw garnish on a dish before sending it along with a food runner. Obviously once we saw a few of these incidents we began to notice even more of them. Kind of like a train wreck- you just can't look away!   My husband and I both work in the industry and are sensitive to some of these issues.  We are never THAT table (unhappy without merit or reason) but we found ourselves being irritated with the compounding service issues. Everyone was on their phones almost the entire time! And I don't say/write this lightly.  The chef, the \"manager\" and a woman who we assumed was an assistant manager were on their phones for significant periods of time, constantly texting. I get it, we all have lives and communicate constantly but step off of the floor and send your quick text but to stand out openly in the dining room for 5 plus minutes on your phone makes no sense and is unacceptable.  The \"assistant manager\", a younger woman, did not put her phone down once, seriously not once the entire evening. We were laughing about it by the end of the night, that's something that we have never seen before.  Neither the food nor the signature cocktails were a saving grace unfortunately.  We tried a few appetizers wanting to get a good idea of the concept and the Chef.  We started with a couple of the \"jar\" dishes, the first was the crab, very one note.  The crab was hammered by Sriracha mayo and gargantuan pieces of Avocado.  Next the tomato and burrata jar, was perhaps the \"best\" appetizer we had, but the burrata itself was begging and pleading for salt, which is not offered on the tables, lol!   We also ordered the bone marrow and pork belly both of which were incredibly sweet.  We didn't even touch the third bone because the sweetness was overwhelming which honestly is saying something because we are both huge marrow fans.  The only thing we remember about the pork belly was how sweet it was.    Lastly we ordered a grass fed NY steak with two sides.  We ordered the strip medium rare, it came out BLUE, completely cold in the middle.  As we took 5 minutes contemplating sending the steak back we realized we were also missing one of our sides.    We NEVER send things back to the kitchen but were at this point rather frustrated and wanted to at least finish our meal and get out of there. The steak was returned to us warmed through a healthy rare but at least edible.  When the corn finally arrived it was by far the best thing we ate that night.  It had a nice balance of smoky, spicy and creamy. The cauliflower was good at first but quickly became rather one vinegary note.   As a last note, while the manager and Chef were steps away from us the entire 2 plus hours we were having dinner, neither of them bothered to acknowledge, greet, check-in, chat, smile, or honestly look at us.  Why even have an open kitchen if you aren't invested in engaging the dining room????   This was the LEAST expensive dinner we ate on our trip and the MOST disappointing by far. IMO service was awful, food was mediocre.  All in all we left feeling frustrated that we wasted an evening of our trip at Searsucker, what a bummer!",

    "text": "Dined here on a Saturday night for a party of six and had a great time. Drinks were tasty and refreshing. My favorite was the strawberry jalapeno margarita. Our server was very knowledgeable and suggested some scrumptious dishes. For starters, our table had two orders of the following: bone marrow, calamari steak and duck fat fries. For the main course we had the 36 oz Tomahawk ribeye with sauteed mushroom side, New York Steak with corn jalapeno, two orders of fish and chips, braised pork, grilled cheese and tomato soup for the kids. Everything was delicious but the Tomahawk was a tad too salty and cooked Medium rather than the Medium-rare we preferred.  The star of the meal was the bone marrow. We all agreed that the next time we come back we will just order ten of those bone marrow! We were too full to try any desserts. Our server gave us chips for free expedited access to Omnia. It was a busy night for Omnia being it was its two-year anniversary and Kaskade as the main dj but we did not have any problem getting in. I'm already planning on coming back when we go to Vegas again next month.",

Having become a foodie thanks to my wife, plus being a fan of Chef Brian Malarkey since his initial Top Chef contestant season I was excited to check out Searsucker.  Even with running a bit late, my friends and I were seated right away and greeted by our server Emily as well.  We ordered drinks and continued to review the menu to see what we wanted to eat.  I had the Big Eye Tuna with a side of Duck Fat Fries that was simply out of this world.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right with a nice shaved vegetable slaw to go with the dish.  The only thing that would have made the dish even more enjoyable for me was some wasabi to go along with it.  The duck fat fries were pretty tasty too as they had I believe pancetta bits and parmesan cheese sprinkled over them as well!  It was a different preparation than I have previously and enjoyable just the same.    One of my friends ordered the lollipop buffalo wings that were tasty as well and I was told that the blue cheese aioli was pretty awesome for the wings.  The other main courses that were ordered was the scallops and the filet steak.  Both of those entrees were just as delicious according to my friends.  The only way the experience would have been better is if Chef would have been at the restaurant and I would have been able to meet him in person!  I did Tweet to Chef on Twitter and he did like my tweet!!!  I hope to one day get to either of the locations in San Diego with my wife so that she is able to enjoy the incredible food!!!",

A friend invited us to join him to see Mariah Carey at Caesars, so this was that opportunity! I was so excited.  The Pros - The marketing is cool. - The place looks cool. - We were serviced by 3 different guys and they were all very helpful and attentive! - We all agreed that the calamari was the best item we had.  The Cons - Poor Selection. I wasn't crazy about the menu items so much so that I ended up getting a salad. Getting a salad at a place as nice as Searsuckers is like going to Basking Robins & getting vanilla ice cream. - Duck Fat Fries. GROSS. If I were a fast food character, I would be The Fry Guy. The aftertaste of the 'duck fat' was gross. Seriously gross. I barely touched the dish, and even told the waiter that, well, they were gross, but he said that he loves them & he left them on the bill. Shannon & Scot were in agreement about the grossness. - Expensive. I don't mind having a crazy expensive dinner, but I just wasn't expecting it here. The Cesears website has it listed as $$ and Yelp has it as $$$.  My Cobb salad with shrimp was $34. My martini was $14, but the Apple Martini listed on the menu was $35. Hmmm. All in, we spent $235 for 3 people. I had a salad & fries, Scot only had an appetizer, Shannon had a caesar salad and we all shared the calamari.  For the record, Shannon & Scot rated Searsucker higher than I did. There are several locations nationwide, so I must be in the minority of disfavor. Maybe you will like Searsucker more than I did.",

But I shall share with you all my enthusiasm for this place. The food is unpretentious, well, at least by new American cuisine standards. Having recently dined at fellow Top Chef contestant Richard Blais' restaurant (Juniper & Ivy in San Diego) where I found the food to be very fun and creative, but lacking heart and taste/satisfaction, Chef Brian Malarkey's restaurant really knocked it out of the park for me. The food is simple, and instead of getting fancy, they focused on just preparing the food perfectly.   Of note, their duck breast confit was perfectly prepared. Not a single complaint. Even the bed of white beans it sits on top of was delicious, and I haaaaaate beans! Their scallop dish is priced a bit on the high side, but they give you three very decent-sized scallops, and again, it was made perfectly.  You must try their sweet and spicy squid. Even if you're not a fan of squid, this dish totally won me over. I don't know how they prepare it but the squid is not chewy at all. It's got a great texture that reminds me of scallops. Anyway you must try it.   The only disappointing dish was the short rib. Ugh. If I see short rib on one more menu I'm gonna scream, but the waiter recommended it. It was dry, bland, and boring. It even sat on top of a pile of boring mashed potatoes. Avoid this one.   I will definitely be back again!",

The scallops were delicious and were plated on a bed of corn.  The food was decent and I would come back again to try other things on the menu.  edit: If you plan on going to the Omnia nightclub after dinner, ask the hostess at the restaurant and they can give you an express token that lets you cut through the Omnia line quicker.",

The lollipop wings were good, chocolate sammies were delicious, duck fat fries were overly seasoned with not even a hint of duck fat taste, but the worst item I had was the braised pork butt.  The pork butt had no flavor besides the pickled tower laid on top.  It was confusing, the pickled vegetables dominated the flavor of the meat, not even letting the True taste exude through the anticipated braised flavor.  Even the smell of the pork had no inviting aroma, very bland.  Staff (such as our server, Cesar who was nice enough to have the pork butt and fries removed from our bill due to our dissatisfaction) and service were excellent, but the braised pork butt...was a bunch of \"malarkey.\"",

This place has some awesome staff and a great bar team that takes care of the patrons across the restaurant. They have some cool and tasty signature and craft cocktails that are certainly worth a try (or two, or three!) The food is well prepared and very well presented - they put their time into the dishes and make sure that it's done to your liking. The pricing is a bit high, but for an on-the-strip option is a great choice and well worth return visits. Happy hour is great and you can get some nice deals too - so keep an eye out!

He definitely worked for his tip!   As far as the food itself, I would give it a 4 star rating.  Got the sword fish, which came with a side of sauce - chose the chimichurri (per our waiter's recommendation- great job) and a side of Brussels and walnuts, which were tangy and yummy.    My husband ordered the pork butt (which I hear is actually pork shoulders), plus the side of duck fat fries.  The fries were good, but we didn't feel like they were anything super special.  The butt was big and had a lot of meat in them, and they were thick and juicy.  Hehe.   It all came out about 140$ including tax and tip , and 2 speciality cocktail drinks we gave our friends who were celebrating their birthdays there yesterday.   Would come back again.",

Cute petite blonde.  She gave excellent suggestions and got us out in time for our show.    They've taken a few things off the menu since they first opened. Careful not to get your heart set on these amazing Yelp photos. Not to worry, everything is yummy!  They didn't give us any bread so we ordered the biscuits.  Can't go wrong.  Served with butter and honey.   Didn't feel like I was in the mood for her suggested calamari steak.  I am so glad she suggested it!  It was cooked to the perfect texture, firm and tender.  Even the sweet chili sauce that I wasn't thrilled about, paired really well!   We ordered the ribs instead of steak. Good thing our server told us steak would take too long to cook for our time frame.   Super tender atop mashed potatoes.  A few nice onion rings.    Bone marrow.  Comes with a good amount of Brussel sprouts (which I love at this restaurant). Plenty of marrow.  Maybe too much for two girls to eat.     I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of dinner!",

A perfect, light appetizer.   Entree - Jumbo Mexican Shrimp with Pear Ginger Chutney and a side of Roasted Mushroom & Herbs: When you order \"From the Grill,\" you select either a meat or seafood, then choose a sauce and side dish. The jumbo shrimp is legit, folks. Searsucker doesn't skimp on size and quantity.The shrimp pairs well with the chutney; although, I wish more was provided. As for the mushrooms, they were decent.   Dessert - Chocolate Trifecta: From the smoothness of the pudding, to the crunchy chocolate \"paper,\" I enjoyed most of the flavors and textures of this dessert. However, the cake was bland, but it might have been created intentionally to balance all the flavors. The other desserts on the menu might've done a better job in satisfying my sweet tooth.   FYI: The restaurant charges approximately 2 bucks per beverage refill -- I didn't think my Diet Pepsi was worth the extra cost; maybe another beverage would've. *shrugs*  Service: No complaints; great service.   Overall: Many of the menu offerings may not sound new and exciting, but Searsucker adds its own twist. To me, the food was fine, but I wouldn't order the same items.",

Living in San Diego for the last 20 years, am well acquainted with Brian Malarkey's hospitality style and it mates up VERY nicely with the Las Vegas \"thang\".  The entire joint was jumpin' at 6:45 pm(Happy Hour daily 5:00-7:00 pm) on 1/21/17, Heather was our mixologist/server and we were instantly happy and relaxed.  I picked the \"Blueberry Ginger Smash\"-Old Forester / ginger / honey / blueberry / mint($8.00)...it was tremendous, packed a punch and had great flavor.  My friend had the Ballast Point beer, can't remember which flavor or how much it cost.  For eats, we had the Sliders($9.00 for two/order two, you'll want it!)-chipotle / cheddar / bacon....like a chipotle aoli topping, the beef was a nice size, two/three bites, juicy and flavorful....very, very nice, will be watching in the future to see if that stays on the menu.  We also got the tuna tacos ($9.00 for three) which were equally dilish!-blackend ahi / avocado/ jalapeno relish.  Deep fried shell, very thin and perfectly seasoned....highly recommended.  A word about Heather.....funny, smart and on her game, she will be sure to go far by reading the signs a customer is giving and paying attention to the small details.  Awesome person and Searsucker is lucky to have her!  Any Yelper in the vicinity of Caesar's should check this joint out and have a great time.  My experience was virtually without any fault, get to it!  Ambiance/Cleanliness-no bs here, it was good to go from the moment we sat down!...5 stars  Service- very nice, no major problems......4 stars  Food-see above for a food review, it was very good, but not in that rarified five star experience....a well deserved....4 stars!",

Located in Caesar's Palace, Searsucker is the restaurant by chef Brian Melarkey, who has had stints on Top Chef and the Taste. I didn't realize this until after the fact, I was just excited by the menu.  The vibe is modern chic meats rustic. Reservations are recommended, even during weekdays, which we did. We started with drinks- they have a decent wine list but also have an interesting cocktail list. I decided on the skinny jenny which is basically a moscow mule with lavender and other surprising ingredients. I loved it. It was a light, refreshing, and well made cocktail. For my meal I decided on oysters and mac and cheese (not in the same dish). The oysters were delicious and came with a refreshing pomegranate sauce. The mac and cheese was also quite delicious and very filling. Rich in flavor (and in cheese), it was definitely a tasty dish.   Service was very good throughout our meal. We were never without an empty water glass and our server made good recommendations. Yelp check in gets you a free appetizer of their house made pickles. It is a pricer meal but definitely worth it for the experience.",

Again, I expected they would do something for that, but it's either they forgot or I guess they just don't? Then what's the point of even asking if it's for an occasion or having a special note section? I shared a 32 oz cowboy ribeye with my boyfriend and initially we thought we wouldn't even be able to finish it (we would eat about 12 oz steaks by ourselves usually) but we actually didn't even feel that full after eating everything either and we also ordered two drinks and an appetizer. The 32 oz steak was probably weighed heavier for the bone or something because it was definitely not that much meat for it to be 32 oz in my opinion. For about $86 for the ribeye, I think I would go spend my money somewhere else. Nothing special about it. Meh.",

The whole place feels as if you're sitting in a food court with giant flat screens everywhere, including the cheap furniture and uncomfortable chairs. Poorly lit and loud.   And this is the sort of place where the servers try to jack up the bill as high as they can. You know, where they ask if you would like water and then charge you $9 for a bottle of Fiji without asking you. Or letting you order a $10 side of fries with an entree that already comes with french fries. As if the $65 steak entrees weren't over-priced enough.   The service timing is horrible, too. Despite the prices, this is NOT fine dining by any stretch of the imagination. These folks have no idea what they are doing when it comes to service.   And to top it all off, the food is bland and overly salty. Horrible. The $18 rib starter that we had was so dreadful that we scaled back our entire dinner plans and decided less would definitely be the theme of the evening.   The wine list is equally pretentious and over-priced. $125 for wine that retails for $15 at the grocery store. Other mediocre bottles that are priced in the $600(!?!?!) range. Please.  If you have very little experience with fine dining, you might mistake expensive for quality. Don't be fooled. Michelin is not going to be calling these folks anytime soon.",

I recommend getting the ceviche with some toast (to dip into the sauce).The pickles are also very good if you like spicy things.  I think next time I would try the mushroom buratta toast or the beet salad.  My only complaint was that the lettuce in the Caesar salad was too large. Smaller cuts would have been easier to eat.",

I'm sad to say the best thing I had that night was their Duck Fat Fries and the Cheddar Puffers. The item I was most looking forward to was the Tomahawk Ribeye but it was over-salted, which seemed to be a theme for them that night. I also tried the Duck which was nothing special and the Mahi which was tough and flavorless.   Honestly the only reason they got two stars was that their cocktails were very well done and the half priced bottles of wine for locals.   Overall I'm not in any hurry to return or recommend this place to anyone.",

They originally come with three per plate but our waiter was very sweet and said he would request for four. The scallops were very buttery and flavorful. They were on a bed of couscous with this green lime sauce that I ended up dipping everything in. We also had the brussels spouts that had a great crunch and nutty flavor. We had a side of the corn and it was so sweet and flavorful it went well with everything. It was a great dinner and atmosphere for myself and best friend to enjoy our time at our weekend girl trip in Vegas. Plus, because we dine there we got a token that allowed us to skip the line at Omnia which made our night even more! Truly a great restaurant, food, service and all.",

Stephen Lasale (I believe that was the name on his jacket) was literally the most rude person I have ever encountered in a restaurant. Stephen, who was in charge of all of the food leaving the kitchen, was consistently just speaking in a derogatory demeanor to each of his fellow co workers. Our table was seated directly next to the kitchen so you could hear everything he would say and see all of his expressions as well as how his co workers responded to him. We did ask the server what his issue was and from what we gathered, this is very common with him. The manager came over to the table and did tell us that he agreed with us and that he would appreciate a complaint in writing. I think that no matter what position you are working, customer service is the most important thing ...whether it is internal or external. Stephen, I think it's time to find a different profession.",

    "text": "Ugh, where do I start.   Went here as it seemed to be one of the more decently priced and more interesting places on the strip. Unfortunately it kinda sucked. Not the food but just about everything else.   There was a short wait for a table so we were offered a high top or the seats facing the casino floor if we wanted to be seated immediately. I like people watching so facing out was a great place to sit. We ordered the hamachi and jalapeno plate to start along with a couple of beers. The beers took a little bit longer than they should, but the amount of time the hamachi took was appalling. The insulting part was that this dish definitely fits the description of a small plate, it was basically 3 crisps with a slice of the hamachi and vegetables/sauce. The dish itself was great, the cucumbers and jalapeno  worked so well with the fish, tasted incredible. But for what amounts to 3 chips with a slice of fish on them to take over 20 minutes to prepare was pretty bad.   We had also ordered the Ono and a beet salad with goat cheese. The only odd request we had was for the goat cheese to come on the side which isn't a substitution or anything out of line. When the runner came out with them the goat cheese was breaded (not indicated on the menu) and mixed in with the salad. We politely sent it back and requested the goat cheese on the side and not breaded, and some silverware. Our waitress then came back with the salad sans goat cheese. She said she would get some for us and also offered to get some silverware. After waiting several more minutes I just turned around and asked the bartender for silverware. My Ono was no longer warm enough but it was very good.   Unfortunately lack of staff communication and attentiveness ruined this place for me. This is too bad as the food was awesome.",

    "text": "This is the best new restaurant in Vegas!  It's also a rarity being an eating establishment on the Strip that has a Happy Hour!  We went to Happy Hour after reading the great reviews.  We were not disappointed at all.    The food we ate was tremendous.  The crab cake was as good as we have ever had, be in Boston or Baltimore.  The shrimp and grits, while advertised as spicy, is not spicy enough to keep my wife's delicate palate from loving it!  The strawberry champagne salad is unique and superb!  As other people have stated, the portions are better than most Happy Hour foods.  We finished the meal off with the pumpkin dessert, very good.    What so many restauranteurs don't realize is that a good Happy Hour draws people in to sample your food, service, and cocktails.  If you pass that step, then you have customers who are coming back regardless of being Happy Hour or not. That is us.  We will come back for the pork butt, the filet, the salmon entree, the mahi, the scallops, etc.  The prices on those dishes aren't outrageous.  They aren't the best, but if you have dined on the Strip, you know you are paying top dollar.  At least here you get fantastic, friendly service and exceptional food.    FWIW, I've owned a restaurant, been a general manager, a bar manager, a bartender, and a waitperson, oh, and along with a dish washer.  I am judging this eatery on one visit, but boy, it was an unbelievably exceptional visit.    We will be back!  Oh, forgot to mention a pet peeve of mine they overcame.  Sitting at the bar, Searsucker had more than one person wait on you, EVEN ask you if you want another drink or some more water!  What mattered to them was if you had good service, not whether a certain bartender waited on you.  Good job, Searsucker!",

He didn't explain the menu when we had questions, completely forgot a drink order and then left us once our food arrived.

The busser tended to us with refills and was nice- Steve appeared with the bill and that was all.   Food was delicious and highly recommend the pig ears.

For food, $2 oysters, $4 chicken sliders and $2 bone marrow.  We ordered everything on happy hour. I wasn't too crazy about the oysters, and what they dressed it with. I think it was a cranberry with micro greens. It was too subtle in flavor and maybe I'm biased because I like my oysters dressed with a one two punch.  The sliders is actually really filling and one person can easily do with 2 orders if you're hungry or just one if you want to eat light. Chicken is tender and has a good amount of flavor in the sandwich.  The bone marrow is definitely what you come here for. The portion is good and it comes with bread. What really takes the cake in the bone marrow is that bourbon glaze. It balances the richness of bone marrow with that nice sweet flavor.  YUM!  We also got the calamari. It's actually really good! It has a sweet and spicy flavor that I love. It's not a crispy batter like typical calamaris and it is a strip steak and not the usual circle ones. So the bite is thick.   I'd love to go back again to try that ribeye, but because it's so big, I definitely have to bring a team.",

    "text": "I came here during 4th of July week last month to celebrate my friend's birthday. She was craving steak and after some long searching we found this spot right next to the club we were going to to see Zedd. I made reservations and we were seated right away. The service was phenomenal and the inside was very nice.   We were told before ordering that if we each order $50 worth of food (bill total of $250 or more) we would get tokens to get VIP entry/access to Omnia, where we were going anyways. So we each ordered enough food and apps to get this. The friend were really good and my steak was delicious! Something about their ranch is like the best ranch we've all ever had. We kept ordering it and then were told that they charge extra for the ranch. Thankfully our server was kind enough to only charge for a couple. I wasn't too crazy about my drink, but I loved my food and would definitely be back to eat here again.   Thankfully we were on a list for the Omnia and decided to do that and give our entry tokens away to another group. We saw that group later in the club and they said the tokens didn't work and they still had to wait. I'm really bothered that they pushed us to order a min per person to get these tokens and in the end they didn't even end up working.",

Our table was basically ignored until we plead with staff for service and attention, and when we did receive attention we were treated very rudely.   I emailed customer service about our issues following our last two visits, and unfortunately they ignored those, as well. I think this place relies on its prime location within Caesar's Palace, and doesn't particularly care about the quality of service it provides. It's too bad: the food really is quality, and there are some unique beverages on the menu. Unfortunately, the poor quality of service sours the whole experience. I don't believe it's a coincidence that this restaurant doesn't respond to its negative reviews or service concerns.",

Came with 3 courses and a cocktail for only $30. I had the tomato and burrata. Delicious. Came with thick cut toast and tastes reminscent of a caprese. Husband got the pig ears. They were good. Then I had the scallops. I loved it. Came on a bed of charred corn and tomatoes. Scallops were cooked perfectly. Then the warm chocolate chunk cookie and coconut gelato. The drink was like a Moscow mule. Tasty and we got to keep the souvenir cup.  Service was attentive and the manager got us a bag to carry the cups.  I would definitely go back. Definitely a foodie spot.",

Food wise, yellowtail crudo was delicious and fresh. Scallops with grits were a tad on the salty side but the flavors were complex and I want to commend them on the grits since this was my second time ever having grits and it went over much better than the first (which was in the south even). Overall a nice place to have dinner.",

    "text": "We were on the Strip at Caesars for a show and wanted to grab a light dinner afterwards. Seersucker had decent yelp reviews and was very close to the theater so we thought we would give it a try. Almost immediately after we sat down, Tyler, Our server came by to greet us, get our drink orders, and explain the menu. Immediately made us feel very welcome. Because we were not terribly hungry we decided we would go for three small plates and their corn bread muffins. For the small plates we got the calamari, the octopus, and the short ribs. Tyler told us that the calamari is one of their house specialties. He did not lie. They were quite good. The octopus is grilled. It was tasty. But nothing really special. The short ribs with mashed potatoes were short ribs with mashed potatoes, also nothing really special. The cornbread muffins with the specialty butter actually the highlight of the evening. Quite tasty for only five dollars, If you consider a restaurant charging for 7 really small muffins to be OK. So if the calamari was quite good, and the cornbread muffins were also good, and the service was excellent, why only three stars. You have to take into account value. Each of the small plates dishes were $18. I thought this was a little on the high side even for the strip. In addition, they nail you put $12 in parking.So when you figure 3 small shared plates, no adult beverages, and parking plus tax and tip was $90. Not a great value. Definitely would not go back here and would not recommend",

This place had availability during a busy evening in Vegas, and we were here before Absinthe, so I was on a tighter schedule than usual.   Service was wonderful.  My rib eye was accompanied by the duck fat fries, which were excellent.  A filling meal (I considered a salad also, but the food I ordered was plenty, and who needs vegetables? :D).  Simple but clean decor inside the restaurant, and it's easy to find if you're already in or near Caesar's Palace.  The restaurant entrees that other diners were having looked great, especially the seafood options.    Prices are high here.  About $150 per person with drinks and extras. But a solid choice.",

So I sat at the bar and had a drink and biscuits.  The drink - a \"Smoked Old Fashioned\" was really great.  Just fruity enough, a bit of campfire taste.  I also had a Long Island, which was adequate.  I ordered the appetizer biscuits, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was burned.  Literally - they arrived on a cast iron skillet and I burned my arm reaching over the skillet for my drink.  Didn't notice then, but the next day I had a blister on my arm, and it's still healing two weeks later.  But I contacted them (which wasn't easy, text messages or facebook page eventually found me the \"security department\" who relayed my message), and I was satisfied with their response; hopefully they will cover the handles in the future.  Because the biscuits were really, really tasty.  The only other strikes were the staff grumbling to each other about how hard it is to find a good job in Vegas, and the lingering stench of 50-some years of cigarettes and sorrow in the carpets outside in the casino I had to walk through to get there.",

I am a frequent visitor of Searsucker and have yet to find anything to complain about. However, in lieu of the incredible service I was lucky to receive last night, I finally felt it necessary to express my gratitude via Yelp.   I usually sit down at a table for dinner when dining here, but Big Mike insisted on sitting at the bar. His decision ended up being the greatest choice we could have made because of the incredibly attentive and friendly service we received from Jen, the coolest bartender I have had the pleasure of interacting with. And trust me, I've had my fair share of benders.   Jen was so genuinely kind and eager to please and make recommendations from the menu. She suggested some dishes I would never have ordered alone, and to my surprise, everything tasted better than ever before.   Big Mike loved Jen so much that he asked me to take his picture with her. She agreed, of course, without a glimmer of doubt in her eye - in the same fashion that she served us all night, in the way she made us feel comfortable - as if we were in the company of an old friend.  Jen made me love Searsucker even more and Big Mike won't stop bugging me about going back. I've never enjoyed eating dinner while sitting at the bar before last night. But if Jen is bartending, you can bet your life that's where I'll be.  So, thanks for being so rad Jen. Thanks for the delicious mixologist style cocktails and thanks for never making us feel like you were working. You look like you're having fun and that's so rare in the industry.   Cheers!   PS Peter Rabbits all night!!!",

We sat down and was greeted nearly 10 minutes after. First started with the specialty cocktail \"snake in the grass\" which was a over priced mint lemonade. I took a few sips and pushed it off to the side hoping our server would realize that I was unhappy with the specialty cocktail. My wife had the Malbec.   Started with the bone marrow which was actually the best part of our meal. For dinner we both ordered the NY Steak. Medium Rare for Me and Medium for my wife. I got the corn side dish and she had the asparagus.   The best part of our main course was the asparagus. $59 per steak? The $7.77 steak at Hard Rock  is far more superior than this over priced crap we were served. It was rubber and had no flavor. It was the hardest steak we've cut into. Our server asked how our meals were. I responded with, \"it's alright.\"  And that was the last time our server spoke to us until we asked for the check. We were clearly unsatisfied.  My specialty cocktail pushed to the side which was clearly full. Both our steaks barely eaten and pushed to the side. We asked for the check and he asked if we wanted to box it up. We said no. Not one question as to why we were unhappy with the meal.   Searsucker has failed with customer service and quality of dinner. Never again will we eat here. A kitchen nightmare. Thanks for ruining our lovely night.",

    "text": "I recently went to Vegas and Searsucker gave us the BEST meal! I still can't stop thinking about it.. drool. My friend and I split a few items: we started with the Field Greens & Pear Salad and added chicken, and it was almost like rotisserie chicken - super fresh and juicy. We also had the Shrimp Scampi (it comes with spaghetti squash) and Brussels & Walnuts. We felt like our items were super satisfying and generally healthy without being bland. Also not too overpriced compared to most places on the Strip! I'll be back! (*said in Arnold voice*)",

    "text": "The food is solid, and HH has some pretty good deals... but the service is terrrrrible- hit up HH 4:30-6PM for food and drinks at half price or less, but show up half an hour before you want anyone acknowledge you. No exaggeration. Oh, and then double check your receipt to be sure you were actually charged HH price instead of regular.   DUCK FAT FRIES + TOMATO JAM: All of my LA friends raved about duck fat fries like four years ago and I never tried them. These are some damn near perfect fries, but I was expecting some sort of distinct \"duck fat\" flavor and didn't really pick up on one. The tomato jam seems to just be a house-made ketchup with a bit of spice to it. STRAWBERRY + CHAMPAGNE + WALNUT + GOAT: It's a salad, fresh for summer. Instead of goat cheese crumbles or large circles, the cheese is served as a \"fondue\" on the plate. I found the sauce a little light on flavor and missed the texture it usually brings to a salad. \"COBB\" SALAD: Good portion, $6 for HH. Very fresh, lots of ingredients, cut to the proper size, and something I would get again even though it's far from a unique dish. TUNA + RADISH + TARO CHIPS + SPICE: The taro chips are huge and provide great texture. The poke itself was spicier than I expected but was exceptionally fresh. Not sure I'd get this again though.  EGGS + BACON \"PORK BELLY\": Cue the hallelujah choir! Perfectly poached egg, generous and thick cut of pork belly, drizzled with a delightful hollandaise with a slight sweetness to it, all atop a thin slice of toast. I'll wake up early every day if this is for breakfast! CRAB CAKE JUMBO LUMP + FENNEL + LEMON VERBENA AIOLI: Slightly salty but otherwise great! Made with very little filler, allowing the simple ingredients to shine. Server said this also had a Tabasco tobiko that I really enjoyed. Pretty pricey though at $17 regularly, a steal at $10 during HH. SHORT RIB \"HARLOT\" + HORSERADISH + FRIED ONION: It looked dry and didn't have much sauce, but was very tender and shredded easily. The fried onions and butter potatoes were simple but perfectly executed.  SWEET HEAT SQUID: Calamari in a sweet and sour sauce, with julienned apples. Fresh, good variety of textures, generous portion for HH. BF really enjoyed this. SHRIMP GRITS: Not a great version. Several shrimp, bland sauce, overcooked grits. This was a bit saucier than I liked and needed seasoning. Would not get this again, it's on the HH menu and I think it's priced appropriately there. MUSSELS: The broth was missing something, but was nicely fragrant with a large portion. The accompanying garlic bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Would get this again.  The food is pretty decent. Bar staff are friendly, but I have twice been assigned to a server who waited nearly a half hour to show up at my table, and nearly as long to bring the check. Given my two dismal service experiences during HH, it's not a place I'm willing to return for a full meal.",

Yep, toss that Fat Tuesday out! Its Vegas and for a pretty pricey-not so amazing- restaurant the \"no outside drink\" rule is obnoxious. Second and even worse, my beau got the FISH and CHIPS and GOT FOOD POISONING as a result! I think his meal was not only around $30-40 but then it made him very very sick. And he got sick to the point where we had to cut the rest of our Vegas plans short because he had to be treated for his food poisoning. And NO, HE DOESNT DRINK SO IT WAS NOT ANY REACTION TO ALCOHOL! Third, I was at a table with about 14 people and several people sent back their food because it was salty! No go with salty and over priced meals! Anyway, BYPASS this Cesars not so royal restaurant! METHINKS NOT EVER AGAIN!!!",

The biggest issue that we had was we had asked for the avocado on the side of our ahi tuna tacos because I am allergic to avocado but my wife isn't.  The bartender that took our order explained it was already on the side.  After my first bite into the taco I realized it was on the bottom of the taco as well.  Very disappointing. We also order the lollipop wings which were $9 on happy hour.  They had good flavor, but I don't think they were anything special.",

We wanted something a little different, and the selections and review pictures looked quite interesting. It was an early dinner by Vegas standard, around 7pm. Hostess was wonderfully friendly and promptly seated us.   The dinner started with an introduction from our server, Cesar.  He was really great from beginning to end.  We really enjoyed his friendliness and appreciated his attentive service. We wanted to have some fun during dinner, and Cesar played right along!  The entire service was great, perfectly timed and we were well attended the entire time.   We chose a few share plates; Tomato and Burata (super delish), short ribs (succulent and tasty), and the duck fat fries (nicely seasoned and presented).  For our main courses most had the hanger steak.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted great. One word of caution: You better love garlic, like I do!  One person in our party had the burger, which she said was \"amazing\", and another had the Salmon (perfectly cooked).  As if that wasn't enough, we finished off with the awesomely decadent ice cream sandwich. Man, the flavors there were unbelievable.   All in all, we each enjoyed the food and Cesar's excellent service.  We'd all recommend the place for a slightly different take on American classics.",

Happy hour old fashions from 5-7 we're legit. You get a nice selection of $9 old fashions and they were all good.....no skimping on the whiskey here.  Also for happy hour, they serve $2 dollar sliders, oysters and bone marrow.  Those selections alone could make a nice dinner.  But.....I also had a full meal....and it was delicious!  Small plates for dining was a great option for us.  Fried pig ears were awesome.  Octopus was awesome.  Short ribs was perfect.  Their poke starters were amazing...served on a fried seaweed chip.  The wings were a pleasant surprised as they were served in a unique way.  There were a few small plates that were ok but the variety we had made up for it.  The bar always had seating even during one of Vegas's busiest conventions. I'm giving this place 4 stars because I actually think I got my money's worth....and that says a lot when you're hanging out in Vegas.",

I love the off white colors mixed with the accents of wood.  It was very relaxing yet vibrant- a perfect way to describe the food & the ambience.  Just go ahead and order the Jalaberry Strawpeno - You're welcome.   - If you love Calamari- you are required to try there Calamari Steaks. It will take you down a flavor road that you never knew existed.    - Lollipop wings are always a great idea at ANY of the Hakkasan Group restaurants.   - MAC & CHEESE - HOLY LORD ALMIGHTY........Just do it.   - Beer Braised Short Ribs so light and cooked to perfection.  The flavors on the short ribs will make you come back for more.   Thanks to the Searsucker staff for always doing a great job & answering all the recommendations. We will be back!",

We then topped our meal off with some dessert we had there a banana split which had brownies chocolate ganache a caramelized banana and peanut butter and vanilla and chocolate ice cream which was heaven!! We also had their cookies which came with milk for dunking which I thought was really cute.

What a disappointment; service was below average waiter acted bothered and had attitude when asking questions; ordered the 145 dollar tomahawk that's was not seasoned and they had it sliced into strips and off the bone. Also it looked substantially  smaller than normal and no juice( ordered many times at del mar location) Not to mention the sides came 5 minutes after steak did and rest of dinner came in 5-10 after the steak arrived. About 30/40 minutes for a unseasoned and dry steak. Tomato soup was not hot; somewhere between cold and warm and bacon and egg dish was soggy. Major disappointment for owner who has top chef status. Oh let's not mention my old fashion was half maybe 3/4 filled. Lastly the bell hoy was in our face ever minute to collect dishes and took leftover chicken before I can take home. I spend 350 and waiter took time to add top of 20%. Major disappointment after putting a lot of talk into the dinner leading up to the dinner. Everyone left disappointed.   Update- management did reach out and was very professional and response. For this I raise you a star.",

We had the short ribs (to die for!), mushrooms on toast and drinks. The waiter very sweetly brought us a dessert on the house because of missing happy hour - it was delightful, as thoughtful things always are!  Went back the next night for happy hour, and tried to eat them out of house and home. Duck fat fries were outstanding, more short ribs, cheese puffs, a couple of salads, shrimp and grits - everything was on point and delicious, plus bargain priced. Don't miss it!",

I love my cheese, so this was off to a great start! She suggested that we try the 'Eggs & Bacon' which is a slice of brioche topped with the most succulent pork belly with a poached eggs glazed in hollandaise sauce. It was a life changing experience! MUST HAVE! We also had the bone marrow which was one of the best I've ever tried followed by the beef tartare. Can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can go to this restaurant again!",

We went during happy hour on Wednesday. We sat and waited for a server. We ended up going to the bar for menus where the bartender said our server would be with us shortly. After waiting 15 minutes we ended up ordering at the bar. The place wasn't busy. In fact, I saw a couple employees standing at the bar. When our food came out it was delivered by someone who worked in the kitchen, we had to ask him for silverware and plates. Nobody ever checked in on us and we ended up going to the bar again to ask for our check. This place was one of my favorite stops when I visited and has become the only bad experience on my vacation. :(",

For food we ordered the duck fat fries, short ribs, and my favorite item, egg + bacon!! It was sweet and salty, delicious. And then the cheddar puffers! Wow. Desserts were also on point.

    "text": "This is a solid new restaurant.  The bar tenders are really nice.  Of course I stopped here during restaurant week and the menu was great.  For $40 I started with one of the most beautiful salads I had even eaten.  It had a puddle of what could only be described as goat cheese loveliness spread on the bottom of my plate.  Then there was a generous topping of assorted lettuces, plus lots of strawberries topped with balsamic.  It was so nice.  I then had the flat iron steak which was real decent, but the star of that was the chimmichuri.  I may not have spelled that correctly, but you know what I mean.  The end of the meal was AMAZING as I had the cookies and milk.  So delicious.  There were three cookies and they were chocolately amazingness with just a quick sprinkle of sea salt on top.  I have decided that if I ever make chocolate chip cookies, I am sprinkling sea salt on top.  Now, mind you, I already do this with my peanut butter cookies, but who knew salt would be equally delicious on chocolate chip cookies??  A quick note, I find the dining area to be EXCEEDINGLY loud as there are bare floors and lots of people squished into a small spot.  The music was awesome though, even if it added to it's loudness ;)",

We had a 7:00 reservation and although the place was packed when we arrived we were seated right away at a really cozy table at the back of the restaurant.  Our server was really helpful and made some great recommendations.  We started with the warm spinach salad, which was absolutely delicious.  The hubby had the swordfish with a side of Cauliflower and I had the shrimp with a side of corn.  Everything that came out was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  My husband said it was the best fish he's ever had. Only regret is that we totally cleaned our plates and didn't have room to try any of the desserts.  Overall the experience was really great.  Good service without being pretentious, good drinks, and excellent food.  Will definitely come back next time we're in town.",

    "text": "Walk. Don't walk. That's the sign at the entrance. Much like a pedestrian crossing light. This place must be fun! The hostesses were welcoming and promptly offered an invite into the restaurant. Once my friend arrived we were shown inside by the lovely Stephanie who showed us the bar and the kitchen area, as well as our \"people watching seats\". It's nice to see the kitchen operation in action. Everything the chefs were working on looked fresh.  Desiree was our server. She came to us right away to welcome us and brought the Happy Hour menus. We had about 15 minutes before their Happy Hour was over so we promptly ordered four cocktails and 2 appetizers. The cocktails were crafty and delicious. The fuck dat fries, sorry the Duck Fat Fries with chipotle ketchup had just the right combination of flavors, they were pulpy, fresh and crispy, not too spicy (thank goodness for me!). I couldn't taste the duck but they were delish nonetheless . The short rib \"the harlot\" though was soooo freaking good! It was tender and juicy and the mashed potatoes and the crispy onions OMG I could eat like 3 or 4 or 5 of those orders! Yumm! We followed with the strawberry walnut goat cheese salad, Wow great combination of textures, with fruit and crunchiness and fresh greens. Then the Tuna albacore wrapped in prosciutto, sherry alioli and balsamic balls (gooey balls, yumm!) with a delicious Frisee salad, barely seared but definitely rear tuna (sashimi grade for sure!) was sooooooo good! The tuna just melts in your mouth! By then I was starting to feel full but I couldn't stop eating it. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the chocolate chip cookies looked finger licking good. Desiree was super friendly and informative and kept us entertained in between dishes. She made some excellent recommendations. You could tell she enjoys talking about the different menu items and how much she loved trying them all during pre-opening. If you are lucky enough to get Desiree during your visit, you will be a pampered guest! Her assistant Ahi (Aji?) (I called him Ajilipollas) was friendly and always kept our water glasses topped. I can't wait to visit Searsucker again so I can try the other items I wish I could've eaten today. I'm no terminator but \"I'll be back!\".",

The ahi tacos, steak tartar were good. I wouldn't write home about the entrees, steak, chicken, and fish. Those were alright, not great. The Stars were definitely the more appetizer style dishes. I would come back if prompted.",

One of the Cocktail server assistants told me about it while we were in Omnia. It had to have been around 3:30am or so. Pretty awesome how the place stays open late when the club is going on. We hurried up and ordered the chicken & waffles as we heard they were amazing! Service staff is on point! Our server Steve was highly knowledgeable about the food and also vouched for the said Chicken & waffles. They were indeed worthy of the hype surrounding them, haha! Food was brought out quick! Matt (food runner guy) asked if we needed anything and made sure we got al we needed to devour the luscious food (I said luscious). I would highly recommend coming here again and we probably will come by during normal dinner time as well. Food was awesome as well as the service. Now you guys know where to head after going to OMNIA!!! Ha!   (Sorry no pics, I lost my phone before the night ended)",

She had long blonde hair and her name was Nikki.  When we requested a table she stated the restaurant wasn't opening until 4minutes. Two parties right after us was seated immediately. All the Caesar affiliated restaurants cater to diamond players and even let you skip the line. It's such a pity that this hostess didn't have any manners regardless of what customers we were.   In addition, the waitress asked the manager to come speak to us but that was non existent.  On side note our waitress Tammie",

    "text": "We stopped here for a quick dinner while staying at Caesars and didn't really have set expectations for the food because the over the years various grab and go snack or burger joints have moved in and out of this space, but we were honestly pleasantly surprised by our experience.   The location is kind of tucked away so unless people are gambling in that area or do some research I feel like they probably aren't even aware that it is there. The interior has cool decor and lighting. The atmosphere is modern and inviting. And the vibe is come as you are and come hungry.  I did love that they had a Yelp check-in offer. I just started using Yelp a few months ago so I am always very excited when I find a new place that provides an offer with check-in and theirs did not disappoint! They brought me an entire bowl of Habanero and Coriander soaked pickles and as a pickle lover I was very pleased!   We decided to order multiple dishes and share them at the table.  Below is a breakdown of what we ordered:  -Biscuits with whipped butter and infused honey *Literally do not leave here without eating these and make sure to smother them in honey. SO good.  -Tomato and burrata in a mason jar *kind of a twist on caprese salad or bruschetta - very \"instagramable\" presentation and delicious.  -Field greens and pear salad with champagne vinegar goat cheese and candied walnuts *loved this salad and everything in it -- definitely recommend.  -Shrimp Scampi with spaghetti squash, garlic, and lemon *my mom and sister really enjoyed this. I am not a huge spaghetti squash fan so it wasn't my favorite.  -Slider trio with bacon, cheddar, chipotle, and crispy onions.  *my mom and sister are a little bit pickier when it comes to sauces and toppings so I was willing to eat the sliders sans chipotle and onions, but the staff were so accommodating that they brought the plate of 3 customized to our liking (1 with everything and 2 without). These were awesome so I can only imagine how delicious the full size burgers are!  Overall I would strongly recommend Searsucker as a break from the steakhouses and reservation only restaurants. The food is great, the service is awesome, and the environment is casual and relaxing. Don't forget to check in when you arrive!",

We enjoyed sharing several offerings starting with the Blackened Ahi Tacos- small but packed with flavor. Next was the Calamari Steak with Chili Honey Glaze and Apples- strongly recommended by our server-- thank goodness. This is NOT typical fried Calamari O's you could get at any ordinary chain place. No no no!! Think more of the difference in canned tuna and real fresh Ahi= yes now you get it! The Calamari Steak will change your life-- or at least your expectations of seafood for bit. Lastly we shared The Braised Pork Butt Entree- a tower of flavor power! So melt in your mouth type tender. Whiskey Apples, Brussels Sprouts and Prosciutto round out the experience.  Also worth mention is the wide variety of hand crafted cocktails- especially the Jaleberry Strawpeno-- tequila with fruit and heat.",

    "text": "There are a lot of restaurants in Caesar's Palace and I ate at three of them. This was  the most expensive of the three. It was so expensive I ordered the hamburger. While the hamburger was good and also a good size, it was $25.   The bar served their mixed drinks in very warm glasses filled with large cubes so they put only a small amount of alcohol in them and just let them get watered down by the heat of the glass. That was disappointing. Ordered a bottle of wine and they brought out a different year stating they did not have the year represented on the menu. Not a big deal unless you were only willing to pay that high of a price and ordered a specific bottle and vintage off the menu because you knew it was a good year for that wine and also knew the bookend years were not as good...as was the case here. We did get an apology from the manager stating they'd intended to update the menu but hadn't yet done so. We sent the wine back before they'd opened it.   The staff was friendly and my dinner guests seemed to enjoy themselves. They were kind enough not order the $145 cowboy steak - for obvious reasons.",

We were greeted by a warm and welcoming server who explained some of the dishes, cocktails and what she recommended.   We started with a few cocktails including the Peter Rabbit and Bad Bad T-Roy Brown. I loved the Rabbit... I added the gin to it and it made for an easy to drink refreshing cocktail that was a little sweeter so the alcohol didn't overwhelm you. Definitely a hit.  As for the food, we ordered the kale and romaine caesar, potato fries, JP's chicken wings, jalapeno-chorizo corn, brussels & walnuts and eggs and bacon.   My favorites were the potato fries, corn and brussels. The fries were so delicious fried in duck fat! They were crunchy, salty and had more flavor then a regular french fry because of the oil. The chipotle ketchup they are served with was also good fit and we asked for an extra serving of it. The brussel sprouts were roasted with a nice char on them and were tossed in lemon and walnuts. I loved the extra crunch from the walnuts and the tangy zest from the lemon. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. I felt the same about the corn, spicy and sweet. It's a dish I wouldn't normally order but I am glad we did.   We also had the pb & J dessert and chocolate s'more dessert. I think they were both hits but the preferred the s'mores.   We had great service, the dishes all came out in a timely manner one or two at a time which I appreciated so we could take our time and our table wasn't packed to the brim with dishes. Thanks for the experience Searsucker!",

She knew the whole menu, and she never missed a beat with our group.  Drinks: When Doves Cry - Two thumbs up Snake in the Grass - meh. Too sweet, it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it. We had a taste of a syrah that was just terrible. Maybe it had been open too long, or maybe the wine was just that bad.  We had more cocktails and quite a few wines, but I don't remember enough about them to post anything.  Food: Braised Pork Butt - Tasty, more than enough food by itself! Scallops - Great, definitely worth ordering Bigeye Tuna - Very good, though it could have used a little more flavor to kick it up a notch Tacos - looked good but were itty bitty. Some of the smallest tacos I have ever seen. The warm spinach salad looked a little on the small side too. Though spinach really shrinks up with heat so maybe that is why.  Also, for those wondering...the things listed under 'Jars and Sliced' literally come in a jar. Not great if you are sharing, but fun if it is just for you.  Overall, a great option for dinner close to the strip!",

My friends and I arrived at around 5:30pm and sat in the bar area (which had plenty of empty seating, a plus). We were quickly approached by an unenthused waiter who put off blaring vibes of, \"you're not going to tip much so I'm not going to waste my time.\" We ordered our drinks and they were definitely heavy poured but over priced even for happy hour. The food, however, was pretty good. I ordered the sliders and really enjoyed the sriracha mayo that came with it while my friends ordered the ahi tuna tacos and buffalo chicken pops (FYI, they don't have ranch)  Overall it was a bland experience and bland service (and an awkward \"is everything ok here??\" by the manager). Their regular menu looked interesting and I'd bet if I returned for an actual meal I would receive better service, but I probably wont return unless someone else was so inclined.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to write this review sooner but am just getting around to it now. I was with a large group of people in attendance at the CinemaCon  convention for NATO(The National Association of Theater Owners) in Las Vegas this past April. We attended many events where we were served outstanding meals but also elected to dine at several restaurants on The Strip. Someone had recommended Searsucker so a group of about 15 people made reservations and went there for dinner. The service started out OK,but none of the waitstaff were particularly friendly nor attentive. The food was good but there were several mix-ups in our order and we were certain at one point that they brought us more plates of appetizers than we actually ordered.We ended up leaving much food behind. The final frustration for me was that a couple of us had asked for sparking water and a large bottle of Voss sparkling water was brought to the table. We finished that one and asked for another. This time a bottle(same bottle?) was brought back to the table uncapped, but we only drank a small amount. When we asked to take the remainder of the bottle with us the waitstaff first told us that they had thrown out the cap and we could have it poured in plastic cups(?). When I suggested they open another bottle that they were going to serve already opened(as they did ours)and give us THAT cap they insisted they would be unable to do that. Finally one of the waitstaff came back and told us they had miraculously \"found\" a cap so we could take the bottle but seemed very annoyed with us at this point and made little effort to conceal their annoyance from us,their patrons. We spent several hundred dollars on our meals and drinks and also tipped far better than the service we received warranted . Considering the many dining options in Las Vegas on the strip I would NEVER go to Searsucker again specifically because of the rudeness and unprofessionalism of their staff.",

We will be trying the restaurants near home for sure too.    The service was solid but we also were there during Happy Hour so it was a slight slow at times but over all very solid.  We went during Happy Hour and got a collection to share at the table to try several different options.  Hummus - very flavorful and the bread was delicious alone but the hummus added to It.  Potato fries - anything fried in duck fat is going to be amazing and this did not disappoint.  The prosciutto dust added to the flavor.  Slider - perfectly cooked and had a nice spicy to them.  Tuna taco - fresh and flavorful",

My only criticism is it's a little, fancy & expensive considering it's the proximity  to one of the biggest sportsbooks in Vegas. Also they only had appetizers & salads available when I went there. I was told the main course menu was still under construction. If this type of menu was presented in an upper floor cocktail lounge it would be more fitting. I wish them luck & offer a suggestion. Due to it's location, having some kind of food or drink promotions for larger sporting events \"March madness\" for example could make this spot a must stop when in Ceaser's!",

    "text": "When you walk in the front of Caesars, head right, towards the sports book, and this isn't too far away from the front on the right. It's across from Alto Bar.   I arrived at 6:15 on a Sunday and although it seemed busy, I was easily able to get a seat at the bar. I was greeted and given a menu right away. There isn't much for food on the happy hour menu, but more cocktails than I expected based on a menu I saw online. I ordered and quickly got my drink. It took them a little longer to take my food order, but not too bad. No one asked me how my drink was though.   I went with the burger. They said everything is homemade with it and they only make 20 per day. I asked if anything came with it and they said bun, ketchup, etc. I asked if I could add fries and they said it came with it. Ummm...that's what I was getting at when I asked if anything came with it.   The burger was really good. The pickles that came with it were too spicy for me. They didn't bring ketchup with the fries but the bartender got it for me.   The service was okay, but not that friendly. I wasn't asked if I wanted another drink so I stopped with just one when I would've had two. Someone next to me said that the bartender seemed grumpy. This would've been a 4 Star for me with friendlier, more attentive service.",

Only catch is that you'll need to spend a minimum of $55/person, but on the plus side you get three bottles of wine. However, that was the deal my party of 9 got.   Ordered the filet mignon which was double seared and on a bed of sauteed kale. It was delicious in my book, the chef did well on making it medium rare for me.   I don't recommend ordering the roasted cauliflower. My friend ordered some to meet our $55 quota, however we barely ate it. The seasonings were off and tasted sour, which could have been the pickled chilis.   If you come here to get a special deal to get into the club, just order a main dish and a couple drinks.",

Not super deep fried and it was like octopus big.  -The biscuit- holy tamole! Buttery honey warm perfection. Came with 3 and I seriously will not share next time.  -shrimp melon salad. Definition of summer salad. Colorful fresh and tasty.   I tried bone marrow for the first time. Actually enjoyed it. They had fog jam and Brussel sprout chip garnish to compliment. I liked it but still have not a bone marrow convert being a regular order yet. I think if your a fan it's well done here with presentation and taste.  Also has pig ears. Very very tasty. I was thinking chicharron but it was softer easy to chewy, does not look gross, and you can eat it like bacon.   Entrees to recommend: -Ribeye. Already sliced and easy to share. Classic char style. Gotta be okay with the ever so good but bad fatty parts -scallops. On top of my favorite two things, mushroom and corn. Simple preparation but hit the spot  Desserts were more on the comfort side. Cookie was nice and classic. I'm a fruity cream based dessert person so I would say dessert not the strongest points for me here. It's ok though... I would have that biscuit for dessert though.   Yes would go back and already have. Service solid a just a good fun time.",

However, by the time we were seated with food in front of us, we could have just waited in the buffet line and gotten our tables at the buffet.   I ordered the Tuna Poke. I liked the tuna poke. The portion was significant enough to be eaten as an entree for a small adult for doesn't eat a lot. I also ordered a lovely rose wine that I thought was fairly priced at $11/glass.   Please note that this location sells itself like an upscale bar. This means that during football season, the games are annoyingly playing in the background. I don't recall noise emitting from the games, but having the games on definitely scaled down the restaurant--especially at the price point.   I would probably not go back but it's not because of the staff's fault or anything. They were fine and the food was good. 4-stars for the confusing combination of sports bar and upscale Vegas dining.",

We reviewed the menu online and OH MY so many good things!  We chose to go with shareables as we were headed to the Absinthe show after dinner and on a bit of a time crunch.  I chose the Tomato Soup with grilled cheese just for me - and it was the most delicious tomato soup of my life!  Super velvety and indulgent.  Loved!  Hubby went for the Crispy Ear which was pig ear served in a little to go box with micro green salad on top.  He enjoyed it, although he was kind of hoping for more of a pork rind than a pig ear.  We split the Toast with Fig and Honey, which was an excellent bite!  You get one thick slice of toast which was the perfect amount to share.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  Simple and delicious!  Then we split the Hummus.  It was served with super soft pita and sprinkled with zatar spice.  Loved it!  This was an absolute gem of a restaurant!  Atmosphere was wonderful, service was excellent, menu was to-die-for.  Hubby and I will definitely go back one day to try more things.",

Fast forward to today, I find out,  there is Happy Hour @ Seersucker, only on non game days!  I called to confirm.      So here we were @ Seersucker, we were able to sit @ the bar!  The positive side,  we could people watch, eat off the full menu & the Happy Hour menu!  We ended up ordering  The Bone Marrow, the short rib & one of the limited 20 burgers per day!  The bone marrow was spot on, served with what I think was fried type of lettuce, & bread.   The bone marrow was seasoned just right.   Now on to the delectable burger, which was ordered medium rare.  Unfortunately words can't describe how delightful the taste was.  I'm not much into bacon on burgers,  however the bacon jam was perfected. Gouda cheese was melted just perfectly.   Bread so fresh! The burger was the spouses meal.  The French fries with the burger were seasoned & crispy.  I had the short rib.  The short rib the meat was so tender you did not need the knife.  The mash potatoes was omg so creamy just melted with the meat flavors. The honest truth. I would probably order the burger next time, & skip the rib.    Oh sheesh. Almost forgot.  The happy hour margaritas were absolutely smooth, not too tart or sweet!   We ended ordering 5 margaritas.    So yes, people, this place is a m",

For appetizers we had chicken wings, calamari (my favorite dish of the night), duck fat fries, and buratta. I ordered scallops for my main course.

Lots of varieties of Old Fashioneds were tasty.   The food was hit or miss.   Things I ate: Pork chop special - perfectly cooked, assertively spiced, good sides. Tomato & Burrata appetizer - good if not special Brussels - delicious Mac & cheese - We got this for the table to share. First of all, this was huge. More importantly, it was SO salty that our table of 6 couldn't actually finish it.  Things I didn't eat, but witnessed eaten all by the same coworker, \"F\": Caesar salad - My coworker loves caesar salads. Seriously, she's a bit nutty about it. She will eat them multiple times/day. She was so disappointed in their caesar that she sent it back after a few bites.  Oysters - After returning the salad, she ordered 4 oysters, 2 each east and west. I'm not sure what she thought of the flavor, but she was very clear that she was annoyed that they were shucked poorly. Still connected to the shell, and then lots of little shell pieces that she had to pull off her tongue. She was too frustrated at this point to bother sending them back.   Filet - She thought this was so salty that she only ate half of it.  Overall, we had a good experience, but if you asked F, she'd probably rate this place a 1-2 star. Personally I'd be willing to go back, but it wasn't so great that it's going to be high on my list when you consider all the other options.",

We were not disappointed!  The restaurant is located inside Caesar's Palace and has a cool ambiance. For starters, we had the burrata with tomato, duck fat fries with prosciutto, bone marrow, calamari, and octopus. It was all amazingly good! The burrata/tomato, duck fat fries, and bone marrow were probably my 3 favs, with the marrow as my number 1. It was actually my first time having bone marrow and it had some type of sweet fig spread or something on the top. It was amazing and my next marrow is going to have to try real hard to live up!  For my main course, I had the Salmon with canneli bean ragu, pancetta, and pesto. The salmon was really good, cooked to a perfect medium. The flavors of the beans, pesto, and pancetta were perfectly complimentary. My colleagues ordered various steaks as well as the Brick Chicken and they all really enjoyed theirs as well. In addition to really good food, they also have a nice drink menu with some seriously delicious cocktail choices!  Don't pass up Searsucker for a truly delicious Las Vegas meal!",

I ended up ordering a beer marinated flank steak and it was delectable, The steak had a sweet beer flavor yet was still savory. The table ordered two macaroni and cheese sides and both were enough to feed ten people! The mac and cheese was probably the highlight of the meal for everyone.   Others got steak, burgers, and fish and everyone agreed it was delicious. The ambiance is really good as well.

To start, my food showed up an hour and a half after I ordered it and I ordered it medium rare, it came out rarer than rare...it was literally cold in the middle. The only redeeming quality of this place was the bartender, she was very accommodating and comped 2 beers.   For those of you like me, traveling for work and looking for a place to get a quick bite, steer clearing this place. Do it for your own good and mine....viva Las Vegas!!",

For my cocktail I chose the Jalaberry Strawpeno - which is a strawberry jalapeno tequila + lime + agave. This was a great mix of spicy and sweet! For appetizers we shared the cheddar puffers, mussels + chorizo + beer, brie \"triple\" + cranberry jam, \"cowboy caviar\" and the shrimp \"spicy\" + bacon grits.  I have to say that my favorites were the mussels and the shrimp with the grits! YUMM! For my entree I chose the scallops \"east coast\" israeli couscous + almonds + citrus vinaigrette- this was fabulous! We then shared a variety of desserts- I have to say my favorite was the warm cookies with milk.  I absolutely enjoyed the entire experience at Searsucker! Will definitely be back!",

What I got was around 6 ounces of meat, about 2 ounces of which was all fat.  I told the bartender who brought it to the chefs  attention that it seemed real small.  He offered to take it back to the kitchen to ask the chef.  He then came back and told me it was correct and the steaks were partitioned properly.  I'm not sure what that meant.  I ended up eating the steak.  The meat was seasoned properly but it was definitely tougher than what you would get at a high end steakhouse that serves prime steaks.  I also asked for a side of chimichuri sauce with my steak.  That actually ended up being very good.  I also got a side of the Brussels sprouts.  Those were very tart.  As for the service, it was very good.  Unfortunately I felt very dissatisfied after.  I would not recommend going to this restaurant.",

They have changed chefs from our Meet up, and have also adjusted the menu, taking away my favorite Pork Belly Benedict which I send people here to try. Also gone, my Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. This makes me sad. :(  I had the eggs and bacon, and also the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. The eggs and bacon was disappointing, the pork belly here was so dry and crunchy that it was almost inedible. The grilled cheese and tomato basil was pretty good.   This is one of my pet peeves with restaurants, and that's taking good items off the menu. I'm sure there are numbers that say this wasn't selling or whatever. Looking over this menu, I really didn't see much that I enjoyed from our Yelp event left. I was definitely disappointed with the selections.   Alas, I won't be back nor recommending it again. I'm sure people will still enjoy what they have to offer, and they have a great location. Time to find a new Strip restaurant to enjoy and take guests from out of town to.",

    "text": "Adventurous comfort food.  Is that an oxymoron?  Well, go to Searsucker and decide for yourself.  My advice, though, would be to take a good look at the menu first.  You will either spot some unusual dishes that you are dying to try, or (like me) you will decide this just doesn't look like my cup of tea.  I went here only because I was with a group that was staying at Caesar's and chose this restaurant.  I was looking for something less adventurous than the crispy pig's ears and such.  I might have ordered a burger, but the menu trumpets that they only make 20 of them per night.  How pretentious!  You might get one, or not.  I prefer to do my gambling in the casino, so I ordered tomato soup, a Cobb salad, and also split a mac & cheese and an order of cornbread with my wife.  The soup was okay; nothing special.  The Cobb salad wasn't.  I mean it wasn't a Cobb salad.  Greens and bacon mostly, with a vinaigrette dressing - closer to a Spinach salad.  The mac & cheese was very rich and quite good; I guess it's hard to mess up that dish unless you load it up with truffles, which (thank God) they didn't.  The cornbread really should have been the complementary bread plate, but if they insist on charging five bucks for it - well, that's how it goes.  My wife did like her brick chicken.  Seersucker tries to brand itself as a comfortable party place.  I didn't see it that way.  It had a weird ambiance, with giant fish skeletons and pictures of roosters on the walls.  The bar area was not comfortable, and the bar service was slow.  I'm not going to comment on the dining room service because, as I said, we were with a group and it is entirely possible that someone in the group was slowing things down with a lot of questions and dithering.  However, the place did seem to be understaffed.  Well, at least the prices were reasonable (by Caesar's Palace standards).",

Right amount of sauce, some type of fruit or currant(I don't recall) but great! The Pork Butt, OMG,so good and cooked perfectly. It was a whole meal, there were a few pieces of greens on the plate. My daughter, a 14 year old princess had the $40.00 filet, and she would not give me any! She is a steak conisure and she orders medium and she said it was cooked perfectly. I think she has a picture I will upload. The only downside,it was a lacarte, we didn't eat the sides much, the water at $9, was overpriced so we spent way too much. I think the prices are a little steep but if you hVe the money...go and enjoy!  I almost forgot...the service is great! The Server was really knowledgeble and they are quick to refill and take dirty plates away. Service was top notch!",

We were seated promptly.  The menu was very inviting and our server (who did not share her name with us) was very pleasant. She was very good throughout the meal - attentive, but not obtrusive, talkative, but not overly chatty. If I were offering a rating based solely on her service, it would have received a six.  We ordered drinks to start. I got the fizzy lifter and my wife got the blackberry smash. Both were very, very good with plenty of alcohol. In fact, we later ordered a couple more. The server readily provided us with a detailed description of how to make the fizzy lifter when we requested.  Our first appetizer was an order of shisheido peppers. Cooked perfectly, but a little salty. The ponzu sauce was a fantastic addition (its flavor made the small chunks of salt sprinkled on top unnecessary, in my opinion).  Our second appetizer was the short rib. Succulent and cooked perfectly, it was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a wonderful gravy. This was the best part of our meal.  We split the hanger steak for a main course (we planned in advance for dessert). It was delicious! It was served on small potatoes and mushrooms with an appropriately sized drizzle of a chimichurri sauce that was (1) very good (me), or (2) ok (my wife). Overall, a fine selection to split.  We ordered the ice cream sandwich and the ice cream selection for dessert. While the ice creams were delicious (chocolate, salted caramel and cappuccino), the ice cream sandwich was the star. This is a must if you are a dessert person. Served on caramel and accompanied by a large dollop of fresh whipped cream, I was left attempting to lick the plate.  The decor was tasteful, but it was a little loud, being next to the casino. Overall, a very good place to pop in for a dinner.  We did not experience many of the negative things mentioned by other reviewers. If you go the Searsucker, I hope your experience equals ours.",

    "text": "Wasn't horribly impressed. The menu is not cohesive enough to give the kitchen any rythym to service, hence, there are huge swings in quality of the food. The duck fat fries were so ovely seasoned it was obscuring the pancetta and the unctuousness of the duck fat. The chicken was under seasoned and dry, traded that out for a mid rare filet that was totally bloody... but we ate it anyway since the demi glace was plentiful and delicious. It was very loud too, too much of everything to be wonderful at anything. You blew it on this one Brian! Chef Jill",

The happy hour is actually decent deals for a couple of great items from the menu.  Chicken Slider with crispy chicken topped coleslaw and blue cheese crumbs compliments each other well.    The speciality $9 drinks are heavy on the liquor but high on taste.  The vibe is low key with great tv screens at the bar.    Check them out",

The hostesses were quick to get us seated near the open kitchen where we could easily watch the plates coming out. Tyler was our server who was attentive, knowledgeable, and perfect on timing our different courses. Bussers were on top of clearing our plates and resetting us with new silverware, and our glasses were always full.   The dishes themselves were amazing. We started with the tostada ceviche and bone marrow: both delightful. I am normally not an octopus fan, but it was diced small enough and meshed very well with the fresh ingredients. Next we had the field greens salad and tomato soup. The field greens was a little too sweet for me, but I also took out the goat cheese which would've helped to cut the sweetness. My boyfriend said that he had never had a tomato soup better! Props to the kitchen. Lastly, we had the flat iron, cooked to perfection with the chimichurri, and the scallops.   We ended with the cookies and milk and cheesecake. Both delicious and rich in flavor! My only gripe was that there was no milk alternative since I am sensitive to dairy, but I sucked it up and dipped my cookies in the milk anyways because they were so good! Thank you Searsucker team for a great meal, awesome presentation of dishes, and great service.",

Crusted Ahi Tuna (5/5)- It came with a few thick slices, paired with a very delicious sauce and some greens.  Oysters (2/5)- I'm an oyster lover so of course I had to try it. I wasn't a fan of how it was prepared. I think because I'm more of a ponzu with my oyster type of person.  Bone marrow (3/5) - I love bone marrow but I didn't like the jelly and bone marrow combination.  Main entrees: *Prime New York (5/5) - very tender and juicy cut with a very delicious truffle butter!!! Yumm  *Scallops (3/5) - it was cooked perfectly but nothing super special about it *Cowboy ribeye (1/5) - very nice cut of steak but LACKED A LOT OF FLAVOR!! Wasn't worth $100 if you asked me.   My overall experience was ok. Our server was really great at first, he would check in to see how we're doing, etc. but when we got our appetizers he was no where to be found. It was hard just to get another drink refilled. I'm kinda upset bc I really enjoyed this place when I first sat down but left unhappy due to the lack of customer service from our server. I'm happy I got to try this place once but I won't be coming back again.",

A few people at our table gravitated toward the burger ($24 - Vegas prices). (The menu claims that only 20 are made each day.) It was a very good burger, and it's one of the cheaper items on the menu. So if you're looking for red meat, you're golden.  I had to dock a star because it was incredibly complicated to get our bills split. I appreciate that keeping track of 8 bills can be challenging, but our waiter kept coming back to the table multiple times with only some people's checks and then having to go back and correct more mistakes. I certainly want to get the appropriate bill, but make sure you can correct your problems before bringing all the checks to the table.   Definitely on the loud side. Great people watching.",

    "text": "Quietly surpassing four years serving Las Vegas in March, a 2018 transfer from Brian Malarkey to Hakkasan Group leaving the space mostly unchanged save for some menu adjustments, it was Sunday evening that Searsucker was found busy mere moments after opening.   Themed as a place to \"Come Early, Stay Late,\" its location inside Caesars' Palace just steps from Omnia originally intended to catch club-goers both coming and going, modern times instead have seen the Restaurant serving \"New American Classics\" take a more serious turn, the Drinks less frou-frou and Food more focused on Meats, Sides and Salads.  Popular for both Sports fans and guests pre-revelry, a plethora of televisions on this night showing NBA Playoff action in an environment far more welcoming than Caesars' Sports Book, it was after greetings at the hostess stand that two diners were led to a table near the kitchen, service proving competent yet rushed over the course of two hours.  Still bearing all the original design elements, even a hallway of relics selected by Malarkey en route to the restroom identical from a visit one month after opening, it was on-request that the 5:00p-7:00p menu typically offered at Searsucker's Bar was presented, Dinner starting off with Pig Skins only available during Happy Hour at approximately $1 each with a thick yet crispy consistency and bold spicing with or without Chef's Vinegar.  Moving next to a pair of Buffalo Chicken Sliders offered at $4 a piece, these too only available early at a counter which was already two-deep, both spicy Sandwiches were fine but largely inconsequential in comparison to housemade Pickles or bargain-priced Bone Marrow with accompanying Toast for spreading  and dazzling Chili Glaze.  Unapologetically targeting a wide audience, Raw Plates including $4 Oysters (that are half-off early) passed over in favor of fragrant housemade Hummus, suffice it to say that Searsucker continues to impress with off-cuts in the form of sliced Pig's Ears tinged in Citrus while the limited-edition Burger is worth every penny of its $24 tab thanks to a rich grind topped with plenty of smoked Cheese, mashed Avocado and Bacon Jam.  Equally happy with hand-cut Potatoes double-fried in Duck Fat, the housemade Bun also not lacking in effort or excellence, those seeking something sharable will be happy to know that in addition to Steaks ranging 8oz to two-pounds there is Lobster, Chicken and hand-made Strozzapreti served beneath a generous amount of Wild Boar Ragu.  Scaling back Sweets from day one, only four choices including Ice Cream and Cheesecake currently offered, it is fortunate that what is served ranks amongst the best city-wide in its genre - Bread Pudding made from Croissants steamy and rich beneath Burning Marshmallows while four Chocolate Chip Cookies served warm are bound to make a mess that most will be happy to lick off their fingers.",

It was good very meaty and not rubbery at like some calamari. Had good flavor we enjoyed it just a little different. Wife had the filet which she though was cooked well and tasted good. I had the drunken flat iron. It had more of a sweet flavor which I am not a fan of but it wasn't overpowering to where I couldn't eat it. It. came with fingerling potato's. Overall a solid meal we would try this place again if in this hotel. We came for a concert. The people beside us got the lobster and it looked amazing we would probably do that's if we come again !",

    "text": "I really debated between giving this place 3 stars or 4 stars, but landed on 4 stars because of my friends dish that I tried so... there's hope yet!  I went here with a couple of coworkers while we attended CES and we ordered a side of Parmesan fries, calamari, and then our mains (I got the strip steak). The fries were decent - a good taste to them, albeit the seasoning was a bit heavy. The calamari.. was a bit letdown. Image the taste of calamari if it was done sweet and sour style at Panda Express. The calamari was cut into... think potatoes wedge style, and covered in sweet and sour spicy sauce. Literally if I closed my eyes I would've imagined sweet and sour from Panda... although it wasn't deep fried. A bit of a letdown when you think of calamari.  The main dish, the skirt steak was fine, but nothing to write home about. Plate had a fair bit of excess oil dripping around.  However! And this is the saving grace. They have a burger on their menu that my coworker tried that was excellent. They only make 20 of these per day (per meal?) and it was excellent. Smoked Gouda cheese, grilled onions, and a patty that they make in-house. Springy buns and all - the bite I tried was delicious and made me pretty envious of my coworker who got it :) so, I'll give this place a second chance - I'm sure the menu has some other gems like that!",

    "text": "We came here for happy hour because my husband had been wanting to for a while. The good news is that happy hour is 5-7 every day, the bad news is it's a very limited menu, especially if you don't drink.  There are only 3 options for happy hour entrees - oysters, sliders, and bone marrow. We didn't get the sliders since they seemed pretty standard. My husband really enjoyed the oysters, but I was disappointed since they were raw (yuck!). If you're a raw oyster fan you will probably enjoy these but if not, nothing to see here.   The bone marrow was not bad at all. Hard to find bone marrow and it's a really good price! Plus it comes with bread. I thought this was a hearty appetizer indeed.  We also purchased a charred octopus from the regular menu. It said sharable but it was really REALLY small. And I felt like the \"charred\" part overtook the flavor. Honestly I enjoyed the happy hour octopus from Pink Taco (in Hard Rock) a lot more and that was half the price. This one was $17.  So why 3 stars? Simply put, this happy hour is kinda lame. I feel like they could throw a few more unique apps on here and round it out. Apparently at one point there was more stuff but they cut back, which is unfortunate. The bone marrow was pretty neat but it isn't worth going out of your way to the restaurant for. I wish they had a charbroiled oyster option too.   Also be warned you can NOT use your Caesars food credit here. You also can't get points on your TR card or use points. But you can charge to the room, which is kinda misleading.",

    "text": "A group of friends and I spent the day watching NCAA Basketball Tournament games at Searsucker at Caesars Palace.  Searsucker is a fun spot to watch sports because it features multiple televisions, is close to the sports book, and has a great menu.    The drink menu includes two gems.  The PB&J old fashion comes with a small PB&J sandwich and has peanuts infused into the drink, which provides a nice sweet flavor.  The Golden Knights old fashion includes chocolate and Smoke Wagon bourbon, a local product.    From the food menu, I enjoyed the seared albacore sandwich, the ears, and the charred octopus.  The albacore sandwich was perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside, with a complementary mayo and bun.  The ears are lightly fried, yet slightly chewy.  The charred octopus was smokey and tender.  The price is about average for a casino restaurant ($13 for drinks, $15 for lunch entrees, and $25 for dinner entrees).  The restaurant was crowded, but not too noisy.  We were able to hear the game and maintain conversation at our table.  The manager, Nick, is extremely personable and welcoming.  He constantly checked on every table, while simultaneously managing the bar.  Our server, Chris, was attentive throughout the day and impressively accommodating to our increasing party.    ALL STAR PEOPLE: Nick and Chris.",

The service was great, they attended to us to make sure our food was good and if we needed more water.   My favorite entrees that we ordered are the Short Ribs, the Scallops, and the Calamari Steak. I highly recommend these three items when you visit Searsucker! The short rib with the mashed potatoes melts in your mouth, the short rib is so tender! The Scallops was buttery and was cooked perfectly! The calamari steaks are like no other calamari that you will ever have in your life! Must-Try!  Another great thing about this place is it's so conveniently located next to OMNIA Nightclub! Definitely a great diner spot before entering OMNIA to party! They even sometimes have promotions where if you can get expedited entry to OMNIA after dinner!  Searsucker is located inside Caesars Palace! TRY IT OUT!",

The location is great because it is at the entrance of the casino.  We started with a drink and the chicharron that was on the Happy Hour menu. This is the best thing we ordered and couldn't of probably had 2 orders because it was that good. The sauce is really what makes this snack. The vinegar and chilli sauce was spectacular. It had a nice spicy kick to it. Our drinks included a beer and the PB&J old fashioned which was delicious. We then ordered the ceasar salad which was loaded with shredded fresh Parmesan. The overall service was also great and we will definitely come back.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Vegas this year so I blindly started to find my way around this 24 hour city.. it being the Mecca of gourmet restaurants, I've been excited to explore the culinary side of the strip. I play poker at various casinos but Caesars has been my recurring spot lately. I found Searsucker a few weeks ago and being new to yelp, I realized I could express my experience publicly as the appreciation is properly due. This causal fine dining restaurant falls nothing short to to expectation. They combine a sports like atmosphere with the TV's at the bar and an almost California rustic lay out. The pretty blonde bartender was the most funny, entertaining person. I made a few friends at the bar because she interacted with all of us together, it's actually a pretty amazing talent to give multiple people so much comfortability and attention that it breaks down that awkward barrier everyone has these days, especially with technology in the way. Bars are meant for that. To pull someone away from their phone and space bubble is hard to do. She honestly illuminates that bar with her personality and it shows. All the bartenders helped guide me through the menu and I ended up devouring the recommendations. I like the simple fact that their menu has causal bar food as well as upscale selections with a twist. The frenched lollipop wings, bone marrow and brussels sprouts were outstanding. I wish I could have ordered the calamari and shishito peppers but I will have to wait until next time. Overall the dishes and service were memorable. The way Vegas should be.",

Specialty cocktails we had: Achilles Peel and the Indian Summer - both delish, but I thought Achilles was stronger!!  (and no complaint on that) ;) ;)  Dinner: The fish & chips is the BEST I've ever had.  Hands down. One diner had the steak and spinach.  Steak was a bit over done but still good and great spinach.  Another diner had the swordfish - was awesome.  Very disappointed on the dessert.  The profiteroles were three teeny tiny puffs and a tablespoon of peanut butter ice cream and gelee squares on the plate.  True profiteroles are BIG puffs with ice cream in the middle.  I get you need to make your artistic mark on your food - but not dessert, people!  Make 'em normal.  Still a great night.  Would recommend and would return.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness. It isn't often that I feel compelled to write a 5-star review, but this place demands it. Hubby and I had the most wonderful meal here. First of all our server, Charles, was hilarious and engaging. This place labels itself as \"a social dining experience\" (hey, it's on the receipt like that) and I think they mean because from the moment you walk in, they try to get to know you. The hostess asked us a few questions, and clearly passed that onto our server before he came over to our table, because he was prepped with the info. He started off with a little joke of singing something, which my husband and I quickly joined in on, so we immediately started off on the right foot. Dinner consisted of all small plates. We got the duck fat fries, mushroom burrata toast, egg & pork belly, and short ribs. The fries are tied for first place as the best fries I've ever had. They were perfectly light and crispy, without being dry. The mushroom & burrata toast was incredible with such flavorful, rich mushrooms. The pork belly is essentially grown up eggs Benedict on broiche toast with Hollandaise. It was good, but sadly not warm when we finally got around to eating it (we ordered too much food!) and the short rib, while tender, was not terribly exciting in the flavor department (think pot roast) but still well cooked and falling-apart tender. After seeing a bunch of desserts pass by the table, hubby and I had some room left in our tummies from just sticking to small plates, so we ordered three, yes three, desserts. The desserts are awesome here. The apple crostata was a lovely rustic pie crust purse filled with caramelized apples. After the warm apples, we went the other direction and got something cold with the Ermagerd Sundae. The peanut butter gelato in this sundae is heavenly. It had such rich peanut butter flavor without being too heavy or losing it's creaminess. We had them bring one dessert at a time so we could digest enough to press on. After all this, we still had another dessert on the way. The finale was the S'more bar. The honey flavor in the graham cracker crust was very robust and I had tasted that wonderful honey in a couple of other dishes. I would love to know what kind of honey they use, it's a good one. The chocolate on top of the crust is a very heavy bodied, rich chocolate mousse, topped with whipped marshmallow topping that is torched. It was all delicious. Our server was great throughout the whole meal and we enjoyed him a lot. The meal was excellent all around and I will definitely come back here each time I go to Vegas. Do not miss the desserts here.",

Nothing spectacular but defiantly worth mention as they did have some uniqueness  and the atmosphere was good. None of the dishes we had were out of this world, but they were good and worth bringing people for a quick bite to eat either before hitting the town or a late night snack as they are open late!  We tried the squid which was a in a sweat and sour sauce very good and full of flavor. Next the short rib was ok. It lacked a little flavor.  We moved on to the shrimp and grits. I think I had high expectations for that dish and it just was lacking a little bit of spice to make that hold statement. The tartar I could have done without, but the pork with the egg was defiantly unique and I think a must!  For dessert you can't go wrong with sunday. They kept on mentioning the cookies with Milk  so we had them and let me just say stick to the sunday!",

    "text": "My boss recommended this place to me because he had heard great reviews from the one in SD. Decided to have my birthday dinner here and overall the food was remarkable. The mussels with chorizo were amazing, the chorizo bits were so tasty gave the whole dish an amazing taste. The squid sweet heat was probably the best squid I have had and this tends to be a dish I order at every restaurant and is by far the best tasting here at Searsucker. All of the appetizers came in large sizes. We also got the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup towards the end, and OMG, loved them! I'm not a duck fan but you really couldn't taste duck. I got the mahi baja dish the meat was so tender and those almonds and drunken cherries just blended in very well in every bite. My boyfriend got the hanger butcher steak and he thought it was okay. The only disappointing thing and the reason why I didn't give five stars is because the entree is literally just the piece of meat, the dishes don't come with anything else like a side. Good thing we had ordered the duck fat fries along with the entrees. Their cocktail ballerina and the czar was good. To end the dinner our awesome waitress recommended the s'mores bar for dessert, so glad she did! Not one crumb was left of that. Oh, not to mention the service was great our waiter was so friendly and kept checking up on us to make sure our experience was going great, she even started a conversation with us and mentioned how she loved locals coming into Searsucker.",

I think they are still trying to work out their preparation since it's new.  We started with a Ballerina and the Czar cocktail which was amazing.  We had the farm bird lollipops and they were very flavorful.  The shrimp and bacon grits dish was over sauced and the hot sauce flavor was so strong you couldn't taste the bacon.  The mahi mahi was overcooked and had the consistency of chicken.  The short ribs were excellent as was the strawberry and champagne vinegrette salad.  The warm chocolate chip cookies were absolutely to die for.  They bring a cup of cold milk for dipping.",

I was a bit hesitant to go here, because Old Homestead is my absolute favorite restaurant and its literally around the corner from Searsucker.  I decided to change things up a bit and try this brand new spot at Caesars.  Started off with the eggs + bacon \"pork belly\"and it was outstanding, I highly suggest it, as it's quite a difference from your normal appetizer. Me and my mother split the tomahawk with a side of bacon grits, and I have to say this steak was unbelievable.  Was it as good as Homestead's ribeye?  Obviously this stuff is subjective, and I'm biased towards them,  but I'll definitely say it's up there, and a bit better than STK's ribeye.  Honestly one of the top 10 meals I've ever had, and we didn't even do dessert.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this location of Seersucker, since the San Diego location is fun!  However, I would have to say my meal was probably in top 5 grossest things I've ever had in a restaurant and I've had Mexican food in London!  If rating on just my main dish, I would have given zero stars, the 2-star rating is because the place itself is nice and our waiter was pleasant.  For the main dish, both my friend and I ordered the quinoa.  I want to say that I love quinoa dishes and order them frequently around town.  I have always loved them which is why I thought the roasted vegetables and quinoa here would be delicious!  IT WAS NOT.  It was gross - basically soggy tasting dirt.  There was a big mound of really wet quinoa, not flavored at all except for the gross dirt taste, a couple sliced sweet potatoes (that were kind-of hard and just tasted plain) and there might have been a couple slivers of kale.  I kept trying to take some more bites, thinking it couldn't be so gross as I thought, but finally I had to give up.  My friend also thought it tasted gross.  I was kind of surprised the waiter didn't say anything when he took our plates, since both were almost completely untouched, he didn't even ask if we liked it.  Not that I expected anything - I obviously made a bad choice, but thought it was weird all the same.  I will not be coming back here.  I think they should be embarrassed to serve such a bad dish.  For the money we spent I really expected something great or at least edible, not soggy dirt.  Gross!",

We came to Searsucker Las Vegas  on Christmas day. We have been to the one in San Diego for drinks, and it was so good we wanted to try vegas. Well it was disappointing. Especially when the GM of the restaurant is leaning agains the counter by the open kitchen, looking out to the tables while constantly being on his phone. We were there for 2 hours and for the 2 hours he was on his phone and didnt look up or come to any tables. The open kitchen is ment to he a show for the dining guests. Everytime i would look up to watch the show I was so distracted by the eye sore of the main manager engulfed in his phone. Grant it he may have been checking important emails but for goodness sake go off the floor to do so. Very taky. Very unprofessional. When i mentioned this to other people they also experienced the GM on his phone. Bad dining experience wont be back.",

    "text": "We recently had dinner at Searsucker at Caesar's Palace. Never having visited any of their locations, I was a little nervous about their over-emphasis on \"social dining\" -  sorry, I'm not interested in making new friends during dinner - but, honestly, I didn't notice this in action at the restaurant; we had a four-top for the 4 of us and from what I could see, each group dining had their own space. So that was a relief.  I had no expectations going in and was really very, very pleased with everything we order, from the cocktails to the apps and entrees. We eat a lot in Vegas, like most people, and have eaten both at medium and high end restaurants in that city. For us, particular standouts were the eggs + bacon \"pork belly\", with pork that I swear melted in your mouth, it was so tender, and my loin \"filet\" (not sure why they love to put words in quotes so much...), with lobster butter + mushroom demi glace.    Even though this is a positive review, I do need to add one negative note. Here's what drove me crazy about Searsucker: They have a bathroom attendant in both the men and women's bathroom. In this modern day and age, there is absolutely no f*&#ing reason to have an individual in a bathroom whose sole purpose is to hand you a paper towel, and to be tipped for doing so. But what makes it worse here is that, at least the men's bathroom, is TINY- there is only ONE vanity sink, hemmed in a very small area and this tuxedo-clad attendant (who, upon my entry, startled me by yelling \"Hey, Boss! Welcome to the Men's Room!\") and I had to awkwardly jockey for position in front of it, with him adding value to his service by waving his hand in front of the faucet motion sensor to get my tap started. It's completely ridiculous, awkward and uncomfortable and I know several of us at our table were actually painfully putting off trips to the bathroom just to avoid it. So, if you are reading this Searsucker, ditch the ridiculous bathroom attendants!  But otherwise, we were really very pleased with drinks, food and service. Vegas has too many great places to eat for me to promise to make it back here, but I also wouldn't complain if that ended up happening.",

The searsucker was one of the only restaurants open at the time; the ambiance appeared nice from the outside, so we have it a shot. 1st look at menu revealed extremely high prices ($46 for fish and chips!). Our experience was that food was average at best and not worth the cost. Duck fat fries, which we were told was one of the specialties, was not savory. The best appetizer was the steak calamari. The best part of our experience at this restaurant was service; our waitress was outstanding, attentive, and very friendly. Also, food arrived fast. Overall, we felt food was not worth cost, and being from NYC, I am somewhat accustomed to pricey places but expect quality in return!",

We ordered a couple of items I read reviews about on Yelp and they were AMAZING!  I had the eggs and bacon and let me tell you I would drive across town just to have that again and again and again!  We also ordered the short rib. Excellent.  My husband had the Pork Butt entree based on our waitress, Tammy's, recommendation. He was not disappointed!  The table next to us ordered the bone marrow. Apparently, a waiter in the Austin restaurant started a trend of pouring a shot of bourbon through the bone to get any remaining marrow. Keep that in mind if you order the bone marrow! Sounds fantastic.  Dessert was good too. Interesting though that as stellar as the entrees and small plates were the desserts weren't quite as outstanding (and I am a dessert fiend). However, Tammy did recommend the cookies and we opted for the s'mores and sundae. Again, they were very good, just not as outstanding as the other food. Tammy said that she bakes cookies at home and the cookies there are the best she's ever had. Definitely trying the cookies next time.  FYI - the music is loud and there are no soft surroundings. Be prepared for it to be noisy.  We will definitely be returning!",

Our waitress seemed overwhelmed - everything was very slow. At one point she came to check on us well after we had ordered and said, \"How is everything?

    "text": "Brian Malarkey has joined the bandwagon of celebrity chefs and finally opened his own restaurant in Caesar's. Located right next to Omnia, the offerings aren't limited to seafood. Every Vegas restaurant has to offer steak and Searsucker is no different. But, I like some of the farm offerings as well including pork, chicken, and even rabbit. For Vegas standards, the entree prices are on par, but I see a lot of value in the small plates. We went with a large party for my friend's 30th birthday so we got to try a little bit of everything.   For starters, the cheddar puffers were as addictive as those crack cheddar biscuits from Red Lobster back in the day. Check-in on Yelp for a free serving of the habanero, coriander pickles. A word of warning, the pickles were delicious, but do NOT eat the habaneros (from experience). The roasted shishito peppers in ponzu were some of my favorites. The texture and flavor was almost like that of a shiitake mushroom. Of the small plates, the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup was outstanding. The mussels were great too, but I didn't get much flavor from the beef tartare.   Seeing as Malarkey is known for seafood, I opted to get the mahi. The drunken cherries and smokey almonds outshined the actual fish. I could eat a whole bowl of just that sauce. The pork butt is another popular dish if you're not feeling the seafood. The desserts were great too and worth sampling. The \"ermahgerd\" sundae was delicious, but my favorite was the s'mores bar.   I would definitely come back for happy hour, which runs 4:30-6:00 pm. We ended up spending over $75 per person, which was pricey, but ended up getting us into Omnia for free to see Nicky Romero. You bypass the general admission line as well. Win!",

We had already eaten dinner when we stopped in for a round of drinks, but the menu looked really impressive. We ordered a round, and the drinks were not out of control expensive (It's Vegas, so I'm typically expecting about $15-$20 for a drink depending on which casino you're in)... I got a really nice glass of NZ sav blanc for $13, and the specialty cocktails ran about $15 a pop. Will definitely return the next time I'm at Ceasar's Palace.",

The only entree was the quinoa dish which was basically a soggy mound of quinoa with a little bit of steamed spinach underneath, topped with a few shreds of raw carrots and some micro greens. The dish was very bland and disappointing for $23. The beet salad was pretty good. It had golden beet chunks with a creaming dressing. And there were these two little fried cheese balls that were a nice surprise! Overall, it had a Nice sweet flavor but was a very small portion. The best dish was the side of brussels spouts with walnuts. They were charred with balsamic, tangy and tender.   Service was average, and food was average as well. Nothing stood out about this experience that would warrant s repeat visit.",

    "text": "It's barely been open for 6 months and is super easy to find! (right next to Omnia and the sportsbook)  but 5 Stars for HAPPY HOUR! It runs from 4:30pm-6:00pm Monday-Friday.  If you want to sample many of their dishes without paying the premium prices! I suggest stopping by for happy hour. Be wary, it's only in the bar area so if the hosts walks you over to the dining area, just let her know you're there for happy hour and drinks.  The menu has about a dozen items and it's significantly discounted! Food comes out \"shared\" style but to be honest, the portions are fairly large compared to other \"small plate\" or tapas style places.  We had the:  Farm Bird Lollipops - Chicken meatballs that are seared on a stick. You get three per order and they serve it over an arugala and bleu cheese salad!  Caesar Salad - MAN as a \"side salad\" this thing was HUGE. Only $6 well worth it.  Spicy Squid - Lightly battered squid in a hot and sour sauce. Pretty tasty, but I wish it was more crispy.   Short Rib - Super moist braised short rib over mashed potatoes. If you're buzzing and need something warm to sober you up, this dish will do the trick. $10 but portion size is fairly decent.  The cocktails and drinks are also discounted too. Most of them are under $7-$8 (marked down from $12-$16).   Service was great. Well worth it! We had all those dishes mentioned and 2 drinks each..came out to about $70. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good experience!",

The goat cheese was smeared across one side of plate then salad placed on side. I had never seen that before and it was sorta good but also made me think, what if they just didn't wash this plate? Lol As main course had the beer braised short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes. That was delicious, I had been on a no carb diet and eating those potatoes was like eating a rainbow for me. Very tasty. I didn't really get the 3 onion rings on top 1 would have been plenty but didn't think it really went with rest of dish.   For dessert had the milk and cookies which was amazing and couldn't finish them all so got some for breakfast snack.  My server was great.",

Not having much time, we decided to just try a few dishes at the bar. BTW, their happy hour menu is really awesome here. I've posted a pic of it.  Crab cake was awesome. I can say the best I've had. Loved all the elements that came with it including the aioli and Tabasco caviar.  Squid was nice. Not your typical fried calamari. It's a slice up a calamari steak, batter, fried and tossed in a sweet mild chili sauce. Think calamari steak fries.  Duck fat fries were nice but chipotle ketchup threw it off for me. We asked if they have regular ketchup, they don't. The fries have a crisp that you won't get frying with typical oil.  After some amazing apps, the short rib underwhelmed. It was very typical and a bit bland.  I like my drinks sweet, this is not the place for sweet drinks. We had the Indian Summer and Achilles Peel. Achilles Peel was better but we had to ask for simple syrup.  Our server Lindsey was super cool. She was friendly, knowledgeable and was on top of everything we needed.  Will be back for dinner next time!",

Yes everything is glamorized and every casino restaurant has a celebrity chef's name attached to it.  I only know Brian Malarkey from The Taste show.  His take on food is creative, yet comforting and not too out there.  Simple well known flavors that are combined and work well.  We only had three different dishes and all were delicious and tasty.  Brie Triple + Strawberry Jam - Not sure what the \"triple\" means, but you get three crostinin's, a nice size cut of brie topped with jam to even out the flavor and thickness of the brie.  Good starter!  Egg + Bacon (pork belly) -  This a similar take on eggs benedict.  You have a nice toasted piece of bread, layered with slow cooked tender juicy pork belly and topped with a poached egg and gravy.  Every bite was savory and sumptuous.  For our main entree we both had the Loin Filet (yah we are adventurous).  I guess these new age chefs dont like to call it filet mignon any more, but in essence thats what it was.  It was flavorful, tender and a good sized serving for $40.  The lobster butter and mushroom demi gave it that punch it needed to not make it the boring filet mignon served at your favorite steakhouse.  Service was quick and pleasant, but we didnt have the connection with our servers you can feel when they really enjoy their job.    I liked that it was casual and not stuffy, high end.  Nice addition to the vegas scene.",

    "text": "This is celebrity chef Brian Malarkey's foray into the Las Vegas food scene. The restaurant is divided into three sections and there's a bar area with eating/drinking overlooking the casino.   Four of us met for dinner and ordered a number of small plates, greens, and main courses.  We shared all items ordered and here's the list:  Egg and pork belly Short ribs Brie and cranberry jam Cowboy caviar Shrimp and grits Mushrooms and burrata Strawberry, champagne, walnut, and goat cheese salad Spinach, bacon, mushroom, and sweetbread salad Jalapeno-chorizo corn off the cob Pork butt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion Duck with white bean, confit, and fig Brussels sprouts and walnuts Mahi \"baja\" with drunken cherries and smokey almonds Apple crostata Ermahgerd sundae S'mores Pumpkin cake  While waiting for all four to arrive, two of us were given a container of cheddar puffs and more were brought when we were all seated.  We discussed what each found interesting on the menu.  The head chef joined us and explained the entire menu and he gave us some suggestions.  The outstanding items were the egg and pork belly, cowboy caviar, the strawberry salad, pork butt, Brussels spouts, egg and pork belly, and the mahi.  Of those items, the mahi was the best thing of the night.  The char and the perfect grilling of the mahi made it an incredible dish.  The cowboy caviar, a.k.a. bull testicle, was tender and had a light breading before frying.    The pork belly was quite thick but was tender and cooked well.  I was surprised at how much I liked the strawberry frisee salad.  The champagne dressing with the walnuts and goat cheese was very refreshing and tasty!    The pork butt was done nicely so that it was pull apart goodness.  There was a discussion about the Brussels sprouts.  I was very fond of this dish and I found the crisp char on the sprouts to be just to my liking.  My only disappointment was the brie with cranberry jam.  The brie had lost all flavor and it really needed the jam to give the dish some taste.  I'd skip this one.  As for dessert, we agreed the S'mores topped the others.  The menu describes the dessert as Graham + salted caramel ganache + honey chocolate mousse + marshmallow + chocolate ice cream + cookie crumble.  The Ermahgerd sundae was also good.  It's described as Peanut butter gelato + peanut coffee \"rocks\" + caramel+brownies + bruleed banana.  The pumpkin cake and the apple crostata were also very good.  I think I could go back and have all five of the desserts but skip the 6th--cookies and milk--and I'd have had a memorable time!  Great ending to our feast!  Service was excellent.  Jeremy--our main server--came from the original Searsucker in San Diego and he was top notch in everything.  We were given clean share plates and utensils for each course.  Jeremy coursed our selections perfectly so we didn't get a whole lot at any one time.  Water was replenished often.  For a new place, they are really doing things well.  Plating was nicely done, the flavors are complex, and the textures are good.    I'll have to get back here if they put back on the menu the rabbit and wild boar chops that are listed online but have been removed from the printed restaurant menu.",

    "text": "Dinner on a Friday evening just a few days after they opened and Searsucker already had a decent amount of people seated, enjoying their food.  We were seated in an awkward table in a walkway on the way to the restroom so my chair got kicked and bumped on a number of occasions. If I were to return I would ask for a more secluded table.  I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal with several dining companions which gave us a chance to order and sample a number of items from the menu.  For a new restaurant service already seemed on point, but that may just have been our good fortune to get the only server in the restaurant that came over from the Searsucker location in San Diego. He was knowledgable, friendly and very attentive.   Our plates came out in a well-balanced manner. Never inundating us with too much food so we were able to sample at a leisurely pace.  My favorites from the evening were the mahi, pork butt, egg and pork belly and surprisingly the strawberry salad. Each of these dishes were well-cooked and the flavors were on point.   The rest of the food was good, but didn't leave a lasting impression with me. I love brussel sprouts but these weren't as crispy as I like and seemed drowned in garlic, not really allowing me to enjoy the flavor of the vegetable. I was in the minority in my opinion of this dish, so it might just be a personal preference.   Of the desserts we sampled, the smores dish came out as a table favorite. Even I, who am neither a huge fan of chocolate or smores, enjoyed it, though I couldn't take more than a bite since it was rich. This dish is best shared. The rest of the desserts didn't really do as much for me, but they were decent. Again, I was in the minority on this opinion, so it may be due to my lack of sweet tooth.   Searsucker is already ahead of the game after opening so recently. Good service, excellent location and decent food to boot. With their eclectic menu and late night availability I see them being successful in catering to the pre-show and after clubbing crowd quite well.",

    "text": "Tammie  One of my favorite experiences in Vegas... Let's start with the basics... Food - EXCELLENT Service - EXCELLENT  Value - GOOD Decor - Rustic/Sophisticated Hubby and I went in for Happy Hour (5-7pm daily). We arrived around 5:30 and found a table top by the bar. We started off with a Springtime Collins from the HH cocktail menu ($8). Very refreshing and a great start to our meal. We ordered a few items of the HH menu and regular menu (everything looked delicious, I would have ordered one of everything if I could have).  1/2 dozen oysters (reg. menu $3/ea), which happened to be from Washington, HH Tuna Tacos ($9), HH Shishito Peppers ($9), and the Bone Marrow (reg menu $19). Everything was tasty! I'm used to only seeing green shishito peppers but this order came with red and green, very colorful and well-seasoned. The bone marrow was excellent! Pure indulgence. Topped with crispy brussel sprout leaves and served with bruschetta toast to be devoured with the melty buttery marrow goodness. Highly recommend.   And then we have the dessert... WOW! First of all, everything on the dessert menu looks delicious, so you better save room. We ordered the s'mores bar served with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and I would have regretted it if we didn't. Perfect balance of marshmallow to silky honey chocolate mousse to chewy graham cracker base. I usually find many desserts too sweet and I couldn't keep my fork away from this thing. A must order.   And finally... the service, absolutely excellent. Our server Tammie (Tammy?)  was amazing. She knew everything on the menu, in detail, and had a great attitude. One of my favorite experiences in Vegas. Will be back on our next visit for sure.   P.S. I've been to their location in San Diego and it was just as amazing! Praying for a Seattle location!!!",

Everything was OK, there was nothing I ate that I would say was exceptional. However, everything did \"look\" pretty tasty and while it did taste good, again, nothing special.  We ordered the grilled cheese, a couple salads, the tuna tacos and some sliders. I would say the grilled cheese was the best of all these selections. Nice presentation and really tasty as well.  My one gripe about our experience was our waitress, she seems so over it before our wine even came out. It was a bummer because I truly believe the experience is a huge part of eating out (at least for me). She was dry and emotionless and seemed annoyed overall, which put a damper on our experience, unfortunately. Also, the place was pretty empty, which was weird for a Saturday night in Vegas at 9 pm.   I think I prefer Herringbone Las Vegas...but probably wouldn't turn down coming here again, the food was decent enough to try again.",

Then, when he did come, he just asked if we were ready; didn't ask if we wanted drinks or explain the menu at all.   We ordered the mushrooms and burrata: it was good. The mushrooms were nicely seasoned but that's about it. We then ordered the shrimp and grits; nothing special. The food runner did great explaining the dishes though, so that was a plus. They then dropped off the lollipops (which we didn't order). I stated that we did not order them and the guy said that they were on the house. We weren't sure why. We tried 2 of them and weren't impressed so we just had them take them back. Our server then informed us that whomever dropped them at the table, made a mistake, so they really weren't \"on the house\" or compliments of anyone; it was just a mistake.   Based on the two starters, we quickly decided not to waste the money on an entree. We ordered the ermagerd sundae and continued to wait for about 20-25 minutes before getting it. Really?! Being a pastry chef, it was obvious that everything in that dish was premade and just needed to be thrown together. The server came over after about 15 minutes to apologize and tell us that the person who makes the desserts also makes the salads and was in the weeds because of a large party. We got it about 10 minutes later. It was ice cream and two baby brownie bites and bananas; there's nothing bad you can really say about it.  The service really killed the experience. For two of us that work at a semi-fine dining restaurant in Chicago, we really expected more, but weren't that surprised. These places turn over thousands of guests, and it was apparent that they had that mentality. We wanted to spend a good penny here and order a bunch off the menu, but it all just started so poorly. Kinda a shame ..",

Dan; an alcoholic ice tea lemonade perfect for those who like strong herbal tea flavors.  -Snake in the grass;  a classic mojito with lots of mint.  -Pan Seared Scallops with Couscous and Citrus Sauce;  three jumbo size scallops cooked to tender perfection on a bed of couscous with pesto and citrus sauce. The  couscous was delicious and blends very well with the thick pesto sauce; however, there was that additional sweet and sour like sauce  that the boyfriend and I weren't fond of because it didn't add to anything.     -The Porkbutt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion was the most popular and recommended dish, but had mixed reactions from us. I'll admit the pork was so tender, so moist,  and practically melted in our mouths, but I found the porkbutt and bacon emulsion too salty and overwhelming. If you love salty foods like the boyfriend, then this is a must try dish.  I do love the whiskey apples which added a crunchy texture and pickled flavor to combat the salty and fatty porkbutt.   Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back to try the duck next time.",

    "text": "We were 3 for dinner here a few nights ago. I have been a big fan of Searsucker since discovering it in San Diego a few years ago. I had mentioned at that time that the Pork Belly entree I had would be a contender as a last meal request should I ever be condemned. On this visit, my wife and I and our friend decided to share some small plates and then choose entrees. We had the Tuna Poke which was excellent and served with crunchy tortilla crackers. We also had the grilled Shishito peppers which  wonderfully seasoned with soy sauce and not too hot, though with Shishitos you never know when you'll get a real burner! We also had the spicy shrimp ceviche which was served with crispy taro root chips. All three were superb! For the mains both our friend and I had the Pork Butt (The Pork Belly I longed for was not on offer) However, the Butt was tender and perfectly cooked, and was served with some sides that I also really liked but don't recall just now. My wife had the scallops, which is always a fave of hers and these did not disappoint! They shared a slice of lemon cheesecake which they described as \"pretty awesome!\" All around this is a fantastic place for dinner.  The only thing I would say that misses the mark at this location is that it's slightly too bright and they had huge TV's playing Monday night football at top volume, that made it difficult to have a normal conversation. The other Searsucker location was intimate and dim and would be a great date place, this location seems to be more like a sports bar which was incongruent with the food offerings.",

    "text": "As a southerner, searsucker represents classic southern charm and sophistication. This place was definitely shooting for that theme of country chic I guess you could say. They had decorated with pallet wall accents and some food was served in mason jars. The menu (especially apps) seemed to be twists on traditional southern favorites. We had the beef tartare and it was served in a mason jar with a wooden spoon. It came with crunchy toast and a small bowl of insanely good spicy pickles. The tartare hit the mark for sure. We got the pear and goat cheese salad which was also quite delicious. We ordered cocktails and wine during our meal and the service was definitely on point. We didn't wait for anything and our waitress checked in frequently. For the entree we got the swordfish grilled plain (there is an option for sauce that I skipped) and we got the shortrib. The shortrib was excellent although not the best I have ever had. But I can say the only place that ever beat it was a small farm to table restaurant in our hometown. The swordfish was lacking. Maybe I should have gone with a choice of sauce with it but I am a minimalist when it comes to food choosing to really taste the freshness and the quality of a meat over the accoutrements. It was a little over cooked but the side of Brussels was some of the best I've ever tasted. It came with an assortment of roasted peppers that were very tasty as well. We got the duck fat fries as a side for the shortrib and these are a must!   The atmosphere is a mix of country meets Vegas and it comes off a little weird to me. The theme could have been pushed a little more to really drive it home but I understand this is a Caesars palace restaurant and the type of customer it caters to. I can say that the bathroom attendants were very pushy and overbearing but that has nothing really to do with the food. Overall...this is a great restaurant with some unique twists on dishes. I wouldn't say it's spectacular and we did have better food for the same price (around $200 for two people). But I am definitely not regretful we tried it....the beef tartare, pickles, duck fat fries and service made it worth the experience.",

The service was professional - from the time my friend and I sat down until we closed out we were treated as if we were at a 5 star steakhouse. I ordered the Achilles Peel to start - although the drink was more potent than I thought I could still taste the sweet flavor or mixed berry. For an appetizer my friend and I started with an order of crab cakes. The order was smaller than we though and tasted salty - although the garnish on top of the crab cake helped take down our sodium levels. For my entree - I ordered the filet which was super tender and very easy to cut. I wasn't a fan of the sauce that was on top of the filet but the mushroom sauce on the bottom helped with the flavor. For dessert - we ordered the banana bread pudding which was sweet but still crunchy. The server was thoughtful and put Happy Birthday near the bottom of the banana bread. Our overall experience at Searsucker was okay but I would definitely try the place again. It's nice to feel like a VIP on your birthday.",

For mains, I ordered the loin \"filet\"  with lobster butter and mushroom demi. The filet was cooked to the perfect temperature. I also tried some of the salmon which was also delicious as well.  Now, my absolute favorite part of dinner was the dessert. I tried the S'mores bar and the Cookies  and Milk. Both were perfect toppers to a delicious meal. Never thought a ordinary food combination like milk and cookies could actually taste so unique.  The staff and management were very welcoming and provided me and my group with a unique and great dining experience. Managers stopped by our table to greet us, and even Chef Brian Malarkey stopped by our table to ask us how everything was.   Definitely a must-see in Las Vegas!",

We didn't ask for it to be taken off the bill, but the waitress should've asked when she noticed we didn't like it when only of the lollipops were missing from the dish (which was on my plate) when we asked her to take it away.

We were here to see Absinthe and didn't want a huge meal so we went with the small plates.  We did the Tuna Poke, Duck Fat Fries, Scallop special, and S'mores desert.  Each dish was excellent and easily filled us up.  We will come back once more before we leave",

When the hostess in black felt that I was checking what they were on... She changed the screen to the seating arrangement screen... Busted!!!!  And sat us.

    "text": "Came here on Sunday with a group of girls for a bachelorette weekend of fun. This was our last night in Vegas and wanted to have an awesome dinner.   I mostly rated this place based on service..I mean maybe it would have been 3 stars if the food was better.  I was super hungover on Sunday so I only got myself a salad. I did try some of the other girl's food and it wasn't anything too special.  I really wish I remembered what our waiters name was, because for the response be gave me and the type of restaurant this place is, I would have expected kinder service.  One of the girls at the end of dinner asked our waiter for a togo box. As she asked him, I also asked him if I could get a box too. His response was, he pointed his finger in the air and told me to \"hold on, I can only do ONE thing at a time\" he said \"my assistant will box it up\" then he looked away and ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME and mummered \"okay\" to himself with crazy eyes and walked away.  I thought I was totally tripping when he did that to me, but 2 other girls saw what he did so I knew I wasn't tripping, nor did I say anything or give him attitude.  Then, we asked for dessert menu and he handed everyone their Happy Hour menu and walked away really fast. We had to ask \"his assistant\" for the right menu since he wasn't around.  I really don't know what was up his butt, maybe drugs or something but I've never been talked to that way nor had their eyes roll at me at a restaurant when requesting a box.",

    "text": "Where do I even begin?! Searsucker in Las Vegas, NV has become one of my favorite restaurants! Located inside the beautiful Caesars Palace, Searsucker knows how to satisfy every type of craving you may have. The restaurant has a rustic new aged feel with a little romance added in. The best part of course is the food!  With so many options to choose from, I love to order from the \"Smalls\" portion of the menu. These dishes come big enough for your appetite but small enough so you can order more than one.  Lets start with one of my favorite dishes, the Duck Fat Fries. Can you say Heaven? These will blow your mind. Crispy on the outside (but not burnt) and a taste that is very different than your normal french fries, this dish is guaranteed to make you want more!  Another mouthwatering dish you MUST try is the Brie \"Triple\", Cranberry Jam and Cowboy Caviar. The flavor from the jam compliments the brie in a way that I can't describe. You get sweet, you get cheese and you get crunchy all in one dish.  A must try while in Las Vegas, Searsucker will take you on a flavorful ride that you won't want to get off of. Let's give a big round of applause to Celebrity Chef Brian Malarkey for bringing us, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants Las Vegas has seen in a while.

We went right when they were supposed to open at 5, and we were basically told they weren't ready to open. So we waited for a bit until they were. Then we were seated in the bar area. It took quite some time for a server to approach us, and when she did, she wasn't exactly bursting with excitement about her job. I ordered the sliders and partner ordered some sort of taco thing. Both were okay, but nothing we would have raved about given the other high end options we visited while we were in town. As others have mentioned, it's dark and loud, so while it was fine when we first got there, but about 6 p.m. it was crowded and overbearing. In all, I probably would have gone with 3 on the food and drink alone (and the happy hour deals were nice), but the service was poor enough that I took it down one star.",

Flavors here are extraordinary. Best brussels side of any restaurant anywhere and ive had it everywhere. The corn n chorizo side is also stellar rich in citrus flavor. The sliders we ordered was piping burning hot when we bit into them, rich in flame grilled flavor and a nicer portion than at Spago. Both salads were first rate. Loved the lemony zest of the Caesar without thr garlic overkill and the Pear & walnut salad was taken up a notch with the whipped goat cheese garnish   The Calamari was just ok. Liked the asian twist and apples. Would have liked it better served traditionally cut thin in rings and tentacles.  Friendly service at the bar and s'mores dessert was killer good. One day ill get around to ordering an entree. In the meantime, im hopeful Searsucker becomes a Caesars fixture for a long time to come.",

Happy hour is from 400pm to 630pm, everyday.  The happy hour menu is pretty awesome because it includes your usual wells, wines, but for me, what I love is that they have different draft beers on special.  I'm talking $5 drafts on special.  On the Las Vegas strip, that is almost unheard of!  As far as happy hour menu, they have about ten items on special.  My go to is Shishito peppers and duck fat fries.  They just recently changed up the menu and added a few more items.  Last night I tried the pork chips.  It was okay, perfect for when your drinking and the right size portion for complimenting your beer.  For me, too sweet on the pork, but I guess that's to balance the saltiness of the chips.  Staff, always friendly and quick with service.  Service with a smile! Searsucker is awesome!",

We were going to see a show, so we kept it pretty simple.  Ordered a caesar salad to split, and our entrees.  The two entrees we had were Beef Ribs with horseradish mash. YUM!!! And very filling!! The other was a piece of grilled swordfish which included a choice of sauce and side. Both were fantastic.  The \"share plates\" looked so interesting, I want to go back just to site and nibble on little social plates! So many interesting things on there that looked good to try!  As for service, I have noticed many criticisms for bad service, I am happy to say that absolutely was not our experience!! The woman who was helping us was attentive and an asset to the dining experience.",

They had some really good looking dishes on happy hour but the really selling point was the price! Drinks $5-8 and apps for $9 is pretty much unheard of in Las Vegas, especially on the strip. We each got a drink, nothing special. For apps my favorite was the duck fat prosciutto dusted fries. They were perfectly crispy, probably twice fried. We also got the tomato burrata which was delicious but didn't really fit the theme of the other food. We also got there sliders (opted for lettuce wrapped) and the seasoning of the meat was very good. There was cheddar and bacon mixed into the meat itself which you could tell it really enhanced the flavor. My coworker got the tuna tacos, which were in wonton wrappers. There was a pretty large about of tuna but she said they weren't seasoned very well. All around, I would go back for happy hour by stick to the sliders and fries.",

    "text": "So we decided to try this place for our anniversary (14 years).   It started really well. We had 1/2 dozen east coast oysters. They were delicious (although, I'd have preferred them a little colder).   Next we had bone marrow, also delicious. Seriously, it was very good.   For our entrees, Mike had thr scallops, and I had the burger, medium, which is pertinent to this review.   The burger is supposed to be a big deal, they only make 20 a day.   When my burger arrived, I took a bite out of it, raw. Like, not even warm in the middle.   After I found our server, Giana (she seemed put out to be serving us from the beginning), I sent it back.   Then we waited... and waited...  Then I got my burger, which was the exact burger I had sent back. I know this because I could see the bite I took out of it.   Seriously, if I went to McDonald's they would have made me a new burger, you'd expect a celebrity chef (as stated on the menu) to at least have a service standard on par with a fast food joint.   I started eating. And I just got more angry.   It's a burger with relish and avocado. Why would you reheat that? Gross!  And is it even sanitary?    Do you want to have a steak cooked on a grill after some stranger has taken a bite out of it.   I felt bad for the manager though. He tried. He came over and acknowledged the problem.   Offered some short ribs, which is nice, but I hate that.   I'm supposed to eat by myself, while Mike watches, because a fine dining restaurant doesn't know how to cook a burger.",

On the good side, the hostesses seated us early for our reservation and the server was prompt and courteous, but not overly friendly. The appetizer of Toast (charred slice of bread with goat cheese, fig and honey) was delicious. I would have preferred two smaller pieces to one large, but that's not a big deal. Old fashioned cocktails were too sweet for my taste, but nicely made with large ice chunks (preventing too much melt) and Luxardo cherries.  On the bad side, the wild boar pasta was a disaster. They should just take it off the menu. I wish my server had been honest with me when I asked about it. Way too much sauce to pasta - I had to fish around for pieces of pasta. Also, pasta shape was not good - it was a long curled pasta (I might call cavatelloni) that you had to cut in half to eat; this dish should be served with pappardelle or fettuccine. The sauce was ridiculously over salty. I couldn't eat but about a third of it. In hindsight, I should have sent it back. My husband got the limited edition burger (only 20 made per night), which was fine, but nothing special. The bottom bun had become saturated with juices, forcing him to eat it with a knife and fork. Fries that came with the burger were good - also pretty salty.",

We had to stop and asked for direction from 3 different restaurant hosts!  3 star. * Meals: delicious! Every bite is tasty and perfect! 5 star. * service: excellent! Everyone is very friendly and helpful! 5 star.  This is averaged to 4 star for me!  Came in on a Wednesday night and the place was half empty. We were a bit nervous but glad that we came.  The meal is perfect! Poke: fresh and perfectly seasoning served with taro chip. $19  Scottish salmon: perfectly glazed and tender! Chimichuri sauce is sweet and tangy taste which went well with the salmon. $36  Fish and chip:moist and tender with thin but crispy shell. $42.  Snore bar: graham, chocolate ganage, chocolate mouse packed in a bar served with chocolate ice cream. Not too sweet. The bar is perfect mixed between sweet, salty, chocolate softness and crunchy. $11.  We always are big fan for chef Brian Malarkey on Top chef and are not disappointed! The only reason that this place is not packed because of the price! Since there are so many restaurants by celebrity chefs nearby with 10-20% less, many people would chose others!",

We attempted to have a drink at the bar, but were told for 20 minutes that a waitress would come over and no one came. Whatever, still stayed strong and waited for our table.  We never actually met our waitress, but had the manager wait on us.  He was funny at first, until he basically lied and sold us sides like a dirty used car salesman.  He told us that the potatoes with the short rib and the corn with the scallops was minuscule.  He legit said it was 2 small slices of potato and that we needed to order 3 sides.  Because I didn't think we were at a seedy upwelling restaurant, we trusted him and were incredibly surprised when we received our huge meals (large helping of potatoes, not 2 slices) with no need for 3 $18 sides.  The sides were disappointing and in no way worth the price.  The Mac and cheese was apparently \"the best on the strip\" and stuffers tastes better.  The food was good, but I cannot get past the unprofessionalism of this establishment.  I felt uncomfortable when he came back to check on us, I told him I was disappointed that he misled us and he just laughed it off and we were later presented with our $350 bill.",

    "text": "Had dinner here with a large group recently, and while there was a lot to like, there were some issues as well. We were seated promptly upon arrival, and the space is definitely nice and comfortable. Drink orders were taken and delivered fairly promptly considering how busy the place was (Thursday evening dinner time).   After perusing the menu, we decided to get appetizers and spread them around; this netted us some tasty small plates. Among them, tender and flavorful lollipop wings, which featured a mild but distinct Buffalo style sauce with a delicious bleu cheese fondue for dipping. These were my go-to for the evening. Sliced calamari steak with chili honey glaze had a nice, thin breading giving way to a very tender and not at all rubbery interior; this dish was a major hit with the group. Another standout was the tuna poke and shaved tarot root; this featured a jar of deep red tuna poke with sesame seeds, onion, radish, and a little sriracha for heat, and was delicious on the crispy tarot chips. Unfortunately, an order of shishito peppers didn't make it to the table.  Things took a turn, though, when entrees were delivered. Me and another guest were sharing the bone-in New York strip, requested medium rare; it was delivered quite rare, well outside any notion of medium rare. This is difficult to forgive at this price point and service level. Upon letting our server know, she immediately requested a replacement from the kitchen, and while it was more properly cooked, it had also been pre-sliced, which seemed unusual to me. The flavor and seasoning were nice, but it put us a little out of step servicewise with our fellow guests.   Finally, we topped off the meal with a dessert that featured small ice cream cookie sandwiches; these were very good, with cookies that were fresh and decadent, and creamy ice cream that was very far from ordinary.   The service errors with the appetizer and steak, combined with cost, are what brings this review down. Other than the steak, the food items we received were very good, and I'd definitely eat here again.",

A big issue was the staff; everyone from the hostess to the bussers seemed to not want to be there. Our server was very short with us while ordering and never really came back after that. Another dude brought us our food and he wasn't very friendly either. I burnt my hand pretty badly (it bubbled into a blister the next day) on one of the metal dishes they serve the food (straight from the oven?!?!) in and it took us forever to find someone to give us some ice since our water glasses were never even refilled.  The food was a disappointment as well. The menu was probably half the size of the AZ location so there wasn't much variety. Since it was late we decided on a few small plates to share. We got the corn (cooked well but very bland), the Mac and Cheese (really awful... the sauce was white and curdled) and also the small fried blobs they tried to pass off as tacos.  The decor in the place was nice but it was loud since it is open to the casino and also very dark for some unknown reason. Just not a pleasant experience. There are other better and cheaper places to go in Caesars so I will not be back.",

I originally just wanted to stop in for happy hour but since they had an event going on in the bar area, we stepped in for a full dining experience.  Service was great! Before we met our waiter, another waiter stopped over for drink orders.  He noticed ours was busy with another table and didn't want us to go unnoticed.  Very thoughtful and attentive! During the rest of our meal service was nothing less than excellent.  He was professional and courteous.   We started with the lollipop buffalo wings with the blue cheese fondue.  Well it isn't really fondue so much as it is just a small cup blue cheese dressing.  But the wings are good.  The meat came right off the bone so easily.  Tasty starter for sure.    The delicious meals we ordered were wonderful! I enjoyed the beer braised short ribs served over horseradish potatoes topped with two onion rings.  So tender, flavorful and mouthwatering.  I should have stopped at eating half but it was just too good to stop.    My husband ordered the filet medium rare as usual.  His belief is that a steak should not need any sauce to be good.  Well they nailed it here.  The perfectly cooked steak was before him.  There wasn't any doubt it was good since he cleaned the plate.    Chef Malarkey has done a fine job with Searsucker.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

The name implies Southern food, and I didn't see their normal menu although the food was actual culturally diverse.  Which I was good with as live in the South and didn't want southern food in Vegas.  We had two apps of hummus and himachi.  Both were decent.  The main course had options and I got something like skirt steak which was very good.  There were mashed potatoes and brusse sprouts to share.  I would have never visited just walking by, but I was pleased with my meal going in with less than high expectations.",

They did bring me a steak and crispy potatoes but the steak was a thin, pre-sliced steak with chimichurry sauce and an entire ocean worth of salt. It was disgusting. The crispy potatoes weren't any better, they were drenched in salt and had grilled jalapenos and onions mixed in with parmesean cheese. I don't think the fries would have been too bad if they didn't have so. much. salt.  I was so convinced that they didn't bring me the right dish that I even asked the waiter, who confirmed that it was indeed the drunken steak. I'm still not convinced he didn't mishear me.  The service was mediocre. It took about 10 minutes to get my check after I asked for it.",

The location is kind of a pain to get to if you're a local and parking in Caesars self park. Be prepared for a long walk. Luckily the wait times were reasonable and the ambiance is sort of trendy and fun.   Now on to the stuff that really matters, the food. We opted to try some shareable items to get the most out of our stomachs. To start we had the beef tartare. Amazing! If I had to recommend any one item here it'd be that! The other food was good, but not in comparison to the tartare.   For dessert we got the milk and cookies which was warm and fresh just like mom would make them. I did wish this was a bit more shareable maybe with two milk glasses instead of just one but that's just me being picky.  I definitely want to come back again soon and try more of the shareable options. I noticed they also do birthday songs & dessert which is nice for birthday party groups.",

    "text": "I decided to dine here before seeing Celine Dion (which was canceled that day because she got sick). The menu looked pretty enticing online and I was eager to try a few dishes.   Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. I felt the food was mediocre and overpriced.   I went with small plates so I could sample different things:  Pig ears - I was so excited to see pig ears on the menu. Growing up in Taiwan, pig ears is a common dish where they marinade with Chinese five spice and make it crunchy but not rubbery. I haven't had pig ears for couple of decades so I was looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. The ears were chewy/rubbery and way too salty. I guess if you are drinking beer, this would be good beer bar food. It's not very good on its own.   Calamari steak with chili honey glaze - The server recommended it to me. While the portion is decent and the meat cooked right, the flavor isn't impressive. Maybe it's because I grew up in Taiwan so I'm so used to the sauces that it's nothing new to me. They basically flash fried the calamari steak and the tossed them in some Chinese spicy and sweet sauce that you can buy at 99 Ranch store and call it the day.   Duck fat fries - Tasted just like regular fries. Nothing special.   I was quite disappointed with this experience. If you aren't used to Asian flavors, you might enjoy this place. Otherwise, skip it.",

I drank my fiance's since she was just on the fence.   She ordered the steak, and I got the salmon. Both delish, and the fries in duck fat were delicious.

The only food I really enjoyed was their dessert. I ordered the chocolate croissant with marshmallows (forgot the actual name). It was amazing and very unique.

We went to Searsucker on a Saturday night before a Penn and Teller show.  We started off with the Frites - usually just fries.  But these were other-worldly.  Seasoned perfectly, and fried to perfection.  I went to heaven.  Thinking we were in some carb induced haze, we ordered the sliders after that.  A small bite of perfection.  Thinking we needed some veggies, my dining partner ordered the brussel sprouts and I ordered the heirloom carrots.  We were both blown away again and I can say it's the only time I have ever tasted brussel sprouts and thought they were good.  Like really good.  Back on the protein trail, we ordered the short ribs and this was the coup de gras.  This was easily the best \"small plate\" dinner we have ever had.  The service was also outstanding.  I just wish I was back in Vegas to go again and try more of their tasty food.  Do yourself a favor and get over to Searsucker as fast as you can.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Tonight was our second time at Searsucker. The first time was great, tonight, obviously not.  We moved to Las Vegas for work last year and our families are elsewhere, given that the first time dinner and service were great we decided to come in to \"celebrate\" Thanksgiving since they were offering a special thanksgiving menu.   We sat and our server Gabriel S. Took a while to come by. When he did, we ordered a taste of a wine they had by the bottle and by the glass and he mumbled \"just a taste?\", maybe he hasn't been fully trained in hospitality but people order a taste to see if they like the wine so they can order a bottle. His comment was rude and he paused and waited for an answer so my bf actually told him nicely \"yes, so we can see if we like it, but we're probably gonna get it since we want to order a bottle\". So right off the bat he's starting a 2 top with a $60 bottle of wine. That's clearly not enough for him so he proceeds to ignore us the whole night. We had to pour our wine, had to ask several food runners for salt & pepper; more gravy, etc. The prix fix menu I got was $59 per person for the Thanksgiving Dinner which was also all you can eat. I didn't care to eat more, but he never came to check if I wanted to. My bf ordered a filet mignon with some sides and he never came to see how the meat was cooked; which wasn't actually at the temperate he requested. We waited so long for him to bus our plates that we stacked them and moved them out of place. When he did show up he asked \"anything else from the kitchen?\" Without even looking at us, so we just asked for the check, paid and left.   I was trying to excuse him because it's thanksgiving, but we both work as servers in town and we have worked holidays before and never treat our guests this badly. Aside from the fact that it was also our holiday being far from home and all, and that working in the industry in town means we had a thousand options for a $200 mediocre turkey dinner yet this is where we decided to spend our evening and he didn't even care to try to do his job.",

Casual ambiance with fancy beer food and a ton of carbs so your body can handle the dance and drink throughout the night.  I tried the following:  -Bone Marrow: Massive! Usually with bone marrow, you're fighting over it with the people you're with because you're all sharing one dinky bone. But one order here has 3 massive bones topped with a chutney and tons of crisped brussel sprout leaves.  -Mac n Cheese: I've never seen mac n cheese made with the wheel-shaped pasta that you see in kids' meals. It works though because the cheese sits in between the crevices. And if it wasn't already creamy enough, there's a huge dollop of sour cream on top.  -Sliders: Taste was fine but it was over cooked and too charred.   -Duck Fat Fries: Definitely a must get! I don't how they cook these but every millimeter of the fries are crispy. The ketchup tastes housemade too (not sure if it is).  -Biscuits: My favorite item of the night. You can taste the butter that went into the making of the dough and then top it with more butter. It just gets better and better. It's not extremely flakey but super moist. It comes out piping hot.   Portions are huge. Service was so so. Water was always filled but when we told the server about the over cooked sliders, she didn't offer to take it off the bill. She just said she wish we told her earlier so she could make us a new plate. It wasn't until we told the manager that they compensated us for it.",

    "text": "My friends and I bought tickets to attend the #VegasStrong benefit show at Omnia, and Oliver at the Hakkasan concierge group reached out to me with a dinner deal at Searsucker. $55 a person for either the prix fixe menu, or spend $55 on the a la carte menu. The entrees are around $30ish, so if you get a cocktail and an appetizer or dessert you're pretty much set. The bonus was a bottle of wine for each four people, and expedited entry into Omnia, which is a huge plus because the lines can get pretty crazy.  I don't remember our server's name, but he handled our party of 12 really well. We opted to do family style sharing plates, so he basically just ordered the menu highlights for us and made it work out to $55 a person. I think we probably would've gotten more food if we would have ordered on our own, but I'm much more of a tapas girl so small portions and bigger variety are right up my alley. They were super nice and even brought out different plates for my gluten-intolerant friend. I lost count, but we probably had about a dozen dishes in all.   Highlights were the burrata, scallops and the skirt steak. The beer marinade on the drunken skirt steak is amazing. The calamari was also really good - strip cut instead of rings and tentacles - super tender, with a yummy chili honey glaze. I'm a huge fan of short ribs and had high expectations for theirs, but it wasn't as \"fall apart\" as some other ones I've had. We also had hummus, poke, wings, heirloom carrots, brussels, and the brick chicken - everything was good, just nothing super special. I also had a smoked old fashioned, which was really well done. I wish I would have stirred it first though, because I had a sip that was all smoked maple syrup and almost dropped my glass. But once everything was mixed together the flavors were amazing! We skipped dessert because we had to head into Omnia for the show, but I could've easily put down an ice cream sandwich.   Ambiance wise, the restaurant was packed, not a ton of room between tables. EDM music is blasting; I assume because of their partnership with Omnia. Luckily for me that's right up my alley, but it's loud enough that I couldn't hear my friend two seats away. If you're going for dinner and convo, this probably isn't the place for you. But overall, I think it's a decently priced place on the strip with good food, and a great place to grab drinks and small bites before a night out.",

Didn't say a word just put it on the table smiled and walked away. Which we both thought was a little weird.  And it was extremely loud.  Nothing really stood out, just another spot.

My friend ordered the tomato soup which was cold and the salad was so salty as well. I complained to the waitress and she could not care less and never came back to ask us if we liked another drink.

Food--We ordered 4 small dishes since there are so many yummy choices and also highly recommended by the waiter.  -tuna tartar: excellent dish we might come back just for this. -bacon pork belly: it's served on a piece of toast and topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce (egg Benedict style). Overall it's good however we couldn't overlook the fatty layers. -short rib: it's basically s piece of roast beef, served on bed of mashed potato and topped with shredded fried onions. The roast beef is very bland.  -bone marrow: would not recommend this dish. The amount of bone marrow wasn't enough to spread on 4 pieces of baguettes. It's extremely fatty. I'm not sure how to justify the price on bones that otherwise get thrown away. The bed of toast Brussel sprouts were burned.   The habanero coriander pickles are very pickle-y. Pickle lovers would totally enjoy it. Thanks for the free Yelp checkin offer!!  Overall the experience would have been a lot better if we didn't order the fatty dishes (visible fat and running oil). The room temperature was soooo cold that having fat in the palette just didn't work.",

I absolutely loved the crab and avocado but that's about it. Beef tartare came up short, as did the tuna tartare and honestly the rest of the food was so mediocre I can't even remember what else we ordered.

Our waiter was good although he 'disappeared' several times and we had to request assistance from the table attendants when we wanted anything. They were kind and each time said they would tell our waiter. I would have preferred the waiter to have checked in more regularly especially in a restaurant trying to promote a 'social' restaurant format. If we had not been experienced in social dining and got help from the table attendants we would not have had a good experience. Last, the hostess. She was offensive, rude, and incompetent. First we confirmed the restaurant had availability using Open Table. Then we called the restaurant as a courtesy to the restaurant since we were a large group of 10. She seemed to struggle with whether they could accommodate us 'since they are a social restaurant'. Really? Then she says they need an hour and a half to seat us. Really? Then, when we arrive, she looks right over my head and asks if she can help the man standing behind me. Unfortunately for her, that man was my husband and we have had enough of that kind of rude behavior from service industry employees. She didn't stop there but I will. Her behavior is enough to not go back to the restaurant. Too bad because social dining is fun and the food was very good.",

    "text": "Originally it was a review in Seven magazine that sparked my interest in this spot, so I decided to check it out myself to see if it lived up to the hype. It met every expectation and more!   We were 20 minutes late for our reservation but called ahead to let them know and were seated right away (this could have been attributed to the fact that it was a relaxed Sunday night and wasn't super busy). The menus were pretty simple in that they didn't necessarily list all the ingredients in each dish. This was done to invoke questions and a more interactive experience, according to the server. Our server, Alyssa, was incredibly knowledgable and accurate in her descriptions of the menu items, and after much deliberation, we decided on:  -Duck fat fries with prosciutto bits (an absolute must- very flavorful) -Cowboy caviar (Rocky Mountain oysters with toasted kale and sweet potato with a balsamic drizzle- my favorite part of the meal!) -Pork butt with whiskey apples (melt in your mouth goodness) -Warm toffee pumpkin pudding cake (we didn't think we would have enough room for dessert but we're glad we ordered it!)  The dishes were as simplistic in their delivery as the menu had been, yet were still presented beautifully on each plate. This is not a restaurant that makes you question your knowledge of which fork to use- rather, it's a relaxed, inviting atmosphere where the servers are as unpretentious as the dishes themselves. Each bite was delicious, and the overall experience left you feeling happy and fulfilled. Would definitely return!",

Overall, an amazing experience for is and our bachelorette group of 12.  Also, from the bachelorette party organizers, this place is perfect for flexibility of a large party and also lets you count drinks toward the max (which some places done).   So good!!",

Bar was really good and the service was friendly I definitely recommend",

The beef tartar was also good. It could have used more quail egg.   My boyfriend and I split the Tomahawk ribeye. I was so excited for this, but it was lackluster. Especially for an $85 steak. I found it to be tough and too fatty. And to the smart ass (Erik S) who called out that I should get a clue about a ribeye being fatty, I understand that the fat is what makes a ribeye delicious but when half the steak is fat I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I've had plenty of ribeye steaks that are more meaty. My review, my opinion.   My friend had the pork belly entree and said the flavors were good, but it was too rich to eat more than half of it. Pork belly is rich so you have to be in the mood for it.   This place is worth a try, but I'm not running back.",

Side of Jalapeno-chorizo corn off the cob - this was tasty but again was probably over spiced  Duck with white bean, confit, and fig - The meat was overcooked and incredibly  tough and the rest of the dish was bland.

Our group of 30 was sat a two large tables in a partially private area. We started with the lollipop wings, ahi tuna tacos and calamari steak. WOW. The lollipop wings were amazing, the heat on them was seriously perfect. I loved the way they were trimmed too, the least messy wings I have ever encountered. For my entree I got the steak that came with a roasted pepper. There were brussels sprouts for sharing as well. The steak was seasoned perfect, I ordered mine medium and it was a tad under, I didn't eat the center because it was a bit too purple for me, but that's personal preference. For dessert we had the assorted cakes and chocolate chip cookies, these were probably the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. I'm not a huge sweets person but I ate 3. THREE.   The service during dinner was great as well.   Prior to planning the dinner the event staff was awesome! They were always quick to respond to any questions I had, adjusted our time when I arrived late for the event and were accommodating when a guest didn't want anything from the preset menu. Thank you so much for a great evening!!",

For me they brought the pork belly...delicious!!! 2nd round they unfortunately brought her another salad...not the ideal place for vegetarians I must say, nonetheless, the 2nd salad had figs and goat cheese and greens with a delicious dressing...she said it was excellent, I liked it too! With the delicious, spicy bread balls we had initially, we were already feeling full, so she canceled her main course and we split the tuna. My vegetarian girlfriend loved it! lol I also really enjoyed it! Sushi grade with the skin attached...really tasty! Overall, a great restaurant...highly recommend!",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite meal in Vegas! Take my advice, and go to this place around 5-6pm. They have a great happy hour menu.  I've had a lot of burgers in my life, and this HAS to be the best I've had. Upgrade to the duck fat fries for a dollar, trust me you won't regret that extra dollar.  This place is A++ in my book and would highly recommend it. For you whiskey drinkers, get the \"Bad Bad.\" All in all, this place is fairly pricey, but if you go during the happy hour menu, you won't pay through the nose for a fantastic meal.",
