I am not sure if the relocation of the restaurant has caused the service to go down hill, but it was the worse. Our waitress took our order in a rush, had someone else drop it off, and brought the bill right after. Never checked to see how we were doing or anything.   I have no complaints towards the food, since it was delicious. Last time I got Andy's safe fried chicken farm Benedict, and it amazing. The fried chicken and Benedict had a great transition of flavors.   This time I got the the farm scrambler with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado. Very delicious and exceptional.   The food is amazing, but the service sucks. Gave it 4 stars because the food is so good.",

I don't know if cooking it properly would have helped, but I found it bland and dry. The toppings were good though on the skimpy side.   A small warning...they put a couple of huge nasty pickle slices on it without warning. Now if you like pickles, you're fine. However if like me, you consider pickle juice to taste like the sewers in the seventh level of hell, you will want to ask them to skip it. The juice tainted everything.   My wife had the waffle, which she said was simple but tasty enough.   Service was very friendly and she gave us lots of attention and refills.   As an amusing side note, the check had our bottle of Pellegrino spelled as \"Periglino.\"",

We also had a take on a Reuben sandwich for lunch that was really tasty. The sweet potato fries were great.  Service: the lunch was a let down. A completely unfriendly water who seemed mildly annoyed he had to take our orders. Not very attentive and very long wait for the food. He also tried to fill up my Sprite with ice water until I very quickly put my hand over the glass. The breakfast service was just fine though.

The waitress said the Rye bread tastes different because they add in 'different things', tasted like stale vinegar.

I still don't know what was going on, maybe it was just this one place but the waitress defended it and sad it's supposed to taste this way.

We got two orders of the basic breakfast combo which came with 2 eggs of any style, mashed or crispy potatoes, bacon or sausage, biscuit and fruits. The mashed potatoes were horrible. Their was weird crumbs all over and they burned them too, which I dont get why they would burn it in the first place.

    "text": "We met out of state friends there this morning. The Carnival buffet was not open, so they were looking for a restaurant (not a bar that served food) to take us to breakfast. When we saw the Hash House, I said, \"oh, I have heard great things about them and they just opened one not far from our house. I've never been to any of them, but they say they are very good\" . Bite my tongue.  Naturally, it was very noisy. Two people ordered coffee, one with cream. When she added the cream, it curdled in the coffee. She showed the coffee to a server and asked for a fresh cup. Apparently, they just poured out the old and used the same cup to add fresh and bring her a different container of cream because there was coffee on the side of the cup.  Things went down hill from there.  One person asked if it was possible to get an omlette and the server said, no, but they did have \"scrambles...and there wasn't any real difference\". Hmmmm. He ordered the pancake, which WAS huge, but was unappealing because it did not fit on the plate and was not cooked in the center. The other 3, including myself, ordered a form of the \"scrambled\". hmmmm. Either the eggs were powdered or they had been in the refrigerator waaay tooo long and had an off taste. Also, nothing was hot.  I was greatly embarrassed. Oh, and did I mention that the cost was, well, above average for a breakfast place? Oh, that's right...it was in a hotel, so it's ok to jack up the prices.",

For a place named 'Hash House' you would expect hash to be served, not hash ingredients without the necessary chopping and prepping. My husband was so disappointed. I ordered Eggs, Potatoes, & Pancakes for $16.00. The excuse for the price is that the pancakes are huge. They are. They have good flavor but are rubbery and far too large. The potatoes are large cubes cooked crispy on all sides, covered in seasoned salt, and tossed with raw green onions.  I guess the idea is to make the food artsy but it just feels and tastes like the cooks are lazy.",

Once I scraped off a majority of the sauce it was pretty good, but I would not order that benedict again.

What I really like, though, is the way the food is prepared. They use lots of herbs to make things taste good! Lots of dishes have a sprig of rosemary in the center and you can taste it in the food. Also, some dishes are prepared in ways that you may not expect. The bacon waffles are just that.  It's like they laid a piece of bacon on the waffle iron and poured batter over it. Don't be surprised. Our party ordered the chicken and waffle plate, an omelet, a pancake and a hash plate. We really liked it all. I deducted one star only because it did take some time for the food to come out on a weekend around midday.",

Crispy like French friends and the insides weren't too soft. I couldn't stop eating them. Damn you carbs!!  OVERALL: 5/5.

I don't really know how to describe this but something about this dish taste ALMOST delicious, it's pretty lackluster. It's like there's too much something and not enough of something. My expression the whole time eating it's really to figure out how to describe the dish - i really like to see this place improve, I think the only thing that makes this place stand out is the huge portion and the presentation. The flavors are really lacking.   I'd like to give this place a try again next time I visit Vegas",

    "text": "After a week of really tough night shifts, my senior resident and I decided to have breakfast at Hash House A Go Go. There are several locations, and we opted for the location inside Rio since it was off the Strip while still being relatively close to work.  It was my first time inside Rio, and I must say that the restaurant was bigger than I was expecting. My dining companion said she had been to a different standalone location, and that this Rio location had a more \"industrial\" feel, plus the ceilings and floor were probably dictated by the constraints of the resort this location is located in.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the locomotive train near the entrance, and felt like this was a very spacious dining atmosphere. It was also not too busy at 7AM on a Friday morning. We had several people serve us during the meal, refilling water, clearing plates, bringing out our food, so I don't think we had a clearly defined waiter. However, everyone from the hostess to the runners were super friendly and attentive.  As for the food, I love waffles so I ordered the sage chicken and waffles. The number one thing that stands out is the MASSIVE portion size. I can eat a lot, but these entrees are definitely enough for two people if you eat even an average amount for meals. My sage chicken came with two full fried thigh pieces plus four square waffles. The presentation of the dish had a lot of pizzaz, with a giant knife stuck vertically in the stack like a dagger (see attached photo).   The dish was excellent. Some of the waffles were a bit on the soggy side; not too soft but just not as crispy as I prefer. I was also surprised to see several segments of bacon INSIDE my waffles! Bacon inside waffle batter inside of as a garnish; that was a first for me! However, the chicken was tender and juicy, and the herb flavors permeated the chicken meat; perhaps it was marinated in herb water prior to frying. I definitely could have finished the entire dish if I pushed myself, but I ended up taking two of the waffles home as leftovers.  My dish cost almost $20 before tax, but given the humongous portion size, it's definitely reasonable. With the open air atmosphere despite being indoors, friendly service, and tasty food with good value, I think Hash Hash A Go Go is a solid breakfast/brunch choice! =)",

Not because the service wasn't excellent - but because it just didn't seem to the meet the expectations (food wise) that we were accustomed to from the restaurant.   They're basically known for their huge portions, but they seem to have cut down on that. I neglected to take a picture, but the healthy scramble I ordered with salmon and spinach was so dinky, it was like a side portion. I was still hungry after I finished everything on my plate except the melon pieces. Oh, and I ordered (and paid for) goat cheese to be added on my scramble. I am positive there was none. I hate complaining at restaurants though and wanted to start my morning on a positive note (we had just arrived in Las Vegas from driving since 12 am and hadn't even checked in yet - we were both exhausted) so I didn't say anything. So, whatever.  But we ate at the bar to get around the ridiculous line, and the bartender was super nice and speedy. My mimosa was strong - I couldn't finish it that early in the morning, haha. Loved it!  My BF ordered some kind of chicken steak dish, as can be seen in the photo. It is beautiful how they arranged it, but still smaller than what we've ordered in the past. Oh well, it is still an alright breakfast place.",

It's a mountain of chicken on a mountain of waffles! The chicken is tender and easy to cut with the waffle for a truly delicious bite! The kicker is there's bacon baked right inside the middle of the waffles! The Housemade Hash was hearty and flavorful, as well. Either way, you can't go wrong. Hours are limited, so check it out and plan accordingly. We had a group of ten and there was another group of ten, as well. They do their best to accommodate everyone as quickly as possible.",

I had heard great things about the crazy combinations and fun atmosphere so I offered it up as an option.   We were seated promptly upon arrival. It was a Friday morning so there wasn't a large amount of people. We were brought drinks and soon greeted by a waitress. She explained the menu to us so we could better understand what they had to offer. We each settled on a different type of scramble (all looked amazing). Everything was seasoned well and the variety of colors used really made the plate pop. I will say however that the biscuit that they serve with the scrambles were GIANT, but dry. I would recommend artery clogging amounts of butter if you are going to eat it. Other than that we had a great experience. I would definitely go back and maybe even try their lunch menu!",

I decided to give this place a second chance. Boy was I wrong to come back again.  I don't even remember the name of the plate I ordered but I wish I hadn't ordered it. My dish was suppose to be some type of omlette with avocados, onions and cheese. I actually thought the avocados would be on the side but it was actually cooked in the omlette with the cheese. Honestly the plate came out on the sour side and it wasn't eatable at all. Super unhappy with what I ordered and from what I recall from my San Diego visit...it was super plain as well. NOT impressed this second time around and don't think I will be going to any more Hash House A Go Gos going forward. The food here is really mediocre and SUPERRR overhyped. I still don't see what the hype is about. THE FOOD IS SUPER BLAND. I suggest spending your money on the strip where the foods 10x better or going off strip for local foods.

I was truly disappointed because I love their food and service.  I ordered what I usually order during brunch, sage fried chicken Benedict.  The food came out in 5 minutes from ordering it.  This only means one thing to me, it wasn't freshly made.  As soon as we dove into our food, you can't tell it wasn't fresh.  The food was cold, the breading on the chicken was hard as a rock, and the chicken was even more dead than usual and dry.  I really like my food that's supposed to be hot, HOT.  When you go to a restaurant there's a few basic expectations that were not fulfilled this visit.  Our server wasn't as friendly or attentive as I'd expect either.  I'm sure we will go back to Hash House, not sure we will be back to the one in the Rio.",

I've never heard of this place before and I saw the posters that Guy Fieri and Martha Stewart endorse the place as their favorite restaurant. Which makes you think that this must be a great place.   What makes the place really awesome is the service. Like, the staff there were so awesomely nice and very attentive. Honestly, I'm probably more a fan of their service than their food.   So, what they are known for is their Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and their large portions. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. It was ok, the chicken was very greasy. I didn't even get to finish half of my meal. It was a meal ready to feed about 3 people. Honestly, I wished that I was able to take it home, however I was from out of town and my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator nor a microwave.   I'm not sure why Martha Stewart would endorse this place for the food. However, for the service, I honestly agree with her. As for Guy Fieri, I feel that he endorse anything. But, something about the food lacked a lot of loving.   The reason I'm rating this 4 stars is because of the service, and the experience was great there. My advice for anyone who is coming there to have brunch is... be ready to eat a lot (like buffet style hungry) and wear your looses pants.  Happy Eating.",

The waiter said \"it was coming\". It seemed like he was avoiding us. The rest of us had finished our meals and still no order in sight. Finally we had to flag our waiter to talk to the manager. The manager was not very apologetic. He was justifying the problem by saying they ran out of chicken. They should have been honest w/ us as soon as our food started coming out or when they first realized in the kitchen. We would have been understanding and happily ordered something else. Working in customer service, you want your customers to walk out feeling at least satisfied even if there was a problem. The manager didn't offer anything to make us feel better except that he'll take the chicken and waffle meal off our order...which is a given since we never got it. It's very disappointing when you walk out of a business feeling upset and frustrated. I felt bad for my friend who never got his meal. Hopefully this review will help improve their customer service or possibly they don't care like how we felt.",

We enjoyed our specialty lattes of frosty mint and smores. The ham, spinach, and cheddar scrambled eggs were satisfying paired with roasted potatoes and fruit. All the dishes were a large portion. The highlight the meal was without a doubt the French toasted which may be the BEST French toast we have ever had. Service was fast and friendly. They were very attentive at making sure we had what we needed and were enjoying our meal.",

I also ordered the s'mores drink and it was really pretty. It was pretty pricey but worth all the food. The decor of the place is so cool (all those celebrity autographs!!) and the place is spacious.

On our last morning there we were going to head to the buffet for breakfast but learned the buffet only opens for breakfast on the weekends now.  So the only other place to eat breakfast is the Hash House where their old coffee shop used to be.  We were seated quickly.  The food was ok.  Large portions, but the taste was just ok, nothing great.  I know there are different locations throughout Vegas and people always said you should check it out.  Now that I did, I wasn't really impressed.  I had biscuits and gravy and one of my friends had the waffle.  I can't remember what the others had, but all of us walked away from there saying it wasn't great.  Overall, I would give the service a B and the food a C.  I guess it comes down to this...would I recommend this to someone?  My answer would be no.",

A lot of waiting from entering, someone to take our orders, getting our food. I asked one server if they have creamers and he said they only have what's on the table. Then he followed it up bu saying we dont have other creamers so you want coffee or not. I said no thank you and Me and my niece just laugh. Some feisty server huh!  The snickers pancakes were good also the eggs and sausage but the mushroom hash has all potatoes  very very few pieces of mushrooms which was the reason i ordered that dish. Mushroom hash! I talked to a manager who kindly helped us with an empty ketchup and suggested to him about adding more mushrooms in the hash because that's the name of the dish and he said he will take care of me and I thought he will come back with some more mushrooms. 20-30 mins gone by, nothing. Over promised under delivered service. For the price per dish that we pay you would thought you will be come out very happy of hash hash ago go. Come for the thrill of humongous food not the service not really about the goodness of the food. There's other places better in this area if that's what you're looking for.",

But it didn't meet my expectations! 4 of us shared the most famous dishes from here: chicken and waffle, sage chicken, and chicken pot pie. It didn't taste horrible, the flavor was typical and as expected from fried chicken and waffle, the sage chicken was just just biscuit and bacon and fried chicken. Chicken pot pie was a little too dry and thick. The presentation for all three dishes were perfect and jaw dropping, however, what's most important is the taste of the food right??   Once again, it's not that it was bad, it just tasted typical. Food was heavy and all four of us felt sick after the meal.  The portions were huge so it's big enough to share one dish to two people which is awesome but the cost isn't low so I guess it evens out.",

The real star here are the potatoes under the hash though. Perfectly seasoned with a mixture of spices that really made them pop. The biscuits weren't very good though. It might be because we're from the south and we know good biscuits, but they were just not buttery and flakey enough. I do like the addition of fruits that came with it. Solid four stars.",

I ask if made fresh they say yes, liars should be closed down. The food and service is always a joke, only good service I get is from the super cute Russian red head at the bar.

Well this is what it looks like: we are hotel guests and one guy is still in the room sleeping at high noon so we narrow our choices to something in the hotel. We don't want to take the car and ditch the guy so we go to HHaGG. I had a one pound stuffed burger my friend chose something totally different but I cant remember what exactly - probably some breakfast or bacon waffle?  I get my burger. Presentation is great. A piece of rosemary is sticking out the top of the bun and holds it all together beautifully. Before I can get my rosemary branch out I hear noises from across the table. Its my friend. Hes going to town. Really enjoying it. Hes either really hungry or its really good. Nom, nom, nom... it won't quit.   At this point I'm expecting the most awesome burger ever -- great presentation and  my friend's food is so good he wont stop eating to take a breath. I bite in and I'm not impressed. I don't like the bread or the meat... Nothing is super. I eat most of it until I can't eat any more. I leave a bunch on my plate and hope they take it away fast so I don't have to stare at my wasteful leftovers.   At this point my friend is mopping up the syrup with the last of his whatever he ordered and licks his fingers clean.  Ok, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing... But for this trip it was just ok. If it weren't for that bum friend of ours I would have eaten at Buffet Bellagio as noon is a great time to go becasue the line isn't horrible yet.",

The pluses were the coffee was hot, there was a ton of food one (I should have split my order with one of my friends) and the prices were ok. The minus were the service, very slow unfortunately I feel that the RIO location has a lot to do with that since poor service is common at this area. I'm just not a fan of their food I had the meat loaf hash and I thought it was so greasy and flavorless at the same time. Why they used a mozzarella cheese on it is beyond me it does not add any flavor. The hash was super soggy.",

This was maybe our 5th or 6th visit as we make sure to come every time we are in Vegas.  We LOVE this place! They are known for their giant portions, but what's even better than large food....FANTASTIC food!! I went to my go to and had the chicken and waffles...AGAIN, and just like all the other times, FANFREAKINGTASTIC!!!! My husband had the eggs, bacon, and pancake, and he loved it. The banana French toast was out of this world delicious, my 16 year old at every last bite! And the BBBLT, well it didn't disappoint my bacon loving 13 year old who can never seem to get enough bacon.  We were dehydrated from our Vegas shenanigans so we all drank our weight in water which they kept full at all times. We did order a cup of hot cocoa and not only was it super tasty, it was giant and took 3 of us to finish! The only negative I have about this restaurant is that it's only open for breakfast and brunch and closes at 3. We really wanted to have dinner there, but didn't have the energy to go back to the strip and we were staying at the Rio. Thank you Hash House A Go Go for another fantastic meal. See ya next time!",

Our waitress was attentive and helpful the whole time.  We were surprised with 4 Mothers's Day desserts which was very sweet of the kitchen.  Overall, it was a bitter Mother's Day morning but end up sweet. Thanks Chef Chee from Carnival Buffet and both Managers at HHAGG worked together to give us a great Mother's Day breakfast.",

We opted for the fried chicken benny with a side of biscuits and gravy. Way too much food for me alone, so I'm glad the bf and I split. The Benny consisted of a bed of mashed potatoes, topped with a biscuit, tomatoes, spinach, fried chicken, poached eggs and topped with hollandaise. The chicken was flavorful and the batter was crisp.The biscuits were moist and the gravy added a good richness. My in laws ordered the eggs with sausage and the corn beef hash. They enjoyed their meal as well. FYI, coffee is $4. So make sure you get your money's worth and get refills like I did. I probably had about 5 cups. I was wired, very full and happy.   P.S. I think our waiter'a name is Peter. He was patient and friendly. Awesome job!",

I tried to go for lunch the day before, but restaurant closes at 1pm most days (they do brunch on weekends). Seriously, I thought if there was anywhere I was sure to find all day breakfast this was it, but no.  Menu is full of your breakfast standards and some signature spins on same. I got The Basic - 2 egg breakfast with sausage and biscuit. I wanted white toast but I was told they don't carry that. (What???) Eggs and sausage were acceptable. Potatoes were overdone, tasted of old fryer grease and took up 3/4 of plate. Biscuit was dry. Because of the potatoes, the portion was massive.   And honestly, what is with the massive inedible Rosemary garnish? It doesn't add to the visual appeal of the dish, nor does it visually signify to you that there is Rosemary in the dish. I thought it was wasteful.  Prices were Vegas standard...about $40 for two with coffee and OJ.",

When I asked the server to have them make me different eggs, the cook sent out eggs so runny she had to bring them in a bowl. Even the server knew that was wrong and asked if they were \"too easy\"? Finally on the third attempt they got them right, but by then it wasn't just the toast that was cold, all of my breakfast was cold. My husband ordered biscuits and gravy with the mashed potatoes. Biscuits & his eggs (also ordered over easy) were good, but the potatoes looked like a big pile of mush.  We should've known it would go this way after waiting  to get a table. Several employees walked by us telling us \"someone will be right with you\". No one ever was. I finally had to go find someone to get us a table. Don't waste your time or money here",

    "text": "Being a big fan of chicken and waffles this place was first on my radar and maybe I should have stuck to that when we finally stopped in? Or maybe it was the fact that we stopped in during dinner time? As you can see were still trying to make sense of what exactly was going on here it's like we stepped into something mirroring the Twilight zone. We should have taken a hint that upon entering, the place didn't smell particularly like the delicious food it claims to serve. Drinks were overpriced and tiny and the prices for the food are a little up there , but hey, it's Vegas what can you do- the plates are extravagant and extra for no reason. You're paying for their expensive decor because the food is not quality.   This place had such a hype around it we were expecting something magical. Not even 10 minutes had gone by when we had received our food. I guess that would have been warning number 2 since we didn't exactly order just the salad on the menu. The day old left overs in my fridge tasted better than the food that was served. It wasnt fresh... it was extremely bland and even with the help of salt nothing changed. My potatoes were not cooked recently, don't know how long they had been sitting around but they weren't crispy nor did they taste like anything. Yeah they put my skillet in the oven and maybe my eggs were fresh out of the bottle but that's it. Their was fruit on my plate but that must have went in the oven too because it was hot when I tried to eat it. Boop suffered food poisoning after that dinner which effected her for another couple days afterwards. She played it safe and got a simple burger, but aparently not even that was safe enough. The serving sizes were ginormous though, maybe that's what you're paying for.... Only able to stomach less than a forth of the plate we left unsatisfied.  Just save yourself the dissapointment and the stomach ache that goes along with it. Or maybe stick to what their more popular dishes are ? Either way, their are plenty of other breakfast spots in the area.",

The food is good, and plentiful, and bounteous, and dang, that's a lot of food!  This HHaGG is in the RIO All Suites, and a bit nearer to the Convention side of the house compared to the Hotel side of the house. It's right next to the bigger Starbucks, also inside the RIO.  The restaurant has a clean and happy vibe.  The bathrooms are a bit of a hike away, so you may want to wash your hands before getting in line for a seat.  I ordered the Salmon Benedict, and it was lovely with one oddity. There were these crunchy straws that sort-of resembled burnt hay, and once I removed them, the dish was one of the best Bennies I'd ever had!",

On a positive point the coffee is fresh and about the best diner coffee you can buy, at $4.  Nice decor and clean restaurant. Now the bad.  For $45 for two people I expect good quality homemade food. If I wanted Dennys or IHOP I would go there. I ordered corned beef hash and found some deep fried  potatoes sprinkled with some microwaved corned beef shreds. My scrambled eggs were not scrambled, but are out of a bag and baked or something, yes I am a chef, I know the difference between fresh and bagged eggs. Your biscuit mix comes out of a box and you add water. The gluten development is weak, there is no butter flavor,and just sucks.  Please make some biscuits from scratch.

    "text": "When the plates arrived my first thought was \"that is a lot of food on that platter\". My second thought was \"why is there a pine tree in my food?\".  Other reviewers were not exaggerating about the portions. Our breakfasts actually came on what would be considered a serving platter. I recommend sharing a meal with one or two other people. I had one of the scrambles which came with their fried mashed potatoes and a biscuit. This was my first time trying fried mashed potatoes and thought they were good, but not amazing. I think that the same can be said for the rest of the meal. One of my friends had the sage chicken and waffles and the other had the biscuits and gravy. We were all in agreement that everything was good to fine. I think sometimes quantity does not equal quality. I also thought it was pricey for breakfast food, but granted maybe not for the portion. I think I would have preferred a smaller portion anyway.   Hash House has several fun drink options, both alcoholic, such as their different types of mimosas and bloody marts, and virgin, such as their watermelon kiwi lemonade. Again, this is Vegas, so most of the prices were high.  Random complaint: the restaurant is open to the casino, meaning there is not a wall between the hall and the restaurant, only a railing. We were seated next to the railing. There was a long line waiting for the restaurant that queued against the railing and our table. It was a bit awkward to eat with someone standing next to you waiting with their elbow a foot away from your food.",

There was a pretty long line when we got to the restaurant, but it moved pretty quickly.  The one really annoying thing was that there was also a line to pay after you ate (you don't pay with your server) and that line moved very slowly.  At some times, that line was 20 people or more long, so expect a wait to get in and another wait to pay.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge for some things, especially pancakes.  I got one of the scrambles and the portion was an average size for that.  It was ok but nothing unique.  It also came with home fries and a biscuit.  The potatoes could have been crispier and needed more seasoning.  The outside of the biscuit was very dry and hard to eat.  The meal filled me up but did not leave me wanting to come back here.   One of my friends also ordered a scramble and was given the wrong dish.  It took them a while to bring the correct food, which was frustrating.  My other friend ordered the corned beef hash.  I had a bite of it and it was tasty but very salty.  The food was definitely overpriced for what it was, but given that this was in a hotel in Vegas, it's kind of expected.",

The only thing is the sage herb - I felt like it was a little overdone and I'm not a huge fan of herbs and it would've tasted just as good without it. Hopefully you can ask them to add less sage ! I only finished one chicken lol they give you two huge pieces   My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict which didn't look like one but it was sooo delicious and huge! It's just a bunch of good stuff put together like eggs, mashed potatoes, etc. He also didn't finish his portion",

Food: Good - We ordered their chicken and waffles (can't remember the name of it at the moment) which was about $18-$19. It fed 2-3 people and was large. There were two chicken thighs and four bacon waffles. The chicken thighs were crispy on the outside and tasted like honey, but there was very little seasoning once you got past the skin. - The waffles were decent and I definitely felt like my blood sugar was going to go up from all the honey and syrup on the plate. I definitely got my savory and sweet breakfast.  Location/Seating: Decent - Very easy to find once you're at the hotel. We just followed the signs and asked a few people when we wanted faster directions. - Plenty of seating. We came at 10am, was a party of 6, and we're seated immediately. - A line started to form closer to lunch   Overall, the place was decent. I wouldn't come back here on my own since I wasn't crazy about the food  and it's pretty expensive. However, this would be a good place to bring people to for the \"WOW\" factor since the quantity is over the top!",

It's bitter -- even with two sugars and three creams, it was bitter. I usually have a 12-oz. cup with 1 cream and 1 sugar!  On the positive side, our waitress replaced the original cup with one she made, to which she added hot water!  The portions are huge. My bacon and eggs were perfectly made, although the potatoes were not hot.  My husband declared his mushroom hash \"very tasty,\" adding that the sun-dried tomatoes really made the dish.   Finally, the prices are sky high!  If you're watching your purse strings, opt for a place outside the complex.",

After a 20 min wait,  yes open tables everywhere. ..it doesn't seem like it would be hard to figure out that the resturant needs extra staff during the world series of poker. ..but who knows...we were finally seated. We asked the hostess  if we could sit in the booth, there were two open at the end of a bank of six. .no!  She rudely said.  That section is closed.  Who the hell divides a section on the middle of a bank of booths?  And seriously that doesn't make sense to a customer who sees booths open and is offered a crappy table. Ok.  Fine crappy table.  Then the people in line behind us were seated next to us at another crappy table. ..however they had a waitress. ..ours didn't make an appearance.  They got coffee,  we got coffee. ..they had their order taken and when they said to their waitress that we were first in line and if she could take our order she said that's  not my section. She takes their order and left us to our own freaking twilight zone section.  Finally I had to get up and ask the hostess to please send someone to take or order since 10 mins had now passed. And once the waiter did arrive he was very nice,  making recommendations. .etc...but there is something wonky in a system where waists disappear for so long.  Then my dish came out and I can honestly say it was a little disgusting.  The nice smoked salmon was actually a big chunk of fatty grossness...an inch thick salmon fat steak on a biscuit. Ick.  So between the wait,  the rough start and the questionable quality ingredients (ps, a cup of coffee is $3.99..and I don't know if they're just taking the farmhouse theme a little too far but it is burned, dirty and truly not worth the investment) I'm going to say...don't waste your time on this place.",

This portion was also large, I probably could've eaten just the biscuit and been full.

My husbands french toast came with a grilled banana on top with pecans , it was delicious and a nice surprise. The service was fast it may have been like 10 minutes after we ordered that our food was at the table which was surprising because the restaurant was busy. Will definitely be back to try out something else on the menu!",

    "text": "Food: The food portions are huge! The pancakes were the size of steering wheels. I split the sage fried chicken and waffle with my friend. Just when I thought the meal couldn't be any more unhealthy, my friend pointed out there was BACON inside the waffles. Mind blown. The chicken i felt was pretty average and not as flavorful as I imagined. Waffles tasted like regular waffles with bacon inside. It wasn't spectacular and I feel like it was over-hyped. I think the size of the meals are the shock factor, frankly not the food itself.  Service: We had to wait for 20 min before getting a seat, which was a way better wait time than the other Hash location we tried out first. Our table decided to play some Keno. It was really funny because 5 people played and when the chosen numbers came out, the server came to stop by and see if any of us won anything. She said, \"nope\" \"not today\" \"none for you\" ... it was hilarious.",

They could have checked with us to see if we wanted something else since the fried chicken was going to be a while. They didn't comp anything or try to make it better. The only thing they did was to tell us they can get us something else. Absolutely horrible customer service/hospitality. I would go to a different location because the service is probably better.",

What I did pick was an old standby, a staple of the breakfast that could be done so many ways and many of them not well.  I ordered the oatmeal breakfast. I figured it wasn't a giant tray of food. It would be hot and come pretty quickly. Well, it was hot and did come pretty quickly but I was wrong if I thought that it wasn't going to be huge. They brought out a trough of oatmeal. I wish I was kidding but I'm not. I talked into that bowl for a good 20 minutes and hardly made a dent. Along with the bowl of oatmeal, there were many fresh fruits, types of sugars, and dried fruits and nuts. It was probably one of the best bowls of oatmeal I'd ever had. If you're running from place to place while in Vegas and you need to grab something for breakfast, I recommend the oatmeal because it came very quickly to my table. It was steel cut oats so it must have been ready in the kitchen. Hash House a go go do that and inspiring job on an otherwise uninspiring dish.",

Had to wait around til we had almost finished the food before the server came to bring us butter and jam for the biscuits. However when it arrived the jam was great. Definitely not store bought, very good. Pleasant dining experience",

We planned to eat breakfast there the next morning with our crew and I eagerly looked up the menu online and planned out which delectable dish I would get.   Well, that didn't work out. While the website shows an updated and exciting menu, this location still had the old one. That was disappointing in itself.   We also had pretty slow service. Granted, we had a sort of large party with 4 adults and 4 kids but it wasn't so huge as to merit the slowness we experienced.   Food came out and while it was still big portions, things have definitely changed. The biscuits were different, and not a good different. They were kind of dry and blah. Nobody really liked their food. It was not nearly as good as we had remembered. We left wishing we had just gone to the buffet.",

    "text": "Went with my husband for breakfast celebrating our one year anniversary. We've been to the one on Stephanie before and loved it! When we arrived, there was no wait. Atmosphere was very lively. Our waiter Greg took our drink orders right away. We both ordered glasses of water along with our juice and lemonade. We never received the water we asked for. Once food was ordered, we waited a while. Service was slow and non existent after we placed our orders. Once our food arrived, we did not see Greg again. My husband ordered the Texas El Ranchero and enjoyed it! It was well seasoned and freshly made. I ordered the chicken hash for the first time. Although I was extremely excited for it as it did look amazing, the meal was disappointing. The chicken was dry and bland, no flavor. My potatoes weren't crispy although they looked it. Possibly were reheated? The asparagus was crunchy, but also lacked in flavor. My eggs were not seasoned and I asked for cheese, which was missing. Unfortunately, it was hard for me to enjoy my meal with out Ranch, salsa, or any other condiment that would help balance out the dryness of the chicken and potatoes. Next time we saw Greg was when he brought the check. I understand it was a little busy, but not being checked on once is pretty inconsiderate. The people in the booth behind us sat there with a hand raised for minutes before someone came to assist him, with multiple waiters walking around. I'm sure this may not speak to the place as a whole, but when you're paying a decent price for the food, I personally would expect a better experience. I think we'll stick with the location on Stephanie from now on.",

The food was great, except the service was subpar. Our server was pushy at the start about drinks and ordering right away when we first sat down. Once we ordered, 1/2 the table was served and the other 1/2 had to wait an extra 15 minutes for our food. The server had to check on our food twice to see if it was coming out soon. We weren't a huge party either, only 4 of us. Overall, great food but lacks customer service.",

The Rio location is also great because the wait times are usually a lot shorter than the one at the Linq. Down side is that the Rio is off the strip (free parking though!). Here's what we ordered:  S'mores Mocha - I typically get their Hot Chocolate which is delicious but wanted a little bit more caffeine this time. The Mocha is topped off with marshmallows and graham crackers. I recommend eating the graham crackers ASAP before they get soggy. Definitely executed well. The cup was quite large like all their portions so I couldn't finish all of it.   Safe Fried Chicken and Waffles - This dish needs some team work to make a dent in it. Four BACON-STUFFED Belgian waffles topped with two large fried pieces of chicken. I had to ask for a side of butter to add to the waffles which I recommend. Can't have waffles without butter! The chicken was fried with a great crisp and the pieces were large to make you very full. I usually get their Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which is also superb!  Tractor Driver Combo with a Blueberry Flapjack - This flapjack/pancake is so massive that it barely fits the plate. It is also enough for one person even without the combo! I normally get their French Toast which I highly recommend but I decided to go with something different. The flapjack was very fluffy, tasty, and satisfying   Overall, I love this place. I usually go every time I go to Vegas if I'm not going to a buffet. Make sure you bring your appetites!",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for a long weekend with my family. Went here twice for breakfast. One dish was AMAZING. The rest were good. Partner and I split the fried chicken benedict. We were told the portions were huge, so we tried to listen. That being said, there were six of us at the table, and we ordered three things and it was still more than enough. Benedict was the best thing we had at either meal. Bacon, eggs, and fried chicken on top of potatoes and biscuits, with spinach and tomatoes and grilled mozzarella, with a chipotle cream sauce. Parents got the chicken and waffles, which was good, but sort of normal. My uncle got something with  meatloaf, which he polished off without a complaint. We went this morning before our flight back and again, we shared a plate. Didn't leave quite as stuffed (chicken benedict was on Man VS Food), but still satisfied. We got the corn beef hash, and I was impressed, especially since I am usually not a fan. Biscuits are giant and delish, scrambled eggs were perfect. My mom got a blueberry pecan pancake, which is about the size of 4-5 normal pancakes. Partner got a cinnamon roll latte both mornings. Their hot green tea is good too.   Service was also good, especially first day. Steve was funny and attentive, even though he was busy. Our meal was brought out by different people, and our waters were refilled by assistants, but that's usually how busy restaurants work. This morning, they were again a little busy but our server and her assistant were still quick and prompt and nice. Waited 5 minutes this morning to be sat, and about 10 the first morning. We will be coming back, if only for the benedict. Might try one of their lemonades too.",

    "text": "My husband and I eat at this HH a Go-Go every time we come to Las Vegas. Their service is never a 5, but this time was just absurd. Immediately we noticed that half of the dining area was closed, for no good reason apparently. People were waiting in line to be seated, while there were clearly tables available on both sides. Okay, whatever. We got seated. It took a good 8 minutes before a busser came and took our drink order which was 2 coffees and 2 glasses of water. We got our coffee within minutes, but no water in sight. When our actual server, Marcy, finally came to take our order we asked for our waters again as well as ordering the original HH Farmhouse Benedict for myself and the Chicken and Waffles for my husband. A few minutes later the same busser returned with a water for me. Just for me though, no water for my husband. Marcy was nearly impossible to track down and when we finally got her attention and asked AGAIN for his water she seemed irritated and said okay water and walked away. My husband's chicken and Waffles arrived at the table BEFORE his water did. Finally we both had our food and were excited to be eating. This is the only reason this review has a second star. The taste was what was expected. However for the portions given, I would have expected more than one egg on my Benedict. Before even 5 minutes passes by, Marcy slams our check on our table and says \"whenever you're ready\". No \"no hurry\", or \"any dessert before I give you your tab?\" none of that. Just a rude deliverance of our bill. I felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant when all I wanted to do was sit down and enjoy a meal. The table next to us clearly had issues with Marcy as well. My husband and I observed a girl at the table ask Marcy a question when she was right next to her, and Marcy ignored her question and walked away. This experience made me want to never return to HH A Go-Go. Or at least not to this location. And honestly, Marcy needs to work on her Service skills because she is the absolute worst.",

He wandered around the floor talking to his other parties and came back to us after waiting 10 mins. This was after asking his assistance to get his attention.  He took our order without a word and we did not see him until we complained to the manager about our experience. The manager was great and listened to us, making no excuses for the shaved head waiter from New York who should be working elsewhere.  The food Fantastic! The service.......go somewhere else where they treat locals like family.",

Generous portions for most plates, if you're not too hungry and wanna share. Otherwise, wear elastic pants or unbutton that top button. Lots of guests have eaten here, like Penn and Teller, with their signed and framed  photographs decorating the entrance's walls.",

My mother in law had the apple cinnamon waffle and the slices of apple were impressive but there was no cinnamon taste. The food was way over priced but that's what you get when you eat in touristy Vegas, The waitress seemed overwhelmed. She spilled juice on my mother in law and then apologized and turned away, she wasn't on point and we ended up getting more help from the busboy.......",

So I have to go every time I'm in Vegas. When I found out that Rio opened one up I freaked! I was so excited because we are always getting good room rates for Rio but it's off the strip so to have a Hash House there was amazing.. but it is not the same.. they lack that extra touch.. It was good but not Hash House good. The place looked like the old cafe but with some HH decor and the staff.. (I'm so sorry staff) the staff were still the same old tired people from the cafe but with a new wardrobe with the same bitter attitude. Definitely going to make the trip onto the strip next time.",

    "text": "We came here based on rave reviews from the Food Network and many celebrities that have been here. Well, they must have been given special treatment none of which we were availed to upon our trip for brunch. We were starving so anything probably would have tasted good. There was a bit of a line on Sunday, March 6 around 11am, but it moved pretty quickly. We were seated and our server Steven came over right away. He took our drink orders and told us a bit about the menu (only because I asked) and then ran off. This was the most that we saw of him for the rest of our time there. My friend got the signature dish chicken and waffles. The chicken was marginal. We have had better. The \"bacon\" waffles were a joke. Of the 4 waffles only 1 had a piece of bacon running through the middle of it. They were so tough! We were given a tiny container of syrup for four giant waffles and since we didn't see Steven again, we couldn't ask for more! I ordered the basic breakfast which consisted of two eggs, bacon, a biscuit, fruit, and seasoned potatoes. There was nothing special about any of it and I was especially shocked at the size of the pieces of bacon. There were only two pieces of bacon and not two full pieces, two half pieces, so really one piece of bacon. Really?! The biscuit was hard as a rock, in fact it could have been. There were no condiments on my plate for it either. Steven NEVER checked back with us to see how our food was, so I had to flag him down to get something to put on it. (And in the end decided I didn't want to risk breaking a tooth on it anyway) The one and only refill I got on my coffee came from the busser Roger (from Thailand according to his name tag) who was working his butt off! I even had my empty coffee cup sitting on the edge of the table for 10-15 minutes and Steven walked by 3 times (at the end of our meal) and brought the check over and never refilled it!! Wow, really?! The coffee was terrible anyway so we just grabbed our check and left. Thank you to Roger though for being the one bright spot at Hash House. Don't go to this place. It is way overrated! They obviously feel like they can just pump out huge plates of food and people will be wowed and overlook everything else. Sad.",

It took a host 10 minutes to walk us to a table when the joint was nearly empty; the hostess was no where to be seen as we waited behind another guest. When we were eventually taken to a table, no employee appeared at our table for 10+ minutes...until I flagged down a poor busboy to take our drink order. After our drinks arrived, I asked if I could order since I was in town for the IBM conference and I was in a hurry to get to a session but was told he would call our server over. Another 10 minutes go by, and the same busboy took pity on us and told us he'd write down our order for our server who still at this point had not made an appearance. When our food hit the table which was 50 minutes in after we had arrived, I was appalled by the little care they took into assembling our plates. The burger had its patty flopped on, and half of it missed the bun! Hoping it would at least be hot, the patty was disappointingly cold. The only enjoyable part of our meal was the super greasy but flavorful sage fried chicken. However no one in our party seemed to care for the bacon waffle tower. Besides the wow factor of the bacon being cooked into the waffle, it did nothing to enhance the flavor nor contribute to an extraordinary texture. Yes, it's sweet from the syrup and yes, it's a little salty from the bacon. But is it special? No.  All in all, it took us 15 minutes to finish our meal when we had come in knowing exactly what we wanted so that we could be in and out. We did a huge amount of waiting and spent a small amount of time eating. Curiously enough because I didn't notice another employee walking around besides the busboy, I scanned around and found a group of them standing in the kitchen and chit-chatting like nobody's business. We did eventually meet our server though as he dropped off the check and told us to pay at the front.  As for the atmosphere, there wasn't one. No happy faces as the couple of tables next to us were waiting for service.",

Also ordered an oatmeal with a side of fruit for the little one and the bowl was bigger than his head! But for the price I'd say it's reasonable.

Family members had continuously been raving about their Chicken & Waffles, so I finally decided to give it a try back in September 2015 with my mom. We were in awe of the large servings and great tasting food. Sure, it may be a bit on the pricey side, however it's worth every penny. I've been back to Vegas twice since my first visit, and have been to this location on each returning visit, always trying something different on the menu. Not once have I been disappointed. The overall experience from the great service to the delicious food makes this place one of my favorites in Vegas.   I tried visiting the location at The Linq on a Saturday around 11:00 am and there was over an hour wait, which prompted me to head on over to the Rio, which had no wait at all even though the restaurant was full. Definitely a must try place.",

A classic blend of gluttonous amounts of average food and immense portions, with a single platter enough to feed a European family of 4, Hash House goes hand in hand with what Las Vegas is all about - ridiculous wastefulness.  Observing diners at The Rio location is like being on a farm, with patrons stuffing themselves from their troffs of jumbo pancakes, biscuit platters and other artery clogging dishes.",

( Share if you can, or plan on a 'to go' box if you have somewhere to keep the leftovers!) 4 good sized waffles, bacon strips layered about, and two ample boneless fried chicken breasts on top...YUM! My husband had the steel cut oatmeal with fruit so he could help me with my endeavor, but his turned out to be plentiful, also! The oatmeal had banana, apple, blueberries, and finely chopped mango on top.  The restaurant itself was spacious with a comfortable theme. There are numerous autographed menus on display of current celebrities, sports greats, & political figures...interesting to look at while you wait to get seated. Our only drawback was we felt a bit like a cattle-call as far as service. It was a bit impersonal, & my husband's oatmeal came out significantly earlier than my breakfast. He finally started eating before it got cold, with me just looking around wondering if they had forgotten mine.",

    "text": "The service here is probably the worst of any restaurant I've been to, and it makes me miss the days when Hash House was at M. I've had friendlier service at Arby's (for real).  The food is so-so and comes in huge portions. I always order the sage fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes, two eggs and a biscuit -- today, the eggs were runny, so much so that there was a yellow liquid pooling underneath that made the eggs look like they were sitting in soup. The fried chicken was really dry and lukewarm on top of that, and the mashed potatoes had zero flavor.   Sometimes restaurants have off days with the food,  but there's never any excuse for poor service. Our waiter (I think his name was Brian) was so busy legitimately giving my family a hard time for ordering basic breakfasts -- he says, why order a basic when you're at a restaurant with so many creative options -- that he screwed up my uncle's order and forgot to add the extra egg.   On top of that, all but one dish was brought out at the same time, so we were half finished by the time my aunt got her breakfast. I got up to find our waiter, but he blew right past me so I asked the hostess if she could check on what was going on. A few minutes later, we flagged him down and instead of apologizing, we get a lecture about how all the food is brought out fresh as it's finished -- that's cool, but it should have been better timed and he could have at least given us a heads up we'd be waiting an extra 15 mins after everyone else got served. To boot, we had to snag a hostess to pour coffee for the table after we only got served one cup in the 45 minutes we'd been sitting there.   For people who thought this spot could replace the one at the M, it doesn't . Try your luck elsewhere.   Quick tip: they don't have the 55+ menu at this location.",

There was a 45 minute wait for a table at the HH in the Quad so we took a cab to the Rio where there was zero wait (been open less than a week).  Had a scramble this time, and while it was good, the Chicken Eggs Benedict is definitely still the favorite.  They did mess up one our meals, as they forgot to put the bacon in the Waffles (chicken and waffles), however, no one noticed until our server came over and pointed it put and asked if she wanted it remade or a side of bacon, which was cool.  The COO Jim was walking around (recognized from Man vs. Food) and talked to us for a bit.  We told him how we never go to vegas without hitting HH.  Nice to see the bigwigs leading from the front and making sure the new location is consistent with the brand's standards!",

We ordered the chicken and waffles because we saw a photo of the guy from Man vs Food saying it was the best chicken and waffles. I would have to agree that the chicken has a lot of flavor but I would not say it was the best. The chicken was moist and I could taste the sage. The waffle was fluffy and has bits of bacon in the middle of the waffle which caught me by surprise.  How they presented the dish was amazing! It did not look like they just slapped it on haha. The average price for a dish is about $12-$15 which is a pretty good deal since the portions are huge.",

    "text": "When you're spending $20 for a breakfast, you have rather high expectations. Mine weren't met. Yes, this is at a resort hotel, but $20 bucks for bacon and eggs and some fruit is rather steep, so it must be because the service and food are first rate.... They're not.    The service was good but normal, and somewhat rushed for a half-filled restaurant. It was typical breakfast service, by a traditional breakfast hash-slinger.  The food was adequate, but not spectacular. Eggs are eggs everywhere, so nothing special. The bacon was spartan but really good. The crispy potatoes were simply divine. I also ordered an additional serving of fruit, and was expecting more than the small bowl of exactly 5 pieces of fresh fruit I got for $4. For jam, they serve this chutney-like mango or apricot concoction. Missed the actual fruit name. It was flavorless and bad, and if you're looking for another flavor of jarred jam, you have to ask for it, and wait for it's arrival. Toast now cold. I ordered my toast's butter on the side, and it was practically frozen, and NEVER melted on the bread.   My biggest disappointed came when I ordered a side of a pancake, and was told I couldn't. I had to choose from the full breakfast of pancakes. The pancakes here are enormous, and only wanted an ala carte side pancake...BUT NO!! My request was not going to be accommodated, in a restaurant fully capable of doing so. What BS. If a customer wants something....make it for them...  I ALREADY ORDERED A FULL BREAKFAST, AND JUST WANTED ONE PANCAKE ON THE SIDE. It's truly dumb of a restaurant not to make this option available as an add-on with a full breakfast, thus losing a customer forever. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.  Hash House a Go Go is definitely a No No for me next time in Vegas. The food and service are good, but that's all. It's just breakfast food, and not spectacular, nor all that inventive either. Can't see the price justification. Don't waste your time, unless you enjoy being ripped off..",

Our friends ordered Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, French Toast with Banana Plantains, Eggs and Bacon and I can't remember what my other friend ordered. But we had to order their Large Pancake since they didn't come in smaller size and the 3 year old wanted pancakes!!! They didn't have kids menu...I guess being in the casino they don't expect kids to come and enjoy meals that's not overwhelming. Our order was ok - the chicken was flavorful but our waffles needed to be cooked more. You could taste the batter - it wasn't crunchy on the edge and just too soft. My girlfriends fried chicken Eggs Benedict was flavorful as well but way too large. My French toast was really good! And the pancake was just ridiculous! I'm glad I shared my breakfast. I hate wasting food. I wished their prices were lower and the portions weren't ridiculous! I do love how they present their food - so artistic. The restaurant itself is really cool and our waitress, Liz, was nice.",

Well designed and immense in size with clever interior flourishes complimenting the concept of \"Twisted Farm Food\" it was mere moments after the puck dropped on the third period that I arrived to the hostess stand and after a brief greeting I was handed off to a lovely lady named Peggy who would keep watchful eye over me throughout the overtime-extended visit - the nearly eighty minute stay ample time to enjoy approximately a whole pot of hot coffee and all that arrived on Hash House's enormous signature plates.  Deciding to go one sweet and one savory with a request to deliver the former followed by the latter it was with the special pancake that I arrived and truly the size of the hubcap it was exactly what I expected, fluffy and laced with buttermilk but exceedingly sweet; the equivalent of eating birthday cake for breakfast and exactly the sort of thing I'm willing to go out early for, though probably a dish best shared...particularly given what followed in a Benedict balancing a surfboard of crisp, lean pork with top quality vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes beneath lightly sweetened and tangy barbeque cream.  Perhaps not 'refined' and undoubtedly 'over the top,' yet a place with something for everyone given their dedication to ethical farming and product sourcing Hash House a Go-Go remains one of the rare mini-chains I'm happy to support and with newer locations even offering 'lite' options of simple eggs, toast, proteins, and salads its only a matter of time before I visit the downtown and Sahara locations...the best biscuits in the city just one more highlight on an already long list.",

I got swiss instead of my requested cheddar. The crispy potatoes were over cooked.    He requested the BBBLT. The bread was over toasted and came with more lettuce than bacon. It should have been called the BBLLLLLT.   Needless to say, we won't be returning to this location. Not worth the time or money.",

Which was essentially like a bananas foster sort of deal with caramelized bananas and caramel in top, the pecans however we not candied or caramelized like the menu said they'd be.  They were just some regular old pecans sprinkled on top.  The meal was tasty, I was seated by the bar so I was able to eat and watch the baseball games on the TV's above the bar.

    "text": "What an excellent breakfast we had at this place. It is a very large place, so we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. We got seated in a large booth and had plenty of room to stretch out and eat. Out came the largest pancake I had ever seen in my life. I usually finish everything and clean my plate at most breakfast places, but not this time. I was literally only able to eat about half of the pancake before I was absolutely stuffed. The eggs were very moist and juicy, and the bacon was perfectly crispy. This was a perfect 10 out of 10 breakfast.  Our server was extremely friendly, and gave us tips on the menu that would save money b/c of their extremely large portions. When it was all said and done, all 3 of us could have only ordered 1 pancake and we all would have been full off of it. We ended up ordering 2 pancakes for the 3 of us, and there was almost a full pancake worth of leftovers remaining after we were done. So beware of the size of the pancakes before everyone is your party decides to order one b/c multiple pancakes are not needed. I would say 1 pancake will easily feed 3 people.   This location is a little ways away from the strip, but it is worth the drive to have an awesome breakfast without a huge crowd or a wait time.",

I ordered the tracker breakfast with came with bacon, eggs and  I chose the french toast option. My friend order the same and chose the pancake option.... the pancake and french toast was colossal, but yummy! I bet my friend that she could not finish is, she tried but fail. After having 2 mimosas I could barely finish my eggs, after 2 bits of french toast, I was done.   Check out was fun, the ladies were so funny at the front and very polite. Our waiter was funny and very polite, he was helping me make the important decisions like what flavor mimosa to choose. This is definitely a great spot to check out when visiting Vegas!",

Coffee is a bottomless cup, which she refilled frequently.   While you wait to be served, plates pass by with massive portions and items on them. I was amazed by a waffle the size of a gamer's flatscreen monitor. When our food arrived, portions were similarly stunning.   Unfortunately, the food is just kind of so-so. I ordered an egg dish, and while the egg was tasty, the large biscuit had more of a scone consistency and was bland, while the potatoes were not crispy or flavorful at all (and seemed kind of hard, too). How can a place that calls itself Hash House not have mastered potatoes? I don't know, but they did.    Did I mention the 70's music? I liked it, but there was an eight-track flashback quality to it for sure.  It was okay, but no more, and nothing I'd seek out specifically.",

Don't get me wrong though, they are still good, but their tastes just don't match their presentations. The flavours are just not there. Another one of my big complaints is the cleanliness of their utensils. We arrive at the table as a party of six and I had to send back four of the six sets due to some food (like egg yoke) stains and finger prints found on the utensils. And the same things were found again in the new sets they replaced. This totally thrown me off - cleanliness is a big thing for me when I visit restaurants and hotels. And this definitely impacted my entire impression of this place. Nonetheless the waiter is friendly and patient enough to respond to all of my concerns.",

Shameful to treat corned beef this way but I guess when it's bland you have to cover it in cheese to make it passable. My eggs, ordered over-medium, were undercooked with the whites still very runny. The biscuit, which comes on almost every plate, was hard enough to use as a weapon. My biscuit wasn't just a fluke either as another person's at our table was the same way. Not sure why you would put sub-par biscuits on almost every plate. Toasted white bread would've been better than that thing. The ham and cheddar scramble was the same thing you can get at 10,000 diners across the country....nothing special. And at 14$ it should be. A lot of people reviewing this place say the portions are \"huge\". That was not my experience. They have big pancakes but when it comes to the eggs and meats (the things that actually cost money) the portions are normal. The best part of breakfast were the breakfast potatoes.....and that's sad.",

    "text": "Definitely a great spot for breakfast. We ate here twice while staying at Rio. The portions are more than generous and cooked to perfection both times. You might want to share, because i could barely finish half.   We ordered a basic breakfast to-go the first time, and the pumpkin flapjack combo and corn beef hash the second time we dined in. Yummy! The pumpkin flapjack is not only humorously sized, but it was moist and flavorful, too. I really like their sausages. The corn beef was surprisingly really good as well.   Service was great. Our waiter was quick, friendly, and spoke with the right amount of energy for a Vegas morning. Plenty of seating, wasnt too busy either times.   Good place to go for a big, traditional breakfast.",

It was pretty BIG, even sharing the plate made us full. The dish itself was good, but not the best chicken and waffles I've had (I'm partial to one place in Portland, and Roscoe's in LA is always a classic to me).  The restaurant itself is pretty standard looking, nothing special. Service was nice, and it could get busy around lunch time (about a 20-30 min wait). I'm curious to see how the San Diego location looks like, considering that's where the original Hash House is based. Other than that, it's just a regular country style breakfast spot in Vegas... with BIG PORTIONS!",

While all of the other restaurants in the Rio seemed to have closed down, this one is heading in that direction with it closing at 3PM. Who says we can't have breakfast food for dinner?! There are many, many Hash House locations that opened up in the Valley in the last several years and this is probably the worst location to come to. The restaurant is either extremely dead with tourists that had the misfortune to stay in the Rio, or packed post convention center events.  The food is good, overpriced, but the portion size makes up for it. I wish they had a half size portion option. If you order a meal here, you'll be getting 2 because there's no way you'll be able to finish it in a single setting.  Andy chicken and waffles, Andy's benedict are the most popular and signature plates here. Both are good, I prefer the benedict. Ask for it without tomatoes!",

There is sometimes a short wait, but they tend to get through the line fast and they also added some quick to go type options during the series. Once seated the service tends to be very good- and the food comes out extremely fast.  I did want to play keno and the one day my food actually came out before the keno lady came around, and the other day was about 20 mins in or we would've played more games.  The food is a bit expensive for breakfast, but the portions are literally huge.   I got a different meal everyday from an omelet with chicken, meatloaf has, and a salad with fried chicken.  The meatloaf hash I liked but didn't love- the meat had a fluffy type texture- not your traditional meatloaf, and had just ok flavor.  I wish there were more smaller, healthier options available as leftover eggs and biscuits just aren't that appealing.  Overall, I enjoy HHAGG and its a good option at rio for breakfast, come hungry, and leave full.",

    "text": "It baffles me that this place has so many positive reviews. Let me begin by saying that I am not opposed to creative variants on classics nor do I object to trying new concoctions. I had high hopes for this place going in. However, if you're going to concoct something so radically different from a traditional dish that it's completely unrelated, consider a rename or at least have a version close to the classic on the menu.  If you're going to claim to have \"benedicts\" on your menu, at a minimum, you ought to offer something that involves english muffins, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. Minimum. No such luck here...  I will mention the good (as it's brief and I don't want to be unfair in my review): The staff was prompt and courteous. The service was good but not fantastic.  The food, however, was as bad as it was oversized.  I went in jonesing for Eggs Benedict. Yelp suggested this place and I made the mistake of not reviewing the menu in detail before going there.  There was a substantial line to get a table, which was not helped by the fact that elite hotel club members (7 star and diamond) could bypass the line and get seated right away. It's one thing to offer priority seating on an airplane where everyone gets to the destination at the same time and priority only really affects where you wait for the departure and whether or not you get overhead bin space. It's an entirely different matter to let elites cut the line on a 15-30 minute wait for a table.  Further exacerbating this was the fact that there's no take your name and have a seat we'll call you, you stand in line for the entire wait.  The menu in this place is fairly limited and there's not really anything on there that corresponds to what you would expect from the terms they use. The \"Benedicts\" are no exception. Reading the menu, the closest I could come (description wise) was the pounded pork loin benedict, which I ordered.  Here's what arrived when the food came:  A serving-platter sized plate covered in skin-in course-mashed potatoes. Into the smear of potato lumps (roughly plate sized and about 3/4\" thick) two halves of a very large biscuit were inserted crust down. On top of this, were a slice of tomato on each biscuit and some spinach. Atop that was a legal-paper size breaded deep fried pork cutlet (not what I expected from the words \"pounded pork loin\"). (I'd skipped the fried-chicken benedict because I was hoping to avoid the breaded and deep fried aspect as I don't particularly care for deep fried breading). On top of this monstrosity of pork abuse was a small pile of very firm (almost rubbery) scrambled eggs and the whole thing was topped with a modest amount of yellowish-brown mushroom gravy.  That's right... Not one single ingredient in common with a proper eggs benedict in the entire concoction.  I'm a pretty big eater and I was hungry, but I only managed to choke down about a third of this disappointment. The portion could easily serve 2 very large very hungry people or a family of 4 in many circumstances.  Since I was dining alone, the large portion size didn't really do anything positive for me as it just increased the amount of waste. (In case you're thinking I am a small-portion person, I'm really not. This is the first time I can ever remember complaining that a restaurant delivered too much food... EVER.)  The meal was finally capped off with the bill. I knew from the menu that the benedict was overpriced (though perhaps not if I consider it as a meal for 2+) at almost $20, but the real sticker shock came from $3.99 for a single glass of Iced Tea which was never refilled (or even offered).  It's not that $4 is going to break the bank so much as the principle of paying that much for a glass of tea when the going rate even in michelin rated places seems to be $2 to $2.50.",

I got the pumpkin pancake instead of the regular flavor and it was so delicious! It was huge, almost bigger than the plate! I was only able to eat half, but the potatoes and eggs were great as well. The potatoes were so flavorful, which was surprising because normally I'm disappointed with breakfast potatoes. The only think missing for me was salsa, I like to eat my eggs with salsa but they don't have salsa here, so I settled for tobacco sauce. But other than that, great breakfast and great service!",

    "text": "We came here for a Sunday brunch to celebrate my grandson's 15th birthday. He had never been to Hash House A Go Go. He felt that there was no dish they could serve him that he couldn't finish. He was that confident in a 15 year old boy's appetite. Needless to say, the portion size that he received was so large, despite his normally huge appetite, he was only able to knock off about 90%. I shared the mushroom hash with my wife. Together we were able to finish about 90% of the dish. The food was good but not great. But the volume was huge. Lots of potatoes covered with mushroom artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato, and sauteed spinach. It came with two scrambled eggs and a huge biscuit. No one left hungry. Service was slow and for the most part we were ignored in terms of refilling water and coffee. But it was not terrible and our server certainly tried. You don't go to Hash House A Go Go for gourmet food. You go for the huge portions and the Casual atmosphere. And they do both of those very well.",

After talking to the waitress and the manager they finally admitted it comes from a box that's fresh squeezed from the factory. They are trained by the main managing company to insist that its Fresh Squeezed?????? I guess they dont understand the word FRESH. If its squeezed somewhere else then put in a box and served much later , its NOT FRESH. The stuff at the grocery taste better.  BTW the food is marginal at best. The portions are big. Prices are high. Will you really trust your food to a restaurant that lies lies lies. What else are they lying about??",

A simple request to substitute bacon with chicken sausage was denied according to the waiter it was the chefs choice. However, when we asked to speak with the manager he said made the decision to deny. Not everyone eats. And a simple dietary request should have been accommodated. The excuses that the assistant manager on duty day just didn't make sense and quite frankly has ruined my Pinyan of hash House a go go. My advice is that you skip the one at the Rio and go to one of the other restaurants in Las Vegas.",

I originally had told the waiter that I wanted the same thing but he was like well if you're new here an are ordering the same you're not going to get to try the other stuff. He suggested I get the French toast with banana. Okay cool. I agreed. I thought hash house meant they had some bomb ass hash browns, but I got diced potatoes. Maybe that's real hash? I usually prefer the \"different\" type of hash vs diced potatoes if you know what I mean lol The French toast was amazing, but I felt that they just fileted a banana in half, dipped it in a sauce and put it on the plate. I didn't care for the banana at all, especially since I don't eat bananas. I had a piece of like my boyfriends chicken and it was pretty good, but didn't appreciate the leaves in the batter. I'm picky but I like herbs, but not full or huge chunks in my chicken skin. I'd go back to try the other things on the menu though, hoping the next experience is better.",

I tried some of the waffles which were mediocre. The chicken barely had any meat on it. The breading was so thick I figured there had to be some chicken in there somewhere. Not so much. The \"chicken\" did not even have a good flavor. It was a waste of $ 50.00 for sure. I left almost the entire plate.",

I can't imagine how much the Workers Compensation Insurance is for all of the cases of carpal tunnel syndrome that this restaurant are going to garner. I ordered the Mushroom House and was really disappointed with what arrived but look like frozen vegetables that it is sitting out for some time where overcooked and had been under the heat lamp for a long time also there were cold spots in the food the wait staff which was attentive and professional handled me sending the item back without any complaint and when they brought back a fresh one it was better. the potatoes were quite pedestrian and I could have found similar quality and any Frozen Foods aisle of a local supermarket. the vegetables especially with spinach was fresh but the artichoke hearts seemed like they were canned. Eggs and biscuit were just ok.   so for a $16 entree that was just okay I don't think this was a very good value for the money.",

You could definitely order one breakfast item and split it between two people. We ordered the Banana Cream French Toast and the Pumpkin Pancake. The french toast was good but didn't really seem like anything special. The Pumpkin pancake on the other hand was horrible, I am a huge pumpkin fan but the pancake i had tasted sour and left a bitter taste in my mouth. I ended up sending it back and ordered cereal instead. The other downside to this place was a lack of staff. The waiters were all great but the restaurant could have used a few more people on staff.",

House a Go go extreme happiness while staying at rio to discover they have one there now Fast forward to breakfast next day and all I can say is what happened to a great breakfast place? But I think I can come up with the answer, let's take a semi upscale trendy place and stick it where a coffee shop was but keep all the same employees in place and see what we get.   What you get is horrible inattentive service by people that clearly don't want to be there, no smiles no happiness food served cold and a floor manager that you could not get hold off because he was way to busy trying to look busy walking around in circles while keeping his head high enough to ignore the stares of confused diners who were under the impression they were getting what they paid for. Sorry hash house love your food but this location may be a huge mistake, it may even keep me from staying at the Rio because I love breakfast but not at this place we out",

My omelet was nothing special. I got sick of it halfway through. Boyfriend got bacon instead of sausage but he didn't complain. We got the potatoes (don't remember what it's called) and both of ours were burnt- smelled and tasted. Biscuits were thick and dry, I didn't even bother eating mine.

Way too much food to eat but you can try. I'd come here again and order the same thing. Probably one of the best French toast experiences I've had.",

I'm not sure what it is but the quality in San Diego seems better than in Vegas. Possibly why the San Diego location is so hard to get into.

    "text": "I had searched for 'best fried chicken' in Vegas and, lo and behold, Hash House A Go Go popped up as a top rated place for their sage chicken. Amazingly enough, it happened to be in my hotel so I planned on stopping in for breakfast one morning prior to a conference.   I sat at the already crowded bar and enjoyed the company. I was warned before I ordered that there was no way to finish all of the food that they gave you.  That proved correct.   I ordered the chicken and waffles since I'd heard their sage chicken was delicious. When the food came out, there were two huge breaded airline chicken breasts on top of four waffles which barely fit on the oversized plate. There were also fried leeks plus a spring of sage for presentation purposes but I ate one bite of the leeks and moved them to the side.   As for the chicken, it was okay at best. I'll have to say, it was juicy, but the breading and spices were missing something. Even the syrup didn't help enough. Fortunately, the waffles turned out to be delicious. They were made with a piece of smoked bacon cooked right in and hanging out of the corners of the waffles. The bacon was very tasty and I wish I had an order of that separate.   All that led to a 3-star rating.  If giant portions were the main criterion then it would be a 5-star kind of place. Unfortunately, I felt like the chicken was very average and not worth a repeat visit during my stay.",

We placed an order for the chicken and waffles and ordered a round of shots and a bloody Mary to share (we're in Vegas and it's a Friday morning and day 1 of EDC).   It was a little over 30 minutes (three round of shots, 2nd glass of mimosas and one beer... Shots were hooked up/heavily poured) before our order came and by then the entire restaurant was packed.  We took our to-go order and left. When we got back to our hotel room, it hit us that the portion size was HUGE! The waffle is the size of medium pizza (it came in a pizza box) and the chicken was perfectly fried, crispy and packed with flavor. It was like a boujee chicken and waffle. Oh and the waffle had bacon in it! SO GOOD!   Would definitely recommend this spot if you don't mind waiting.",

The waiter indicated that the food was made to order, followed by something else we could not understand. That being said when the food came out, it looked amazing. There is flavor in the bites but the temperature was warm not hot. It tasted like it had been sitting and had a room temperature feel to it. Was not something you would expect if someone says made to order and fresh. I don't like room temperature food when it comes to eating out. The waiter took quite some time to bring the check after serving the food.  If we were to come back and try this place out it probably wouldn't be at this location.",

We just went downstairs and played some roulette until our time was up.  I ordered the Nashville Hot chicken and waffles. This is a huge serving. Definitely share it with someone at your table if possible. The flavor was great and the breading on the chicken was crispy and delicious. The Hot definitely had some heat to it. I was glad the maple syrup offset the heat a bit. There's also bacon cooked into the waffles. At first this was really good but after a while it just feels like a lot. Who knew I'd complain about the amount of bacon I'd be getting.   Our waiter was very nice. Everyone seemed to be very attentive. I ordered the Bloody Mary and it was good.",

    "text": "We went to Hash House A Go Go on a recommendation, and while the food was generally better than your average breakfast place, there were several reasons why we won't be going back.  #1 - Portion sizes are ridiculous; a bus boy (busser?) acknowledged that they waste SO MUCH food. I like a big portion as much as the next person, but this is over the top, and it's often stuff that you wouldn't want to take home (e.g. a syrup-soaked half pancake).  #2 - The food looks amazing; everything is rich and boldly flavored. That sounds like a good thing, but it's like eating candy; the first few bites are great, but the more you eat, the more you start to feel a little gross.  #3 - Prices were pretty darn high - not sure whether that was True in all locations or just in locations within a casino.  The next day, we went to a Black Bear on the way home, and it was just a much better experience (and we felt better afterward).  If you're curious, give Hash House A Go Go a try - but take my advice and split something between two people. You won't leave hungry.",

My friend really enjoyed his SAGE FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES. It was $107 without tip for three adults and a kid with coffee and OJ... We went at 8:30 on a Saturday and there was no wait. They have cream packets but not fresh cream.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas last week for a conference at the Rio and ate here on three occasions.  The first time my wife and I had a late breakfast, with both of us ordering the basic breakfast.  The service was prompt and very attentive, the food was great, and for Vegas prices we felt the meal and service was priced at a good value.  The second time I ate there for lunch with a small group of conference goers (i.e., five of us in total).  The service wasn't as prompt, and not as attentive - although the server was quite friendly and pleasant when he was there (admittedly it was much busier than my first visit).  I ordered the sage waffles and chicken, having seen others order it during our first visit - my colleagues order a variety of things from sandwiches to salads to breakfast.  The sage chicken and waffles were nothing special.  The one thing that I did note with just about everyone's meal was more food than what we could eat.  My third visit was also for lunch with a single colleague.  It wasn't as slow as my first visit, but it was pretty slow.  I ordered the basic breakfast again, which I quite enjoyed and was a good amount of food.  While the service on my second visit was questionable, the service on this visit was just terrible.  Basically, other than taking our order, bringing our food, and giving us the check, we were completely ignored.  We were there for 75 minutes and not once did they ask or offer to re-fill my cup of coffee.  If this had been my experience the first time, I would not have returned - and unless I find myself at another conference at the Rio, I seriously doubt that I would waste my time on this place again.",

There were a few people in our group who waited about 45 minutes for their food. Their excuse was that they ran out of chicken. -_- Instead of warning us from the get go, they brought us the wrong order three times (which all included chicken) and when we tried finding our waitress she was no where to be found until all the right orders were with her. We also noticed that a table next to us (who was seated after us) had eaten and paid their check before our friends received their food. I don't know if it was an off day for them, but I can't say I'd come back after that wait. It just seemed like everyone was unorganized and it caused me to leave Vegas way later than I wanted to.",

As a result my meal came with a long black hair half hanging on my plate of food. The other people in my party were not impressed with their dishes. The pancakes are oddly thick and extremely large but no flavor. The waffle was dry. The skillet smelled wonderful but the taste was not great. The biscuit that came with the skillet was very thick and doughy. The highlight of the breakfast was the jam/compote that came with the biscuit. It was blueberry and just the right amount of sweet. Two stars, one star for the blueberry alone. For the price of this meal and the popularity, not worth it. I would not go again.",

Finally we got to try it on a day off!   The portion sizes are huge, I guess for the price of the meals they should be. I ordered the Andy's special which was melted cheese with scrambled egg, fried chicken, bacon spinach, tomato, biscuit on griddled potato mash thing and chipotle cream on the side. Oh and a wedge of watermelon and a strawberry. When It arrived at the table I thought they had brought the wrong thing over it was that huge. I attempted to dismantle it so I could start eating it but it was piled up so high the fried chicken fell off the top and knocked my full large glass of orange juice over onto my meal. I think the orange juice actually helped the potato thing because that was pretty dry. I still managed to get through most of it (except the biscuit and potato..trying to watch my waistline hahaha). It was all just ok. Not overly tasty not overly anything.. Just big and edible...   The service was good as well. The lady replaced my OJ.   Everyone else's meals were pretty much the same.. Nothing wrong with it just nothing fabulous.. Yet to find a decent breakfast place in Vegas!!!  Would I come back here? Only if I was desperate..",

We ordered their most popular dish, which was also starred on their menu: Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. I was never a fan of ever trying the chicken & waffle combination, but I was always curious on why it was so popular. But now I know! This dish is definitely enough to split between two people, as it comes with 4 waffles WITH BACON INSIDE and 2 fried chickens connected by a skewer. Maple syrup also accompanies this food tower. The salty bacon and sweet waffle complement each other so well that my friends and I couldn't stop smiling as we ate. Before we knew it, we were super stuffed and my friend who typically doesn't waste food, had to give up a few bites of her waffle due to bloatedness. That's when you know this restaurant has good quality and good portions.  Service was spectacular as well! Definitely take time out of your vacation to grab a bite here because you won't regret it :)",

    "text": "So Hash is like the Midwest on mega-roids.  The portions are cow-sized, my friend finished like 10% of her chicken and waffles.  My buddy ate most of his grilled mashed potato stuffed double cheeseburger that was almost the size of his head and I don't know how he was able to walk out of the place.  I wanted everything on the menu, happily ended up with the corned beef hash, also way more than I could finish.  I will probably never stay at the Rio, but I will definitely go back there for lunch at Hash, before I want to take a serious nap that is.  I will probably order two entrees for a table of six.  And the price per serving size has to be the best deal in town.  This place is ludicrous in all the best Midwest ways, down to the barrels of wheat and portraits of corn decorating the place.",

    "text": "This is a new Hash House a GoGo location. Formerly the San Paulo cafe (rio coffee shop)   We dined here in on a Friday a little past noon and we walked right in without a single person in line, it seems that it's such a new location that no one knows about it just yet. It does have a separate line for 7 star, diamond and platinum total rewards card holders for the VIPs in case of long wait times.   We had the chicken and waffles, vanilla waffles and banana brown sugar pancakes. All were delicious and met hash house a GoGo standards and the service was excellent.   For those who do not like to walk through casinos you can park in the back entering through Twain (making sure you don't turn into the employee parking). The parking to use is in the back where the penn & teller theater, pavilion and convention parking is.  Also for Total rewards card members you get a $1 off most entrees and caesars entertainment employees get 25% off total bill.",

This location is way into the casino and down the hall leading to the convention rooms, a bit inconvenient for the seniors in my group but they held up ok. The bonus was it put the restaurant away from all the cigarette smoke of the casino floor. Portions were expected huge but they still were shocked at the giant flapjack (which was pretty dried out). Other items at the table were some scrambles, corned beef and a portabella burger. It didn't seem my cousin liked the portabella because she left most of it on the plate and ate a few sweet potato fries. The biscuits were big and dense but very dried out too and we couldn't figure out what the fresh squashed berry \"jam\" was, raspberry or strawberry or both. I didn't mind my ham and spinach scramble but it was pretty boring and not very big portion (about what you'd get at any other big breakfast chain) so I guess only some things on the menu are oversized. The flapjack was taken home in hopes of somehow making it moist again for next day breakfast(perhaps a soak in butter and maple syrup??) but alas that flapjack went into the trash, as dry as the cardboard take home box it left in.  Decent service and they were obviously used to crowds there. Perhaps would try again with a smaller group and maybe different location.",

We spilt the chorizo and eggs combo, which came with two eggs, fruit, potatoes and a biscuit. And an a la cart of apple cinnamon flap jack.   We only really needed the first thing we ordered and definitely not the flap jack. The chorizo was mixed in with the potatoes and salsa, with a few jalapenos. The biscuit was almost the same size as a Cinnabon roll, with a hard shell and fluffy on the inside. It came with a side of butter and jam. Not sure what type but it was delicious!   The flap jack was bigger than the plate they served it on, thick, and came with sliced granny simth apples on the top of the pancake. My hubs only complaint about the pancake was that it didn't come with enough syrup. I personally don't like thick pancakes, so I wasn't a fan - I like more of the thin and crispy edges type.   Our service was great and overall a better experience! I can't wait to come back to get the chorizo and eggs.",

Food * The Sage Fried Chicken Breast was a tad heavy on the breading, a bit dry and not especially hot  - all suggesting it was pre-cooked. Still good - but not great like our previous visit.   * Scrambled eggs & bacon mashed potatoes were fantastic!   * Biscuit was also on the dry side.  * Butter & Jams. One of the meal's highlights! The homemade jams are scrumptious, as is the butter (would buy them if they sold them).   Price/Value.  * Our dish was around $15 which may seem pricey - but when you consider it stuffed 2 hungry adults it was really a good deal!                             ***** Will definitely be back*****",

The establishment itself is spacious and decor is very simple and neat.  The menu has a well rounded selection of food and drinks. I don't recall anything on the menu being priced under $15 but presentation and portion size was impressive.  If anyone is unsure about trying this place out, I don't think you'll be disappointed. It was definitely a nice experience for me.",

    "text": "I went to HH in the Rio just last Saturday on a whim. We were starving and saw the ad in the elevator! When we got to the restaurant, we were a little worried about the line. It was already about 10:30 or so, the line was pretty long, and we just decided to wait it out. We had seen that there were six or seven empty tables just in our line of sight, so we hoped the line would move fast. I'm glad we did.   We were seated, coffee and waters were brought to the table pretty quickly, and then we waited to have our order taken. That seemed to take a while. Then we ordered (both of us went for the Tractor combo with grilled French toast). I have to say that waiting for the food to come out seemed to take forever.   However, once the food got there, it was AMAZING. Loved the banana and pecans with the French toast. My eggs - done over medium - were perfect. The bacon was crispy - I couldn't find anything to complain about! The portions were huge, and there was no way I could finish it all. I didn't feel that the price was too high given the amount of food.  My only complaint was that our server seemed slow. We waited forever to get our order taken, to get the food, and then to get our check. What should have been an hour in and out took about double that. Not good if you're in a hurry, I guess.",

The menu was big, with a lot of options for breakfast.   As this was my first time eating at this restaurant, I asked the waitress to help me decide between the pancake and the waffle. She suggested that I order the pancake. I ordered the brown sugar banana pancake and was so confused as to why it was just one pancake. Well, when it arrived at the table, the pancake was huge! It was so good as well. I definitely recommend getting their 'pancake'.  My boyfriend ordered the two egg breakfast. He said that his potatoes were overcooked. The eggs didn't taste very good. The biscuit was hard as a rock. The only thing edible was his bacon.   If you're going to eat here, I recommend going for their popular items.",

    "text": "The four stars from my review are going to be based solely on the quality of the food and wait time. We were seated almost immediately. I heard the other locations had pretty long waits, but the Rio location didn't, so that was nice!  I ordered a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was so much food, definitely enough to feed 2 - 3 people. Instead of getting scrambled eggs, I got poached eggs instead. The mediocre poached eggs came out 30 minutes after the rest of my meal was brought to the table, and they were too cooked to even be considered poached!!!! They weren't cooked enough to be considered hard-boiled either, lol. Luckily the rest of my dish saved the meal.  The sage chicken was flattened chicken breast with a delicious breaded crust. The mashed potatoes were delightful, and the entire dish was topped in enough chipotle hollandaise sauce to soak the biscuits.  I almost had a heart attack reading the dish's description on the menu, and damn near passed out when I tried it myself. I was such a huge portion that I took home 2/3 of my meal to eat later on. I normally take pictures of my food when I'm out and about, but didn't this time because I was so eager to dig in.  Our server truly did not give a damn (if I'm being honest), but I can understand where she's coming from. This restaurant serves cocktails with breakfast, so she probably has to deal with drunk people making a mess every single shift.. LOL. I definitely wasn't one of them, but I empathize with homegirl completely.  I'd come back and maybe order takeout next time because the service I received here was definitely two stars max. The food here is good enough for me to give it another shot during my next Las Vegas trip.",

It tasted better when I added buttercream, but I think a biscuit should taste better on its own. It was so dry I still have the flavor lingering in my mouth. There was one slice of honeydew and orange. There was no point of it being there cause they didn't add much of anything. That was $15, but nonetheless a pretty average meal  I also got the pineapple mimosa, because the waiter insisted of getting that instead of the lemonade mimosa, rubbing me the wrong way. It was $8, and personally think I've tasted better $8 mimosas.   This place was ok and convenient as it was at my hotel, but if possible try other brunch places in the area that's worth the money.",

What better way to eat in the morning than to walk downstairs and munch on some delicious breakfast foods, or so i thought... The service was good! I don't want to discredit any of the servers. They did their job and they did it well. Tentative whenever they could, however they could.  Hash house is extremely big. At least 30 tables. Too big for the store to handle. My group and I waited outside for roughly 30 minutes for a table and when seated, it took around 50-65 minutes to get our food! That was atrocious! Either they need to reduce the seating quantity or hire more chefs!   The portions of the entrees were big! I had a pancake platter that was literally twice the size of my head and an inch thick! Maybe that's their reason for taking so long.  The prices were fairly reasonable, but i wouldn't recommend each person getting their own dish. The entrees were definitely big enough to share amongst others. My group of 5 shared 3 entrees and it was enough food.  Overall, the food was alright, but not worth the wait. Service was kind, but we came to eat. Probably wouldn't come to this location, i would definitely try their other locations if the opportunity rises. Thanks for reading!",

When it comes to Price you cant really say its expensive due to it being Vegas and in a Casino, if you really look at it, its decent, so price was not the problem.  The portions are a good size so you get your monies worth there. Me, wife and 5 kids got 3 dishes and one extra pancake ( we really didn't need the extra pancake), and that feed us all, we even had a little to take back to the room.  Our waiter was awesome, informative and super nice.  The airy ambiance and decor was cool also.  Here's the thing the food was ok at best, my son which is a pancake person didn't care for them at all, and when i tasted them they were dry and just non fluffy. The sage chicken was bad it was also dry and doughy. I am a self proclaimed County fried stake king and have bought frozen grocery store CFS that was better, like in the pics way too much gravy and the cfs was so thin i had to scrape off the sauce and find it...  would i go back to give it a second chance sure but that's the only reason i would go back",

It seems they follow a team set up and you have more than one person waiting tables, and they are all equally displeased that you should even be there. Our first waitress told us that we were ordering too much food, when my girl friend and I had ordered one thing each.   I understand it is customary to forewarn patrons about the big sizes. But she was adamant we shouldn't be ordering so much. I didn't find one item per person to be too much, especially because my friend ate all of her French toast. I had also gotten a tea. The menu did not indicate whether or not refills were free. When I asked for a refill from a male waiter he told me refills were not free and he would have to charge me for a full price of a drink which was almost 5$.   I decided against a refill only to find out that refills were no charge when I went to the cashier to pay. I am not sure what the staff's problem is here but I guess they just want to do as little work as possible. Luckily, there is another hash house at the linq and from previous experience, the service there is not this horrendous.",

As for the coffee, it merited several packets of sugar to be even slightly tolerable. Let me put it this way: I don't add sugar or sweetener to my Starbucks coffee. That's  how bad the coffee here is. I couldn't even finish this ghastly meal, and my stomach is still cramping as I write this. The only saving grace was the staff. Micki, in particular, is a wonderful server, and the only reason this place merits a second star. Save your money, go elsewhere for food.",

But the prices are high and the portions are decent, but the quality is not there. The food wasn't even really warm and the biscuit was extra dry (butter wouldn't even melt on it).   My main issue: there was a hair in my eggs so they had to remake my meal. Okay, not the end of the world but my daughter and I were sitting there while the rest of our party ate. Ours came practically when they were done.  I THOUGHT they would offer a discount or comp my meal BUT no. No one even offered an apology - in fact they kind of acted surprised that I requested a new dish haha.

We quickly ordered our meals as we were hoping to not have to be there for another hour. After ordering, he proceeded to take 5 other tables orders and ring them all in at the same time. We waited for our food for almost 45 minutes. I even asked him for an update on our status and never heard back. It was just BAD. I was about to leave a couple of times. I understand being a very popular and busy place. However, a business/restaurant should be fully prepared for that. It was just a mess!  In regards to my meal, it was tasty and at least hot when it arrived. I ordered the corned beef hash and really enjoyed the flavor, along with the fresh biscuit. My boyfriend loved the popular fried chicken biscuit and gravy special. The iced coffee was also really good.  Overall, I will probably pass on Hash House A Go Go the next time I'm in Vegas. It is not worth the hype.",

    "text": "Been to the one in San Diego and had to check this one out as we were driving though Vegas. Ordered the Chicken pot pie and got a banana latte. The Pot Pie came out as impressive as all other Hash House dishes come out, they always come out wow'ing you. The crust is very flaky and brittle. I do like it a little more doughy then extreme flaky but nothing to loose a star over, just preference. The filling had broccoli , corn, green beans, bell pepper, scallions ect ect. The side had mashed red potatoes that was paired very well with the pot pie filling.   The banana latte was almost like a black & tan were the coffee and banana flavoring was in separate layers. It's best to mix it to get the full flavor of the beverage.",

The table was shaking and my water smells like egg. I ordered the chicken scramble no onion they put onion on top of my potatoes & the egg wasn't cooked wdone like the way I asked only 3 small pieces of chicken. The biscuit was hard as a rock not even my dog would eat it. no recommended for sure   Also i tried to pay with debit card they asked for me ID. She swiped card 4 times i have never had issues with it. The receipt printer was out of paper she had to call manager to replace it. My friend immediately had stomach pains after eating the food.",

We ask them to plate it to go as we were tired of waiting. The manager apologized but were had to pay to out late meal.  I know I ordered the food but I did expect the manager to come something after the 2 hour ordeal. By the time we got to our hotel (8 min walk) the food was cold.

As i recall this spot was good because the prices are not off the hook and you get good portions for what you pay for.  Their breakfast and lunch meals are really good.  If you want to hit a Denny's but your spouse, partner, closet buddy, prayer champion or friend with benefits wants to try something better they will appreciate this spot.  An excellent compromise that won't leave you sleeping in the dog house.  If you have any food allergies or concerns make sure you address that when you order.  They are good about following through.  Don't forget to tip.  : )  If you want to thank me go over to Spotify or Pandora and search XTRNL and give one of my tracks a play.  We'll call it even.  Thank you.  - XTRNL",

The decorative dots of chipotle sauce on the plate were dried up, and the Benedict sauce was also hardened on the outside. Not sure if the issue was the good or the server who left our food waiting for too long.  Didn't finish even half of my meal and wasn't tempted to bring it home.",

They both looked like they'd been up all night, sort of rolled out of bed.  These guys were not around, Alex took forever and a day to take our order and kept mean mugging me when he did!! Juan kept filling everyone else's cups but ours.  Observing them with the other patrons however they managed to keep their cups full and to pull out some personality, small talk and even a smile!!    Sad to say, but it's very common that as Hispanics we get shitty service from Hispanic wait staff, I think it is a reflection of the lack of respect and community we should have and need in our culture.  I don't know for a fact but it seems other cultures don't have that \"why should I serve you\" attitude but we seem to.  My motto is all money is green, why would you lick the behinds of people from other cultures while being an \"a hole\" to your own?   For the two stooges, I have a excerpt from a famous Malcom X Speech; \"Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet?  Who taught you to hate your own kind, who taught you to hate the race that you belong to so much so, that you don't want to be around each other? You should ask yourself who taught you to hate being what god gave you?\"  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWm9pEWIPjks%26t%3D11&s=5ba1d7f73860b3fffd76e44fce7f710cc4f4f155e62184b87e88e52a171ef7d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Wm9p...</a>",

Luckily I was in vegas this past weekend for the Star Trek Convention and they had a Hash House located inside the Rio.  I ate breakfast there 3 days in a row, day 1 fried chicken benedict, day 2 chicken and waffles, and day 3 pork tenderloin benedict.  All three dished were excellent, out of the three my favorite was the pork tenderloin.  Obviously from the pictures the portions are huge, enough for breakfast and lunch.  At a price point of $20 for the entrees, its a bit more that what you would normally spend on breakfast but for the quantity, the entree is priced fairly.  Whats great about the waffles is that you get the bacon pressed in the middle and with a little syrup, its  absolutely bacon waffle heaven.  My tip is to come early for breakfast, they get quite a line after 8:30am.",

The biscuits came with a sprig of Rosemary sticking out of them that was cute but the biscuits were so old and dense they could have easily replaced the metal wheel of the tractor they had in the lobby. The potatoes were horrible boil in a bag red skin potatoes thrown onto a flat top grill and left to die, zero flavor and instead of a nice golden brown they were very burned. The fruit that was so under ripe the butter knife would not cut through the honeydew melon. We left everything on our plates except for the eggs that we ate. The bloody marys were truly the worst we have had in years, I am not sure if the mix was old or perhaps they used dishwater instead but what a waste. The waitress asked us how is it, I told her it was terrible. She never replied or came back to the table and someone else dropped off the check. Here is a hint to the kitchen and the manager when plates come back basically untouched and drinks are 95% full something is wrong do not hide from it. We went to Ellis Island Casino and had a great breakfast immediately afterwards and spent less than half of what we did at Hash House.",

Knowing it was my first time there she was really helpful with answering my questions about the menu, pointing out some fan favorites and such. I ended up ordering their version of the omelette with bacon, avacado, eggs, and potatoes.  Not sure if it's consistently like this but my dish came out literally 3 minutes after I had ordered it. It came with a lot of pleasant surprises that weren't mentioned on the menu such as a loaf of bread, a watermelon slice, and an orange slice.   Nothing to necessarily rave about but the eggs were spectacular, they were mixed in with the bacon and avacado all with melted cheese. The portion was very fair, consistent with a lot of the other reviews.   If I do return I'll have to try their chicken and waffles! Til then I'll have to save this place for emergency breakfasts when I'm at the rio. 4 stars though because of the speedy and quality service!",

The only downside of the meal was the biscuit that came with my breakfast -- hard as a rock and dry as a bone.  But the service was just bad. It took forever to get a refill on water or soda, our waitress mumbled a lot and you could hardly hear her, and she had an attitude when you asked for something. However, the lady who actually brought us our food was super nice and friendly. They should have had her wait on the tables.  Great food, bad service. At least that's better than having it the other way around",

Luckily we didn't have to wait at all at this location and we had a pretty big group too. Everyone pretty much ordered the same things. I shared with 2 of my friends. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the smoked salmon scramble and also a side of sweet potato fries. The waffles had bacon in it...and it was suprisingly amazing. I also tried a bit of my friends fried chicken benedict and it was also amazing...I don't know if the food was just tasted good because I wasn't entirely sober or if it was just that amazing. Our server kind of also convinced all of us to get mimosas. Too bad they don't offer bottomless mimosas....I'm taking a star off because the mimosa was actually really horrible. It was probably the worst mimosa I've ever had. Not sure if I'll be coming back again, but if I do, I'll probably be back more sober.",

I'm no bacon hater but it just tasted gross, like Canadian bacon or something.  The syrup was the fake crap that I do not eat, so the waffles were left dry and nasty.  I ordered a biscuit because I was craving carbs and it was gross as well.  Pillsbury has waaaayyy better ones.

I asked for another plate, they were kind enough to replace the sandwich with a mushroom hash dish. The dish was slightly less bitter but equally as dissapointing. My boyfriend got the chorizo hash. His dissatisfaction with the dish baffles me, considering you usually can't  go wrong by mixing  chorizo, potato and jalapenos. Someone in the kitchen needs to reconsider their career path.

Their coffee was mediocre but my friend got the cold brew and said it was amazing. Their fresh squeezed juices are also definitely worth it. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla which was way too big. It was stuffed with mashed potatoes and also on top of more mashed potatoes. It was a little ridiculous. My friends all got egg skillets which seemed a little more reasonable for breakfast and I tried some and they were pretty good. Their biscuits were amazing. They also have homemade jam which was out of this world. Overall, I never need to go again but it was interesting to see the huge chicken and waffles go by as people ordered them. I wouldn't wait over an hour for most things though.",

Service was OK. Flavor was OK. I've had better $2 bloody Mary's in Virginia beach than what they charge you $16 and claim to be \"famous\". 24 on zagat is more for the exaggerated plating than it is for a good quality meal.

What brought me back was seeing how great everyone else's food looked compared to mine.  I was very disappointed the first time around and had to give it another shot. I was already staying at the Rio, so this location was very convenient.  There were several things that I liked better about this Hash House than at the Imperial Palace, mostly that it felt less stuffy.  Overall, it was a much better dining experience.   My instincts to give it another shot paid off as I really enjoyed my food.  I ordered the bacon waffle, which was a waffle with bacon in the center that stuck out of each corner.  My plan was to order a waffle and a side of bacon, but this covered all my bases!  It was slightly on the salty side, but my waiter had warned me about that prior to ordering.  It was a unique and tasty breakfast plate that I thoroughly enjoyed.    My opinion of Hash House A Go Go significantly upgraded after this visit.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  There were also many other things on the menu that I would like to try and I look forward to going back.",

The oatmeal was a hit at our table and the fruit bowl they put together was pretty good. Pancake is huge.",

I've had great experiences at other HH's (San Diego and Downtown LV), but not so much at this location.    Service and everything was OK (although they forgot to bring one of our small orders and still charged for it).  No worries though, we caught it and got it fixed without problem.  The food looks pretty and abundant, but the flavors fell flat of expectation this time.  I ordered one of the Eggs Benedict and it just tasted like eating spaghetti sauce. Not enough egg benedict and too much mashed potato.  Pretty disappointing.  Everyone else also seemed to not be very impressed with their meal.  I probably would have had a better experience at Dennys, to be completely truthful.",

Make no mistake, if you are into very large portions this is the place for you. I was not impressed with the service on my last visit. More to the point it was lacking altogether. I had to keep getting up and find someone to get any attention at all. It was before closing and I think everyone was more interested in getting off work than taking care of the few customers they had in the store. Also, three of the four entree's were served and the fourth entree came out later. I have no idea what that was about. Meanwhile, our food got cold waiting for the last entree to be served. As for the food, their presentation may be over the top, but the quality of their food is not. They are about quantity over quality. Lastly, we couldn't find anyone to give us our check and pay our bill. The whole experience was disappointing to say the least. As you can surmise, I am in no hurry to return.",

I usually am a fan of restaurants that cater to just a certain type of menu, because it means that they actually provide great foods for that menu alone. Hash House does breakfast/brunch items, which sounds great on paper.   I ordered the steak and eggs, around $20 for the plate. Asked for steak medium and eggs scrambled   I'm sure the casual diner will love the runny eggs, with juice oozing out of, but scrambled to me shouldn't be runny, so I was not a big fan of it at all. While I know that there's nothing worse than overcooked eggs, watery undercooked are not my thing so have that in mind.   The steak was just....bland. Not bad just, nothing that would make me want to go back. The side of hash was good though. so I really enjoyed it, but that's about it.",

This isn't a place to go out of your way for, but when it's convenient, it's great.  We ordered family style, and ordered way too much. The three of us shared:  Chicken and Waffles ---- Yummy (not mind-blowing, but yummy nonetheless) and ridiculous in proportion (check out other peoples' photos to verify) and quite unique.  Side Salad --- Not sure what the dressing was, but it was good. Everything was fresh.  Healthy Breakfast, Egg White Omelette with Fruit --- Good, for healthy food.  My cousin also got a Bloody Mary. She really liked it; I never fancied the taste of tomato juice, especially spicy tomato juice, but she said it was really good.   Service was OK. Nothing bad, except she could've been quicker on the water refills. I never hit bottom on my coffee because those refills came quickly, but the coffee was pretty much water to me. (Not terrible, but not amazing coffee, either)  Overall, I'll probably come here again if I stay at the Rio, and try some other dishes. Bring friends so you can share... or not :)",

Came here again for Halloween with very high expectations. It was a Sunday morning but surprisingly it was not busy at all. We were seated right away.  We then waited literally 20 minutes for someone to take our drinks orders. We saw a server walk back and forth between tables near us catering to those tables needs but we thought \"that can't possibly be our server, he would've definitely attended to us by now as he obviously can see we've been sitting with no drinks for so long.\" He walked away and another man who seemed to be a busser came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. No \"good morning\",  no \"welcome\", just \"what would you like to drink\". But we didn't even care, we were starving and had waited enough. As he brought back our drinks he stated,  \"I'll go get your server.\"  Turns out the original guy who had been avoiding our table was our server. He also didn't say hello or introduce himself as our server, just asked, \"any questions?\"  We ordered. 10 minutes later our food came out but by another busser. Not once did our server stop by and ask us how food was, if we needed anything else, nothing. We finished our food a good 15 minutes before he brought us our bill. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there. Keep in mind this entire time the server had been attending to the tables around us every 5 minutes.  The food was not great, maybe it was because I had my hopes so high. I would've preferred the Dennys next to the Venetian with the 40 minute wait and gotten better food and service. Im not giving up on the hash house, I'm coming back in December but probably to the one at the Linq since it has better reviews.  Steer away from this one. I have never not tipped a server in my entire life until this trip....",

Flavors were good. My only complaint was that the chicken was dry. 2nd meal was The Kokomo-Griddled meatloaf, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella on old fashioned milk bread. It was really great. The 3rd and last meal was my favorite. Chicken Pot Pie-Roasted chicken, pan gravy, farm fresh veggies in an upside down cracker crust shell. It was fantastic. All the servings are huge. The wait staff was excellent. Would go again.",

The waiter was trying to get us to be adventurous with Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit which by the way was excellent. The Stolichnaya spicy bloody mary is a hit, don't go for the take home sparkle glass unless you can drop it in in your room after eating. My son had the Traditional Buttermilk 12\" Flapjack w/ brown sugar & Banana. Also, quite tasty.  I would rather miss three meals just so I can enjoy this type of good cook'in.

It was definitely pricey ($50 for breakfast), but the portions are HUGE!  My hubby got the flapjack and it was the size of a monster truck tire...he can put away some food and was only able to eat half of it. I got their famous fried chicken and it had a maple reduction on it that I could have done without. The biscuit was big and came with a delicious blueberry preserve. Now, for my favorite part of the meal..the griddle cooked mashed potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had!!!!  Even after I felt like I was gonna need wheeled out on a gurney from eating to much, I ate some more of those mashed potatoes!  They were chunky red potatoes seasoned perfectly then put on a hot griddle to get a nice crust on the outside. Absolutely brilliant.  I had the strawberry lemonade. It was good, but I expected more from $5 a glass and $1 for refills. My husband got a mint cappuccino and raved about it. I asked to substitute my bacon for chicken sausage and the waitress came back to me and said the chef said no...which was annoying but not a huge deal.  All in all, very good food and big portions. We left overstuffed, and needing to sleep off a food coma. We also left with empty pockets, so we will save going back for special occasions.",

A mountain of soggy home style potatoes topped with a minimal amount of corned beef and hardly any cheese. the biscuit looked better than it tasted too. the biscuit was dry and crumbled instead of flaked apart. the corned beef was bland and dry, and the cheese did not help.   I don't know what kind of jam they brought out, but I put some on the biscuit and it tasted like a pixie stick. way too much sugar.  Nobody really enjoyed their meals this morning. What a shame.",

It was a huge amount of food and they could have shared it. It was greasy, which I supposed someone hung over may enjoy, but they weren't eating off a hangover. Fruit was served with it which is nice considering the grease bomb of a meal. Our other friends meal was just as greasy so it wasn't just the meatloaf.  We have tried the other Hash HouseAGoGo in the Plaza years ago and don't remember it being so greasy. I can't saw we will be back",

    "text": "Check out day, every Vegas visitor's dreaded day. Not many people look forward to leaving Sin City and the drive/flight back to reality. Having $10 worth of dining credit to use, I decided to hit up Hash House for breakfast before I got on the road.  Having bad arthritis in both hips, it's difficult for me to sit down/get up from normal tables. So if possible, I try to find places with high top tables or a bar to sit at. I was in luck! The Tractor Bar was open with Bobby as my server/bartender. From the start he was very friendly, personable and attentive. I opted for a Bloody Mary to start my day. Having seen it on the Caesar's promo TV channel in the room, it looked delicious! The only drawback was they showed & said that it came with a strip of bacon in it. Mine didn't have one. However, it had a garden of produce on top of it that was delicious! The standard olives, sweet gherkin pickles, a lemon wedge and these delicious pickled green beans known as \"hot dilly beans\". Those were so tasty and unusual (at least to me) that I had to ask Bobby what they were. He showed me the jar and I immediately wrote down the product & manufacturer's names for later! Bobby even gave me a small plate of them to enjoy while I perused the menu.  Everything on the menu sounds (and I'm sure tastes) fantastic. I had narrowed my choice down to chicken fried steak & eggs or their signature chicken pot pie. I asked Bobby which he would suggest and he said that they're both very good. Having not had a pot pie in years and having them as a staple growing up as a kid, I decided to go with the chicken pot pie. Not to mention that I saw it on the promo channel in the room as well and it looked awesome. Bobby warned me that it was a good sized portion and he wasn't kidding! If you order it, I recommend you bring either one heck of an appetite or at least 1 other friend to share it with. The pot pie was OMGDelicious! The gravy was creamy, lots of decent sized chunks of chicken that were quite tasty and the vegetables were cooked to a perfect al dente where they still had good flavor and a slight snap when you bit into them. The crust \"hat\" was crisp & flaky with a light buttery flavor to it.  I made it through about 1/3 of the chicken pot pie before I had to call it quits. Any more to eat and my drive home later that morning would have been uncomfortable. Bobby even offered me some more of the pickled green beans and I had to turn him down! I asked for a box and put the rest of my meal in it to take with. The crust \"hat\" is rather big, so I broke it up and rested it on top of the filling. This is where the only negative aspect of the visit came in to play...  Being ecologically minded, Hash House uses to go containers made from compressed paper, most likely recycled as well. Unfortunately, with the wetness of the pot pie gravy, that box never stood a chance. It quickly became damp & soft, flexing in the middle due to the weight and weakened structure of the fibers. It did make it back to L.A. in fairly decent shape, but I would recommend they use something a little more sturdy & moisture/liquid resistant for their to go containers with items like this.  During the drive home to L.A., I snacked on some of the pieces of crust \"hat\" that were broken up in the box. I also had some of the left overs for breakfast this morning. And I still have enough left for another meal! Like I said, Bobby wasn't kidding about it being a good sized portion!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will DEFINITELY return to a Hash House location!!  Service - 5 Food - 5 Drinks - 5 Use of paper to go container for wet products - 3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall review - 4",

My friends scrambled eggs were disgusting seemed like boxes egg because of the rubbery texture and clear liquid that leaked from them.  She liked the potatoes.  I got the traditional eggs Benedict I did not enjoy it at all.  Partially my fault because I didn't fully read the description because I thought based on the title of the entree it would be actually like a traditional eggs Benedict.   The eggs were fried not poached which was fine but the sauce was a \"red pepper cream\" that tasted like spegettit sauce  and my spoked bacon had a ton of inedible raw fat.  The sauce didn't blend with the overall dish and it was hard to eat even though I was pretty hungry .  The potato mash part was really good but that's it.  They also provide a strawberry and blueberry jam condiment with all breakfast orders that's really good.",

I don't expect much from a waiter but our server Brian did a terrible job. He became agitated and upset when I asked him if they could possible remake some eggs I ordered that had onions in them. He replied, \"it's clearly written on the menu!\" Then he grabbed my entire plate and once it was return the biscuit was missing. He never once checked on us to see how we were doing and we had to track him down twice through other waiters to get his attention. We were the only African- Americans in the restaurant so I don't know if that played any role, but I definitely won't be coming back.. I left a note.. No tip do to bad service and I'm a generous tipper who doesn't write reviews.. So what does that tell you.. Do better brian",

    "text": "Second time in this location.  Frequent the location on Sahara. Food and service always top notch, the Rio location, quite the antithesis. Coincidently, both times here my same friend and I were waited on by Laura. First time she was less than friendly and short, this morning she was flat out rude and borderline hateful. No exaggeration. I ordered the salmon biscuits( as usual ) this time I asked for salmon on the side instead of on top. Simple right? Her reply, \"Nope sorry can't do that.\" I explained that I don't want extra or anything taken out just simply on the side instead of on top. Her reply, \" Nope! Nope! We can't do that we are a franchise store and we have to make everything the exact same way.\"  No sorry. No let me check on that for you no courtesy and no respect. Her tone was loud enough that the booth next to us all stopped their convo and was into ours with Laura. I know they can't add or sub at this place, neither of which I was asking for, but was very rudely denied!  I knew the policies of this place as I eat here frequently! This was simply a case of a rotten attitude and an extremely condescending disposition. From go she was not polite and had us waiting when the place was bare @ 9am. I know when I'm being judged and I was.  My friend and I had work out clothes on and shades and baseball caps and apparently it was off putting to Laura. Or maybe it was our smell. We smelt of roses and Lilacs. Or maybe it was our hair, we had ponytails. I wouldn't dare believe for one second she assumed we were going to share the plate and didn't want to accommodate my needs. And I would fall off a cliff before I believe it was because of the color of our skin. Either way, I was so so upset at the way I was treated by her. I can't explain the anger and frustration of her condescending attitude towards us. I spoke with Michael who was the Starbucks manager and let him know of my experience and he listened and agreed she was wrong for denying us our request and pretty much just stood there. He saw I was frustrated and my friend was very calm and polite as was I but I was on the verge of tears. As they fell I walked away and said good day.  I couldn't take it. My morning had already been ruined by this sour woman and no apologies were made. The manager listened but may as well been a suggestion box. This type of behavior and blatant denial of service should be addressed immediately and rectified to at least some of the customers satisfaction and it was not. I walked off in tears. The Rio should know that their employees can make a local with a sevens card never walk foot into the Rio again, and I won't.",

    "text": "There are very few disaster scenarios where a positive thinker like myself would give a 1 star rating, let alone a 1 star rating to an outpost of one of my favorite restaurants.  As an executive who has to recruit top talent, if someone is visiting Vegas for breakfast - I typically would take them to the Sahara Hash House as my \"closing\" move.  But like everything else in the Rio, there is little redeeming value here (the lone exception is Penn and Teller - 5 star show!).  Hash House SHOULD REPRESENT more than just twisted farm food, more than just gigantic portions, and more than just a restaurant frequently associated with man vs. food alumni lists.    Hash House Sahara has great service.  Love and integrity put into the food.  And is just lovable and quaint.  Top 5 reasons this one is wayyyy different (with anecdotes):  1 - Servers who do not care.  I am a 30%+ tipper where service is exceptional, and 20% when it is even below average.  I had to resort to a 15% tip today.  I have gone 20 years of my life without drinking coffee - the taste has a psychological flashback effect for me which is traumatizing.  Every time I order a hot chocolate, I always freeze in fear \"is this going to be the time someone screws up my order?\"  20 years, thousands of hot chocolates later, no issue.  Until today.  Decades of fear have been re-instigated instead of subsided.  I ordered a hot chocolate and the waitress heard me, and even prepared it the exact same way a Hash House hot chocolate arrives at your table (of course this one was severely late).  She even called out to the bar \"do you have my hot chocolate?\"  She could see the panic in my face when I asked - because this mug did not look like the typical Hot Chocolate Hash House mug.  One gulp later, my meal (and memory) were both ruined.  She left it on the bill, despite seeing its replacement hot chocolate untouched. and me spitting for a while.  2 - This is a keno bar disguised as a restaurant.  There's a keno runner yelling and walking around interrupting everyone's meal.  I saw no takers today - but I did see annoyed patrons.  3 - I told the waitress we were in a rush, and asked for the check (when you ask for the check, the waitress should be sensitive and aware that there might be a rush of some kind).  When she arrived with the check, my wallet was out and I was selecting which card to use.  She said she would be right back, and then served 3 other tables without returning.  No apologies.    4 - I asked for a side of bacon.  My non-bacon eating friend had it on the side of her plate, not mine.    5 - Everything was overcooked - from a simple pancake to a simple sunny side up egg.  I have eaten at Hash House Sahara probably 20x, and never had food or service this bad.  RIP...",

We waited for a half hour to even get in to the restaurant, and when we did, it was another 10 minutes before we were seated. When we sat down, we were given menus, then left alone for 25 minutes whilst the waitress fiddled around with other tables around us. We ordered drinks, then were left alone for another 15 minutes before the waitress finally came back. When we asked for any substitutions on the menu (as we don't eat pork), it took the waitress 45 minutes to get back to us. We finally ordered, and sat around waiting. We had been told the food would be 25 minutes. 25 minutes later, the manager came out to see how we were doing. Her mistake. We complained to her about how much time we had spent waiting, and asked her to check on our meal, and turn the head banging music down. She came out and told us our meal had only been ordered for 10 minutes. As if. We paid for our coffees and left. Moral of the story, do not go if you are impatient or don't have 3 hours to waste.",

I ordered a bacon waffle, declining the waiters instruction to take the more expensive chicken & waffle.  It had very little flavor, and the strips of bacon inserted crosswise inside were flavorless. The only taste came from the powdered sugar and syrup.  My friend had the chorizo hash. He was not at all impressed saying the flavor was ok but the dish just average and the chorizo came as not nearly small enough cubes mixed in looking more like too- large cubes of ham. It was mild bland chorizo with little flavor.  The food came out of the kitchen quick enough. My request for an iced tea refill was acknowledged by the waiter who subsequently passed by 4-5 times without delivering. We ended up having to flag down the neighboring waiter to ask for the bill and left minus the refill, but with no intent on returning. Absolutely have no reason to return. I can enjoy a far better breakfast at Original Pancake House and my friend said he's had better at IHOP.",

My husband's food came 20 minutes before mine. The waiter grabbed his manager and she came over and apologized. We didn't ask for her, but it was a nice gesture. The manager took my husband's dish back to bring the two dishes out together & warm. The food was ok. Our drinks were never refilled & we waited 30 minutes from finishing our meal to have a bus boy ask us if we needed our check. We have seen 2 other tables be frustrated with incorrect dishes being brought out to them. Save yourselves the trouble & go to the Hash House on the strip.",

Even though the manager comped our cold food this was only due to the fact we stopped him And asked for him to come over. Just was a little upsetting after waiting 30 min for a table, 30 min for our food which we only received 1/2 our order. Another plate came 15 min later and our last plate never came. We let the waitress know that we don't want the plate anymore we get a reply ok good.  Hmmm if you don't mind poor service and taking the chance of your food not showing  then go here. There was other things wrong as well like the general manager sitting there laughing and chatting away with the head chef while he texted for 10-15 min and the kitchen we were told was very backed. I don't know about them but if I was the manager and head chef I would be back there trying to do everything I can to get us caught up. Just very disappointing",

I recommend you split a plate if you are visiting because it will just go to waste if you can't take it back to your hotel room. I had their version of the Reuben sandwich and that was some of the best corned beef I've ever had.  my friend had the banana pancake; imagine Bananas Foster with pancake batter for it over the top of it into a 12 inch skillet 1\" thick size of heaven. I would have gave it 5 stars easily but service was pretty bad we only got our drinks once we never got offered refills. Our server was very persistent in upselling certain items. He made it very obvious that they were trying to sell specific menu items today.  The food did come out fast and you could certainly tell it. Was made from scratch. I highly recommend this place if you come to Vegas. Just maybe try one of the other locations. I will definitely come back and eat here each time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "god, where do I start? my wife and I normally choose not to eat at corporate restaurants, but when you're stuck in a las vegas hotel, there is nothing else.  we were seated promptly and we each ordered a different hash; she, the \"famous\" meatloaf hash, I, corned beef hash and a $3.99, upsell, side of gravy. our food arrived before we had drunk even half a cup of some pretty good coffee.  ladies first. my wife's \"hash\" consisted of cubes of meatloaf, a wad of red peppers, a handful of uncooked spinach and some half melted white cheese served over a pile of old soggy steam table potato cubes. other than a quick minute under the broiler to melt the cheese, it appeared as though nothing had been really cooked together. I found the meatloaf to be tasteless as well. as for the corned beef hash, the same nasty potatoes appeared as the base, over which they had strewn long tough strings of tasteless corned beef held in a wad by some melted swiss? cheese. any chef should know to cut corned beef across the grain to make it tender. I have never seen corned beef served this way. and hope never to again. the biscuits were beautiful, high and golden. but were cold as a witches heart. the $3.99 side of sausage gravy... where I'm from gravy has always been somewhat liquid. but not at hash house a go go. try to run your biscuit through it and the biscuit just crumbles. I got the attention of a manager, I believe his name was mr. dean, and told him of my thoughts on our breakfasts. like a True company trained manager he took the $3.99 side of gravy off our $45.00 bill. he agreed that it should have been liquid. so, $41.05 (plus tip) later, I received another lesson in corporate restaurant incompetence. without employees who truly care about the customer, and who take pride in doing their job, one will face long odds of getting served a good meal when dining out.",

Seems like they inundate the plate with high carbs dishes like biscuits and mashed potatoes to compensate for the paltry quantity of proteins.  The dish arrived cold.  Not great for something served with a sauce.  The MU did like the deep fried spaghetti strands served as garnish - an idea he plans to steal.  We arrived before the rush hit and only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The server was very attentive, except when we were ready to leave and couldn't find him to request our bill.

I'm gonna definitely give the portions 2 thumbs up while the food itself is decent.  Our party got the following...  Steak and eggs Cornbeef Fried chicken and waffles Mushroom and swiss burger.  Though that the food was decent perhaps due to the enormous size of the plates, but when I wanted to go back and have the rest, it was already cold...  Steak and eggs were exactly what they are... Cornbeef is a little on the dry side Mushroom and swiss burger is slightly salty, but I'm sure it had like 3 lbs of meat on the single patty... crazy! Then the fried chicken and waffles, 3 towering sage fried chicken residing over 4 bacon waffles...  Flavor was ok but I didn't know how to deconstructed before engaging....  Yes.. it was that huge!  So here are the pros and cons...  Pros:   Portion size! Bang for your buck! Relaxed atmosphere Guarantee leftovers  Cons:  Size:  Is too big a problem? Flavor, seems to be just like any other breakfast joint Price:  Slightly pricey for those people who have a small appetite, but if you are hungry I'm sure the price will be very reasonable.  Will I go back... I don't think out of the way but if friends wanted to go back and have breakfast together I'll probably make a visit.",

A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing.

After 10-15 minutes our waiter finally showed up (one of the 3 times we would actually see him).  If that wasn't bad enough, our food took over half an hour and when we got it, it was barely lukewarm!!!  The servers who brought us the food mentioned it was sitting in the kitchen for a while because there was no table number for it - a likely cause of why our food was cold.  We finally tracked down our waiter after 10 minutes but obviously weren't going to send the food back because it would have taken forever.  The waiter was nice enough to consult his manager and give us a discount on our meal but the damage was done.  It's hard to judge if the food is really that good here since everything we ate was pretty much cold.  The fried chicken had good flavor and was crispy but it would have tasted so much better hot.  My friends who got potatoes and eggs were not impressed and all of our biscuits were basically rock hard and dry.  Maybe in the fuutre I will try a different location but until then, Hash House A Go Go at the Rio - you have failed me!",

It even smelled foul. He wanted to alert management so that they could correct the situation, ensure it didn't happen to others and share his concern that we had no idea what he was really drinking. First we asked the keno girl for help. She said she couldn't help us. She sent over the hostess who had no response except to say she'd get the manager. About 5 minutes later she returned to tell us that the manager was in a meeting and she'd send the chef to talk to us. After 15 minutes of waiting we approached her again and told her we were completely dissatisfied and we didn't have more time to wait. She had no response. This lack of customer concern and disgusting food service has left us frustrated and disgruntled. We won't return to hash house.",

My bro in law said the plates were big, but hey, I've dealt with big plates before.    So I asked the server, what's good for breakfast and she said the Benny something, I forgot name.  I didn't notice that next to it, it said \"a Man versus Food favorite\". Well, when I received plate, goodness gracious!   It was a beast!  A platter with a base of hash browns, two huge biscuits, tomatoes and a monstrous piece of chicken fried steak.  All drowned in chipotle sauce.  Then there was a steak knife stabbed right down the middle.  I started like a man, but ended a whimpering child.    If your not a breakfast person, go and order a Mcsomething.  But for a manly breakfast, swing on by.  On this occasion, man lost!",

The corned beef hash was decent and the home style potatoes were okay but overall it was not a dish that made me want to come back for more. The portions are generous.  The waiter was friendly, quick, and attentive. Overall experience was 30 minutes because it was early on a Saturday morning.",

Poached eggs came in hard, that should indicate to you their \"finer\" cooking abilities in the kitchen.   I asked the kitchen to return the hard eggs for over easy poached eggs.  Besides that the meal is a good brunch filler.   Service were attentive and there wasn't a line when we walked in during the morning.  But as soon as we walked out there was a short line by 12:30PM.    As far as our dish, the chorizo hash had a choice between flour tortilla and the biscuit.  Don't select the latter the flavors doesn't work.  They're both too heavy and the tortilla would have been a better balance.  Where you can scoop the hash like a breakfast taco.  The mushroom veggie hash was a lighter and healthier dish yet bland.  It was lacking the right spices to add a certain specialness.  Prices were moderate for two close to $40 with unlimited coffee.    I'll probably return whenever I visit Vegas again.  But this time I'm sharing a hash dish the portion is sufficient for a lumber jack!",

Basically you are not greeted or acknowledged by the grumpy hostess who appears to not care one way or another about you sitting or for her even being there.  But if you are a \"platinum\" card carrier you are sort of acknowledged by a grunt.  So when we were led to our table she cleared her throat for us to follow.  You should also wear many layers of clothing, jacket, mittens, hat, as it is freezing and there is a definite artic wind that is blowing. We were however promptly greeted by the drink fetcher and our server Keith.  Our orders were taken with no problem. The food here is awesome and you get a lot of it.  The jam spread is delicious.  If you can get toast the rude hostesses and the arctic conditions its great.",

The food is way to much. Flavor of the chicken is good. Waffles as well. I think if they leaf the fried chicken a bit less frying like 3 min. It would hold it's juices better and would be so dry. The plate itself becomes a mess on a plate. Sorry but the chef is not working on presentation. I'm sure you would not find this in Rio. That why I give 3 starts. Not sure if I would eat it again.

When you're hungover the last thing you want is to sit and have breakfast in a clustered restaurant. The service is always pretty awesome. Iv never had a bad experience   The best thing on the menu is definitely the chicken and waffles. The portion is enough to feed two people. The rest of the menu is pretty awesome. They don't have hash browns which is a bit surprising given the name of this place. For those looking for healthier alternatives, they have the option of substituting  with egg whites and are very good with modifying anything on the menu to fit your needs. They also have a low calorie \"healthy section\" on the menu.    The price isn't too bad everything is under $15 for a pretty generous serving (except the healthy menu)   You won't be disappointed in giving this place a shot",

I ordered the chicken farm scramble and my sister ordered the meatloaf hash. The biscuit was my favorite part! They give you blueberry preserves to spread on the biscuit - a very pleasant, delicious surprise. There was a lot of tender, well seasoned chicken in my scramble, along with cheese and peppers. I got the grilled mashed potatoes on the side. This almost felt like dinner for breakfast, but I'm the type who loves that! There are more traditional breakfast options if that's your thing. Tried a bite of the meatloaf. It was ok. However, my sister was a fan and really enjoyed it. Again, more like dinner than breakfast.   I'm going with four stars because the large portions are not worth it in Vegas. Like, I'm on vacation and not taking leftovers. I'm on the move too much. Plus, we ate here right before checking out. Taking leftovers weren't even an option. I wish there was an option to get the same menu option but in a smaller size for a little less.",

I paid extra to have the extra item of mushroom and it was not worth it. The scramble was so dry and the potatoes were over seasoned it had a weird after taste. The little service interaction I had was uncomfortable, it seemed the guy that took my order at the bar was having a bad day.   The 2nd time, I went with my family and dined in. I had another scramble with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes and spinach. Again the scramble was very dry and potatoes over seasoned. None of us enjoyed our food and definitely the most expensive meal we had that we basically didn't eat.   The menu here is slight different from San Diego location. The service is not great at we wait 15-20 min to place our order and to pay our bill. This place does not even compare to the one in San Diego! The only good thing about this place is there's never a wait.",

The item I had to share was the one made famous by Man V Food. The mashed potatoes, the biscuits, the fried chicken... food coma ensued.

    "text": "Another one of the dining offerings in the Las Vegas Rio casino, Hash House A Go-Go is a chain of eateries that features heartland-inspired cuisine and portions that would literally choke a Great White Shark!  WHO SHOULD GO: Trenchermen, anyone who loves classic American cuisine, anyone who loves Claim Jumper.  WHO SHOULDN'T: Anyone who is height/weight proportionate, and would like to stay that way, and solo diners.  THE ROSES: Don't expect anything sophisticated or exotic here; this is stick-to-your-ribs-pickup-truck-driving-trucker-cap-wearing-plumber's-butt-jeans style chow, but it is damn tasty! I had and truly enjoyed the chicken and waffles, even though I could feel my cardiovascular system closing up just looking at it. Bloody Marys are divine, and the service is quite good.  THE THORNS: Portion sizes so large, it's actually immoral! If there's an obesity epidemic in America, places like this are squarely to blame. My chicken & waffles could have honestly been shared by 2 hungry people, or three normal appetites! I'm all for value, but this is ridiculous! I saw a LOT of half-eaten plates being cleared away by the busboys, not because the food was bad, but because (a) there is no way in hell you can finish, and (b) get real, no one is going eat what they take in a doggie bag. The hotel staff will be cleaning it out of your room fridge when you leave! This level of wastage is simply wrong, when you think of all the hunger in the world (or even here in the USA!). Staffing is a problem too. during the breakfast rush, there was a huge line of people wanting in, but some sections remained closed off simply because there was a lack of staff to serve the tables.  THE VERDICT: Tasty food is the draw, but huge portions make it a bad place for the solo diner who has no one to share an entree with. When you carry the 'monster portion' shtick to this level of ridiculousness, I have to dock you TWO stars. If the portion sizes were more reasonable, I'd have given this restaurant a 4-star rating. When you wonder why America in general, and Vegas in particular, is overrun by fatties (and yes, I KNOW that not all overweight people have any control over their weight, but let's face it, most DO, and places like this are simply enabling those future diabetics.  TOP TIP: If you're going for breakfast, GO EARLY, otherwise you will be stuck in a long, slow line waiting for a table.  PARTHIAN SHOT: In the interest of full disclosure, let me say I'm no fan of what Las Vegas has become. The former haunt of the likes of classy Rat Packers like Frank, Dean, Sammy, et al. has been replaced by chubby heartland rubes wearing fanny packs and flip-flops. The words of British bicycle designer Mike Burrows, when touring the US, come to mind:  \"Marin County (California) was wonderful. The whole town had nothing but beautiful people. I think there must've been an ordinance banning stupid and ugly people within city limits.  Then I came to Las Vegas and realized what they had done with them all.\"",

    "text": "Ate here on 1/2/15 before we headed back home. Let's start with the basics. Ambiance was nice, staff were friendly and our server was very attentive. Menu choices were just enough, I don't like too too many options because then it takes to long to decide what I want.  Now onto the food, Hubby ordered the Steak & Eggs and I opted for the Biscuits & Gravy. The first not so great thing was the diced red/yellow bell peppers and green onions they sprinkled on both of our plates, I'm guessing it was for \"presentation\". Well I wasn't impressed because I don't like bell peppers and it wasn't a big deal for my hubby to scrape it off his steak but I had sausage gravy, so it was like digging for unwanted treasure to get it off.  The sausage gravy was awesome by the way, so were the mashed potatoes, biscuits unfortunately weren't they were dense and pretty dry. You think mine being slathered in gravy would of helped loosen them up but NOPE.  Hubby's steak was good even though it was more cooked to my liking which is medium rare, and he ordered medium, he also asked for no tomatoes and yeah they put tomatoes on his. He chose the crispy potatoes instead of mashed and wasn't too impressed, said they were kinda dry and not evenly seasoned.   All in all it was a meh experience, portions seem to be more of their strong point. We'd maybe try another of their locations to give it another shot but not sure about this one.   Did I mention that their sausage gravy was still awesome though ;-)",

Although the fried chicken was dried, the breading was nice and crispy. The plate had everything I could imagine for breakfast on it; eggs, bacon, biscuits, potatoes, hollandaise sauce, and fried chicken. My family throughly enjoyed it.  We also ordered the Texas Ranchero, grilled chicken hash and #5 burger. The Texas ranchero was the second favorite, then the burger, and lastly the hash. The hash was the only item, that was kind of disappointing. It lacked flavor and grandness the other dishes had.  The service was okay, nothing spectacular. Once seated, the waitress did not take our drink order for a while, nor refill our waters through the meal. The atmosphere was not spectacular either. There were some interesting items on display, like the open oven roasting chicken, but the restaurant lacked small touches. Little things that would have made the theme of farm to table more prevalent.",

However, if you just really want to try the Hash House A Go-Go chain, visit their other locations (I'd suggest the more local one on Sahara). This Hash House definitely has a casino-feel to it, and is not very \"homey.\" Therefore I didn't expect much going in. The Andy's sage fried chicken that we ordered came with very hard and old-tasting biscuits, and the chicken was more on the dry side. However, their sauces and portion sizes were great. Be sure to SHARE when you are here! Also try some of their coffee options. I was conflicted between the banana latte and the frosted mint latte. I did enjoy the latter.  Service was meh. Our waitress was just a little inattentive, but what can you expect from a quick casino diner?",

I ordered the chicken and waffles as I had been told this was the bomb. The chicken was not good. I thought when I cut into this it would be a beautiful piece of breast meat with a wonderful fried chicken coating, it was not.  The chicken, was good, once I found it. It was so thin and covered with so much breading.  Also the skin was still on the chicken but it was not crunchy, it was like the chicken had been boiled and then a crunchy breading applied to the outside.  The service was good except our server talked one of our party out of ordering a order of pancakes saying the one he was getting with his order was so big he wouldn't need anymore.  Wrong, pancake was not big and my friend was wondering why the server did that.  There are so many other places to have breakfast in Las Vegas consider eating somewhere else.",

I was seated quickly and proceeded to order the famed corned beef hash with sunny side eggs. The portion was large with plenty of beef but probably too much in terms of potatoes vs other ingredients which included Swiss cheese, green onions, diced tomatoes, and peppers. Overall, the skillet was delicious and the fruit garnish was a nice side. Personally, the biscuit felt a bit off but the butter and jam made it more palatable. The meal kept my hunger at bay until a late dinner.",

    "text": "My previous experiences at Hash House A Go Go (at the Linq) have been great, but my last visit to the Rio location left a lot to be desired. Rio location is set quite a walk away from the main casino area & is closer to the usually quiet convention center space.  Hours are limited to 6A-1P; so no late night dinners here.  There was no line when we came by on Sunday around 11AM...but when we were being seated, the hostess took us to a dirty table (without settings & dirty plates left behind). She quickly wiped up the mess & promptly left before we could tell her that one of the chairs had milk spilled on it. Unable to flag down one of the servers for help (none would make eye contact or acknowledge our current predicament), I took matters into my own hands & grabbed a chair from another empty (but dirty) table.  The table we had was sticky in several spots and it took a considerable amount of time to notify a bus boy about it (it was acknowledged but no action was taken). Yet again, I got up and grabbed some napkins from the server stand to cover the mess.  Food met expectations, but extra care should have been taken to ensure proper utensils were provided...as I had to ask for a steak knife (for steak & eggs) and requested straws for our drinks (long after the server had dropped them off and promptly moved away to another table).  Overall: Decent location to have the Man V. Food portions of food we've all come to expect from HH...just try to eat here early..before the tables & seats get messed up.",

The fried chicken was interesting. It was coated with corn flake batter (seemingly), but lacked in flavor. The chicken pieces itself were actually small, and the batter was heavy, but pleasantly crisp. I pulled off the batter and picked at it. The chicken was very moist.   The waffles were stuffed with bacon. Yup, you read right, BACON! I had no clue until I started ripping in between the waffle squares in the midst of feeling like I was having a heart attack.    If you're on a low cholesterol diet, DO NOT ORDER this dish. This dish should come with a nutritional warning.   Overall, good service. They kept the coffee coming and hot!",

We sat down ordered and was presented our meals in 10 min. Really though!!! How is that even possible. I know it's all pre made and put under warmers like KFC. HOW NASTY!! Never coming back or recommending! Oh let me add the total time including valet check in (which isn't free) and out was 25 min.",

Not much conversation from the bartender but I'm cool with that. He was very focused and fast!  Pros: Service was quick. Orders were taken, prepared and served promptly.  Portions are HUGE. I had a whole itinerary for food for the day and literally my one pancake made it to where I didn't need to eat anymore... and I can eat when I want to. One pancake at 11:30 am lasted me an entire day. It's basically a lazy susan sized pancake.  The apple slices in my apple cinnamon pancake were both large and fresh. Not too crunchy, not too mushy.   Hot chocolate: So I accidentally ordered the smores mocha instead of the classic hot chocolate (definitely my mistake, I don't even like coffee). However, the large marshmallows, graham cracker and torch they used to melt it were so delicious I ended up drinking more of it than I expected.   Cool diner like atmosphere that had the basketball game on at the bar.  Cons:  I came there to try the strawberry frosted flake pancake I saw on the online menu but this location doesn't have it. Apparently only certain locations do. No big deal, but it really was the dish that intrigued me to check the place out in the first place. Would have been fun to try.  I like my pancakes soft and fluffy. Some people like theirs with a little crisp on the edges (my wife). My apple cinnamon pancakes were slightly under-cooked even for me. I think with the size of the pancake, it might be tougher to get it to cook all the way through without some parts burning. Inside parts of the pancake had a slight mushiness to it.  I tasted my friends chicken and waffles. I don't eat bacon (yea I know... cue the boos) and these have bacon in them. That said, the waffle was good and the bacon actually wasn't that bad either. It was thick enough to where it tasted more like a piece of meat than the little slither of crisp most places serve. However, I didn't really like the chicken. There was a bunch of extra stuff on it (leeks and sage and whatnot) but the actual chicken itself needed a little more seasoning in my opinion.  All in all, if and when I return to Vegas, I would go again but it wouldn't be a priority. I want to try the stuffed french toast. My Lyft driver was raving about it and a few of the reviews I read concur. I also want to try the strawberry kiwi watermelon drink they had at the bar. I really wanted one but I drank so much the day before I needed a break.",

I like to go around 8 am because around 9 am I've seen the line go all the way to Starbucks!  I've tried most of the menu, but my favorites are the classic 2 eggs, potatoes, meat, and biscuit.  I also like their sage fried chicken, fried pork tenderloin, and their corned beef.  The coating on the chicken and tenderloin is very good.  The corned beef comes shredded and it is flavorful.    I really like going to Hash House, but after eating there twice I really wanted something a bit healthier.  It's definitely a place to splurge on your diet that could easily become two meals.",

This place is huge, so there are plenty of seats. I came here on a Sunday morning, and there was no wait. We got seated immediately and our food came out right away. Three girls shared two dishes. The portions here are large.   We tried an egg scramble which came with chicken (don't remember the name. It was nothing special, but it was also kind of weird to eat eggs with chicken. It also came with a biscuit and jam. The jam was delicious. It also came with a huge side of potatoes, which were also pretty good.   We also ordered the vanilla waffle combo. This was definitely the better dish. The waffle came with eggs and your choice of breakfast meat.   This was a good option for a quick breakfast, but there's enough food on one plate to share between two people.",

Pros: + Waiter Jose, was very nice and friendly. It seemed as if they were under staffed that day as he was serving many tables at once. But he was still very helpful.  + Clean restaurant, interesting decor + Food portions were huge, tasted...just okay.   Cons: - Although portions are huge food is just okay, nothing great. We had two orders of the egg Benedict (not sure if it was noted on the menu) came with a type of red spaghetti sauce, which was rather odd to us.       - Extremely rude busser, wasn't pleasant or friendly. At one point the guy on the table next to use asked him for the check since he was the only one there at the moment, and he replied in a harsh manner, \"I'm not your waiter\" and continues to do what he was doing. He could of at least said let me get your waiter for you.  Overall experience was okay, don't think it'll be on our 'must do' list next vegas trip.",

We arrived about 10 minutes before they closed and I wish they had turned us away. My daughter and I ordered the chicken and waffles which looked amazing at first glance. Once we cut into the chicken we realized it was full of grease and hugely over seasoned. I pushed the chicken aside focusing on the waffles and they weren't edible because all of the chicken grease drained onto them.  My daughter after waiting 20 minutes after everyone else had received their food ( they only have one working waffle iron)was so hungry she weathered through however the waiter returned and without any questions as to why my plate was still full, asked if I was finished. My husband and son both went for the country fried steak and eggs. The eggs looked delicious, the potatoes were just ok however, my son's steak was completely red in the middle and my husbands' was burnt. After flagging down the waiter he asked if he wanted another one. Needless to say we were all finished eating by the time the steak arrived, so it was a waste. The whole experience was terrible and I will never patronage them again.  I wish I had listened to my youngest and had just gone to McDonald's.",

Both were just overly sweet without the taste.  Reverse that please.  My mango coconut pancake was super spongy and as chewy as Octopus or Jellyfish.  No joke.  The eggs tasted powdery and were flash-cooked to the same chewiness as the pancake.  For two people with just two dishes and coffee the total was $60 and it was only worth $20.  Very over-hyped and they waaay under-delivered.  Also the management needs to do something to inspire your staff? They look miserable  it's so sad to see that, and unfortunately it translated into a dismal experience for us.  I hope this is well-received and changes made.  Again: higher-quality food (those can't be real eggs), less sugar, more care into the cooking process, and a focus on high-quality flavor and texture, and make it a fun place to work and the quality service will surely follow.",

We ordered chicken and (bacon) waffle tower, chorizo hash skillet, blueberry tractor driver combo and banana French toast.

The gravy is super creamy and there were some chunks of sausage here and there.  This dish was super big but then again all the dishes can feed 2 people or more.    Best place to go for a hangover.",

    "text": "So. Much. Food. So much yummy food.   Stayed at the Rio for a convention with my dad and sister, and since we opted out of a rental car we were limited to the restaurants on site, and this was our breakfast and lunch go-to for 3 days (would have been dinner spot as well had they been open).  My sister has some food allergies and when we told our 1st server, Steve, he was extremely helpful with suggestions. Thank you Steve! 5 star service for him.   Food itself is what you'd expect (only monster sized). Yummy, filling, hearty breakfasts, big burgers with all kinds of fixings, standard fries, and surprisingly good produce and salads.   My dad and I shared skillets with a side of meat or fruit depending on the day and it was just the right amount. Skillet comes with biscuit and two eggs (I don't eat eggs and he doesn't eat biscuits so it was perfect for us).   Sister had sides of chicken sausage, pork sausage, corned beef, ham (on separate days!) and shared the fruit bowls. All sides were yummy. I also like that the meat is plated on spinach so there's a bit of green to eat.   Burgers for lunch (or breakfast) were prepared to order and the cucumber dressing in the salad was great.   Fresh squeezed juices were great too.   Prices might seem a little much, but considering the portions  I think it's reasonable. Especially when you can't go anywhere else!",

HH is in lots of casinos so given it's primarily tourist customers, PLEASE stop wasting so much food!!  Ok, off my soapbox now ... The food ... It's good, but not THAT good.  We definitely did not like the Eggs Benedict ... Tomatoes in hollandaise?!  Iccck!!  And, expensive - with tip, $45 for 2 EBs and a Coffee (and, we only ate about 1/3 of it ...)",

    "text": "Good god the amount of food at Hash House is no joke.   We were on our way out of town and looking for a good brunch style meal to indulge in before heading on the drive back to LA. We stumbled upon Hash House on yelp and decided to give it a go. I am not sure why this location is rated lower than the other two in town, I risked it and went to Rio anyways.   This place is hidden away a bit and not super busy. We got a table right away, and the wait staff was very nice. Upon seeing the menu we all chose different things. This was a mistake, because even with four starving guys, we could have easily split two or three meals. Also the menu had some serious readability issues. I would argue that they really need to get that redesigned for increased readability.   I decided to go with the classic chicken and waffles. When this plate came out the potion was massive for less than $20. Two large pieces of fried chicken (mostly breast, but a little bone existed). 4 thick Belgium waffles. A smorgasbord of topping and plating arrangement to make it look sexy.   The syrup was light and really enjoyable. I loved cramming the chicken, waffle, and syrup combo into my mouth. Rather tasty. To my surprise the waffles were cooked with bacon in the middle. Now i don't know if that was on the menu or not, but it was a shock to me. A very pleasant and welcome shock.   My friends plates were equally as large and tasty. We all left feeling gorged.",

Everything was incredible. I don't really like mashed potatoes but THESE were so good I finished it all except for 1 waffle (1 waffle is like 4 regular sized waffle).

    "text": "I had three business breakfasts during the 2014 Marijuana Business Expo  at the at this horrid restaurant. Everybody told me this was an awesome breakfast, They can't even cook an egg.  First try, I tried the two egg breakfast and a fruit bowl. The scrambled eggs were from a caterers tray, the bacon was overcooked, the hash browns were burnt, and the fruit wasn't ripe.  Second breakfast, I ordered two scrambled ala carte and a side of bacon. I specifically asked for the eggs to be scrambled fresh. They brought me eggs from the caterers tray again. I ate the bacon; it was passable.  Third try, I order eggs over easy and a side of bacon. The eggs and the bacon was undercooked. I couldn't eat any of it.  This is a management and hiring problem. They need to fire the management first and see if the staff can be trained. If you can't cook eggs and bacon, your restaurant should not be serving breakfast.  This is a truly terrible restaurant. My clients paid them close to $80 dollars for my food and I got three passable pieces of bacon and six average cups of coffee. Stay away!",

I called in and asked if they took phone orders 10 minutes before closing time and the women said yes, I told her what I wanted multiple times and she said it wasn't on the menu or she couldn't hear me even though I had the menu right infront of me after three minutes she hung up or the phone disconnected because of terrible cell reception at the Rio. I called back immediately and the same woman picked up the phone and I told her that I wanted to order Togo she acknowledged that I was the guy who called in earlier but she told me that they don't actually do phone orders... 3 minutes prior she told me she could take my order. She said if I could make it on time I could order at the bar, but oviously I can't make it down from my room amd run all the way across the casino in under three minutes. She was just setting me up for failure. It's incredibly unprofessional customer service to tell me during one phone call that they do accept phone orders, but the next phone call just a few minutes later, the same employee says they don't. I don't understand why they would contradict themselves like that; it just gives this establishment a bad name, and now I know better than to try this location.",

They were quick in getting us our food so we were happy because we were also quite hungry. Our waitress was kind of rough around the edges. Not friendly and difficult to understand because she not only had an accent (nothing wrong with that, I have one too) but she also talked very fast. Nonetheless, she was prompt and checked on us several times. Now let's get to the food, I ordered the Tractor something lol I don't remember the exact name. It came with two eggs and then you had several options of what to finish the plate with. I got potatoes and french today. My fiance ordered the sage chicken and waffles. Both had a lot of food! Neither of us finished our food. The French toast was really good, it was topped with a banana cut in half, walnuts and syrup. The potatoes were good too, maybe a tad more salt. The eggs were very bland, definately in need of salt. My fiance liked the waffles and find out he wasn't a fan of sage. He did say if he liked sage, the food would have been great.",

I honestly tried to love this place but they fall way short of the original. Although service was great, the quality of the food can't be compared to the San Diego location. We came here twice in 2 days hoping that the first day was just a bad day. Both times our food came unexpectedly quick (within 5-7 min), and tasted pre cooked. The #5 stuffed burger was just okay. The hamburger meat was fast food quality and tasted bland. For $15, I expect good quality meat and great flavors. The day before I ordered the corned beef hash. Again, the food tasted like it was precooked and warmed to order. Highly disappointed. Way too much cheese (and I LOVE cheese). The breakfast biscuit was super hard. If you're looking for quantity with mediocre quality, this place is for you. The price of the plates and the overall quality of the food do not make sense in my book.",
