Only one unisex bathroom but that didn't effect the food at all. The gentlemen behind the counter appeared to be owners or what have you. They seemed to be enjoying their jobs and smiling even tho they were busy. That kinda charm I always tend to notice. Great little shop you have there!",

I can't begin to describe how fresh all the ingredients were!! We had a Italian Stromboli, the pepperoni had just the right spicy bite w/o the heartburn, onions were sweet to contrast the strong mozzarella that had the perfect cheesy taste, salami was deli fresh, crust was perfectly crunchy, neither soggy or burnt. Simply amazing!!! Please try!!",

    "text": "2nd Review  My boss was craving for some pizza and so I suggested she ate some Biaggio's Pizzeria.  Without hesitation, she gave me her card and ordered the $5.95 two slices of pizza and a drink.  Since I was flying, she said she was buying.  I couldn't wait to try out the pizza's since the last time I wasn't feeling well so I couldn't enjoy the food as much as I wanted to.  My boss also was craving for some garlic bread and ordered that as well.  Mr. Biaggio was really nice and remembered me from the last time I visited.  It's really impressive how he remembers his customers.  It's rare to find an establishment like this.  The last time I felt warm and fuzzy in a restaurant was in BFG Chicken Strips.  But that's a different review in itself.  I finally got my mouth around the pizza and mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm, I realize what my boyfriend meant when he said it tasted so good.  Also, what tasted even better was their garlic knots.  The heavenly taste was just \"To Die For!\"  Mr. Biaggio you definitely have the right words when you describe your heavenly creations.  After work I decided to treat my boyfriend to Biaggio's Pizzeria and he decided to get the meat lover's pizza while I chose the spaghetti with two meatballs.  The combination of the sauce with the meatballs with the spaghetti sauce tasted like an atom bomb.    I am definitely a fan and will order only their pizza from now on.  Thanks for an awesome heavenly pizza experience Mr. Biaggio.  :)",

I have loved on Vegas for 4 years and always saw this place as it is literally across the street from the entrance to my neighborhood but never tried it as I have Celiacs Disease. One day while family was in town everyone wanted pizza so we tried it out. To my suprize they had gluten free pizza and it was the best I have ever eaten. I have tried numerous gf pizzas in vehas to include Mark Rich's which was gross, BJs also gross and CPK ( they no longer make gf crust)  Biaggio and his business partner are the nicest people and genuinely care about the quality of the food served. If you go and don't like it they will make it right.   What are you waiting for? Go try it and tell them Brittany sent you!",

The only saving grace, and perhaps most important, the pizza was very good.  UPDATE: About 30 minutes after I posted this review I got a call from Biaggio's apologizing for my \"experience\" AND removing any and all charges. Even tho I said he should charge me for the GOOD pizza he said he wouldn't do that. Talk about making things right and then some! I had originally rated my experience 3 stars because of the overall experience. Based on the totally positive attitude Biaggo has displayed, not because of any refund, I'm upgrading my star rating. Yay, I am indeed a fan! Terrific response by a business.",

I think they add a little extra something to the dough (cinnamon??) that amp up the flavor, so it's no plain. The filling is great. Perfect dessert.

Gorgeous thin, foldable crust accompanied our delicious pepperoni pizza. Will return for sure! Biaggio was warm and friendly, wishing me a happy new year and assured me if I didn't like it, he would make it right. No need, it was perfect pizza for us Biaggio, thank you!",

From the moment I walked in the door and was greeted by the smell of pizza in the air to the moment I was thanked for stopping in, it was total 5 star treatment. The pizza was delicious. The right mix of the prefect crust, the right amount of some very tasty sauce, some really good tasting cheese and topped with the just the right amount of toppings, and baked up to a nice golden brown. If your looking for something a little out of the ordinary try the \"art of chicken\" pizza it's delicious. I have to say the service here was fantastic, got to meet the owner Biaggio and he's very gracious, friendly and definitely understands the meaning of good customer service. I'd have to say this place makes it into my top 5 favorite pizzeria's in the Vegas area. Almost forgot, if your looking for the tasty little sweet treat for after your pizza try the zeppoles, our group got an order and they disappeared just like that. I had to get a second order to bring home.",

    "text": "A friend of mine had his wedding reception here, and I was absolutely blown away.  Biaggio, the owner of the restaurant, personally catered the whole meal, and everything was perfect.  His wait staff was present but not overbearing, they didn't even flinch when a horde of seattlites requested coffees all around.  The best part was the food, though.  The salad that Biaggio made for us was a great combination of classic italian ingredients mixed with some of his own personal flair - The artichokes and dried tomatoes turned a good salad into a great one.  The stromboli was cooked to perfection, and the trio of meatball, pastrami, and chicken/artichoke covered the spectrum very well (though a veggie-only one might have been a good experiment as well).  The lasagna, though, completely blew my mind.  The sauce was rich and flavorful, the mozzarella was CLEARLY fresh, and the meatballs were spiced to perfection.  I would be a very large man if I had the chance to eat this every day.  The cannoli capped the evening out with a crisp, delicious shell and a cream that was surprisingly light.  Perfect way to end an evening.  The staff's energy was what truly gave this the last half star, though - Like I said before, Biaggio was engaging and informative during the whole dinner, and he really seems to pour his soul into the food he's making.  I should clarify - I'm not sure what the full extent of his daily menu is.  The food for the reception was obviously specially-ordered, but I don't know if you can expect it on a daily basis.",

They repeatedly talked about yelp, and gave us free appetizers and gave us large pizzas instead of the mediums we ordered.  The pizza was not very good.   The crust was tough, the sauce was bland, and the cheese was of a low quality.  The garlic knots were made from the same dough as the pizza and as a result were not very good.  The people working there were really friendly, but friendly does not equal good pizza.  They should spend less time working on their yelp reviews and more time working on their recipes.",

    "text": "What a great place! We found Biaggio's with the help of Siri (when we asked for best-rated pizza near us) and she suggested Biaggio's.  We didn't know what to expect when we pulled in since the parking lot and surrounding stores were empty, but when we walked in, there was a bustle in the air, laughter, and the sound of people having a good  time.  The man that greeted us with a smile and rose from the table to meet us ended up being Mr. Biaggio himself.  What a gracious host, I felt like I was in his home.  Our waitress was a delight, and we started our order with the garlic knots.. my boyfriend didn't like the last batch from Angelina's, so he was very skeptical.  The picture on the wall of the garlic knots got his attention and we ordered 2 orders (I love garlic bread!).. he ordered wings and then we got two separate pizzas, mine was the chicken with artichoke and olives.. I ordered with spinach instead of the chicken since I am a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate with a smile.  My BF ordered the Meat Lover's pizza and thought the meatballs were to die for.  The crust on our pizza was simple and delicious, bordering on flaky.. the color was even and cooked to perfection!  We even took pictures of our pizzas, they were so gorgeous.  And they tasted just as good!  Mr Biaggio sat with us for a while and was so very pleasant, even telling us some Italian cooking secrets (!).. (we love the carrot in the tomato sauce to reduce acidity) while he sat with us.  I got bad news by telephone while I was finishing dinner, and Mr. Biaggio even gave me a hug when I left.  How thoughtful and genuine.  What a dear man, I liked him very much.  There were lots of people who came and went for carry-out while we were there, so I know they are popular.. and they should be!!  Our experience was the BEST, and we will come back again and again!  Luckily for us, we live in the area, so we can get delivery!!!",

Both were good, a little salty (I think most food not made at home is salty - I rarely use salt), but well prepared otherwise. The garlic knots were soft and warm and had the perfect chewy consistency.  The chicken wings were crispy/crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The order was take-out, as we planned to have girls' night in. The order was easy to place, the food was exactly on time, and as soon as I entered I was greeted.  The place had several patrons who looked content.  I won't be ordering pizza (lactose - no thanks - they sprinkle the knots with a bit of cheese, but it is easy to pick off or ask them to leave it off), but the wings again - yes.",

For $9 could have gotten a caniac combo at Canes and also received fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, six meaty tenders and a drink.   This place is a disgrace!  If you can't make a calzone or even serve a tender that is thicker than a piece of paper you shouldn't call yourself a pizzeria.   Never again will I waste money on this craphole again.

Tonight we ordered - all from their specific Gluten Free Menu - gluten free chicken Parmesan, gluten free cheese ravioli, and a gluten free Caesar salad. Usually we get pizza.   Upon opening our food containers, the ravioli were not great but decent (and I hadn't had ravioli in years!) and the gf chicken Parmesan came with spaghetti. My boyfriend and I shared both items. After we were halfway through both dishes, we took the salad from the bag and saw that it had giant croutons on it. I even gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought those might be gluten free - until we called.   We were informed that they had messed up our order and the gf chicken Parmesan was supposed to come with gf ravioli; the spaghetti were never gluten free!! We were refunded but that doesn't make my stomach ache go away.   Please don't trust them if you have celiac. I'm really sick now just because they can't read and/or process orders right.  Never again, Biaggio. I hope the owner reads this so he can understand how serious celiac is. I work in food service, and if I served gluten containing food to someone with celiac I would be fired before I can say celiac! Very, VERY upsetting. Please don't come here. These people do NOT care about their customers.",

Being able to order and pay online is awesome, it's the little things in life. They came sooner than they said they would both times. You pay a little more than other places, but it's obvious you're getting what you paid for. The ingredients are SO fresh, not greasy, and the crust is the best.   They have officially found a new loyal customer!",

I've enjoyed some delish pizza in New York, and some crazy awesome cheesy pizza in Chicago (hello Giordano's), but NOTHING compares to the pizza I had tonight at Biaggio's. I ordered half and half of the Art of Chicken (artichokes, roasted tomatoes, olives and garlic) and the other half was the GEM: White Pizza which is mozzarella & ricotta cheese, olive oil, and garlic. Sure it sounds plain like you need a protein, but no. This is hands down the best BEST best pizza I have ever had. Although I enjoyed the Art of Chicken, I was kicking myself for not ordering a whole White Pizza. I'm a crust snob, and this crust was buttery and delicious. I seriously highly recommend!!",

We got buffalo chicken and meat lovers. Both were delish and they were not timid with toppings. The buffalo chicken pizza had a great buffalo sauce on it. The meat lovers has pastrami on it!   The wings were super crispy, but not overly greasy. They gave the medium sauce on the side, so that you could pour it yourself or use it as a dip. This is the 1st place I have been to that does that.  The garlic knots were good also. Lots of oil or butter at the bottom, but whatever makes it taste yummy, right?! Ha! I think these could have had more garlic on them, but we still ate them all.   I haven't tried the other stuff, so I'll be back!  I definitely recommend this place! I appreciate the hard work and pride people take in their restaurant and this spot shines!",

    "text": "This place was awesome!!! My boyfriend and I came here on date night, before heading out to a movie. We were in the mood for pizza, tired of little caesars (ugh) and wanting to try something new. We searched for pizza on yelp by rating and poof! This place popped right up.   When we arrived it was a packed house, the only tables available were outside and with it being a chilly vegas night, there wasn't a chance we were sitting out there. So we waited. Soon after we decided on and placed our order, a table opened up and the staff cleaned it and seated us promptly. They even brought over this cute little pot of flowers to put on our table that wasn't there before! Nice touch!  Since we had already ordered our food we didn't have to wait long before it came out to us. We got a medium sized meat lovers, 10 mild wings, and 2 garlic knots because we just wanted to try them. The wings were my favorite of the food we got. They were lightly breaded and baked so they slightly crunchy and yet so flavorful with the mild sauce. They also served them with ranch and extra mild sauce on the side which we used for more dipping. The pizza was delicious, with that fancy east coast sausage, though I was expecting something...different?...it was more... short, fat and fluffy then I expected I guess hahaha. The garlic knots were good, very fresh (aka very hot) but I thought they were missing a tiny bit of something I couldn't quite figure out.   The best thing I would say about this place which is the biggest part of what will definitely keep us coming back was the service. The staff was so incredibly friendly, it felt like a great place to come down with friends or family because that is how they would treat you! Plus, I've got to get me some more wings... oh and try that raved about meatball sub!",

Things I've tried: Garlic knots, meatball stromboli, chicken nuggets, and cheese pizza. All excellent. Garlic knots are very buttery and garlicky, just as they should be, the stromboli is massive and well made. I don't normally like meatball stromboli's, but the meat they use here is great, so I usually end up getting it. The pizza is your classic thinner crust, cheesy, kinda greasy east coast pizza.  Atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty casual. They've got a few booths and a flatscreen tv to watch the game on, I guess. Delivery is pretty swift, I think. I live about 20 minutes away, and my order always shows up in 45 minutes to an hour. Pretty fast for a place so far away.  Food holds up pretty well in delivery, since they use those thermal pizza bags.  Update: I actually have to tell myself, no Heather, you can't order a meatball stromboli today, it's that good. I get cravings for it! I've converted everyone in my house to Biaggios; when that stromboli arrives it's like a throwing bread at a flock of ducks. It's gone within minutes. Everybody likes the pizza too, but the stromboli's so damn good that we almost always end up getting that instead.",

Being that it's down the street from my gym (LVAC), the drive home is excruciatingly tempting. Alas, a sporadic treat every so often is a must. Anyways:  1. Pizza is flavorful, with a great crispy crust and a splendid balance of cheese and grease. Very east coast style.  2. The giant meatball is amazeballs. Yes, ONE meatball is what I ordered. According to Biaggio, they use a secret recipe with different meats and spices. Well, let me tell you... it's glorious.  3. Chicken wings are the best I've had in town. Somehow, they're juicy but not oily. They came out on a platter lined with paper, and the paper had no grease on it.   The first time I went there, they said they delivered anywhere in town, but I'm not sure they do that anymore - I'd never expect them to. As nice as the idea is, it's too much to ask of anyone.  So yeah, a huge lunch. Well worth the added caloric intake! Again, Biaggio is a funny man and he's got really great grub. Prices are comparable to other pizza joints.",

I was irritated by how uneven the slices were they cut it so lazy there were small and medium sized slices and two big ass slices double the size of all of them seriously cmon not cool when a family is eating it and now fighting over who gets the big pieces. Also I love ranch so of course I got their ranch which was a dollar and they give you the little standard size solo ketchup cup that wasn't even filled all the way on top of that the ranch was watered down and flavorless. I will say the staff was very friendly but at the end of the day dat I'm not paying for that I'm paying for the food probably won't be back",

Exactly how crust should be. Hot and perfectly crispy.  I don't think this particular pizza has sauce on it. Maybe olive oil? The lack of sauce made it very light. VERY LIGHT, almost bland. Got home, added some Parm and crushed red pepper and it was great! There wasn't much chicken on it which was a bummer considering the name.

He had the Jumbo Cheese Raviolis and I had the Eggplant Parmesan. Both were great, but we both agreed that the Eggplant was the best. It was perfectly cooked. Yes...once again, I forgot to take pictures.   The Eggplant comes with spaghetti. I usually avoid the extra carbs by skipping the spaghetti at most places. Not here. The sauce is amazing!!! So my husband shared the spaghetti until we were full. It was well worth the carbs. Bottom line...this place is a gem. We are coming back and can't wait to try the pizza!",

Typically, I order a pepperoni and black olive 'za and my wife's choice varies. This evening we ordered a Supreme to share and it was quite possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten!

Aside from excellent service, Biaggios offers really delicious food options. The pizza is fantastic with chewy crust with fresh toppings and high quality cheese that stretches when you take a bite or cut a slice away (I think that means the cheese is a blend of mozzarella and Munster cheese). The salad and garlic knots are bomb too.  Additionally my job requires me to cater in lunches to my customers and Biaggios more than assists in getting my food delivered hot and on time and at a really reasonable price.  I can't say enough good things! Give them a try!",

So the fiance and I headed over and ended up ordering some garlic knots and a medium supreme pizza.  The knots were soft with just the right amount of flavor.  The pizza... so good!  The toppings tend to slide around on the pizza, so you really have to get a hold of it to get a good bite with all of the fixings.  I usually like to dip my pizza in ranch, but this did not even require any!  Biaggio himself came over and greeted us, which I thought was a nice touch.    I will return soon to try some more of this delicious pizza and maybe one of the tasty sounding desserts on the menu!",

    "text": "It hurts to write this update.  Biaggio and his staff are super friendly and will bend over backwards to get things right.  Maybe this just wasn't their night last week.  But it still shows how far they'll go for customer satisfaction.     7:45pm: We feel like a pizza.  Just moved closer to Biaggio and the last 2 experiences we had there were good so what the heck.  I order a large supreme with extra cheese.  The lady over the phone tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.    8:10pm: I arrive and the cook informs the cashier he hasn't even started my order yet.  She seems shocked.  There was some grumbling back there with Biaggio and the staff.  Biaggio come up to me and apologizes profusely for the mishap, gives me my $23 back and said he would take care of me the next time as well.  I didn't think it was that big a deal and did not make a stink over it at all.  I said it would not be necessary to take care of me on the next trip and tipped $3 to the staff.  The pizza comes out unusually fast and I go home.  8:27 and 24 seconds:  Arrive home and bring the pizza to the dining table and my wife takes the first bite.  The green peppers are COLD.  The pizza is not even warm and the consistency of the cheese is weird.  It was as if the cook took a cheese pizza that had been sitting out for a while and attempted to reheat it with the toppings he just added.  I thought I could just ignore all this and eat it but after half a slice, I called the restaurant and explained the situation.  The cashier offers to deliver a hot one to my house at no additional cost.  Fine!  Why would the cook think he could get away with giving me that first pizza?  Did he just think we wouldn't notice?  It was kind of offensive.  I've never returned a pizza ever before!  I couldn't believe it.   9:03: New hot pizza arrives and it's definitely oozing with cheese.  It doesn't have as much pepperoni or sausage but still way better than the first one.  The thing was that this new pizza was NOT five stars.  Not even close.  I could rattle off 5 other places off the top of my head that were better than this.           But the service, effort and attempt to do right is what saves it from giving them 2 stars.  I honestly believe this could've been just a bad night but I hadn't eaten there in over a year and won't give it five stars if it doesn't deserve it and tonight it certainly did not.  I am coming back for wings and pastrami but on the border for pizza.",

    "text": "Molto Bene!  First my disclaimer.  Lost my good phone about 8 months ago and not able to upgrade for too long.  My non-contract phone was a POS and thus terminating my mobile social media habit.  So, I have not been doing my due-deligence as a proud Yelper.  Did the Pumpkinman triathlon a few weeks back and it wooped on my pretty bad.  I got home beat tired (I live off of Rochelle and Ft. Apache).  I was really craving spagethi of all things.  I rarely  venture east of Ft. Apache and I just could not think of a place to eat but was starved.    DUH.  Yelp it.  I was using PASTA as the keyword and Biaggio's does not come up in the top three I think because his specialty is pizza.  I saw some things down on Rainbow but I really did not want to drive that far.  I saw this Ft. Apache address and I was mystified by the map.  How in the hell could this be across the street from me (walking distance if I wasn't so tired)?  As I was pulling into the parking lot, I noticed some people leaving with bikes on their racks and it was easy to surmise they had probably just finished Pumpkinman which was a good sign.  I walked in and the way the place is laid out you are not quite sure if you are supposed to be seated or go up to the counter.  (both options are acceptable)  I walked up to the counter to minimize the meet and greet steps and ordered some spaghetti.  Biaggio was like, \"ok, how about some meatballs?\"  I was like ok, whatever but I really just wanted the pasta.  Biaggio then says \" I am going to just give you a piece of pizza...what kind do you want?\"  Pepperoni and sausage would be great.  I sat down in a booth and looked at the great images of his pizzas and realized he is all about his pizzas.  I was served quick enough considering this is not microwave chow, and the presentation was beautiful.  (see my pix).  The one slice was almost enough but then the spaghetti came and I was golden.  But, hold on....Yes, the meatballs were incredible.  By the time I gorged myself, did a yelp and Facebook checkin, sent my photos to all my friends, had a nice little chat with Biaggio.  He is one cool kat.  Can hardly wait to return to the scene of my crime (by not eating here in the last 4 years I have lived across the street from the restaurant).  I would high recommend and also chat it up with everyone there.  Friendly peeps.",

The first time my husband and I came in, I had mentioned that I wanted to try the pasta and he gave us two free meatballs with sauce and baguette with our slices of pizza. This made me come back for a second time because the meat balls were quite delicious (and I am usually not a big meat ball fan) so we tried the meat ball sub with ziti. The food tasted fresh and was not at all too salty which is a huge bonus! The only negative thing I would have to say was that the fries were a bit small for 3.50.",

    "text": "My husband and I were looking for a place to grab a bite after playing volleyball at Gardens Park and found Biaggio's on Yelp.  Having moved here from NYC, we've had all kinds of great pizza and are pretty picky with what we find in Vegas.  We started out with some fantastic garlic knots.  They were perfectly seasoned on a pool of olive oil and also came with some tasty marinara sauce.  Take your pick on which to dip them in!  I did both!  We had a medium-sized (6 slices) \"Art of Chicken,\" which had chicken, artichokes, roasted tomatoes, garlic, and black olives.  Delicious!  The pizza dough tasted great.  I love artichokes and roasted tomatoes and these were as fresh as you can get.  It's great having a slice of pizza with quality ingredients.  We got to speak to the owner while we dined at one of the outside tables and you are immediately aware of the passion he has about his food.  I love to cook so can appreciate that.  Service was really generous and nice, too.  We'll be back next time we're in the neighborhood to explore the other specialty pizzas on the menu.  This place doesn't take pizza for granted.  5 stars for quality ingredients and quality service.",

Also I come to learn they deliver throughout the valley of las Vegas.  A a few notables are the chicken wings and meatballs. They are to die for.

The onion rings were soggy and gross. I kinda figured they would be from that long drive to my place, so I blame myself for that choice. The pizza was very underwhelming. I was so disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. The crust was blah, the toppings were blah, the only saving grace was the flavorful tomato sauce. The highlight of the meal were the chicken wings. They were really good. Great texture and flavor. The bleu cheese dressing that came with them wasn't great, but we just ended up dipping them in the hot sauce instead and yum.   Overall, not the greatest place, but it'll do in a pinch.",

One Pizza is good for three super hungry people, or maybe two and half. - we could not finish the first one, the second one is dinner   If you are around this area, you must try their pizza, its a treat and the service is very courteous  and polite.

    "text": "Biaggio joins Bo from Yi Mei Champion Deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet. People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.  It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.  When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.  Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.  With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.  It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).  5 stars",

    "text": "My husband works near here so I yelped to find a pizza place we could try on his lunch break.  My search led me to Biaggio's and I'm thrilled that it did!    The restaurant is not big but it has a nice, inviting feel to it.  Big booths and comfortable seating.  The display case showcases pizza pies, specialty slices, drinks, and their Boar's Head products (hubby's favorite).    It was the owner, Biaggio himself, who greeted us with a smile and a, \"thanks for stopping in.\"  This was just our first taste of the excellent service we received.    We chose a booth and received drinks immediately.  My husband was between a meatball hero and the Secret BLT that he had seen on the website.  He ultimately went with the BLT, we ordered garlic knots, and a small cheese pie.    It took a little while for our food to arrive, but worth the short wait!  The garlic knots were perfectly soft with a crisp and the marinara sauce was delicious.  My husband LOVED his BLT.  The pizza was very satisfying... and you all know by now that I'm a NY'er and my pizza standards are high.  I'm also not losing my touch for recognizing a good slice.  The crust was fantastic - it was crispy and crunchy but foldable and, to some NY'ers, if you can't comfortably fold it it's a total deal breaker.  Oh!  And I almost forgot to mention the zeppoles.  Now, they're not as light and fluffy as I remember them back at my stomping grounds.   But they are deliciously smothered in powdered sugar and served with a raspberry dipping sauce as well as a vanilla(?) sauce that creates a delightfully sweet raspberries and cream dip.  Biaggio took the time to tell us the best way to dip (first in the raspberry and then in the creamy vanilla dip) and this combo was delectable.  My husband preferred to eat them without the dip but he's not a \"sweets\" person.    I can't speak on the taste of this, but I noticed that they offer gluten free options, and I know this is often hard to come by.    The owner came by to check on us a couple of times with a very delightful and friendly demeanor.  I felt like an old friend of the restaurant, not a first-time customer.  My husband told the owner that he was initially between the BLT and the meatball hero, which he had surmised was the best around based solely on yelp reviews.  My husband mentioned that he hadn't found a fully satisfying meatball hero since moving here and was looking forward to trying it next time.  Moments later Biaggio returned with a plate in hand and gave my husband a Biaggio's meatball to try.  What a nice gesture and we were so excited to try it.  It was incredible, and I'm not even a meatball person.    Delivery in the valley is tricky.  Not everyone does it and, when they do, you're not sure where they'll deliver to.  Biaggio's delivers ALL OVER the valley.  Want to try it but live in Henderson??  Go for it.  They promise your food will be deliciously hot and fresh when it arrives.    Can't wait to return to you, Biaggio's!  Thank you for the kind and hospitable service and delicious eats.",

    "text": "I hate to go against the grain, but as a True pizza connoisseur, it would be wrong to hold back on this one. For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here.   I do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having \"burnt\" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a True NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah.   I thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place.   In fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!). This pizza may be appealing to some, but this isn't anything like the pizza served in NY.",

    "text": "Good pizza joint. I enjoyed the pizza dough quite a bit.   Their mix is good.   Ordered a half and half and it was delish. I'd only ask for well-done next time so it can support the artichoke and mushrooms better without the dough getting soft.   If you've never had ricotta and fresh basil to your favorite pizza before, try it!  You'll thank me later.   Also, there is a reason why their zeppolis are priced a bit higher than other joints in town.   Let's just say that no one except for Biaggio's makes Zeppolis with the love, technique, quality kneaded dough...there is a science to making them and following the proper timing of when ingredients are added, how long dough is kneaded and tossed, baked / and fried.   Add patience as a +1. Biaggio's treats every food order like it's made for Mama!  They never slack off or cut corners.    I'm a customer of 5 years...not gonna BS anyone on Yelp.  I'm telling folks out there debating between here and another joint to try Biaggio's...anything on the menu.  Ask for special requests if you call.  They may have certain ingredients or veggies or meats if you don't see them on the menu.   Nice and friendly respectable staff.  The owner has personally delivered to my house on several occasions.  Nothing special about my order.  It reflects the love and passion he invested in his business though.   Looking for a properly reliable and delicious Italian spot intended to remind you what Italian should taste like?  Biaggio's!     Again, I will reiterate about the Zeppolis.  They are plentiful, puffy with a slight crisp.  The dough is so well made that even after two days in the container. They were still so soft and had just the right amount of sweetness!!   I don't know donuts that even hold up that well. And Zeppolis should never taste like donuts people.   Hands down, Biaggio's ties Nico's as the best Italian restaurants in town.  Both make their sauces in house.  Also, Biaggio's offers a dine-in area to chill and have a slice  I enjoy eating it in the restaurant.  Very familial.  Take care everyone.    Devin T.   Signing-off.   Stop scrolling down.",

But as we were waiting for our rolled ice cream that she had to try, I called in a pick up order from this place.  They were just around the corner.  The timing worked out well with standing in line for rolled ice cream.   Browsing menu conveniently available on Yelp; I didn't want just pizza again.  They have Stromboli!  What is that?!  I had no idea but I did the crazy and ordered something I've never tried nor seen!  Trusting the Yelp rating and glad they were close by.  Arrived for pick up and told Ness just show them my Yelp Eat 24 receipt on my cell.  She's like, \"WHAT DIDJA ORDERRRR?!\"  Hahhaaaa I told her I didn't know and asked why.  Laughing she showed me the box.  We were all daaaaaang!  So its like a pizza sandwich in a sealed off bun.  Comes with a marinara sauce which was too dinky for the meal portion.  We need a can full of marinara for the large stromboli!  Hahahaa.  It was a super delicious surprise.  Yeah I actually ate half of it - almost overdosed.  The filling is really tasty.  What I liked best is it was somewhat easier to eat than a pizza slice while on the road.  Great find on Yelp!",

It is rather a heavy side and the dough is a bit greasy. Overall pizza tasted great and I personally liked the chicken artichoke pizza. I also ordered medium chicken wings, and it was not your typical chicken wing with sauce all over on it...

I love pizza and based on the many five star reviews ordered the art of chicken and a pepperoni pineapple. The four of us all agreed it was some of the worst pizza we have ever had. The crust was like frozen take home, the toppings were sparse. We are just visiting here so depending on Yelp reviews for our choices. I would suggest going somewhere else for a good pizza.",

My wife and I shared the White pizza (no racial, that's what it was called) which included mozzarella and ricotta cheese, olive oil, garlic, and we also added pepperoni to it. It was a simple yet tasty pizza, and the ricotta gave it a nice touch.   Also got an order of their wings, and its sauce came on the side which I prefer anyways. The wings were hot and crispy to the touch, and the buffalo sauce was fantastic!  We dined in, and the service was outstanding. We'll definitely be back, especially for those garlic knots!",

We were surprised to see the place was empty when we came in (but then again, we went on a Sunday night) but we were excited to try this place because of the good reviews on yelp. We tried the large meat lovers pizza ($21.99), garlic knots ($5.99), and fried mushrooms ($5.99) and were not disappointed at all! I didn't get out server's name but he was so kind and welcoming. It was a little of a wait for the food to come out but everything was served hot, delicious, and fresh. Highly recommend if you're in the area! We will definitely be back.",

After reading all the hype on Yelp for Biaggio, I was excited and intrigued.  Could there really be a good pizza place so close to my house?  Game on the hubby and I said, we want some good homemade pizza.  We ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza and it sucked.  Two thumbs down, just sucked.  The crust tasted liked Red Rock pizza crust.  The cheese and sauce is nothing special.  Nope, not coming back.  We didn't even eat the leftovers.  hence, the hubby and I will continue to whore ourselves out to Grimaldi or Settebello.  -M2",

The dough was very nice and all the ingredients were top notch!  My son even told us that he prefered the baked macaroni here then the one at home!

First, we noticed a very friendly and knowledgeable server (who turned out to be the owner- Biaggio). He told us about the quality of the ingredients and how the secrets of the preparation were handed down from family... The hype was so much :) Happily, the pizza was as good as the hype! It's the freshest, tastiest, and best pizza we've ever had. We can never go back to Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Woodfired Pizza. When it is hot and fresh, it is absolutely delicious. You can tell the quality of the ingredients! We had the Supreme Pizza(yummy)... also tried the Garlic Knots (amazing!!!) and finished it off with his addicting signature dessert (Zeppole)... Can't wait to have it again :)",

I am typically not a fan.  But these are welcome to my dinner anytime!  They had bite to them without being rubbery and they were buttery and parmesean-y and, just plain ol' good!  They deliver anywhere in the valley which is a treat cause we live on the opposite side of town and it would be a bummer if we only got to partake on haircut days (salon is across the street). The best part?  the food actually came out looking like it did in the pictures!  Very much looking forward to our next experience with the owner, the staff and, oh yea, the food!",

    "text": "Had a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and a few slices of pepperoni from this place.   Philly Cheesesteak was the best I've ever had.  I'm not kidding.  Even better than the one from Philly.  They caramelize the onions and mushrooms perfectly.  The meat was flavorful and still juicy (hard to do when it's chopped so fine).  The cheese was great and had a nice tang.   Bread could have been crispier on the outside but that's a personal preference.  Have to say...I'm craving one right now. Pepperoni slices were nice too.  This place cooks until the cheese is just melted.  I can see how other people have had underdone pizzas since they don't blast their pies, but mine was perfect.  The crust was a little crispy and chewy.  I'd say the crust at Metro Pizza is still way better.  But that's an almost perfect crust unless you compare that to the really high end pizza places like Mozza in LA.  The pepperoni tasted just like a nice pepperoni you'd get at the store.  Weirdly, the best pepperoni IMO is at Round Table.   Very disappointed they are not open on Sunday.  Either they're religious or they really like their football.  I can't believe the amount of business they're turning away on a Sunday.  But everyone needs a vacation I guess. Highly recommended.  Just don't go on a Sunday!  Their delivery is fast and reliable.",

I have eaten at Biaggio's several times now i try to go once a week and sometime twice a week, with the whole family and sometimes just hubby and I or with friends for lunch and let me say no matter when i go the food is always GREAT!!!!! The Owner Biaggio is always there to greet you and make you feel welcomed, the young staff he has working for him are polite and hard workers. I have tried the pizza with just cheese or with pepporoni and sausage to the ham and pineapple and it has all been excellent GREAT flavor NOT GREASY (Blair obviously does not know what she is talking about) Very TASTEFUL and never bland tasteing, I love it!!!! The Fried zuchinni is awsome, with ranch or marinara the garlic knott yummy always have to order those too. My hubby had an Antipasto Salad yesterday for lunch and it was amazeing it was huge and the italian dressing is yummy!!!! The chicken parmagean sandwich is great too, there has never been anything there i ordered that i was not extremely happy with. The first time i ever went there biaggio brought us out some meatballs and told us we had to try them the where \"To die For\" and let me tell you he wasn't lieing they are extremely tasty. Also Biaggio is extremely kind and generous When my kids where playing football he brought out to the field 6 pizzas 3 pep and 3 cheese and donated them to my sons team free of charge clear out at centenial high school and they were delivered still HOT the team totally appreciated it!!!!  So if you want great tasting food Biaggio's is the place to go!!!!! Will continue to support him and his business.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give Biaggio a good review but unfortunately, they did not pull through on our large delivery order. I placed this order weeks in advance and come the day of my party the delivery was disorganized.   First off, I was promised that for the price paid, I would receive enough food to feed my party. Plus, I was told that our delivery would be on time. He was 15 minutes late and we had to walk down to meet him near the parking garage to carry all of the food and drinks up to our hotel. By the time we ate our food, the pizza was dry and luke warm. What was the purpose of the delivery fee?   Second, our order incorrect. The salad that he told us would feed enough people ...well...didn't. He said he would send garlic knots...he didn't. They didn't send enough soda liters...and for a group of 13 people, we got 6 forks. This was such a huge disappointment because Biaggo had promised an amazing dining experience.   To make up for it, they offered to send us all of the missing items AND free dessert. THEY NEVER CAME!   My fellow yelpers may say that their pizzeria is good, but I would avoid delivery, especially to the strip and on a big order. It just seems like too much for them to handle.",

    "text": "Better than Metro, and 1/2 the $!  Okay so I just moved to this area a few weeks ago, so I checked yelp to see where the good places to eat around here are. Saw the reviews, had to find out for myself.  I've been disappointed in the \"quality\" of good pizza places in Vegas since I moved here 4 years ago. Every place either had bad pizza, or was just too expensive. Biaggio's finally broke that trend. Great pizza, awesome ingredients, and Biaggio himself came over to my table to make sure that everything turned out okay. I got to tell him that I worked at a church, so he told me that if I brought the kids by he would hook us up with a deal. That always means a lot to me when someone runs a great business, and cares about the community!  Only downfall to the place is that it's the chick fil a of pizza places. (not open on Sunday) Also I would probably never go there to watch any sporting event, because of the lack of viewable T.V.'s  Anyway I give it 5 stars. I base that on: quality of the pizza, service/owner, and the garlic knots (you're not getting the whole experience if you don't get them)",

I would prefer a little More sauce on the pizza and perhaps romaine lettuce instead of iceberg, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is great. I can't even explain how well we were treated. Check them out when you have a chance~",

I was craving pizza one night, and I haven't lived in this side of town for very long. Yelpers seem to love this place, so I tried it out. The pizza was hot and fresh and really fantastic. Just as I like it...not too thick or thin, the perfect amount of sauce, and quality toppings. However, there is only one size, so if you're eating alone and don't want to/can't eat it all yourself, it's a waste. It is also really expensive for a meal for one. If it had been earlier in the evening, I probably would have left without ordering anything, but I was hungry and it was a work night, so I forked out the big bucks and took the leftovers (3/4 pizza) to a friend the next day. Would I go back? Not if I were alone. With friends, maybe.",

Everyone loved the pizza, only issue was I asked the pizza to be square cut as there were 20+ people coming and with the normal slices it made it difficult for everyone to share and try the 6 different pizza flavors we ordered. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place and will order again for a night in with the hubby.",

This is definitely the go to spot for us now. Came here two days in a row just to order the chicken wings.  The chicken wings are absolutely my favorite out of the pizza and garlic knots we ate. However, those were delicious, too!  We ended up ordering their lunch special which consists of a drink and two pizza slices of your choice.  We expected the slices to be small, so we each ordered our own special. The pizzas are freaking huge and we could've honestly shared, but at least I brought home leftovers ;P I ordered a slice of the Art of Chicken, my husband ordered a slice of BBQ chicken, and our second slice we both ordered was White Pizza.  I actually tried his BBQ chicken and it was tasty! The BBQ is sweet and I love sweet :P  I ordered the Art of Chicken without olives and it was delicious. I think the roasted tomatoes is what topped it off in deliciousness!  And I love how every slice of their pizza was crunchy. It's thin crusted pizza with crunch. Just the way I love it.  Order the garlic knots, to try. If you love garlic, DO IT. Yummy and fluffy :P Thank you for your service, it was delicious and at a great price of only $30! 2 lunch specials, garlic knots, and 6 wings.",

So I didn't refrain from ordering both.  A fine side salad with Italian Dressing got things off to a nice start.  This was then followed by a large portion of Spaghetti & Meatballs, seasoned with onions, and well executed with fine saucy flavoring.  And, the Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza with Grande Cheese that immediately followed was suitably saucy and cheesy, and adorned with all fresh and tasty toppings.  Moreover, the perfectly cooked pizza crust was of the thin variety while still allowing for chomping toothsome bites, and individual slices were nice and springy when hand held.  It was a very satisfying dinner, as well as a reheated pizza lunch at home the next day!",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place because of the wonderful reviews I read about it online, and I sure am glad that I did!  My dining companion and I had a hotel on the strip, so we had to drive out a bit to get to this wonderful little pizza shop, but it was well worth it.  As a side note, they do deliver to the strip if that's something that interests you.  It's an $8.00 charge and can take up to an hour to get it to you according to their website.  But if you're looking to get off the strip for a while, it's about a 20-25 minute drive from the strip depending on traffic, but it's also super easy to find even if you don't know the area.  My first impression when I walked into this pizzeria was that it was clean, uncluttered, and that the smell was mouthwateringly amazing.  We were acknowledged right away by the server, even though she was busy.  We were seated very quickly after that.    We ordered the garlic knots to start out with and I must say that they were just as delicious as I'd read they were, though they aren't quite as good the next day, so eat them when they're fresh.  For the pizza we ordered a small \"Supreme\" and a small \"Art of Chicken\".   The menu says that small pizzas are 10\" with four slices each, but the pizzas we received seemed bigger than that and had more slices than four.  When the check came we looked to see if we'd gotten mediums, but sure enough it had two small pizzas there.  This isn't a complaint; more of an observation.    The pizza was very delicious.  It had a good amount of olive oil (so did the garlic knots), and I think for some people that could put them off, but I thought it was perfect.  The crust was browned nicely and had a slight crisp to the outside, but the inside was nice and chewy.  Both pizzas were fantastic and my only regret is that I couldn't eat more in one sitting or fit in dessert!  Our server was very friendly and service oriented.  She was also very observant and seemed to be very aware of what was going on in the pizzeria.  She boxed the pizza left overs at the table (the pizza makes great leftovers) and made sure we had everything we needed before we left.  We also were happy to meet Biaggio.  He was very friendly and it was obvious to me that he takes great pride in his business and what comes out of his kitchen.  To sum up this review, I would love to get pizza from here again the next time I'm in the area.  Everything was awesome.  The only bad thing I have to say is that I live so far away!  I would definitely order from this pizzeria regularly if it was in my area.",

They also have delicious tiramisu although a little on the sweet side (that's usually how it is with premade Ladyfingers but I've no idea of their preparation methodology) Good cheesecake as well.",

Biaggio himself is such a wonderful host that he makes you feel like family rather than a customer. Also, they deliver ALL over town, yes ALL over!

I went back today with my wife and son and we were treated to the BEST pizza, wings, and garlic knots we have had in Las Vegas!!!  Not only was the food incredible but the customer service provided by Biaggio and his staff was second to none!  He made us feel at home and was so passionate in describing to us the way he prepares his fresh food.  It is truly a one-of-a-kind establishment and worth trying... you will not regret your experience!!    We have now found our #1 pizza place in Las Vegas... Thank you Biaggio!!!",

Mr. Biaggio greeted me like a long lost friend and made me feel comfortable right away.  I ordered a large pepperoni pie to bring home. As soon as I got it out into my car, I couldn't resist taking a bite. WOW!!!! Such great flavor!  I am originally from the east coast and am quite familiar with really good pizza. Let me tell you, Biaggio's is THAT pizza the east coast people have been looking for in Vegas!!  He creates a delicious fold able crust and his sauce has the perfect amount of seasoning. He told me the ingredients he uses, bursting with pride as he described his methods to create his perfect pies.  Mr. Biaggio himself LOVES to give hugs. He is such a sweet, handsome man. I really like how he makes me feel appreciated every time I enter his establishment.  Today he surprised my husband and I with a complimentary order of wings. His wings are to die for! Great, crispy coating on the skin, juicy (not greasy) chicken and good amount of meat! Not just a little one biter either!  Biaggio's Pizza is a gem among pizza places in Vegas. I am so glad to have found him!   We have pizza at least once a week, sometimes we have him deliver to us, sometimes we go to him, for the food AND the conversation Mr. Biaggio provides.  He will also deliver ANYWHERE in town! Thankfully, I am just a stone's throw away!",

BUT, I have used the delivery service only twice, and BOTH times they messed up my simple order, the second time sending a regular, non-gluten free pizza, which of course I could not eat. I live an hour away, so waiting for another wasn't practical. I decided to give them another chance tonight, but I wanted to speak with Biaggio personally first and let him know about the mistakes on the deliveries and help make sure it didn't happen again. I told him I would be upset if it happened again, and jokingly said I would post a bad review on Yelp if they messed it up. Instead of apologizing, he defended the restaurant saying, \"It's just a pizza and people make mistakes. I'm going to decline your order and wish you on your way.\" Ironically, he was upset that I didn't call and speak to him about the mistakes(at the time), but this is actually what I was just doing and he refused to let us eat there anymore as punishment. Turns out the service isn't that great after all! Fortunately there's no shortage of restaurants in Las Vegas.",

Another friend had the caesar salad with grilled chicken and TESTIFIED to the awesomeness of it. The dressing was freshly made in the back according to Biaggio himself.  Speaking of, the service here is incredible. Everyone is friendly and helpful. We ordered a medium pizza and they ended up giving us a large because they didn't have any dough prepared for a medium at the moment. Biaggio came and talked to us for a few minutes.  I'm definitely going to be coming back here to try their other menu selections. I think next up is the calzone.",

The Pizza may have been even worse though, I like some grease on my Pizza, key word some...this pizza was drenched in it, making the Pizza very soggy. The cheese taste was pretty good and I can't complain about the Pepperoni, but the crust was totally uninspiring, very tasteless.

We have a typical order of garlic knots and cheese pizza.  Oh, and you can't forget the Ranch! :)  And, these are the things we rate the place on...lol!  This Friday, we found Biaggios...it was AWESOME!  The owner was there front and center to greet us.  We quickly put in our drink orders and garlic knots.  The owner overheard our server and thought that was all we were ordering, so he told the server to get us 2 slices for us to try.  We quickly said we were ordering a whole pizza, so they got that going for us.  The garlic knots came out and were SO fresh(definitely not sitting in a warmer!)  These were AMAZING...the BEST we'd ever had.  It must have been the butter that they were sitting in that made them mouth-watering!  Next came the pizza.  Again...GREAT!  We got 1/2 cheese 1/2 meat lovers.  My husband could not stop raving about the sliced meatballs, which we were told were an old family recipe.  The crust was perfect---not too thick, not to thin---but perfectly foldable! ;)    We thought we were done when the owner brought us out a sample of their 'Fried Dough' dessert.  These were sinful...covered in powdered sugar w/white chocolate, raspberry and fudge dipping sauces.  DELISH!  While the food was great, the customer service matched it.  The owner and few servers constantly made sure we had what we needed!  We found our pizza match!",

My wife and I live in Henderson and we were going to a church meeting in Summerlin. Instead of picking up the pizza's at our typical Henderson pizzerias, we decided to try a place closer to where the meeting was. I got on yelp and found Biaggio's. My wife placed the order online. Our meeting was at 6:30 and we got to Biaggio's at about 6:15.  It turns out they had the order wrong. They only made one pizza and it was the wrong pizza.  We ordered two.  We decided to wait for them to make the two we ordered. We sat down and Biaggio came to the table and immediately offered us drinks on the house. I said no thanks, we are in a hurry.  He then brought out an envelope with a $30 gift card.  We were shocked, this went above and beyond in customer service. A few minutes later, the pizzas we ordered were ready. We went to pay, and he wouldn't let us.  Everything was on the house. Not only did he give us the two pizzas we ordered for free, but also the pizza they mistakingly made, with wings and garlic knots. We couldn't believe it. we have never had better customer service. When we got there we were really annoyed, when we left, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.  By the way, the food was outstanding. Pizza was great and the garlic knots are out of this world.  Biaggio's is what all restaurants should be - great food and great customer service. We will be back.",

    "text": "This is my very first interview on YELP.. so I am not sure it will stay on the page.. or go to a filter.   Biaggio's Pizzeria on Flamingo/Fort Apache was right next to a salon that I worked in, and this pizzeria is fantastic. I think it's a \"little known secret\" that no one knows about yet. Even though the owner (Biaggio) has an extensive menu, I always opted to order one of my favorites: \"the Art of Chicken\". Which is a homemade pizza topped with chicken (of course) (and lots of it), fresh artichokes, amazing roasted tomatoes (that I think makes the pizza so mouth watering), garlic and black olives. My habit of ordering was to get a slice of the Art of Chicken (which is crispy on the bottom; not too think and definitely not thin) and loaded with all of the ingredients above. (With a side of Marinara sauce). Biaggio's chefs are very ample on the portions... and I used to always order that traditional orange soda in a bottle called .. hmmm.. I cannot quite remember.   Oh yes, when I first met Biaggio he told me that his wings were the \"best\". At the time, I did not believe him. I thought he was using a \"sales pitch\" on me. So I declined buying any. Well.. because I worked right next to his building, a few feet in my beauty salon next to his restaurant.. he sent over one of his chefs (a few minutes later).. with a full order of deep fried wings... complimentary just for me to try. YOU HAVE TO EAT THEM HOT and right when they are made. He was right!!! These were the best wings I have ever tasted. The skin and the batter was super crunchy and had an amazing taste. The chicken wings and legs themselves.. melted in my mouth.. literally. Not sure if I had chicken that ever did just that. But I only order them when I know I don't have to share. Biaggio simply is the BEST out there.. just like you are in NYC. (Love you Biaggio) (from your favorite flower Rose).",

I loaded up my GF pizza with toppings and I SERIOUSLY COULD NOT STOP EATING IT!! Soooooooo good! I asked if I could have my pizza cooked a bit longer so the crust would be crunchy and the owner's employee asked if it it was  dark enough & if I wanted it cooked longer - how nice! I had it cooked just a bit longer because I had ordered juicy pineapple (and pepperoni & onions & green peppers & ricotta cheese - I told you I made a loaded pizza!!!). I planned on only eating 1/2 and I ate all but a slice and 1/2! What a treat to eat gluten free pizza on vacation!",

Tonight after an exhausting day I got a pizza delivered and when I opened the box after brining it inside I tried pulling the slices apart and the cheese had slid together. Could easily have happened at any point and I understand things happen. I called and let them know and Biaggio's said to eat what we could and he would have another sent over. Not only did a fresh pizza arrive but also a gift certificate. Amazing customer service. I was not expecting to get a gift certificate. Great people and great food.",

The slices wouldn't even hold up as you tried to separate a piece from the rest. It was awful. And for $95!!!! I'd have rather eaten nuts from the mini bar. At least they would've been cooked. What a total disappointment. If you're wanting pizza delivery to save some money in LV avoid this place. It's overpriced and bad pizza. You're better off ordering dominos.",

I love the chunks of sausage oh so much and the chunks on our pizza were yum yum yummy and juicy. The sauce was really tasty as well. Savory and slightly sweet. Not too much or too little, the perfect Little Red Riding Hood amount; just right! Good quality cheese blend in just the right amount as well. The pepperoni was spot on as well; leaving just enough orange grease to let you know it's there but not so much it was dripping all over the place.  Bottom-line; not the best pizza I have had in Vegas, that still belongs too Old School, but certainly the second best, with the added bonus that Biaggio\"s is 5 minutes from my house and not 45 like Old School.  The antipasto salad was great! Huge! Yummy! Loaded with everything you would want in an antipasto and one thing you wouldn't expect: dill pickle slices. Huh? But when all was said and done, they fit right in.   Only one thing that I would mention on the negative side is that the pick-up order that was supposed to take \"20 minutes\" took 45. I placed my order on-line, which was easy enough.  Thanks Biaggio's, and thank Yelpers for this place!",

I'm not from New York, I'm not from Chicago, but I Love Pizza and I consider myself a connoisseur. Although I'll try any style and any toppings my favorite style is the Flat, and not the thin crispy kind either. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area there was one place that always brings me home and Biaggio's is one of the only three places in Vegas that gives me a taste of the style of Pizza I Loved growing up with.  We tried a Large Pepperoni, Mushroom Sausage and it was Delicious! So delicious my wife and I ate the entire thing, that's how good it was. We ordered Buttered Pasta for our 3 year old and she Loved it too.  But that wasn't the Best part of our Dining Experience, Mr. Biaggio himself came to every table and greeted himself and he also striked up a conversation as well, he was so Friendly and so Concernced, it made you feel so Comfortable to be there it was like you were eating at Home.  Customer Service lacks a lot in today's world and it's Great to see it again. So it's a Double Bonus to get Great Tasting Food and Awesome Customer Service! It's Great to see a Small Business Thrive in today's Economy.",

They know that they are getting good word of mouth through Yelp, seem to know if you are a yelper, and go the extra mile to make sure they get a 5 star review.  I will be honest though, I have not personally ordered pizza for myself from Biaggio's, mainly because I love their chicken wings.  Yes they are lightly breaded, but they give a light crisp and travel well.  They are also smart enough to carry the hot sauce on the side without asking.  My husband however, really loves the pizza, stromboli, and occasionally a calzone.  The calzone sometimes does not travel well, so be forewarned, especially if you order a meat lovers as my husband does.  It can get occasionally greasy.",

I had also mentioned that Biaggio had given me his card and said to ask for him when I called and he would take great care of us, It just so happened Biaggio was out of town that day but his staff was just as amazing as the time we went into the restaurant.

Setting the bar high can be setting yourself up for failure in the case of food but Biaggios delivery driver showed up quickly and was very very friendly and when he handed over the boxes of Cheesy amazingness everyone dug in.. From this experience I know for a fact Biaggios picked up at least 5 more customers, especially when I started telling them about the wings and calzones.   Once again Biaggios hammers it out of the park, Thank you and we will be back again.",

    "text": "This is the perfect pizza place with the best pizza ever.  Located in a beautiful suburb of Las Vegas but so worth the trip.  If you miss rush hour it is only 15 minutes from downtown and worth the trip.  My son had the meat lover's pizza.  A beautiful looking pizza that tastes even better than it looks and that's saying a lot.  The sausage we were told was from a old family recipe as were the meatballs.  You have never had sausage like this sausage. My wife had the white pizza and it was delicious too.  I always have pepperoni and olive which was delicious but I think this menu needs to be explored.  Wish I was a local.   We finished the meal by splitting cheesecake to die for.  The cheesecake alone is worth the trip. If you want to get away from the casinos and tourist food and have some real food in a family restaurant, jump in the car, get away from the casino madness, and enjoy a great meal at Biaggio's.    As we sat there it was clear that they treat everybody that comes in as family.  Don't miss it.",

    "text": "You have to love Yelp.  I've lived in Las Vegas for decades, and tried this little neighborhood gem for the first time based on Yelp's reviews.  Biaggio's is about a mile and a half from my residence.  From the outside it looks like so many other mom and pop pizza joints that are sprinkled thoughout the city.  But once you walk in the door, you notice that this restaurant is different.  The place sparkles with pride of ownership, and I was greeted by it's owner with a smile and a handshake when I walked in the door.    A glass display case in at the register displays the samples of food that they offer in a very appealing way, that makes you want to order them all.  There are tables both inside and outside the restaurant, that almost makes the small eating area look large.  The place isn't elaborate, but the tables and chairs are clean and solidly built, and floor looks like you could use the three second rule if food was dropped.  We ordered the chicken wings with blue cheese dressing, and a meatball parm sub.  The wings (10) were crispy, fairly small, and not overly greasy. On a scale of 1 to ten I'd give them a solid 8.  They were filling, tasty, and I'd order them again.  The meatball parm sandwich was good, but not great.  The meatballs were huge, and covered with an abundance of cheese.  On a scale of one to ten, I'd rate them a 7.5.  the roll was toasted, good, but not great.  It was a very filling.  Would I go back there again... A definite yes.  Great food for a football crowd on a Sunday afternoon.  Thanks Yelp for steering me here.",

    "text": "We've been to Biaggio's twice this week already! Once on Monday and the second time on Thursday, but it's always been to go.  The fiance ordered pizza and wings on Monday. THE WINGS ARE TO DIE FOR! I'm pretty much addicted to their wings and could eat them all the time. The wings are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside dipped in ranch and hot sauce, its just irresistible. The pizza I thought was good, but nothing like out of this world. We just got the plain pepperoni on one half and mushrooms and sausage on the other half.  Last night we decided to try a stromboli. It was actually bigger than I had thought it was going to be. We went with the Chicken with artichokes and red pepper. I loved the artichokes in it, but other than that I think I would stick with the 6.99 stromboli's vs our specialty stromboli which was 12.99. Both meals ended up around 30 bucks, which seems a lil pricey for some pie and wings. I definitely will be back for the wings though.",

    "text": "I'm not a pizza connoisseur. In New York, I choose to have cupcakes. In Rome, I choose to have gnocchi. You get the idea. My idea of a good pizza is Papa John's with lots of the garlic butter. I just like pizza that tastes good. I honestly don't care or know how authentic any pizza is. On a certain weekday, I had a craving for cheese and marinara and decided to get a pizza.   I came to Biaggio's with a friend and we each ordered 2 slices of pizza. These slices are huge. One slice was actually more than enough for me. I ordered the cheese and Biaggio suggested I get the artichoke and roasted tomato slice. I'm not a fan of artichokes so I wasn't exactly excited but decided to take him up on that suggestion ($6.64 for 2 slices and the largest soft drink I've held in my hand).  The cheese pizza was fine but the other slice with the artichokes and tomatoes was out of this world. It had little pieces of roasted garlic on it that just brought the pizza to the next level.   My friend had the combination pizza and said it was good. She was eyeballing their breakfast pizzas (eggs instead of marinara) and Biaggio was nice enough to give her a slice on the house.   Biaggio is a nice guy that seemed genuinely interested in all his customers (the place was pretty much full during lunch). He is very passionate about his food and business as all the reviews suggest. Do also note  that the place is rather small with a handful of booths so if you're rolling in with a posse you might want to call ahead.  I would like to try some of the other items on the menu (calzones, salads) and this will be my go-to pizza joint when I need a slice. Oh, I'll still be loyal to Papa John's and their garlic butter when I need a whole pie!",

We walked in, were greeted by Biaggio (the owner) and his staff and grabbed a seat. We ordered a medium supreme pizza and a slice of cheese pizza for my two year old. While waiting they brought out a complimentary meatball and some bread. The meatball was amazing -- made in-house with a mixture of pork, veal, and some other stuff I don't remember.  The wait for the pizza took a little while and when Biaggio checked on our order he found out that they made a meat lovers pizza by mistake. He came out and apologized and said that he would bring it out so we could munch on it while our correct order was being made. The meat lovers pizza was delicious, filled with house made sausage and bacon. Our supreme came out a short time after and that pizza was equally amazing. One of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. Despite all the cheese and sauce the crust remained crispy. That's something other pizzerias fail at.  They boxed up the pizza we couldn't finish and on our way out they thanked us for coming and said if it wasn't a five-star experience he'd make it one next time. While I don't normally like it when businesses solicit stellar reviews from customers, the food and service was so good that I can't give them anything less than top marks. Now that Ciao Ciao is closed this will no doubt be our go-to pizza joint.",

Although they do have seats here, if I ever came back I would just order the pizza to go (believe they also do delivery). They have pictures of their pizza with each ingredient on the walls and an easy menu to order with. My party ordered an x-large half BBQ chicken half supreme. There was only one employee but service was great. Pizza was delicious. It was thin, soft, not dry, and full of flavor. The x-large was very big, probably can feed about 4-5 adults. Overall, great experience here, wouldn't mind coming back, and definitely worth a try.",

It was way too much food for our family and we had leftovers for 3 days. My only disappointment was the salad, but it wasn't a huge deal.

    "text": "I really wish I loved this place as much as everyone else does because it is ridiculously close to where I live. Unfortunately, it fell short of the hype.  I ordered delivery from Biaggio's and everything went fine, nice person over the phone, delivery was on time (you'd hope so since I could literally walk there). My gripe was with the pizza itself, along with the side orders I had.  I've had pizza in NYC, this is not NYC style. The crust is much thicker, the sauce was thick and the cheese made a hard layer over the top. You know that kind of cheese, that would all just come off in one piece? It was like that. The crust itself had small bumps on the bottom which means it was probably baked in a pizza tray, and not just tossed and slid into the oven. All of this is perfectly acceptable if this is your taste, but it's not for me.  I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, and the salad came topped with olives, cheese, tomatoes and cucumber. The tomatoes were mealy and tasteless because they had been in the fridge for too long. The dressing wasn't as sharp as I'd like and I ended up adding some red wine vinegar at home.  I ordered the zucchini sticks specifically because it said \"sticks.\" I hate zucchini rounds, because when they're cut like that, they get overcooked and loose their texture. It also means a lot more breading, and rounds are always breadcrumbs. I like zucchini sticks that are beer battered, and was hoping these would be like that, but knew not to expect the beer batter. I was disappointed, since I was expecting sticks at least.  All of these things I think mostly come down to a preference, but I didn't see the same quality everyone else did. I might end up giving this place another try, but with Those Guys also in the vicinity, it'll be tough for me to break away after my first experience.",

Also , we ordered both pizza and calzone medium, we got home and opened the larger box expecting the pizza, but it was the calzone. Pizza was small for a medium.",

I have a new rule - when megabucks or Powerball lotto jackpots exceed $100 million, I drive to the NV/Cali border to buy tickets.  well, they are both currently over $100 million so on Wednesday, post work out, I start the drive, but, it is lunch time and since Biaggio's is nearby, how about a few slices to go ?  I opt for the two slice soda special costing $6.  While waiting, talked to owner about how long it's been since my last visit.  The owner is a hoot - an old school guy !  the slices took a little longer than it should given they were not busy - who knows, maybe it was a fresh pie being cooked.  Anyways, the pizza was above average.  First of all, I was appreciated of having bite sized pieces of sausage on top - seems simple enough but last several pizza experiences involved \"sausage strips\"  not to my liking.  I really liked the crust - thin but not paper thin, had a crunch to it yet also some softness, too. could have used a tad bit more sauce but not a major issue.  Overall, worth a return if i'm hankering for pizza post-work out or in the area for other escapades.  pic included",

The pizza was good and I wish I would have just ordered that. Everything was overpriced for what you get, also not so good. The chicken tastes like Tyson frozen chicken. You get 3 tiny fingers with no fries for 7.99. The wings (which are totally overbreaded) are sold $1 each. Again, no fries. Neither came with a meal option so I ordered an order of fries at 3.99 figuring we could share, wow the order was small! The fries have that slight breading FYI. Glad we ordered a large pizza as I ended up not finishing my wings.",

First, the food was great, and the lunch special was cheap too! Definitely get the garlic knots, but above the food I want to mention the service. I saw more compassion in my twenty minuet lunch than I did the better part of this year. The gentlemen that worked there was so friendly and a great server, but more so just a kind person. A man came in who was having trouble with his motor functions, the man who worked there helped him walk over to his table, returned the change to this patrons pocket when he couldn't and just went so far beyond what was required of his job. That made my day more so than the food. If you don't give this place a shot, you're the one missing out in more ways than one.",

A small place with some seating outside.  The deli counter is just an example of what they have, but you can order and make any pizza you want even if it's just by the slice.  Their lunch special is two slices of pizza and a drink  for $6 and change.  I came here on a pizza mission, I live two minutes away I can't wait to get home!",

He was friendly, and made it known that he wanted his customers to enjoy excellent tasting, high quality food. He delivered on this.   I got 2 good sized slices of pizza, which were delicious, garden salad with grilled chicken, which was decent, and a large fountain drink, all for $10 & some change. Great pizza at a great price. I'd return and recommend to a friend for sure.",

The garlic knots are insanely tasty - had I just eaten them, my rating would have two extra stars.  Now onto the pizza. It's disgusting. The crust tastes like cardboard...with less flavor. I've eaten bad pizza before, but I've at least been able to get an entire piece down. It was all I could do to get 2/3 of one slice down.  Another thing that irked me - and this could've been only because I was so dissatisfied with the pizza - was that the waitress was TOO on top of things. She was at my table every 3 bites of food asking how it was, if she could bring us anything etc. While trying to eat a meal and have a nice post work, Friday evening conversation, I felt like I had an unwanted guest at my table. Again, this was likely due to me being upset with the pizza quality, but none the less, it was enough for me to notice it being annoying.",

I got there 30 mins after ordering and it wasn't ready. They asked me 5 different times what my order was and never followed up to let me know what the status was. They guy next to me was waiting longer than me and just ended up leaving. That should have been my sign. After an additional 25 mins of waiting, I finally got my order... Or so I thought.  Got back home to eat my pepperoni, mushroom, olive pizza with a greek salad; and they gave me a green pepper, mushroom, olive pizza with an Italian salad. Needless to say, I was boiling! Why people like this place is beyond me. I tried to eat what I had but it wasn't even good. The dough was flavorless and nothing special. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

I forgot to mention that the employees were so friendly and kind to everyone in the restaurant. The pizza came on time and I took the pizza home and the pizza was delicious! The sausage had a lot of spices and tasted very exquisite, the crust was toasty and soft at the same time. Overall delicious and amazing employees will buy again.",

    "text": "I'll start off first with a simple PRO and CONS list for those of you that don't want to read my rambling review. :)  PROS:  *I got the Italian sub and it was delicious!  *The wait staff was extremely friendly. * Very reasonable prices. *It's local and very family oriented, you feel good giving your money to support  local  business. *The interior was very clean and cozy, a great place to bring a casual date.  CONS: * The display case were you order your food is very off putting. I don't think it's even real food but meant as a display. Its a bad idea, when I first saw it I got a lump in my throat the the food was going to suck. Bad first impression. *Even though I appreciated the friendliness of everyone some people might not enjoy the enthusiasm. I could see that someone who is shy or not much for talk feeling a little uncomfortable.  I visited Biaggio's on Friday 5/25 due to the good reviews on Yelp. When I walked in, there were a group of people sitting at the booth tables to my left; one of the men at the table waved to me like an old friend and at the same time the people behind the register also greeted me. I got a little disoriented by all the greetings but it was nice to feel welcome.   I took a look at the menu and decided to so for the Italian sub. The man that initially waved from the booth then got up and came behind the front counter and asked me if I wanted it made a certain way, and additions or subtractions to the original sandwich. Which was nice that he was thorough, I just told him to make it how he thinks is best. :) I'm not sure if that was the owner or not but he had that air about him, so probably.   I order my sandwich to go, so I sat down at one of the booths to wait. While I was waiting the girl I ordered from came over and asked if I wanted anything to drink while I waited, which I thought was really nice since I hadn't paid for a drink. I just said a water would be great, but still the thought was nice. I know some people said that the wait staff were almost TOO friendly to the point of being an annoyance. The girl that brought me a water, I had a feeling that she wanted to come over again and ask me if I needed anything else, which would have been silly because I was waiting for a to-go order. So she seemed to refrain herself. :) I wonder if they'd read the reviews! lol None the less I thought she was sweet.  I only waited about 8 minutes, which I thought was a reasonable amount of time. Got up to leave and everyone waved a warm adieu. I got home to eat my sandwich and it was fabulous! It had a variety of peppers, onions and I think an olive tapenade with oil and was seasoned wonderfully. The meat and cheeses were of high quality, the bread seemed fresh, crusty enough on the outside and soft on the inside.   Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back. :)",

When the order did not come in 1.5 hours, I called and Mr. Biaggio got right on the phone to apologize and make it up to me, which he did so in hospitable fashion.  It's rare that the owner of a business addressess the day to day issues so directly and the value of that touch is certainly not lost on me.

The place looks small from the outside, but it can sit around 40 people comfortably.   We (including my cousin) all came  WA, CA, TX, FL, and NJ, and none of us live in Las Vegas.

    "text": "Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to the reviews we read. We were the only customers in the restaurant when we walked in. During our entire experience, the owner was sitting across from us and didn't acknowledge the poor service we had. We ordered the pizza and meatball sub since we read all about it on this website. Pizza came out and it was ok. Nothing special. I grew up in NY and it's definitely not close to what you get there. So our next hope was the meatball sub except it never came! Once they brought the pizza out, no one ever came back over to refill drinks, etc. When we finished eating, the waitress finally came over and my husband said \"so I guess we aren't getting our meatball sub?\" She goes oh and walks away, says something to the owner and he says to her \"you took the order\". We ask for our bill and walk out. There was no apology for the oversight from the waitress or the owner. Needless to say, with subpar food and poor service we won't be back. An experience we were looking forward to definitely ended up to be pretty disappointing.",

I have eaten at Biaggio's 2 times now and I've had the 2 slice special each time and my girlfriend normally gets the meatball for us to split it all. The pizza is good for the price but I think there sandwiches especially the meatball sandwich is amazing. I think I heard it's an old grandma recipe for the meatball and they are great. Meadium sized but just right with soft bread.   When we go we always get an order of garlic knots with the marinarra because they are a must have with any meal because they are delicious.   Finish it all of with fried dough and your out the door for under a $20 eating for two.   The Vegas Villains",

This place absolutely lived up to the high ratings and high reviews left by other fellow \"yelpers\".  One of my teammates got the Calzone and it was epic!  Massive calzone and great flavor.  We all tried some and agreed it was the best we have had.  This was by far the largest calzone I have ever seen..... hands down.  Myself and another teammate ordered the meatball sub.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about how good this sub was.  Not only was the sub amazing, Mr. Biaggio (the owner) came by and was very friendly, letting us know the history of the recipe as well as the level of care and attention to detail put into making the sandwich. This is a level of services that I haven't seen in a long time from any restaurant.    Overall great experience from the excellent food and superb customer services.  Highly recommended that if you local to Las Vegas or just visiting to check this place out.",

There was 6 of us, one man, a couple of delicate flower eaters, and a few more enthusiatic ones.  I never want to commit the party foul of not enough food, so I ordered two meat lover's strombolis and 12 garlic knots.  It was a lot of food because we had also made a large salad to accompany our take-out.  Well, the stromboli was so juicy and deeeeeeeeeelicious, that even our little delicate flowers were taking thirds!!  Yikes!  We almost ran out.  I have had pizza from here before and it too was fabulous.  You can eat in.  The place is small but cute.  The proprietor is very friendly and accomodating.  You must give it a try!",

    "text": "I stopped by to get a couple of slices and a drink... I'm happy I did!  This is simply the best tasting pizza you will find anytime soon. The crust had a crispy almost crunchy texture, the sauce was homemade with no added sugar and the entire pizza was cooked perfect.  We went again today and tried the meatballs and also the Philly. The bread on the Philly was fresh and toasted, the meat was not oily or dry and the whole sandwich was very good.   The meatballs... Don't tell my wife, (she is Italian and loves to cook) but they were better than homemade. They were moist and you could actually taste the Parmesan and the garlic...delicious!   UPDATE: 3/20/2011  We returned here because we were craving a great pizza and it appears there have been some changes at Biaggio's. Here's the skinny:   1. It appears they are acquiring their crust from a new source. Usually, the crust is rolled thin and cooks crispy and has a good flavor. This pizza had a crust that appeared to have been rolled, and waited too long rising to be made into a crust. It contained excess amounts of flower which made it taste burnt even though it was undercooked. I also ordered a calzone just to sample how it was prepared. It turned out to be simply another over flowered too thick pizza crust that was folded and pinched on the ends. Again, it tasted burnt and appeared burnt, even though it was under cooked as the cheese was not entirely melted inside.   I am only downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 3 instead of a 2 because the staff is very friendly, and the dining area and bathroom was clean. I know Mr. Biaggio can do better. It was great the first time we were there.",

    "text": "Came here for the Pizza Train Yelp event and I didn't want to leave!  The food here was incredible, oddly enough though the felt the pizza wasn't the best item on the menu.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza here is pretty darn good.  The crust in not too thick and doughy, nor is it thin and crispy.  It is just the right combination of thickness and texture.  Personally, I felt there were two outstanding items on the menu: the buffalo wings and the pastrami stromboli.  I felt these two items were better than the pizza, the homemade family recipe meatballs, and the super-garlicky garlic knots.   First, the buffalo wings.  They were moist, tender, flavorful on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The skin was seasoned just right, not too salty and it wasn't oily or flaking off the wings.  I normally don't like buffalo wings, but I could barely get enough of these.  Also, the sauce for the wings comes on the side, so you can customize the flavor you want or just eat them plain!  Second, the pastrami stomboli.  At first I though what a strange filling for stromboli, but when Biaggio, himself, suggested adding mustard and pickles to it, WOW, it was great!  The mustard and pickles really complemented and brought out the flavors of the pastrami.  There wasn't too much bread or cheese, just enough to add a bit of chewiness and texture to the stromboli.  Lastly, the pastrami stromboli is not on the take out menu, but definitely ask for it!  If savory dishes are not your cup of tea, they also have a limited selection of desserts: italian cookies, canolli, and biscotti.  If you are an early bird, they also have breakfast.  Breakfast at a pizza place is something I have never heard of.  Bagels and doughnuts, along with breakfast pizza.  Or if you are recovery from a late night bender, they will make you a regular pizza for breakfast.  Pretty cool.  Lastly, the customer service of the restaurant put it over the top and earned it five stars.  This place really does put the customer first.  It is pretty much a family run store and everyone was super friendly and welcoming.  Everyone tried to make the dining experience perfect.  Definitely returning for more wings and stromboli and pizza if there is still room.",

I brought some in to my work and the reception was incredible!  Noone wanted to try it at first. but as soon as one person had some, everyone wanted it and they all loved it!    I even found out that breakfast pizza isn't as weird as I thought it was.  Several of my staff from the midwest indicated that they'd been looking for it!  So... how does it work?  It's not made with pizza sauce or cheese!  Well... there might be cheese, but I'm actually not too sure!  Instead of cheese, it was actually a pizza crust with a thin layer of EGG!  Then the breakfast toppings such as bacon or sausage came into play.  When you first order it, the crust is nice and crisp, just what I expect from Biaggio's.  The texture is great, the flavors are fantastic, and it's a pleasant change of pace.",

Biaggio at Biaggio's Pizzeria has set out to ensure that all of his customers get just that.    We are getting married in Vegas this February and I contacted Biaggio after reading all of the awesome Yelp reviews.  Biaggio's enthusiasm was so infectious on the call that I couldn't help but decide to have the reception with this pizzeria without even consulting my other half.    Biaggio kept using these seductive words like \"stromboli\", \"lasagna\", and \"cannoli\" to name a few.  We decided to have a second phone discussion after I actually told my fiance about the reception so that we could finalize the menu.  Unfortunately....I forgot to call!  No worries, I called the restaurant and the next morning when he got the message, Biaggio called me right away.  Then he gave me his cell phone number so that I would never miss him again.  It turns out he is only ever out of the pizzeria on Tuesday nights from 6:30pm on, so I could probably catch him there...nonetheless, he wanted me to be able to get hold of him at all times.  That's what I call commitment to customers!    After this discussion, we finalized our menu.  We are starting with three kinds of stromboli --pastrami, chicken & artichoke, and meatball & garlic as well as a salad that will include roasted tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and three kinds of cheese (amongst other tasties).  The main course will include lasagna, garlic knots, and sausage & peppers.  I'm not sure we will still have space for dessert, but just in case, we ordered cannoli, donuts, and he is throwing in 4 lbs of cookies that his friend who makes the cannoli's makes for free.    On top of the menu, there will be two people to assist with all prep and mealtime issues; the chef will be on hand, and Biaggio himself will be there to help.  He's even shutting the restaurant down from 6pm to 9pm on a Sunday for us.  Talk about service!!!  Biaggio has requested that when we get down to Vegas we stop by to try all of the items that he will be serving, to ensure they are just what we want.  If they aren't, he assures me he will switch them out with something we do like.    This man and this pizzeria have impressed me beyond measure--and I haven't even tried the food yet!  Anyone with this level of commitment to his business and who speaks of his food in such glowing terms is someone I want to do business with.    After the reception I will do an additional review on the food.  If it's even half as impressive as Biaggio himself, I'm 100% sure it will be a 5 star review.",

My friends and I went to Biaggio's because I was amazed at how good their ratings were.  When we arrived we were the only ones there so the owner came out from the kitchen to talk with us. The owner, Biaggio, just emanates with pride in knowing that he uses the freshest and finest ingredients whenever possible.  My friends and I order two vegetarian pizzas, one with mushrooms spinach and ricotta and another with eggplant and garlic, garlic knots, and french fries.  The garlic knots arrived first and they were amazingly moist and garlicky.  When the pizza arrived we were in for a real treat.  The first pizza we received was the mushroom spinach and ricotta.  The first bite was simply delicious.  In my previous experience both mushrooms and spinach have the tendency to make the crust of any pizza turn into a watery mess within a matter of minutes; but Biaggio's crust is quite nearly perfect.  The crust had the right balance of crunch and chewy, yet it held up to all the toppings without going limp, unlike the certain times when I eat at Grimaldi's.  The next pizza arrived, the eggplant is battered and fried before its topped on the pizza, which was a very nice surprise.     Both the quality of the ingredients and the friendliness of Biaggio will have me going back there many times.",

My brother and I tried the white pizza, the Philly Cheesesteak and the garlic knots with Biaggio's signature marinara sauce.  All were terrific, as other reviewers can attest.  I'm a huge fan of marinara sauce, and you won't find a better sauce elsewhere!  My brother and I got a chance to talk to the owner for awhile about his restaurant and felt at home, we've never been treated friendlier.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!",

This alone will make me go back because you don't get that alot anymore. Second, the food was OFF THE CHAIN!!!! It was absolutly delicious, from the garlic bread knots, to the crispy chicken wings, to the antipasta salad to the all meat pizza.  And OMG lets not forget about the desserts, TO DIE FOR!!!!! Mr. Biaggio you got a customer for life.   See you next time when I'm in Vegas.",

The Philly Cheesesteak was  authentic ( I'm from  Northeast Philly) although they use real cheese- not Cheese Wiz-  We sampled the delicious New York style Pizza and a variety of desserts which were extraordinary.  I asked Biaggio where he grew up in New York and he said \" Lived in California all my life\"  Go figure!",

We had a large pizza with meatballs, mushrooms and ricotta cheese . All the ingredients tasted fresh, the crust was very good , thin crisp and had a nice chew.  We also had the chix wings , I don't usually order chix wings at a pizza place , but all the positve reviews on these wings i had to try them . The wings are very good and don't need no sauce .       I also ordered the italian sub , all I can say is wow lots of meat( salami , capicola.)  The owner is very friendly and proud of his food as he should be.",

The crust is also something to be happy about. I'm generally not a fan of pizza crust, but Biaggio's has the bet texture.  I must also add that speaking to Biaggio is always entertaining. He is one of the nicest people I have met and he's always happy to make delicious suggestions!",

We were immediately greeted by Biaggio and he was so nice.  Our waitress, his daughter, was equally fantastic.  She was quick and friendly. While waiting for our order, Biaggio chatted us up about his pizza.  We didn't order pizza but he insisted we try it so he gave us a couple slices.  OMG it was good.  I've been so disappointed with pizza lately that I've pretty much given it up.  My pizza strike is now over.  First we had the garlic knots, so good.  Then Biaggio brings out a few wings for the hubby to try, he enjoyed them very much.  The ranch and the blue cheese dressings are both homemade. Very tasty.  I ordered the cheese steak, it was delicious.  Cheesy and full of onions and the meat was tender and flavorful. Hubby had the baked ziti and loved it. Biaggio brought him out a meat ball that was also delicious.  Our three year old, who is extremely picky said it was the best place ever.  For dessert, we had zeppole. wow, I'd never had it before but it was doughy, sugary little bites of heaven and the raspberry dipping sauce was amazing.  The value for the price is great. The portions are huge and the service is great. We will certainly be back soon and often",

    "text": "This is by far the best Pizzeria I've ever been to. As soon as I walked in, Mr. Biaggio welcomed me with a big smile. He treated me like a regular even though it was my first time in there. I'd give it 5 stars just for the excellent customer service (seriously, I don't think you can find any better customer service than at this place)! I arrived a bit early (for pickup) and before I could even sit down, Mr. Biaggio came over and gave me a bottle of water. Even before I left with the pizza, Mr. Biaggio came running over and said, \"Let me check to see if it's perfect.\" Can you name another pizza place that does that?   Now on to the food. It's seriously the closest thing to New York style pizza you can find here in Vegas. The crust is perfect..not too thin..not too thick. I ordered the pepperoni pizza, and boy, do they pile the pepperoni on! I also had the buffalo wings and just like Mr. Biaggio said himself, \"They are to die for!\". They were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of crunch to them. And the buffalo sauce was delicious! I also tried the garlic knots and yum...they had a bit of a crunch to them but were soft enough to melt in your mouth. My brother, who is a very picky eater, said that if he could rate it from 1-10, he would rate it a 12. I'll definitely be back! And I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about this wonderful place (in fact, I already started that, hahah). Mr. Biaggio, if you're reading this, thank you for everything tonight! Thank you for making me feel welcomed and treating me like an old friend. I can tell that you really truly care about the quality of your food and the customers. I can assure you this won't be the last time you see me! :D",

They were tasty - warm, fresh and chewy, but those at the bottom were in a pool of butter. It was not appetizing to me, but my brother loved those drenched in all that garlicky butter. We went with a classic large pepperoni. I thought the crust was really great, crisp and chewy. And it held up well, a feat for NY Style. It was the greasiness that I didn't love. Cheese and pepperoni, should be greasy, but this was more than my arteries could handle. I'd return for veggie pizza or maybe a stromboli or calzone. I heard a waiter talking up the zeppoles for dessert. If I was ever able to save room I'd give those a whirl too.",

This was delivered to the office over the weekend, along with Caesar salad and garlic knots and the staff couldn't get enough. You know a restaurant is good when you want to rave about every item you had not just one thing in particular.   Surprisingly, living in the area I've never even heard of the place but now I'm addicted, I'll be back with my husband this week.   (So much for losing that post-baby weight, it's worth it!)",

We will be back and the white sauce is unbelievable, the thin crust was rolled out when our order was placed. It was amazing, I love the edges, bf eats my leftovers from the 2nd piece!",

The salad was the biggest hit and the wings were decent. The pizza was... Utterly forgettable, and pizza is my FAVORITE FOOD - from gestation to this very day! There is literally too much competition in this arena for me to ever consider Biaggio's for PIZZA again!  I was stuck betwixt Niko's and Biaggio's, and though my gut was screaming \"Niko's!\" I chose Biaggio's due to the volume of reviews and resulting high average... Which is why I was compelled to write this review!  * Sauce lacked flavor, big time * Cheese was seriously not great * Crust/dough was a solid foundation darn good actually (This is where the greatness ended)  Thank you for your attention",

Biaggio's one of the top rated places in the area and she had never even heard of it! Needless to say, an extra large pepperoni pizza later we were both sold on it and are pretty sure it's one of the best pizza's we have ever had.  Can't wait to be back again! I might even take a trip from Henderson to have it anyway! Side note, I did have an order of wings. You can get them individually, so you aren't forced to get 12 or 8. At .99 cents each, I felt that was too expensive for wings. They also are not tossed in sauce, it is on the side. Kind of weird. But you go to a pizza place for PIZZA, not wings.",

The gentleman who greeted & waited on us was very nice (I'm sad that I didn't catch his name). He was very attentive and showed a lot of appreciation. I would assume he owns the joint(?). Regardless, the customer service was great.  We ordered a TON of food:  Garlic Knots - these were huge! I was expecting bite size garlic knots; these were more fist-sized. The soft doughy center was easily complimented by the perfectly baked exterior that featured a slight crunch. I do, however, wish there was a ton more garlic on these. I absolutely love garlic & that flavor was lacking, in my opinion.  Fried Mushrooms - YUM! It is rare to find fried mushrooms that aren't completely hidden behind breading.  These were the perfect ratio.  Chicken Wings - another customer stated, \"they have the best chicken wings in town\" while he saw me flipping through the menu. These were definitely delicious. The wings were moist & tender - served with buffalo sauce & ranch.  Pizza - half Meat Lover's (sub salami for mushrooms) & half White Pizza. The pizza was good - I wouldn't say it's the greatest I've ever had; but it was certainly delicious. The Meat Lover's side had a very generous amount of pepperoni, italian sausage, meatballs & mushrooms. The White Pizza side was tasty as well - I love ricotta cheese!  Thumbs up for overall experience!",

I really enjoy Biaggio's ... not only because the food is amazing. It's that I can see where my money goes.   When you support some big chain who treats your community members poorly, their kids who work for these establishments are bodies to fill a space and not respected or trained properly.   I urge you whenever you want pizza, fried chicken... pull out your phone and find a local restaurant you can support while also getting your needs met.   Thank you for providing an awesome locally owned and operated choice for me!!!!",

Pizza and wings always sound like a good idea for late night cravings.  We ordered a XL supreme pizza and wings. The wings were delicious !  Super crispy, perfect amount of crunch, and juicy warm meat.  Being a pizza joint, the pizza was ok.  Nothing too special or nothing to rave about.  I would've liked it if the pizza crust was a little bit thicker to be able to hold a slice in my hand.  Overall, they accomplished their task of satisfying our late night cravings.  $45 for a XL pizza and 20 wings is a bit little pricey, but if I was in the neighborhood I would definitely come back for the wings.",

The only item I was dissapointed in was the Meatball hero (or sub). It was SUPER small. I don't remember exactly how much it was, but I would have paid a little more to have a bigger portion. The owner brags about how his place is similar to an NY joint...the pizza, maybe. But the Meatball hero needs some work. I will definately be back for some pizza.  P.S- VERY strange that a pizza place is closed on Sundays. I worked in about 3 different pizza places, and each one of them Sunday football was the second busiest day of the week. Maybe they should re-consider?",

    "text": "Pizza was hit and miss... sometimes it tasted very good, other times it was hard or soggy, but I leave this one star review for 2 reasons.  They both have to do with customer service.   1.  We were delighted to find out that they would deliver to us even though we live way out East.... I also found on their website that it specifically says \"We deliver anywhere in the valley!\"  So they delivered to us 5 times as there really aren't that many decent options on the East side.  Even though some times they charged $4 for delivery and others they charged $8 we were ok with that and we still tipped generously.  When we tried to order for the 6th time, I was told they would no longer deliver to our  location.  Evidently his drivers are privately employed even though they are still representing his company.    2.  This all probably stemmed from the 5th delivery where we ordered ONLINE over $70 worth of pizzas and calzones for a group.  The total actually came to around $72 (including $4 delivery which the website stated), when the driver arrived he told us the total was $83.  I even had him come inside and showed him the website with the totals.  Well, when the owner called me and informed me that his drivers refused to deliver to us he informed me that the problem was that I was going by the pricing on the website and that was not updated, the extra toppings had gone up by .25 cents each.   Well, I still struggle to see how this is my issue as they need to update their website pricing to reflect their correct amounts or turn off their online ordering.  I was a bit taken back by this interaction because it felt like I was being blamed for the price discrepancy when it had nothing to do with me.  So obviously, all of his drivers got together and decided not to deliver to my house anymore (because it was too far) is what I was told.    Well bottom line is, they need to fix their website if they TRULY are not delivering ANYWHERE in the valley... otherwise, it's clearly just my house that they chose not to deliver to.  Also, they need to update their website to reflect their correct pricing and if it is not correct they need to stand by their prices as it's not the customer's job to know when they raise their prices.",

I got the grease & carb fix I had been desperately craving.   We ordered a large, Ham & Pineapple plus extra cheese through their online ordering system.   When I ordered it said the extra cheese was $3.50 extra and I didn't really care, but a lady from the pizzeria called me about 5 min. later to apologize and recalculate total as this was an error and extra cheese is the same as other toppings: $1.50. That was nice... I'm sure other places wouldn't have bothered calling or recalculating.  Pizza got to my house in about half an hour on a Friday night and the delivery lady was really nice and smiling. That's always a good thing.   I felt that the pizza could have had more cheese, it seemed like it was a regular amount as opposed to extra like I requested but the quality of the cheese made up for it. I loveeeeed the cheese. I could order a cheese pizza from this place and be happy. The other toppings were tasty as well and felt fresh. Pineapple was juicy, ham was smokey and tender.  Only thing I would change - the pizza crust itself. Too thin! Like paper thin:( I know it's supposed to be NY style but I wish there was an option for a thicker pizza. That would make it a 5 star joint in my opinion. I hope to be able to visit the place in person soon!",

Their garlic knots are beyond yummy and their salads are HUGE and super fresh! The girl who answered the phone was so sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Delivery was within the time they said and the delivery guy was nice. I gave him and extra great tip for the super service! This is now my go-to pizza place!!",

I've tried to make GF pizza at home with some success but I really enjoyed theirs. We got the GF Supreme Pizza which has a thin crust, really good sauce, caramelized onions, mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage and peppers.  Also got it delivered using the online ordering- very easy and seamless, arrived in about an hour.  I am looking forward to trying the other GF dinner options they offer as well.  Husband has Celiac and he didn't get any kind of reaction so I really appreciate that- Thank you Biaggio's!",

    "text": "Enthusiasm is infectious and the owner of Biaggio is not lacking in that. A simple dinner after grabbing a few drinks turned into an educational forum on the process of pizza making and the care put into each item.  For some, this would be considered badgering, but I find it endearing. This man is proud of the product that he showcases, and rightfully so, minus our initial mistake. We had ordered the fries($3.50) to munch on while we waited for our pizza. Poor choice, because the serving was ridiculously small for the price. We had ordered the medium veggie pizza ($16.25) and I was hoping not to regret it. Thank goodness the next dish salvaged my waning interest. The owner came by to tell us some facts about the ingredients. The dough is made without sugar while the sauce does not use sugar or salt. The taste was simple and clean, a way a good pizza should be. The ingredients were fresh and had individual distinct flavors. The crust was magnificent; possessing a crisp snap and browned to perfection. Save room for dessert because the zeppoles ($3.25) are worth holding off for. The mountainous stack of bite sized pieces brought to mind an allusion to fluffy white clouds leading to Mt. Olympus. (Don't judge, Greek and Roman gods are one in the same.) Simply ambrosial with the raspberry and coconut glaze dipping sauces. The combination of both creates a wonderful pina colada taste.   On our way out, the owner told us to take a menu because they deliver all over the valley. Before we could inquire, he emphasized our area. So if you live in the Southwest and don't want to travel, this is an option. Just order enough to cover the trip charge.",

The pizza itself is delicious and fresh and boasts a crust that is chewy and crisp (how is that possible?); everything tastes just as good the next day.

I asked for sauce on the side, which they did. But they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti (not even enough for a child's portion IMO and it was hard and had obviously been sitting. There was literally more sauce than pasta.   The side salad with grilled chicken is $3 more than without, so I assumed they must give a decent sized piece of chicken with it. You know what they say when you assume, right? There was maybe half a cutlet's worth or pre-frozen, microwave grilled chicken (think McDonald's kind) on it.   So all in all, I paid almost $20 ($12 for the spaghetti and $7 for the salad) for what amounts to a child's portion of food (half of which was inedible). We got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing, so when I called to let them know I figured we could just work it out next time (we were happy with everything else) but the phone just rang and rang. We will definitely go somewhere else next time.",

Their food is made with so much love and they have excellent customer service! The owner comes to personally talk to you and makes sure that you're satisfied with your meal which is almost unnecessary because their pizza is SO good from the tip of the pizza to crust.   Aside from the pizza, you have to try their garlic knots and wings! They are so delicious. The garlic knots are topped off with Parmesan cheese and the wings are so good you could eat them without any dipping sauce.   I don't know why I haven't posted sooner but I was up late, came onto Yelp and saw two reviews from one time customers and had to give my opinion. Biaggio's deserves the FULL five stars. I'm from California and would come back to Vegas just for the experience of eating here! Try it for yourself!",

I cannot think of any particular reason why the pizza here is anything above just straight average and ultimately forgettable.  Delivery time was fair around 45 minutes. The major benefit of Biaggio's is that it seems to have no location restrictions for delivery. Their location is in West Las Vegas and they are willing to deliver to the strip. That is definitely a plus.   -Meat Lovers Pizza. Okay and nothing greater than that. Toppings, cheese, and sauce were all fine. The crust is definitely not. It is about as bland as it can come.  -White Pizza. Tried to order it with alterations and did not receive any. Again just average white pizza. Not enough garlic. Fairly bland.  It's not worth its own price points at all. It's more expensive than a chain pizza restaurant and definitely not any better. I can only rate pizza delivery in comparison to typical delivery chains. Biaggio's is NOT better than a pizza hut or a domino's. And Im not saying I like either of those chains that much because I don't. But does it justify straying away from the garlic knot stuffed crust at Pizza Hutt? Certainly not. Can it compete with Pizza Rock? Certainly not.  Skip!",

So I paid $57 and change for a large pizza with three toppings on half the pizza only (they charge $1 for each topping, even veggies, even if it's only on one half of the pizza. Fantastic...), fries, and some chicken fingers. So the choice of chicken fingers is $8 for three. Three. Or $21 for 10. Got 10 because I couldn't see paying $8 for only three.   Pizza came. The entire bottom of it was wet. Not because of the sauce. Wet like from water or condensation. Nasty. Pizza wasn't great. I was told it was \"the best\" and as a New Yorker, I'd be impressed. I'm impressed at how bad it was. The sauce was eh. The cheese wasn't good quality... The pizza didn't have a great taste. And it was completely soggy from the wetness. The leftovers weren't even good enough to save and reheat later. I threw it out. I never do that.   Chicken fingers. Thought maybe they'd be good ones--worth $8 for 3. Nope. Regular frozen fingers you can get ANYWHERE. In fact, I can name five places off the top of my head that serve the exact same ones. And none of them cost $8 for THREE fingers. And when you buy fingers, they don't give you ranch. You have to pay $1 extra for each. I told them they can kindly screw themselves. Was about to cancel my order and she said she'd \"take care of those\" for me. Oh how sweet of you.   The fries were mediocre. Nothing special to write home about. Wasn't worth almost $60 in total. And for the amount I paid for fries, I would have thought we'd get more of them.   Won't go back there. Ever. (This was a delivery order, but still... Either way.)  Wish I could get my money back.

Pizza: literally could count each of the toppings on the pizza. Cheap with their toppings!!!  Pizza was ok, not 4 star in my book.  Was not the kind of pizza where you eat the 1st slice and it kept you wanting more.  Tasted a bit doughy, maybe cause there wasn't enough sauce, or toppings.    Wings: was good but wasn't \"the bomb\" like the person that took my order made it out to be.  Ranch was additional charge.   Did not come with it.  Would I go back...no.  This place is nothing out of the ordinary,  not worth the trip.  Much rather go to Custom Built Pizza where the toppings actually cover the pizza.  They are both ok pizza, but if I had to choose between the two.   Custom Built would be my choice due to the fact that of the generous toppings.  Grimaldi's still have the best tasting pizza.  Just don't like that its so thin.",

Crust isn't too bad, but a tad bit doughy in places.   Again, only second visit so take with a grain of salt. Just nothing better than the chains and more expensive, so...",

We ordered a large Pizza half veggies and half pepperoni and sausage, a kids pizza (which was really a good size) and a side salad! This fed myself and my husband and two small boys. This slices are nice and big, the crust and toppings are fresh and delicious. The spaghetti sauce taste homemade and the salad was very good!   Unfortunately they don't deliver to where I live but because of  the reviews I decided to pick it up and I'm so glad I did. The gentleman on the phone was very nice and even more pleasant in person.

    "text": "I rarely write reviews because quite frankly I'm lazy, but i HAD to write this review and tip my hat and give a huge high five to Biaggio's Pizza. We decided to try them on a whim based on others yelp reviews. I downloaded the Slice app and put in an order for delivery. It took about an hour from order to landing on my door step (during peak hours that's pretty impressive). We ordered a large pepperoni, large cheese, baked ziti and a cannoli with delivery and tip the cost was just under $62. The pizza and ziti arrived piping hot and the cannoli cold and fresh. I've got to say as a born and raised Vegas local this has to be in my top 3 best pizza places I have EVER tried! The crust was perfect, the sauce was amazing, toppings were generous and to perfection. The ziti was very tasty, the noodles were al dente and not mushy. The sauce was a perfect marinara and it was very cheesy, just as ziti should be. Now let's get to the Cannoli. Oh my the cannoli. I practically inhaled that delicious treat because it was simply irresistible.  To make a long story short Biaggio's is now our spot. We will be return customers time and again. Any pizza place that has great customers service, great food and delivers has got my business and then some. I will be singing Biaggio's praises to all of my friends and anyone that wants to know where to get some of the best pizza in town. I can't wait to go try these guys in the restaurant.",

We searched yelp for a great pizza and decided to go here. From the moment the phone was answered to take my take-out order it was easy, kind and just what I was hoping for. Ordered a simple medium pepperoni pizza and Greek salad light in the feta and dressing on the side. OMG YESSSSSS!!! How do you determine a GREAT Pizza?!?!? Well it's the crust, then the sauce...NAILED BOTH!!!! Seriously! Perfect crust perfect sauce perfectly cooked...what?!?! Yes the price is higher than your big box pizza chains but this is the REAL thing! So when you want to go after your cheat meal or comfort food...RIGHT HERE YOU GO!!! And if you want to keep it clean ...the salad was chopped with the right amount of lettuce to ingredient ratio. What more can you ask for?!? No preservatives on that lettuce either...I'm IN!!!  To top it off...as a single mom brand new to the state of Nevada...Paul (owner) was so welcoming, kind and just an all around great person. We will continue to come back and I cannot wait to taste EVERYTHING on his menu!!! Thank you for such a great authentic amazing pizza and best service ever!!!",

We also ordered a large pizza, half Margherita, half Hawaiian. The garlic knots were delicious, and came with plenty of marinara sauce for dipping. The pizza was really good too! Thin crust, with toppings covering the pizza to all the way to the edge.   We were really happy with our experience here. The restaurant and restrooms were clean.

We ordered the fried zucchini, garlic knots and Cesar salad as appetizers.  Everything was great but oh those garlic knots... buttery, warm, garlicky goodness!!  The chicken and eggplant parmigiana were delicious!  The meat lovers pizza was great with a light crust and a perfect balance of meat and sauce.  We went crazy and ordered dessert also and wow!  The Zeppolis.... warm dough balls rolled in powdered sugar dipped in your choice of warm white choc. or raspberry sauce... heaven!  Treat yourself and save room for these bites of deliciousness.  The best part of the night by far was our server Brandon.  Oh my gosh.... so friendly, funny and receptive to our requests.  If I had a business, I would hire him in a minute!  I look forward to coming back on my next visit!",

    "text": "Oh man did this place satisfy my PIZZA cravings beyond expectation!  Biaggios is located off of Fort Apache & Flamingo in a little strip mall. A diamond in the rough for sure!   We arrived on a Sunday evening for an early family dinner before some entertainment at Dave N Busters. We normally dine at Dave N Busters but was wanting some good ol' pizza instead. A large party was just leaving as we arrived and we were greeted right away by the nice gentleman cleaning up. He said have a seat anywhere so we did. The football game was on so it was perfect timing.   The menu has your good ol pizza options as well as some appetizers, sandwiches, salads and entree choices. We scanned the menu and asked for some suggestions from the gentleman and we ultimately decided on Fried Zucchini 5/5 and wings 5/5 for appetizer, ceasar salad 5/5 and a Large half half choice with Meat lovers and Art of Chicken pizza 10/5! Is that even possible???? Oh well..... it was that good!!!  The large pizza was approx 16' in size with 8 huge slices!!!! Good thing we didn't order the XL, we still ended up packing up a box with 3 slices left. The Meat lovers had pepperoni, sausage, salami and meatball on it while the Art of chicken had chicken, artichokes, roasted tomato, black olives and garlic. Both options were THE BOMB!  Overall we were super pleased, stuffed and completely satisfied with our selections and meal especially my 5 yr old! We will definitely be back for more! Way better then pizza hut or little caesars! Go get some y'all!!!",

Everything was so DELICIOUS! We literally couldn't wait to eat it and ended up having a portion of the meal in the restaurant - the owner is super friendly and took care of us. Great food, very clean, and a very nice owner - I will definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas and will be recommending it to my friends! I can't wait to try their pizza / salad and zeppoli next time! Do yourself a favor and check this place out - you won't be disappointed!",

They're thinner slices which I love! Great fresh ingredients on top to make the taste of the pizza great.

We each ordered the lunch special (2slices and a drink) since we didn't want to have leftovers so we were out and about for the day. We each got to pick what we wanted for a topping on each slice and we had everything from white pizza, plain cheese, pepperoni and meatball. The meatball was mine and it did not disappoint, in fact, it was fantastic! I was already full since we also shared two orders of hot garlic knots dripping in butter before hand I could not finish both slices. The crust, the sauce, the flavor....it's delicious. Pass on the chains and get something a thousand times better at Biaggio's!  The service was excellent and the pizza came out fast and piping hot.

    "text": "Alright, Biaggio, here's your 5-star review. You said if my experience wasn't five stars, you'd make it five stars, but don't worry--the fact that every person in my family, all of which are particular about everything, especially food, can agree that you have the best pizza in Vegas has earned you all five stars.  I'm a pizza person. As soon as I took my first bite of real New York pizza in Times Square, I was hooked forever and ever and I will eat pizza any day, any time, any occasion, any place. So, you can imagine my withdrawals as I slowly realized that all of the pizza menus were disappearing from the menu stash in my family's pantry--too high of a delivery fee, too greasy, too much broccoli, hard crust--and being replaced with frozen pizzas. FROZEN PIZZA? That's the last resort, not the first! Something had to change.  I had just gotten back from Pittsburgh and it was my birthday. Traditionally, we go out to eat for birthdays, but it was rainy and I was sad that my team lost to the stupid Rangers and I just wanted to stay home and eat pizza and birthday cake. We drove up to Biaggio's based on Yelp reviews and the availability of garlic knots.   As soon as Mom and I stepped in the door, we were greeted by Biaggio. \"Are you dining with us?\" No, we just want to go home and eat pizza and watch rain fall on our rock backyard. We then had a long chat about which pizzas to get and ended up ordering off the menu--very VIP--and got a \"north end\" pizza, which is like margherita, but better. It has basil. While Mom and I waited, Biaggio stopped and asked if either us were vegetarians. He brought out a meatball drenched in sauce and a few slices of freshly baked bread, ready for dipping in his signature salt-less, sugar-less and super flavorful tomato sauce. IT IS DELICIOUS. May I have some more, please, sir?  The most impressive part was Biaggio's service guarantee; he really wanted that five-star Yelp review, and he was willing to do whatever he needed to to get it. Okay, we'll see. Where do you deliver? \"Anywhere in the valley.\" ...ANYWHERE!?  The pizza's excellent. The garlic knots are great (I still prefer Metro Pizza's garlic-drenched rolls, but these are perfect for anyone who prefers not to smell like garlic all day.) The service is superior. I don't know how to end this review, so I'm going to go get some more leftover pizza out of the fridge instead.",

It was delivered within 35 minutes to our house.  (-1 star: $3 delivery fee.)  The crust was a perfect combo of chewy and sturdy and yummy.  The sauce isn't too acidic (my husband gets acid reflux like crazy) and it didn't affect him at all.  We will order from here again, b/c they deliver good quality pizza.  Now excuse me while I go inhale another piece of pizza...  -UPDATE: So I just updated this because after eating the pizza, you feel ok.  Then about 30 minutes later you realize you just ate the greasiest pizza ever and and you want to hurl.  I'll pass next time if someone wants me to eat Biaggio's pizza.",

    "text": "A Meatball Sandwich to rule all others!  When I walked in to Biaggios to pick up my order last night, a family was sitting down, enjoying their pizza in the quaint dining area.  A man from the table greeted me, asked if I called in for an order, and stood up to introduce himself.  \"Hey, thanks so much, let's have a look,\" he said as he walked up to the counter with me.  He shook my hand and introduced himself as Biaggio, the owner.  He called to the kitchen to have my order brought up.  He handed me his card and said to call his cell phone if anything wasn't perfect and he would make it so.  We looked at the pizza together to make sure it was up to his standards, which it was!  His daughter was behind the counter helping package up my order.  It felt warm and fuzzy to be surrounded by a True family-run restaurant.  Cheese Pizza -   The NY style, big thin slices of pizza were just like you'd find on the streets of Brooklyn; perfect for folding.  It was cooked masterfully, with just the right amount of crisp.  The crust was warm, inviting, and pleasant much like Biaggio and his family.  My girlfriend loved the pizza, and had no second thoughts.  My only complaint was that I detected a predominant fontina flavor in the cheese, and I'm not a lover of fontina.  It isn't a bad thing, just a personal preference.  The Meatball Sandwich -   AMAZING.  The meatballs were tender, flavorful, and rested perfectly on the fresh baked bread without making it soggy. The marinara sauce was rich and comforting, with the most subtle hint of sweetness.  A heaping blanket of melted mozzarella naps across the sandwhich, flirting with your eyes as you pick it up.  It really is the best meatball sandwich in town, no debate.  Bottom Line:  Good Pizza, GREAT Meatball sandwich, and a warm family running the show makes Biaggios a MUST.",

Crust was chewy and crispy, it was done right. With all that meat the pizza can get greasy but that's on us not the restaurant.   -Garlic knots: you gotta get this! Knots are in garlic butter with Parmesan on top. I have had it elsewhere and this is the best!  -Bucket of Wings: 40 for 20 bucks, that is a steal and these wings are worth it, nice crunch and subtle spices with sides of Franks red hot, the only way to make real wings.  -Fried mushrooms: I am not a fan of friend mushrooms but people in my group are and they loved it, it was done well.  The prices are competitive, ingredients are quality, service was spot on.    My wife wants to add that they don't' have cannolis...  but I think she will live...

She was excited for me to stop by and try a few dishes. This was the perfect opportunity to do so!  After chatting with Biaggio for a few minutes about his breakfast pizza, several types of pizzas were brought out along with chicken wings, a salad, a huge portion of baked ziti and some fried dough with cinnamon on top. The pizzas brought out were pepperoni, meat lovers, chicken & artichoke and a cheese pizza.  Biaggio mentioned several times that the crust was made to be healthy sans sugar and salt. This is really different and I hope it catches on with pizza makers. The crust did taste good until the last piece.  I tried the cheese, pepperoni, chicken & artichoke pizzas along with some salad, baked ziti, a set of chicken wings with homemade ranch dressing and finished it up with a few small pieces of fried dough covered in cinnamon.  After the Tweetup attendees finished with the pizzas, Biaggio announced it was his son's birthday, who also works at the pizzeria. Biaggio brought out a huge strawberry cake and shared it with everyone. The birthday was a fun surprise that hasn't happened to me at a Tweetup before.  Thanks to everyone at Biaggio's Pizzeria for hosting such a fun event and I even got to eat dinner with the owner and some other cool friends. Even though this pizzeria is many miles away from my home, I'll be back to enjoy pizzas again and again.",

I mean, we will go out of our way to get those delicious wings.  Some people like really wet, soggy wings.  Don't come here if that's what you want.  I like my wings EXACTLY how Biaggio's makes them: smaller and crispy, soft inside, great sauce.  They know how to do it perfectly.  Every time.    The pizza is pretty good too.  They have great sauce and cheese.  The garlic knots are amazing.    I'm giving 5 stars based on everything overall, including service.  Biaggio himself is always there.  He's very involved with the food that goes out.  He's always upbeat and personable, which goes a long way in my book.  My husband and I have been going to his restaurant for a long time now.    It's definitely worth your time to go there.  Great service and food!",

    "text": "We ate here due to the Yelp reviews.  Excellent experience.  First off, they deliver anywhere in the valley, which will be very nice for us in the northwest.  We ordered an antipasto salad, a supreme large pizza, and an order of garlic knots, and 2 large sodas, which totalled $37.  Excellent price compared to most other independant pizza chains, some of which charge $37 for a large pizza alone almost.  We ate inside, which was available because someone had just finished, but otherwise it was full.  The pizza was very good.  The crust was thick enough to have some chew to it, but still thin.  The ingrediants definitely had a fresh taste to them.  The sausage is home made and very tasty, and the cheese is good.  The cheese does not have a cheap, low budget taste and feel to it.  The pizza had a healthy dosage of toppings as well, with nothing being skimped on, and everything was well balanced.  Our salad was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The antipasto came with a standard assortment of meats, cheese, peppers and such.  It came out in a plastic container, as if it was prepared for delivery.  The lettuce was standard chopped iceberg.  Overall the salad was ok, but not great.  The garlic knots were excellent.  Buttery and garlicky, and thick and chewy.  They were a good size and well priced.  Quite tasty.    The owner, Biaggio, as many others have mentioned, was onsite and quite concerned to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal.  The man cares about his food and cares that you like your meal.  He was actively involved in keeping the place clean and spent time talking to all the clients.  He talked with us about his menu a bit, and the restaurant, and asked how we liked each item.  Fortunately for me, after I inquired about the delicious looking cannolis, he treated me to one.  The cannoli was delicious.  The filling was excellent, and had a perfect blend of ricotta and moscarpone, with chocolate chips.  The staff was all friendly as well.  The service overall was top notch.    Overall, I give Biaggio's 5 stars for top notch service, an awesome delivery radius, excellent food, and great prices.  I cannot say it was the best meal I ever had, but overall, it was solid through and through.  When I want pizza again, as long as it is before 9pm (or 10 on Fri/Sat), Biaggios will be delivering.  Also, per Biaggio, if it isn't \"hot and fresh when it arrives, you won't pay for it either.\"  If the food here wasn't great and well priced, that kind of service would still count for a lot in my book.  I guess the fact that it has excellent quality and price as well are just bonuses.",

As they have a gluten-free pie crust (which is to DIE FOR it's sooo delicious) and gluten-free salads too. They will also remove meat items from any pizza to create a veggie option, including removing the cheese for vegans! Talk about customized pizza. And the portions are great big sizes and some items are family recipes...so they're homemade and incredible. And the owner, Biaggio, is just delightful! Spent most of our dinner chattin' it up with him while we were there. :)  I hightly recommend this pizza place. Really one of the best I've found in Vegas. Thanks for the amazing dinner last night!",

I can't explain what makes it so much more delightful than pizza or a calzone but it just is. I have enjoyed the meat lovers 3 times now and impressed others by serving it. One is around $18 and serves 3 - 4 people. Can't beat that!   Biaggios is a cute hole in the wall with around 10 tables. You could dine in if you wanted. The owner is ultra friendly and I've always had excellent service.    Do yourself a favor and try something way better than other pizza takeout.",

The ingredients were fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings, but the pizza sauce was lacking a bit of flavor and the crust could have been a tat more crispy.  However, the pizza here is better than others in the area.  Kind of sad to say since this place is a pizzeria, but I enjoyed the wings more than the pizza.  The wings were cooked to perfection and were mm mm good.  Overall it was a good dinner.  Would have been better if Boston won but at least I had pizza and wings to console me.",

Elegant, intricate yet classic flavors. Friendly, impeccable service.   Garlic knots: Sweet, large,  buttery, garlic not overpowering. Served with great marinara, not some tomato sauce affair.  Greek Salad: perfect vinaigrette, feta that was like it was flown in today, crisp, impeccable.  Italian Sub: usually not my cup of tea. I guess I never had a good one before! The wife ordered it, and I almost stole it from her! Unbelievably well dressed and loaded.  The Pizza: Oh, the pizza. HOMEMADE meatball slices. Dough that was the soul of perfection. Not salted to heck and gone  to make you drink more soda. Perfect compliment of flavors.   Zeppole: Never had it before. OMG. The same delicate pizza dough fried, the blanketed in powdered sugar, served with berry dip, then a custard dip. (Did in order as instructed.) Like the best powdered doughnut you've ever had in your life, only fresh and warm. If you hadn't of told me they were fried, I would not have ever guessed that.   Overall, I can totally see why so highly reviewed. We will be back, again and again!  A total value!!! You'll find cheaper. But you'll not find better.",

The first time I experienced this place I had a shmorgishborg (not leftovers) of food ranging from salad to specialty pizzas.. It might of been of mind over tastebuds that night because I was delighted with just about everything offered. Now with that said, I've come to visit  recently..  16\" Meatball pizza: The pizza wasn't as appealing as the first time?.. Thinly sliced meatballs were decent. On the other hand, the dough/crust was on the dry side, very little sauce didn't help, and quite tasteless in fact. The cheese was fine, It wasn't greasy, which I appreciate but a little grease would of helped this pie out. What happened?..  Chicken Wings (mild): These were Great, just like the first time. Crisp skin, juicy inside and had a one of a kind flavor! Went with ranch this time but I remember the bleu cheese was good as well. I couldn't be more pleased But still didn't make up for the pizza.  Overall, the pizza was disappointing this time around. I liked the chicken wings and that I can vouch for. Service friendly and accomodating, place was clean and had a typical pizzeria feel. I didn't feel I got my moneys worth here -  This pizza with one topping ($15.75), chicken wings 10 pieces with one ranch dip ($7.50) and 2 medium fountain sodas ($1.89 x 2 = $3.78) Total = $27.03 (Not including tax and tip). Too many other places around serving better consisent pies to make a repeat visit (maybe for the chicken wings).",

    "text": "I grew up in NY and I grew up eating pizza. Stellar pizza, excellent pizza, average pizza, meh pizza, substandard pizza, and downright crappy pizza.  In my many years I've never had pizza quite like the offerings from Biaggio's. We ordered two pies after a long day where neither of us wanted to cook. With happy thoughts of the five star reviews dancing in my head my husband called in the order.   With bated breath I awaited the moment when I would have a plateful of NY-style pizza. For $40. what we got was under-cooked, gooey dough with sauce that tasted like it came out of a cafeteria-sized vat. The cheese to sauce ratio was overwhelming, the sausage on my husband's pizza tasted like overcooked, chewy, slightly burnt, and gummy leather.   The zeppoles came with a white dipping sauce that smelled and tasted like suntan lotion.  I'm Italian and a baker, so my solution is to make my own crust, my own sauce, and make a bunch of pizzas to freeze, so they're ready heat up with fresh mozzarella and basil when the mood strikes. Biaggio's does not rate a second chance with us.   To summarize - if you have a fetish for institutional grade sauce, under-cooked pizza dough, with burnt toppings Biaggio's is definitely for you.  *** 8-20-15 - editing to add that after calling the establishment about the rawness of the dough we were informed that the dough arrives \"frozen\" so it must have been cooked though.  Biaggio's claims on their homepage that \"Biaggio's uses only the freshest, high quality ingredients. Because our ingredients are so fresh...\"   Frozen ingredients being passed off as fresh is a reprehensible act by this pizzeria, not to mention a blatant lie.",

We got 2 medium pizzas (cheese with onion and extra cheese and a supreme). We got our pizza delivered so it wasn't as crispy as I was hoping it would be but that is no one's fault in particular. And it took them a little under an hour to get it to the house. The price of the pizza is a little higher than what I am used to paying but it is supposedly hand tossed and it tasted good so, it was worth it. The crust was really good, just slightly crispy on the outside and the marinara was very nicely seasoned. The ingredients used don't taste cheap at all. It isn't the BEST pizza I've had in town but certainly better than a majority of the competition.",

Once we arrived to Biaggio's Pizzaria, we were welcomed with open arms as if we were family by Mr. Biaggio himself. Mr. Biaggio is one of the nicest restaurant owners you'll ever meet in your life and is not happy until his customers are satisfied and in my opinion, all restaurant owners should strive to follow in his footsteps.    I ordered 2 slices of pizza and a large soda for $6 which is the BEST deal in town. The sausage was very flavorful and the pizza was awesome overall, especially for the price.   I also tried the meatball and 'gravy' and that was probably the best meatballs I've had in my life, and I'm pretty picky with meatballs. The meatballs were so good, that I had to inquire details since they were so phenomenal. Mr. Biaggio informed us that the meatball and sauce is a family recipe and the bread is cooked fresh daily. So if you're going to Biaggio's, you MUST order a meatball sub if not on your first visit, then definitely your second.  5 stars all around, Biaggio's just gained some regular customers!.",

I placed a carryout order for a medium cheese pizza and a garden salad w/ ranch. Easy order, fine way to test the waters, and even if it's bad, it's good.  It took them longer than stated on the phone, no big deal, I waited for about 5 minutes in the restaurant. Biaggio introduced himself to me. Nice guy.  I get home, and the $5.50 garden salad was *tiny*. I think they incorrectly gave me a side salad. I called, spoke to Biaggio's son John, he asked what they could do to correct it and I told him it was not a probleml, I just wanted them to know. He was very polite and told me that the next meal was on the house.   Now, the food: The salad was fine. No complaints about quality. The pizza was fine too. It's hard to be objective about pizza. I didn't prefer their pizza, as I like a thinner crust and crispier texture. But there was nothing \"wrong\" with it. The flavor was good, and the blend of cheeses was nice as well.   I would advise others to try it. You can't beat the price, and the customer services was above average for Las Vegas. Pizza preference is subjective, so I can certainly see why so many others rave about Biaggio's.",

It was thin, crispy but not burnt, and completely cooked. The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back.  The only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me. Also, I wasnt the biggest fan of the decor, i dont think that the oversized pictures of food fit this place very well.

Between the wings, the pizza, the zeppolis .....you couldnt be happier being stuffed with good food.  5 stars EASILY.",

    "text": "At last, the vicious cycle of pizza belly has been ended by a gentleman by the name of Biaggio who is crankin' out \"to die for\" pies with fresh ingredients and quality cheese. Okay, so \"to die for\" are his words, but the za here is full of love and tastiness. Talk to Biaggio, and he explains that the ingredients in the pizza do not include sugar or salt, which may explain why my belly doesn't freak out after some slices here. Quite the opposite, my belly cries, \"More, more, more!\" Last night, we went with spinach, mushroom and garlic, and the ingredients were all fresh, distributed nicely, and somehow did not leak water all over the pizza. The crust was crisp all the way to the center.    As for the crust, it isn't sweet or salty, but the texture is the just right combination of chewy and crispy, and even more impressive, when you do the oven reheat the following day, the crust is just as spectacular.   On a previous occasion, I had a chance to sample several more treats thanks to the generosity of Biaggio. Of the specialty pies, the chicken artichoke stands out, but if you are an absolute meat lover, the homemade sausage here has quite the ingredient list. Did I hear him correctly, veal? Sausage isn't really my thing, but I found myself making an exception for the breakfast pizza. What? Did I say breakfast pizza? Yes, and I think it could go toe to toe with your favorite breakfast burrito.   One other item worth noting, which isn't on the menu, is pastrami stromboli. Pastrami is another thing I generally do not eat, but this creative creation called to me and said, \"How can you not eat just one bite?\" I did with some pickles and mustard, and then I had to eat another bite. The ease of cutting a scrumptious bite, stabbing a pickle and dipping in some mustard made it hard to not keep shoveling it down!  Oh, and I didn't even mention the blue cheese dressing. If blue cheese is your condiment vice, be careful here. I think I order salad just so I have an excuse to stuff Maytag chunks in my mouth.   Pizza, sausage, cheese combined with a passionate business owner: not sure if it gets much better!",

    "text": "Just Awesome!    Went in here for the first time a couple of months ago.  Had the meatball sub.  I love the meatballs!!  Very tasty. While there the owner came by and asked if it was my first time here and I said yes, and then he gave me slice of pizza to try!  It was really good!  It is on the greasy side but that's what makes it taste so good.  I mean it wasn't overly or anything, just more taste than other pizza.  I don't know I loved it.  I also order out from time to time from this place.  The online ordering system is quite easy to use.  I don't beleive they give you a time of when they will deliver like some places but about 45 minutes sounds about right.  If they have any questions for you they will call you and ask.  I know one time I placed an order for meatball parm and I got the meatball sub and called it in and they made a return trip to give me the meatball parm :) that was very nice, I was more concerned that I received the wrong order!   Very nice...very good on service too.  I've had no problems with them that they didn't take care of me.  Also the prices are not bad, very affordable.  I love eatting their parm, it's like spagetti and meatball but with baked cheese on top that's nice and gooy yum!  Always fresh and hot when it gets delivered...If I feel like staying home and getting some pasta this is my go to place. :)",

Ordered the pizza extra crispy, but it arrived soggy with undercooked toppings - I think it would have been tasty if it hadn't been so soggy. We had Spagetti with Sausage and I think my hubby had Chicken Parmesan. Red sauce wasn't anything to write home about, not nearly as good as our old Italian home delivery spot from La Famiglia on Durango.  The search for our weekend italian delivery joint continues.",

You can tell it family owned & operated before you even walk in the door.  We even met the owner himself  The staff was extremely helpful, kind, accomodating. We started off with wings and buffalo sauce on the side since my friend is a pansy and he doesn't take too well to hot things. :D The wings were delicious by themselves. Nice and crispy yum. I was starting to get full... We also order two whole pizzas they came out. I forgot to tell you... THE PORTIONS ARE EFFING HUGE. I managed to get down two slices  Biaggio made sure to check up on us from time to time to see how we were doing.  We got a nice surprise and out came these little fried dough covered in sugar with fruit jelly and chocolate dipping sauce. They reminded me of beignets and were oh so utterly delicious.  I felt like I was going to fall into a food coma before the fried goodness came out but I couldn't stop putting them in my mouth. HAHAHAHHA  A+ in my book.",

Mozzarella sticks were chewy and delicious. The Meatlover pizza was good but a bit expensive for its quality.  The only thing I can't bear was the spaghetti sauce. It had weird taste and I couldn't explain how. It wasn't sweet and tasty. I'm not sure if it was original Italian spaghetti sauce but it wasn't good to me.  I think this restaurant is a bit overpriced for the pizzas. We ended up paying $80 for 1 medium pizza, 2 dishes of spaghetti, 1 fettuccine and 1 mozzarella stick dish. I will come back for the Fettuccine.",

    "text": "We ordered the Garlic knots, the antipasto salad, and an order of onion rings. The garlic knots, no exaggeration were in a pool of garlic oil about 1/4-1/2 inch deep. The onion rings were completely soggy, and not even cooked really. This I expect was due to them not taking enough time to let the deep fryer hit the proper temp, or they just pulled them out too early.   The salad was not at all like in the picture, and overall wasn't flavorful. The whole order was a huge disappointment because I had to set the onion rings and knots onto paper towels to drain some of the grease, then heat up the oven, and actually cook them to the point they weren't sopping with grease. There wasn't much we could do to improve the salad so we just ate it. Overall it was a solid 1 star except the delivery was pretty quick. There is also a very subtle $4 delivery fee believe it or not, which I thought was ridiculous and if they had told me that or given me a total on the phone I would have just canceled the order right then and there. Between tip and delivery fee and tax I paid almost 100% extra! Wow, not going back, and back off of the garlic oil that is just insane.",

So, when we got there it seemed odd that they weren't ready for us. Tables were dirty from the night before, tables and chairs for outdoor seating were stacked inside, etc. Odd, but no big deal.  We ordered garlic knots, drinks, and 2 breakfast pizzas (one veggie & one meat lovers). We were disappointed that \"breakfast\" doesn't include coffee, but whatever.  The breakfast pizzas were pretty delicious. The crust was thick and crispy with great flavor. The one with meat had generous amounts of ham, bacon, sausage, egg...it was fantastic. The veggie one had peppers, onions, spinach, tomato. Basically an amazing omelette pizza mash up.  The breakfast pizzas are only available on Fri & Sat 10-11a. You should definitely make an effort to check them out!!",

It didn't even have a garlic taste to it. I had to dip it in garlic powder. Also, texture is way too soft and pillow-y. You know garlic knots are amazing if you breathe on someone after you eat it, and it offends them  CHICKEN WINGS 5/5 I liked these a lot. Perfect crunchy texture, flavor was great. Nice touch that they included hot sauce with the wings (tastes like Frank's Red Hot, my favorite)  OTHER SAUCES 0/5 Marinara sauce for garlic knots: Bland and flavorless Bleu Cheese for Chicken wings: it looked watered down, and looked really weird.  SERVICE 5/5 I called for pick up, and the woman on the phone was friendly. When we went to pick it up, she gave me some oregano and garlic powder to go.  TOTAL ~ 3/5  I'm on the fence of whether or not I'd come here again. I need to try other pizza places first. I would def come back for the wings if nothing else.",

He said the owner would be in touch with me, but I haven't heard a peep.",

    "text": "Two stars because I could have just saved 11$ by going down and picking up my food from them. They aren't even a whole mile away and there's a delivery charge? Never again even though the food was decent. Didn't even tell me on the phone there was going to be a delivery charge. Then the driver wouldn't let me keep   Changing it to one star now because I got a great comment from from the place about how \"EVERY pizza place has a delivery charge and it goes to driver and I'm a cheap ass\" No, no, every place does not have a delivery charge. Especially a 5$ charge for less than a mile. And the driver told me he does NOT get the charge for himself which is why I tipped him 6.58$ on top of the delivery charge. So if you say he is getting more than a 20% tip for not even restaurant sit down service, and acquired it through means of manipulation then o am correct in my assessment of not patronizing this place in the future. Who the hell wants to pay 45$ for a pizza and cheap sandwich?",

    "text": "I've been a customer of Biaggio's for a few years but sadly I will no longer be doing business with them. When I first found Biaggio's, they really had the best pizzas in the SW Vegas area. The pizzas were delicious and you could tell that they were made with good ingredients. They were also reasonably priced. What made this place even more convenient was that you could order online instead waiting on hold (this place would get busy during meal times). However, in the last year or so the quality has declined. The pizzas were still decent but almost every time I would order there would be mistakes. Regardless if the order was placed over the phone or online, some how some way the order would end up being incorrect and my wife and I would have to wait 30+ minutes for the correct order to be delivered (anyone who has been in this situation can attest to how frustrating this can be especially when you are hungry). At first they used to provide gift certificates and Mr. Biaggio himself would deliver the correct order with a sincere apology but this doesn't happen anymore. The drivers deliver the corrected order and hardly seem apologetic or sympathetic. This place has really declined over the last couple of years and it is saddening because I really used to enjoy their food. Hopefully they can turn things around before more people follow suit and bring their business elsewhere.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to have dinner at Biaggio's Pizzeria on 2/16/11 while on vacay thanks to the helpful advice of other Yelpers. This place is AWESOME!!! Everything about this restaurant is 5+++++++ Stars! From the exceptional front line service of Mr Biaggio and his daughter all the way down to the ingredients that he uses, you can tell Mr Biaggio takes his restaurant seriously. We really enjoyed being able to meet and chat with Mr Biaggio himself! What a great guy to take the time to get to know and meet his customers! Between the two of us, we ordered the garlic knots, chicken parm sub, and a small supreme pizza. There are no words that can express how delicious the food is here. All I can say is that you must visit Biaggio's Pizzeria when you're in the area to understand exactly what I mean. You can most certainly feel and taste the love and pride that goes into all of the food made here. The ingredients that he uses are of fine dining quality and his recipes are authentic. I will now review the 3 items that we ate.   Garlic knots:   To die for!!! These garlic bread knots have the perfect crusty outside with a soft and chewy middle. The garlic knots are complemented with a marinara sauce that is perfect in consistency, texture, and flavor. We were shocked when Mr Biaggio told us that he does not use salt in his marinara sauce. The medley of spices and herbs that he uses in his sauce make up for the absence of salt. The garlic knots are buttery with the perfect amount of garlic used. He also uses real shredded Parmesan cheese to top the garlic knots and not the cheap, powdery stuff that comes out of a can.   Chicken parm sub:   The bread used for this sandwich is fabulous! Mr Biaggio told us that the bread he uses for his sandwiches are made by an older Italian gentleman who has been making bread for years! One bite into the bread and you can taste the years of experience that went into making the bread. The crust is perfectly crusty with a soft and chewy middle. The taste is perfect. You can tell that the bread maker is a master of his craft. The chicken inside the sub is plentiful and has a perfect balance of seasoning. Once thing that we noticed about his chicken parm sandwich that is different from others is that he cuts up the chicken into bite size pieces which makes eating this sandwich easy and quite pleasurable. And of course, as I mentioned above, the marinara sauce used in this sandwich was perfect and complemented the sandwich well.   Small supreme pizza:   Small!!? This pizza was quite large for a \"small size\". The toppings he used were plentiful and of superb quality. The amount of sauce and cheese used was perfect. The pizza's crust was quite tasty and enjoyable all the way to the crust. There is a perfect balance of the amount of toppings and sauce that he uses because the pizza was not a soggy mess like some other pizza's that flop and sag. Our pizza was quite enjoyable down to the last bite!   In summary, Mr Biaggio and his daughter go out of their way to make you feel at home. Their warm and friendly disposition make you feel as if you are eating in their families home. The food here is amazing and very plentiful. The prices here are low and very affordable. The quality of the food is of fine dining caliber without the high prices and the recipes used here are authentic and perfected. Our whole experience here was a 5++++++ Star one and we will definitely be back next year for more. Would I recommend eating here? Are you kidding me? YES! YES! YES! You will not be disappointed! The only bad thing about eating at Biaggio's for us is that now since we do not live in Vegas, we'll have to wait a whole year till we can have more! Eating Italian food anywhere else will not be the same for us now that we know how Italian food is supposed to taste like thanks to Mr Biaggio! Mahalo(Thank you in Hawaiian) Mr Biaggio for an outstanding dining experience!",

I ordered a pizza 2 nights ago and was told it would about 45 min to arrive. 40 minutes later, I get a call asking if I had received my pizza yet. I had not. They apologized that the order was printed but was somehow overlooked by the cook. My rushed my pizza and it arrived less than 20 minutes later, and was FREE of charge. Basically, the pizza only took 15 minutes longer than I was originally expecting, but I didn't have to pay for it. Very few food establishments these days place such an emphasis on customer satisfaction. Good for you Biaggio and Jim.  I've ordered from here about dozen times, and they hardly ever screw up. When they do make a mistake, they DO make it right by the customer.",

The owner greeted my family & I as we walked in. He was super duper friendly & the place was so clean. I felt so comfortable being there. The owner & staff was so nice, I couldn't believe the how great the service was.  As soon as my son told him it was his birthday, he gave him a donut w/ a candle & also a donut for my other younger son. He brought out his staff to sing the Happy Birthday song to him. As we were waiting for our food to go, he let us try some delicious Italian cookies. Everything was so freak'n good! The pizza's, the meatballs, the chicken wings, the bread & the cookies. I love this place! For my opinion, I think they have the best chicken wings ever. Loved everything I ate here. Even though it's my first time being here, I thought that the owner gave us the best & friendliest pizzeria experience.",

    "text": "I'll admit that I'm a bit hard on pizzerias. This town is severely lacking and when one stands up above average I will acknowledge it. This place is above the average Las Vegas pizzeria. The pie had a good flavor, the sauce is definitely better than most. The crust is very good as well. I've now ordered three times from this location. It has a lot of potential. There are things I really liked and things I'm not crazy about.  First and most obvious problem is that they are closed on Sunday. Are you f*&cking kidding me?? It's a pizzeria, closed on a Sunday. That's blasphemy. Football, pizza, wings, and beer. That's the way it is meant to be. Ok so with that initial disappointment aside let's move on.  If you want legit reviews, ignore the 5 star ones. They are bought and paid for because the owner will do whatever to get 5 star reviews. I'm not saying he actually gives money for em, but he will give away food and gift cards like it's water if he knows you're a Yelper. That doesn't really sit well with me. I thought I was alone till I read the other real reviews here. The pizza was good one out of the thee times I ordered (only after my bad review), and definitely in no way is a 5 star product. Don't be whores Yelpers!!   The first time I ordered everything was pretty good. The pie was a little undercooked for my taste but everything was ok. The second time was just awful. My pizza was very undercooked and the cheese was running everywhere, the calzone was also undercooked as in nearly raw.  So the third time I ordered everything was near perfect. I ordered a Sicilian and Garlic Knots. The Garlic Knots were similar to New York. It brought me back home the whole time I was devouring them. The Sicilian was definitely one of the best I've had in town. It was tasty and thick (refrain from the That's what she said for a moment.) It was also soft and had the perfect chewiness to it. It's a rectangle cut into 8 squares. In New York you usually get a square pizza that takes up an entire 16\" box but here it is common to find them in this 8 slice rectangle. Which is fine, but I absolutely love the giant square style because you get those awesome center pieces which has no crust and is just cheesy goodness on every side. Just be prepared that you will probably have a longer wait if you order a Sicilian. The first time I tried to order I was told the wait was at least two hours (WTF?) and I was starving, so I ordered a regular pie. The next time I prepared myself and ordered early, it was delivered in an hour and a half which was very bearable considering I was expecting two hours.  Now they are pricey, but if the food is as good as the last time I ordered it, then it isn't too bad. After a few bumps along the way I could see this place having potential. They just need to work on their consistency. It's holding me back from being a regular here.",

    "text": "Finally checked out Biaggio's Pizzeria when Sno Ono had their last day event.  They were so awesome in partnering with them and giving out free slices as a result!    What makes them really special is that the Little Guy normally does not eat pizza.  Trust me, we've been trying and pushing and he usually just eats the olives off the pizza.  But for some reason, he saw us eating their cheesy slice and wanted some.  We obliged and he asked for more!  Unheard of!  What's even more amusing is that the Husband had pizza twice earlier that week and was pizza-ed out!  He rolled his eyes when he heard free pizza.  But then again, he had a slice of their pepperoni and went back for a few more!  I take that as a pretty good sign he was loving their version.  The staff are great - friendly and were constantly cleaning!  They wiped down the tables and swept after each guest!  When do you ever see that happen at any restaurant these days?",

    "text": "Updated my original review from 2 stars to 3 stars.  The reason being is that I probably dried out the pizza by putting it in my oven for an additional 5 minutes to make the crust crispier.  So that's probably my fault the pizza turned out dry.  I had the white pizza and added chicken.  There wasn't much sauce so the pizza dried out and skimpy on the chicken.  I've ordered here more than once and the toppings on other pizzas weren't very generous compared to the price of the pizza.  Crust is also too soft and flimsy for me.  Sorry, but this is just my honest opinion.",

The delivery arrived quickly after ordering, so I have to assume the ziti was packed up cold and sent out that way. It would seem the food was not made to order but rather was sitting around under a heat lamp hoping to be ordered. Definitely will not eat here again, there are better pizza options out there for the price.",

    "text": "EXCELLENT FOOD! We ordered online for dinner for 6. Italian Sub, GF Chicken Parm (with no cheese), 12\" cheese pizza and a side salad. There were no descriptions on the online order form so I went with what I know; and how I make Gf items. I figured the gluten free chicken parm would be breaded in gluten free bread crumbs. I asked for no cheese. I also thought a gf spaghetti or other pasta would be served. I was surprised to open and find that this was a grilled chicken breast, still covered in cheese, and served with cheese ravioli. Disappointed and concerned that my 3 year old would be unable to eat. My friend called and Biaggo said he would make us new food.  I was really impressed with the level of service we received. They replaced the parm with a gf pizza, free of charge, offered to deliver (we declined but appreciated the offer), and they gave my husband 2 slices of cheese cake to go. Every single thing we ate was delicious. I honestly cannot say when the last time I ate gluten free pizza that didn't taste like cardboard was. This was amazing. The sauce is delicious. The Italian dressing on the side salad was better than anything we've ever had. Every bite was eaten without a crumb left. You've gained customers for life. We are amazed by your service and love your food.  Thank you!",

    "text": "This is our 4th time ordering pizza at Biaggio's. The first 2 times were quite good and I would've definitely recommended them to our friends & family. The owner was friendly and was very welcoming on both occasions. The 3rd and now our 4th time ordering and I'd be hard pressed to go back or recommend them to anyone.  This time we ordered a pizza with mushrooms & ricotta cheese. When I arrived to pick it up I looked at the pizza and voiced my concern that the lack of mushrooms was disappointing and the same thing had happened previously on our 3rd order. The guy at the counter said \"I'll write it down\" as if that was going to take care of anything with the immediate situation. I was rather puzzled by his response but didn't feel like arguing with him about what good customer service was and how he should've handled the situation.  After arriving home from a quick 5 minute drive we found our pizza to be an undercooked cheesy swamp and as noted before a distinct lack of mushrooms. The pizza was impossible to eat in any normal sense of the word and wouldn't even stand up to the folded NY style of eating a slice. I've attached 2 pictures, bad iPhone shots, showing our pizza and what it looked like prior to and after trying to remove a slice after using a knife to re-cut it.  We were very disappointed as we really liked the flavor of their sauce and the ingredients. Even though it's priced quite high for pizza we would've been regular customers but if you can't get the order right, or cooked properly, I'll spend my money elsewhere.",

You can taste the differences between their quality ingredients and other pizzas.  There's other thing that made the meal great was the owner.

He asked Mr. Biaggio, and Mr. Biaggio actually let us sample a big meatball w/slices of fresh baguette.  We enjoyed that meatball very much.

I recommend this place to anyone who likes great pizza and fabulous meatballs.",

The owner comped my entire meal for the inconvenience, due to the wait plus gave a gift certificate for the future.  To say this was way beyond in service is an understatement.   The food is very very good, I've eaten here a few times and will many more times in the future.  Wings are crispy, knots are huge with the right balnce of garlic and butter.  I've had the meat lover's pizza a couple of times and you can't go wrong.  Crust is good, plenty of meat and the cheese is very tasty.  As many have stated the owner is a really nice guy and class act.   He genuinely seems to care and wants to make the best food possible and please the customer.   Prices are very competitive, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",

I usually don't like meat ball subs, but this was almost to die for. The ingredients are high quality and on the healthier side than other pizza places.   The hospitality and service is awesome as well. You're treated just like family. The pricing is cheap! Where else can you find food of this caliber for this deal. He even delivers all over town. Find another pizza place to do that for you. If you haven't been before, I'd highly recommend going.   A lot of Mr. Biaggio's foods are family recipes. They are great! Try them yourself. I don't think you can go wrong. Even if you do, he will take care of you.  Check it out :)",

    "text": "I have never been treated so badly by a restaurant. I take back my previous statement that the owner is friendly. Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that \"wasn't the service\" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, \"We're out.\" He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again.   You don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to \"The customer is always right?\" When did it become \"The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?\"  All he had to do when I came in was say, \"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better,\" and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back. Not with an owner that treats customers that way.",

    "text": "This place is now our family favorite!  When I asked my husband and daughter where we should go for our Valentine's celebration, they both immediately replied Biaggio's!  We went last night and as always, the place feels like home the moment you walk in the door!  You just don't find this level of comfort in a restaurant anymore...especially in Las Vegas!!!    The food was fantastic as always!  We started with a Greek Salad.  The dressing was delicious and the feta...ooohhh the feta!!!  It was just the right texture and taste!  I would be tempted to go back and order just a bowl of feta if everything else wasn't so divine!!  What a difference QUALITY ingredients make!  We ordered our other favs- garlic knots and cheese/ pepperoni pizza.  YUMMMMM as always!!!!  On a side note, the Parmesan sprinkled on the garlic knots is so delicious that I am always tempted to lick plate afterward.  Restraint is definitely needed!!  But one day if you are in there and you see a woman licking her plate...you will know why!!  We now come on a regular basis even though the restaurant isn't exactly right around the corner for us.  But the drive from North Las Vegas to here is always worth it.  We have never left disappointed or unsatisfied.    As if the service in the restaurant isn't impressive enough, my husband ordered several pizzas and wings for his workplace a few weekends ago.  They delivered clear across town and it arrived piping hot!!!!!  They were all impressed with the prompt service and, of course, their delicious feast!  If by chance my reviews didn't convey this, please know that I highly recommend this place!!!!!!!  We came upon it by chance and we keep going back because of the superior eats, the excellent service and the comfortable environment.  Without a doubt, this is the BEST pizza.  And as someone who grew up on the east coast and practically started eating pizza on my way out the womb, that is the highest compliment I can give.",

    "text": "Now being a foodie, great food means a lot to me.  Pizza just happens to be one of my favorite food.  The only reason why I'm giving this a 4 star is because there are 2 other pizzas that I feel that are better than Biaggio's.  One is in the Philippines called Sam's Pizza, and the other is, believe it or not, is Numero Uno's \"The Works.\"  But other than those 2, so far, Biaagio's is 3rd on my list.  So every time I do a Vegas trip with the fellas, we always take the time to stop by Biaggio's for some great pizza.  Biaggio's uses fresh ingredients and a homemade recipe.  My first time in Biaggio's was a great experience.  I ordered a small pepperoni, but the owner surprised me with a large and said, \"don't worry about it, I'll charge you for a small, I just really want you guys to try our pizza.\"  I thought that was hella cool!  So the fellas and I shared my large pizza with a smile in our faces :)  Great service, and Mr. Biaggio himself is a really cool guy.",

All the toppings fell off my pizza when I tried to eat it. When I took my first bite I bit into something super hard. Yikes! Had to spit out that bite. Great flavor on the cheese and pepperoni though. To me the pizza needed to be baked longer and I did to give it a crisper crust but for myself I didn't want it. I also ordered wings and fried mushrooms. The wings were nice and crispy which was great and they came unsauced. I loved that I could sauce them myself so they never got soggy. The fried mushrooms had great flavor but for the price you don't get many. Overall 3/5 for me because of the pizza. I want more flavor in the crust and a more stable pizza. It was like a meh experience for me. The other things I ordered were great but I won't order the pizza again. But would try other food.",

It's a little thick for my taste, but nice chew and not too doughy.    Had a little hiccup with our order, but the owner was very gracious and handled the situation beautifully.

I was informed that the lady who took my order passed it along and the guy who took it from her set it aside, and that they were wall to wall cleaning so not taking any orders. The man apologized and offered a store credit, but we are not from here and were leaving the next morning. Not impressed since they had my contact information and could have called immediately to say there had been a mistake and they could not take any orders that night.",

What I can say now, before I update this review is:   We had so many more guests than I'd anticipated.  Many were paleo, vegetarian, and gluten free in diet.  Biaggio's covered all of us.  He simply charged a flat rate for my group size, and said: Mal, leave your worries to us. We understand the diversity of diet, and we've got you covered.  I was skeptical, but -- O M G did Biaggio deliver above and beyond.... Yes, he did.    For a flat catering rate, we received a greek salad, buffalo chicken wings, fried mushrooms and zucchinis, delicious gluten free pizzas, and delicious knotted pastries filled with cheese, marinara and the works!  Next DEFCON -- Biaggio, We'll see you in August.  I really hit the jackpot finding you in this wild and dusty desert.",

Mozzarella sticks pretty good as well. Prepare for a ridiculous delivery time as well. Took an hour and twenty minutes for pizza and mozzarella sticks to be delivered 8 mins away from their location. Food was room temperature by the time it arrived. 40 bucks for a room temperature large pizza and 6 cold mozzarella sticks. Not worth it. Let down and a big pass.",

The food is magnificent, the best quality ingredients and r wonderful collection of recipes. Everything you try is amazing, from the salads, which has a few different options and one is just as good as the next, to the zeppole. The pizza is made with the best ingredients possible and you can tell with the fist bite.My favorite is the veggie, I just love the way the garden vegetables melt together with the delicous cheese, a perfect pizza. My family love the meat lovers, which is really cool because my 8 years olds are picky. We have also had the wings and the garlic know, and I am ashamed to say our family fights for the last garlic knot and even more ashamed that I didn't win it.   This pizzeria is like going to someone's home. The owner makes you feel special and loved, just like if you were his family. He is a great man who is full of kindness and love. The service is perfection. I love that I can go there and trust that I will have no problem with my order, it will always be perfect. It is a place where my whole family loves, I mean seriously LOVES. IT is sometimes terribly hard to find a place we all agree on. Quality food us always important. Best quality of food I have ever had in the 13 years I have lived in Las Vegas.I cannot wait to fo back",

We order a medium I think it was about $16 and the extra large was $24 but the value was just so much more for the extra! The pizza is not greasy that's the #1 for me. A lot of flat dough pizzas the cheese gets too greasy and the pizza sort of falls apart but not Biaggio's! Plus the sauce makes it more special. Family owned business supports locals and I recommend dinning in because this pizza is so good fresh out of the oven is the way to go!",

A wonderful professional clean cut delivery man shows up at my door, with the pizza asked do you need cheese or peppers talks about my dog. Again WOW where am I.

He was a very genuine person, really knows his ingredients, and companies which ingredients come from. We were explaining to him how hard it has been to find good food here since moving from Sparks, Reno. Once we got our pizza it was absolutely as fresh as they come. We were starving so we hurried home. Hands down the best pepperoni pizza I have personally had. The cheese is the kind that pulls and snaps back at yah. The sauce is not to sweet, or acidic. It was perfect!!! Tons of cheese, and the perfect amount of sauce. (I did order extra sauce) Wings, were just as good, tons of meat and cooked perfect. You can tell they really care about the products they use. We will be back for sure!!",

Large pizza with half mushrooms & sausages and half with ham & pineapples.  To my surprise, my picky other half loved it, as did I.  For those of you living close by this place, I envy you.

    "text": "A recent workplace discussion regarding favorite calzone places in Vegas culminated today in the Calzone Contest.  I brought the Meat Lover's calzone and also the East Coast (a ricotta and mozzarella with garlic) both from Biaggio's.  My friend brought a meat calzone from Grimaldi's and was certain that she would be victorious.  With six self-proclaimed aficionados acting as judges, everyone ate at least one piece from each calzone.  At the end of the day five of the six people determined that Biaggio's was the best calzone they had ever eaten.  Mostly discussed were compliments regarding the crust and the ricotta cheese used, as well as the pepperoni and sausage.  My friend (after quickly conceding defeat) has even decided that Biaggio's will now be her favorite spot and can't wait to try other items on the menu.  Biaggio's has amazing food and top-notch customer service.  That's why I eat there.  I'm thrilled that I was able to introduce four new customers to my favorite pizza place.    Grazie!",

They were soft, buttery, and fluffy. People definitely need to try it if they at Biaggio's Pizzeria!! We ordered the White Pizza and added chicken.

We called and were told they had many gluten free options.  Being skeptical based on our experiences so fast,  we decided to take a chance.   It is located in a strip mall,  small and pleasingly intimate with outdoor seating.  As soon as we entered,  there were smiles all around.  We immediately felt welcomed and comfortable.   The menu is awesome,  and they had examples of their menu in a display case.  It looked incredibly delicious,  and smelled amazing. The staff went to great lengths to explain the gluten free options,  and even shared their own story of celiac disease and how it impacted their menu.   We ordered 3 pizzas,  all different and special,  including a gluten free pizza.  The food was  AMAZING!  Great flavor,  perfectly done and obviously made with care.  Most importantly,  my wife's pizza was incredible,  and it was good to see her smile as she ate.    After driving a ways to get there,  we decided it was soooo worth it,  and we will be making them our go to spot for Italian food.  The stromboli looked awesome,  so that will be my next order.  And guess what...THEY DELIVER!!  Even way out to my house!   We are most definitely fans and loyal customers from here on out.",

So one night we wanted to try something new and from the sounds of the reviews, this place was a \"Must Try\" and I have got to say, Yelpers could have never been so damn right!   Our Order:  1 SALAD, Dressings; Blue Cheese, Ranch, Italian. So I am not much of a Blue cheese fan but   1 SUPREME PIZZA. Ok so I'm a NY Style Pizza kinda gal as my husband is a Deep Dish kinda guy, hails from Chicago, but you would have never known that the night we came in! The sauce, as Biaggio says \"Is to die for!\" and it seriously is!   1 EGGPLANT PARMESAN   1 CANOLI. Never in Vegas have I found a place that does the Canoli RIGHT, til December 11, 2010. Creamy, yummy, make your eyes roll to the back your head--goodness!   I have been in Vegas close to 6 years now and I have not been able to find a quality pizza joint that I can speak so highly about. You can feel the love that Biaggio puts into his restaurant and food. You can taste the freshness, quality but above all, they really do know how to take care of you. You don't feel like a customer, ya start to feel that homely, family feeling that you rarely see these days.   Will we be back? DUH.",

My brother already told me they have the best pizza here in vegas. When i did my order imentioned that i wanted it to be delivered to the clubhouse since me and my other brother who is vacationing from the philippines will be at the pool. It was delivered very fast. Pizza was really really good. We ordered the white pizza with sausage. And one thing that really amazed me was that they also gave us paper plates coz i mentioned we'll be at the pool. I didnt request for it but they are thoughtful enough to give it. Excellent food. Excellent customer service! :)",

Delivery guy was friendly. In fact, technically he delivered to me after they closed. Impressive. The ingredients were like straight from the farmers market. There is genuinely zero reason to order from some generic Pizza Hut, dominoes, papa johns with a place like this in your neighborhood. Outstanding!",

    "text": "They are the best pizza place in the whole Las Vegas. This is my first time to post here since I only use Yelp to look for restaurants and just check a good place to go to. I'm a regular customer since I love their Pizza supreme. I've been going to them at least twice a month for the last 7 months. Everytime I order, the service is great and as usual the food is great too! Today, under some unusual circumstances, there was something wrong with my order. I somewhat got the wrong order and I was not able to check what I got before I left. When I got home, I got the wrong pizza.   I called them and was able to talk to John. He apologized and told me he'll deliver the food. But I hesitated and told him I will drive back. As soon as I got there, John gave me my order and apologized. And not just that, he said he voided the charge on my card earlier when I paid and also gave me a $25 dollar gift certificate. I told them they didn't have to. I was not even mad. I will always come back for their food! But they insisted. These guys are amazing! Not only they have the best food but they have the best interest on all their customers. When I went home, I couldn't believe how John (probably he's the owner) was really nice. No wonder all the great reviews here are consistent. By the way, order their chicken wings. It's the best too!",

When I pay more than $26 for a 6-piece margherita pizza pie (delivered), I expect it to be at least pretty good. With the reviews this place got, I was incredibly disappointed and really regret my purchase. The mozzerella taste was decent, the sauce was fresh and homemade tasting, but completely lacked salt and garlic. There was so much sauce and so little mozzerella (and tomatoes) that the sauce overpowered the mozzerella and gave the pizza a bland smushed tomato taste. There were like 10 pieces of basil on the whole pizza and they were also completely flavorless (probably not fresh because I grow basil and would use it on homemade margherita pizzas and can always always taste it). The crust of the pizza was tough and did not taste good at all. The pizza was delivered rather quickly but the pizza was cold when I got it. I had to heat up a couple slices for 45 seconds. I definitely do not recommend this place - save your money. Huge regret.",

We ordered the pineapple & ham slices, which were ok. I ordered the \"Art of Chicken\" which consisted of diced white meat chicken, artichokes, peppers, garlic and black olives. The picture shown in the restaurant was nothing close to what I got. The toppings were piled on after, on a sauceless cheese slice. I guess this is how they customize each plain slice. What bothered me the most was the smell of dirty dish rag that kept wafting from the pizza or was it the parmesan cheese shaker? It was hard to say. I didn't enjoy it at all, but luckily I did get a backup slice of cheese as my 2nd pick. The cheese slice was good, but swimming in a pool of grease. Be careful not to splash it on your clothing like I happened to do. I wish I enjoyed it more as the people in there were very nice and kept asking, \"was it delicious?\". I didn't have the heart to say \"no...\", so I just nodded. There is a certain smell of garlicky sauce, a hot pizza oven, etc. when you first walk into a really good pizza place that unfortunately Biaggio's lacked.",

But if I have my choice, it would be high end gourmet pizza (think, Grimadi's, Due Forni).   Overall, I found Biaggio's to be a little greasy for my taste, but the sauce had a great flavor and it is definitely cheaper than the high end pizza places I like to frequent.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and I was a fan of the crust.  Not too thick, not too thin.  Got a salad too but was nothing to write home about.  My man seemed to enjoy the food, so if you aren't worried about grease, Biaggio's is a great choice!",

After numerous trips to the nearby cosmoprof a few of us decided to finally check it out. we were greeted with nothing but smiles and treated like we were family. This being our first visit to Biaggio's he was more than ecstatic to give us samples of his outrageously delicious meatball sub and his incredible pizza. now normally i am not a fan of thinner pizza but this pizza was truly out of this world. it was cooked to perfection...a crunchy underside yet the cheese and toppings were just so juicy and they balanced out every nicely. if you plan on going here though i truly recommend the meatball sub! it is completely unlike anything you have ever tasted. the meatballs are made from beef, lamb, pork, parmesan and i think even a little love and magic. they were the most incredible things i have ever eaten. also their prices are very reasonable and  taking into consideration that they make EVERYTHING there from SCRATCH it was well worth the price. i definitely plan on going back for the fantastic food and also the wonderful and uplifting personality of mr.biaggio himself.",

Once entering I discovered it was small and had to really read the menu before deciding to order, while spending a good 5-10 minutes deciding I noticed a man standing in the corner waiting and waiting until he was approached by a man who just simply asked \"can i help you\" the man explained that he ordered a sandwich about 15 mins ago and it still wasn't out.  The  man said oh really went behind the counter and got onto his staff the man's name was the owner \"Biaggio\" he then returned to the man and stated that his order would be right out, when his order came out Biaggio went to the cash register and returned his money and gave him the order for free....Talk about service WOW!! I then decided to order a pastrami and cheese pizza...All I can say when the order came out was .....IT''S GOOD..Biaggio then came and sat with us while we eat and explained the foundation of this PIZZERA, which was great and even took time out of his busy routine to take a few photos with the folks from Arizona.  I can honestly say that when I return to vegas I'm gonna try the meatballs had a sample and ooooohhhhhh my God they are good..To all the people in Vegas you have a hidden gem that is worth every penny you better get over to Biaggio's Pizzeria and try it you wont be disappointed.",

Not only does Biaggios have incredible quality pizzas, they also have the best service of any restaurant I've been to.  About a year ago my friend and I came to pick up an order we had called in.  After arriving and about to pay, we both realized we didn't have enough money to pay for our meal.  I had left my wallet at a different location and immediately was bummed and told them the situation and that I was sorry that we had a pizza made for nothing.  The amazing Good Samaritan behind the counter let us take the pizzas for free!!. I owe this place big time. The pizza was delicious and while in Vegas, it was the only quality pizza I would have. Besides being the BEST pizza in Vegas, it also has the BEST staff I've ever encountered.  I hope my review convinced you to support this pizzeria and once you try it, you will taste what the fuss is all about.  EAT HERE! QUALITY",

We went to Biaggo's on a Sat afternoon and loved everything the owner gave us.  We order the pizza (which was inexpensive) half onion and half meatball.  The owner actually came and sat with us while we ate.  He brought over a couple meatballs with the best gravy i have had besides my mothers.  For desert he brought over the best zepploes with this raspberry sauce that actually tastes like a jelly donut.  We loved loved loved everything and would suggest this place to anyone.",

There is NO difference between the meatballs at biaggios and any other meatball delivered by Sysco to any other restaurant in the world. The ONLY difference is the lies that biaggio spreads about how they are a family recipe made by Analisa or whoever, it is all a lie! AND there are cockroaches in the place, if you dont believe that just go around the back of the place and outside the backdoor sitting on the ground are two large gray Ecolab roach baiting stations! Yes biaggio is pretty good at lying through his teeth and making people think he is something special but he is as fake as whatever that thing is that crawled up on his head and died! Yeah Its a cheapshot at a bad rug, but once you see how bad the rug is you can see how pathetic this liar is!!!",

As soon as I walked through the door, I was warmly greeted by the owner (Biaggio) who made me feel right at home.  After ordering my cheeze pizza, I sat and chatted with Biaggio who insisted that I try a meatball.  Of course, I graciously accepted and proceeded to eat the most delicioso meatball I've ever had.  It was so good that I asked Biaggio if he wouldn't mind giving me one more to take home for my wife to try.  He did me one better than that and gave me a free meatball sandwich!!  BTW, my wife loved it!! Thank you so much!  The pizza was delicious as well.  Highly recommended!!  I will be trying the cheesesteak next time.",

Extremely too many, we ended up scraping it off. Lesson learned, they are generous with their toppings!   We've had the Philly cheesesteak with French fries and they were both good. Sandwich is extremely greasy, it soaks into the bottom loaf. I've had them less greasy but it expected.   Cheesecakes were pretty good as well.   Customer service is great.

I asked if there was any specials and they said: \"No.\"  I personally like to feel like I'm getting a good deal but no deals on pizza here.  It's all full price.  The pizza was good and was ready on time without having to wait.  For that I'm thankful and may go back some day if I feel like splurging with family or friends that want really good tasting pizza without waiting for a long time.",

The service was friendly and delightful. The place was clean and comfortable. Their pizza dough is excellent and they do crust really really well. Their homemade Marinara sauce is terrific. Definitely worth visiting and make sure you try the desert. It's big so bring a few people to help you finish it.   Rants: They need to improve their signage for visibility. Both on the pylon and on the front of their storefront.  I was a little disappointed with the veggie calzone. It was cooked well but the veggies were not too cooked - kind of thrown in last minute and it was also light on the cheese. The positive is the size of the medium calzone was huge and I can't even imagine what the large calzone looks like!!!   Bottom line: Good value, good experience ... I will crave your garlic knots and your white pizza.  Thanks!    Phil",

Not only did we get the best pizza we received the best service.  The older gentleman came out and spoke with all of us to see if all was good. He was so sweet. He came out with zeppoles and a sugar pizza for dessert for the boys. We left full and satisfied. Great food accompanied by great service.  If your in town and close by, a definite place to check out..Thank you for a great experience",

Their garlic knots are the best I have ever had, their pizza is AMAZING, and the owner, Biaggio including his staff made  our experience over the top. It makes me happy to know that restaurants like this still exist!!!!!! GO GO GO GO GO",

My first bite, sitting across the table from Biaggio who wanted to look in my eyes when I first tasted his marinara, I literally had tears in my eyes. Ten years since I've eaten good ravioli, and this was it. He said he is going to continue to grow his gluten free menu, since he is gluten free himself. This is so special. I will be a regular!",

    "text": "So I am going to once again post about Biaggio's since Yelp hasn't kept my review up.  Well my wife and I have been back to Biaggio's many times now ( 5 times I think) and the food has been great every time!  I read some of the reviews on here complaining about Biaggio increasing the size of food or giving them food while they wait or if they ask how something is!?!?!  Really people this is something to complain about?  I guess I am confused, people saying don't be bought by the owner Biaggio.  Well unless I am confused about the process of business, a business supplies a service, the public enjoys the service and wants more of it, thus returning many times to have the service again.  So by Biaggio giving AMAZING service and product; I am some how selling my soul.  THIS IS WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN AT A RESTAURANT!!!!  I guess some of you Yelpers have had such poor service for so long you have forgotten.  Look it is simple! 1.  AMAZING SERVICE 2.  AMAZING FOOD 3.  OWNER TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY 4.  GO BACK OFTEN!!! None of this means anything shady is happening.  If I owned a store I would want return customers and for them to tell people about my store, this is good business and what A LOT of restaurants in the Valley could use lessons in.  Stop reading so much into it and go enjoy good food with good people at Biaggio's.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention they deliver ANYWHERE in Vegas...who does that?  How is this not 5 stars.  I also will not try to compare this to pizza in NY or Chicago, it is great pizza in Vegas.  So unless you plan on going 2500 miles for a slice do yourself a favor and don't over think it.  Best pizza in Vegas.  BY FAR THE BEST SERVICE IN VEGAS!",

Yeah, if you want a free mediocre pizza go to biaggios.  When I came in to get my carry out pizza, I was cornered by the owner and he basically begged me to give him a 5 star rating on yelp and tried to bribe me to do so with 2 meatballs and some stale foccacia bread. What ever happened to establishments on here earning their ratings by having FRESH DELICIOUS food - not handing out freebies and bribing their customers with mediocre frozen meatballs and their 5 hour old stale pizza \"by the slice\"? Call me old fashioned but I believe that you get what you pay for and well, since everything is FREE at biaggios, well you can obviously understand what exactly you get.....",

    "text": "My neighbor recommended this place to me after having their Italian sandwich.  Of course I had to try it, so on my first trip, I ordered the Italian sandwich.  It was very good, and had a generous amount of fine Italian meats and cheeses.  Even had enough left over for my lunch the next day.  I then saw they had zeppoles on their menu.  I LOVE zeppoles...but I am from NY so I had a different expectation, I guess.  Their version was almost raw pizza dough (?) with lots of powdered sugar, and a side of jam.  It tasted nothing like the zeppoles I know and love, but were satisfying in a dough-y, chewy sort of way.  OK, but probably won't order them again.   My next trip, I ordered a medium pizza, with their meatballs and sausage.  Meatballs were amazing, although very thinly sliced.  Sausage had a 'different' flavor, not the normal pizza type sausage I'm used to.  The owner is very friendly, and will offer samples if you want.  Place was busy on the times I have been there, so I think that is a good sign.  Price was a bit higher than I would have liked, but the food and service are a cut above the ordinary pizza places.  I definately will be back to try more items in the future.",
