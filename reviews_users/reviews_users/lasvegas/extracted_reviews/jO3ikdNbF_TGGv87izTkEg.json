Maybe some would enjoy mixing it all together, but the fettuccini alone is better without the marsala sauce mixed in. I did like the cheap side salad you can add to any lunch entree, my Caesar side was vey good.",

Such nice appointments all around this place and very home-like, warm feel with good waitstaff. But the food... My goodness.   The bread - cold and uneventfully tasteless. Lasagna - breaking down the ingredients  Tomato sauce - excitingly visual but way too sweet Cheeses - mediocre and unappealing. Pasta - equally bland like something from a large grocery store. The meat - like something from a popular chain taco fast food joint.  Overall - horribly disappointing",

It almost feels that Planet Hollywood that now own Buca has a problem with Italians.  I am sure if the restaurant served soul food they would not be playing Country music.  Bring back the Italian music, it's the right thing to do.",

Yes, they may not have the never ending breadsticks or salads but I can live without it in place of some hearty and good ol' Italian food. This place is family style and most small dishes can be split between 2-3 people. Yes, they are huge. I took my boyfriend here because he had never been and he had nothing but awesome things to say about it. We ordered the small Caesar salad which allotted for 2 servings each. He ordered the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  For drinks I ordered their red sangria and he ordered their Primo Margarita and both drinks were yummy. Our server Luis was very attentive and helpful with any questions we had regarding the menu. Our main dishes were huge and tasty. The prosciutto came with 3 pieces and the scampi was enough to feed 4-5 people. I had it for lunch for the rest of the week. I would definitely go back especially since its down the road from me. I just need to get out a little more. You know how it is...",

    "text": "Second or third time I've ever been to Buca. Second time at this location. I know some of my buddies aren't too impressed with this chain but it's not a bad place for some good authentic Italian food. Why is it good? Because my Italian friend said so.  The parking lot is pretty small as well as the restaurant itself. When you first walk in, you're greeted by the maitre'D. The waiting area is kind of small with two benches for convenience and comfort. Actually, it's not that the area is small but more cluttered.  All the dishes are available in small and large portions. Small portions are suitable for 3 person parties while the large portions can (supposedly) satisfy 6 people.  Environment: From ceiling to floor, the walls are decorated with Italian decor and pictures of their glory days including \"Miss Buca\" of several years. The seating areas look antique which correlates well with the rest of the facility.  Waiter:waitresses; not too bad. We ordered a lot if food and that have been the underlying reason for her many visits to our table. Regardless, she did a good job of making sure my buddies were happy and satisfied. Most impressive was the fact that she memorized our entire customized order. No pen and pad. Just memorization.  Food: Started off the night with French bread with wine and vinegar for dipping sauce. Nothing unusual or extraordinary. For appetizer, we ordered the large spicy calamari which is basically the \"fried calamari\" dish cooked with banana peppers for a nice kick. Slices of roasted banana peppers were used to garnish the fried seafood. Marinara mixed with garlic sauce added the perfect salty taste to complement the spicy and flavorful morsels of squid. For entrees, we had 3 dishes, pizza and two chicken selections. The pizza was a thin crust masterpiece covered with a small layer of fresh tomato sauce and melted cheese. Sausage and roasted tomato were scattered on top of the rectangular shaped pizza. The crust was crunchy on the bottom and slightly chewy on the top. The cheese was perfectly melted so that with each bite, you had to check your chin to make sure no residual cheese remained. Nothing spectacular about the sausage. The first chicken dish was slightly fried and covered in pesto sauce. The chicken was stuffed with mozzarella which oozed out with every bite. YUM! The last chicken dish was unremarkable in every way. Covered with a white cream sauce and capers.  Drinks: diet pepsi (they don't have coke).  Recommendation: EAT!!!",

Staff seems overpowering, not sure if it sounds scripted but to have a young guy pushing alcohol and appetizers is not welcoming to me  Might be good for a date if you like the same food or want to feel 'cute'.

The calamari was ok, I would give it a \"C\". Under seasoned, mostly tentacles, and served with a terrible sauce. It had a really \"tinny\" taste, like it came right from a can. I don't mind canned tomatoes, but I don't want to taste metal. Service was ok, not good. We noticed that every table but ours had bread, so we asked for some. We really shouldn't have had to ask. The lobster ravioli was odd. They were filled with a fishy puree and also had some larger chunks of lobster in them, and then covered with a terrible sauce. The seasonings were just weird and off, and again, the sauce tasted very metallic.  I went with a friend and she got \"that kind of sick\" about half an hour after we left and said she still felt sick  the next morning.  We both had exactly the same things, except for our beverages, and I didn't get sick. Our total for one sangria, two domestic beers, one calamari appetizer and one lobster ravioli entree was a little over $50 before the tip.",

Took a while to get our drinks, with no straws. Asked for straws. Got our salad. Server said garlic bread is coming right up. Finished salad and drink. Then a few minutes later came the straws. Asked for refills. Finally garlic bread came. 10 mins later after eating some garlic bread, refills came. Good thing I had my straw. Then came the meal. Not too bad. I seem to have a problem in this town asking for extra things and not getting it, or getting the very minimum one can possibly receive. The extra meat sauce came in a dipping sauce cup(about three tablespoons full). Seriously? Then it came time for dessert. Was going to get some ice cream, but two of my kids are allergic to milk, so I asked if they had sherbet. A simple yes or no would have sufficed. Instead I got huffed at and had a dessert menu shoved in my hand and was told \"this is what we have.\" So I dropped the menu, said forget dessert and asked for the check. RUDE! They got two stars for their portion sizes, but that's about it. Their food isn't anything to write home about, or get a good review. Prob won't be back.",

This time was quite aweful, I regretfully have to say. We arrived at 730 pm to celebrate my brothers bday and the server we had was discourteous the entire night. Now, I had a job working with customers and sometimes, like most of us, he could just had a bad day. Well this is not the case. Our server \"TRE\" was our server previously and had the same ill-mannered attitude like before. Not only did he make us feel unwelcomed, he did not even check on us to see if we needed silverware, napkins, more drinks, or ask how we were doing. We were never once greeted with a smile and he always made us feel as if we were a bother. Furthermore, we did not recieve our main entree until 905pm (our appetizers took a while as well). I am aware it was saturday and we had expected it to be busy, but the entire time we waited I had spotted him talking with co-workers. I also did not like how he talked to us as if we were idiots. I guess the sarcasm was a little over the top. We love this place, but these incidents might have us reconsidering a new dine-in spot, especially if we are going to be treated poorly.",

We experienced this first hand a few weeks ago.  We ordered the Bucatini Ala Enzo, Pancetta, Prosciutto, button mushrooms, peas and pasta.  Well while eating, I discovered wax paper still on the prosciutto.  I informed our waitress who apologized and went to find out what it was.  While she was gone, we found several more pieces.   The manager came out, apologized, explained what it was, offered us a replacement entree and comped our meal.  There you have it, a well handled mess.  We love Buca, the portions are worth it, the prices are value for the amount of food you get, and usually the quality is above average, especially for a chain.  They handled this situation very well and we were left satisfied that it would be safe to come back again.  Till next time...",

We ordered Fettucine Alfredo, because who could go wrong with Fettucine Alfredo, right? WRONG. it was a huge pile of dried noodles with a sticky, thick, gooey, dry-tasting sauce. Two other tables near us complained about how horrible the food tasted. One guy said what we were thinking, \"it's like my food had been sitting out for half a day.\" Unfortunately, i could no longer eat because I was quite nauseas, and so was my friend. We left feeling sick and extremely disappointed. What a way to ruin a good Las Vegas trip.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try this place.  I heard the food was good and I live near the restaurant.  I actually ordered my meal online for take-out.  The website menu was easy to go through.  Ordering online was simple and smooth.  I figured I would try the baked ziti.  I went to the restaurant to pick up the meal and the people were friendly and attentive.  The ambiance was nice and it smelled fantastic.  I was really looking forward to trying the baked ziti.  I picked up my order and drove home.  When I opened up the bag it had two huge containers and a bag of italian bread.  You get a lot of food for your money.  However, the baked ziti was a complete let down.  Actually the worst pasta I have had in my life.  It looked like they got off to a good start on the dish, they just didn't any sauce to the pasta.  In this huge container of pasta there could only have been 1-2 tablespoons of sauce.  The pasta being baked without sauce was very dry and tasted awful. I just spent $30 on a meal and it's inedible.  These high ratings for this restaurant chain must be for locations other than this one here in Summerlin.  The food court at the mall provides a better meal than this Buca di Beppo location.  If an italian restaurant can't even cook a simple pasta dish, I know I will never go back to try anything else.  Pasta is the simplest meal to make I know.  Boil in water and add sauce.  Simple.  At least they got it half right, they cooked the pasta (which dried out quickly without sauce).  This place was a complete waste of money and time.  That's it...  I have to go to McDonald's now to get something to eat - I'm hungry!",

The dishes are meant for sharing, but seriously, a family of twelve couldn't even dent the spaghetti bowls. My friend Jackie had her cosmetology school graduation party here, and as a party of thirty, we definitely only needed to order about ten dishes. The food is tasty and all of the dishes are recognizable. The walls are lined with all sorts of trinkets and doodads to look at while you wait (even with a reservation, please believe you will wait at least thirty minutes) and has a real old school Vegas/Italian mobster feel. Never go on a weekend evening, it is too much to handle (think back to the party of forty) and the service is backed up to the point of turtle slow. But if you can get in on a weeknight, I suggest bringing an empty stomach!  Recommended entre: I'm a meatball girl, so I always go with meatballs and spaghetti  Recommended company: Your entire girl scout troop, or at least a group of four.",

    "text": "This has been my family's go to restaurant for all of our group celebrations for over 12 years. We've never had a problem until recently. Service has gotten considerably slower and less friendly over time, until it's time for the check of course because then the waiter/waitress is anticipating a tip. None the less, we still go to Buca because it's one of the only family style restaurants in town. However, Easter of this year makes me want to find a new place for my family to explore and consider cancelling my graduation dinner reservation. On Easter I called in to try to be put on the waitlist ahead of time. I would have made a reservation, but some of my family didn't know if they could get the time off, so I didn't. I was told I couldn't call in ahead to be put on the waitlist, fine I understand restaurants have policies for a reason. I then ask to know how long the wait time is and I'm transferred to the host stand. They take a little while to answer the phone and then I'm told in a very displeased voice that the wait would be at least 2 hours. By this time all my family had disbursed to drive to Buca as it was raining and we couldn't stand out in the rain trying to figure out a lunch spot. I make it to Buca and decide to double check inside to see if the 2 hour wait time was still accurate. I walk in to three hosts that reaffirm in not only a negative tone but also negative body language that the 2 hour wait was indeed correct. I was treated like I was an idiot for even double checking in the first place. I walk outside and by this time the hosts are blatantly staring down me and my friend that went in to double check. This was completely unprofessional behavior. They should have been happy to answer my question. Besides the waiting area was nearly empty it wasn't like there was a line of people waiting to ask a question. My family has literally spent thousands of dollars at Buca over the years to be treated nasty by the front of house staff. Completely unacceptable. This experience just reaffirms that Buca Di Beppo is becoming a lesser quality experience. It used to be top notch customer service. Maybe new management policies are making it a quantity over quality experience.. who knows. My family called in to Romano's Macaroni Grill just 2 minutes down the road on Rainbow and Lake Mead and they set up a table for us by the time we drove over. The quality of the food was better there anyway and my family thoroughly enjoyed our Easter lunch.",

The original room that we chose, the Wine Room, the AC was out on the day of the event, so we set things up in another room and it was fabulous.   For our appetizer, we had the mozzarella caprese, which was delicious! Tomatoes with fresh basil and olive oil...fabulous. Then we had two salads: a mixed green, and the apple gorgonzola - which was by far the family favorite!  Next we had the chicken parmigiana, and it was fantastic. Nice crisp breading in a marinara sauce topped with mozzarella. We also had fettuccine Alfredo, and spaghetti with meat sauce. Both equally delicious.   Finally, it was the desserts: double dark chocolate cake, and of course, tiramisu.   It was a great event with fabulous food.  Thank you Buca di Peppo for making this a great experience.",

The servers are usually attentive and very friendly, sometimes they don't visit the back corners as often though.  Also some of the cushions need new springs or should be replaced as they sink in a lot in some places. We had to be reseated multiple times because of it and we both way under 150lb.

I told her that it will be my birthday in a couple of days. She even came back to our table to ask my name and how to spell it. At some point during our dinner, some waitresses and waiters came together to the table next to us with a candle, a dessert, and sang a birthday song (they even asked us to be part of the \"celebration\" by singing to the 'birthday gentleman').

I'd visit here solely for his service but the food is yummy too!",

    "text": "This location is absolutely awful. My bf and I were new to town and figured let's eat somewhere we already know, so we choose buca plus it was my favorite place to eat at. We were seated right away at dinner time. They did not look extremely busy, we were greeted 20 minutes later by the server which seemed like forever being that we were both hungry and tired from work. A family seated behind us who arrived after us already received their food before we even placed an order. A worker was walking to each table who looked like some sort of manager, he never came to our table until we called him over and explained our poor service we were receiving. So he finally got someone to take our order and she was completely rude. Got partial of our order wrong. My bf and I were genuinely disappointed because we loved eating here back in LA. We spoke to the manager once more before we left and he apologized which we appreciated. There was a worker who kept providing us with refills while we waited for our rude server which didn't appear to be his section, so we decided to go up to him personally and give him a nice tip.  And coming from the food industry we both understand what it's like to be disapproved of service/quality so we tried to be as respectful as we could have been. I wouldn't go back because I did not feel comfortable there.   I'm hoping buca does not reach back out to me since we've already received an apology but this is just to inform the public not to expect a 10/10 food service! and what I went through and how I felt dining at this location.    Also I'm pretty sure their ingredients/recipes changed because it no longer tastes as good as it used to.",

    "text": "This is a very family friendly establishment. Ideal for larger parties celebrating special events. The Summerlin location is quite large and the facility is broken up into smaller dining areas. The store is decorated, floor to ceiling, in a kitschy Italian motif. All their entrees are served \"family-style\" (large portions) and are meant to be shared. I am sure in most cases this works fine except if it is just one or two people dining. In addition, this does not work very well if everyone in the party wants to eat something different or cannot agree on what to share. On to the food. My wife ordered the \"small\" portion (serves 3) of Chicken Limone with lemon butter sauce & capers. It came with three chicken breasts and sauce. That's it. My wife thought it should have come garnished with lemon. This dish was quite tasty, but at $27 I felt it should have come with a side of pasta or house salad. This evening they were running a half price special for Spaghetti and Meatballs with two large meatballs and homemade marinara sauce. I am not a connoisseur of Italian food, but I know what I like and this dish fell flat in my estimation. There was plenty of pasta, but not enough marinara. Even with the meatballs this entree lacked flavor. This dish normally comes in at $27. The half off special brought it down to $13.50. Portion aside, even at $13.50, I would not order this again and do not recommend it. Service was friendly, but the food took over a half hour to come out. Fortunately, we were not in a hurry and they brought out bread and butter when we were seated.",

They got my order wrong, but, instead of just giving me the large pizza, rather than the correct small pizza, they cut it into thirds.   I got 1/3 of a cold pizza, while some other unsuspecting customer got a cold, old pizza. I told them I would pick order up AT 6:45.  It had been made early, so it was cold, needed to heat it in microwave. The online system was out of order.  I called in the order, cashier confirmed SMALL, but they made LARGE. I heated in microwave and I live 2 blocks away. Third Time is NOT a charm.  I is a signal to go somewhere else. And, to make it worse, the manager acts as though it is the customer's fault that the order is wrong. For the prices they charge, they could at least include some courtesy and a smile.",

    "text": "I recently moved from San Francisco where Buca di Beppo was a huge hit.   When I saw one close by to my new house in Las Vegas, I got really excited.   Believe me, the food is just as amazing as it was in SF but it's the service at this location that really sets it apart from other restaurants.  The last few times I've gone, I had Sarah as a waitress. She's very knowledgable about the menu, she has a great attitude, and she's also very understanding/accommodating. The last time me and my boyfriend came in, we walked in 5 minutes before they closed and dined in. We felt really guilty about holding the staff passed closing but everyone, and I mean everyone including the manager, was really sweet! Lewis, the Sous Chef, brought our starter and entree out. At the end of the meal, he came back around to ask how we enjoyed everything. I was highly impressed. It really showed a sense of compassion towards the establishment to see the Chef come out and ask how everything was. It was completely professional and very much appreciated.   The entrees are HUGE and even the \"Small\" can easily feed two really hungry people. The Baked Ziti with a side of Garlic Cheesy bread is really good. The Shrimp Florentine is also really delicious! Come to think of it, I haven't tried anything from Buca that I haven't liked.  Long story short, this place is AWESOME! The service, the food, and overall atmosphere is an A+.   Definitely one of my favorite places to dine, don't be surprised if you see me there if you go in to eat :)",

The famous Buca di Beppo  \"chef's table in the kitchen\"  isn't allowed in Clark County, so it's sort of a table next to the kitchen with a big window looking in.  Food is bland, tasteless, and everything costs extra. Read that: Everything. Extra sauce, extra pasta, refill on the bread will cost you more so hold that thought.  Service is OK, big portions and big prices and they do run out of menu items.  If you have one of those big families where ya wanna pass the baby(s) around the table, and the kids can get a little louder than normal and do pre-dinner table top activities like coloring and such,,, you can talk at above normal levels which is standard for any Italian family,, make some noise,, it's OK here.  Wish they'd improve the flavor of the menu. Probably comes frozen to the location from the company and is warmed and served. It ain't fresh cooked, you can count on that.  I dunno,,, like I said, we eat here by default and it has it's place for families and groups,, but if it was just the wife and I we'd go some place else and get much better for the money.",

    "text": "Today's experience was just awful, plain and simple. I don't even know where to begin, but here goes.   Came here with my hubby for a late lunch before he needed to go back to work.  He ordered the lunch chicken parm and our server said it comes with a side of pasta and you pick another side. My hubby and I both looked at each other like what? Because we had just been in the week before and it came with one side, the pasta being a choice. We asked the waitress if she was sure and she said yes. So he ordered the potatoes, thinking he was getting chicken parm, side of spaghetti marinara AND also potatoes. But when his plate comes out, it's just the chicken parm and potatoes. We asked where the pasta was and she said that's the side you ordered. So a crazy weird mix up there.   Then I had ordered the dinner size small spaghetti marinara knowing there would be leftovers to take home. But when the waitress read back my order she said the large spaghetti marinara. I had to correct her that I wanted the small dinner size.  When this came out, the bowl was fairly small, not the usual size it supposed to be, and then to top it off, the marinara was runny and non-existent, not the thick marinara that it usually is and there was plenty of liquid at the bottom. Just gross.. I asked the waitress why the size is smaller than usual, and she says that's the size it is. I disagreed on that. But she was long gone, going to get the missing side of pasta for my husband.   So since the waitress hadn't come back yet I went looking for the manager as we were on a time schedule and that time was running out. I found our waitress behind the bar area and when I asked for the manager, she pointed to a lady at the other end of the bar from where we were. I know the manager heard me ask about a manager but did not make a move toward me.. So I had to walk over and ask if she was the manager, she said yes, and I proceeded to tell her that we needed to leave, the food was all messed up and we did not have time for them to fix it as we needed to go. She did come to the table and saw about the spaghetti and did agree about the marinara being runny and she did agree that the size was wrong and that it should be larger. By this time the waitress had come back with my husband's side of spaghetti marinara. His marinara looked better than mine in that it was thicker on top but it still had liquid on the bottom. Makes you wonder if the cooks understand that you need to STRAIN the pasta before you pour the sauce on top SMH. The manager did see this and agreed that the liquid needed to be strained off his pasta, so she took it to the kitchen.   Right about this time is when my husband tells me his chicken parm tastes awful, very hard and unplatable. When the manager brought back the side pasta we told her about the chicken and said we just needed to go. We don't want anything, it's all just a mess. She did give us the side of pasta to take. We just left shaking our heads thinking what in the world just happened here?   Our last visit the week before was perfect. We came about 9 pm and sat in the bar area and our waitress was so attentive and friendly, service was perfect and the food was yummy (we ordered the exact same thing as today). That's the reason we were craving it again. This time was a disaster and it makes me wonder if we can ever come back. Sad because we love the food. :(",

    "text": "Very disappointing.   Been coming for over 15 yrs to the Summerlin location.  Quality has totally gone downhill.   Ordered pepperoni pizza, fettuccini Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs.   Pizza was ok but pastas were horrible.  Absolutely NO taste.   Everyone in our group of 5 agreed.   It's like they forgot to use any garlic, salt, basil or pepper.    One of guests in our group hit the nail on the head...we should have known something was up when no garlic smell was either inside or outside of restaurant!!!!   Told manager and she said thanks for telling her.   Will NOT be returning.   Sad.  Had so many good memories here.    Olive Garden is so much better and not as expensive.",

    "text": "It's been a really long time since I've dined at Buca di Beppo since it hasn't been on my agenda, however, my fiance's company decided to have their holiday party here. There were 20 people in our group and we had one of their sections equipped with five booths and a long table. The space we were given was rather small and the booths were very uncomfortable. The cushions gave way that you could feel the reinforcements under the seating and there was very little room between the table and benches. It was also difficult to interact with anyone other than those at your booth, so it defeated the purpose of having a large group space (the area is not intended for a gathering of that sort). Service was pretty good, but not spectacular. My fiance's boss had to constantly flag down the server to refill beverages, so I even suggested to leave the pitchers (the server didn't do that though and we continued the refill game throughout the evening).  Apparently there was bread, but none made it to our table, so I didn't have the opportunity to try it. So, our meal began with Bruschetta. The bruschetta itself was pretty tasty and it was served on a large garlic bread loaf, which also had good flavor. However, it was extremely difficult to eat since the slices were enormous and the bread was challenging to cut with butter knives. I've never seen bread slices served that large, with or without something on top of it. Our next appetizer was the Chopped Antipasto Salad with pepperoni, red onions, pepperoncini, cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, kalamata and green olives, provolone, feta, Gorgonzola, and lettuce in their signature Italian vinaigrette. This was good. A bit heavy on the dressing, but otherwise really great combination of ingredients.  For our entrees, we had Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, and Chicken Marsala. I tried just a bite of the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was fine; it's not something I would ever order since it's much too boring. The Spaghetti was unsurprisingly overcooked and the meat sauce was all right. Still, the most eatable dish. The Chicken Marsala was blah. Chicken breast was overcooked (dry) and the sauce was too sweet and tasted too much of wine, in a bad way. It was a good thing I wasn't hungry or I would have been pretty cranky.   Dessert was Tiramisu and Double Dark Chocolate Cake. I went straight for the tiramisu since it is one of my favorite desserts, but alas, I was disappointed. The dark rum soak was overpowering and the harmonious flavors of espresso, cocoa, and Mascarpone were mangled. The chocolate cake earned a shrug.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy dinner very much. I mean, the best item was the salad. Positive notes: I like the family-style dining, their decor is fun, and with a better seating situation, I think it's a great atmosphere for a family/friends gathering.",

    "text": "I used to love eating here, but tonight was the last time I'll ever go there again. My boyfriend & I decided to go to use a gift card I'd gotten awhile ago. I made the mistake of telling our server (Deanna) this when she asked if we were celebrating anything special. Once she heard that, her kind and helpful manner went out the window. We ordered our drinks & appetizers around 6:45 had almost finished them at 7:15 before we had to get her attention from the table next to us to order our meals.  I am not an impatient person, & have worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, but it was getting to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to her. She didn't bring us our food, extra napkins, or anything after taking our meal orders...it was all bussers, which I have to say were amazing & took great care of us.  We asked for the check, mind you every time I had to ask her for something was when she was helping the table next to us, who was a party of 6 that she sat 15 mins after us, & got them done & out almost a half hour after us.  Once we got the check it only got worse. She left it sitting with us for another 10-15 mins, came and snatched it when she finally came by, and then stayed in the back with our gift card & debit card for another 10. When my boyfriend asked what was taking so long she said it was because she had to run the gift card and then transfer the difference? When she finally brought  it back she mumbled \"sorry it took so long but it's because of your gift card\".  When we left I checked the receipt because the gift card was for $50. She had only ran it for $46.25. Odd right? So I checked our bank account, & she had in fact charged my debit card twice. We went in and spoke to the manager & explained what all had happened, & when she called Deanna over, she claimed that she thought our debit card was the gift card.  I don't buy it, she was awful to us because she assumed since we had a gift card that we wouldn't tip, then blamed us for our checkout process being so long on the gift card, & then when all was said and done, you didn't know which one was the gift card?! Sorry but no. Save yourself the time & headache & go elsewhere. I'd like to believe the best about people, but it was clear that this girl took it upon herself & decided that we were an inconvenience & wouldn't tip her because we had a gift card. When in fact we are quite the opposite. Even if we were the worst customers & just taking advantage of a cheap meal, that's not for you to decide! Nor is it your place to make paying customers who come to YOUR choice of profession, feel unwelcome & at fault for your own greed & bad attitude.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the service was very poor. It took about 10 minutes for someone to notice us and order our drinks. Thankfully the manager was around and he took care of our order even before our waitress came. Buca's idea is to be able to share your meal with your familia! The problem I see with this is that for just 2 people is hard to decide on one plate. However, I'm sure the concept works great for big groups. The food is good but is nothing that I would be craving. I would still recommend the apple gorgonzola salad which was great!",

I came in with a party of 9 people due to my little brother's birthday. The food was exceptional and I enjoyed it but our server was slow. We waited maybe about 25 minutes for our food and after we ate, we waited for another 35 minutes for him to acknowledge the fact that we wanted to order dessert. (we mentioned multiple times that we were celebrating a birthday) We still received slow service from our waiter. Why? He was too busy talking to his coworkers. I get it. It was slow and he may just wanted to take his \"time.\" It bothers me that this particular waiter doesn't believe in exceptional customer service and instead would rather blow off his customers.  We should have just told the waiter to pack our dessert to-go. It shouldn't have taken 25 minutes to give us our dessert. After we were done we waited again for him to acknowledge that we wanted to pay already. Really? My family and I were fed up. He's lucky that my parents tipped him 25 bucks. He shouldn't have gotten any tip for the poor service he gave us.",

    "text": "So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.    We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful.   I ordered the \"Penne Arrabbiata\" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the \"Baked Lasagna\" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious!   You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up \"Party Pans\" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!",

    "text": "I've lived in Las Vegas for 3 years now, and only just last week did I hear about this restaurant from some co-workers. Four of us went to dinner on a Sunday at 7, and the first thing I noticed was the full parking lot. I expected it to be half empty, at best, at the end of the weekend. The second noticeable thing about this place was the interior decor. I've read some of the other reviews on here about the decor, and while I can see why some patrons didn't care for it, I loved it. I loved the black and white photos on the walls, the antique furniture in the lobby, and the empty, multi-colored wine bottles in the racks on the ceiling. All of that, along with the Greek-style statues, gave the place an old-world, homey feel. I couldn't wait to taste the food.  Since there was four of us, we each ordered a small entree. I was able to sample the chicken saltimbocca, chicken marsala, shrimp florentine, and fettucini supremo. Simply put, all of it was incredible. Until now, I though Olive Garden was the best Italian I'd ever had, but this place makes OG look like McDonald's. The portions, even on a small entree, were more than enough for four of us, and we each took home plenty of leftovers.  And then, as if that wasn't good enough, I decided to sample the dessert menu. I ordered the Italian creme cake, the cheesecake, and my coworkers ordered the chocolate chip cannolis. In my limited foodie experience, most restaurants have the desserts delivered and kept frozen until ready to serve. They taste no better than what you find in the freezer section of your local grocery. This was most definitely NOT the case with Buca di Beppo. Of those three that we sampled, my favorite was the cheesecake. Really good cheesecake is hard to find, and this place more than did it justice. The giant slice came with raspberry topping and hazelnuts. It was hard not to be rude and devour the whole damn thing in front of my co-workers. The Italian creme cake was also to die for, and the cannoli was amazing. (I'd never actually had a cannoli before, but, judging by the other desserts, I'm sure this place would take the blue ribbon if it put them a contest.)  All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my dining experience at Buca di Beppo. and, if I could afford it, I would eat here every night.",

It had to of been about 50 people.  BUT you would think a restaurant that serves such large family style dishes, would be able to handle a party of that many, apparently for one of their staffers, not.   So our food was basically preordered and the menu was set for us.  Food was okay, it wasn't spectacular thats why I can't even describe it.  I just wanted to review our service though.   One of the waitresses, was frazzled from the very beginning.  Myself and a few other people in the party observed it early in our dinner.  I mean, she couldn't get the drink orders straight, kept forgetting to bring us simple utensils to eat our food, plates, too, it also took forever to bring our drinks to us.  When we were finally given the bill for our drinks, after requesting it 3x, we immediately gave our card since we had no cash to pay for it.  She came back and said I'm sorry I charged it out to cash, can you pay it by cash?  What?! Your mistake, you fix it.  I mean, why would you even bring that back to your customer.  It didn't upset us or anything, but it seems compared to her other coworkers that served flawlessly, she could not compare.  So our waitress, frazzled.  Not that she was mean to us particularly, but man she gave off she was having a bad day.",

    "text": "Ordered online 3 days prior to Valentines Day. Order a large lasagna and antipasti salad for pick up at 5:15. As I was driving to pick up order, I get a call at 5:10 that they are out of lasagna and will be another hour until they have more made. Really?? I asked for a manager if they could provide another item. Got it settled and the manager Kendal would have my lasagna ready. Got to restaurant and line is out the door waiting for pickup. Get to pickup window at 5:45, WOW!!!! Got my food home and lasagna was horrible with soggy noodles, no sauce, no cheese on top and way too much ricotta cheese in middle. It's like they rushed order and forgot about the rest. The bread was black and over cooked. They did give a free heart shaped pizza that was horrible and not edible. Definitely not what I expected paying $66. Will never return again. Not the Valentines Day dinner I wanted. Called and spoke with Joe to refund my purchase for the lasagna only. I hope this happens. How could a restaurant send food out like this?",

Told us they lost our order but somehow made my nieces pizza and delivered it No one seems to be in charge or take blame.  Everyone points fingers at the next person.

    "text": "Great food, large servings, excellent service and left feeling stuffed. Exactly what a good dining experience should be.   Went here to have a late lunch with my wife and in-laws. We've been to this location previously and enjoyed our meal last time and decided that it was finally time to pay another visit. We ordered the following: -fried calamari  -chicken stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella entree -linguine frutti di mare pasta dish -shrimp florentine pasta dish  First off, the entree and pasta servings are large and thus the dishes are sized family style rather than as an individual plate. There were four of us in our party and we ordered the small sizes for the entree and pastas. Needless to say, even though we ordered the small servings, we still had plenty to take home.   All of the items we ordered were great.  The fried calamari was fried nicely and not overly breaded. Even though the menu indicated that it was spicy, the spice level wasn't overpowering to me.  The chicken in pesto sauce stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella was a very pleasant surprise. The chicken was tender and moist and the prosciutto and mozzarella inside was very tasty. The breading on the chicken wasn't too salty and the pesto sauce was a nice compliment to the chicken.  The pasta dishes were excellent. They both had plenty of shrimp, calamari, and mussels in them. The sauces were flavorful.   To conclude our dinner, we ordered a super brownie sundae since we had a coupon for a free serving. Lots of whipped cream on top, but the chocolate and vanilla ice cream and the brownie underneath were good.   Our server, Riley, was excellent. She was very pleasant and attentive. She was prompt and checked on us often.   The restaurant itself is large inside and consists of several distinctive dining rooms and has very eclectic and interesting decor. Lots of items, memorabilia and pictures of notable Italian celebs and people on the walls.  If you want a good hearty Italian meal that will stick to your ribs and feed a lot of people, I highly recommend coming here.",

All the others had been there several times so I let them do all of the ordering and I must say I was extremely surprised at how good all of the food was and the portions are massive !! We had shrimp pasta, spaghetti and meatballs, two salads and calamari. The kitchen was not afraid to use lots of garlic and that made me happy !!! The one flaw that I see that others have mentioned is that it took FOREVER to get our drinks. I finally got up and found the bar and there was nobody there but a bartender and our waitress chatting away. I would go back again with a group but NOT for a date night.",

Lindsay went above and beyond the required call of duty to help me plan and make everything perfect with so much patience and care and was always there to answer a question and help. We had the Supremo package with Bruschetto,  Caesar & Antipasti Salads, Penne San Remo & Baked Rigatoni and Chicken Parmigiano, Chocolate cake and Tiramisu. The food was of the utmost Excellent quality, made to perfection and because they were so busy with bookings, Ryan was the only server who was so fast with the best service you could ever possibly wish or hope for. The entire group was so impressed with him and Lindsay and every staff member who passed and greeted us. They were all like a part of our extended family. All the left over food, which was alot, was boxed and labeled to take and who else does that??? Every single guest absolutely loved the food, the place, our server and Lindsay and said it was a perfect event if there ever was one and made me proud and hope it makes Bucas and Lindsay and Ryan and all the awesome staff feel proud. Needless to say we were so pleased and when you are so busy and on a continual basis and to continue with the highest quality food service and respect to everyone, you will always have our referrals and repeat business. Thank you for everything.",

Ugh who loses a credit card!?!? Ok so now to our issues, well we both asked for waters and she asked \"with lemon\" we both said yes she' comes back with 2 water one with lemon and one without lemon she's said \" oh I forgot I didn't know if u wanted it with lemon or not\" so I said it's ok no worries, then while my boyfriend was not looking I told her it's my boyfriends birthday today she's winked back and said \" ok got it\" as were having our dinner she boxes up our food and Says \"any dessert for tonight\" I said yes \"plain cheesecake\" she's said \"I'll bring that right out for you\" as I waited and waited and WAITED they never came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend and she brought us our tab and I said uhhh did u forget our cheesecake she's said\" oh yea I'll bring it right up\" This was really upsetting due to the fact that it was my boyfriends birthday, she DID not deserve our tip she was a horrible waitress. Were never going back to this bucca de beppo. Flamingo location is way better. *Thumbs down*",

We also got a $10 off coupon in a ValPak so why not? I've been to the one in Universal Citywalk in LA a few times for birthdays and always had a decent night.   They walked us through the kitchen which my BF liked and said the other location didnt take him the two times he's gone. I definitely respect this that you get to see a clean kitchen and they are proud to pass people through it before seating them.  We ordered a  Penne San Remo (chicken breast, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, peas,cream sauce). Big family serving even for a \"small\". Pretty decent dish, just needed a little salt and it was right on.  They gave us a bread basket and bread was cold....I'm noticing this a lot in restaurants lately- refrigerated bread served as is. Anyways it was decent for sopping up cream sauce.  Service was decent, the lady was on refilling drinks and checking up on us.   Overall, alright spot. I think it would be better if we showed up for lunch since they have individual portions or come when we got a hungry group of friends.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Buca di Beppo for many years and I've always enjoyed their food.  Although I stopped coming after they removed one of my all-time favorite dishes (the tortellini).  It's hard to find any Italian restaurants that serve tortellini (especially good tortellini), so I'm still disappointed that they have not added it back to their menu since Planet Hollywood took over ownership.  However they still offer ravioli's, which are extremely good.  I also ordered the baked ziti & spaghetti.  I've had much better baked ziti, so I won't order that from here again, and I also made the mistake of ordering the plain Marmara spaghetti instead of the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Their marinara spaghetti is very bland but the spaghetti with meat sauce is much better.   So in summary: Ravioli- Excellent Spaghetti with meat sauce- Great Spaghetti with marinara- Bland, flavorless Baked Ziti- I've had much better Tortellini- Excellent (Please bring this dish back to the menu, PLEASE)",

    "text": "Reasonable priced Italian food with a interesting atmosphere. This is a great place a gathering of any kind. If you have never been before tell the hostess and they will walk you for a little tour of the kitchen.  I have been eating here for years on many different occasions and I always leave full and pleased with what I ordered. For a larger party call ahead and make a reservation. They have a variety of strange and interesting dinning areas you can choose from if you reserve a table. The food is served mostly in family style portions which is to say most things you order will feed more then 2 people. Before you order the server usually warns you about the portions so you know what to expect. The food here is above the Olive Garden standard. They serve food which is more Italian home style. Overall the food is tasty and the atmosphere makes for a great time at a reasonable price. They also have a constant running coupon in the papers dinning section which will save you some money!",

I left one star on my rating that goes out to the silver fox who sereved us she was nice polight and funny I want her to know she does a great job. But the food is a major problem. I paid for two people tonight and I could have bought dinner for six people at Stieners and the quality of food would still be much better. My tab was $70.00 for two 5 oz mixed drinks that cost 20.00 one of the smallest chewiest burnt orders of calamari for $15.00 and a two person serving size portion of veal that sucked so small 3 tiny pieces of veal with no pasta on the side for $27.00. I was insulted with this meal. I hope my tab helps keep you in business just long enough to change your old fashioned cash grab ways. I will never return to this restaurant so long as I live and if your a patron who enjoys real italian food look up Capos on Sahara. You'll spend the same but you'll have an amazing experience. The only way I would remove this post is they refunded me for half of my tab. I honestly felt we only consumed $35.00 worth in food",

What makes eating here so worthwhile is the $10 off $20 coupons that they always seem to have around, both online, via e-mail, etc. I had three of them in my Entertainment Coupon Book.  I like their fried calamari because they not only include the rings, but also the full body of squid... *crunch, crunch* Their linguine frutti de mare is quite tasty if you are a fan of seafood. I have not had this elsewhere to compare, but I like it, especially the part where I get to open up the clams.   I have also had the stuffed shells. A picture of these might cause you to start drooling; that is what got me! Unfortunately, I was not fond of them. They are quite spicy (which I was unaware of when I was ordering, that was my bad), but they did not taste good in general and you do not get very many shells.  They do banquet catering and off-site catering. They even have a wedding brochure.   I only go here when I have a coupon, but for italian food --- I would still prefer Olive Garden. Unfortunately, they are always more packed than this place.",

However if you think that tasteless food (in large quantities), served by bored, zombie wait-staff is something to cheer about, and you've hit all the buffets in town, then perhaps this is your kind of place. However, if food with taste and style and care is what you're willing to pay hard-earned dollars for, then this is the Gateway to Hell. God help all who enter.",

It is better than say something like Olive Garden,  but I still have her better and more authentic Italian food. We went for a family birthday with a large group and had reservations at 7. We got there on time and the hostess said the group sitting at our table was about to leave.  So we waited, and waited. We did not end up getting to our table until almost an hour later. I realize it is kind of awkward for the staff but that is a pretty big delay and it was not packed. The Manager comped our apatiser orders (two I think) so that kind of made up for it. Our waiter was super patient and helpful and the staff came out to sing happy birthday. But something did not sit well in what I ate and I had pretty bad stomach issues that kept me up and going to the bathroom. So that is why I had to give it a three. But again, the staff was great other than not getting us seated in a timely manner.",

We asked for sauce \"it's being cooked right now\" WHAT?! We had no pepper flakes at the table and had to ask for them and share them with another table. The service was ok. I hate this place it's a huge rip off. $25 for a pasta bowl which had about $1 worth of pasta and about 1/2 can of tomatoes at best. Stay home and open a can of ragu you'll be eating better than at this place. Terrible.",

The chicken parm we thought was going to be promising based on looks alone because the chicken pieces were HUGE tasted like those frozen chicken patties you get out of the grocery store. It did not taste like chicken at all, more like a breaded piece of rubber. Then the baked rigatoni... we can always count on the baked rigatoni to be good. Nope. It was dry.. crunchy... no flavor. I'm not kidding the WORST thing ever. This almost $80 meal I got was so bad,  I went to pasta idea across the parking lot the next day to try to forget that whole thing happened.

You can also order different types of bread, but the bread that comes with the meal is great. Crunchy outside with soft middle. Wanted dessert but was stuffed AND had food left to take home. We are definitely going back to this restaurant!",

We had a good time and really good food, but what made our night awesome was our waiter Adrian. We will NOT be going back unless he is there! He did a really good job making sure everyone had everything they needed even though he was SUPER busy with quite a few tables and several large parties. He still made time to take photos for us, our order was perfect and most importantly he was so very kind & patient. He's a dad who works hard for his family and it shows. I suggest you request him next time you stop by, I promise your night  will be 10x better if you do.",

We visited this location on a Sunday night and were seated in booths in the bar area, which was perfect because football was on TV. Although the bartender was our server, he was pretty quick and came back many times to check on us throughout the meal.   There was 4 of us so we opted for a large proscuitto stuffed chicken (5 pieces) and a large baked rigatoni (don't do it, it's HUGE! - 2 lbs worth). Needless to say, we finished the chicken but had plenty of pasta leftover. This is the first time I've ever had leftovers at Buca, so I was surprised when we asked for a box, the waiter came by and packed our pasta into boxes for us and threw in bags of warm bread as well.   This location doesn't get as crowded as the Flamingo location, however, you can make reservations as well if you'd like. We had a great time/meal here and I'll definitely be back, especially because I wanted to try their dessert but we were all too full to attempt it...",

I made reservations online and upon arrival they placed us in our own little tiny room section that was decorated beautifully . I posted a photo it was a night that had amazing service . I am not used to that when going to a chain especially with such a large party. To be honest a big reason might be because they don't automatically add gratuity on to the bill . Keep in mind that could always change so don't bank on that . I got a whole bunch of gift cards from costco to make the meal more affordable but if you join their bucca club they are always sending coupons . My favorite food of the night was the gnocchi but beware it's got a bit of  a kick!!! Now that I am writing about it I want to go get some right now!! This is a great place for good Italian food without is being outside of your budget!  I'm gonna list what we got but spare you the details of what it is because let's face it the menu can tell you that just fine . All I can say is everything we tried we loved and had left overs! Bucca trio platter  Large mozerella garlic bread  Prosciutto stuffed chicken Large ziti  Small Beppos soffici cuscini Rosemary potatoes",

The restaurant is very well decorated and laid out with Italian memorabilia, paintings, old photos of icons, and decor. It's very cozy and I loved the ambience.  Our server was very friendly and got our drinks and bread immediately. The bread dipped in oil and basalmic vinegar is sooooooooo good.  I ordered the lasagna and my gf ordered one of the specials. We ordeed bruschetta for an appetizer and tiramisu for dessert.  The food was amazing! My lasagna was huge and perfect texture and very tasty. My gf loved her pasta special, I don't remember exactly, because she had a salad and I knew she'd try to give me salad if I looked at it.  The bruschetta was served in a huge glass serving dish. It was different. I didn't mind. The tiramisu was delicious No complaints! We will definitely return!",

The decor is interesting but the amusement wore off quickly.  After 15-20 minutes of being ignored we flagged down a waitress who had the table next to us.  She told us she didn't see us.  We were quite disappointed because we had gift cards and sure they would not refund the money on them.  So we are there.  Portions are large but each item in the menu is $20+.  Everything is al a carte.  Food was ok but the pizza although tasty but the crust was soggy in the middle. Then we went to pay and their computer is down and another wait.  From our experience might want to pass on the restaurant.  Did notice they cater to to groups celebrating birthdays and such.",

Hostess looks at the tables and say maybe another hour to hour and a half? WtF? When were they going to say some while we stood there holding a toddler and entertaining a 4 year old assuring them we'll be seated soon? How stupid or inconsiderate can someone be? They were going to let me stand up in front of them and hold a child for 2 hours before being seated? I wish nothing but the worst to that front of house staff and this location.

They totally helped being open especially in Vegas for out of town family, and families large enough but small enough - to not have any dishes at home to wash on this special holiday.  Reservations made through Open Table.  Dionna, our server, was quick on her feet and patient.  She repeated our order after ordering.  For an evening such as this, it's deserving of the servers to get a little more tip - especially if they were accomodating... And still offered dessert even though diners know one can feel like a stuffed turkey eating here.  As with my SoCal review, we can never get away from having their spaghetti and meatballs.  This never fails.  Although we do think about another type of pasta, discuss it a few seconds; the result is still their spaghetti with meatballs bigger than the size of a tennis ball.    But we did throw in something we hadn't yet tried- their stuffed chicken parmigiana.  Lesson: if having stuffed chicken parmigiana, omit ordering any appetizers.  You'll be satisfied with their warm bread and olive oil.    Unless your a professional food scarfer, and for whatever reason you have that extra expandable stomach with a hunger switch that takes forever to shut off.  By all means, eat and be merry!",

This time got the large penne ala vodka and cannolis (IDK if I spelled it right.) This review might be biased because I am NYC and im not a food snob, I guess, it just that the food is not that much better than olive garden. First the penne. The sauce was not as creamy as I thought it should, it was thick. Also, it was very peppery (Pepper flakes). I know what you are thinking, I have a sensitive pallet. I don't. I actually stopped eating spicy foods because the only way I could tell if something is spicy, is if I start to sweat. As I was eating it I asked my wife if it were spicy because I was sweating, she took 3 bites and could not eat it because of how spicy it was. I ate it and all the left overs, because it wasn't gross, just boring. And for 33 bucks for a large pasta to be boring kind of sucks. Now, the cannolis. They were good no complaints about the taste, but, they only filled the edges of the shells with the cream. I understand they give out 3 cannolis and they need to not waste the money, but, give me 2 cannolis completely filled and please maybe cut out some of the chocolate sauce drizzle. Like I said, this review could be biased because I lived in NYC before coming here and the crappiest Italian food there is better then the food I had here.",

Back then we thought the pricing was a little high for the amount of food you get. Just went back and realized the prices have gone up about $5 an entree which is family style. But the portion sizes haven't gotten bigger. The stuffed prosciutto chicken is hardly stuffed with anything and it was dry as a bone. I'm beginning to think the prices were raised to sort of offset the $10 coupon that you can get quite frequently. Example of over pricing. $39.99 for large chianti braised short ribs. The are good, but you get 3 small pieces to share with your family.  Same goes for all the meat entrees. The pasta, salad and pizza are good and that's what we will stick to. I want to give it 1 or 2 stars for the pricing.",

Food was excellent. Because of the length of the reception the main dishes had cooled slightly when they brought them out but that did not dampen our spirits at all. Drinks were good -- I got a few cocktails but they were mostly gingler ale and not much Whiskey. But all in all, I think they hosted our group really well.",

The chicken alfredo is soo delicious and creamy, the chicken is cooked so well and the the sauce is a classic. The Chicken parm comes in a big dish of 4 well sized chicken breasts and tastes better then it looks! We get the pasta marinera to eat with the chicken parm because it does not come with any pasta.  I have not had any desserts at this restaurant but I have heard that they are also very yummy!   Come with a starving belly and leave full and happy!

Ordered a large shrimp parmigiana figuring we'd have left overs to take home. It's supposed to feed up to 5 people. Barely enough for 2. Ordered iced tea as our beverage. No ice in them. Had to wait a long time to get refills on them or a glass of ice to make the tea cold. In fact, we had to wait a long time for EVERYTHING. Tre was far from attentive and as slow as a turtle. He was close to nonexistent service wise. The shrimp in the dish were overcooked and fried WAY too long. 75% were very brown from overcooking. Buca uses a lot of sauce to cover up this problem and hopes that the guests don't notice it. Parmigiana cheese on the dish? Nope. Barely there. Not an enjoyable meal. Need to reconsider dining here again. Didn't get a lot for the money we spent. 2 thumbs down for this place.",

The stuff was very nice and felt bad about it so they managed to set us the VIP round table with the Lazy Susan and the Pop (that was funny, in light of the fact we are Jewish :-D) The resturant is very unique with its decor, no bare wall left - but this makes it special We took the Thanksgiving menu which was surprisingly great! They managed to cook the turkey so well it was very good and not dry at all! We also had the Apple Gorgonzola Salad, which was delicious. The Pumpkin pie dessert was good!",

It was nice but WAY OVER DONE on the decor. I don't think they've heard of \"less is better\". The center of the table had a creepy statue of the pope.  Food wasn't too amazing in my opinion and I'll head over to Nora's for Italian food. The chicken we got was bland and they probably assumed the lemon sauce would do all the seasoning or something. The Alfredo was just ok, again bland and not enough sauce. Wished it was more rich and creamy. I didn't try anyone else's dishes but I didn't hear anyone say that they were good nor bad. I know none of us walked out saying how amazing it was and we'll have to come back. That's because we probably won't. Service is the only reason they get two stars. Our guy handled our party well and kept us happy on refills and bread. He was professional and upbeat!",

We love coming here of course our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, and we order way too much, but then take home is a good way to get to eat more goodness the next day!  We love the sauage and mushroom pizza and they have taken it off the menu, but we always ask for it and they always make it for us anyway, that's one way to keep us happy!  The service is another, always excellent, very quick with the refills, we are never waiting for attention.  After several visits, and ordering too many dishes, we have learned that we are good with one pasta and one pizza, taking home a lot of it, because we always save room for desert  This place is great for special occasions, with you and your best friend, or a group of friends, the atmosphere is loaded with good food, good fun and if you with someone special good company!",

The waiter was not attentive, our food was cold, and when asking for a manager, he never got us one. However, he claimed he did. The story is too long, but because of a wonderful assistant general manager, she took the time to make everything right for our following visit. Honestly, I hadn't planned on returning.Our recent visit from July 13, 2017 was extraordinary. The two key people that changed our opinion of Buca di Beppo was   Vicki Banusevich and Fallon Natolitani.  We had impeccable service as well as wonderful food.Thank you for having a caring staff.

My brother was incredibly happy with the decision, and the service and hospitality of the staff and the manager, Linda was impeccable! Of course I'm not taking about Buca... I'm talking about Grape Vine!  I'd give this restaurant no stars if I had the choice. We arrived at Buca for our reservation for a party of 17, for my brothers 21st birthday. The server took 20 minutes before she even came over to take a drink order, then when taking my brothers order, refused to sell him liquor. We thought it was a joke, until she explained that their new \"company policy\" was that they can't serve liquor to anyone with a vertical ID. His ID is 2 weeks old, brand new, government issued ID. She had the manager come over after we complained about this policy and how ridiculous it was. She then told us that she will not serve him alcohol, regardless of his birthday or his ID, and told us that if we gave him a drink, they'd kick our party out of the restaurant. Unbelievable. And to top it off, the server walked passed our table three times, over the course of 15 minutes before coming back to us, and all she asked was \"so what are you going to do?\" At that point, we got up and left.  Will never return to this location, let alone this chain.   My recommendation? Go down the street to Grape Vine!",

The staff shows first timers the kitchen by walking them through it. They sing happy birthday holding a candelabra at your table. The restaurant has family pictures and vintage Italian items all over the walls. This is a family style Italian restaurant as the portions are large.  On this recent visit, I shared some of my favorite items at this restaurant with a friend. If you like salads that have fruit and nuts in them try the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It has Granny Smith apples, walnuts, dried cranberries, and Gorgonzola tossed with Italian vinaigrette. We also had the Mozzarella Caprese. The tomatoes were very good and the mozzarella was fresh. I loved the basil olive oil on top.  The Eggplant Parmigiana for an entree was a hit with me! The eggplant is not too thick or thinly cut. It is topped with basil and mozzarella in addition to marinara sauce.  I don't usually have the offering of red wine, but I was talked into the Allegrini Veronese with my meal. Excellent choice.

We were seated and waited an extremely long time to even see our server. Although we were ready to order our server took only our drink order and ran away to put in our drink order. Our drink order was simply a bottle of wine. We didn't see her again to place our order for another 5 minutes.   So we order the lasagna with garlic bread and soup. The soup arrives just barely warm with the complementary bread which wasn't even warm.   Finished the soup and started waiting for the meal. Oh did I mention the wine still had not arrived. I guess the bar was backed up oh wait it was a bottle of wine.   I try not to completely judge a place based on one server. So the food arrived and it was bland.   Food wasn't great and bad service but that could be a one time thing but on the way out in the foyer there were two employees across from each other having a discussion. We passed between them and out the doors. They simply continued their discussion without so much as acknowledging the departing customers.   So it wasn't and individual server having a bad night. This is obviously poor management.",

Unless the service personnel is rearranged. Front desk personnel were great. The waiters on the other hand are by far the most unprofessional unproductive in their field. Only reason we didn't get up and leave, was because I had lots of family members already sitting at the table and it would have been hard to book somewhere else for a big party like that on last minute notice. So we tried to make it as good as possible,, BECAUSE IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But no matter what, these people were just not there. A few of my family members complained to me about how rude and careless they felt the waiters were. Even with my really bad dinner experience at this place, waiters still received a very generous tip,, not because they deserved it, but because we do what's right. Will not recommend nor take someone to eat here. Poor management.",

    "text": "This was not our first experience at a Buca's here in Vegas.  We used to patronize the location on E. Flamingo & Paradise, but we moved to NW side of town about a year ago. Eaten here numerous times, always giving this location \"another chance.\"  We shall find a different location now.  Over the past year, the service has gotten ridiculously slower, due to under staffing of servers and who knows what else. One occasion we were seated in the bar, one of two occupied tables with no patrons sitting  at the bar. The bartender/server (I want to say her name was Sherry) was VERY slow to take our drink orders.  The food took almost an hour to to arrive, and all we ordered was cheese garlic bread, ravioli, and lasagna.  Unfortunately on a subsequent visit, we were seated there a second time and immediately asked to be moved.  The service in the main dining area wasn't much better either, and the food took quite a long time again.  We've had Mike as a server a few times, and he's pretty good.  But he can't work miracles when he has too many tables to take care of due to management not staffing enough servers, and when the back of the house seems to think that \"slower than molasses in January\" is an acceptable speed to cook food.  Each visit the food has gotten more and more bland, with little to no flavor, and barely warm  (it's never HOT). Recently we ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was so bland and meatballs weren't cooked all the way through.  We had a new, female server that we had never seen before (a younger, shorter blonde), and she seemed to be quite overwhelmed due to having too many tables spread out all over the restaurant.  The parking situation is very awkward.  You have to walk quite a long way to get to the front door of the restaurant, which faces Lake Mead.  Perhaps when constructing future locations, please keep this in mind, as older patrons don't like to walk that far, especially to a dark, improperly lit lot.  I have read all of the reviews from he past two years, and it seems many echo the same sentiments of bland food and slow service.  I notice that someone who monitors the Yelp reviews almost always replies with some sort of canned answer, and sometimes includes that \"... a member of the management team will contact you.\"  I'd be curious to know if they actually did so, and what the outcome was.  I have yet to see anyone update their reviews if someone did contact them.  I, for one, am tired of reading the same old song and dance of \"We're sorry, but..., and...\"  No, you're not.  Whoever is typing the replies could probably care less.  How do I know?  Because there's too many negative reviews over the past year!  That can only mean one thing: that corporate management has done little to NOTHING to address the issues at this problematic location.  It's all about money, folks.  And Buca Di Beppo HAS to send out all those coupons, because they are slowly but surely driving their company into the ground.  It's a shame, too, because about 15 years ago, Buca Di Beppo was a great place to eat here in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Confession: I have NEVER cooked a turkey and I don't want to. Too freakin' big and it's too much work. I already make Thanksgiving breakfast so I have a pass when it comes to the turkey. So, Buca it is and they have never failed me. They always work with my request on substituting the sides for more mashed potatoes which is a big factor why I order our dinner here every year. I also called Thanksgiving morning to change my order from half pans to full and that wasn't a problem. Found out last minute that we'd have more guest than expected.   Out of all the restaurants that we've tried in the past for our turkey, this has been the most liked by our family and this year so did our guests. We like white gravy on our turkey instead of brown so I just use the gravy from the country fried steak I made for breakfast.   We are not crazy for stuffing but we like Buca's. Thanksgiving just wouldn't be complete without it anymore. I think I'll make a reservation to eat there next year.   We got 4 boxes of pumpkin pies with our feast. I gave 2 boxes of them to my brother to take home since his kids liked it so much. By Friday morning, mine was all gone!  The bread was sooo soft and creamy. It was all gone when I woke up Friday morning. I was looking forward to having some with butter :-/  Mashed potatoes basically is loved in this household as much as we love rice. So yes, overall nothing was wasted.   It's pricey... but there were 15 of us and we had it for breakfast and lunch too for Friday :-)",

I went in a week prior and made the reservation and had a couple requests. Lindsay did a remarkable with meeting those requests. One being the way we wanted the seating arrangements for our party. Next, our reservation was at 4:30 and we were seated on time. Our waiters were Michael and Luis. These two gentleman were awesome and were on top of every little thing. Michael thoroughly went over the order with us as we gave them a preorder for our dinner. He told us what dishes might be to much and what other dishes we may need. Our order was perfect with plenty of leftovers. If you have a large party, this is definitely the place you want to go! I would certainly request these great individuals as all of them did an amazing job and deserve to be recognized.",

It was relatively empty at the time we came in, which was around 5 p.m. The location is relatively easy to get to, off of the 95/lake mead. Its on the west side of the 95 a few blocks away. Buca has a private parking lot, shared with office space nearby and next to the InTouch Credit Union. Inside the restaurant is absolutely stunning. Its authentic with the Italian style. We were immediately provided a table and the server came over offering drinks. My friend and I did not have an appetizer, but she did get one of their blended new wines on the house. We ended up ordering small plates of the chicken stuffed prosciutto, the stuffed shells, and the brocolli. The chicken and shells were awesome, but the broccoli, yuck. They had put too much red flakes on the broccoli which made it pretty inedible. I would not recommend getting their brocolli dish. I ordered a cheesecake to go. Overall experience was great. Server was awesome and I would go here again for large portion italian styled food.",

For the main course we had spaghetti with meatballs, spicy chicken rigatoni, Chicken Marsala and Short Rib Orecchiette.  Drinks included strawberry lemonade and Stella Artois.  What was good ?- tomato sauce with Calamari was light and flavorful, but Calamari was chewy.  We could not drink the lemonade, it was horrible.  Mac and Cheese balls were tasteless. Spicy shrimp was passable at best.  Spaghetti with sauce was generic, meatballs were huge, but lacked any flavor. Chicken rigatoni had some flavor, but the chicken pieces were chewy.  Short ribs were bad, should have been cooked with some mushroom etc soup base and stock, they were tasteless. It felt that she dish was not cohesive and someone just threw few things together.  Chicken Marsala should have been in the Dessert Menu, it was cloyingly sweet for an entree. Chicken was cooked well and was juicy. Needless to say, my first and last visit to this restaurant.",

Short Hispanic male, short hair, glasses, chubby, and loves to hang out and socialize with his staff members outside by the dumpsters while smoking cigarettes.  Our 4 top, 2 adults- 2 kids, sat down at our table around 630p... we did not get our entrees until 815p. These long ass wait times and the fact that they could not start our kids meals first, like we asked, and instead made our 4 and 2yo wait over an hour for their food, while continuously trying to bring more bread to our table, even though we refused every time and asked for our kids food- was enough to show us that this place is run like a sht show when this manager is working.  We visited the Buca location off of east flamingo several years ago and this latest visit was a clear reminder of why we have not been back to this restaurant in so long.   As 12 year Las Vegas locals, we will never be back to this establishment ever again.   Their Yelp! rating says all you need to know. Every location you go to is the same rating or worse. Time for these owners to wake up and make some changes.",

So you might be thinking  why did I only give it 3 stars? Well the waitress was not pleasant at all , the overall atmosphere is up beat and she was a drag. I find it interesting that in such a family fun atmosphere someone  so dull could work there ( not sure if that was the right there , or is it their ). It's a shame I feel like she kinda kept stomping on our tables mood.   Well to recap food good server we had mood killer. Definitely worth a try.",

My husband and I went back a couple weeks later for lunch, and we enjoyed ourselves once again! I was definitely a fan!!! My third visit, I brought a girlfriend with me! I kept raving about this place to her. The service was the worst yet!!!! Our server was awful. Some people just aren't cut to be servers. She never refilled our waters, she didn't bring the oil and vinegar for our bread, and when we mentioned that our dessert we ordered was still frozen, instead of offering us something else, she only offered a to-go box to take it home and eat it later. I haven't been back since this visit which was in November. The food is good and consistent, and I hope I have the courage to return. I may just order to-go.

It looks and tastes the same but the prices were inflated,  portions small and ingredients skimpy.   We went on a Friday night and the place was maybe a quarter occupied. Used to be jam packed with a wait on a weekend night.   The 3 of us ordered the smaller sizes of one appetizer, one salad, one main pasta dish, and one drink. Plus tax and tip = $75 = totally not worth it!  The bread they brought out was half a loaf of some lame ass generic 50 cent roll. They used to serve at least two different kinds of specialty bread. The marinara sauce served with the fried calamari was watery and served in a tiny cup. The chopped antipasto salad used to be full of olives, peppercinis, and large slices of meats and cheeses; it was mostly lettuce this time. The frutti di mare linguini used to be made with generous amounts of seafood; it was very soupy and contained so little of everything this time.  Again, the decor was still fun and the taste was the same, but we were extremely disappointed with every other aspect. They even went cheap on the napkins.  Buca went from being a basement in name only to just plain basement quality. We'll never go back again.",

Then our bill was .06 cents short for the $40 total required for our coupon and they wouldn't accept it or give us any alternative (like add something very small to our total to push it over $40).  I'm sure we'll try it one more time but cautiously ... hope this was just a fluke and not a new normal.",

Entering the restaurant, I was suddenly in an Italian mama's home with checkered covered tables and walls covered with wonderful vintage photos of Italian celebrities and Italian-themed movies and shows. To save money, the four of us ate family-style. We ordered one dish, shrimp fra diavolo, large enough to feed 3 people. It came to the table in a jumbo serving bowl. We dug in and found it to be absolutely delicious. I loved the layers of flavors - the garlic, the tomatoes, the spice from the crushed red peppers... The food tasted more like home-cooking than from a franchise restaurant. Although our party comprised 3 women and one guy, we couldn't finish it all and took home about 2-3 cups of food. This place is a great food find. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Buca di Beppo is a great place especially if you have larger parties and the pasta is delicious! We ordered chicken carbonara (pictured here) as well as the shrimp Florentine and chicken limone. We also ordered a trio appetizer with calamari, spinach dip and fried Mac and cheese balls(couldn't get a picture because we ate it so fast!) the appetizers were delicious as well as all the food, it was so much we had enough leftovers for two more meals! The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the lack of service. Our waitress was kind and very attentive to our needs but, the food took a while to come out and it seemed like they were understaffed. Possibly because we came in towards closing but still seemed like they could have used more workers to help out with the tables that were there. All in all, Buca di Beppo is on my top places to take my family for an Italian night out, it's affordable and there's so much food!",

My husband and I came here on his birthday, and we had a huge feast to ourselves. We ordered the small lasagna and the small shrimp fra diavolo. Safe to say we underestimated how much food would be served to us. I think what we ordered could have fed a total of 5 or 6 people. We just took home the leftovers because the food is extremely yummy anyways.  Lasagna (4.5/5): This is a must when I come to Buca. The lasagna is so rich and delicious. The small size can feed like 5 people, so make sure you come with a big party.  Shrimp fra diavolo (4/5): This dish is so yummy. The shrimp is plump and juicy while the sauce on the pasta is nice and spicy!  What makes this location stand out is the server who helped us. I forgot her name but man, she was so friendly and attentive. She checked up a lot on us and refilled our bread and drinks so many times. We had a great experience there and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "So I have gone to this location about four times now and it seems like everytime we go it gets worse. This recent experience will be the last time I go to this location. When we arrived around 4pm we walked into an empty waiting area and there was no one then about a few minutes later the hostesses showed up and ask \"how many?\" we just us two, then the hostess says \"it will be about 10-15 minutes....\" I was like for two people? Are you all that busy and packed? They couldnt really give us an answer. So we sat and waited about 4 minutes, so we were like ok this is ok they are quick. Then as we were walking to being seated in an area away from everyone else except another lonely couple. A waitress standing there says \"Why are you all sitting people in this area when no one has this area yet....\" Made us be hesitate to stay and eat, then after about 20 minutes of watching waiters and waitresses walking about and no one stopped and asked us for drink or anything, then we were like we were going to wait 5 more mins. Then finally a waitress came out and asked if we had a drink order, we said no one has waited on us. She did apologize, she was also training a new employee. So then we got our drinks about 35-40 minutes we finally get to order food, which we already had decided when we got a our drink order. Then the rest of the evening was short and felt like we were left alone the food tasted good, but the service was very slow, for a slow night, and it seems like there was not much supervising going on with staff. I always like to give restaurants the benefit of improving but this location disappointments me again so I will not be returning and going to the other locations where the service is better and not felt like an outcast while we were dining.",

    "text": "Hubby didn't like the food very much the last time we had food from the original location at Restaurant Row (due to the marinara sauce changing, much sweeter).  But it was a different story here, for yesterday's lunch visit. We both had sandwiches- mona panini & smash meatball burger (split it- always been our thing) and our son had a kid's meal (for 10 and younger) @ $4.99, pepperoni pizza- it was huge! Six choices, the others were: mac & cheese, spaghetti w/ meatball, fettucine alfredo, cheese pizza, and chicken parmigiana. Total was $25.41.   I had a gift card to use. We also checked the menu online. I called to make sure that they were open so I called and got a live person. Yes, we did our homework. (On a past holiday we found out the hard way that the restaurant was closed.)  Jessica was our server. She was quick, attentive and very nice. She checked in on us numerous times. And she asked us frequently if we were good or if we needed anything else. She also offered to sign up my husband because it seemed like he was bumped off of the email list. Not many other customers which was a surprise. Not that we were complaining, because our food was prepared pretty quickly.   We started off with yummy bread with the oil, balsamic vinegar & herb combo. I had to stop myself or else I wouldn't be hungry for my lunch. The mona panini was delish. All of the flavors really worked together. And the bun was a good size, not too much bread, just enough.  The meatball sandwich was really good too. I liked them both but maybe the panini edged out the meatball sandwich just a smidge. The garlic fries were perfect, crisp, with just enough seasoning. Not greasy or mushy, I don't like that.   You can say that this visit renewed our interest in this restaurant.",

Enjoyed the salad and fruitti di late as well as the double chocolate cake.   The complimentary bread was good and filling and was paired with the olive oil and pepper.  Loved the set up with the lit candles to blow out for the birthday celebrant.  The staff goes out of their way to make your party feel special.  Excellent food and service.

    "text": "We made reservations at this location for our party of 15 on a Sunday night hoping that it wouldn't be as crazy as either of the Strip locations. We made the correct decision. Buca's food and service has always been consistent for us.   We had a 7 PM reservation and were seated immediately. They originally had us at two separate tables, but with 6 kids under the age of 12, we were able to squeeze comfortably into one large table. This made things more intimate, and I picked a middle spot at the table and was still able to converse with everyone around the table, including my 3 year old nephew.  One server tackled our entire party, and she did a great job. There was somewhat of an extended wait for the entrees to come out, but none of us minded because it gave everyone a chance to catch up and we had some appetizers and salad already.  Food: Fried mozzarella, fried calamari, apple gorgonzola salad, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, and the colossal brownie sundae. I like the lasagna, the portion is huge, but we had enough people to finish it off.  My wife and I enjoy the apple gorgonzola salad especially. It has a little bit of everything but is balanced: sweet, tart, crunchy, bitter, and salty. I would definitely recommend the salad.  Because we get the same, enjoyable food and service every time, and because it's a great place for our whole family to get together, we have yet to find any reason to stop coming here.",

We then got a gift card and went back to use it.  We got the \"make your own pasta\" with garlic oil sauce, mushrooms, broccoli and sauteed onions to go.  We asked for meatballs on the side.  Our order included meatballs on  top of the pasta with red bell pepper.  We told them the order was incorrect.  They took it back and clearly picked out the meatballs and put them in a to go box.  They left the red peppers.  This was obvious because it took them 3 min to fix the problem.  The staff was not apologetic and clearly rushed the order the second time to get us out the door.     Also, we called in the order and they told us it would take 20 min.  We arrived to pick up our dinner 20 mins later.  It was not ready.  We waited another 20 mins...then it was wrong.  All of this shows us that BDB doesn't take pride in their customer service to rectify mistakes.  Since the quality of food is not that good, expensive for what you get and this mistake....we won't go back.",

    "text": "This is only the second time we have been to this location since they went corporate. Not very impressive honestly.  Since they went corporate, the food portions have DEFINITELY gotten smaller, the large would feed ~3 normal people so it's still pretty decent x Pasta was a bit rubbery but they actually put a decent amount of sauce now!  We got here around 9pm and our server started us off with one loaf of bread. The bread is actually one of the main reasons we even come here! We were told (after asking for a refill) that they were baking some in the oven and so we eagerly waited. That was around 9:30pm  We asked for the check at 10:15pm  And that's when our server realized he still had not gotten our bread refilled.  It's almost been an hour at this point, I'm pretty sure bread doesn't take that long to bake and it irritated me, but my husband calmed me down and told me that he was probably just busy and had forgotten.  But honestly? It was not that busy at all.  Most of the employees were already putting away tables and it seemed like everyone was already in a rush to go home even though they didn't close for another hour.  Our waiter came back and told us that they have just simply run out of bread! (this is after we asked him once again, mind you. He did not even have the decency to tell us as soon as he found out)  Well. I mean, it IS just bread.  So it really would not have been a big deal at all if we were told in the beginning, but it's just infuriating to feel like you're paying good money to get barely decent service.  Like honestly? I bet that there WAS bread that was baking, he forgot about us because we are a younger couple, by the time he realized MAYBE they did run out of bread (but there was definitely some left when we first asked)  OR since we had to ask for a third time after paying MAYBE he forgot once again and was too lazy/couldn't be bothered to go grab some???  My husband was feeling very good (we were celebrating our valentines early as we hate the crowds) and so he kept going on and on about leaving a good tip (he's extra generous when he's happy) We left a 10% tip in the end because we understand that most of the money the servers make is through tips (we don't like to fck anyone over something petty, but we just felt so very offended as we were not even given BASIC customer service)  Also, I just have to say (because it just seems so ridiculous) they stop baking bread at 9:30pm??? When they close at 11pm???  That's very strange.  We only got 1 refill (we had to ask) for the ice tea during our hour long visit (so much ice, it was literally 3 sips, like???)  It took longer then 10min for the server to collect the payment.  We didn't even get a bag. My husband carried the container in his hand and even as we walked out NOT ONE PERSON offered a bag. (just seems like the thing to do as an employee dedicated to providing excellent customer service, no?)  EDIT:  Also, the way he talked to us at the end was beyond infuriating.  As we collected the check we had to ASK ONCE AGAIN what's happening with the bread (that god damn bread, man)  WHY could he not just say something like \"I'm so sorry, it seems we've run out of bread. So sorry for the inconvenience\"  Then we could have been like Nah, it's cool. It's just bread (I literally feel like pulling my hair out)  He was just like \"oh yeah man. there's no bread, we ran out or something\"  And my husband is just confused and asked him why he told us they were baking some more if they weren't  He's just like \"yeah, I don't know man. I guess not.\" (what the actual hell???)  It was actually kind of insulting how he was talking to us.  His tone of voice suggested that he was tired of us and just wanted us to go away.  Sorry. I tried to be nice when I wrote this last night but damn man. It's kind of hard to write a nice review about someone who made your blood boil.  Honestly wish I didn't tip at all.  Oh. I might only have 2 check-ins here, but we have been coming semi-regularly to this location since 2012 (1-2x every other month) and I just have to say that the new woman manager (or whatever she is) is also rude as hell x  There was a situation that happened on our last visit and after a few calls to corporate, the manager apologized. I'm sure she was forced to do so because she sure as hell wasn't very nice when she was \"apologizing\" to my mother-in-law.  I originally gave it a 3 star rating because this was our first date spot and I didn't want to sully that memory (this place used to be special to us) but wow.  Sorry, but forget that.  BEING THERE and getting that HORRID customer service is what really ruins that place of nostalgia.  Taking it down to 1 star because I sure as hell won't be coming back.",

    "text": "First time here... And boy do I feel awful giving out people giftcards to this place.... So not impressed!  Firstly, we waited about 10 mins before our server came. We never got utensils since they were still 'folding' them.... I personally had to steal them from an empty table.  We ordered the cheesy bread with spinach and tomatoes, Apple gorzongola salad and baked ziti. Also got a wine... They didn't have Fizz 56 which I wanted to try so I ended up settling for white zin (15 min process to find out that this wine didn't exist today... Although my husband's beer came out quickly).   Don't buy the cheesy bread. It is seriously the same as the other bread with a crap ton of cheese... Barely any spinach or tomatoes.  The salad was ok. Not as good as described.   The baked ziti wasn't as good as anything we have eaten from Olive Garden. It was ok, but not great.  Our server was undeniably slow, although she was quite nice when she came by (Sheri). Had to ask the bus boy for water, and never received a refill (she never came by until the check). So whatever. First and last time at this place!  Will not be returning. Ever. Seriously, Olive Garden is a million steps up from this place!!  When we left the hostess was even too busy texting to say THANK YOU. Take your business elsewhere!",

    "text": "We visited on National Pasta Day, expected huge crowds but it wasn't that busy - I thought that may have been a warning... Usually we visit this location twice a year or so but sadly this was our LAST visit for various reasons. First off, and to be totally fair --our server was great! He ran his tail off trying to keep the ball rolling but he was the sole server for the entire back of the house; large parties with one server running around is poor management to say the least. We  had reservations, but had to wait while the front desk/greeter helped parties without reservations first. Whatever happened to, \"Who has reservations? Please step forward and I'll seat you asap!\" When we did get to our table, the oil and balsamic vinegar was already on the plate, how long had that been there? In addition, two pieces of Lego-type toys along with a dirty fork were on my placemat - lovely! We waited forever for bread and it arrived at the same temperature as the unspreadable butter: cold! The food did taste good but it took forever to get it to our table and upon finishing our meal the leftovers sat far too long before finally being boxed up for us. I seriously doubt the safety of our leftovers as they sat for far too long. Therefore, due to all the experiences listed,we will not be visiting again - the two stars in this review are for our server - he tried his hardest and did his best but he was spread far too thin to take care of so many tables.",

Also ordered the calamari but it wasn't earth shattering..I'd probably skip it next time.  Server was great and very helpful.  Atmosphere is very \"homey\" and has a classic feel.

Next, the food orders were delivered to the wrong table and so my husband's dish arrived at least 10-15 minutes before mine. All in all, a very poor experience.

This place has almost a nostalgic feel to it in the fact that there are lots of large family sized tables filled to the brim with generations of families dining and laughing. The restaurant itself is decorated with old Italian decor and has a real homey feel to it.  Now, my view may be a little skewed because I was here on a first date and it ended up being one of the best dates I've ever been on. This may have made the food taste better but in reality it was pretty damn good food at a reasonable price. I didn't realize that the \"regular\" portion was for 2+ people and was a bit worried at ordering a $20 Veal Parmigiana. The meal came with 3 large Veal pieces all smothered in tasty sauce, cheese, and wrapped in prosciutto.  With a fantastic atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, and delicious Italian food, Buca di Beppo now has a great place in my heart. Can't wait to have a family outing here one day with my less than Italian family.",

The decor of this place is really cool.  I always like dim lit places.  There were about 25 of us, but they were very accommodating.  The food was very good.  For a franchise place they had some good stuff.  What really stood out was the chicken saltimbocca it was probably the biggest hit at the table.  I will be back for that dish.  The whole night was great they really did a great job with everything.",

Several of us called ahead to place orders to help assist the kitchen from falling behind.  I am glad we did because those who didn't seemed to have to wait a while for their orders to be taken. Other than that, knowing they were going to have a large party you would hope they would have planned ahead.  We had 1 main server and 1-2 others helping him when they seemed to have a minute.  I would have thought they would have planned ahead to have 2-3 people for such a large group. Our poor server tried but he just seemed miserable the entire time. Yes, it was loud and chaotic due to having a large group of children running around but the kids were going crazy after waiting over a hour for food.  As for drink refills they were no existent.  I had asked 2 times before my water was refilled..and those extra napkins never showed either.   The food itself was just okay.  Nothing that made me say wow I have to have this again.  Would I eat here again, maybe.  Would I select this place or recommend as a must try...no.",

When I placed the pre-order it took my discount 10% off and rejected my $10 gift card saying the numbers were incorrect! I figured when I checked the box \"pay in restaurant\" I can straighten out my gift card with manager. I didn't realize I got charged already!  I went in on 12/31st gave my prnit out of my online order to Cindy who was very nice and helpful. The manager came honored my gift card for $10! I was happy! Food was good bit on the pricey side but it is new year we are celebrating. When I checked my account I noticed I was charged for my online order and also when I picked up my order:( I called back talk to Cindy who said it is only pending they voided that online order so it should be okay now. Well, it is not okay both was charged and Joe the manager suppose yo call me back yesterday but didn't.  My husband and I drove to Buca di Pepo Summerlin asking for the manager Joe he wasn't in. Zack the other manager was in but he couldn't d anything except told me he has to get in touch with GM and Corporate to resolve my issues! WHAAAT? The double charge is on there computer clearly I have my bank statement printed out showing the charges what is the problem? Joe manager called me back at 3:00pm found my online order on his computer sending it into corporate to get my credit it may take 3-5 business days?? Buca di Pepo has my $60.37 since 12/31 4 days now and they let me wait another 3-5 business days??? Lousy customer service, bad website, after several phone call and personal appearance  I'm super disappointed by the lack of decision making of the managers at Buca! Walmart gives me my money back the same day I expected a much better service from a HIGH END restaurant like Buca di Pepo! Who knows how long before I see my money back to my credit card???Shame on you!",

I had to call the day of and move them 30 minutes, they were very accommodating and change it.  I had only been here once before in SLC, so I asked our server what we would be best. She made some wonderful suggestions. We were a party of 9, we ordered a small antipasti salad, a large margarita pizza and spicy chicken rigatoni.     Our drinks came out in a timely manner, followed by the salad which could have fed everyone. They then brought the pizza and pasta at the same time. All the food was delicious, and service was great!  For dessert we order a chocolate brownie sundae which easily fed all of us, I believe we ended up leaving some.    Our server was absolutely awesome, I believe her name was Ashley.    My only complaint is halfway through our meal, they were cleaning up the floor in the section behind us, and it was annoying hearing the broom and dustpan for about 10 minutes behind me. Also wondering how much dust was being stirred up around my food. With all the decorations, its a bit dusty.",

Still frozen. They sang the b-day song , fine. No issues. But the manager barged in swooped up the still dripping candles off the table ,saying there are lots of birthdays today. What, do they only have one set? And, the candles were about 1/2inch big. Do they have a candle shortage. Not well organized. Food was tasty.  Update: Person from company reached out to me.

I only rated our visit 4 stars, because of the laspe in time it took to make our visit right.  The expediter was phenomenal as well!

    "text": "We have stayed away from Buca di Beppo because of their reputation for huge portions.  We would be in the area for an appointment and decided to go here after for an early dinner.  As form the portions, we're at the age where early dinners and take home boxes rule!  :)  I had checked the menu online and knew pretty much what we wanted before going there.  Our server, Casey, was a gem!  She asked us if we had been there before and answered questions and gave advice as we asked.  We ended up ordering a small portion of their summer tricolore salad.  It was a good starter of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and avocado rings topped with fresh basil and olive oil.  A very summery kind of salad.  For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.  The take home packaging even had a reheating instruction sticker on it.    Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.  I was very pleased with this first visit to a Buca.  Considering the amount of food, the price is reasonable.  Service was outstanding.  Thanks, Casey!  We'll be back to try some other things.  And, by bringing home a box, it saves me from having to cook a meal on a future day.  Score!",

    "text": "My sister and a friend are here a few years ago and both had good things to say. So we all decided to go together. My first visit.  The consensus:  very disappointing.  Ordered a salad, chicken dish and bowl of  fettuccini pasta. The chicken was made from a frozen breast and was a relatively tasteless dish. Also, not as large of a serving as I was told to expect from their \"family style\" menu.  The fettuccini Alfredo was also a small portion even though we ordered the \"large\" bowl size. The sauce tasted like canned Alfredo sauce and the dish was served like warm. Best part of the meal was the Apple Gorgonzola salad. I honestly could not recommend this restaurant and do not plan on returning.",

    "text": "This Italian chain restaurant serves all their dishes family style; a small usually feeds 2 people and a large 4. There were 6 of us, so we ordered 3 entrees. Mom and I ordered a small chicken limone, dad and grandma got the baked ziti with meatballs, and my bro and boyfriend got the penne al forno. We also ordered a caesar salad to share.    Our server brought us bread with oil and balsamic vinegar to start. The bread was yummy. Soft and warm on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I love to dip it in the balsamic/oil concoction. I ate way too much of this delicious bread. The salad came out shortly after and it was totally dry. We all agreed it needed more dressing so we asked for some on the side. The dressing was pretty bad. It's definitely from the bottle and we were all disappointed. Skip this and try a different salad.   It wasn't long before the entrees came out. The chicken limone was my favorite. It's chicken breast with capers in a lemon butter sauce. It's tangy and delicious. I think we should have ordered a large size, as the small was just 3 pieces and everyone wanted to try some. Dad and grams had a huge bowl of ziti, with 3 huge meatballs that were as big as my head. Okay I'm exaggerating, but they were pretty big. Sadly, they weren't very flavorful. The pasta was okay. It had fresh ricotta, and mozzarella cheeses with marinara sauce. I didn't try the other dish, but the boys seemed to like it. It was similar to the ziti, but had prosciutto, pepperoni and spicy sausage. We realized how similar the pasta dishes were and wished we would have ordered something else. Oh well, next time.   We had to have dessert, so we ordered the colossal sundae to share. It comes in a huge cup, with brownie pieces, 6 scoops of ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces, and whipped cream. I don't think there were really 6 scoops of ice cream, and the cup wasn't even filled all the way. We finished this easily.   For all of the food we ordered it was just about $100 for 6 of us, not including tip. Our server was slow. He kept forgetting to bring us water and other stuff we asked for throughout our dinner. I would say this place is a step above Olive Garden, but not somewhere I would run back to or recommend to anyone.",

Sadly we called the the restaurant and asked if we can exchange the pizza. The person on the other side knew which order it was. We arrived with an unfriendly staff. They argued with us stating that the pizza was cooked. If they cooked it any further it would burn.  The cheese wasn't even melted therefore  it was not cooked enough. We use to love going here and unfortunately we will take our business somewhere else. We decided on a refund.  Awful customer service.",

When it was finally my turn the lady running the area had on way to much perfume which covered the aroma of the food. I couldn't understand what she was saying. Before I could say anything she took off into the back. I was still needed to pay and was left standing there. Finally a manager asks if I was being help and took my payment.  By the time I got my food home ( five min drive) everything was cold. There was barely any sausage in the bake ziti. Not very happy with this experience when I have been going to same location since I was a kid with my family.",

Sure, it was somewhat humorous in a self-deprecating But-Hey-I'm-Italian-I-Can-Take-It sort of way. It was good for a few chuckles and made for an interesting walking tour room to room. It certainly was visually interesting.  The food was well done for every dish. Portions were generous, too. I can honestly find no fault (excepting the price) with the food. I'd eat their Lemon caper Chickens with Artichokes again without a doubt. And I thought the Sangria was subpar (I'd call it a red wine spritzer!).   I couldn't figure why water was seeping all over the table, until we noticed the glass has a crack from top to bottom. Yikes. And don't waste my time inspecting the glass at the table like a CSI detective. Just whisk the sucker away and apologize. I didn't crack it! So service is rather weak. And even though I ordered a drink, when I don't order a second, Don't Abandon My Table!  Food was better than anticipated, service was not. Borderline on a return.",

We used to love the food but this time the Chicken parmigiana was really bad. Every other time I had gotten it, the plate was so hot I couldn't touch it, the breading on the outside was super crispy, the sauce was thick and flavorful and the cheese was melty. this time the plate was barely warm, the chicken was barely warm, the breading was soggy, soft and had no crunchyness, the sauce on top was watery and was barely just chunks of tomatoes. I explained this to my waitress and she was super helpful, brought out another plate. This time the plate was hot, the chicken was hot and the breading was a little more crispy but it was nowhere near as crispy as it used to be and the sauce on top was still liquidy, thin, with chunks of tomatoes. This was a huge disappointment as Chicken parmigiana at Buca was my favorite thing to get, it seems that the recipe has changed and this has changed my decision to eat at Buca anymore. The service brought this from a 1 star review to a 2 star review.",

Bland is the only way I can describe the entire meal.  The marinara was terrible until I added salt and then VOILA! It was genius again.  The meatballs were the worst offenders of the bland bandits.  Not only were they full of NO flavor they were luke warm and smelled like canned dog food.  Worst thing on the table.  My husband ordered a new menu item that was laden in creme sauce and I can't remember the name of it because it was again, BORING!   Sorry to say but the meal sucked.  The service was wonderful and that is what bumps up this joint to 2 stars!",

It makes it really easy for a big family like that to order and be able to try a little bit of everything. The service was really good, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it was really cold in the restaurant, which may or may not have been the reason for the food coming out slightly cold and then also our order of gnocchi wasn't cooked all the way and was more of a dough ball, but it still tasted good :)",

    "text": "I was in the mood for garlic bread and fettuccine, so I went online and googled places to eat in vegas for italian food. Of course the hotel strip restaurants pop up first, but in a 10 best website, Bucca di Beppo was listed for Vegas as an off strip Italian place serving fantastic food.  I had to try it.  About 3 miles away from my apartment there is one, nestled in a corner with a bright neon sign that shows even in daylight. You pull up, expecting parking to be in front of the door, but theirs is located behind the building--meaning a walk to the entrance. I didn't understand why at first, but keep reading.  We walk in and the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the photos on the wall. There are literally hundreds depicting families, individuals, animals, holidays, sports--you name it, it's on the wall. The setting is classic Italian restaurant--the red cloth and the best part was the menus, which are the placemats. I love the convenience of it in case you want to order more. We decided on two classics--lasagna and fettucine alfredo. Since we arrived at lunchtime, we received free garlic bread with cheese. Their garlic bread is to DIE for, with real thin slices of garlic and fresh oregano and basil. It's fantastic and we ate two basketfuls before our appetizer showed up. We had their stuffed mushroom with proscuitto and mozzarella--a must try. It was creamy, salty sweet, and the bed of pesto cream sauce was incredible. After we devoured the sauce and mushrooms, our main courses came out.  If you've never been here, there are three ways to order: small, large, or \"mio\" which are individual portions for lunch. If there are two of you eating, try getting the mio sizes, because my boyfriend and I assumed that small would be just right, and we were dead wrong. For the price you pay, the portions are incredibly large. Their pasta and lasagna are beautifully presented on traditional plates, family style. At first I was hesitant to cut into anything because it looked so pretty. After taking a picture, we cut small slices of the nine layer lasagna and took a large portion of pasta each. From the small order of lasagna, we had more than half of it left over, and the small slice we did eat was an honest meal in itself! The waitress even asked us if we touched our pasta--that's how much you get.  As for taste, it's divine. Not only was the alfredo sauce creamy, thick, and decadent, but the pasta was cooked perfectly. As for the lasagna--if you are a lasagna person, this place is it! Thick noodles, layers of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and a tomato sauce that is to die for! It's sweet but balances with enough acidity, and the chunks of tomato in there are so good to just scoop and eat alone. We also ordered a 1/2 pound meatball, and I assumed that the sauce would be the same sauce as the lasagna. It's not. They have sauces for each specific dish and the meatball sauce was heaven! The meatball itself was so good that it was devoured in a minute, literally.  They gave us a free gelato cone which is small but after a meal like that, quite enough! I reccommend trying their pistachio and triple berry. It's yummy! For a price ticket of 60 dollars, this place is not only quite affordable for a party of four (yes that price is ordering food for 4-6 people), but for two people on a romantic date. I highly reccommend that you stop here and eat some great food if you haven't yet. It's worth every penny and definitely every bite.",

Buca is the only place in town that I know of that can keep it cheap, huge portions and allow us to get as loud as we want.    The waitstaff was good and kept on top of everything.  The food was typical Italian, nothing special, though my hubby loved the pizza and I loved the chicken parmagiana. The tiramisu leaves a lot to be desired. I won't order that again.  We fed 8 people, with liquor and dessert (no appetizer) and took the leftovers home for $110. I don't think you can beat the price.  Making a reservation seems to be a difficult task for them. I made it a month in advance, and I called back a week prior to the event to confirm it. Dominique said the reservation wasn't in the book, so she wrote it in. We got to Buca and while we were there, someone from Buca called my cell phone to tell me that because I was running late, they could only hold my reservation another 5 minutes.  It seems like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing!",
