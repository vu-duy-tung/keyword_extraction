Tables are covered with plastic and a roll of paper towel is your complimentary item, which you'll need.  This place is all about the food, from the time you eat til the time you leave the smell of garlic and spices will linger.  The spicy is really really spicy!         Your tools left hand/Right hand.  The object?  To Eat.      For 3 people: Medium 1lb of Shrimp 2 lbs of Crawfish Corn + Potato + Beverage  Oh so tasty.  Decor:4 Food:4 Service:4  Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!",

    "text": "I've only been to one other place like this and it was in Southern California. I don't think I can give this place 5 stars with a clear conscience because it probably isn't one of the best crab boil places out there. I haven't visited enough of them to truly judge.  That said, this place is pretty good. It's really nice if you want to catch a game or something because they have multiple tv screens set up in the restaurant.  You'll be eating with your hands so you don't have to focus any of your attention towards coordinating utensils with your food. Just peel and eat. I favor the shrimp, snow crab, and sausage. They also make pretty good cajun fires, made better when you dip them in the 'Hot N Juicy' sauce.  It's a fun, extremely casual, place to eat. It's impossible not to get messy, but the bib helps. Worth a visit.",

There were only 4 of us, but (I can't believe I am admitting this, but.. )I think we ate our way through 7 pounds of crawfish.    Heed the warnings below, the spicy is REALLY SPICY.  For those of you who like spicy food, the medium spicy is a huge step down, but your tastebuds will thank you in the end.",

    "text": "Okay, this review may be a little biased because I'm comparing my Hot and Juicy experience with Boiling Crab out in California, but really... Hot and Juicy?  NOT SO HOT AND JUICY!  My friend recommended this place because her cousin saw it on the Food Network.  I want to go to Food Network, tell them that they SUCK, that they should retract the special on Hot and Juicy, and that they should do a special on Boiling Crab instead.  Okay, maybe not as harsh.  - We all ordered the shrimp with the Medium Hot and Juicy Special sauce.  At BC, you can see the garlic, pepper, and the deep red sauce in the bag.  Also,  the Medium Whole Shabang has a spicy taste that lingers.   This is what I was expecting.  Instead, the shrimp at H&J came out super bland, not spicy, and not juicy at all.  I had to squish my shrimp around the barely-there sauce to get it to have any flavor at all.  - We had to ask for limes, salt, and pepper.  They took forever to get the limes out to us.  It was as if they went to go buy limes and cut them up just for us.  - You can't draw on the walls.  How wack is that? Haha.    The staff was friendly and the venue was clean, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I'm sorry H&J...  2 stars for you cuz: \"Meh.  I've definitely experienced better.\"",

    "text": "I saw this place on Food network and was surprised we have this famous Cajun restaurant here in Las Vegas. I decided to take my fiancee for a never-before crawfish experience.   We were there on Tuesday night about 8:00PM and there was plenty of open seating. After we were seated, we were given the first-timer instruction on how to order.   We ordered 2lbs of crawfish(hot & juicy mild) included 1 potato & 1 corn, 1 lb of shrimp (galic butter mild), 1 soft shell crab basket include Cajun fries, and 2 cokes. We really wanted to order oysters but they ran out, that's why we ordered the shrimp.   The taste of the spices was very good, and garlic butter was wonderful. We both loved the seasoning very much. But there was one problem for us, we realized that we don't like crawfish. We never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. We manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. On the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. We just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! And the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the Cajun fries we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.  The whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which I thought was a little high. We decided if we go back, we would order shrimp only and call to make sure they have oysters before we go again.",

When we got there, the place was packed and a crazy line out the door, so I thought it may have decent crawfish so I decided to wait 45 mins to get seated. Anyway, once we got in there, the menu confused me because there were a million different flavors of crawfish to choose from, which is unlike anything I've ever seen; the most flavor you usually choose from in the south is if you want them extra spicy or not. There were 3 of us, so we got a few pounds of crawfish to try out, of different flavors to start, we also got fried catfish, and an order of crab legs.     The crawfish were surprisingly pretty tasty! But the catfish didn't taste very good at all, and the crab legs were okay, but extremely overpriced and not for a good reason. Anyway, if I'm craving crawfish again in Vegas, and have time to wait for a seat, I'd go back but I'd only order the crawfish and nothing else.",

They serve it to you in a huge plastic bag and expect your hands to get dirty because there are no forks or spoons here!! The staff is very helpful and friendly!

If you love spicy food and seafood you should consider moving in next door because this will be a need in life you can't help but want more.   The service is great doesn't matter how busy it gets. The restaurant is the perfect size. And the food is just incredible. The price is amazing for the quality and quantity.   I am in love with all the flavours with that being said I can't pick my favourite. If you don't want things to get too messy because you don't like wearing gloves when eating you can definitely request to have the sauce on the side (you're playing it too safe. Stop that, it's boring).  By far one of my favourite spot for seafood and if you haven't been you really are missing out.   P.s.

But you can tell it's fresh & good lobsters   The crab legs are probably not in the season.. Not much comment..  Shrimp is a must order!! Good price, taste, quantity(? I guess since the shells doesn't weigh much).. The meat is fresh and got elasticity   Service wise, pretty good, we only waited less than 10min for a table even the place is packed..

We ordered the garlic and butter sauce but it was so much more than just garlic and butter!!!  I cannot do the many flavors going on in the sauce justice. I rarely go to the same place twice while on vacation but will absolutely be going back again before we leave!  Very casual, food brought out in plastic bags which you eat with your hands.",

The rice is kinda dry but them shrimp are super juicy! I've ordered the crawfish but just so much work for a little piece of meat! Lol. I've had their crab also but the best deal is the shrimp!  My son likes their rolls.  They also serve beer which is great with that spicy shrimp!",

I came around 1 or 2 pm and was greeted by a friendly, fresh faced girl who sat us right away. They didn't put our bibs on for us unlike a lot of places. (it gets kind of uncomfortable having a grown adult help you with your napkin ) they offered gloves to avoid the garlic smell stained to your hands for days!   We ordered a pound of King Crab and a pound of shrimp with medium hot n juicy sauce. I would say the medium sauce is definitely on the mild sauce so I would go higher if you like a nice kick. The crab was good but one leg seemed like it had been cooking a little too long. The shrimp were big and fresh.   All in all, this place did well and I will be returning",

I was so excited to try this spot out because I heard such great reviews about this place, but when when we ordered and got our food it was just okay. It was good, but not amazing. Besides the seafood freshness, the next important thing is the sauce and the sauce didn't really do it for me. When we got our food, the food runner gave us an extra half pound of shrimp instead of the half order of sausage. We flagged our server and she apologized and sent it back. Minutes later, the food runner gave us another bag of half pound shrimp.. Perhaps we didn't make ourselves clear enough before, but we sent it back again and told her that it was sausages not shrimp. It happened like again after and when we finally got the sausages, we weren't even hungry anymore.   For a small place with a lot of workers the service was a bit slow. Maybe it was just that one time we came in, but yeah maybe I'll come back.. But for the time being, my heart is where my favorite spot at home is.",

    "text": "My friends didn't realize that there were two locations which are fairly close together and so what had happened was that one group ended up being at one location while the other was at another, funny story lol. Anyways, so we are in Vegas and heard that this place was similar to The Boiling Crab & Crab Hut so we decided to check it out!  Service: was kind, our waitress was helpful and attentive. Atmosphere: pretty spacious, had a good amount of seating, and it seems to be bigger than the other location next to Mr.Tofu.  Food: my bf & I shared 1 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, in hot n juicy sauce, fried catfish basket w/cajun fries, and two corn. Verdict?  Pro: The hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. The two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. I also got to try my friend's corn fritters because I was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. I like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried.   Eh: the \"cajun fries\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't cajun fries but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. It was not the same... not what I imagined and had experienced at The Boiling Crab. Slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad.   Con: From the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when I bit into the crust of the fried catfish I was in awe. It doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. The catfish was okay not as fresh.   Overall, I didn't come here for the crawfish because I'm not really a big fan of that but I did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all. It was a good experience to try a new place but I think I have to stick to The Boiling Crab as still my favorite go to place for this type of meal.",

I had never tried crawfish before so I was not aware of the intense labor that is required to eat these little creatures. But it's ok because at the end you are rewarded with lots of flavor.  It was so messy I had to wear a bib, and the only way to eat them was using nothing but your fingers! I had to put aside everything my mother had taught me on table etiquette.   I have to admit that I had a wonderful time. This place is awesome. The food the service and the ambiance were exceptionally good. Everyone seems to be having a wonderful time! Can't wait to come back and try other things. Like the shrimp the crab legs or the oysters!   My question is.... Is it bad when you like something so much to the point of licking the juices of the fingers? Even if the fingers are those of your friends?",

The last time I went was in the middle of the afternoon at around 1:30. The service was really good. Granted, there were only 3 or 4 tables, but they were still really attentive. I arrived first and waited for my friend. They seated me immediately me and brought me water and my bib. I did have to wait for my friend for a bit as she ran on Filipino time. The servers kept checking on me to ask me if I was ready to order.    We both ordered a half pound of shrimp. It is very nice that with shrimp, we can order half a pound. My friend ordered the lemon pepper medium spicy. I ordered hot n juicy medium spicy as well. I love the taste of mine. Whenever I order shrimp, I always get lemons, limes, salt and pepper and dip my shrimp in it.   This is very very messy, so I would never order shrimp to go because it's a mess.   I think part of the reason is that I get so grossed out because the shrimp isn't peeled and deveinned, so you still that gross line that you can see while you eat. Next time, I might just devein all my shrimp after peeling it.  Something else that bothers me about the shrimp is that the flavor is all encased on the outside. The actual shrimp has no flavor. After I peel the shrimp, I still have to drench it in sauce.   The service is very superior here, though!",

I haven't been hot juicy crawfish for approximately a year and one thing that surprised me is the price of the seafood has gone up considerably in the last year. Honestly I would give this restaurant five stars if it wasn't for the exceptionally high price increases the last year. During the same time I purchase similar seafood at the supermarket and prices have just not gone up that fast. What used to be a very reasonably priced restaurant a few years ago I would consider on the high side now. As an example the peel and eat shrimp is now $14.99 lb!",

Ike's in SF was amazing. so of course I had to go try his places in vegas.   I've only ever had fried crawfish before in tn, so this was my first live crawfish place. Everybody said the spiciness was spicy, and as a non spicy eater, I took the mild (a little bit spicy). However, it wasn't spicy to me at all. so i think everything is a lil overhyped. The crawfish was Good! It was dfeinitely an experience. they give you these cute little bibs to put on, and the crawfish come out in a plastic bag for each customer. You order by the lb, and 1 lb/per customer is definitely enough. On the other hand, the CORN is great!!! omg i love the corn that comes in with the bag. its really great.   I only give it 4/5 stars bc the crawfish were good, but not AMAZING. I will have to say adam richman, this was a bit of a disappointment but I think I went in with super high expectations. (i also like everything fried, literally everything i eat i love it fried, so the fact that it wasn't fried i think deducted 0.5 stars)  But in the end, its a good place! i would definitely recommend. I've been to new orleans before and had authentic seafood there, and it had a very similar authentic taste.  (Also surprised at the cheapness of the bill)",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place...  So my friend Yannie has been raving about this place called Hot N Juicy.  \"Sooooo good,\" she says \"Better than boiling crab,\" she says \"You have to try it,\" she says  We were together in Vegas for New Years and decided it was time for me to try it after hearing so many good things about this place.  We ordered and the employees told us that the crawfish is frozen aka not fresh, so it's discounted, okay that's fair. So when we ordered 10lbs of shrimp for our group. Let me make a couple comparisons we can all relate to.  Plastic bottle liquor vs top shelf Soccer in America vs Football My shrimp vs fresh shrimp  My shrimp must have been the bottom of the barrel leftovers or something, but it was almost to the point of disgusting. Trying to peel the shrimp was difficult as the shrimp itself would just disintegrate and fall apart. It was like the employees packed a bunch of powder into shrimp shells and cooked it.   Highly highly disappointed in this place. The ONLY reason why I gave this an extra star is because the sauce was halfway decent.",

Located in a strip mall it is very casual, but nice and clean. I ordered two pounds of snow crab and a pound of king crab in their Hot N Juicy hot sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together and it was delicious. NOTE: you can order mild hot or extra hot, I am usually an extra hot kind of a guy(don't you agree? KIDDING!)) but the waitress warned me that there sauces  are very hot and customers always say the stuff is hotter that they expected. In fact it was True their medium is hotter than most places hot or even extra hot. it was not too hot for me but I was pleasantly suprised at the heat levels. We also ordered a few side dishes, frys and corn fritters. They also serve bottled beers which are a must in my opinion and I am not a big beer drinker but this food goes well with a beer or three LOL. Another note, it is kinda messy so don't wear white and wear the silly bib they give you.  I am looking forward to my next trip to vegas so I can go back and eat here again.",

The most egregious offense was the fact that they ran out of crawfish. Who wants to go to a seafood boil spot that is out of crawfish. Unfortunately I've got to deduct a star. Now to the food, I ordered the hot and juicy shrimp medium spicy, mussels hot and juicy style, Cajun fries, and fried calamari.  The Cajun fries were just fries with seasoning thrown on them. I didn't like them very much and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  2/5 stars  The fried calamari were small and forgettable. I will stick to the boil from now on. 1/5 stars.  The boil was great! The shrimp boil was a great blend of seasonings and none of the different components over powered the others. It wasn't too salty or garlicky like Boiling Crab. This place really does seafood right.  4/5 stars.  The conclusion: This is a wonderful little gem of a seafood place. I plan to come back for crawfish boil soon, so I plan to update my review.",

By the time we left, there were tons of people waiting.  Service was good, though not always available.  When we wanted to add a pound of shrimp, I had to send hubby up to the cash register to place the order.  Normally, when we go out with friends to other crawfish places, we get (insert house spice here)-Medium.  Because this was hubby's choice/birthday weekend, I let him order mild.  As it turns out, it was delicious!  The sauce was buttery, not greasy and very tasty without the flames on your tongue.  We did notice that the seafood was about $1+ more per pound than out here in California but that's understandable given that Las Vegas is kind of far away from the o-chin (Ralphie May fans will get that lol).  We enjoyed our meal and have promised to bring our friends back when we return to Las Vegas in about 3 weeks.  All aboard!!!",

I came with a friend and she and I had a pound of shrimp and crawfish both mild and original hot n juicy seasoning. It was soo good and a like spicy but that was pretty spicy for a mild. I definitely will be coming back to try the Dungeness crab and king crab legs.   The only reason I gave them a 3 star was bc our server wasn't the best. I'm used to having great service, which also makes the experience great and invites you to come back again. When taking our drink order she didn't even let my friend finish before taking off. When she came back to take our order, she seemed more interested looking somewhere else than paying attention. All in all she seemed rushed to take off and it wasn't even busy at all. Slow down and take your time lady.",

Alexis was inattentive, she barely checked in with our table our drinks were empty and our food took forever to come out. The table of four was seated after us and served before us, even the party of eight was seated after us and served before us. Half of our party of four received their food while we continued to wait for ours we order shrimp and snow crab. Once they were finished with there food we recieved our 10 mins later snow crab then the shrimp five minutes later(we didn't get gloves, and the other table next to us asked for leg crackers for is). When we inquired about our food she explained that everything comes out when ready. I understand that but wouldn't it make more sense to make orders together so that they can all be served at the same time! What's the point of going to eat out if you have to watch the other person eat while you wait? Alexis should've explained this. Melody  (wears a sunflower pendent) took over while Alexis was on lunch and was extremely nice and accommodating. Maybe more servers need to be on staff so the severs aren't overwhelmed and can provide excellent service. There are other restaurants in town comparable to this one, you should make sure you stick out more than the rest.",

The crab legs and live Louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. The price is surprisingly not that bad either. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a bowl of rice and paid 27 bucks. The crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. Hot N Juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. There are other sauces but Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as Boiling Crab. Parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space.",

Went today...craving crawfish...was told because crawfish out of season, they had only frozen or live brown crawfish.  I never had either so I asked the waiter to give me a suggestion.  She shrugged and said many customers take the frozen.    Decided 1 lb of frozen and 1 lb of brown....this was the worst food I have ever tasted!!!!!!!!   So I told waiter to take back the frozen (only ate 2 pieces) because it was nasty and give me a lb of shrimp instead.  Shrimp sucked too!  and worst of all, i got charged 6.99 for the two pieces of crawfish I ate, which I almost gagged on.  So, I gave zero tip!  For those of you trying to compare Boiling Crab to Hot N Juicy, my suggestion, wait for BC to open up here.  Should be soon.  I live in Las Vegas and am telling you to SAVE YOUR $$$$$",

    "text": "Thanks to some recommendation from native LV Yelpers, We decided to visit Hot & Juicy for dinner on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the Hot & Juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it.   Anything that made it onto Man Vs Food is likely the opposite of what I am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. As soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. Waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. I was intrigued.  The two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of Crawfish medium Hot & Juicy special, 1 lb of shrimp medium Hot & Juicy special and 3lbs Crab Spicy lemon pepper. We also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  It was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.  Everything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. The waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. You are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through.   Regarding the spice, I found medium wasn't enough and I regretted my decision. Also, I regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.  For the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in Toronto) it was fun. Anything that dirty is always a good time of course. The flavor of the lemon pepper was really outstanding. It was great.  The service was actually among the best we got in Vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  The crab was good, but I find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat.   Minus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. I would have been happy with bucket, no bags.",

When I arrived, there was no wait, my girlfriend and I were promptly seated. We ordered 2lbs of crawfish and a pound of shrimp, we added corn and potatoes to our mix (which are 50 cents a piece to add on). They have several different flavor profiles. We went with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning. It was heaven. It was spicy, savory, and garlicy.  In Louisiana when we have Crawdad boils, we throw down newspaper, here the tables were covered in plastic and they gave us bibs (which I need whenever I eat).   They will show you how to eat mudbugs if you have never had them, but I am a pro. They serve up large drinks in Styrofoam (which is so 1995), but they keep them filled.The seating isn't the most comfortable and the smell of place is in the air from like a mile away. After eating here, be sure to shower. You will smell like the fruit of the sea and garlic for like 2 days. It is totally worth it!  I don't know if their prices are fixed, but 1 lb of Crawfish was $9.99, not bad at all.",

    "text": "Went here for my first time last night. After hearing from so many friends, family, and coworkers how awesome this place was I decided to go and take some family from out of town. I am originally from the east coast so I am a bit spoiled on GREAT seafood. All the people telling me to go here are all from California or some other pacific coast state. Now I can understand why someone from the desert or west coast would like this place because they don't know any better but let me tell you, THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL. I could not believe how bland the seafood was especially with all the rave reviews of the sauces this place uses. The sauces are all extremely watered down and they do not penetrate to the actually food itself just the shells. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crawfish (which we were told were not fresh but frozen!!!), a dozen oysters(SO BAD), and calamari. We tried various sauces and spice levels and we just agreed that this place was a lot of hype for nothing. I have been to the Gulf many times and have had the type of food they are TRYING serve and the food here is just not even close. I did ask the manager where the seafood comes from and he told me ASIA mostly(FYI, seafood restaurants that get their shellfish from Asia are normally awful plus it's the cheapest possible shellfish on the market!!!). I guess I understand why the location is in China town and why most of the people at the restaurant were Asian. In addition to the food tasting awful, the service was very poor. Staffed with a lot of girls who seemed to be working their first serving job. We had to light signal flares just to get another beer. All the wait staff was talking about some party after work that they couldn't wait to get to and they kept grouping together to discuss rather than tend to the customers and lots of people were frustrated. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see how people who have never had decent seafood (mostly from buffets) would love this place as it's just like people who say the best sushi is at Ra Sushi because they just don't know any better. But if you have been to cities on the Gulf of Mexico and have had Gulf seafood or are from the east coast and have had great seafood then please pass this place up because all your friends telling you how awesome this place is have never truly had awesome seafood.",

When you walk in you start drooling right away, the aromas coming out of the kitchen permeate the whole restaurant and it is awesome!  Every time we go to LV now the kids want to go to HNJC and so do I!   You will get messy and you'll smell like HNJC for a while after you leave.    We always order the Hot n Juicy mild crawfish.  We all love spicy food but they aren't kidding when they say the mild is pretty hot.  My husband, 13 year old, and I can stand the medium but our 10 year old can't.  That's ok though because the mild has more than enough spice and we'd probably prefer it anyway.  Sometimes we get the shrimp, it is very tasty and just as messy as the crawfish.  I prefer the HotNJuicy medium for shrimp.  We had the king crab once, it was fabulous.  We've tried most of the flavors but now always go with the HotNJuicy Special.",

I hope everyone has been able to go HOT & JUICY to experience the food and I hope the service was better served with you than with my group of friends.   I've been in the hospitality industry for over 5 years now, and regardless if it's the F&B industry or the hotel industry, the service you give to your customers is KEY to the success of the business. But here's what I don't get...why \"ruin\" the food but make it extremely SPICY to a point no one can eat the food just because you just want them to get out of your restaurant? If that's the case, why not tell the customer that the kitchen is closing and you have already seated the last table instead of telling them they have 2 minutes to order! As memory should have serve you RIGHT, the group of people you just TRIED to push away have been loyal customers of HOT & JUICY since DAY 1; so of course it'll take less than 2 minutes to order!   I am definitely still raving about this because I still cannot believe how rude people can be. Sadly, I miss the food. But I shall stand my ground until Lainie B. and Mario can apologize publicly for treating customers the way they did. As an employee of an establishment, regardless of your level of management in the restraunt, you DO NOT SWEAR at your customers!   I hope no one else gets the service my friends experienced.",

    "text": "Stopped by on our way home from Vegas. The food was good, I actually like their sauce better than Boiling Crab (LA). However, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as I normally do. She basically said the Cajun fries are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. This was after I told her I like spicy foods. I def could of gone for the medium sauce, and I probably would of tries the Cajun fries if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. Not a great way to sell your product! Would of given then 4 Stars but they made one of my friend chicken wings instead of fried shrimp, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the chicken wings (their mistake). Would go back but they need to work on their service.",

Highly compared to Boiling Crab in southern California, Hot N Juicy doesn't delve much from the popular food-in-a-bag chain. I'm not too sure if the food comes out based on when the guests get there or when the food is done but often times, I've noticed it comes out really randomly. Sometimes, the other guests got their food before me when I ordered before them.  If you're looking for a mirror of Boiling Crab, Hot N Juicy is it.  I'd recommend something different to make this restaurant a gem in Las Vegas and not a copy of Boiling Crab.  People COULD start saying, \"Oh Boiling Crab? That's like Hot N Juicy in Vegas!\" Right? :)",

My friend ordered a pound of Garlic Butter shrimp, a pound of Garlic Butter crawfish, an I ordered my usual Hot & Juicy special shrimp, medium.  That would be the only thing I would warn you about is the spice level.  I like spicy food and even the medium makes me think twice sometimes.  The flavor is a perfect balance of heat, spices, garlic, butter and just awesomeness.  I hope to go one more time before I leave.",

When my wife and I go we usually get two pounds of crawfish and one pound of shrimp. We get one medium spiciness and two mild. (The medium's pretty hot and the mild is medium spiciness). We also get a basket of the soft shell crab which is delicious.   The shrimp and crawfish are messy as you have to peel your own and are laden in delicious sauce, so don't wear your Sunday best.",

    "text": "I either go to Hot N Juicy or have it delivered at least once a week. It's my all time favorite. I decided to take my mother their and enjoy dinner. The server took my order and I was specific about baby spice for The Drool(mother doesn't like spice) and a separate order of 1.5lbs of shrimp in Xtra Spicy(love the heat). Heidi the server let me know the 1.5lbs would be on separate bags (1lb and 0.5lb). I had no problem with that and I even repeated to her about 3 times for the Xtra spicy for the shrimp. She read it back and things were great. The shrimp comes first and it was baby spice. I reminded her that that wasn't correct. She said the kitchen made a mistake and took the shrimp back. Another server comes 2 minutes later with the shrimp she said it had been fixed but as I tasted one it had the same sauce as before and there was no spice in the bag. I brought it to my servers attention and she said she spoke to the manager and that they could only bring sauce on the side. No problem but the weird part was the server totally ignored my table after all that happened, didn't apologize for the mix up, and I was waiting a good 10 to 15 minutes for the Xtra Spicy sauce only for a different server to ask if I got the sauce ( which I hadn't). My original server Heidi serviced the table next to mine but never looked over or came to the table. I had to wave my hand in the air for water because she kept avoiding my table. Once the check came I noticed that it wasn't the kitchens fault. She put the order in wrong. So I asked for the manager only to find out there was never a manager on duty. I then spoke to the head server and the explanation she gave me wasn't an apology for mix up she had stated that when there are different orders they can't differentiate on the bag the different spice levels even though the table next to me had 4 different spice levels with 4 different flavors and there items weren't messed up. I let her know that I never got an apology and that was the hurtful part and all she said back was hey at least you got the sauce on the side. I was furious and sad. I left without a tip and feeling like the place I go to didn't care that it was their mistake and not mine. They kept making it seem like I was complaining that the spice wasn't 'hot enough'. I was sad because there was no spice and they kept making it seem like I ordered wrong.  It's highly upsetting and it makes me rethink about ordering or going in the restaurant again. It use to be my favorite up until this last visit last night 4/5/2018",

Memorial Day was a little difficult for the staff on Memorial Day because there was only two servers and the place was at max capacity 30 minutes after they opened. Regardless of how busy they were the food came out in a timely fashion and was amazing as always. I ordered snow crab and shrimp. The sauces might not be to your liking so I recommend trying them before ordering and ending up having a bad experience because you failed to try the sauce. The prices are fair but be ready to spend a little money. For the men out there, there are two bathrooms. I always see people standing by the first bathroom but if you walk by the first door the second door is also for males and it not the females...like most people assume. You'll want to wash your hands when you're done because you'll be a mess.",

A crowd of about 5-6 showed up shortly after and they apparently were really good friends with the hostess - she greeted them/was excited to see them/chatted with them/gave them all hugs and sat them right away (frustrating but we didn't say anything). We were seated about 10 minutes later. Never do I mind waiting but when you see open tables available or a crowd comes in after you and gets seated before you.. it's the little things.   It was some of our groups first time here (including myself) so we had questions and our waitress just didn't seem to care/annoyed to have to explain/answer questions I'm sure she gets her entire shift.

Arrived here after day club around 2-3pm and there was no wait for our party which was great since we were all hungry. I ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spicy with the Hot n Juicy sauce. I thought the shrimps were cooked perfectly, not too soggy. The sauce was also delicious! I ordered some sausages to share with my party and compared to other places it wasn't as flavorful. My party also ordered chicken wings and the cat fish basket. Wings were standard and we did not enjoy the cat fish basket. It was mainly because of the breading they used. The texture was too grainy for our liking. The cajun fries were just okay as well, I prefer thinner and crispier fries. If you are coming here just for the cajun shrimp then you would enjoy it much more than I did. Overall I would come back again if I was in the area and craving cajun food.",

I ended up ordering the boiled  shrimp and crawfish combo hot n juicy medium and that included corn. potatoes, sausages, 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of crawfish AKA the get your feet wet experience for $36. The flavor was amazing, however ALL of my crawfish were either old, over cooked, or frozen and they were supposed to be live, not ONE of them was the right so I ended up not eating them. I wasn't feeling too well plus it was my birthday so I didn't make a big fuss about it. The shrimp were good and fresh. I tore those up lol. I would come back but I would steer clear of the crawfish and before you ask the day I visited was April 29th 2019 right in the middle of crawfish season so if you advertise fresh then they should be fresh. The Server was friendly and even explained the reason the crawfish was so high lol.  Overall it was good.",

You can customize the heat and sauce offerings.    Ask for Tiffany - as a server, she's attentive and knows how to turn a table without rushing you.  To clarify my definition of attentive - the best servers are those who anticipate and observe.  They know when you need a refill or when a look of confusion crosses someone's face when they are looking at seafood tools like the cracker and splitter.  Tiffany is one of these.  Ask for her and complete a wonderful dining experience!",

The shrimp was delicious. The crab was a bit salty. The add-ons were tasty.   We arrived around 6:45 pm on a Friday and were quickly seated at a table. The wait would have been longer if we had requested a booth.  The service was just ok. We had to ask for a cup lid for my son's lemonade and when it didn't come after our waitress walked by our table twice my husband had to walk to the counter to get one. We also had to ask for cutlery and a bin to discard the shrimp and crab shells.  The meal all together is messy. You are given bibs and a roll of papertowel is already are the table. The food is delivered in clear plastic bags. There are no plates so you're eating off the table.   Every one enjoyed the experience and we will definitely be back.",

Upon walking in we were greeted and told it would be about a 20 min wait but we were able to order some beers to sip on while we waited so that was a major plus!   We ordered the lobster, snow crab legs, shrimp, && king crab legs! Oh ma gawd it was to die for. We got our spicy but it was a perfect spice not over bearing! The kids even loved them!   Service was decent; if I had any complaints itd be that they ran out of the shell crushing thing (not sure what its called but if u eat seafood its the metal thing u use to open to open up ur lobster) but other than that the food was awesome the price is about right.

With great reviews and how it was on Man vs. Food. It was a must try on my list when I went to Vegas. I got the hot and juicy special crawfish because the waiter said it's similar to BC's \"whole shabang.\" It is indeed 90% similar, and the 10% is that it was overload with garlic. Yup!! I was safe from vampires the whole weekend. Thank you hot n juicy, but no thanks. My garlic scent caused Jeremiah (the dude who sang birthday sex) to not show up at Chateau Paris Night Club that night. It was a sad day.  Ok, I exaggerate a little, but yeah I was a little overwhelmed with how much garlic is in it (and I love garlic). Nonetheless, the crawfish was succulent and fingers licking. The cajun fries were also so good, a tab better than BC's fries.   The staff was friendly so that is a plus.   Crawfish was $8.99/lb...expensive! But I guess the price came with fame.  I'd recommend this place if you like BC or/and garlic of course.",

Salty, garlic-y, spicy. I know that this place is known for their crawfish, but I usually get two pounds of shrimp when I get here. Mostly because I feel like shrimp has more meat on it. Two pounds usually fills up about two people.  I get it to-go because I feel like I can eat a lot cleaner at home. That's just a personal preference though. Also, I have a McDonalds right next to my house, so I usually pick up large fries from there too. Dipping the fries in the sauce is bomb.  If you're a seafood lover like me, then next time you're in Vegas, you need to drop by here. You'll be thanking me when you walk through those doors.",

The place was nice, clean and good looking waitresses. Our waitress was very nice and attentive to us.     The place was 2/3 empty on a Wednesday afternoon during CES 2015..   - Snow Crab Legs - Hot N Juicy Special. medium spicy. The bag came out looking good, until I tasted to sauce, it was so salty that I almost spitted out.   - Crawfish  - Hot N Juicy Special. medium spicy. The waitress told me it was fresh, it wasn't. It was frozen, and uneven in size. A few of them was smelly and mushy. The sauce was unbearable salty.     I looked around and I wonder was it just my best friend and I, our taste buds could be that way off. How can anyone eat food this salty. We left with our mouths swollen. I didn't touch the crawfish.... We told the waitress, she said no one was complained and they have been popular in Vegas for years. Although she didn't offer us the credit for the food we didn't eat either.     My best friend and I used to own Coco's Crawfish in San Francisco a few years back 2008-2011. We know the business well. This was before the crawfish got all trendy in San Jose and the OC.     I don't know how it can be this off. I would never come back here again. It got me sick later in the day. It ruins my palate for the rest of the day. Sad!      P.S. They also sell their waitress calendar, it's almost like Hooters, except they didn't show much skin.",

    "text": "I've been here serval times before not because I'm a huge crawfish fan but it's because everyone I know is. Every time before have been just good but this time I really did enjoyed everything.  This is the original Hot n Juicy of Las Vegas and has always been legit except for the parking. Parking kinda sucks but that doesn't stop us or anyone else from coming. The atmosphere is great and service has gotten even better through out the years. That is all because they are staffed with fun young servers to hype the joint up which makes it a exciting experience.   The music is hip, there are TVs all around and they have plenty of seating for the amount of space they have. To keep the place cool from the hot Vegas weather they have tons of ceiling fans which really keeps the Resturant comfortable. The day we went was pretty chilly outside so inside it was actually pretty cold, good for the summer days but not that day.   If you are not a big crawfish person like myself not to worry they have other items on the menu like Chicken wings, shrimp, clam, calamari, catfish and nuggets with fries basket. There is also etouffee which is like Jambalaya and it was really really good. The oysters we ordered was so good, fresh and juicy. The potatoes and corn that soak in the Cajun juice is always amazing and my favorite part of the bag. With the right amount of spice and the right amount of Cajun the shrimps was delicious. The craw fish wasn't bad as well I just don't care for them. The fried calamari was battered and seasoned just right and paired with their season fries it really hits the spot.   Don't forget it's always fun to eat at a place where you are required to wear a big plastic bib and gloves to fully enjoy your food. Or maybe get a Polaroid taken to be put up on the walls to remember a bday celebration or just to say you've eaten at a place that was featured on Man vs Food. But no matter what don't forget to try this place it's worth it.",

Im pretty sure if you stay at bally's and when you check out. The front desk says. hey if you pay with cash i will give u a discount? no way. this is called tax fraud.  Rule# 1 about eating seafood in the nevada. ONLY in a hotel! there stuff is so rubbery and nasty. i really could not eat it. and i eat pretty much everything. but this was the 1 that was impossible.   I dont think any real foody would disagree.  my score: 1-10  staff- 3 menu- 2 price- 2 bathrooms- cant even be rated is was that bad \"0\"  over all- Total Scam!",

    "text": "I love Sundays, besides being \"holy\". (I am a good girl). As usual, I have my Sunday treat but it was \"messy\" and \"kind-of-getting dirty\". I just had to have...aaah, crawfish.  I would say that is the closest I could get myself to transporting my state of mind in my good ole' neighborhood in the South. Since lived there, and having crawfish and alligator meat as Southern fare, crawfish became my last Sunday's dinner.   The smell of garlic, pepper and spice filled my nostrils upon entering. Windows brought in the early evening light as we walked in this cozy restaurant with its simple dining set-up. Rows of wooden chairs and white plastic-covered tables. Each table had a roll of paper towel. Television perched high up on one wall. Not much talking around, diners were busy....   Met by a smiling male waitstaff, and got a seat and table by the wall. Menu was simple in a rectangular paper. I knew what I liked. What else? but crawfish! I yearn for the days I would buy them from a seafood grocer in North Carolina and take it home to steam & boil it in my gigantic steamer-boiler pot. I am great at cooking crawfish. My kitchen has a rollaway spice rack filled with spices, stainless steel cookwares and stainless steel range-oven...I like making seafood and crawfish for myself and whenever I have guests.   But this time, this restaurant cooks it for me. Order the crawfish or  seafood by the pound..or two...or three...as much you like. Also indicate the type of spice and amount of spiciness. The waitstaff pleasant and helpful about anything unclear about the spiciness. If you care to ask about how to peel off the crawfish meat from the shell, the waitstaff will show you how. But I do know how, so let me say that I am hands-up, thumbs-up delighted when the crawfish I ordered came in a plastic bag inside a bucket. It was pulled out of the bucket and presented to me and my Mom. It was steaming Hot-and-Juicy! just like the restaurant is called. The aroma was invigoratingly intoxicating! But stop! one thing I just have to do. \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" so where else would I go before all this? The bathroom awaits for a good hands cleansing. Did that so fast! Yes, hands where the main activity going in this restaurant. Everyone was just eating away with hands! Diners were busy! By golly, this is a feastful of fun! The crawfish was extrasuperfantastically delicious! Well made, not too dry! There was sauce inside the plastic bag. Spicy, it was especially my request of Louisiana Hot and Spicy Special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the South! Small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. Besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. With sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. Also, the crab legs (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. A side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of Creole seasoning. Oh, corn-soft-ness!  Alas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! My Mom and I was delightfully full and messy. Yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the Creole-Cajun-Louisiana sauce but no cares. The table covers gets trashed by the waitstaff after each table is vacated. There's water in the bathroom, just go wash those hands! But will surely go back for more hot and juicy sea eats!",

    "text": "Hot n Juicy is crap!!!  I can't imagine why it has four stars and why people are comparing it's goodness to boiling crab!  This place doesn't even come close to BC, and I'm not just referring to the food.  First of all, there's nothing hot n juicy about the food they serve!  The sauce is so boring!!! it lacks so much flavor and is freaking watery.  It seems like the shrimp was cooked, steamed, then tossed in the bag along with the sauce.  If this is how they do it, they're missing out on some major flavor absorption within the shrimp!  Not to compare it to boiling crab, but you can tell BC lets their shrimp stew in the sauce because every piece is saturated with it's yumminess.  Anyway, that's all I've bothered trying here.  To make things worse their prices are a tad bit more expensive and definitely not worth paying for watered down shrimp in a bag.  Moreover, they do not use fine ground pepper!  Ugh, who wants to have big ass chunks of ground pepper on their shrimp??!! How hard is it to invest in FINE ground pepper??  Yes, it's that important and yes, it makes a difference in taste.  All food aside, the decor of this place sucks too!  They have these tacky posters of all this French stuff.. Why???!? of all places would you have these hanging at a restaurant that is totally irrelevant to the type of food being served?!  Also, I think the pictures of people on one side of the wall looks weird.  Whatever, I gave this place a try every time I  had my sporadic craving of BC (twice).  Will I try again?? I'll probably just wait til I'm back in the bay to satisfy my hunger because hot n juicy ain't hot or juicy enough for me.  Btw. Service is just alright.  Nothing major and nothing to make note of.  Oh, and if you pay with cash I believe you get 10% off your check.",

It was mouthwatering good!!  If you are freaked out with shrimp and crawfish all still dressed, go for it!  It was the best seafood I've had in a long time.   There was a ton of garlic in the sauce.  So good!!  Paper towels are provided for your messy hands.    There was a couple who was from Louisiana who actually sought out this restaurant and they also loved the food!    Get there quick!  BTW, don't forget to wear your bib so you don't get that sauce all over your clean clothes!",

Went there during lunch time and the restaurant was almost full. Luckily there's no wait throu !! Since this was the first time My bf and I went there; the server explained to us how to order and stuff like that.  We ordered 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish and a dungeness(forgot how to spell lol) crab. The two sauces that we ordered are garlic (medium) and hot n juicy special (medium). There are 4 kinds of spicy level from mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. We had the medium and even my bf and I really like spicy food; medium is quite spicy. Would like to try \"spicy\" but never \"extra spicy\". People who can't eat spicy should just order mild.  We dunno if the seafood was fresh or frozen but it's ok since the sauce is REALLY GOOD !!!! Addicted to the Hot n Juicy special !!!! so good so good so good !!!!!  For people who never had crawfish before, crawfish is like a small version of the lobster and the meat is more soft than lobster. I think the meat is soft and good but i hate taking off the \"skin\".  My bf and I kinda regret ordering the \"dungeness\" crab because it was so expensive !!!! And we had a hard time eating the crab's meat and this crab costed us like $40 bucks !!!! We will not order this one next time; instead we will order more shrimp !!  heard that the corn and potatoes are good too!!! Will definitely come back!!  And for ladies please dun wear your fancy clothes or dress !!!",

    "text": "Hot N Juicy is one of those places that I never thought I would like.  Growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with crab legs and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  As I got older I saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  I just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!  And then there was Hot N Juicy.  Admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  If I didn't care much for crab, why would I care for crawfish?  The answer is easy: the Hot N Juicy Special sauce.  Medium spice.  I went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for Hot N Juicy.  That sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  The garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  You'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  But all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.  My current favorite is the shrimp.  Crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  Not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time I went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  But with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  But it's okay, I have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  Next time I go I'll have to try the crab.  So has my mind changed about seafood?  No not really.  As it stands, I'm really in it for the sauce.  No Hot N Juicy special, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  Five stars for instilling a craving that I never thought I would have, and having consistently delicious sauce.",

We almost ordered medium, but for the first time mild was the way to go and we love spicy food.  We ordered two lbs of crawfish and one lb. of shrimp. Overall I would just get the shrimp for $10 a lb. the crawfish was a bit of a disappointment mainly because most of them were super tiny and it was not worth all that work to get a tiny bit from the tail.  The hostess did recommend that next time to try the lemon pepper dungeonus crab.",

I came out on a WED night and it wasn't packed. I wonder how it is on the weekends. The Staff is nice and the place is great for a group of friends. I recommend sharing food as most items on the list is served in pounds. *WATCH OUT* the sauce is *HOT* I love spicy food so I order the MEDUIM and even that was a little to HOT for me!!! The sauce is one of the best and most flavorful I've had. If you've gone to other places, you gotta try this place out!!!

    "text": "This place is amazing!  Came here on Saturday before they opened so we could nab a parking space and were one of the first customers there.  It was our first time there so we got 2 lbs crawfish, a pound king crab legs, a pound of Dungeness crab and some Cajun fries.  We got the hot n juicy seasoning in medium and it was perfect!  Perhaps a bit salty for my taste but the flavors were explosive in a good way.  My tongue was dancing.  They use lots of garlic so you will smell like garlic afterwards.  Tip, if you use your bare hands, ask for some lemon wedges to wipe your fingers down to help tame the seafood and garlic smells before doing a final wash with soap and water.  Because soap and water alone isn't enough to combat the garlic!  I can eat spicy and the medium was spicy but not anything you can't handle.  My party doesn't eat too spicy so that's why we opted for the medium level.  But anywho, the crawfish that day was frozen but still they were so delicious!  The Dungeness crab was super juicy and soft.  Everything tasted so amazing that we put in another order of crawfish and crabs!  And we devoured about 11 lbs of shellfish altogether.  On top of that, we had fries and some baskets to wash it all down :).   Wish there was a hot n juicy where I live.  Come here to satisfy your Cajun shellfish hunger and come early for parking, totally worth camping out for this joint in the hot desert heat!",

The crawfish were really good, not soggy and mildly spiced for my tastes choosing the hot n juicy spice.  They were out of stone & blue crab, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  I got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.  pros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold. cons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, WTF?",

I am going to start off by saying all of their food choices are amazing, however, their shrimp is the best. I always get a pound of the Hot and Juicy special and not once have I been disappointed. Their sauces are fantastic, the garlic gives it a nice kick. The fact that you can actually interact with your food makes it an even better experience. The prices are great for the quality of food you get, so no complaints there. I must also say that their service is spectacular. All of their servers are very upbeat and always checked on their customers. I go there so much that they now recognize me. They are so much fun, I can safely say that this is one of the better places off-the-strip in terms of service. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a high-quality cajun seafood place, just make sure to bring gum for that garlicky smell.",

This place is a ok size establishment, the service could be a bit quicker. I had 2lbs of crawfish with their Hot N Juicy special spicy seasoning which was off the hook, so flavorful!! Came with corn, potatoes and a side of sausage all packed up into one bag to mix in with all the other flavors (genius). I have to say though, especially since I had the spicy seasoning, my hands and somehow my car smelled like seafood for a couple days LOL but I didn't mind! Hot N Juicy does stick to their name and it's nice to have such seafood spot out here in the desert!",

The Decor is very simple and nothing to write home about and the sides were not quite as generous as in big D. I mean it came with few potatoes and corn and we had to order extra even though we ordered a few pounds of Crawfish, crabs, peeled shrimp and crab cakes.  The highlight of my day was when i had to put on the bib around my neck while i went to work with the Crawfish. we were given a roundtable and all the food was placed in the middle with a nylon table covering which made the clean up process a lot easier.  They had different grades of seasoning and spices for the Crawfish so you can specify how hot you want it.  I will definitely love to go back next time i am in Sin City and still up from gambling which never happens",

For the full review and pics go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kats9lives.com%2F2008%2F07%2Fhot-n-juicy-in-vegas.html&s=3e21adfa3d7d268da2955430fe6d471ef32196ad18d842891dffec49474bcc0e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kats9lives.com/2008/07/h...</a>  I don't know if this place or Boiling Crab came first, but I think Boiling Crab probably because they have a bunch of stores.  Either way they are both pretty good and a good value. ^_^   We ordered Shrimp, Crawfish, Fried Catfish, Wings, and more.  The sauce was good for the shrimp and crawfish.  It's light on the celery, which I like.  We got a bowl of rice to eat the rice with and that was really good.  It was too bad that they ran out of the gumbo.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  I think we decided that the shrimp is a better deal because you barely get any meat in the crawfish, but those crawfish are good! Just too much work! =P lol The prices at Boiling Crab are cheaper but Hot n Juicy Crawfish was a great find.  My family really enjoyed it and the bill was very reasonable.  If you like Cajun food and you are in Vegas then definitely stop by! ^_-",

We had two pounds of crawfish, and it was exactly as I had hoped: juicy, spicy, savory with just the right amount of acid to cut through the generous amount of butter and not leave you feeling too disgusted.  We also tried the cajun fries, which were delicious and a half order of the andoulle sausage, both of which were delicious.  The main attraction, of course, is the crawfish.  It's fun.  It's messy and I like how the restaurant doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  This place is definitely a gem and I would recommend that everyone go at least once to try it out.",

    "text": "I love this place! A few people have mentioned they saw this place on Man vs Food, that's what happened to us too. Saw it, then decided to check it out while we were in town. A no-frill place outside & inside, plastic sheets on the table with a roll of paper towel. They serve mainly seafood (shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, fried fish, etc). Your seafood comes with your choice of seasoning, which also comes with your choice of spiciness levels. I picked the Hot & Juicy Special seasoning in mild, which it still had a bit of a bite to it, with a robust garlic flavor. I loved it.  Your seafood is delivered to your table in a plastic bag, and if you order any potato or corn on the side, they come in the same bag too, along with the seafood & seasonings. My husband ordered the fried catfish basket and he said they were good. No utensils, just you, your plastic bibs and your hands. So it does get quite messy. I ordered  pound each of crawfish, shrimp & crab legs. Just get down to cracking with my food & a few bottles of beer made for a nice, relaxed lunch while on vacation.   The staff were nice & friendly. Since we were first-timers the girl who seated us explained the different seasonings & spice levels. She was very responsive, replenishing our drinks & clearing up items as we finish.   Not cheap, but seafood usually isn't. I thought the market prices were fair. This will definitely become my Vegas spot to re-visit next time I come in town.",

    "text": "Went to HnJ near Decataur for lunch on May29, 2014.  Coming from Hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in LV that we like to try.  We last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to HnJ (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central C-Town). I guess you can say that my wife and I are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  We lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  So in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'Hot n Juicy' sauce, medium hot.  Add to that two potatoes and two corn and one bowl of rice.  Talk about plenty of food for two people!?  Our server was Joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  Joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever. Wife ordered a coke and I ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  In good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  This was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, I don't think that I can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  I would definitely order that again.  My wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  As you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  Also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  Definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. For us on this visit the food was definitely five stars. But I must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  There was another female server and one male server - and I can't help but observe people when I'm out dining.  They both were like our server Joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your HnJ meal a great experience - great food and great service.  We've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day HnJ was tops.",

    "text": "This place is a direct copy of The Boiling Crab restaurants in So Cal.  Everything on the menu is almost exactly the same even the different spices.  The one unique thing that we noticed was that this place had a fried soft shell crab platter, which you only get like 1 crab or just barely more.  The shrimp didn't seem as fresh as what you'd get at Boiling Crab as most of the heads were falling off the shrimp in our bags.  The fried fish platter also was on the smaller side, 3 pieces of fish.  The cajun fries were not what you'd expect, it looked like they sprinkled on the spices as they were in the basket so the spices are not really distributed evenly on each fry. The service was a step down from Boiling Crab, it's slower, they aren't really on the ball for drink refills.  Overall the food was still pretty good, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would, but for me 4 stars is a place I'd recommend unconditionally.  I'm not sure if I would recommend Hot N Juicy Crawfish, because I know how much better it could be.",

    "text": "Being from Louisiana, my crawfish expectations are high.  The reason why I give this review a 2.5 (rounded off) is simply because of their hot/spicy sauce that they sauteed the crawfish in. If not for the sauce, I would have given this a 1. The crawfish itself was over cooked to the point where it broke apart when you try to peel it, similar to eating dead crawfish. The tails of the crawfish was bland due to the fact that they boil the crawfish with little seasonings to none at all, then they sauteed it with their signature sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and I think that's what made it for me. The amount of crawfish oil they added was insane though! It was spicy, but the spiciness was due to the oil, not from the seasonings. Nonetheless, it was very unique and memorable.",

The prices weren't at all bad and they are pretty quick service-wise. Their sauce is spicy even for the mild, but still finger licking good! I would rather choose Boiling crab's sauce over Hot N Juicy's, but overall Hot N juicy's got my vote. Faster seating, quick service, good prices, and FREE water?? Yeah of course i'd pick Hot N Juicy!   My only complaint about this place is that they kind of over cook the shrimp so it makes it a little harder to peel off the shell.",

The crayfish, at an appalling $11 per pound, are an absolute joke - pathetically tiny and completely overwhelmed by their signature \"Hot And Juicy\" sauce so much so that you can not even taste the minuscule portion you manage to pry from its tail. Don't even bother sucking out the head, you might as well just poke a hole in the bag they serve them to you in and drink away.   There are many things this place does that are very cool, and obviously people are coming in the doors, but one gets the impression that no one in management cares if you like their food or not.",

We ordered several pounds of crawfish (hot & juicy, mild), shrimp (hot & juicy, mild), chicken wings, and snow crab.  We also had sides of rice and creole fries.  Even though we ordered mild, these crawfish really pack some heat and a lot of garlicky goodness. The corn that comes in the bag is so saturated with the yummy sauce, and I wish there were more corn cobs in the bag.  I also wish I had some bread to sop up all the sauce. I actually enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab more than I did the crawfish, probably because there's more meat and the shell is easier to peel. This is a place where you get down and dirty, bibs and all (gloves optional).  Really fun and worth checking out.",

The servers were very friendly and helpful. The place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. I had Blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets. I ordered the Fried Shrimp basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of sweet potato fries for $4.50. Blanche ordered the Fried Catfish basket that comes with fries for $9 and change. The fried shrimp was delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. However, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp I thought it was very overpriced. The sweet potato fries I could eat every day. So good. A bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well. Beer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. Not bad. Was a little disappointed to have them run out of Bud Light after the first one I ordered. I usually don't like switching beers once I start drinking one but I made an exception to try a Blue Moon. Overall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. Or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times. On a last note.. I do wish they would work on the temperature in their. I think it was cooler outside.",

Especially since we were noobs at this, we got crawfish on our faces and on each other in the beginning.  Excellent place to eat!  I will definitely come back for some next time in Vegas.  Thanks yelpers!  =)",

    "text": "My husband and I love this place!!!!  We got the crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes in the Hot and Juicy seasoning/ medium heat.  YUM!  We did smell like garlic for the next couple days, but it was totally worth it.  As some one else said, the corn did seem a little over cooked, but it wasn't bad enough to stop me from going and getting it again. I know people say there are better places in CA, but I don't happen to live in CA, so will probably not get a chance to try other places anytime soon. I love being able to support a local restaurant that is privately owned- well done Hot N Juicy Crawfish!",

I haven't had crawfish in like 20 years when I lived in Mississippi and I totally forgot how to even crack one open. So as soon as I got there I was ready to order some yummy crawfish. I chose the 2lb bag seasoned in garlic sauce with mild spiciness. Oh it was so good. My hands got so messy, but it was all worth it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, very open and spacious. It was not busy at all and the servers were polite and friendly as well. I would definitely go back to satisfy my crawfish cravings:)",

When my boyfriend and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out Hot N Juicy Crawfish. I know there's one in Fountain Valley but we wanted to check out the O.G. Hot N Juicy restaurant. Wasn't this place featured on one of the food network shows or something? Anyway, the servers were nice and informative. The reason why I say informative is because one of the servers thoroughly explained to us the concept of eating crawfish. When she was explaining, I was laughing in my head because shoot, I am a pro/master at eating this stuff! Not to brag but I worked at a crawfish restaurant before so yeaaa I think I am pretty familiar with this stuff haha! Nonetheless, it was still fun listening to her show us how to eat crawfish. Anyway, on to judging the food itself... The seasoning was very good! I thought it would be whatevers and nothing can compare to Boiling Crab's seasoning but the seasoning here comes close to Boiling Crab. If I'm ever in Vegas, I will stop by Hot N Juicy again. I wonder if the seasoning at the Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Fountain Valley taste similar to the one in Vegas...",

[i forget the rest] and then choose what heat level you want your spice at.  we're rookies so we ordered what my friend michelle e ordered which was  a lb of shrimp and a lb of crawfish.. [we took head of the spice warning] and had mild spiced crawfish and medium spiced shrimp with a side of medium sauce.  the waitress was super friendly and very helpful.  when i asked her i was cracking the crawfish wrong.. or missing something   we put our bibs on and got to it!   sides:  rice and cajun fries.    the crawfish:  um, i was a little confused.  i realized late in the game that whatever i was looking for beneath the shell wasn't there, and that it was what it was.. which was nothing much.  so if your looking to find lots of meat?  it's not hiding under a crawfish shell.. BUT!  the juice was excellent!  the shrimp was VERY good.. succulent and full of juices.  surprisingly, either sauces were too hot for me... just REALLY garlic-y!    we were prepared to order more... but this was perfect for the both of us.  the garlic... lasts ALLLL day.  gum.. bring lots of gum.   mouthwash even.  and drink something to keep the burps down.",

Maybe some employees called in sick. They should operate like ChickFilA we need a table for 11 and showed up at 5pm; we got a table at 545pm the pear margarita had pear/salt goop around the edge of the glass and was full of ice this place is super tiny and cramped for the customers that frequent it  the food was good and was bought out as it was ready.

After watching that one episode of Ugly Delicious on Vietnamese Cajun, I found myself more receptive to trying this type of cuisine. Man, have I been missing out!  First off, this type of food definitely fits the bill of ugly delicious. You will get messy despite the bibs, gloves, or plastic-covered tables. You pay for market price for the shellfish per pound (it can get pricey!), but you can add in corn, sausage or potatoes in the flavor-soaked marinades as well. We opted for a pound of shrimp and a pound of green mussels. We also got to try the snow crab legs. There are many different types of seasonings, but we stuck with their specialty Hot N Juicy marinade. For spice level, if you can't handle spicy food at all, stick to mild. Medium was a bit too much for me to enjoy.   I was surprised by how large and jumbo the shrimp sizes were. That also goes for the crab and mussels. The corn was a delicious teaser addition to our bag. A side of rice is also nice to temper the intense flavors. They also have excellent cajun fries!  Pro-tip: Everyone here gets Sprite to wash all that seasoned food down. Trust!",

It would have been nice to come with more people to share food, but I opted for the king crab legs, which were monstrous. The meat was excellent. I also ordered a side of rice and enjoyed the seafood juice/sauce with the rice and sausages.   I was able to try a sampler of the crawfish, and would have ordered more if I were not dining alone. I would probably order the live crawfish, though they were out that day and only had frozen.  Service was very friendly and attentive when I went, and the interior was as nautical as expected. Prices not cheap, but most of the seafood was sold by the pound and I think comparable to similar-type restaurants.",

We noticed that most people had their food before is that came after we did.  This is a lot work.  My fried shrimp had WAY too much batter on them, I asked for 10, got 5 and waitress we nice and took off bill.  Shrimp did not look like the picture.  Disappointed.",

    "text": "I love the food here and the service. We never wait a long time to get our food once we are seated. Ofc we always have to wait an hour to actually be seated lol but it is our fault for going on the busiest times. Which is after 6pm on weekends. Anyways that is not the businesses fault, that's good, long wait times means good food and good service. The only thing  that threw me off about my last trip here was the fact that their was sooo many people crowded around in the back waiting area by where our table was. So that meant that they were standing so close to our table watching us eat! The most uncomfortable thing for me ever. I've never experienced this. There was like 15 people standing and sitting in the waiting area where the chairs are, just watching us eat pretty much. Super uncomfortable. They should  not let so many people stand back there, that's a safety hazard first off, they are blocking off a walkway area for employees and guests. second of all its super annoying and weird when strangers are just watching you eat and hearing your conversation. After like 7 people are there taking up all the chairs, they just should just ask them to wait outside no fcking standing around. How awkward for those people waiting in chairs, lets just say they have to get up or go somewhere and you're just standing in front of them i mean literally your butt is near their face that is how close and how many people were in that area. Big ass families just standing around waiting. BRO go tf outside what are you thinking?  Let people enjoy their meals in peace, I don't want you drooling and echandole ojo to my food! So weird making eye contact with someone as you're sucking the meat off a crab leg... LOL Yeah I'm never  coming here when its that busy again, that was a weird experience. Some people have no manners, like you guys are crowded in the back staring at people eat there food, why don't you go outside and just wait? There is clearly not enough room for you there. I'd never do that....",

I visited Vegas with my girlfriends one weekend and was adamant about coming to this restaurant. We started our lunch off with a basket of garlic cajun fries to share. The fries tasted mediocre and I don't recall tasting any \"cajun\" flavoring. I also ordered a pound of garlic shrimp at mild with added corn and sausage. The bag came out piping hot when our server brought it out to us.  The sauce was mediocre; nothing spectacular that made me wanting to come back for more. My corn tasted 2 days old which of course I told our server! She was at least nice enough to remove it off our bill. :)   After having such high expectations for this place, I realized this restaurant is totally overrated! I still prefer my Boiling Crab over this place any day!!",

In the first place, the name of the restaurant is Hot N Juicy Crawfish and they didn't have any Crawfish. This is not a good sign...we then ordered oysters, typically they have blue points, this day they had Canadian oysters, they were unbelievably small, tasteless, very expensive and a big mistake to get. We shared our displeasure, they didn't care. We also ordered the soft shell crab, a bit pricey for what you get, but pretty good. The three of us got the shrimp and it was very good. The service was very good. For what we paid, I can't see us going back.... it's just not that good.",

I will make sure I let everyone  I know about this place and make sure they no longer eat in any of the Hot N Juicy places. I can say I have never been treated  this way by anyone ever.

Anyway, this time around was definitely A LOT better. Our server was Max and he was always on it. Right when we entered, we were seated immediately and got our orders taken, which then came out in reasonable time. Considering how full they were, I was obviously impressed by the time I got my hands into my 1 lb shrimp. The order was made correctly and very delicious. I've never had fried catfish melt in my mouth that way before, it was amazing! The shrimp though, could have been a little better, the skin was really sticking on the meat. But for flavor, it was worth the peeling.   Max was always checking up on us regularly and refilling our water without us having to ask. Kuddos! And to be honest, this visit made me forget about my first visit. So Definitely check them out.   Twas a great dinner.",

    "text": "So this is a duel review between Hot N Juicy and Smokin' Crawfish.  As you can tell by this review, I'm all in with Team Smokin'.  But isn't it True with life?  Do you want a Hot guy/gal, or do you want a Smokin' guy/gal?!   Told you so!  Time of Visit: Hot - Thursday night around 9pm Smokin' - Friday night around 9pm  Wait time: Hot - For eat in, there were 7 parties ahead of us so we decided to do take away. Smokin' - Lots of room; seated at a booth promptly.  Parking: Hot - small parking lot so we had to park in the dark residential alley akin to Freddie Krueger's neighborhood.  It was a bit scary and we ran for the car. Smokin'- plenty of room in the shopping center.  No sweating or running required.  Service: Hot - Given the wait time, decided to order to go at the to-go counter.  There were 3 staffers there, but no one acknowledged us for a solid 5 minutes.  We didn't even get a \"be with you a minute.\"  Ignored and they didn't care! Smokin' - cast and crew were very attentive... actually beyond attentive.  The tag team waiter and waitress were great, funny, and helpful.  Billy, I can tell you love your job since you are just fab at it.  Price for crawfish: Hot - $11.99/lb Smokin' - $11.99/lb  Quality of crawfish: Hot - tasted frozen and lots of cracked heads.  It's never a good thing to have a crack head.  Most of the crawfish were very small.  Size does matter when it comes to the crawfish. Smokin' - obviously live crawfish, lots of different sizes and heads were all in tact.  Meat had a nice chew.  The Gear Hot - bib and gloves (to go), you provide your own table cloth (I used the hotel laundry bags!) Smokin' - high end paper table cloth, bib and gloves  Poop sack: Hot - Not sure what these crawfish were swimming in, but the pooped sacks were very full of who knows what. Smokin' - Poop sacks not as heinous as Hot and actually most were pretty white as oppose to black.  Seasoning: Hot - Ordered the Hot N Juicy Special in mild.  It had great depth of flavors with different levels of seasoning.  Hot actually wins in this category. Smokin' - Ordered Smokin' Style in mild.  Flavors were good and garlicky, but just a notch below the layers at Hot.  However, my companion thinks Smokin' wins in this category also....  Sigh, I guess I'll have to come back again and again to taste test.  2nd Date Quality (the come-back factor): Hot - Not even if you treat me like a call girl and paid me. Smokin' - Anytime baby!  Atmosphere: Hot - Hurry up and eat so we can get someone else's a$$ in your chair. Smokin'- Take your time and talk to me.  Also, try to win a lobster from the claw machine while you are at it and Smokin' will even cook it for you.",

We ordered the dungenous crab (spicy, hot n juicy), 2 pounds of crawfish (spicy, hot n juicy), order of fries and an order of rice. (gotta have some rice) :) We love spicy food and their 'spicy\" was pretty dang legit. Oh and btw, they have Stella....ON TAP!  Parking can be tricky. Come early. We came around 5pm on a Friday night and had no issues finding parking or a table.  This place is definitely outside of the strip, they have a location on the strip, but this location is worth driving to or getting an Uber to. No bad meals given here!",

    "text": "I was in town to visit family and had a family member who recommended dining in at hot n juicy. I'm from SD and so Boiling Crab is more of a thing for us back home. Heads up, I am a fan of Boiling Crab. But I must say I think things have changed. I went in on a busy night and there was a wait. My family and I were hangry! But it was worth the wait. We were greeted right away by a young man name Peet/Peter (i forgot). He took all of our orders very well and our drinks came out fast due to another server name La who accompanied him. Our orders came out quickly; which was surprising because it was a busy night. We were ready to feast! Thankfully we had everything ready to start eating. Gloves, bibs and utensils! Plus the food. My family ordered different flavors. We had Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper and Hnj. All three flavors were way better than Boiling Crab. Especially the HnJ. My father asked one of our server (La) what was the ingredients for the sauce but she told us it's a secret. Haha. She said if she told us we would never come back. Which is True! It was a seasoning that was FULL OF FLAVOR. Sweet! Spicy! Citrusy! All combined. The shrimps were pretty big! It was well seasoned. Our king crabs were easy to eat and enjoy thanks to crackers and zippers. Besides from their seafood by the pound, MUST ORDER CALAMARI! I don't know what is in it or how they make their calamari but it's just the best calamari I have ever had. It was crispier than BC. Every crunch was perfect. Had to grab the other basket from a family member.  Food was great! It was a more enjoyable atmosphere having kind servers as well. Customer service is a huge thing for my family.. Thanks to the man who got our food right and out right away; Peet. And to our other waitress for being on point with water refills and giving us all the lemons we needed; La. And to the lady who took care of us for the rest of the night; Camille.  We will definitely come back on our next visit to vegas.",

Making sure that I don't come here as often as I use to, allows me to look forward to coming back. The garlic smell that lingers for about 24 hours on your mouth and nails tend to steer me away from coming. But other than that, this place is amazing.   The flavors just pop in my mouth, I love it. I usually get shrimp hot & juicy medium. With a side of rice, Cajun fries, and extra butter. I usually get the sauce from the shrimp and put it in the butter and use that as an extra dipping sauce. bomb! I can drink that spicy butter all day! It is very UNHEALTHY but hey, YOLO right?   The staff is pretty Attentive and with another location opening up its not as busy as it used to be before. This location does have limited parking space though which can cause some trouble for me.   And for some reason their raspberry ice tea is amazing. It's probably just regular ol' raspberry ice tea you usually get everywhere but I think with all the spices, the raspberry ice tea just compliments everything lol!",

Came here about 40 minutes before closing on a Thursday with the boyfriend. We were seated right away =) This place is only about 7 minutes away from the strip.   The menu looks just like BC. However, the pricing is mostly Market Price, so no set price like BC. I did notice that they don't offer lobster, clams, and crab (i think).  We ordered 1 lb of shrimp &  2 lb of crawfish w/ half a dozen sausage & corn in their house special sauce in mild. We also ordered cajun fries.  Everything was delicious!! The sauce tasted similar to BC, but not as salty and buttery. Mild was a bit too spicy for me though, boyfriend said it wasn't spicy for him. The crawfish is about 2 times bigger than BC!! Yummmy!! More meat =) You can tell the crawfish is fresh too =) shrimp tasted like BC, but boyfriend said he didn't enjoy it as much.  Everything came out to about $50.  I was satisfied, I would come back for the crawfish.",

I lucked out for a Thursday evening I only waited only around ten minutes to be seated.   I ordered one pound of Hot and spicy Crawfish, one pound of the garlic butter shrimp, and a side of corn on the cob.   The seafood was so tasty fresh and juicy, I ordered mild and it had just the right kick to get you all hot and flustered. The Crawfish were decent sized with a great tasting sauce and the large sized shrimp with heads were awesome tasting. The side of corn was really yummy cus they put garlic butter sauce on - and it's was sweet and delicious.   The restaurant is really casual and I noticed they do a great take out business also. I would really recommend this place especially if your into eating with your hands and getting dirty with your food.",

    "text": "I have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.  Let me start by saying... our waiter, Nick... DAMN. It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face.   It took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment.   I heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.  The food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.  And for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part.",

Since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations.   The staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. They will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed.   The set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. You can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special) as well as the spice level. Then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. You can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. It's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious.   Besides seafood, you could order sides like their Cajun fries or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood.   Fast, fun, and filling, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up.",

If you are not a big seafood fan than I think you might think about this place the same as I did.   I had crawfish, shrimp and crab. I enjoyed two out of the three, though there was a lot of work getting the crawfish and the crab as to be expexted I guess. I enjoyed the shrimp most which I ordered medium with sausage, corn and potatoes. If I come back here again this is what I will be ordering.   Overall for me just an ok place to eat.

They told us the crawfish were frozen as fresh is out of season. We appreciated the honesty.. They were really awesome from frozen anyway... so YAY! I would recommend this place for eating in too since the atmosphere was great and the staff really friendly. Smelled REALLY good in there too. (Medium heat is pretty hot BTW).",

    "text": "Like most Yelpers, I first heard of Hot 'n Juicy from Man vs. Food but the Yelpers seemed mixed on this one so I kept my expectations low.   Even during midday, the parking lot was practically full. I could smell seafood-y goodness wafting through the door. I was seated quickly near a fuzzy TV & the waitress even moved me to a cooler seat. I was wary about service but was pleasantly surprised by the kind & attentive servers.   My friend & I shared 2lb crawfish & 2 lb shrimp mild (my body won't allow me to consume spicy anymore but mild still had a bit of spice). I'm not a fan of Boiling Crab's the Whole Shebang-- I prefer garlic butter-- so I am in the same camp with other Yelper who felt the hot & spicy sauce could use more garlic. I also felt the food could have come out a little hotter temperature-wise.    Water was free, the wait was nonexistent on a Saturday afternoon, parking was easy, they carried $3 bottled Sapporo (is this because it's near Chinatown?), you could add potato, & both they had multiple restrooms (one of my big qualms).  For me, it comes down to the food. Overall impression: Good, not quite Boiling Crab good.",

I have been to Boiling Crab and other places like it in Southern California, but this place is by far- my favorite.  The \"hot n juicy\" sauce is the best I've had.    I came with 2 other people, and we ordered  a calamari appetizer, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and a dungeness crab (2.4 lbs), and a side of rice.  And I am so glad I ordered the rice, because after all of the crustaceans were devoured, the rice was the perfect vessel to soak up the remaining sauce.    Everything was delicious, but the Dungeness Crab was the star.  Every bite was perfection- so meaty, so sweet, so juicy! This is now my go to place to bring Las Vegas visitors!",

We got the hot and juicy combo sauce at the mild spice.  We also ordered rice and I got the etouffe.  Being Filipino, we can't really eat anything without our rice.. and sadly, they ran out of rice and we had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get ours.  They were so nice and apologetic about it that they took the rice off of our bill and gave it to us for free!   The rice came out cooked, but a little on the drier side than I prefer.. I don't know if it was because they were in a hurry to get it out.. or if that's the way they just cook their rice.. either way.. I was glad I had the etouffe to moisten my rice up.  The seafood was pretty good.  The sauce was a little runnier than what I'm used to.. we got to Bucket Crabs and Crawfish in Ontario and their sauce is thicker than here.. and that's something I prefer.    The sauce here at hot and juicy was spicy at the mild level and that's how we like it!  If given a choice, I think I would still prefer Bucket Crabs than here..  it was a nice treat to get to eat at a place featured on TV tho..",

    "text": "Husband and I went twice on this trip to Vegas as we were there for a week.  Our first trip to H&J was a night visit.  Food, perfectly spicy, great service.  Everything great.  Yeah, a small wait, but yes, the food can be just that good so it was ok waiting.  The only disappointment that night were the 2 women that came in to eat.  One wearing a bikini top and one wearing a mesh dress with only a thong on underneath.  She sat down and all I could think was \"booty juice\"... YUK!!!  I know it's a very casual environment, but it's not the pool ladies!!!  I was thankful that the girl was told to put on a top before they would serve them the food.  I just wish the booty girl had to put on shorts or something.  Nasty.  Our 2nd time there, lunch... service was great.  We waited quite some time for the food though... it was odd... We ordered pretty much the same thing, but we certainly got ripped off on the crab legs... I know there was no way possible that we got 2lbs, thus the reason for the 4 star rating.  Yes, of course we'll go back, but only at night.  And, there is a GREAT massage place 2 doors down- yes, a legitimate one.  If you're looking for happy ending, then go to the one next door.  $50 for 90 minutes and it was great.  We had 2 that week.  Also, wonderful pedicure across the street.  Zen Foot is the name of massage place, pedicure is Nails for You.",

    "text": "De-fricken-licious. I had never tried crawfish, but I'm a big seafood lover, so I was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. You order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. You choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. I went with the Hot N Juicy special and \"less than mild.\" Even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (I'll admit, I'm a wimp). Service was okay. We had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. I promise, I'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, I'm not exactly doing my job. Anyways, on to the food:  Snow crab w/ lemon pepper: Absolutely amazing. I don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist I've had. Huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. Don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. It takes it to the next level.  Crawfish w/ Hot N Juicy: Great, but very small. The little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. As a crawfish newbie, I was surprised, but now I know what I'm in for. If you're here for just crawfish, I'd get at least 2 pounds.  Mussels: WOW. Some of the best I've had. I never knew mussels could be so tender! I'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.  Sides: CORN! Get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. Shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. It will be all sorts of juicy goodness. My only regret: not getting more. The fries and sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. Especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, I'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.  Chicken nuggets: As we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. They looked and tasted like they came from some Foster Farms frozen bag. However, since this place is meant for seafood, I don't hold it against the restaurant.",

If you're afraid to suck the crawfish heads and eat all the juicy stuff inside, then shrimp is the way to go.  It's 2 dollars more per pound but you'll also get alot more food with less shell.  I love crawfish more but since I'm from the South I'm used to paying  3-4 bucks a pound.  To fulfill my desires I'll get 2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb crawfish with my friend.  We like to get extra corn and potatoe since it's so yummy.    They tend to understate the heat so a medium is probably hot, and hot is extra.....and so forth.  Great place - definitely check it out!",

I had a pound of their snow crab legs (plus corn and potato) in their very spicy sauce. It was amazing.   The entire meal comes in a plastic bag, good thing I put on the bib! If I had a straw I would drink the rest of the sauce with it! If I had to complain about anything it would have to be that my very spicy sauce wasn't very spicy, actually pretty mild. I am going to assume I got the wrong sauce because I was told it was going to be overwhelming. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, spice, and buttery garlic goodness. The corn and potato were mixed right in with the rest of the meal (yes in the plastic bag), If I hadn't been with a local I wouldn't have know to order this.   I travel to Vegas often enough that this will definitely become my favorite place to go for lunch.",

(haha kidding of course) This is definitely a place to come by if you want to hang out with some friends and family, a very very casual place to eat.  As you know, it's going to get messy.  It was my first time in a place like this, and even me, who's a guy that likes to try new things, I still had to wear gloves when I was eating all the food.  You can choose to not wear gloves, but your hands will stink (especially if you order it hot and juicy, which is all the sauces mixed into one)  Even on a wed night, there was about a 30 minute wait.  The waitstaff is all really cool.  Atmosphere is relaxed.  But eating the food is not as relaxing as the rest of the place.  We were sweating, the food can be very spicy if you want it to be, be careful!  I wouldn't come here on a first date either.  Ripping off shrimp heads awkwardly wearing gloves (or not) may be too much to handle for some people.    I would def come back, it's great place to have a bunch of food and get your seafood craving satisfied.",

You could taste it on the corn but not so much the crawfish.  It seemed like it was not boiled in the sauce and the sauce was tossed on afterwards.  The flavor had not soaked into the crawfish.  I don't usually comment about the cleanliness of bathrooms, but man...these bathrooms were gross.  Trash was everywhere.  Service: Waitress was friendly enough. Looks like the trendy place to be.

The cab driver was a little confused too,  but he said this one was the one that he drops everyone off at.   First off, the servers are very friendly. They might not have been very quick to get our food order or remember to bring everything, but they were all super nice.   There were 6 of us in the group and we decided to order by pairs. It's hard to not share and hard to share with the entire group. You'll see it gets really messy and there's no way of passing things around the table. So the easiest way to eat is to share with the person next to you or across from you.   We ordered the shrimp, crawfish (of course), clams, and king crab legs. You also get a choice of sauce and spiciness. Everyone ordered the hot n juicy sauce (a mix of 3 of the choices). I usually eat my Thai food 4 stars and ordered medium spiciness. It was pretty good for me, although I could have used a little more spice. It might be too spicy for people that don't eat hot foods.   The food comes out in bags and you just dig in with your hands. There's bibs and gloves for everyone (highly recommended). I loved the clams and shrimp. The crab legs didn't have much flavor. The crawfish were just a pain in the ass- a lot of work for nothing. I would probably skip that next time. In fact, everyone in our group was saying how great the food was- EXCEPT for the pain-in-the-ass crawfish :)   I would highly recommend this place. The food is good, service is great, and the atmosphere is so much fun. And prices were not bad if you're used to the astronomical prices on the Strip.",

What is so great about this place is their special sauce..hot and juicy special! I get it medium spice level, if I do spicy (which I have) my lips start to puff up. But the medium is still pretty spicy. I've also had their snow crab, Alaskan crab, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries...all very good.   BEWARE you will smell like garlic after leaving this place. And your fingers will smell for two days. The secret to getting the smell out of your fingers is to rub lemon juice after u are done (and I mean a lot of lemon juice).

Lets see, started with oysters on half shell, 2 lb crawfish, fried calamari, 1 lb shrimp, the the King Crab Legs for dessert! We were pretty full then decided we had to try the crab legs and MAN AM I GLAD WE DID!   You soak those crab leg meat in their spicy sauce and you are as close to orgasm without stimulation as humanly possible! I think my wife had that \"Sleepless in Seattle\" moment ala Meg Ryan! haha priceless!  Not only was the food THE BEST, but the Staff was just outstanding. They helped us decide what to order and were very attentive without being intrusive. Outstanding!  Unless you like it really spicy, just order Mild, cuz that is spicy enough...Trust, we're asians and like our spices, but mild was plenty spicy for us!  Just another \"must visit\" place everytime we hit Vegas.",

Here's a tip: Ask for a side of melted butter to cut the spiciness if you need to.  This was one of the longest, messiest meals of my life. No fault of the restaurant; crawfish takes a lot of digging.  When it was all said and done, I ordered a side of rolls (three to an order) and mopped up all that luscious, amazing, spicy sauce in the bottom of the bag, even though I had no room.  DAMN! That's good!  And, yes, I had heartburn for a full day afterwards.",

This is by far (and don't worry I edit) the BEST crawfish shack I've ever grubbed at.  The crawfish is literally piping HOT and JUICY.  I ordered the house seasoning, which was finger-licking-good!  There are two bummers though-- one, it's pricey &  two, it gets packed.    Of all the things to gamble on, this is a sure bet! ;)  FYI-All the fancy pants eaters have been forewarned because this place is for those that aren't afraid of getting nitty-gritty with their food!",

    "text": "I can honestly admit I'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?  The ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!  After leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.  My colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.  Our waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!  As I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a True fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped.   The seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?  My next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.  A fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.  ------------------------------------  *In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC. They have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.",

Once we moved here to Vegas I had tried out boiling crab here and it was disgusting! So here I was in search of a new place to fulfill cravings...and I can honestly tell you that hot n juicy is BETTER than boiling crab! Seriously it's delicious. I went back to San Jose's boiling crab a few days after I had hot n juicy and it does not compare! Their sauce has an extra kick to it and they use less butter for sure. I am a definite fan of this place now.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is Sin City for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy.   Hot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy).   We ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.  The crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices.   I've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.  Etouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.  The boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.  The final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.",

It was \"okay\" the catfish was not spicy so we ordered a side of hot and juicy medium sauce to dip it in. Fries were also just okay nothing special just some fries sprinkled with creole seasoning.  Then we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish with corn, potatoes and sausage with medium hot and juicy sauce. The crawfish was great!!! Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually. The sauce is a mixture of all of their sauces and it has a ton of garlic in it!! I love garlic!!  The potatoes and sausage were yummy, not a fan of the corn. At home we throw in mushrooms and I think they should too because I was missing it..  Last but not least we ordered corn fritters. These deep fried wonderful tasty treats were my favorite of the meal and to think I wasn't going to order it!!! It came with ranch sauce to dip but you need to ask for a side of sorracho sauce (chili sauce) just a little dip of it and it's soooo good!!   We will definitely return, but I think I will try the one in Orange County.",

    "text": "So I just flew into Vegas tonight and pretty much headed straight here after checking into my hotel. What can I say, I was fiending. While I was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal Boiling Crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love BC), I decided to give it a shot. So, let me reiterate that I have been to both Boiling Crab and Hot n Juicy, and each has their pros and cons. I personally think they stack up pretty well (and I have reviewed both).  Pros for Hot n Juicy:  1. Wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. It was a \"slow\" night for them (Monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. While we were waiting, C and I searched their wall of Polaroids for Adam Richman's...of course, he had his own frame.  2. Wait staff was friendly. Our server Amanda was excellent. She checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. After it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. I think that their wait staff is WAY nicer than BC's. They say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. Who'd have thought.  3. Price is pretty good. After reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of BC's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), sweet potato fries, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. I saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.  4. They have a full bar.  Cons for Hot N Juicy:  1. Their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. We had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.  2. Restaurant is a lot smaller than BC. If you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. That's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a Saturday.  3. You walk out of there smelling like crap. But...you would at BC too. So I guess that's not much of a con.  In terms of the food...the level was about the same, although I will say this (and I hope it makes sense): while H&J was a little bit spicier, BC had more flavor to it. My friend and I both liked the sweet potato fries here better than at BC. The size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at H&J. Beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. You really can't beat $3 for a Corona. Both places have TVs, which at the time were playing the Lakers game.  If I was in town again, I would probably end up going back. It's no BC, but it fills the void.  I'd give it 3 3/4 stars, but I round up because I'm nice.",

    "text": "When this first opened it pretty much didn't have much competition, that is no longer True. We have eaten there numerous times and the food is good. We love the crab, so sweet and meaty, even the snow crab. The sausage is perfect, crisp skin and just the right amount of spice. The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know. Never the less, it's always a very good meal. But we have had better now. Don't get me wrong it's awesome food. Service is hit or miss. They are just so busy. But even really busy I have had an awesome male server.  These are my negatives 1.) What is up with the tiny, tiny plastic ramekin for all those fries?? Seriously? Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin. I don't consider myself the queen of common sense but I feel like I am dealing with servers that might not have the sense of urgency and common sense gene! If you are busy, wouldn't you just say  \"F it, let me bring her the freaking bottle, because I don't have time for crazy ketchup lady!! \" ?  But no, again comes that plastic ramekin of 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Oh, OK I have calmed down, please excuse my rant. I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about the ketchup, I will get over it and move on. ( I don't mean to offend any of those servers they do work hard and service really isn't bad) Plus, I haven't been there in a few months, so maybe things have changed.  Negative #2) The seating is a little congested for my liking. Tables are way to close together. I do understand it's a small place, so it's to be expected. But for me, when I want to relax and enjoy a meal this venue isn't appetizing to me.  3.) 2 restrooms, again it's limited spacing so I understand. But it doesn't mean I like it. And no bar to wait until your table is ready. Maybe I am spoiled. I don't like sitting, if you are lucky to get a seat ,Like I am waiting for a bus outside.  Well, in conclusion, is it good food.? Yes it's great! I chose to come here when the negatives are not going to bother me. When I am hungry and want to grub and I don't care who sees or what I see!",

    "text": "I've been to many Boiling Crabs across CA so I was anticipating a lot from Hot N Juicy. I ordered: 1/2 lb shrimp with 1/2 dozen sausage, corn, cajun fries, and I tried some of my friends' oysters and crawfish. Got Mild with Hot N Juicy seasoning.   Firstly, prices were a little steeper than BC, maybe $1-2 higher. Dived into the food and after a few bites, my mouth was ON FIRE. Seriously. I got Mild, the lowest spice setting and I had to stop eating a few times because my mouth was suffering. I got the sweats, Corona & water didn't help, and my stomach even hurt a bit. You might call me weak and maybe I am, but I order a Mild at BC and I have no problem finishing a Whole Shabang there.   It was so spicy that I could barely taste the seasoning. The corn was mushy/soggy. The sausages were good, but still had the same level of insane heat. Oysters were bigger than I'd like, I prefer mine small and sweet.   Overall, the most memorable part of my meal were the sausages and the saltine/oyster/horseradish/cocktail sauce combo. Boiling Crab over Hot N Juicy any day.",

    "text": "Attended an awesome UYE last night and had a blast getting messy with some of Yelp's finest. My family is from New Orleans so I grew up on crawfish and crab boils. My standards are pretty high for crawfish and this place delivered!   They have so many flavors and spice levels to choose from ! We got the 2 lbs of crawfish with the Hot & Juicy Special flavor with no spice. I know that sounds lame, but trust me, the \"no spice\" is still plenty hot. The mild is more like a medium and medium = HOT. Be careful when you order here people! The waitress steered us to the \"no spice\" and I'm very thankful she did. They were perfect.   We also got 1 lb of the snow crab. The snow crab were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. Absolutely no comparison to the snow crab you get on the buffet lines !   Soo the biggest con about this place is its' hella EXPENSIVE! I honestly could throw down 4-5 lbs of crawfish in one sitting but at $9.99 a freaking lb I couldn't justify spending $50 on dinner when I could get a steak at the nicest steak restaurant in Vegas for that price. I guess I'm spoiled coming from TX and New Orleans where crawfish over $5 a lb is considered highway robbery!! My mom died when I told her I spent $9.99 on crawfish. I know we're in the desert so we have to pay a premium for everything, but geez... I wish I could say I'll be returning frequently, but with my appetite for crawfish I can only afford to eat here every once in awhile!!",

After tracking down the waitress, we finally got out snow crabs and they were comped due to the screw up.  That's the way it should be so we will come back soon and see how things go the second time around  The seafood in a bag of juice is kinda weird, but better than I thought it would be, so I give then a big thumbs up",

    "text": "The crawfish here were DELICIOUS. And a little warning, please trust them when they tell ya Spicy means SPICY. Believe it or your lips would feel like they are burning.  And their secret recipe (the Hot & Juicy flavor) is the way to go, sooo hot and soooo juicy! =P   Besides the crawfish, their shrimps are also delicious; tender, juicy, and very flavorful as well. We did not try the King Crab leg, which looked amazing when some lady cracked those shells and pulled out a whole long strip of crab meat. Holy cow, wish I could go back now and get some!   Oh oh, and their sweet potato fries are soooo sooo good. It was the first time when I did not find any soggy fries in the bunch and every single one of them was perfectly fried (crispy) and sweet! Oh man...  Besides the food, the service here is very friendly; they are very busy, but everybody still greet the customers with smiles and are knowledgeable with recommendations...another thumbs up. The shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water. Guess it gives you a seafood shack type of feel and most importantly, easier to clean as they can just wrap everything in the paper table cloths and throw away. Maybe should consider recycling cuz that's just a lot of paper and plastic everyday?   Now that I've done my Let's Save Earth Ad, allow me to HIGHLY recommend this place if you know you are a crawfish fan....a MUST in Vegas.",

Whatever seasoning I choose, I always ask them to not make it spicy; as mild as possible, yes I am a wuss.  Though crawfish is in their name, go for the shrimp because that is the best bang for the buck.  There is more meat and you do not have to fight for the little meat that you get in the crawfish.  The cajun fries are tasty also.  Pros: great service, great food  Cons: small parking lot  Definitely a place to stop by while in Vegas.  It is not really too far off the strip.",

    "text": "After seeing this place on Man vs. Food and multiple pictures on my friend's Facebook page, I had to make a pit stop here while I was in Vegas.  The crawfish was good but super duper exceptionally bodaciously spicy.  You order the crawfish by the pound and it was $9.99 a pound and get to choose the seasoning sauce.  The specialty here is the hot and spicy, which you then get to choose mild, medium or hot.  Let me tell you, even if you can eat really spicy food, choose mild because it's going to so burn going in and coming out!  I can usually handle spicy food very well but found the mild here to be really hot.  The garlic in the hot and spicy sauce really came through and made the crawfish really really good!  In fact I think this place is even better than the crawfish boil restaurants that I've been to in both New Orleans and Houston.   We came here on a Thursday night and found it to be about half full which was to our surprise because we had heard it can be at least a 30-40 minute on weeknights and longer on weekends.  I guess we just lucked out.  3% discount if you pay in cash.  The total for the two of us came to $41 dollars with tax and tip; this included 2 pounds of crawfish, sweet potato fries, beer, rice and extra corn and potato.    Awesomeness is achieved here and this time man won, at least until his visit with the porcelain goddess later in the evening!",

    "text": "I, too, saw the segment on Man v. Food and was immediately intrigued.  A crawfish place in Nevada?  And it's supposed to be GOOD?  Hmmm..  Alright, you got me.  Let's go.  Touched down in Vegas at 5pm, checked into the hotel, and took a cab off the Strip to Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  It was a Monday night, and yet, the wait time for a table was 45 minutes!  Wow, really??  I was irritated, but at the same time, I was excited.  This must be really good if all these locals are lined up here waiting for crawfish!  After pacing back and forth and continually asking the waiters if our table was ready for about 45 minutes, we finally got seated.  Our table was buzzing with anticipation.  I ordered two pounds of the Garlic Butter ($10.99/ per lb.).  They have a lot of other seafood as well, but I came here for the crawfish!   And it was DELICIOUS!  They weren't as big as I've had them, but they were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was amazing.    After we finished eating, I was a bit startled when I got the bill.  $10.99 per pound of crawfish??  Supermarkets in Dallas sell crawfish for less than $2 a pound!  I guess you have to factor in the cost of shipping fresh crawfish from Louisiana all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada - which apparently they do EVERY day.    Is this the best crawfish I've ever had?  I'd say it's on par with the Boiling Crab, which is my favorite crawfish place in Dallas.  And it's only $4.99 a pound there!   However, if you're in Vegas, there's not a whole lot of alternatives.  If you love fresh crawfish, this is the place to go.   Pros: fresh crawfish, garlic butter seasoning is delicious  Cons: $10.99 a pound!  Always busy, expect a long wait time",

Then my fiance's cousin said something about Hot-n-Juicy and it somehow just stuck in my head. So yea,, Patrick and I in Vegas, properly buzzed and ready to throw down on some good sea bugs. Let's activate the Lyft and get a ride to Hot-n-Juicy heaven.  We walk in and we were immediately greeted, \"Welcome to Hot-n-Juicy!\"  \"Table for two please.\"  She smiles, takes a couple of bibs and menus, \"Right this way please.\"  We told her that it was our first time here and she told us the popular items,, crawfish and shrimp is their main draw. Their Hot-n-Juicy flavor is their most popular and we can choose from mild, medium and hot.  Ok, so a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and an order of the dungeness crab. All hot-n-juicy, all hot spicy. The shrimp and crawfish arrives first. We start with the shrimp which was properly done. Not too rare and not too over cooked that it sticks to the shell. Just perfect, and the sauce a perfect combination. Then comes the crawfish, which was pretty much the best crawfish I have ever had so far. My gosh, their house sauce is just to die for. The crawfish is just the perfect vessel for all the garlicky spicy goodness. Then the dungeness crab comes... man oh man is it good. If you don't know how to properly eat a whole crab,,, please learn, you're missing out on this. If not,, then please don't even enter this place,,, just go back to your hotel and order room service. Get yourself chicken fingers and friend potato sticks,, trust me,, you'll have a wonderful time with that instead.  We had an AWESOME experience here. We even ordered an extra pound of crawfish because it was that freakin good. Next time I'm in town for some good seafood YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS moments to enter my mouth. Uh-huh,,, that's for real!  I love you Hot-n-Juicy.",

The One guy that was serving was helpful in handling our check and he wasn't even our server. Maybe our server just started our something.  The bonus about this joint vs any other crab/shrimp place is they have disposable gloves. They also have the little towlettes but never bring them to you until they bring your check. A little too late by then, just sayin'. They're sauces are nice though and their fritters are bomb ($5.95)",

Overall they had a bad attitude all throughout the time we were there. Not to mention, it took 20 minutes to get 4 cups of rice. And when we asked about it, they became defensive. As for the food, the food was delicious, i just wish they gave us the servings we asked for... and the crawfish was practically empty. But for the food we did receive, the flavor was amazing. So I would recommend going to a Hot n Juicy, but definitely not this one.",

Coming from Houston, we have more varieties and better quality crawfish places available. The flavor was on point but the crawfish itself was quite disappointing. It was mushy and tastes odd. A few of them even tastes rotten to me or perhaps it was already dead. However, I do like their boiled shrimps! jumbo boiled shrimp in a hot & spicy sauce.. definitely succulent. I've been to this establishment in Orlando before and it was amazing there so I was hoping for the same wow factor here  but didn't get it. I'll try again the next time I visit Vegas because I have high hopes for this restaurant.",

The first time he ordered 2lbs of crawfish with Hot N Juicy medium and I ordered 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of crab legs Hot N Juicy spicy. Oh, let's not forget a basket of Cajun fries to share. Let's just say we were both sweating! The waiter said the spice level can vary based on the cook and my guess is the cook that night was heavy handed. We both enjoyed it, however, the service wasn't that great due to the crowd. The waitress apologized but I told her it was okay because we came for the food and not the service.  The second time we came we ordered the same thing only my boyfriend also got 1lb of blue crab. The food was once again great! The service was better and I am guessing it was because we came during lunch rather than the evening. The only thing I will say about the blue crab is that if you are not a professional at eating full crabs you may want to start with crab legs first. I watched my boyfriend eat it for the first time and it just seemed like so much work!  Overall I definitely recommend this place to anyone! I have never ate at another location so I can't speak for the others. I prefer this one because it is the original. However, there is another one right down the street.  Plenty of parking in the area, no waiting, always a correct order, and they provide gloves (I never use them) if you prefer not to get down and dirty.",

The best part of our experience is that she was really up beat and took the time to interact with her tables! The place was busy last night. I heard it's typically busy or a rush for them between the hours of 5-10. The atmosphere was a great vibe. They play really good throwback musics.   But going back to the food... One of their must try seasoning is the hot n juicy. If you don't want to do any of the cracking or peelings grab some fried food. Order the sauce on the side and dip your food in.   Will be coming back to this location!",

I like getting extra spicy and soaking my shrimp in the sauce after peeling it.   Their clams are also really large in size but unfortunately most of them were no where to be found....I pulled out at least 7 empty shells at once trying to find one with some meat in them...I didn't know if I should tell the waitress or whether or not she would believe me. In the end I didn't but I know I should have !!   Their catfish is also really good but be careful it comes out hot ! They also forgot about our order so we had to wait to get it while everyone else already had their food. Cajun fries were also not impressive when compared to boiling crab.   Their best feature is definitely their sauce ! Would recommend just going for their shrimp and clams if you're lucky to get shells that aren't empty ( didn't get to try their crawfish).",

I had such high hopes for them but it was a let down.   Decent amount of seating. Located in Chinatown. Service was good.  Hot n Juicy style was supposed to be a flavor bomb but it was lacking. None of the flavors popped, not even the garlic. Whole Shabang from BC has a lot more flavor.   Shrimp - $14.99 per pound Crawfish - $12.99 per pound  The seafood does come frozen. But the batch we got was terrible. The meat ended up being really mussy. It lost all its bite.   Big disappointment.",

    "text": "Finally (after the 6th mention of \"I'd really like to try Hot & Juicy\"), we made it there last night.  We ordered the catfish basket, king crab legs (juicy cajun- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob.   First off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. You have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. Second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. We wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.    We both personally enjoyed the juicy cajun sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. I think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. We liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. It was really good that way! The fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. The king crab was a little over $20 for two legs. I would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. I had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause king crab legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them.   I have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that I can recall). I thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, I just tore that sucker apart and dug in. Well worth the work, I must say.  The corn was delicious as well. Yum. Overall, a great place and lots of fun. I would really recommend it!!",

    "text": "Crawfish is good. Mainly because they are larger here than most other places ive seen. This place, the little guys were big enuf that you could pull the meat out with minimal effort. Ive been to places where you sit there peeling back the shell and when you're done, the meat is almost gone because it got squished between your fingers and gets lost in a boatload of shells.  The seasoning is good, although a bit oily from the butter. The spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.  We also ordered the King Crab which tasted OK but it definietly wasnt fresh. You can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  When you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.  For $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.    All in all, it was a fun experience we thank Adam Richman for telling us about.  BTW, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible. The sweltering vegas desert heat doesnt help much either. The smell after leaving the restaurant was mortifying.",

I watch this place grow so busy over the last several years now and im so happy for the owners that this place became a huge success.   I want to make a very True  and clear point here because its just very dissappointing to find out to hear what people will do for vengeance to make a fabulous place like this shut down.  To the person who loves to spread False information and to put it on this on the news is completely outright wrong! and secondly karma is a bitch cause you messed up in the first place...hate it to say it to the folks but this place is NOT going to shut down.  There will ALWAYS be dissatisfied customers no matter what! no matter what! Honestly,  this place is not gonna make everyone happy, i mean, what business out there does???? this IS america people! we love to complain, and all the better, we loooove to sue each others ass off!!   All I can tell you is that since ive been coming here along with all the waaaaay tooooo many people i referred this place to and i rarely ever got a bad response, and only a few times i did get one its because they were either 1) don't eat seafood 2) extremely fickle picky eaters.  but this place is outstanding, and consistent, its always freaking busy! so the customer service is not always gonna be 110% on top of things, your not coming here for superb service, your coming here for seafood cajun style and  of course, if you like it \"SPICY\". if your a customer and you demand perfect food along with perfect service go take yourself to a 5 star rated michelin awarded restaurant cause theres a few here in vegas, and spend your $500  + worth of experiencing excellent dining.   Other than that,  ive said what i needed to say. Nonetheless, hot and juicy, when it comes to great seafood and spice and BLUECRABS, you never fail me, you just make me and all the rest of your fans from vegas, l.a., the bay, and everyone else from all over,coming back for MORE!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "5 of us went in on Thursday. The food is really awesome. But they need to train their wait staff there. These kids are the worse, they never come back to refill your drinks and when they do they filled it up with water. Then instead of taking care of their customers, they are sitting in the back tables talking and texting on their phones. Waited more than 30 minutes before I had to go up and ask our waiter for the bill, could not even look at me, because he was to busy texting. Had one of his buddies drop off the check with no apologies, and walks right out the door. then has the nerve to add on the tip, where if he had taken care of his customers they way he should have. He would have gotten tipped at least 30% instead of the 17% he added on. We order appetizers, we got them after our main meals, like 20 mins. later. Not happy, because I am in the same industry, but then again I know how to take care of my customers, since the tips that they are so kind to give to me helps put food on my table and a roof over my head. I need to find a new place to eat, BOILING CRAB maybe.",

Our friend found a review for Hot N Juicy online and we decided to try it out.  The food was great (AND HOT), if you go, be prepared to get greasy and have really good spicy cajun/creole food.  The owners were friendly and made sure we had enough to eat and drink. The timing of all the food coming out was a little off, but I think that will improve with them only being open a couple of months when we went.  The only bad thing for visitors is getting back to your hotel if you don't have a rental car. The taxi situation near Chinatown is not good at nights (especially on weekends). If you have your own car... head west on Spring Mountain Road, and be ready for a good ol' fashioned crawfish broil...",

The clams were not washed well and had sand bits in them. Anyone who's bit into a grain of sand knows what I'm talking about. The catfish basket was more expensive, had a subpar batter and had much less catfish than they give at BC. One thing I'll give them credit for is their shrimp...big and super fresh. BC has tendency for old shrimp that become mushy, so this is one area BC could improve on.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Hot N Juicy,  I highly recommend going.  Hot N Juicy is a restaurant like no other.    A few fair warnings:  be prepared to wait for a table (I waited 35 minutes), if you are sensitive to the smell of garlic and/or fish - stay away, if you're from the Northwest and enjoy spending your time volunteering to help save the environment (just be prepared to see lots of styrofoam and plastic), and if you don't like peeling seafood and eating it with you hands while wearing a bib - go to Red Lobster.  I ordered the one pound shrimp bag, hot n juicy style, medium spiciness - highly recommended!  Once I adopted a proper peeling technique, I began chomping away at the marinated shrimps.  One pound was plenty for me, and since I'm a slower peeler, my stomach filled up by the time I was done eating the bag.  Having previously lived on the Monterey Peninsula, I am picky when it comes to seafood (especially shrimp), so I was pleased with Hot N Juicy.  The shrimp was quite delicious!    I don't think this will be a weekly or monthly restaurant of choice for me, but I'll enjoy taking my friends here who haven't ever tried it before.    I had a side of fries too, but I think next time, I want to try the rice.  I think the seasoning and juices mixed with white rice would be yummy!  NOTE: If you're not into the atmosphere of the restaurant, try carry-out!  It's definitely something you don't want to miss out on!",

Of fresh ones,  so we got frozen,  and got half pound of shrimp.  The seafood was a big size,  had to order 2lb of crawfish to get corn & potato. We got the hot n spicy special with medium hotness. It was really spicy! If you're use to spice maybe itll be fine, but next time ill get mild,  which im sure will be my medium. The sauce was definitely worth it,  flavored the shrimp so well. The same sauce was use for crawfish, was still good,  but since it was frozen,  the sauce didnt seep through the crawfish for flavor,  it was a little bland/taste of water after u defrost any seafood. But it was still good.  I can only imagine what the fresh ones will be like! And the frozen crawfish were also cheaper.  Service was fast and food was good. Definitely glad we went oit of our ways for it.",

I said I did have it before and the waiter even agreed it did look the same. They gave me a side of garlic butter after the meal was over. They let me know they look very similar and that I was wrong. I told our waiter and the waitress that I have had it before and it did not taste the same. The girl let me know that with different seafoods it tastes different........ I understand different seafood tastes differently that's why I ordered something different in a different sauce!!!! The sauce was definitely hot n juicy and I didn't like how they kept insisting that the sauce wasn't the same.   Anyways. Food was okay. Service was awful.

It looked EXACTLY like The Boiling Crab in California and right then and there I knew I would be heading down to Hot N Juicy for a meal while I was in Vegas.  It's a seafood place were you order seafood by the pound.  You then choose what type of sauce you want your seafood brought to you in.  They have lemon pepper, cajun, garlic butter etc and you can choose a level of spiciness.  You can also get items added to your seafood like sausage, corn and potatoes.    They have the regular sides like rice, fries etc.  Once you place your order they bring you a bib and a few minutes later you're brought a bag of delicious juiciness with the seafood that you ordered.  This time I ordered a pound of snow crabs in lemon pepper sauce and a pound of shrimp in cajun sauce.  I got my order a little spicy.  They were both fantastic and at a pretty reasonable price.  The shrimp was $10 and the snow crabs were $17 per pound each.  You're guaranteed to be a mess after this meal so you might as well get down and dirty!",

Hot N Juicy is the rare exception to this rule.  Breaking into crawfish and sucking the juice from their heads is messier than one would expect.    I can vouch for the crawfish, crab legs and lobster.  I'm also a huge fan of the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning.  I have kind of a \"When in Rome\" approach to food ... if something is a specialty or a namesake, more often than not it's damn good.  When I lived in Vegas, I would frequent this place often and bring visitors from out of town here.  Never a dissatisfied experience or visitor.  A few thing to keep in mind though ... expect to wear a bib and smell like Hot N Juicy for the rest of the day ... maybe into the next day.  This place is also crowded, expect to wait ... It's well worth the wait though.  Hot N Juicy is an experience, be ready to get your hands dirty.",

    "text": "BAGS AND BAGS OF CRUSTACEANS YES PLEASE!!!   We drove by this place and I'm like, \"Hey!  I think I read about this place on Yelp!\".  We waited for about 10 minutes on a Saturday night and then got a booth.    Our waitress was super helpful guiding us through the different flavors and the types of seafood.  We eventually settled on 2 pounds of crawfish and 0.5 pound of shrimp.  i think next time, 1 pound of shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound of crab/lobster.  Crawfish heads had tons of flavor BUT paying per pound is working against you with crawfish because it's all shell....at least shrimps have thin shells!    Order with beer, order some bread to dip into the sauce.  Wear clothes that you don't like because you WILL STINK like garlic for days to come.  I saw one table with plastic gloves on which may be a good idea....but then I think you lose a bit of the experience if you use gloves.    Do GO!  This is a MUST DO OFF STRIP experience!!!!",

    "text": "Where do I begin? I am a little lost for words for this place. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of Boiling Crab, so I was looking forward to an improved experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish. Boy, was I wrong! Since I'm not a fan of peeling shrimps and breaking off the head, I decided to order calamari. I love calamari, so I was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. Unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. The calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! How in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! Second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. I was so disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. However, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. The waitress offered to comp my food and asked if I wanted to order something different. I was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. I was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since I'm in Vegas.   Great customer service earned this place two stars and their fried shrimp. The fried shrimp tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. In my opinion, they serve better shrimp than Boiling Crab. As for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. My sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with Cajun fries. The chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. So, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. Also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. They don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. I was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much I was looking forward to their calamari. Those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry Tabasco sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!",

    "text": "First, a disclaimer: I moved here from Southern California and my parents still live in Orange County so I probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (Boiling Crab, Claws, etc...) at least every month.  Hot N Juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  The waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  The service is consistent and commendable.  However, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  Let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from Vietnamese people living in New Orleans, loving crawfish, Cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  The Viet crawfish craze started in Houston, jumped to Westminster, and spread nationwide.  Hot N Juicy is the Las Vegas response to a community that contains a sizable Vietnamese population.  They caught their lucky break from appearing on the Travel Channel.  But they cannot be the representative for the Vietnamese Cajun crawfish subculture.  Which brings me back to sauce: Hot N Juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  Besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  There is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something Boiling Crab & Claws in Orange County do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.  There is one thing I love here, which are the sweet potato fries, fried to perfection with the right crisp.  I'll go to Hot N Juicy if my Vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, I'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service.",

I never had crawfish in my life and I tried them.  They are okay, but seem like a lot of work.  I prefer the shrimp myself.  The flavors that they toss the seafood in is just awesome.  Lots of garlic and spice goodness.  Great when they add a potato and corn into the bag so they too soak up the flavors.  A little messy, so you want to go with people you are comfortable with and takes time to eat your food, so don't go when you are in a rush!  Only thing that could see being an issue for some if you are weird like me, the shrimp are in their shell with the heads on, so you have to take the heads off and they are not deviened, so that could be a little gross to think about.  I ate a whole bag to myself and I didn't get sick, nothing to worry about.   Prices are by the pound, so it can add up!    Quite messy, so just be ready and use all the paper towels they give you.  I would also bring lots of gum for the garlic breath after too!",

The pound of crawfish and fried soft shell crab smelt incredibly good on the way home.   Firstly, this was the first time I've eaten crawfish so seeing the little buggers sort of eeked me out.  Twisting the head, pulling the first part of the shell and then pinching the tail as stated in the article was tricky at first.  Thats a lot of work for a small piece of succulent meat.  The all in one sauce has that spicy touch and is delicious.  Will definately go back there again.",

    "text": "I love crawfish, and seeing as how i go to Boiling Crab in southern CA all the time, I wanted to give this place a try.  Needless to say my whole family was very disappointed. The sauce was very bland, it was not as good as home.  There was nothing significant about the sauce. It was just essentially a bag of spicy water.  We ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp, 12 sausages, 6 corns, and 2 cajun fries. What made me upset the most was the fact that they weighed in the corn with our shrimp (Note to Hot N Juicy Crawfish: When customers order 2 pounds of shrimp, they expect two pounds of SHRIMP, NOT .03 pounds of shrimp and the rest were corn and sausages. Those items are considered side orders, even if you do put them together in the same bag, YOU DON'T WEIGH THEM).  Highly disappointed in this place! I will not be coming back.",

While ordering, it was difficult to communicate with the server because the place was so loud. You have to shout to make sure the employees or those in your party hear what you're saying. Then everyone else in the restaurant does the same, which makes for a very noisy place.   I don't really like crawfish because it kind of creeps me out having my food staring at me, but that's my fault, so I won't hold it against them. The crawfish were hot, and they were juicy. I can tolerate SOME heat/spice, so we ordered mild crawfish. The mild is quite spicy, so I think the \"hot\" should probably be illegal. The crab we ordered with only garlic butter. The crab was obviously low quality, probably on par with what you would find at the cheap buffets. It tasted like a mouthful of sea foam. They can probably get away with serving low quality shellfish because most people put on the hot seasoning and can't taste anything else.",

I have been going to Hot N' Juicy ever since the Man v Food filming for the Travel channel show. I have to say that every time I have been there the service has been more than accommodating. The waitresses are very sweet and pretty and all the servers and staff are beyond friendly.   As for the food, you really can't go wrong with a big ol' bag of snow crab legs and shrimp. I always get at least a dozen sausage and oysters to go with them. The sauces are out of this world good. My friend and I always get the nosebleed sauce on the side so we can just dip everything in it and use the rice on the side to cool down. It is an exhilarating experience. This place is hands down a one-of-a-kind experience for those in Vegas. I have lived here my whole life and have not found such an inexpensive restaurant that offers this kind of experience to this scale.   IMPORTANT: All the claims of sanitation issues and health violations are completely FALSE! They have recently been checked by the state health department and have been cleared of all False accusations.  Please don't let a few negative words fool you on this joint. Just go there and try for yourself. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "They Bleed Garlic  We all have our flavor obsessions.  Some of us need lots of salt in a dish, while others tend to follow their sweet tooth.  For those of you who crave garlic, Hot N' Juicy Crawfish is your mecca, you should make your pilgrimage.    This place is all about one thing, and that is the food.  Generally speaking, you will not use plates or silverware here, just your hands.  The small paper menu features a few items, which can be ordered in a variety of styles.  Tables are topped with a roll of paper towels, and a garbage bag as a table cloth.  Normally I balk at the idea of wearing a gimmicky bib at a restaurant, but when your server brings you a bib, PUT IT ON.  This meal is a hot n' juicy mess.    Last night we had a pound of the king crab legs cooked \"Hot N' Juicy special\" style (think chinatown meets the bayou, or Mulan meets The Frog Princess if you're a Disney fanatic)  We also had a pound of crawfish the same way.    The King Crab Legs ($20 a lb. right now) were huge, meaty, and succulent.  The meat eagerly came out of the shell, as if it was waiting all day for me to eat it.   We also ordered a pound of the crawfish.  The only issue I had with these tiny dancers was that they're typically out of season this time of year.  The ones brought to the table were small, like the size of a medium shrimp.  They were tasty, but it is a lot of work for what amounts to a mento-sized morsel of meat.   Be ready to emanate garlic from your pores for a few hours after the meal, but its totally worth the aroma.  This is a great alternative date spot, since it is messy, casual, and reasonably priced.    Messy + Casual + Reasonably priced = Delicious Fun!",

Make sure you use the protective gear they give you, cuz it can be messy. Also gloves are helpful as well so your fingers don't smell like garlic for the next two days. All in all this is probably my new favorite spot on Spring Mountain or even maybe Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I was afraid that I would have to wait a few hours to get into this place.  Just went here last night with a friend around 6:30pm and we were seated right away.  Awesome!  But then again, there were larger groups of people who were still waiting outside, so maybe it's a good idea to come in smaller groups!  It was also Labor Day.  We ordered the following items: 1 lb. of shrimp 1 lb. of craw fish a couple ears of corn each Sweet potato fries  and we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.  Boy was it NOT mild.  It was super hot!  But it was so good.  The sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  The juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  You must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.    This place is pretty good, and comparable to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area, maybe even better in my opinion.  I have to go back and check as I've only been there once.    Not sure this would be a good date night, but I like a man who can take in some spice.  I find it very flattering!  So why not, bring your date here, see if he can pass the hot test!  You will have fun with the interactive eating, and the get down and dirty environment; bibs and all!  YUM!  I'll be back here soon, once I get this garlic and seafood smell off me for awhile.  It certainly sticks to your clothes so don't bother going out after eating here!",

Most of other crawfish places are salty, too much butter, and drowned in powder. This place is different. When I saw the bag of crawfish, I only saw crawfish, not a bag of red sauce. Fries were crisp and spiced! Service was great. Love it!",

I like the different variations of seafood they have at this place.          It was a little crowded when I got there, but only 30 mins or so.  After getting seated I already knew what I wanted, so I ordered the hot juicy special snowcrab, crawfish, and shrimp.  I put my bib on and waited for my order with my ice cold heineken.  Once the food got there I went to town with it.           I love the idea of using my hands to man handle the food.

Hot N Juicy delivers delicious bags of crawfish, crab, shrimp, sausage, and other creole favorites.

The seafood in general is average..  My shrimp was a little overcooked - but still very tasty. It did not seem really fresh - perhaps it was frozen. The sauce is good and completes the meal.    The service was a little slow - make sure your drink is full as your food arrives or you may get stuck with hot-mouth!  I gave this place 4 stars because it is out in the desert. I love NOLA and I'm from Florida.. so I have high standards for seafood and cajun.  I am a True believer in fresh from the boat to your table. This is not really possible out here and these guys do an excellent job and have a really nifty theme. The place was packed and people seemed to be enjoying their meals on a saturday afternoon.",

Had some rice with it, which was fresh sticky rice and some fresh corn on the cob which they put the spiciest sauce on it. Had some cajun calamari which is good but the shrimp was WOW. Amazing joint, will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I have been coming to this hot n juicy for years. Sad to say the service and quality of seafood has gone downhill. I rarely post negative reviews, but in a day in age where people work hard for there money and like to treat themselves to a dinner out with friends and family this is not the restaurant I would choose. Ate here last night with my cousin and friend. We were greeted by a good runner she was a Asian girl who had thee worst attitude. She should have not been on the floor. Her energy and interaction with us was enough for me to not even order food and walk out. At first our sever was nice, that didn't last very long. We got there around 8:20 PM you could tell the servers were rushing everyone out of the restaurant and tables were neglected because they were doing side work. All because they wanted to go home. This is now the 2nd time that I've eaten at hot n Juicy where I've woken up sick from the seafood. Then they proceed to bring out 1 persons order first which was all of the fried food. So 2 of us were sitting there for 10 minutes waiting for our food. It would've been nice to eat together. I had to wait another 10 minutes after getting my crab legs to get my rice which I like to eat with my seafood. I was given attitude twice when asking for my rice cause I like to eat everything a certain way (which I don't feel like I need to explain to anyone just give me my rice with my crab legs). Don't spend your hard earned money here. Not worth it whatsoever. I'm defiantly making a call to management.",

    "text": "After passing by this place half a dozen times and laughing at the name, I saw it recommended in Fodor's, and quickly Yelped it to see that  it was indeed a highly appreciated, just two dollar signs, seafood spot.  Couldn't wait to go, and it was dee-licious!    I had a pound of snow crab legs in their hot and juicy sauce.  Normally I would get the crawfish, but they are out of season right now, so they just had frozen available.  Thankfully our server had given us a heads up that their spicy was a notch or two above most other places; I had \"mild\" and my lips were burning with the first bite.  Not that I let a little thing like that slow me down.  You have to order corn and red bliss potatoes by the piece, so I had one of each, and they had also absorbed the awesome hot spicy flavor from the sauce.  The weak link in this restaurant are the servers.  Supposedly every server is yours, not just one.  But we found that meant asking several people for the same item before we actually got it.  Happened twice to us with requests for more ketchup and more water, and we heard the table next to us say the same thing.  Also, our original server placed our order incorrectly (which she acknowledged immediately) so then one member of our party had to wait 10+ minutes for her food to come out while the rest of us were eating.  And since we didn't have our \"own\" waitress, nobody gave us updates, nobody let a manager know, and we kept having to flag servers down to find out what was happening.  It definitely turned a five star rating into a four star rating.",

Lemon pepper and garlic butter is also yum. Always with a bowl of rice or two. Fried stuff is great too as well as the sausages. I've tried the crab and it's real good but too much work for tiny pieces so I usually pass on that. Totally recommend this spot. I came to this place when it first opened and it's crazy to see how it's grown into expanding to so many locations. A must stop! Yum!",

We were greeted by a nice San Diegan transplant and he told us about the popular things on the menu and what to order. My sister and I got 2 alcohol beverages which tasted like juice. Our waitress was very nice and sweet and the best thing was the fries and our waiter who brought our drinks out. The catfish was very and the fries were crispy but had a little too much salt for my taste. Also we told Josh that the drinks did not taste like it had any alcohol, in which he told us he has heard that before.. he apologized and asked the manager if he could take it off our bill and that person said no. So in all we paid for drinks that were horrible with no taste and dry seafood. I would definitely not come back to this establishment.",

    "text": "This is my absolutely must go at least once place when I visit Las Vegas and I go to Las Vegas about once a year (it's not the slots, my relatives live there!) If youridea of dinner out is nice place settings, fine flatware and dinnerware this is NOT the place for you and if you think using your hands as a means to get the food to your mouth is barbaric then definitely DO NOT come here. The best deal is ordering seafood by the pound, choosing your sauce and degree of spiciness and wait for it to be plunked down on your table in plastic bags. I have to confess that crawfish is very popular here but I am not a fan of crawfish but maybe it's because I haven't mastered how to get the most out of it but watching people who love it, it must be very good. I love ordering shrimp with the classic hot n' juicy sauce at medium spiciness, leftover sauce is always taken home and I've even sauteed some shrimp and added it to the leftover sauce to have another feast at home and it tastes great. The soft shell crab is pretty good too and occasionally I've ordered the fresh oysters. The prices are reasonable, about US $13 for a pound of seafood. I've had clams, mussels, shrimp but shrimp to me has the best value as shells of the other stuff weigh a lot more. Bibs are provided as well as lots of paper towel and disposable gloves. Serving dishes are either plastic bags or paper lined plastic baskets or disposable bowls and plates. Tables are covered with plastic and that is your placemat as well and at the end of your meal they just tie up the corners of the tablecloth to bundle up the remnants of your meal and straight into the garbage bins.",

When the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. I really like the responsiveness of the staff.   Now for the food, we had Alaskan King Crab($27/lb) with garlic and butter, Snow Crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, fried shrimp with Cajun fries, and corn fritters. Everything was good. The spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. Burn baby burn! We needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. Don't expect fine dining. The atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, TVs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags.   So, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. But for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. Ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. I can handle straight Thai peppers and fresh Serranos. So believe me when I say they can make it hot.",

    "text": "I wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so I decided to treat her and her fiance to some Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  I grew up in so cal where Boiling Crab reigns supreme, and after moving to Vegas I've had an empty void that needed filling.  I saw the Man vs Food episode and I've read the reviews before stepping in, So I came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.     Between the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen raw oysters, catfish basket, 2# shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy.  The only complaint about the service was that our raw oysters, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.  Raw Oysters- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  I'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  Oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.    Catfish basket- breaded in a cornmeal crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  Personally I'm not a big fan of cornmeal breading, but I can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  Catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"Southern\" flavor.  I actually enjoyed this the most.    Shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy-  We ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"hot n juicy special\" sauce isn't as flavorful as I expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at Boiling Crab.  But the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  Not the freshest shrimp I've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert?   Crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy-  I'm debating whether or not I should even review this item just because I should have known better than to order this when I already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  Needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  So I'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  Perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.    Maybe I'm being a bit unfair because I'm comparing this establishment to Boiling Crab.  However the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  If I was asked to come here again, I would, but I don't see myself CRAVING Hot and Juicy Crawfish like I do for Boiling Crab.  I guess my best advice is if you're a Boiling Crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.",

The food was great, the servers were friendly, but when it came time to pay our bill, the manager refused to let our server split our bill into individual checks.  I have never seen a restaurant that refused to let a group split their bill.  Negotiating with the manager on the issue was like talking to a brick wall. There was no reasoning with her, just an explanation of a blanket policy that only so many cards were allowed per table.  It made me think they had some issue with paying credit card fees, and when we offered to pay the transaction percentage, the same blanket refusal to split the checks came back up.  After other members of our group tried to reason with her, she agreed to split the checks, but took so dramatically long to process each card that out of frustration one person in our group gave up and agreed to pay the whole amount.  That wasn't fair to him, and it was a bad way to do business.  I am going to write this off to an inexperienced manager who was trying to stand her ground behind a bad company policy she didn't fully understand, but regardless, it made for an unnecessary and unpleasant situation.  If you eat at this place, make sure everyone sits at their own table or be prepared to foot the bill.",

Of course our first thought was whole shabang?!? In Vegas?!? What could be better. Sadly to say it is not.   We beat the rush so we were seated right away. I was curious about lousiana style which now I'm thinkin is plain....? My friend got the hot & juicy special. For both of us it was lacking, we like our food drenched with flavorful sauce. If ur a dry food kinda person you'll probably like it. I thought the shrimps were good... had leftover seafood taste tho. We actually liked our corn it was pretty sweet. I order a side of extra sauce which could have saved the whole situation except it had this weird plastic taste in it.  The service was good. They were attentive.    Overall. It was ok. Quality of the shrimp & corn *thumbs up* The sauce *thumbs down*",

The only real downfalls I find with this spot are the average wait time of 30 mins and that you leave with your hands smelling fishy (but whats to expect after you have to peel your way through pounds of shrimp, crawfish, crab and the all!)  I'm craving this spot right now! Lol",

    "text": "This is definitely off the beaten path if you are one of those types of people that live for The Strip and all of its foo-foo overpriced eateries. Located about two miles from the strip, give or take a few feet, Hot N Juicy is located in Vegas' \"Chinatown\", although I saw more Vietnamese and Korean joints than I did Chinese.   First of all......if you are waiting outside the front door, BEWARE THE RAMP LOCATED BY THE DISABLED PARKING SPOT! Its made out of the same asphalt that the rest of the parking lot is made out of, and the wife didn't see it, and she ate shit............Please be careful.   With that being said, we went this past Sunday, (05/29/11), and it was jam packed. Right away, they let us know that they just opened up another location down the street, but we politely declined and toughed out the wait. For our party of 10, which we said didn't mind having split up if it got us in faster, the wait time was only about 30-40 minutes, and they told us it would be about as much.   When we were seated, the waitress was kind enough to explain the flavors and levels of spiciness and she was right on. Getting right into it, we tried the shrimp (lemon pepper and garlic butter, both mild), the fried catfish basket with fries, the corn on the cob, and the steamed rice.   SHRIMP-   Big, fat, juicy, and oh so tasty. Unlike other places similar to this one, the sauces they used for both types we tried were kind of thin in terms of thickness (?), but VERY, VERY, VERY FLAVORFUL. We've been to places that the sauce is almost sandy or chalky, but here, it is like a nice shrimp stock, and we easily and most enjoyably poured it all over our steamed rice, which made it that much better!   CATFISH-   The catfish basket comes with fries. Fries, who can F those up? Not these guys! Crisp, crunchy, and salty. Perfect the way a fry should be. The catfish, perfectly cooked, comes in a nice cornmeal type of coating that adds a little extra crunch. Only problem is, they only give you about a fillet and a half, if that. I've been to places where they give you almost 3 fillets and that would have to be my only bitch about the fish.   SIDES-   Corn on the cob was awesome. Boiled, Buttery, sweet, and not overcooked. Simplicity at its finest.   Steamed Rice- ditto. Simple, yet delicious.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE-   The wait was expected. It was out the door just like other people said. Waitresses were very helpful, but with the exception of the first refill, were slow on the next couple. As far as ordering more food, they were spot on. I'd come back over here for sure, and I'd bring my friends too. If you don't mind a wait, or taking the roads less traveled, be brave and head this way!",

    "text": "A review of this place by me is extremely overdue.  Honestly, I feared sharing this little desert jewel with everyone and they mama...but I guess when something's that good, word spreads like an LA wildfire.  Background: I'm from CA.  I've never been to Lousiana but I have been to Crawdaddy's (SJ, CA), Boiling Crab (SJ, CA) and Hot n Juicy.  My first experience eating cajun seafood was at Hot n Juicy about 4 years ago.  Ever since then, I became an instant fan.  I've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence Crawdaddy's and Boiling Crab.  Anyhow, by far, Hot n Juicy blows the other two out the water, HANDS DOWN!!  I just went to Hot n Juicy over the July 15th weekend and the ish was BOMB DIGGITY!!!  Their crawfish was huge.  Usually I think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. But so worth it, I mean they were so big, I even ate the critters' claws...OMG! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?  ** As some of you may be aware, I'm allergic to shell fish but DAMN, I make sure to bring my benadryl so I can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.  That's how good Hot n Juicy is.    BTW, if you didn't know:  They have now added King Crab legs...man, I might die from OD'ing on shellfish that I know I really shouldn't be indulging in...GLUTTONY  For those of you looking to compare:  It has been a toss up between Boiling Crab in SJ, CA and Hot n Juicy.  After I got back from Las Vegas, I went to Boiling Crab to make sure I ate at both places within a short time span so as to keep flavors and experience fresh in my mind....well (drum roll please.....HOT n JUICY TAKES THE CAKE).  Hot n Juicy has at a minimum 2 more secret ingredients that BC doesn't have.  The intense spicy flavors are there at HnJ (Hot n Juicy special) without the thick oilyness that BC has in their Whole Shabang.",

I had to say I was extremely sketchy because you get a pound or more of crawfish freshly boiled, mixed in with their seasonings and sauces, and you have to be the one to crack them open yourself to get to the crawfish meat, but that is the whole experience and beauty of the restaurant.   I wish I could try their other sauces and seasoning, but I feel even the next step up from what is considered mild is way too spicy and hot for me. Guess I need to work on becoming a novice here! Anyways, this location is always busy, and expect a bit of a wait every time you come (larger parties are always going to be an hour of more). I rate this 4 stars because this is a very interesting experience when it comes to dining! Be fearless!",

    "text": "After the Man vs. Food special at Hot N Juicy how can one not visit this place while in Vegas. Its location is in Chinatown if you are visiting and staying on the strip, but the cab ride is well worth the money to try these succulent crawfish.  Wait time to be seated was expected for a restaurant seen on Man vs. Food, so don't be surprised. The hostess may even tell you to try their other restaurant down the street with \"no wait time,\" but we of course wanted the real deal. When we were finally seated, service wasn't bad at all for a busy Tuesday night, food came out consistently as we ordered. Which brings me to...THE FOOD!  I suggest tightening that bib across your neck because once that food comes out, get ready to lick those juices around your fingers slowly running down the side of your hands because it's going to get a bit messy!  Sweet potato fries: The perfect balance between sweet and salty. Fries came in a basket and had the right amount of juicy flavor, not dry but not drenched in oil either. A great way to start the beginning of the feast.  3 lbs of Hot N Juicy Special Crawfish and 1 lb of Shrimp: Better than expected! Crawfish come steamed in a bag drenched in their special sauce. Full of flavor and deliciousness! The heads don't come with too much juice, but crawfish meat come exceptionally hefty, as do the shrimp. I actually prefer their seafood drenched in so much flavor than the fire burning crawfish we had at New Orleans! Spice isn't too overwhelming... I think we got the medium. Get the potato and corn as they are steamed in with the crawfish too!   Well worth the trip and money! We had a great time getting down and dirty with these crawfish and shrimp. I don't think I'll ever find the perfect blend of spice and flavor! This place is a definite must when visiting Vegas!!",

The crab was amazing but not having gloves made my experience less than satisfying, especially because I still somehow got stains under my nails and I literally just got them done not even a week ago. For $60 worth of crab I feel like at least 1 pair of gloves should have been placed in the bag, a napkin at the least . If I would have picked it up myself I would have made sure I had that before walking out, but unfortunately, someone else picked it up for me and didn't think to check the bag before they left. For future reference, please include gloves in takeout orders and if you are ordering takeout, make sure you have gloves in your bag before leaving the establishment. I don't have this problem when I order from the location off the strip.",

As usual, food was great. We had the Get Your Feet Wet plus a side of Sweet Potato and Cajun fries. It was great until I chew on one of the crawfish and it tasted like sand and dirty water. Since I was so hungry I didn't mind at first. A few more things left in our food, I and my husband started having a tummy ache. We thought that we were just over eating honestly. When we got home, he started having diarrhea and I was throwing up. We gave it a couple minutes to see if we just really over ate but the following day, I threw up again and I also had the diarrhea. I and my husband were both very nauseous for 3 straight days.  We're giving you 2 stars for great service while we were dining. But not giving you that 3 as you need to focus more on making sure that you clean the food thoroughly before you actually cook it so no other customers get food poisoned like us. Will not eat here anymore. :(",

I ordered 2# of frozen crawfish @ $8.99/# but was told \"they were out of frozen crawfish, would I like to substitute fresh ones for $15.00/#.\" I was ok with this. My gf's food came out 15 minutes before mine did. When mine arrived it was only 1# instead of 2#. I ate two of them and they were the softest crawfish I've ever had. I've eaten crawfish many, many times and I've never add crawfish tails that couldn't be pulled from the tail in one piece. I'm not sure if they were old or over cooked, but they were terrible. I told the waiter and he asked if I wanted more of the same. My answer was \"no, I'm not paying for this crap and I don't want more. I'm disappointed that I had this terrible experience, but I won't ever return.",

In CA they have a place like this and i was so afraid i wouldn't find  a place like that here in vegas but i was wrong.   We order a pound of shrimp with all sauces mix , corn and a side of rice  It was so delicious and flavorful then with the sauce left we mixed it with our rice   Yes you will end up smelling like garlic and your hands too but for some one who loves garlic that is just a heavenly smell i am lucky my fiance loves garlic too lol  I really recommend this place and i cant wait until i come back - we came here around 1pm and it wasn't crowd it at all.   They do have a thing on yelp where it says you call and dine on us -it isnt really specific but call and give it a try !   Dont come here wearing white because you will sure end up with some stains or just use your bib",

For those a bit on the 'daintier'side, they have plastic gloves for those with fresh manicures.  After having lightly feasting prior to this, my stomach found its second wind.  Upon entering, you're hit with the aroma of spices and seafood wafting from the dining room.  Make sure you get there with plenty of time to avoid waiting.  Greeted with a smile, we were seated quickly and handed menus.  After ordering some beers we quickly ordered.  Crabs, shrimp, crawfish, dungeness crab, mussels, corn, potatoes, rice.  I don't remember much during the meal as I was entranced with devouring all of the delicious goodie bags that decorated our table.  With the pile of napkins growing by the minute, we sat back and surveyed the land.  A truly fierce battle with everyone the winner.  *if you order dungeness crab, the trick is to pour rice into the shell to soak all of the crab fat for a decadent treat.",

After trying out boiling crab in LA at two locations (the original in Alhambra and then koreatown thereafter), I sorta \"gave up\" on it. I thought I was crazy, since I seemed to be the exception to the rule...EVERYONE LOVES THIS STUFF.   Well, I wanted to give it another stab. I really didn't like the flavors too much at boiling crab, and thanks HOT N JUICY, I have renewed hope!!!  I loved the MILD sauce flavor A LOT, and it tasted VERY different from boiling crab or some other places I've tried.   The corn with the mild sauce was SEW GOOD. The shrimp was my fave!  I love snow crab, but, it's hard since you can't get much of the sauce in the crab meat, and I just love snow crab on it's own. Plus, my hands are too lazy for all that workout.   I've NOT been able to stop thinking about this place since. GONNA BE BACK THERE SOON.",

For those of you coming from California as I am, this is basically the Boiling Crab of Vegas (just so you know what to expect).  When I entered, I was immediately and enthusiastically greeted by the staff, even though the restaurant was extremely packed. They sat us down quickly and took our order promptly.  I was starving, so I ordered two pounds of the Shrimp on the Hot n Juicy sauce. I got it spicy, but for those of you who cannot handle spice well, I suggest getting a medium or lower.   The food was absolutely fantastic. the shrimp were all perfectly cooked and coated with the delicious sauce. BE WARNED: this is extremely messy. They give you gloves and a bib and I highly suggest you take it. Don't come wearing anything too fancy because I guarantee the sauce will get somewhere.   Overall, I would highly recommend anyone wants some delicious seafood at a reasonable price to come to this location and enjoy the hell out of yourself. It's fun, it's delicious, and it's an experience. What more can you ask for?",

    "text": "Heard this is the best crawfish joint in chinatown so, naturally we had to come here to give it a try and what's weird is that they have two locations really close by each other and we just didn't know which one would taste better so we decided to go to this location. Be prepared to come out smelling like what you just ate as our uber driver noticed it but he said he loved the smell lol wonder what everyone else though as we walked the stripped after our meal.  I ordered the 1lb blue crab, 1 lb crawfish and dozen oyster shooters hot n juicy style in mild. The prices here are crazy cheaper than places like rockin' crawfish and hang ten boiler here in the bay area and surprisingly tasted way better (funny how we got better crawfish in the dessert than back at home). The flavor of the sauce was amazing with chunks of minced garlic and the amazing flavor of cajun spices with a hint of sweetness and i just wish they gave you more sauce to go with your food.  The Blue crab was crazy cheap and we lucked out with 3 female crabs with eggs (YUM!) a little under cooked but cooked enough as the meat was a little mushy. If you order the blue crab be prepared to really get your hands dirty as they give you the whole crab and you have to pry the head off (which i don't mind and every time i eat at crawfish spots i don't use gloves so my fingers end up smelling for a week or so haha). The crawfish was perfectly boiled and the tail came out perfectly and was the highlight of my meal. The Oyster was a bit disappointing as they were really large in size and it had no flavor on the oyster or the juices. It tasted like they pried the oysters open then rinsed it in water.  The staff was just amazing and really efficient in their roles. Our server was attentive and checked on us regularly. She made sure to keep us in the know about our meal (she said our order will come as they cook and that the crab will come last as it take a while to cook), when our drinks were running low she would swoop in to refill our beverage.   Highly recommended spot if you're in Vegas",

    "text": "OMG BEST CRAWFISH OF MY LIFE!  THEY REALLY ARE HELLA HOT AND JUICY!!  *mouth waters*  Seriously though, this place is  BOMB!  A must try for anybody that enjoys seafood and is hanging out in Vegas.  The restaurant is located near LV Chinatown, off the strip on Spring Mountain Road.  It gets really busy in the evening, so I would recommend making reservations before hand.  My group of eight had to wait 45 minutes for a table (but since we were all pretty buzzed it went by extremely fast, lol).  The decor inside is very nice; definitely makes you hungry and impatient for the seafood.  The smell of hot, juicy crawfish is mixed in the air... I could not wait much longer to sink my mouth into them!  We ordered three pounds of crawfish (each pound including a potato), calamari, and Cajun fries.  The crawfish wasn't too expensive (under $15 a pound), and when they arrived in bags, we were ready to chow down.  I took my first bite of spicy crawfish, and BAM!!  Juices flowed into my mouth, and I was in crawfish heaven!  Everything was delicious!!  The crawfish pieces were decent (I mean, they don't have a lot of meat on them anyway), but once you start crunching on its shell, the juices come right out and that itself is so tasty.  I definitely plan on coming back here in the future.  Valet parking is not available and is limited, but there is a grocery center across the street where you can park and walk over.",

We usually order:  -Crab legs (spicy medium) -Shrimp (spicy medium) -Add sausage and corn -Seasoned fries -Bud Light  I generally don't drink beer (the occasional Amstel Light when boating) but for whatever reason when eating at Hot N Juicy I just have to have a Bud Light to wash down all the flavorful, salty goodness.  Three tips:  1. YES wear the plastic gloves, if they don't give them to you, ask for them. Otherwise you will wreck your manicure with all the juice and sauce.  2. Bring a hair clip (if you have long hair)  3. Wear clothes that you don't mind absorbing garlic and HNJ sauce aromas. You will smell like a HNJ shellfish when you leave this restaurant.  Mmm just writing about this makes me crave HNJ now!",

It'll require some work, but once you get down to the juicy pieces of meat, you'll feel so accomplished.   We also had the shrimp and they were some huge pieces of shrimp.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped by this place last week, mainly because we saw the restaurant featured on Man vs. Food and because of the great reviews it gets on Yelp. Sadly, I was let down by Adam Richman and all of my fellow Yelpers.  Shortly after we were seated, the waitress warned us that Hot N Juicy's spice levels were much higher than your \"typical restaurant\" and advised us to go for a lower spicy level when we ordered our shrimp. Taking her advice, we went with a milder sauce. We noticed a lot of things wrong when we got our shrimp:  - There was absolutely no \"juice\" in the bag. We have been to similar restaurants where the shrimp/crawdads are served in the \"juice\" to give added flavor. Considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting JUICY.  - The shrimp had absolutely no flavor to them. It literally tasted like they boiled a bag of shrimp in water and served it to us. Again, considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting HOT.  We asked for a hotter sauce on the side to dip our shrimp in since we were let down by the sauce we ordered. The waitress was kind enough to come back with a small container of their \"Hot N Juicy\" sauce. This was also very subpar - it tasted like a blend of marinara sauce with a hint of Tabasco. Again, the sauce was not spicy at all. I think its important to note that my girlfriend and I aren't huge fans of spicy food. When we do order wings or shrimp, we tend to go for a medium level of spiciness due to our own sensitivities with spicy food. That being said, nothing in this restaurant (that we tried) is even remotely spicy.  We also ordered a side of calamari. These were ok, but considering the price for the order it was not worth it.   The only saving grace for this restaurant is the ambiance and decor. The restaurant itself has a cool modern look, is very well air conditioned (which is a big thing for me) and plays good music. I would come here to buy a beer but would stay the hell away from the food.",

    "text": "OK, I'm not a Las Vegas local (even though my 2 brothers-in-law are).  So I found about Hot N Juicy from TV, specifically Travel Channel's Man Vs Food.  Knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, I came here for lunch on Friday of my last Vegas visit.  We met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  Even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!    Once the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  As this is an Asian-owned establishment, I recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  Here's what I ordered for our party of 3:  1 pound of shrimp, with Garlic Butter, mild spice 1 pound of crawfish, Louisana Style, medium spice 1 order of Calamari 1 order of Sweet Potato Fries  The fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  But when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  The shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  And while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  Just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!  Just like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  They have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!  Overall, this was one of our favorite meals in Las Vegas.  It's in Chinatown and pretty far away from the Strip, so rent a car to get here.",

    "text": "Went here for a late lunch after finding a four star, casual, place on Yelp with over 500 reviews and two $$ rating,  my kind of place...  I can't help but compare it to the Boiling Crab in LA since everything about it is virtually the same, even the sweet potato fries, and the half corn on the cob in the bag.  But for those of you who aren't familiar with the Boiling Crab chain, it a crab boil in a pouch too with only one minor difference that mattered to me:  here they offer etouffee instead of gumbo, and I think I prefer Boiling Crab's gumbo over HNJC's etouffee...  The other difference between the two is that there isn't this insane wait to get in like the Boiling Crab always seems to have, which is great for HNJC.  The four of us ordered:  Sweet Potato Fries ($4.25):  these were long and slender deep fried sweet potatoes and came with ketchup on the side.   Ok, but I don't like sweet potatoes that much... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=9ouHMxvk3Ajz4FZsTNLJxQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1...</a>  Chicken Wings Basket (5 pieces)  ($7.95):  these wings served on a bed of regular fries and come with ranch dressing and ketchup.  The wings were nice and lightly fried, very moist and juicy.  Good... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=IooJdoITYr8QFM_qBcVMSQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1...</a>  2 Etouffee plus 1 bowl of rice ($6.99 x2 plus $2):  the etouffee had a consistency like coarse oatmeal, had a little heat in it, and already had some rice in it.  Even with the rice already in it, it needed the additional rice to tame the spice which was more like a peppery heat than anything else.  I like gumbo more than etouffee, but even then, I had a really kick ass etouffee at a NY street food fair recently... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=k8YQoV8gLp64rbPXyY5rsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1...</a>  1 lb Crawfish ($9.99 lb):  had the Hot n Juicy Special seasoning without any additional spice level.  The flavor was definitely there, not too spicy which is the way I like it,  it's just that eating crawfish is too much work.  I usually choose shrimp because it's the best deal, the shell is light and easy to peel, so there is more meat to shell ratio.  We had two corn on the cobs in the bag and they were tasty as usual because they absorbed all of the flavor in the bag... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=Aa8X2cG2oAMY5kLgLzonxA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1...</a>  1 lb Shrimp w/Lemon Pepper ($10.99 lb): 1 lb Shrimp w/Garlic Butter ($10.99 lb);  I treat both of these the same since the spice level on both was mild.  Like I said above, I think shrimp is the best deal because you don't pay too much for the shell and you get a lot of meat... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=_Ja-CD62sFXd2EPpiEnU8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1...</a>  The service was great, the girls who waited on us were attentive but not hovering...  I would probably come back, but since I don't live close by that presents a problem...",

I'm so glad that we did.  Though the crawfish was very good, there was so little meat.  Enter the shrimp, here you get an entire mouthful of sweet flesh for the same effort.  I really liked the special sauce or whatever, but did wish that it saturated the crustaceans better.  We also ordered the etoufee...not a tomato based etoufee, but very good.  It's completely mixed in with the rice so it was almost like a gumbo.  The sweet potato fry were crispy.    All in all, we are very happy with the food.  The next time, we will order more shrimp...so delish.  O, and instead of mild, we'll go all the way.",

The setting is plain. Be forewarned, your food is delivered in a plastic bag and there is a roll of paper towels on every table (you're gonna need it!)!  We each ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in garlic butter with mild spice. I am embarrassed/proud that I had no problem eating the 2 lbs of shrimp plus corn and a potato.  Again, another heads up, the shrimp have shells, including heads, intact so it is peel and eat. The shrimp were firm, meaty and had the proper texture for cooked shrimp. The garlic butter was just right, also, with good sized chunks of fresh garlic. I will definitely return to this no frills but tasty restaurant!",

We had our bibs tied tight, gloves on comfortably and big empty stomach ready. Game on!  In order to make a proper assessment on this fine establishment, I ordered what I typically order at Boiling Crab. 1 lb. of shrimp w/ garlic butter medium and a basket of catfish.   1 lb. shrimp -- Pretty good-sized shrimp, comparable to Boiling Crab. However, the seasoning is a lot better at Boiling Crab. Not only was there a thick layer of oil but the flavor seemed to be missing something. Even when we re-dipped our peeled shrimp, it still tasted bland.  Catfish basket -- 4 pieces of thickly cut catfish fillets. Thick, juicy with a nice layer of breading. It was appetizing but still fell short. I'd prefer to get them from Boiling Crab. However, their cajun fries were a huge surprise. I think they were spicier than our shrimp seasoning.   Service was great. Everyone was on their A-game. A few different waiters/waitresses came by to check up on us. The place is just alright but I'd rather save my spicy-seafood-served-on-a-table fix for Boiling Crab.",

As we were patiently waiting we get our food and as excited we were we started eating, at this point I didn't get my rice or the sausage in the bag, we flagged Michelle and advised her of the missing items, she then comes back and brings the rice.    Finally we are almost done and yet still no sausages were brought nor do we get her to come by for refills on our drinks or to let us know what's taking so long, we become frustrated and my husband gets up and goes to the servers and tells them to forget about it, we then have Michelle come by with our bill and says I took it off the bill.   At this point we didn't say anything to her as we were annoyed.  I wasn't expecting a free meal but a decent I sincerely apologize for the delay but I guess that's too much to ask. I give this place a 2 stars for poor service. Food was great.   If you want good food come by, but in my opinion not worth my money, service honestly makes the experience all that better.

The server, Danny, was amazing. He allowed us to sample the crawfish etouffe which was delicious. We also ordered the corn fritters. Yum!! The fries brownies knocked my socks off. I was so tempted to get another order but I resisted. The food was great, the place was clean and the servers were awesome",

    "text": "We went here hoping to get some amazing seafood but the experience was terrible from start to finish. There was a 35 minute wait on a Monday night and only after we were seated and started to order did the waitress inform us that they didn't have over half the menu in stock. That meant no lobster or king crab at all. We ended up ordering some mussels and blue crab and asked for garlic butter and hot & juicy sauce on the side.  The sauces tasted identical to each other and neither was any good. The mussels were way overcooked and flavorless and the crab came pre-seasoned with a pepper mix that did not go well with the sauce at all. On top of that, they told us that they were \"running low\" on the crab crackers and couldn't give us one. I literally had to smash the crab open using the edge of the table. What's worse is that the bags they gave us clearly contained less food than advertised.   I asked the waitress if she could do anything to help us out with the bill. She flat out said no and didn't care that we had a terrible night here. I get the feeling that this place knows their primary customers are tourists that will never be repeat customers anyways, so why care about making anyone happy as long as people keeping coming?  Well, your restaurant was so bad I decided to post my first Yelp review in years just to make sure no one else has their dinner ruined. Luckily, one of your competitors was still open and we went there after our first round of seafood and had a much better experience.",

My friend and I shared an order of fried calamari and of chicken wings (with their Cajun fries!) as an appetizer and both were delicious! The fried calamari is by far the best I have ever had and just going back for that would be completely worth it. The meal didn't stop there though!   I ordered a pound of shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning and it was out of this world good. I love shrimp and here they were big and juicy and perfectly seasoned! I also got to try some of my friend's crawfish (also with the hot n juicy seasoning) and that was marvelous.   I liked this place because the food was delicious, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean. I am absolutely coming back here during my next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "My husband and I love a good creole broil, so when I saw this featured on Man vs Food I knew I had to come try this place out. I didn't realize that there were several stores in Vegas and even some in So. Cal. We got in just before the dinner rush so we waited about 5 minutes, but it even when we walked out it didn't seem like the wait time was too bad.   We has tried their Hot N Juicy seasoning (which was garlic butter, lemon pepper, cajun, and Louisana all together) and baby spice hotness level in shrimp and mussels because I don't like it too spicy, the baby spice was still a little spicier than I'd like but provided good flavor. With our broil we added corn, sausage, and red potatoes.  The flavors were very bold and strong. We ordered a side of sweet potato fries. To cap off the dinner, I had to try the fried brownies.  When it arrived it was warm and aromatic. The outside was a soft shell that wasn't too hard but provided great texture to the soft moist inside. We weren't able to finish it so we took it to go and after two days when we got home from our trip, we placed it in our air fryer to warm it up and it still tasted like it just came out of the restaurant kitchen. Everything was very tasty especially the fried brownies. We'll definitely be back and will be looking to try the locations closer to home.  Parking can be a bit tricky because it's a small lot for the amount of restaurants for this location, so parking can become very limited in front of the establishment.",

Fair warning, this place is so good that on days like that it will be packed and with a bit of a wait.

They great you at the door and have you seated promptly, and even if it's not your waitress/waiter they all  help each other out by checking on all the tables not just the one they are assigned. The new place 3863, they kind of make you feel like you are burdening them. They also avoid eye contact when passing your table so you have to work double hard in flagging them down. The seasoning sometimes is watered down and not even hot. I feel like the one on 4810 is always on point. Hot, flavorful, and again prompt. The one at 3863 is definitely bigger/newer with all the TVs and music and nice bathroom, but I'll trade all that for the service you get at 4810. Oh, and did I mention I am from Louisiana. I've lived here now for 2yrs because of work, and enjoy a nice outing that reminds me a little of home. So, thank you Hot N Juicy on 4810. Y'all really give me that experience each time I visit.",

    "text": "Being from Southern California where the king of crawfish restaurant resides, The Boiling Crab, it's hard to find another place that can dethrone it. But my wife and I had to give Hot and Juicy Crawfish a try after seeing it on one of our favorite shows, Man vs Food.  The food looked absolutely delicious on the show, everything that my wife and I come to expect from this type of restaurant.  We had a basketball tournament in Vegas this past weekend and made sure we made time to head over to Hot and Juicy.  Made it there on Friday afternoon around 1:30pm. I was happy to see that it wasn't so busy and were able to get seated right away. At Boiling Crab, the average wait time is an hour.  We ordered the following: one pound of crawfish, two pounds of shrimp and five corns all in the special Hot and Juicy sauce medium spicy.  The sauce itself was not bad. It's doable but it does not compare to Boiling Crab's shabang sauce.  The shabang sauce is love at first bite.   The crawfish was not bad but the shrimp and corn were not very good. The body of the shrimp was fine but the shrimp heads was dry. No juice/brains to enjoy sucking on and the corn was very rubbery, sort of like eating candy corn.  My wife and I shared one corn and left 4 uneaten. Normally, we could eat three each.  For those who have not tried Boiling Crab, you might find Hot and Juicy Crawfish a good place to eat.  But for those who have dined at Boiling Crab, you will be disappointed.    I will be sending Adam Richman (host of Man vs Food) an email of my review and a recommendation that if he is ever in Orange County California, to stop by Boiling Crab and see what he thinks.",

It smells kind of gross if you aren't used to this sort of thing. The service was very good. Our waitress was helpful as we were on our maiden voyage. The service is the best part of the entire experience.  If you are with others and never had crawfish I would highly recommend to first order one pound then order more if you like them. It is an acquired taste and to tell you the truth I didn't like them. Especially sucking the juice from the head. Blah! I only tried the Special Sauce Mild and found it to actually be very good. I also had shrimp and it was more satisfying after all the work of peeling. Bigger reward at the end not like the tiny reward from crawfish. I was disappointed only because it looked so much better on TV. Would I go back? I highly doubt it as I couldn't get the smell out of my nose and breath for a coupe days. Wearing gloves makes it so hard to peel but saves on the stinkies. Maybe I needed to wash it down with a cold beer but in any case it only gets a 3Star because a 2Star wouldnt be reflective of the awesome service we had from our waitress. Waitress 5Star food was 2star.  UPDATE: As funny as it might seem, I am wanting to go again, but staying away from the Crawfish. Have upped my rating because of the craving.",

The seasonings of the hot and juicy flavor is great.... the crab and shrimp cooked in this seasoning is sooooo DELICIOUS, corn and potatoes are so yummy.  If you order the shrimp you get soooo much for the price $10.   I love the idea of all the plastic bags, gloves, tableclothes....no utensils, no plates...its so fun!!!   Oh and the spicy is definitely spicy!!!   Its a couple miles off the strip but even being a tourist having to take a cab, its well worth the extra $10 cab ride.",

Everyone was right on the money in that mild isn't the normal mild.  For those that can't take heat at all, there is a level under mild with no spicyiness they informed us.  It was packed on the Sat evening so we got a pound of blue crab and pound of crawfish to go and boy did we ever stink up the hotel room.  The blue crabs were good and fresh and I think they don't always have them available.  Crawfish were good and it was nice sucking out the head sauce.  Definitely a place to go if you want to be casual and be a pig.  Next time we will wait and sit in the restaurant for the full experience.",

Danielle our server which her name tag mentioned she was a lead server which I can not believe she gave us the worst service. First off she sat us with no menus I had to get up and get them from the next table, second we waited 5-10mins after getting our food for a servers attention to tell them our order was incorrect and all Danielle did was nod and rolled her eyes so we assumed our new order was going to come out yet it never did and yet we ended up being charged for it. Their was 2 servers on the floor Danielle and Reme no server ever came by to check on us but yet they went to every other table. We work in the restaurant industry and I would never treat a paying guest this way. Next time a friend of mine mentions on dining at Hot & Juicy I will let them know that their hard earned money should be spent somewhere else!!",

Three words in, she was already asking me to repeat myself.  Screw it.  You didn't want to speak to me while I was there and you are incapable of hearing over the roar when I call on the phone.

This place is located in a small strip mall like many others in the Asian part of town, keep driving past the Pho shops and the Chinese restaurants and you are here.  This is not your \"traditional\" crawfish, it keeps a lot of the traditional flavors but throws in some Southeast Asian flair.  I got the two pounder of crawfish, got couple of beers,  rolled up my sleeves literally but the bip and went to town on those bad boys.  I go the Hot and Spicy and it was the right about of heat in it for me, if you know what the jucieness from the head of the crawfish tastes like than you know what I am talking about, tons of shrimp like flavor juices with the spices, and since this reciepe has tons of butter it creates a layer that stays on the shell which ups the calories, cholesterol, and saturated fat but takes the flavor up too.  The corn was a bit overdone though, the potato was good but only two little pieces.  This gets me a bit because corn and potato are cheap but tasty bits and yet they skimp on it.  Everything was good besides the corn and potato.  They should have a sign that tells you what the market price is before you order because $12.99/lb??",

    "text": "Hot and Mushy is more like it!  This place is WAY over priced, and they do NOT stand behind their food.  We live in a neighborhood of friends, and often get together on a Friday night and order something fun.  Many times it has been Hot and Juicy.  This week we ordered hot and juicy for pickup.  We ordered 13 lbs... 11 lbs of shrimp, and 2 lbs. of crawfish.  The shrimp were inedibly mushy when we got them home.  Luckily, I had defrosted a bunch of king crab legs an lobster tails from Costco.  This higher quality seafood saved the day, and the party.  We called hot and juicy the next day to see if they would refund the money for the shrimp, and that we would gladly bring back the mushy shrimp.  It took 4-5 calls and many hilarious conversations dealing with several of the 20-something children who seem to run the place. One girl said \"for the future, I would ask them to put no more than a lb. per bag.  The shrimp are fickle\"  Really, young child??  As if we are the ones who packed all of the shrimp in one bag!  I'm not at all convinced the amount per bad has any bearing, but she shed all responsibility, saying she doesn't have the authority to give a refund. After a few more calls with other little girls who had no authority, we finally got a hold of a manager, since the owner is apparently too important to deal with his customers.  He offered a 5% discount on our next order.  when we promised to write the story on Yelp, he upped it to 10%.  The problem is, I don't want disgusting mushy shrimp paste nastiness at any price.  The manager said \"I checked with the 'chef' (I'd call him a cook at best) and he said that they were cooked perfectly\".  Did he?  Hahaha!  Of course he said that. I have 10 people, one a sous chef at a restaurant in the Bellagio, who beg to differ.  The manager also practically accused us of lying when we told him we order from there often saying \"well, I don't see an order history on your card\". This, after we had already mentioned that a different person in our group of 10 picks up the food each time. Some of us pay cash.  This place is damned sure not worth the wait, and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.  They just lost a ton of business from all of us and everyone we know, and don't seem to care at all.  They simply don't stand behind their product at all, so why should we?  Order at your own risk!",

This place isn't too far from the strip when you take a cab, just make sure you get the cab's phone number so you can call them when you're done. I would not recommend walking here. When we first walked in, I kind of got a bad vibe from the guy who greeted us first. Actually it wasn't a greeting, he just said to where ever. It wasn't what he said, because they say that to everyone, but it was how he said it,. So I was like oh no, will I enjoy what we are about to eat. The waitress that took our order was friendly and smiled a lot, so I felt a little better. We ordered the Hot n' Spicy,extra spicy, which is basically all the sauces combined and the Garlic Butter, medium, for our crawfish. It was actually pretty tasty. The flavor was good and not overpowering. The group that ate the spicy didn't think it was spicy enough and the group that ate the medium thought that it was a little too spicy. Go figure. At first we thought they switched our order, but we ordered some more extra spicy and they still thought that it was not spicy enough. We order the Garlic butter medium crab and the crab was cooked well, not overcooked at all. We also ordered Cajun fires, which were ok. Nothing to brag about. I would for sure come back to this place when come back to Vegas.",

I like this place as a nice change of pace in Las Vegas, it's different and when the food is dumped right in front of you, you have to bypass your usual table manners and just ripping into the food with your hands hoping you don't get juice in someone's eye from all the cracking. I never knew a roll of paper towels could vanish that fast. I didn't get to try much just the crawfish and the crab, marinated with lemon pepper and garlic butter respectively. The crab was good, what's not to like about snow crab legs? I just wish crab itself was cheaper because I'm hungry and 20 legs deep just makes me want more. The crawfish on the other hand, I can do without. Love the juices, but after about 30 crawfish I felt like all I had was a bowl of soup. Good place, medium layout, decently clean bathrooms (B-) and the more people the better.",

This place was featured on Man V. Food and that has probably contributed to its popularity and thus is packed pretty much all the time, combined with limited seating and almost no parking makes for a rough start to the meal.  However, the seafood is great... fittingly named, everything was hot n juicy.  King crab legs were my favorite, they were huge and deliciously seasoned in their own cajun spices.  The crawfish were an interesting experience.  They were tasty, but i'm one of those people who doesn't like to work for his food that hard.  Whole shrimp were also great, everything, like the crab, came cooked with their cajun spices.  Had some fries on the side and couple of beers, and a messy bib and many napkins later it proved to be a pretty good meal.  All in all a great experience, but unless you're a huge cajun seafood fan there's not a lot of replay value here.  If you're in town and want a fun and interesting meal, check it out.",

Last time i was there i overheard a couple of ignorant patrons complaining, obviously they have no idea what good taste is. Can't fix unsophisticated taste palates.

However, the shrimp and crawfish were just average.  The sauce wasn't that good and super duper spicy even though i ordered the mild.  The service staff there was great but i'm sure others reading this post will agree that they really really try and get you to drink a lot of alcohol.  Every time someone passed us by they kept trying to get us to buy more beer.  I understand they're  just doing their job so i'm not gonna hate on them for that.  The service overall was great.  Very attentive and our server even showed us how to properly de-shell and eat crawfish.  My group had an interesting situation while waiting.  The place was full and their was a sign that read \"please wait to be seated\".  So we stood in line at the door and waited.  There was a host that was taking down names for the waiting list so i tried to get his attention to put my name down but he was very busy cleaning the tables and told me to wait.  So i patiently waited only to see people come in behind me and walk up to him and he wrote their names down.  I figured he was smart and courteous enough to realize that i've been standing their waiting especially since we were blocking the aisle and he had to constantly excuse himself from walking past us.  Of course he sits other's before me and i have to go up to him and ask him about my table.  Expectantly, he tells me i'm next and to just be patient.  I honestly feel that this was an isolated situation on my party and shouldn't reflect their overall great customer service but i thought i should share my experience.  If you read any of my other posts you can tell i'm usually pretty quick and short....hopefully you can tell by the length of my comment that this situation annoyed me",

    "text": "Hot N Juicy is a super fun place- you definitely need to go here once, especially if you've never had crawfish.  That being said, next time I will be skipping the crawfish and opting for shrimp instead.  Crawfish are a TON of work for pretty much zero meat.  Yes you can suck the head, but it tastes like the murkiest part of the ocean and it's an unappealing, brown mushy substance (perhaps their tiny brain?).  Gross.  You order by the pound, and your meal comes with a boiled potato & corn on the cob.  They have calamari and other apps, as well as dinner rolls and rice.  The seasoning is where I give this place 4 stars.  You have your choice of seasonings (garlic butter, cajun, lemon pepper, etc)- the \"hot n juicy\" being a combination of them all.  You then choose from mild, med, spicy, and extra spicy (be forewarned that nothing is truly mild here).  You can choose from crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc. and all require work- but the shrimp yielded much more meat.  The sauce (I ordered medium) was heavenly- next time I will be opting for the shrimp and getting a side of rice to act as a vessel for this delicious fire sauce.  Definitely a simple concept, but lots of fun- especially w/ a group.  Oh- and be ready to wear a bib & get MESSY!",

    "text": "I've been hearing many rave about this place out in Vegas and being a crawfish lover myself, it was a must eat! It's pretty darn good, the Hot and Juicy flavoring is the one with all the flavors combined. Nice rich butter and garlic flavored paired with Cajun spices. Probably you're best bet if you come here. And the host wasn't kidding when she said theirs is usually a little bit hotter than you think with the added garlic. I have a decent tolerance for spicy and normally here in San Jose I can eat the medium or spicy (on good days) and have no problem. I ordered the Mild and it already had a big kick to it. I do definitely want to come back because the day we came they said crawfish is in season but I know it really wasn't and so the crawfish was small and many of them were black and dead. The meat of the crawfish was not crispy and very flaky, not fresh at all. Great service by the waiter and host though.",

You have a mixture of different people eating and working there. It's an awesome casual place to hang out, watch sports, and most importantly enjoy some crawfish.  You really can't go wrong with the Hot n Juicy Special. It's packed with flavor. I really like spicy foods but when I ordered extra spicy, I really thought I needed a two liter with me to just get through the meal.  The only downside to the restaurant is the parking. There is absolutely no parking during the weekend at dinner time. If you happen to park in the massage parking spot for two seconds (I happened to be picking up a to go meal), this angry little Asian woman will come out screaming at you. So if you are coming for dinner, be prepared to park in the next plaza.",

The complainers about this place can only complain about waiting. I would wait an hour or more no problem! The service was outstanding. When they dumped those bags of seafood on the table without utensils or plates, I knew it would be good. We ordered the crawfish hot n juicy style but mild and the garlic shrimp. Both were great but the crawfish are alot of work for a little meat so my favorite was peeling the shrimp and dipping it in the hot n juicy sauce from the crawfish. MMMMMMM! I can still taste em. I will go here every trip to Vegas from here on out! We went on a weekday and had no wait at all but it was busy.",

I normally order crawfish, but they were out of louisiana crawfish, but  they had crawfish from northern California. VERY smart. They had a backup plan and they succeeded. I mean these suckers were HUGE. Mini lobsters, I'm telling you. Very fresh, flavorful, and so full of meat. Then the clams, they weren't overcooked. They were big, and dare I say it, JUICY. Yummers. Shrimp. Good. Not overcooked, easy to peel and tasted great.  And they've got a second location, which I've been to. And you can always call to see what their inventory is. And if they don't have it earlier in the day, they definitely will by dinner time. Highly highly recommended. This is the spot to go when you're in Vegas. Oh, by the way, I've been here at least 4 times in the past 8 months, and I live in California. This is always a stop.",

It was a good experience, the staff is super friendly.  We ordered 2lbs of the (spicy) hot & juicy crawfish and 1lb of the king crab, some sausages, corn and Cajun fries.  It was alright... satisfying, but definitely not the best I've ever had.  The crawfish were pretty small, and when they're small like that you have to work harder to get to the actual meat, which kinda sucked since the meat was super duper small.  The crab was really good, and I really liked the sausages, but I remember them being pretty expensive.  I think we paid an extra $6 to get six slices of andouille sausage.  The corn is the neutralizer, which is necessary if you can't handle the heat.    The cajun fries were so-so, our next trip we will do w/out them.  Next time, I'd like to try the shrimp and maybe clams (if they have them) and I'll probably try the medium instead of the spicy so I'm not constantly asking for more water.",

I go to eat out alone more than others because of my work schedule and manage to enjoy it because it's a treat to not have to cook, to have someone wait on you  making sure you're happy and last but not least you leave without having to clean any dishes. Well if you're expecting to leave here satisfied and happy think again!!!! By the time I was walking to my car I felt like I shouldn't try any new places for a few months, then I realized I wouldn't like anyone else to leave with a stomachache and headache like I did so I had to come online and review with details.   Exactly what happened: After I ordered I was left to be ignored like if I was paying with Monopoly money. Apparently  my \"waitress\" seems to have had a limited energy source and giving me good customer service would've drained her too much. So when I needed limes, more salt&pepper etc.. I had to ask the waitress closest to my table. If that wasn't bad enough my fried fish tasted like it was fried with old oil and the fries were tasteless because I was hungry I just tried to eat it and not complain. Then came the crab legs and although I specifically told the waitress I didn't want them to be spicy, she said I had to choose one strength of spicy and that baby spice was very light. Well light it was not, it was spicy, my lips were burning and my stomach felt punched with just one little piece of crab leg. If it had not been for another young lady that stepped up and asked what was wrong and how could she make it better I would've left feeling worse. They took the crab legs off the table and tab so I paid immediately. Left a cash tip to the girl that was nice and made sure to leave a handwritten note on the credit card auth to the other. Hopefully the manager sees it and provides better service training.   That's as much as my queasy stomach allows me to write. Good luck!!",

My sister, brother and friend went on Sunday afternoon and we ordered:  Soft Shell Crab - It was good and the fries had a kick to it. Etouffee - Flavorful and pretty spicy. 1 lb. Crawfish - Lots of work, but fun to eat. 1 lb. Clams - These were actually pretty disappointing. Also, seemed to be more empty shells than clams. 1 lb. Shrimp - OMG....I'm not a big shrimp fan, but I ate so many of these.  We went back Monday with two other friends and ordered:  Fried Shrimp - These were ok, but the batter was a bit too thick. Cajun Fries - Still had a kick to it. 2 lb. Crawfish extra corn - Still was good 2 lb. Shrimp - YUM! 2 lb. Snow Crab - Oh these were good too, but one of our friend inhaled most of it.......I know not to go with him again. 1 lb. Clams - Yeah, I would stay away from these as they are not worth it. 7 Garlic Butter Corn - These were so good. We ordered 4 first and we ended up ordering an additional 3. Must try these!  We ordered mild for all of it and it does make your tongue and lips burn, but seems to fade away by the time you leave. I am definitely going to go CRAZY next time and try......medium! =)  I thought the staff was awesome. There was a mix up and they ended up giving us 1 lb. snow crab on the house which most places wouldn't. Awesome!  I also thought the prices to be very reasonable!   Can't wait to go back! This is going to our place to go when in Vegas.",

We saw them on Man vs Food and we just HAD to try it.  Looked soooo good on tv!!!  And they didnt disappoint :)  Pick a seafood (Raw Oysters 1/2 Dozen/ Dozen, Dungeness Crab (Seasonal), Blue Crab (Seasonal), King Crab, Snow Crab Legs, Lobster, Clams, Shrimp, Crawfish) then pick a seasoning (Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special), how many lbs and pick how HOT you want it!!  This all comes out to you in huge clear plastic bags and you've got a nice roll of paper towels on the butcher paper covered table to keep yourself somewhat 'clean'.  Oh ya, take the bib and ask for gloves (we didnt know about the gloves....)  *Hot and Juicy special crawfish (1lb HOT): my fave, savory hot and juicy.  Totally garlicky and enough spice to really plump up your lips.  You're sweating and maybe even getting a runny nose...but who cares...it's soooo good! Always dunk in the sauce before eating. YUM! *Garlic butter crawfish (1 lb HOT): even MORE garlic, really buttery and HOT.  I found this to be pretty salty too but fiance loved it. *Cajun shrimp (1lb HOT): really meaty, plump n juicy fresh shrimp.  once you peel be sure to dip the meat in the sauce...mmm *Sweet potato fries: super crisp (crispiest sweet potato fries i've ever had) altho the sweet potato flavor didnt seem as strong.  Great vehicle for MORE sauce! mmm also helps in putting out \"some\" of the fire going on in your mouth  mmm crawfish....we really need this spot in nyc!!!",

I came to Vegas, with the saying \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" Well I cant express how much I love this place and how yummy the crawfish, shrimp, mussels, and sweet potato fries were.   Great service, they were very quick and attentive. The food was amazing packed with flavors, definitely better than boiling crab. Their sauce comes with chopped potatoes that absorbs all of the flavor from the sauce, yummy...  The shrimp: big, hot, and juicy. haha the shrimp tasted fresh and did I mention juicy? Crawfish: I am not a big fan of these little critters because it takes so much effort just to eat the little meat they have. But these guys here are pretty big.  mussels: my favorite! you guys gotta order these!  sweet potato fries: crispy on the outside soft and sweet in the inside (:  Definitely have to come back here again while I am in Vegas!",

Instead of leaving it on the table they took at back to the kitchen.  This is a total no-no.  Don't let customers think you are switching out food - I had already stuck my dirty fork into the one they snatched back from me and brought back to someone else within 1 minute.   I also didn't get what I ordered.  The food was average.  I decided to try this location after a horrible experince at another location of the same chain several months back.  The crawfish are especially small and impossible to eat because they break apart trying to get them out of the shell.  They really screwed up the crawfish bad.  I've eaten a lot of crawfish.  The shrimp on the other hand is top notch - sweet, wonderful texture, easy to eat.   I'll try this place again next time I save up another hundred dollar bill to afford it.  When that happens I guarantee I will not eat the crawfish.  The difference between 2 stars (Meh.  I've experienced better.) and 3 stars (A-OK) is not screwing up the orders and if you do make it right then and there.   I may add or subtract a star when I return depending on service.",

    "text": "When I first landed in Vegas, my cousin couldn't stop talking about this place. We are both from Chicago, so unfortunately, they do not have a location by us. He have tried this place tons of times before and since he hyped this place up so much, I had to try it myself.  The first day, we tried 2lbs of crawfish, crab legs, and shrimp. We also got the cajun fries, which is a good compliment to all those seafood. We got everything with the hot and juicy mild sauce because this was what my cousin recommended. Everything was so good, but I didn't really like the crawfish. They are small and requires more time to eat than the shrimp and crab legs. You also get very little out of the crawfish. I would not recommend this. The shrimp and crab legs are really good and the sauce was perfect!  The second time we came back here was a few days later. We came back with a bigger group and ordered a storm again. This time we only ordered shrimp, crab legs, and cajun fries again. Everything was once again perfect and I wanted to come back here again before we left back to Chicago. Sadly, this was my last time here and till this day, I would come here as my 1st stop after landing in Vegas. I also must say that after all this food, my gf and uncle threw up afterwards. Everyone else was fine though.  I also heard that this location is better than the other location, but I have never tried the other one yet. Also, for all you outsiders, prepare to get your hands dirty and do not wear a white shirt. It is messy and you eat with gloves and a bib.",

Told us that the crawfish can come pretty spicy so order one down, so we got the mild (wimps we are).   We ordered beers and our crawfish were fun little buggers to eat, however it does come in a soupy bag, and the amount of garlic is nuts. My vampire husband got a little queasy, he doesn't handle garlic too well, next time he will try one of their other fun items. My breath was humming till the next morning, but I'm cool with that. I also got a cute tank top! If you come to Vegas often I would say you have to come here at least once.",

    "text": "I am very upset to give this location a 2 stars. I absolutely love HNJ Crawfish and have been going since the day it's opened. My visit here yesterday was not good, I ordered Cajun fries and when I got them they were such a small order, about half the size (in amount) they have been for years. I ordered all my food in hot n juicy medium sauce and when I got it the sauce was as thin as water. It used to be thicker and would coat your food, it was delicious. Unfortunately with the extremely thin sauce it didn't coat anything and wasn't as flavorful. The crawfish was over cooked and the 2 lbs of clam was more shells than clams. If this were my first experience here, I'd never return. This has happened a few times at this original location. The waitress was also very annoying trying to take my fries away when I wasn't even done with them, she did this 3 times, I practically had to shove the rest in my mouth so I didn't have to tell her not to take the basket again. She also forget to get my drink and I had to go to the register and ask someone else if they could get my drink. When I asked the waitress why the food has changed and she was rude and said she didn't know and maybe it happened with a new chef and gave me a dirty look. This was a very disappointing  trip.",

PROS: The shrimp was ridiculously good and damn spicy like I like it, crawfish was yummy too. Being a newbie I would say my first time was memorable =)  CONS: Service was a bit whack at first but nothing major to bring the place down. I had to keep asking for water and my cousin had to re-order her shrimp because they didn't ask her what kind of sauce she wanted. Luckily, the rest of us were hungry and ate her order, and she re-ordered... so, it worked out!  Beware! I was hurting after this... good lawd! If you plan on going to a club that night... make sure you go HOURS and HOURS before or else you're gonna have to go when you have to go. LOL.

It did take a few minutes to be seated and get our order in, but they were understaffed and were all busting their butts to clean tables and get food out. Once we got our food in, it only took 10 minutes for it to hit our table.   I order the shrimp with Juicy Cajun Sauce and a corn and potato. The shrimp was huge and delious. My bf ordered the crayfish and they were really small and disappointing. He got the Hot and Juicy sauce, which was way better then my sauce. Overall, I would push the shrimp over the crayfish, but it was a fun eating experience and I can't wait to go there again the next time I am in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Delicious and well priced!  Ordered shrimp, crawfish, king crab legs, corn, sweet potato fries and sausage. All was great. A few tips: 1- hot & juicy sauce is definitely spicy. Ordered mild and it's what most people would consider medium hot.   2- crab legs were delicious in the lemon pepper sauce. Not the best bang for your buck because of the shell weight. That said, most gratifying in terms of how much meat comes out of each leg. Worth a try for sure!  3- rolls. This was a last minute addition and one I'd highly suggest. Order some rolls (they came out nice and warm) to dip in the sauce- perfect way to round out the meal  4- gloves. They don't offer them unless you ask and its worth it. They have thin plastic disposable gloves which come in VERY handy especially with all the spicy sauces you're dipping into.  This place is worth going to again and again. Came in on a weekday around 8PM and the wait was approximately 20 minutes. Moved along quickly and most definitely worth the wait!",

The crawfish is good, but doesn't have a lot of meat, so instead I recommend that you opt for shrimp.  As for choice of sauce, I definitely recommend the Hot N' Juicy Special - almost as good as Boiling Crab.  The red potatoes and corn on the cob are good choices for add-ons and come right in the bag with the seafood smothered in sauce.   You WILL use your hands to eat, and you WILL get dirty and possibly reek of garlic for the next few days.  So this place is a definite no for a 1st or even 2nd and 3rd date (or the day before any date). As for price, the bill came out to around $60 for 2 people (shrimp, crab, sides and  2 ice cold beers). I give this place 3.7 stars.",

We ordered a bunch of dungie and crawdads along with some baskets of fried stuff.  Over the course of the next hour we did our best to eat it all--we ordered too much--while having fun with the people at the tables around us.    All in all it was a great crowd and we had a good time.",

    "text": "I go to Vegas FOR this place's crawfish.  I'm a huge fan of Cajun style seafood and they do it very well here. I haven't experienced a significant difference in the different spiciness levels. Also, definitely choose at least mild. My rating is basically for the taste of the Crawfish. It's exactly the way I like it. The only problem is it's in vegas and you usually do other things there like sit through a 2-3 hour show or go to an area with a lot of other people who will smell the garlicy cajun sauce all over your breathe and fingers.  The service as I remember has been fine every time (twice with a year a separation between). I have only ordered the crawfish although my friends said the shrimp was great too. It's a messy experience so don't wear clothes you mind getting dirty.  I have nothing but good memories. I always eat too much and border on destroying my stomach but i mean... look at what you're eating. There has to be some enormous bag of cayenne pepper somewhere in the kitchen. I never regret it though and I even wake up the next day wanting to do it again. There is however a lot of garlic involved so ... think about what you're doing that evening.  I suggest doing it the night before you leave (sleep it off and clear your system before you fly ... DO THIS...) and maybe before the part of the vacation you don't have anything special planned.",

Ended up taking 1/2 the bag of shrimp home.   I love the seasoning! Its so tasty and spicy! Very thick and messy! I love that they provide a bib (very much needed!)  Surprisingly, I didn't care too much for crawfish. I feel like it was so much work just for a little piece of tail. The shrimp on the other hand, much more meatier and I guess I like the taste of the heads on shrimp than I did with the crawfish. The crab was da bomb as well!   Second time around, only ended up getting shrimp and snow crab again! We got the seasoning where you mix everything together! sooooo good!   You pay extra for corn, red potatoes and sausage. I usually add a couple corns and potatoes to the bag.  IF it is busy, you will have to wait awhile. You can occupy youself by looking at the wall of poloroid pictures. Trust me, even though its torture waiting to be seated and seeing all this delicious smelling food coming out, ITS WELL WORTH IT!",

    "text": "My friends and I were so excited about eating here.  We were so disappointed with the service.  It took forever for someone to take our order and so hard to flag down someone when we needed to get a server.  We order half a dozen oysters.  When it was brought out, the oysters looked like someone ate off it and not fresh. We tried to get a server over to point out the problem and that took 15 minutes and she told us to hold on and sent over a manager that took another 10 minutes. We asked nicely if we could get a different batch and she said their all the same. So we politely asked to send the oysters back.  The manager said sorry can't do that. My friends and I said fine, we'll pay for it but we still like them to take the oysters away.  Later, I guess the manager realize we weren't happy and it could effect their tips so she walked over and said she will give us half off the oysters. Ridiculous!!! Such bad customer service.  When you go eat at restaurants and the food is not to your satisfaction you have the right to send it back right away and the managers should take the charge off your bill and ask if you would like to order something else. Not this place.  They were more concern with making money then the well being of their customers eating old oysters and could possibly get sick from it.  We will not return here again.  This place is just a mimic of Boiling Crab, the only difference is Boiling Crab has better flavoring and better service.",

WTFERAK??? i was freakingggg out!!!! needless to say we ended up in old las vegas (downtown) since i found a bathroom! that was bad... so make sure you are careful with the spicyness!!!!!",

One tip, do NOT forget to get the corn. It is brought to you in the bag along with your seafood and garlicky goodness (get the Hot n Juicy special). I have never had better corn. Oh, and do NOT wear fancy clothes there. You WILL smell like garlic for a few days...but I really didnt care. It was worth it!",

So my goal was to try to eat here for new years eve as 1 of my last meals for 2009.  Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, that's what we ordered along with the shrimp.  So 4 lbs of food between 2 people along with rice for my friend.  Since I am from Cali, we do have to compare every place to Boiling Crab.  So far, BC is the top.  This place would come in 2nd place.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the seafood since they are market price.  I wish they did post the prices up somewhere but they don't so you do have to ask how much it is per lb for the seafood items.  You do have to order the Hot N Juicy flavoring.  We didn't do the extra spicy and spicy was good enough for us since it did make our nose watery.  As for the size of the crawfish, they were sooo small.  I thought they might be a little bit bigger, but nope.  Small that I even had to take a picture of it since I think I was in shock from the size of it.  ;p  None the less, it was still yummy and I would definitely go back if I was craving crawfish in lv.  Note to remember, you do have to ask for the bibs and salt, pepper, lime sauce since they don't bring it to you initially like BC.  Service was pretty good except there was 1 waitress that seemed a little bit rude when she was talking to the guests so not sure if she was having an off day or if that's just her personality.",

    "text": "Some friends found this place on Yelp so we decided to give it a try!  55 reviewers can't be wrong!  4.5 stars?  I'm there!  Wait, I think these 55 people have never tried crawfish anywhere else =/  I actually can't say too much about the crawfish because I ordered a pound of shrimp.  Based on seasoning (which would have been the same with crawfish anyway), I'd say 3 stars.  My friend's pound of crawfish came with huge crawdaddies and my shrimp were pretty big, too so thumb's up for that!  I ordered the Hot n Juicy Special, which is probably all the others mixed together and was satisfied with my shrimp.  However, I ordered medium and it wasn't spicy at all.  I ordered half a dozen sausages with my shrimp and they were big pieces.  I also ordered a side of corn on the cob but they forgot it so I had to remind them.  When it came out, I took a bite and made the ugliest face ever.  I threw the rest away because it was bitter and drenched in too much seasoning (but I can't really complain about the second part).  I tried my friend's order of Cajun Fries (medium) and THOSE were spicy!  The fries came out crunchy and fat (skinny fat, not fat fat, if you know what I mean lol), which were yummy-o!  I also tried my friend's deep fried soft shell crab and I don't think I'm a big fan of soft shell crab (I don't even love it in sushi rolls).  However, he enjoyed it.  The decor is much like any other crawfish restaurant, it was spacious and the setting was comfortable.  The service is mediocre; no smiling faces but they refilled my drink before I realized I even needed a refill!  Overall, I like you Hot n Juicy.  You didn't disappoint me (but that may have been because I already knew nothing would ever beat Boiling Crab!)  I love that everything was BIG and that the seasoning didn't suck.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to try crawfish in every city you visit, you won't be disappointed but you won't come out thinking it's the best place in the world either.",

    "text": "I have to say I am a bigger fan of Crawdaddy's in San Jose, CA than I am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at Crawdaddy's.  We ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two corns and cajun fries. We ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the garlic butter sauce.  I was not feeling the Hot N Juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the garlic butter, lemon pepper and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. The garlic butter that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) Both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which I did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. My favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy garlic buttery taste - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'll tell ya! I think if we never got the Hot N Juicy sauce I would have liked the crawfish better.  The service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  He was nice but we had asked for extra sauce and some extra corns - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. In my head I'm thinking \"COME ON FOOL!  I WANT MY CORN AND EXTRA SAUCE! WTF YOU TALKING FOR?! THAT WON'T GET YOU A GOOD TIP!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - I guess we could just call that our dessert ;)  Thanks to MVF we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but I think if were in Vegas again we wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "It was difficult for me to give this place a five star because the spicy level is so confusing. If I recall right, there's five different spicy levels and four seasonings you can choose from. We ordered medium spicy which was the second level right above plain. I figured the food might taste too plain with no spice added so I went with the medium. The seasoning we chose was  hot and juicy so that might have burned out our tongues. I'm okay with spicy food whereas my gf isnt. So I had to carefully choose what we can both enjoy. The food turned and to be too hot and spicy for my gf and fairly hot for me as well! To think that there's three other spicy levels above what we ordered was crazy.. perhaps a little change or an update on the menu to better describe how spicy the food is could save a lot of people's tongues.",

It was a smallish place and parking is tight. Best bet park across the street and walk over. 530 and there was a wait. Not long at only 10 minutes. Food comes in a plastic bag and with food service gloves. Oh and a bib is included.  You better use them all. We had shrimp and some crab and they were delicious. The medium spice was plenty and I prefer more spice than most. Just be aware you get the whole shrimp. Head legs shell so be prepared to peel. Remember those gloves i mentioned. Yeah use them. Staff was really friendly and efficient. I like this place and will eat here in the future. Oh and the prices were very reasonable. Enjoy.",

The oysters show and are partially cooked? Not good at all, very disappointing. The crab came and 5 minutes later the catfish, we ordered the brownie dessert which I was billed for but never received, lyft ride was there and didn't have time to fight it.

I came here cause I saw an ad on insta of their po boy sandwiches which I absolutely love. First time ever to one of these types of seafood restaurants and I was beyond impressed. With their service, the sauces and flavors.   We had a shrimp po boy and soft shell crab po boy. Shrimp was my favorite and we got the Cajun fries with one of them.  They're not really spicy, they just have like an extra crispy coating outside of it which was really yummy. The Cajun fries are so so so much better than just the regular fries.   Then we wanted to try their sauce and food they serve in the bags. So we got sausage, corn and potatoes with medium hot and juicy. FREAKING AMAZING. All of it was good but the corn was exceptional. Especially when it's drenched and soaking up all the sauces. Its cooked perfectly, it's like so tender where it comes off the cob easily. It's so good!!! Best corn I've ever had.  We also tried the corn fritters which is like corn hushpuppies. They were good. But the corn and sausage In that hot and juicy sauce was too good!   If you enjoy flavorful food seasoned to perfection you gotta come and try this place. Even if your not a huge seafood person there's other options that you just have to try. TOO GOOD!   TUNGUSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! (Too much good stuff / ampm commercial lol)",

I went here recently and the medium wasn't too spicy, but I feel like I have had it spicier here. I love the flavors here. The crab is delicious as well and so are the french fries. When you have a lot of sauce, you got to have rice. I can just eat the sauce and rice on it's own. That's how much I like the sauce!  Service is standard, they're usually running back and forth so they're busy. There is a small parking lot you can park in or do street parking. Until next time hot n juicy!",

They gave me a lot of Crawfish in this dish and only 2 Crab Legs which I did not like. This dish came with 2 pieces of corn and 2 potatoes, for the price I believe there could have been more of both and Crab Legs. The shrimp is not deveined which threw me off a bit but overall the food was seasoned to perfection, I would definitely stop in any time I am in town!",

The dining experience is much different than what I'm use to. The food comes out in a double bag. One contains your food and the other can be used for your shells. If you want to throw your shells on the table, that's fine too! The table cloth is disposable :)  Another thing that was different was the order the food was served. The dishes came out as they were ready. So, some of us were drooling at each other's food while we waited for ours to come.",

We got there around 5:15 pm there weren't too many people waiting, but there was no hostess at the desk, because there was only one on duty. There was a 40 minute wait to get seated. We left for 45 min to the bar down the walkway, still no text, came in and the lady that came after us was seating already eating with her family. No hello how are you from ANYONE. Every single person treated you like any question was a nuisance. Our food took another 40 minute. I got medium heat and it was extremely hot, no warning on that btw. Our table didn't get the crab leg slicers because they ran out.  Our food came out at two different time so we had to wait on my friend to get her food before we ate, even though we all ordered the same exact thing. Aside from the extremely hot sauce the food was cooked well. But for our 1lb of snow crabs and they gave us all 1 claw. I buy seafood very often. A pound of snow crab is 8-10 legs, so about two claws. The snow crab here was no bigger than the nom. Just all around bad business. Raise the prices if you want more money but don't manipulate your customer.  I would not recommend this place. Go to boiling crab, at least they have integrity, they have the same food, more space, MUCH better service.",

The waitresses are inattentive and act like they are busy even when there are barely patrons there. It's almost like they're faking lol. Their hot n juicy special sauce is bangin!!! Crabs are fleshy and claws complete unlike other places. Their juicy hot is really hot so be careful with your spice level. Not a lot of parking in the teeny tight complex so pray to meet them on a slow day. The price matches the quality & quantity so I can't complain about sides like corn and potatoes being an add on.

Met by a great waitress. The place itself was cool and a little divey (no, there is no lobster grabbing machine here). Ordered an Abita (#nola), a pound crawfish, a half of shrimp, corn, and rice on the side. Medium strength. I was deliciously on fire as I hoped to be.

Before you dig into your plastic bag of seasoned seafood, I would advise you to put on the proper gear. Slip that logo-imprinted plastic apron on and secure those gloves, because you are in for some hot mess. I happily obliged prior to feasting through my bag of frozen Louisiana crawfish in the mildly spiced hot n juicy sauce. For the next 15 minutes, my gloved hands and lips were dripping in red. Piece after piece, I was stuffing my face in what seemed to be the most satisfying meal ever. Keep in mind, all of this was a mere $6.99.   I would come here anytime and every time I am in Vegas!",

The crab was fresh and oooh so good. Gotta say I love that when you order spicy, it's exactly that. I was only slighly dissappointed on the waitress serving us, considering its pretty small, we had to flag her down a couple of times to get what we needed.

I tried a couple of the crawfish, and they were coo, I couldn't really get past the ripping of the heads and what not. BUT, I had their king crab legs, in the cajun seasoning and a side potato and corn and it was probably the best crab legs I have ever had!

Gone are the flashing lights, white tablecloths and candles, replaced by beer in bottles, cheesy lobster bibs and food served in plastic bags.  I will say, though, that it was delicious.  I got the crawfish boil with the signature sauce.  The sauce can be ordered to whatever level of heat you desire.  I went for the extra spicy, which I will warn lives up to its name.    There is a lot of flavor here, and the sides were no less disappointing.  From the sweet potato fries to the corn on the cob, everything was excellent.  This place is obsessed with quality through simplicity, and it's no surprise that the crawfish is shipped in fresh each morning.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the prices.  Everything here is priced well below what I would consider reasonable for what is delivered, making this a huge value for the dollar.  If you're hankering for something more low key, more down home and (way) less glamourous than what's on offer on Las Vegas Boulevard, stop on in.",

They have a scale of spicy level you want from hot medium mild. Price is somewhat a little higher than it's competitors. The dining inside seems to be always packed and somewhat noisy. All the servers went female and somewhat reminds me of hooters..",

You have to be willing to work for every bite, but boy oh boy is every bite worth it. I usually get the snow crab or the shrimp with the lemon seasoning.   I always have to get my area situated and ready before the beautiful sight of bags full of butter and critters! =] It is messy so don't plan on wearing your cute outfit for the night! Although you do get a classy bib to wear.  Also, be aware that you could possibly smell like butter for awhile.  But despite the lingering smell, this is a MUST HAVE MUST GO!  The service is great and the food is even better!",

I got a pound of house special marinated crawfish, and lemon pepper marinated shrimp to go.  The crawfish and the sauce was delicious.  The crawfish meat was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was rich and spicy.  The lemon pepper sauce was also very good, but the shrimp, while big, didn't taste as fresh, since the meat was a little mushy where you take the head off the shrimp.  I asked the waitress how hot the \"medium\" spice level was at, and she said 8/10, soo... I opted for \"mild\" which was just right: not too spicy that I won't enjoy the meal, but had just enough kick to prove quite tasty.",

The service was a bit slacking , as we had to ask 3 different servers to please bring us the salt/pepper/lemon combo before we started to eat our meal.  We also had to ask for water refills, which I hate doing after working in a restaurant that focused highly on being attentive to all customers and anticipating their needs.  But of course, the food was amazing!  I am a creature of habit and ordered a pound of shrimp, Hot N Juicy style, with Medium spice.  We also added some corn and sausage into the mix.

It seems like they fried their shirmp in corn meal which gave it a tasty bite and crunch. I think that was the only difference and you don't have to wait an 1 1/2 hour in line like Boiling Crab in Garden Grove. Prices I think are a little more expensive but hey they got to ship everything to Vegas... I would come back esp. for the Fried Shrimp.",

    "text": "Any place that makes me crave to come back is getting 5 stars from me!  I finally convinced a couple of friends to try the infamous Hot n Juicy for the first time.  None of us had been here before, but I am pretty sure all of us are returning soon!  We ordered two pounds of crawfish, and a pound each of shrimp and snow crab.  We opted for the Hot n Juicy sauce, medium spice.  The spice level of the sauce was right about on for us (although we may go hotter next time!), and the flavor was extremely good.  It was some sort of a garlic sauce that made sucking the juices out of these crustaceans so addicting.    The shrimp were by far our favorite.  Nice and big in size, and juicy.  They weren't that hard to peal really, with the heads on them.  The crawfish were also tasty, although there was a lot less meat in them (obviously).  I am not a big crawfish eater, but these were so damn good that I probably would get them again just for the experience of cracking them open!  The money paid for the crawfish versus how much meat you get might not be worth it to some, but the experience is worth it to me.  The blue crab legs were few, but large and extremely delicious!  I can't wait to come back, so Hot n Juicy is getting a 5 star review from me.  The waitresses are cute and friendly and they'll make sure you know how to crack those shellfish!  This place definitely deserves the A+ reputation that it has earned.",

    "text": "When I think of Hot n Juicy, my first thought is not crawfish. Probably more along the lines of Megan Fox, Denise Richards, or Megan Good. Crawfish has always been a tough food for me to try. It looks like a ghetto version of a lobster crossed with shrimp and for the longest time I have given it the nickname of \"Little Cockroach\". I always felt why would you eat a crawfish on purpose? It's like choosing ground beef when you can have steak. Shrimp has always been my favorite weapon of choose for any of these cajun \"Boiling Crab\" type places, because of the efficient flavor to value ratio. A Crawfish is usually about 9 to 10 bucks a pound and is about 60% shell and 40% meat (I will later find out 90% shell or greater and less than 10% meat). Trust me for a pound of crawfish. You will pay a handsome penny and will not have enough meat to make a crab salad or even an appetizer with crackers.   How did you find out about Hot N Juicy Crawfish? How does it taste though?? How's the quality? Stop being negative! You might say.  I am guilty of watching Man Vs Food like the majority of all the yelp reviews for this restaurant. Normally, MVF's track record has been fairly poor, but this is different! Who doesn't like Asian flavors crossed with Cajun style? That's like saying you don't like Amerie (so hot!) or Hines Ward (not as hot). I ordered 1 lb Shrimp and 1lb of Crawfish to give Crawfish a try and have my shrimp as a back up, both Hot n Juicy style.   The shrimp was great of course, although it was slightly under cooked. I think that's because maybe no one ever orders shrimp. It was a nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized and it tasted pretty good with the Hot N Juicy sauce, but nothing to jump out of your seat over. Shrimp is a dollar more than crawfish, but its worth it, because it is 95% meat and 5% shell. Time for my first taste of crawfish! At first, I honestly did not know how to eat it. I tried using my shrimp peeling skills, but I looked like a squirrel trying to get a nut. I finally swallowed my pride and asked one of the pretty waitress to help show me how to suck head. Get your mind out the gutter!!! Ha ha.. but that's how you are suppose to eat crawfish. You first suck the head, that's what she said (that's what she said) then you eat the meat. Hmmm.. Good thing this review is PG. The flavor of the juicy coming from the crawfish was a lot better than the shrimp! The taste is very delicious. It's like sipping a hot bowl of pho and some zesty tomato based Italian dish. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Let's say the restaurant smelled and tasted like a cross between a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant and a Cajun grill.   If you look around the restaurant you will see nothing, but people with smiles on their faces. This is unusually, because most restaurants I go to most people look impatient or serious. This is definitely a plus! My rating might be a tad bit harsh, but I feel it is truly honest. I do recommend that you give Hot N Juicy a try, only if you get there early and don't mind driving in to \"Chinatown\" (didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants, but all Asians look a like right? Don't answer that). If you are from Orange County and are spoiled by the Boiling Crab and other restaurants like it, be warned you may not like this place. There is less spicy and a little less flavor. If you are a Asian Cajun newbie, this will be a great start for you. I will go back again with my friends that have watched Man Vs Food, but I'm not a fan of great head with no meat, no pun intended.",

The people behind us sat down 15 mins later and got there food 15 mins before us. I couldn't forget that they brought us potatoes that were hard as a rock I couldn't get anyone's attention so I walk up to the counter and the lady behind there is on the register and she was very rude telling me she was off but will take care of it and we never saw our new potatoes , by the time she came to us I asked about them she tells me I guess the waitress misunderstood you and our kitchen is closed. Over all food is pretty good service was terrible and I will never go back to this one. The ladies in there need help they were all over the place not just one all of them were.

This time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy Hot N Juicy special, one pound in medium garlic butter, one pound in extra spicy Hot N Juicy special, one pound of spicy Hot and Juicy special crawfish, and one pound of spicy Louisiana Style crawfish. Out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. Their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor I was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. The other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. We had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. The sweet potato and Cajun fries are cooked to a superb crispiness. Ask for corn and potatoes to be cooked with your seafood.  Yet again I could not resist the temptation and ordered a Blue Moon to go along with the meal. I might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since I have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon are the beers they offer for $3.  I cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. For a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. Yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. They cannot be faulted for that. I understand the need to meet the demands. Once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders.",

I can't believe I'm missing out on all this crazy goodness. This place is simply the bomb!  We got each a pound of shrimp and crawfish and man was that good. The shrimp was absolutely to die for and the crawfish is just so so. The shrimp was big and juicy and really easy to peel but the crawsfish was pretty small and hard to peel. We got garlic butter as the seasoning and it really complimented the spicyness. One thing, they take spicy seriously.. Our food had a less mild mix and I thought it was already really spicy. Can't really eat them without rice in my opinion. I recommend ordering their sausage too. It was very yummy with their garlic butter seasoning. However, get ready to wait in line before getting seated cause this place tends to get really crowded.  In other words, this place is really the sh*t!! I would go back here soon... very soon... Amazing place! go go go try this joint out!",

I ordered two different flavors of shrimp with one pound each. But the server somehow only heard one flavor. Everyone else in my table heard that I ordered two flavors.   It's fine when someone makes a mistake. It could happen to anyone. But, he insisted that he was not wrong. Instead of apologizing, he actually offered me to order another pound of shrimp of the flavor I want. Really?? Is he trying to upsell me another pound of shrimp in this situation? Or is he just too afraid to admit that he had made a mistake. Maybe he afraid that his manager will say something to him.    Maybe it was my fault that I didn't say it clear enough. Or maybe he is just not taking our orders seriously. Regardless of who is wrong or right, he shouldn't act so unprofessional. I was not that mad until how he handled this situation.   Luckily all other servers were really nice. Food was good as usual.",

Fried calamari wasn't that great, not worth 9.95.  Fries were a bit over spicy; felt the fries were more spicier than the crawfish medium spiciness.  Crawfish and shrimps were pretty decent size.

    "text": "Hot & Juicy crawfish is a nice, tasty alternative to the bland, pricey food on the Strip. Located in Chinatown, less than 10 minutes from the Strip, this joint was also featured on Man Vs. Food. I honestly wasn't looking too forward to eating here (I'm not huuuuuuge on seafood) but my bf really was, so I manned up and we went.  We ordered 2 lbs of the Hot & Juicy special sauce + medium spice level. The waitress did warn us that their spice levels are a little higher than most places, but I thought \"Eh, it'll be fine.\" No! No! Not fine! This is liquid death! But it hurts SOOOOOOOOO good. The sauce is succulent and ridiculously flavorful. But it burns, all the way down to your soul. Oh boy does it burn. Be careful of what you order. After a while I couldn't even taste what was happening, the crawfish were so hot. I recommend getting a side dish (we got rice) to help soak up the heat, it really helps. It also is awesome that they offer free refills on your drinks, because trust me, you TOTALLY need it. After every bite I needed a huge gulp of cold liquid.  Oh, and after you eat here, make sure you're going to be very close to a toilet for the next couple of hours. Oh! And if you pay in cash, you get 3% off!",

    "text": "A-Okay  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but I wouldn't rule it out if it was a convenient choice and my group was large. We had a party of 8, ordered lots of things and just shared with the table. The service was friendly and attentive, the prices weren't bad, and the place was pretty clean inside even though both locations on this street are in raunchy strip malls, and this location has very little parking.   Corn Fritters: hands down the best thing we had here  Cat fish: yummy corn meal battered and seasoned perfectly Calamari: lightly battered fried golden okay on the seasoning Cajun Fries: a delicious smoldering fire in my mouth Plan Fries: Blah Juicy Cajun med spicy, and lemon pepper pounds of shrimp: okay very large juicy shrimp that were fresh, but they should marinate the shrimp in their many sauces or seasonings for a while before boiled or use more seasoning while boiling the sauce just didn't stick making the shrimp pretty bland.  Corn: Pretty good balanced the shrimp, although my mother didn't like that they put her piece in the juicy Cajun sauce instead of on the side. (simple fix if we return she can ask for it on the side so no biggie) Mozzarella sticks: okay nothing to write home about, jar marinara sauce   Sausage: Good and spicy I enjoyed the slices that were in the juicy Cajun sauce with the shrimp Sweet Potato Fries: I'm just not a fan of these but a few people at the table that are a fan said they were standard  So the reason this place has 3 stars:   1. Food was just okay I've been to places just like this before with kicked up flavor with more menu options  2. I don't drink soda and all they offer is soda and beer, no lemonade no iced tea (even though the website says they have iced tea, major fail for me)??? I was puzzled by this pretty much every restaurant I go to offers at least one non soda option 3. The timing for their food is completely retarded our food came out at least 8 minutes apart from each other like they have one boiling pot and one fryer.. the shrimp came out first (not our appetizers?) then the calamari dinner then the appetizers, then after 10 more minutes the 3 catfish dinners so half the table was done eating when the last 3 meals came out once again major fail!",

    "text": "Pretty good...for Vegas.  Here's my recap:  Parking could be better.  Not a lot of spaces.  Available spaces were a little tight.  Seated immediately upon entering.  The place was pretty busy.  Many tables with chairs, some with booths.  Some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  Servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  Menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, blue crab, dungeness crab, King crab, and snow crab.  All market prices.  Seasoning choices were Louisiana style, juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Hot N Juicy special.  Choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  Sides: corn, potato, sweet potato fries, cajun fries, rice, rolls, and sausage.  Also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  We ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one Louisiana style medium and the other juicy Cajun medium.  Bibs were served first.  The bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  We also ordered a side of white rice.  The cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  Constant line for men's restroom.  Only one person at a time.  Many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  The food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  I prefer this method.  The shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  Plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  The shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  There was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  Also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  The shrimp was head and shell on.  This requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  I lived in Louisiana for many years so I know there is a difference between Louisiana style and Cajun style, but I don't know why they made the distinction here.  Most patrons in Vegas won't know the difference.  The difference here is that Louisiana had more butter and Cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  The difference is almost not noticeable, but I prefer their Louisiana style.  The rice was okay.  All in all the food was pretty good.  We really enjoyed it.  On a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  That is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  Vegas patrons don't know any better.  Its kind of gross, but I ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  There were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but I would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at Cravin Cajun.  You get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  They do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  The server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  Shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side of rice was $2.  We really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  I tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  It was the best crawfish in Vegas.  Flavor was right, but a bit small for Louisiana standards.  I love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  I really like this place, but Cravin Cajun is better.",

You decide if you want it spiced mild, medium, strong or extra strong. We had the softshell crab appetizer, 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab legs. Mmmmm delicious!  Be prepared to eat with your hands and to get them covered in juice and sauce, but that only adds to the sensous quality of the experience.  The wait staff are all sweet and helpful; they seem genuinely happy that you're there, and if it's your first time they'll lead you through the challenge of what to order.  On a side note: I stupidly forgot my wallet on the table when I left. About an hour later (I still hadn't realized it was missing), one of the girls who works there showed up on my doorstep with the wallet. I wanted to kiss her!

On a weekday the place was pretty steady, the server were working as a team as well as the manager all of them went to our table to ask how we were. Water is constantly being filled. Food is pretty good, piping hot as a matter of fact that means it just came out fresh from the cooking pot.  Ordered shrimps, clams and crabs legs, beer. For two people that's a lot of food. We did not left any shrimp unpeeled. That's how good it was. Over all food and customer service -two thumbs up and so glad we gave it another try. Equals = we will be a repeat customer.",

It was messy and delicious and we got Cajun spices all over our beer glasses. :)   I have no idea how much it cost because my buddy grabbed the bill, but we got 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crab and 2 pounds of mussels to split between three people. It sounds like alot, but it was just enough, actually. Plus it came with a little corn on the cob and a little potato for each of us. We chose the medium level of spice, which was plenty spicy for me!   So this is food you have to WORK for. You have to tear the heads and legs off of the shrimp and peel them and you have to crack open your crab legs and pry the meat out. But it's WORTH it! The mussels required NO work and were delicious. The shrimp was, ya know, shrimp. The crab was delectable - I freakin' love a good juicy piece of crab meat. :)   We felt like three ravenous animals tearing apart food with our hands and leaving a mess of shells and sea creature parts behind. Awesome.   My boyfriend was not a fan of the chicken tenders he ordered; he said they were slightly worse than the kind you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. And they didn't have BBQ sauce, just ketchup and not-so-good ranch. So yeah. Get the seafood.",

We love getting the shrimp and crawfish with sausages and rice. a lot of rice. You need a whole lot to soak up all that delicious sauce. Get the hot n juicy special seasoning if you don't mind having garlic breath, if you don't want that the juicy Cajun is just as good. The mild is usually spicy enough so watch out if your not big on hot food. I love having those plastic bibs on and eating with my hands. Prices aren't bad at all. I think it's about $12/lbs for shrimp. Whenever we come we're seated right away. The servers are always friendly and the food comes out pretty fast. I would suggest coming here in clothes that's ready to go in the laundry coz it will end up smelling like garlic lol so leave your coats and jackets in the car!",

Not wanting to look like a complete creep and glutton peeling and mashing crawfish after crawfish into my mouth alone at a table for two; I took my order of Hot N Juicy Special Green Mussels (1lb) and Crawfish (1lb) to go.    Back at my lair, The Palms, I dutifully laid out my feast on plastic bibs as not to completely destroy the entire room.  After doing so I realized I was one bib short for mine own self!  Alas, this is where we turn down Creepy Drive.  After locking the door, hanging the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and drawing the blinds, I stripped down to my skivvies and feasted.    There is something quite liberating and simultaneously shaming about eating dinner in your underwear.  However, the satisfaction I received from gorging on the delicious shellfish washed away any lingering feelings of penitence.  Will be back, hopefully with friends, if not take out it is!",

We were seated promptly near the cashier counter and ladies' restrooms. Typical setup with the plastic table cover, roll of paper towels, and bibs to keep you clean. The server was friendly, and was well informed about the menu.   We ordered Etouffe, 2 pounds of shrimp in garlic butter and Cajun flavors.   The Etouffe was sooo flavorful and fresh! There were pieces of crawfish and shrimp in it. The rice was fluffly and not soggy like you would think the soup would do to it.   The shrimp was the 30/40 size with the head one. I think they are probably from frozen but they were still good. I know it's time consuming but I wish they would have de-veined the shrimp. I'm not a fan of the black digestive tract.  I would definitely come back.",

But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer.   We started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else!   The snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!  Overall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy! Great seafood, great experience, and great sauces!",

    "text": "I finally got to try the original Hot N Juicy Crawfish during my recent trip to Vegas last week!  After getting dropped off in a cab at Boiling Crab and finding out that they were out of crawfish, (!!!) a group of 9 of us literally walked a mile to Hot N Juicy.  We split our orders into 2, and my group ordered:   - 10 pounds of crawfish, hot, Hot N Juicy special - 2 pounds of shrimp, hot, garlic butter - 1 pound of snow crab legs, hot, Hot N Juicy special  EVERYTHING was flavorful, tender, and juicy.  It was definitely more \"hot\" than I had expected, (I'm used to the \"hot\" here in DC) which wasn't a bad thing at all.  Although they messed up our order of shrimp (they gave us Hot N Juicy special instead of garlic butter) and the server was very unaccomodating towards the mistake, (She asked us: \"Are you sure that's the wrong one?\") repeatedly having to ask for things, (salt and pepper and limes, gloves, cleaning out our buckets, etc.) and spilling juices on my back while cleaning up -- everything else was smooth.  I could understand that it was really busy and serving a group of 9 might have been challenging, especially because we all had different drink orders and requests.  This is definitely a \"must-try\" if you're in Vegas and love seafood!",

The shrimp here didn't taste as fresh.  Maybe I came on a bad night?  The fried catfish was a disappointment as well.  Price:  Boiling Crab is a tad less expensive.  Not too much to make or break the deal.  Service:  Boiling Crab.  Our server was really friendly and attentive and funny.  Did I mention he was cute.  I may just come back for him. ;)  Hot n Juicy was friendly but our waitress seemed to be in a rush.  This was a Monday night.   Atmosphere:  Boiling crab was a lot bigger so I felt less Claustrophobic.    Alcohol:  This one goes to Hot n juicy.  They have a bigger selection on drinks.    Boiling Crab 4 - Hot N Juicy  1  3 stars.  Not terrible... But probably won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Its super cramped inside, but its expected because maximize capacity = more profit. If you're being seated next to a window, take off all top layers (i.e. coats and sweaters, NOT shirts and bras) because it WILL get hot.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp and a pound of crawfish, and I'm pretty sure the shrimp was not fresh. The shell was limpy and most of the heads were detached from the body. The crawfish was okay, as are the chicken wings and the fried shrimp, but the thing to try is the soft-shell crab and the Cajun fries- those two were unforgettable, especially the crab.  The staff here was pretty good, they checked in on us (genuinely checking in, as in how is the food and is there anything they can bring us) a few times and refilled our drinks often since fluids depleted rapidly to offset the spiciness of the the...spices.  With that being said this concept is ripped entirely from California's Boiling Crab, right down to the tables and chairs. BC is heaps better, with much more strategic interior organization and decorations, fresher seafood, and a more efficient staff. But hey, this is Vegas, so whatever opens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...right?",

So seeing as how Hot and Juicy is so popular and reviews say it's soooo \"amazing\", we decided to stop in before hitting the road to Cali. Their crawfish was $11.99 a lb, and nowhere on the menu did it state that the crawfish came frozen. If we knew I would've never ordered it. We ordered 10 lbs and although the sauces/seasonings were good, the meat was so tough. I was so upset when it came and the sticker on the bag said \"Frozen\". Took them forever to seat us, forever to take our Order and the waitresses all had attitude and were short. Im usually really passive and patient when eating out because I used to waitress and still work in the service industry, but for such a \"famous\" restaurant, our experience sucked. I gave them 3 stars because the crab and lobster was good and so was the seasoning. We had to walk up to ask for extra bowls and spoons and even our check AND TO PAY, you'd think seeing as how we were the biggest party and our tab was $300 they'd somewhat cater to our needs, nope.",

Awesome selection of seafood, sauce with a great spicy kick, and you get to attack your food with all the barbarity you can muster.  Since the four of us were starving, we ordered a portion of cajun fries, a portion of sweet potato fries, a dozen oysters and 4lbs of shrimp. Yeah, that's way too much food. The fries had good flavour but to me, they just took up unnecessary tummy space. The oysters were small and scrawny but still had a nice, fresh taste. The shrimp on the other hand, was impressive. They were big and filled us up fast. We went with the spicy Hot N Juicy sauce, and we were all feeling a little burning around our lips. Very satisfying.",

You get a bag of seafood drenched in whatever flavor sauce you want with your level of spicyness. I definitely recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood because it soaks in the flavor and juices and it tastes SO GOOD! Beware that the shrimp comes out with the heads still attached and you have to peel off the shells yourself. My friend wasn't warned and I think she was a little surprised hahah.   So I tried their crawfish and the shrimp in their signature Hot N Juicy sauce (which is a mix of all of the sauces) and it definitely satisfied my seafood cravings. I found it so much fun to eat with your hands like a kid. You get a plastic bid and by the end of the meal, my hands were completely messy hahah so much fun! However, the smell did stick around for awhile but the experience was worth it. Plus, the food came out SO FAST. Our order was ready in less than 10 mins! AWESOME!  We also got some sweet potato fries and cajun fries to share which was a nice side to have. So come prepared to be extremely messy and eat your weight in seafood!  Price wise: you pay by the pound. It ended up being around $10/lb for the shrimp and crawfish.",

    "text": "LOVED IT!  We asked our waitress to recommend a seasoning, since there were a few options. She recommended the lemon pepper, and I'm glad we followed her advice. We got both shrimp and crawfish, one with the hot 'n' juicy, and one with the lemon pepper.   The crawfish were incredible. The meat was sweet, with a bit of a floral fragrant aftertaste. I have a friend who swears by crawfish, but I didn't know why until now. We could also de-vein the crawfish just by tugging on the tail of the shell after breaking off the head. I had no idea that was possible, and call me odd but it added an element of fun to the experience. The shells were also thinner than I've previously experienced - I just wanted to crunch into them after carnally tearing off the heads. Talk about bringing out my inner beast.  They give you salt and pepper for dip, and also some lime/lemon. Tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. Then, load it with the salt and pepper. It gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease. That way, you can endlessly rotate between pungent and rich, and citrusy sweet.  The waitress also wrote \"Thank You\" on our receipt. A great, friendly touch. I'll be coming back here whenever I'm in Vegas.",

I ordered a pound of lemon pepper crawfish among other things and it did take a few minutes but when I received my order I had nothing to complain about. The restaurant is a bit chaotic and small but my girlfriend and I had a great server I believe her name was Lauren or Laura, which had us laughing and gave us great customer service.  Overall Boiling Crab has more flavors and seasonings but the customer service at Hot-n-Juicy is definitely superior and can't forget they have a great drink selection",

We got one pound of the crawfish and two and a half pounds of shrimp with two drinks and our bill was only $42.00.

So yeah, I dined at the supremely elegant Fleur de Lys, downed steak at the trendy N9NE Steakhouse, and ate my frites at Bouchon - but nothing was quite as satisfying as rolling up my sleeves, donning a bib, and digging into a bag full of hot and juicy crawfish.   After watching the Man vs. Food Vegas edition, we decided the trek off the strip was worth it for pounds upon pounds of seafood, all seasoned with the house signature, Hot and Juicy sauce.  This is interactive dining, not for the faint-hearted. We ordered several pounds of Hot and Juicy crawfish, Hot and Juicy shrimp, king crab legs, chicken nuggets, corn& potatoes and cajun fries. While extremely inexpensive and delicious, be prepared to get down and dirty. If you can dig your beer under the mounds of crawfish and shrimp shells, take a long swig because even the mild sauce had my senses in a frenzy.  Ask for extra paper towels. 3% off your bill if you opt to pay in cash. The wait can be long but at $3 a beer, the time will pass quickly.",

We ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish...all medium spiciness with garlic butter seasoning.  We should've ordered a pound with different seasoning and heat....to test our taste buds.  I'm eyeing the Hot n Juicy Special and Lemon Pepper seasonings for my next visit.  I think the garlic butter had more garlic than butter....extremely potent!    The crawfish was very spicy at medium...but we loved it.  Some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places I've gone to.  The shrimp was my favorite though.  Same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  We also ordered sausage, corn, and Cajun fries...which were all just okay for me.    Customer service was top notch here...I just wish they were open later than 10 pm.    We learned that the Man vs. Food show will be taping at this restaurant.  With their hot n juicy menu, it's evident why this place will be premiered.",

Ate king crab, shrimp, crawfish, sausage, chicken fingers, fries (regular and sweet potato), fried fish. All was delicious but the work you put into it seemed like a lot. Thought it was odd that a 1lb of shrimp or the experience meal were brought out in plastic bags and they don't give you plates but that's how they roll here. Waitress was nice but she just recited all the menu items to us. She also forgot to give us gloves per my request. They also were hoarding the cracker. We had to ask. How do you serve crab legs and don't provide cracker? We had 9 people and they only gave 1! We requested another and they mark the number of the table cloth. Apparently people steal the cracker or it gets wrapped up in all the shells and paper towels and accidentally thrown away. Overall good experience. If you're ok with getting messy and eating off the paper table cloth. It cost $1 for butter. I'm surprised they don't give you butter to dip the crab legs in.",

    "text": "Easily craving crawfish, especially since the Husband missed out the last two times I went.  Went last Sunday and the place is packed!  Dang, it's getting busy in there and it's only going to get busier!    Started off with two pounds of crawfish ($10.99/lb) of their Hot N Juicy Special seasoning with medium heat.  Easy to peel shells, juicy and flavorful crawfish, what's there not to love?  Inquired about the Dungeness crab, $17.99/lb.  They gave us a 1.7-pounder and it arrived whole in a bag.  Started off with the back legs and moved up to the claws.  The meat was sweet and the crab was fresh.  Deciding on how to move about the body, broke the head off and it was crab head heaven.  Loads and loads of crab fat/head etc. and so bad for our cholesterol!  But it was so good, really good.  We were scooping that stuff up and dipping it into the sauce.  Yum yum!   Finally moving onto the body, broke it in half and dug into the lump meat.  Really sweet meat and just good stuff.  Nice treat from having only crawfish.  They did a last call as we were chowing on the crab, which was fine for us at the time.  Come to today, a few hours earlier, the Husband looks at me and says \"I want to go back for more crawfish.\"  I realize that because we ordered only two pounds the other day, we just teased ourselves.  (We're used to two pounds each.)  Then my brother calls and asks for the address of this place.  Is he in town...no, this weekend he will be with his boys.  Uh, if you're gonna go, we'll probably want to go with you too so let us know...  Yeah, we like it that much.  Our cholesterol numbers aren't looking too good at this point.",

Anyway, the servers were very attentive, so if I have to compare again to BC, well... there's really no comparison as I've never received good service from BC.   On the two occasions that I've been here, I've never had to wait for a seat so that's always nice =)",

The biggest difference between hot n juicy and boiling crab is that boiling crab sauce is all grease and hot n juicy has very little grease but tons of flavor.  Service is always great too! I'm going there tomorrow! 2 pounds of shrimp please.",

I always get at least one pound of the fresh crawfish and a little of this and a little of that depending on who I'm with.  My last trip I did find a piece of metal (scrubbing sponge thingy) in my fried calamari. They took it off the check for me no problem.  Put a bib on because it gets a little messy with all the juicy deliciousness in the bag. Beware, you will smell like the things you order (plus garlic) for more than a little bit, but it's so tasty that it's all good with me!!!",

It's one thing to have spicy food, but when you have to put your hand into what amounts to a bag of soup to pull out the food, it's just too much.  I think those who chose crab legs and shrimp were happy, but the hot n juicy crawfish was a big disappointment.  Won't do this again and all in all, not what I would call a good experience.",

Tip: The food is very pungent and will seep into your clothes, and the whole eating process is super messy. I didn't even eat crawfish, but my mom was eating one and accidentally flung a piece to my ear! So, dress appropriately and prepare to get messy.",

I was a bit of a doubter at first since I came from Southern CA and was used to Boiling Crab (which has since made its way to the Las Vegas valley). I have yet to try the LV Boiling Crab, but I am a fan of Hot N Juicy. The sauce is a bit different than Boiling Crab, but has a lot of flavor and you can definitely enjoy it. My usual order consists of shrimp and Alaskan king crab legs in the Hot N Juicy special sauce (which is basically all the sauces combined together - extra garlic please!) at the spicy level. Note - extra spicy is really really hot, almost too hot to be enjoyable.   I have also had their lobster tails and other crabs. I'm not a huge fan of crawfish since its a lot of work for a little meat, but a lot of other people enjoy it here. Be prepared for a messy meal as this is a eat with your hands kind of place since you have to peel most everything. Its usually fun to see who can make the biggest pile of shells!  I've also had the deep fried soft shell crab with fries and the oysters - both are really good and the oysters were fresh.   This is definitely a place that I will frequent and also bring friends to from out of town. I will see how the new LV Boiling Crab compares, but for now, you can find me at Hot N Juicy!",

King crabs and snow crabs were were meaty and delicious, the shrimp was big, and the crawfish weren't bad, although they were my least favorite because they required a lot of work for very little meat. Corn and corn fritters were excellent. We had to get another order of the fritters because they were so good.  Even on a Sunday night it was busy. We came here after go-karting at Pole Position and worked up an appetite but had to wait over half an hour to get a table. And, what's up with the TV reception? They've got some big flat screens but the picture was all static-y. Not that I cared to watch TV during dinner, but it just seemed odd.  My hands still wreaked of garlic the day after, but it was so worth it.",

But I didn't give them 5 stars because if the CRAWFISH ARE FROZEN...STAY AWAY! The waitress did warn us...and they were $6.99/lb but my sister was in town for Thanksgiving, and I raved to her about this place. EEEE GADS! We got 5 lbs and they WERE MUSHY! I think my sister complained of a belly ache afterwards. Not me, I have a strong stomach for crawfish...ha ha...  We did get a couple pounds of the fresh blue crabs and they were heavenly and the meat sweet and tender!  Also, be prepared...IT's MESSY! Make sure you wear a bib. Thank goodness there are plenty of paper towels...I think I used up a whole roll...  I highly recommend this place, as long as the crawfish and seafood are fresh!

It surprises me how fresh the crawfish are! I heard they fly them in daily. YUM =)   The oysters are also really good. The cajun fries are ok. I think the boiling crab ones is way better but what matters most, is the sauce for the seafood (which is delicious!)  My boyfriend left his credit card here and we were able to come back and retrieve it.

The is the place where table manner and dress code is optional. By the time you are done, it will be messy with sauce all over your face your hand and piles of seafood on the table. So don't dress to impress, just bring something to cover yourself. :D Their ordering process is simple: Just order the choice of seafood, seasoning, level of spicy and add-ons. The Hot N Juicy special seasoning is absolutely fabulous. It's like a combination of  Cajun, black pepper and lots of garlic, so you got lots of flavor in one bag. The spice level is more like those you will find in a Thai restaurants, so when you pick spicy, it is really spicy. Make sure you order POTATOES as add-ons, it well pick up all the sauces and juices in the bag and you will be in potato heaven.  We ordered 2lbs crawfish, 0.5lbs shrimp, extra corn and potato in Hot N Juicy special seasoning and spicy. With two drinks it only cost us about 26 dollars. So it not only the best taste you will find in Vegas it will also be the best value in Vegas.",

We also ordered 1/2 dozen of the sausage $2.50 and a bowl of Etouffee soup $6.79. The Etouffee soup is like a gumbo soup, but with seafood in it. Taste super good and MUST TRY! The shrimps and the sausage came in one plastic bag. The shrimps were yummy and juicy, but not spicy at all because we ordered it in mild. Next time we would try medium. The sausage wasn't very special, so we will skip it next time.   The service was great. The waiters were very polite and attentive. They refilled our soda three times. I like the plastic bib that they passed out because you will need it if you don't want to get stains on your shirt. It's a great experience. I highly recommend it!",

We were on vacation in Vegas for a week and we ended up coming here for dinner twice (on our first night there as well as our third).  The wait can be a little long, but totally worth the wait. Living in Hawai'i we have a huge assortment of seafood, but it's pricey. When we saw how much it cost for a pound of king crab legs, we were kind of surprised because it's cheaper, and I'd say, reasonable.   If you're not into getting your fingernails dirty, then this might not be the place for you, although they do provide you with gloves and a whole roll of paper towels to clean yourself up. Aside from that, I'd give this place 5 stars because I had an awesome experience, both times.",

There are so many different flavors and spice levels so anyone can enjoy some fresh seafood. The shrimp, craw-fish, etc are first cooked in a seasoning and then put into a plastic bag with ANOTHER flavor, a red potato, and a corn cob and tied up to steam as it it brought out to your table.  You sit at the table with a plastic bib and a large plastic table cloth and an endless supply of wet naps and swim in the juicy goodness that they have brought you.  They also have a small selection of cold beers to wash it all down with.  So come on down and enjoy so  piece of Thai/Creole goodness mixed together ;D",

I definitely recommend getting the shrimp since it has more \"meat\" for the pound rather than all shell but if you're willing to spend the extra bucks for the other shelled fish. Why not? Any seasoning you get has so much flavor. Definitely get the \"Hot n Juicy\" flavor even without spice it's good. Lemon Pepper & Garlic Butter is delicious too. They also offer delicious calamari.  I'll definitely be back here over and over again.",

    "text": "Yay! I finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  It took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  I could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  He was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  He's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!  So I went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  I was excited because I've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  Between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of snow crab legs (both hot n juicy special, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.    I zeroed in on the seafood, I didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  My mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  But she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  Everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, I'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  I don't even remember how many paper towels I personally went through but I'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.  I think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  I just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  But my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!  I'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  Baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness I fed her.  Now that I know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby I think I've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  He's also a sucker for anywhere that serves sweet potato fries. :o)",

A few differences from the research (now that translates to food eating) I have done  1) some places charge $.25 a glass for water 2) some locations have buy one beer, get the other free (that rocks!) 3) some places offer disposable gloves for your messy shelling fest 4) some places offer 3% discount off your bill if you pay in cash 5) all places have a signature mix, but don't be fooled...The tastes aren't duplicated! 6) One place is on the Man Vs. Food tour  Hmmm, wonder which place that is....Hot N Juicy offers selections 3-6 of the above list!  The shrimp are plump and yes, JUICY. The corn is sweet and succulent.  Come early to avoid long lines.  We got there around 5:30 pm and were seated right away  Service is attentive and swift.  Parking was kinda hard when we got there, so I can imagine it must be a madhouse when the place gets packed",

For some reason it tasted different than it usually does, with a faint, bitter aftertaste and not the usual, \"smack you in the face\" garlic punch.   It took a little while to realize that they had substituted the fresh garlic for the cheap bottled chopped garlic stuff that barely resembles garlic!!!! It was totally depressing that a restaurant that seems to be busy from the moment they open to the moment they close would need the sacrifice that distinct garlicky goodness for a bitter sulfur flavored imitation.....  I hope they wise up and switch back soon!",

Don't get me wrong their flavors are all there! You have to try the hot and juicy seasoning which is a mixture of everything.   When they mean spicy they really mean it! The have other items on the menu for those who do not eat seafood like chicken wings and chicken nuggets.   Service is okay, a few times they forgot my order and never checked up on us to see why we haven't all received our food. Not only that they never even apologized.

I actually came to this place randomly with my girlfriend when we were in Las Vegas and she was craving crawfish. We came here before we knew it was on the show and we had no idea what to expect.  We came on a saturday afternoon and the place was completely empty. We were the only customers in the building... For a saturday afternoon i didnt see that as being a good sign. We ordered a pound of Crawfish, cajun fries and i ordered myself some deep fried shrimp.  I was not a fan of the crawfish, but most notably the sauce. We got mild or medium and it just wasnt very good. The fried shrimp was over battered and the shrimp did not taste fresh at all. i ended up not finishing the shrimp, and i ate fries most of the time i was there. My girlfriend finished the crawfish, didnt like it very much. We left and both agreed that we probably wont be back to this location again.  We were definitely comparing this place to Boiling Crab and nothing really compares to boiling crab.  The positives. The service was pretty good and friendly :)",

The \"hot and juicy\" sauce is disgusting. It's ok (thought kinda overwhelming) going down and horrendous when you're REEKING of it for two days after. That's NOT how Louisianians eat their crawfish.   The only reason this place didn't get a 1 is because of the peel-and-eat shrimp. They were fantastic and reasonably priced.  If I ever go back, I know not to expect much for the service, order two drinks from the beginning, ditch the sauce and get only shrimp.",

I ordered 4 pounds of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, and dozen oysters. The only complaint was that the oysters were some of the smallest I have seen recently. There are a few sauce options when ordering the crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and crab. I ordered mild with everything mixed together. It was really good. I love crawfish and sometime if they are not cooked right its difficult to peel and these were not they were perfect.

I feel this place is slightly over-hyped and perhaps part of my let down was attributed to such high expectations due to this hype. I expected to be blown away, and instead I was just barely satisfied.   We ordered 1lb of shrimp in their signature sauce medium spicy, half a dozen oysters, cajun fries and bowl of rice. I also had two beers. The tab was very reasonable for the amount of food we received, hence why I opted for four instead of three star rating. I felt that the price was fair for the quality of the food. The sauce was good as was the shrimp. The fries were nothing special, but the cajun seasoning was very very good. The oysters were tiny and not memorable. The rice was great with the sauce from the shrimp. Overall, the meal was fine but I would not seek this place out again or feel the desire to return unless the circumstance calls for it (friends who want to try it, I am in the area and rest of Chinatown has burned down, etc).",

The shrimp may not be plump anymore but mushy, mushy as in maybe not fresh but aging quite a bit? At any rate, I no longer crave their shrimps after coming here for years. May have to even eat the ones at Boiling Crab. It seems once they expanded to 3 locations they just started sucking. Service is still good but the shrimp is no longer special. Even the secret sauce is. It that great anymore. Where's that strong garlic taste from when you order garlic spice???",

My family decided to order to go since there was about 20 of us total and we didn't want to go to the restaurant. My aunt ordered about 200$ worth of shrimp/crawfish. When she got home I was ready! But to my dismay, the food was HORRIBLE. The shrimp was NOT fresh at all and fell apart when we peeled the skin off. It was like eating powder... the crawfish, I already knew that they weren't fresh and were frozen. But they were even better than the shrimp. I don't know what happened. It felt so surreal, I've been to Hot n Juicy on several occasions before and I was very pleased. The shrimp were always plump and juicy. The crawfish was good as well. The only thing that's good about this place is that the sauce was good.  I'm almost embarrassed to write this update because I told so many friends/family about this place. It was most of my family's first time experiencing cajun seafood and they were all dissatisfied. They didn't understand why I liked it so much. We had over half of our order left over. What a waste of money.",

Also tried the fried calamari appetizer and it was awesome  Even if you are staying on the Las Vegas strip go a little out of your way to try this restaurant. It's about a 15 minute bus ride so don't waste your money on a taxi as you will be spending some $$ on their menu which is a bit pricey",

Unfortunately, they only have a 4 star rating but as far as food ratings then it deserves the maximum 5 stars. The customer service is the reason they can't reach that. We've been coming here for years. We usually always come to the original location. They have one on South Eastern and their other two locations are on Spring Mountain. They have opened multiple locations out of state as well. Back when they took pictures of you with their Polaroid camera and stuck your photo on the wall.   For most people it's either hot and juicy or boiling crab.   Hot n Juicy!!!   1)If it's your first time here becareful with the level of spiciness because your toilet might hold you hostage by making you pay   2)You have to try the hot n juicy special which is a mix of all their flavored   3) Ask for gloves   4) Be prepared to smell like the restaurant for the rest of your day  5) An odd tip, but use lemons to wipe your hands down with; it helps with the smell   6) Their shrimp makes the best leftover mini sandwiches for the win   7) Crab legs are my favorite thing to order.   8) n corn  9) n Cajun fries  10) n lemon juice",

I was not happy with the hostess when I came in to eat for the first time because we waited for so long and they sat a big party of 6 and a 5 top before me and my friend.. I understand that they had to give away big tables first but we have been waiting for so long.. the crawfish seems to always run out so they only have frozen ones.. and for how much we paid, it was just not worth it.",

    "text": "I love Hot N Juicy. I found out about this place from foodnetwork? or travel channel's mvf? not really sure.   The 1st time I've ever tried to eat crawfish was here. We ordered 1 lb of crawfish in medium hot&juicy sauce. After trying crawfish I learned that it's too much work for not enough meat, so never again. The hot&juicy sauce was delicious and pretty spicy. I love spicy food, but not so spicy that all you get is heat and no flavor.   I prefer to order the 1 lb of shrimp with 1 dozen sausage in mild hot&juicy sauce. With a side of cajun fries. This is a winner for sure. This entire meal would cost around $30 and good for 2 people. Hot&Juicy sauce in mild has a good balance of heat and flavor. I love to let my cajun fries swim in that sauce. The h&j sauce also has the best flavor out of the other flavor options they offer. Beware tho cause the garlic and butter in the sauce will make you smell all day. By the end of the day you can still sort of smell the sauce on your fingers.   I've also tried their raw oysters and you get 1 dozen for $15. It was good but the oysters are kind of small so I wouldn't really recommend it.  The calamari is ok. Cooked well. I tried dipping it into the hot&juicy sauce just because i love the sauce so much. Unfortunately it tasted too salty. The calamari is good on its own.   I'm from the Bay Area so I've tried Crawdaddy's and this is way better than Crawdaddy's. Crawdaddy's sauce is watered down compared to Hot N Juicy. Crawdaddy's shrimp also looks anemic compared to Hot N Juicy. I haven't tried Boiling Crab tho.",

The people I went with don't eat very spicy food, so the waiter dude recommended mild heat which was still good.  We had crawdads, shrimp, and clams, and crab legs.  Decent service, eye-candy patrons, TV's and beers on tap.  I will come back!  That ish is VEGAS, son!   BTW, to all you whiners that complain about waiting an hour to eat, TOO BAD! We got lucky and seated 7 right away by calling ahead and checking first before making the effort to go there.",

    "text": "I find it only fair to mention that I hail from the south and have had the best in boiled crawfish most of my life. I thought I would be getting the same quality since the owners are from Houston. Crawfish is not on par with anything from Houston or any part of Louisiana but since there are no alternatives in Vegas, I would have to say it's the best crawfish place (and I think the only one) in town. It is listed on The Best of Las Vegas but I've found that list to be a disappointment.   I was disappointed that they charge extra for red potatoes and corn on the cob. All the other patrons seem to always be amazed at seeing crawfish and that we know how to peel them and suck the heads. This just adds to my impression that people are easily impressed and amused here. Prices are moderate but I still don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth due to the portion size.   Crawfish is not really fresh due to the fact that we're in the Mohave Desert. I guess I just have a higher standard having had Crawfish in New Orleans and all over Louisiana countless times. Everyone else raves about this place I suppose because they have nothing to compare it to. I'm sure I'll be back when I have another crawfish jones but I just feel they could do better.   It's always blazing hot in the restaurant no matter what time of day I've been in there. I guess they are trying to save money?   Don't have enough bathrooms.",

    "text": "Vegas's answer to Boiling Crab...only more low key  I love cajun seafood spots because they're so low maintenance.  I don't have to worry about using the right fork with the right dish.  Actually, I don't even need utensils.  Awesome!  This is precisely the reason I went here on a (hot)  Sunday afternoon with the boyfriend, hoping it would be a nice afternoon date spot.  I was right.  The place wasn't too packed, or noisy, and surprisingly, we were seated immediately.    In terms of the food, as many of the California kids on here had mentioned, the menu is a lot like Boiling Crab.  In lieu of the Whole Shabang, you can get the Hot n' Juicy special, which is a combination of different spices.  We got that Hot n' Juicy special seasoning with 2 lbs of crawfish, boiled shrimp, a basket of fried shrimp and fries, and an order of oysters.   If you order  a 2 lb bag, they throw in a whole potato and cob of corn, both of which taste delicious after having been marinating in that cajun seasoning.  We ordered everything as Medium spicy, which the waitress had warned us as being very hot for most people.  I didn't think it was unbearably spicy.  It was just right!  However, If you're sensitive to spicy foods, you might want to go down a notch.  Not to mention,  they also have a good selection of cheap beers to go with that Hot n' Juicy special.  Great local spot away from the craziness of the Las Vegas strip.  I'll be coming back!",

They put so little per bag now, I can't even dip my shrimp back in.        - Prices - Their \"Market Prices\" are still a dollar or two above Boiling Crabs.        - Crawfish - Their crawfish are smaller and less fresh than Boiling Crab's crawfish.        - Conversion - Eventually, all of their patrons will wise up to the other \"crawfish/shrimp in a bag\" place in town and it'll be too late for them to turn it around. I used to favor Hot & Juicy over Boiling Crab, but not anymore. **Recommendations**        - I want to give this place a 3.5, so I'll round it up to 4. It's still good, but just a shell compared to it's former self. Unless Boiling Crab has too long of a wait, I'll probably not be coming to Hot & Juicy anymore.",

    "text": "This is my first time trying Hot N Juicy Crawfish and I have to agree with the other Yelpers when they say that the crawfish yield is not worth it.  My homegirls from NYC came to visit and I suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  So here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - garlic butter sauce, cajun fries and 3 corn on the cob.  The shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  It'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.    The dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  It was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  We had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  Getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  I go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat crab legs all night long!  Anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  It was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound dungeness crabs, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. LoL   Anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  We enjoyed our food.  We would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  Must get the dungeness crab if you are willing to spend the money.  Total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  I will definitely go back there with more out of town friends.",

I was a little thrown off at first, because there's a disposable tablecloth right in front of you and they throw down a plastic bag of crawfish/shrimp/whatever, laden with sauce and a corn/potato/whatever thrown inside. And you just kind of dig in! Crawfish itself is kind of hard to eat, or difficult, since you go through sooo much work and the result doesn't really yield much. I'm much more of a shrimp kinda girl, but the sauce and all that licking made it worthwhile.   This place is great, would come back again. My only complaint is (that since I'm such an environmentalist) they throw EVERYTHING away, from cups to plates to forks. I mean, i get it, it's easy clean up and all. But the poor environment!

    "text": "This place is not for everyone, but if you can handle ripping apart shellfish with your bare hands, you are in for an amazing treat.  I'm hesitant on such things myself, but once I managed to get past that, and get the meat out of the crawfish and muss it around in the amazing sauce, I was hooked.  The experience: it's a simple clean place.  You order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (I go with the hot & juicy special), and tell them what else you want thrown in... potatoes, corn, sausage (I recommend all three).  A few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  No plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  You're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  Make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.  I recommend washing it down with an ice cold Blue Moon.  They do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great chicken wings, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.  But then you're kind of missing out on what makes it special.  I should mention that unless you like pain, you should order \"medium\".  Their \"spicy\" is truly hot, and not some watered down notion of \"spicy\".  My Korean relatives agree.  Their \"extra spicy\" is reserved only for the completely fearless.  Also, I recently have tried the Snow Crab -- very tasty and satisfying, with larger chunks of meat than you can get from a crawfish.  Good eating!  Again, if you're squeemish about this kind of thing, it might not be the place for you.  Also unlikely to go over well on a first date with it's enormous garlic content.  But it is unquestionably super delicious, and if you think you can handle it, you should definitely give it a shot.",

I must say I was far from disappointed.  The service was great and they were on top of things.  I tend to consume a lot of liquids when i eat so it's nice to have prompt service and refills without having to ask.  Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu and its options.  I love the variety of food and flavors.  We had the crawfish (hot n juicy style) and clams (garlic butter).  The flavors were amazing! But do be aware I was burping and tasting garlic for several hours later.  My only negative comment on the place would be their heat scale.  I got the clams less than mild and they were more like hot.  They did inform us that the heat scale was hotter than average and at times I do love something scorching.  But this time I was looking more for abundance of flavor instead of just hot.  Made it more difficult to discern flavors.  other than that we had a great experience and will come back again.",

    "text": "holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i KNOW eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!  *NOTE this is the same review for their new restaurant.   the only difference is layout.   the service, price, and quality of food does not diminish from one place to the other.  TIME SPENT once a week @ Lunch/Dinner times.  LAYOUT HJnC seems to be a chain and, for Vegas, this location is the older of the two found in Chinatown.   unlike their newest store, this location has more of a \"dive-in\" look.   it's an open space look with squared tables and 2/3 half moon shaped booth seating towards the back.     i've stopped coming to this location ever since the new one opened, but i recall the VERY long lines to get in.   they have a couple of seats to help with the waiting inside, but those fill up quick, and so it leads to many customers sitting around randomly (sp.?) outside.  also note that ths location has LIMITED parking.!   customers tend to park around a adjacent neighborhood or at the shopping center over (tow warning).  this issue may be gone with the new store opening...   but, garunteed - HJnC is always crowded nonetheles.^^  SERVICE no matter which HnJC you're at, the service is OUTSTANDING.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but EVERYONE who works there will also eventually ask what you need.  FOOD there's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;  my one CON is the Snow Crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ Rio's World Buffet as a local).  i have ALOT of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-potato fries, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^  PRICING on average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.  CLOSING HnJC will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of Suicide Girls were waitressing the establishment.!  TIPS 1.  SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry. 2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid. 3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc.",

I like spicy foods so of course I had to get it spicy. Overall not bad, I've had better for a cheaper price but in Vegas you can't go wrong with Hot N Juicy for your crawfish fix. Did not try anything else other than the cajon fries which were pretty good also...  I believe the price is about $10/lb of crawfish, you have to order at least two lbs in order to get the corn and potato which I found odd because I have been to places that gives you corn and sausages with your order. Anyhow you have to give this place a try, just don't go here for dinner if you have plans on going out because you will smell like HOT n Juicy Crawfish when you leave haha.  Enjoy",

    "text": "I agree with Marilou A. (the reviewer before me). Similar experience. I'm from S. Cali and love crawfish. We went to Hot & Juicy bc one of our friend saw it on Food Network. (*Side note: It was on \"Man vs Food\" and obviously the host has never been to Boiling Crab in S. Cali.)  Anyways, so when we went they told us they only had frozen crawfish. We figured we had frozen crawfish before ... if the sauce is good, everything will be ok. NOTHING WAS GOOD. 1) The crawfish was crumbly. I expected some toughness or flakiness from it being frozen, but this was just nasty. A bunch must have been dead before they were frozen.  2) The sauce was NOT JUICY. It did not make me want to lick my fingers or suck the crawfish head. Too salty and pungent. 3) The corn was either overcooked or it was bad frozen corn. The kernels were tiny and prune-like.   The only think I liked about the place was the fried chicken wings. Those were definitely HOT & JUICY, but I didn't go there for crawfish. I wanted dang good crawfish. We felt so cheated out  of the experience, so when we went home 2 days later, we dropped by Boiling Crab to cleanse our taste bud of not Hot & Juicy.   WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.",

This was not only a great place to grab some food, but reasonably priced with very friendly servers and a fun experience. Just make sure you don't have any paper cuts because you will be using your hands! And if you get some of the spicy seasoning, then beware!  They do provide you with a bib, which I needed. Actually, I needed two since I ripped the first one and it became unusable. Fail on my part. Coupled with the plastic on the table and the paper towels, you do not wear your Sunday best here, unless you'd like it covered in their delicious sauces.  I had the shrimp, calamari, and a bowl of rice. Wanted to try the crawfish but I had a craving for shrimp. Maybe next time, I come to Vegas often!",

We ended up at Hot N Juicy. We were seated soon. But as we sat there, the dinner rush hour started to near and the line has gotten long. There was even a waiting list. We ordered 2 lb of crawfish with extra corn and lobster.  The crawfish was good. But it was alot of work for such little meat. The lobster was a little more expensive but it was so worth it. There was so much meat, we didn't have to spend too much time getting to the succulent meat. The dinner rolls came to us warm. Too bad it took 2 bites and it was gone.  Even though it was good, but being spoiled by my regular spot in Portland, Oregon, I really can't say it's THAT good as My Brother's Crawfish.",

I'd highly recommend the lemon pepper sauce with the shrimp and getting crab legs with their famous hot and juicy sauce! Though I'd like to think I like spicy foods it turns out the mild on both of these is spicy enough for me ! Lots of kick in the best sense! Me and my boyfriend usually get a pound or pound and a half of shrimp and a pound of crab legs but when we are really going big we do two pounds of crab legs! A little pricey but so worth it and such a fun date place I love picking everything apart for the meat and getting messy and licking sauce of my fingers it's a great time",

Parking can suck as the lot gets crowded but there is parking on the street with no sidewalk.  That works I guess.    Lucky for me I had a huge paper cut on my thumb so I was praying they had gloves and they did. Whew.  My fiance got the crawfish medium and I got the shrimp spicy.  They come and bags, you rip the bag open and then go at it.  It's super hot and the gloves actually helped.  I think you get the best bang for your buck with the shrimp, as the crawfish is all shell.  The crawfish heads are delicious though, smoky woodsy flavor.  However, the shrimp are the way to go, easier eating, more substance, similar flavors.  My glove did get punctured and that spicy sauce going into my paper cut was a great feeling, but not as bad as sauce going into my eye when I accidentally scratched my eye.  Comedy of errors.    We stopped here on our last two visits to Vegas and think we will continue to do so.  Haven't found a place in LA that competes yet.",

Our trip was planned around where we would be eating the entire time.  That's how we roll.  We came here on a Friday night and luckily got seated right away.  We had heard of long long wait times so we planned on coming earlier than later.    Once seated, we looked at the menu and ordered up our meal.  4lbs of Hot and Juicy crawfish for my sister and me, oysters for me and the hubs and he and my brother in law ordered shrimp.  Although the service was slow, the food was not.  They were brought to us in plastic bags all steaming and full of flavor.  The crawfish were ah-mazing.  They were so hot to the touch that I didn't care if my tongue got burnt. I could not get enough of them.  The seasoning was addicting and wanted to have it on everything.  The boys were done eating before sis and I even really got started.  We can put a lot back.  Come here.  Don't walk. Run.  Or drive since its off the strip.  You will thank me.  But just a warning, your clothes will smell like the food.  It's that potent.",

A few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. OMG, I fell head over heels in love!   It's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. There was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! We decided to grab a bottle of wine (Fetzer Riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. I was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. LOL  It was Friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). Wheee! :-D I remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! I also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided I wanted to sit in his section. I let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. All of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.  Finally, the food. You select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. We opted for the Hot N Juicy Special (combo of Louisiana style, cajun, garlic butter, & lemon pepper), Extra Spicy (Hot Hot Hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). The crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & potatoes to your order as needed. All of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! Everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! It was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. The service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! It was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. I think I ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. Silly me! LMAO   We ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & potatoes to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. Those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) I was back in Vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on Sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! Looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.  Be sure to check this place out next time you're in town. You're sure to love it as much as I do! :-D",

We had to wait a good 30-45 minutes before we were actually seated.  Staff awesome and helpful.

We also ordered crawfish and shrimp in their garlic butter sauce.  So good!!!!  My brother in law said that this place was way better than Boiling Crab and had better prices too!    They had really delicious Cajun fries and their catfish and chicken wings are very tasty goodie too!

    "text": "Visited this unique dining establishment about a week ago not knowing what to expect but heard and read good reviews.  Our server, Emeli, was fantastic and went well beyond the call of duty not only to take fantastic care of us, but also took the time to explain what to expect and was full of useful information on ever aspect of the menu.  Hot & Juicy should be proud to have her a member of their team!  I should mention that I have grown up in and around the ocean and I'm very familiar with seafood in every respect.  The concept of this restaurant is that the patrons are delivered the food in plastic bags, to tables that are covered with disposable table cloths.  Each diner is provided a bib and surgical gloves( for those that don't want to get their hands dirty) and each table has a roll of paper towels. If you require a shower when you're done dining is up to you.  We found the food exceptionally fresh and tasty.  There were only two of us and we ordered several items.  Shrimp, Muscles and a Dungeness Crab.  Shrimps are severed with the heads on and not cleaned.  When you eat shrimp, you need to clean and devein them.  Peeling Shrimp are quite simple but deveining them with wet hands at the table is quite impossible.   This is no way to eat shrimp and I'm sure the owners of Fresh & Juicy know this. It's obviously much more economical for the restaurant not to clean, de-head and devein the shrimp and have the customer do it.  I'm not sure if most of their customers know to do this and can remove the vein. Again, almost impossible with wet hands and no implements.  The bill for two people ............................ We had one pound of shrimp, one pound of muscles and one Dungeness Crab, and a total of four domestic beers........$92 without a 23% tip. (Again, Emeli was fantastic) We were instructed to just put all of the shells directly on the table. As dining progressed, the table looked more and more like the pigs were feeding! Sorry, but this is not my \"thing\".   I don't mind paying $92 price for fresh seafood but I personally don't enjoy dining like a pig with plastic table cloths, crab shells and shrimp shells and head,  a roll of paper towels, in an atmosphere that is more in line with a fast food establishment.  I might have a different attitude if the bill was $40 but I know this is not possible for good seafood.    The bottom line is if you want to enjoy fresh, tasty seafood, eat it like a pig and are not price sensitive, this is your place for seafood.  I know it's not a place for me.  Try it for yourself and either way, at least you can form your own opinion.  I would have given this restaurant four stars for quality, freshness and taste and now you now know the rest.",

    "text": "When I hear the term 'hot and juicy', crawfish is the last thing that comes to my mind so when I heard about a restaurant called \"Hot and Juicy Crawfish\", I had to check it out. I had heard that it was casual, not too expensive for seafood and had an interesting approach to service. We went there Monday night for dinner with our boy, Sean, who was visiting from So. Cal. We found the restaurant on the sleazy edge of Chinatown in a small strip center next to a Chinese massage parlor and a karaoke bar. Didn't look to special on the outside but even out in the parking lot, we could smell the garlic in the air.  We went in and it was equally unimpressive inside but we were greeted pleasantly and seated quickly by the window under the neon light....ah, ambiance. The table was covered with a thin plastic tablecloth and contained only a roll of paper towels. The slender menu listed a variety of shellfish, crab, shrimp and, of course, crayfish, all of which are ordered by the pound. Side orders were limited and included mostly corn on the cob, rice and french fries or potato. We ordered the crayfish with Cajun sauce, shrimp with lemon-pepper sauce and blue crab with the garlic sauce. You can order any sauce from mild to paralyzing spicy. We went with mild which turned out to be pretty spicy on its own accord.  The food comes out piping hot, almost too hot to touch; dropped unceremoniously on the table all tied up in a plastic bags with all that sauce. You open the bag and dig in with your hands...no tableware of any kind except for a cracker for the crab.  As to the quality of the food...delicious...hot and juicy. All the sauces were fabulous. The crayfish is something we'd not order again, although it was fun to eat. You have to be a real 'crayfishianado' to suck the juice out of the heads like some do (we won't). So that leaves you with the tail which contains about a  \" piece of meat that took more work than it was worth to get to. The shrimp (head, shell and tail intact) were fabulous. Twist the head off, peel the shell and eat to your hearts content. We also tried a fried dish...breaded soft shell crab which was served with french fries...also delicious.  If you are looking to take people out to an impressive 'Vegas-style' food event, this is definitely not your place. But, if you want an inexpensive place with wonderful seafood, and don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, then I highly recommend it. It would be a blast to go to with friends who are laid-back and have a good sense of humor.",

    "text": "Oh em gee. I come here on average at least once a month. I wanna say it's their seasoning that gets me to come back everytime but I can't tell. When I went, crawfish was around $10 a pound and shrimp was a little less. I typically get shrimp because they have more meat and it is easier to get full. Crawfish meat is quite tiny once you peel the gigantic shell. If you buy 2lbs of crawfish, you automatically get a free corn and potato. Awesome!!! Get the hot n juicy special seasonsing which is basically a combination of all the other seasonings. I'm usually content with mild and medium spicyness level but my mother in law  get extra extra spicy and lemme tell ya... that kills you.   If you're lucky, you can catch them when they have etouffee (kind of like gumbo). Delish! Has pieces of crawfish, red bell pepper, celery.. etc. The flavor tastes similar to the hot n juicy special but I'm not sure.   Surprisingly, they have one of the bessstttt chicken wings anywhere. It comes out hot and fresh. The skin is super crispy and the inside is hot and juicy. Comes with ranch and ketchup and fries if you wish. A must have if you come!!!   Pros: CHICKEN WINGS & FRIES!!! Hot n Juicy Special seasoning  Cons: none really. Could be cheaper but business is business. =P",

A mix of all the flavors and spicy is not a good look. The flavor becomes confusing essentially cancelling each other out. I enjoy spicy food but the individual flavors (Cajun, garlic, etc...) medium spicy is best here. None spicy is best for older folks and children. The spiciness affected my digestion.  Bring plastic gloves because the sauces are wet can linger on your finger.",

I'm a shame... but I finally decided that I'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha  I love shrimp! Get the Hot n juicy special!! It's a mix of all their seasonings (juicy cajun, lemon pepper and garlic butter) and its soooo yummy!! I am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested I try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! My bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited.... We all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the crawfishes for my  friends.  My friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. They are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that BC doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). They also got the fried catfish basket. The catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal.   I got the soft shell crab basket on top of my shrimp and that was really good. The cajun fries that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover Hot n Juicy sauce that I had. Hehehe  All in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? I don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes.   We'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays.",

As far as the food goes, if you love messy finger food that comes equipped with a bib, you'll love Hot and Juicy. Their spice is not for the faint of heart! Even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. So far I've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. You have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience.   Don't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.   Keep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.  For those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.  Oh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, WEAR THE GLOVES!",

    "text": "I came here two years ago when on leave from Iraq.  Loved it.  And then after I came back from Iraq I was pleasantly surprised to see Man vs. Food come and eat here!  Good for them (both the show and the restaurant!).    Coming for CES I wanted to come back here.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Had to wait 30 minutes.    When they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  They told me because of the new opening of a 2nd Hot 'N Juicy in Washington (D.C. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  Sure, why not?  So I ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.    Got the Hot 'N Juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  You get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  So I did this and asked for extra garlic.  And I emphasized a lot of garlic.  And I chose medium as to how spicy.  I remember the 1st time I went I ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  So I decided on medium this time.  The tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  You get a bib to eat all your food with also.  The food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  While eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  After you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  A brand new clean table is ready.  I thought this was so cool the 1st time I came here so I made a complete mess of myself and the table.  Food came out and I started to chow down.  There was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  They forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag I asked for my bib.  One of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  I laughed as she tied it for me!  That's service!  Food was even better than I last remembered.  Shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  Choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  And of course the crawdad was excellent.  After 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  Will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, I'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like I use to.  So overall Hot 'N Juicy actually improved since I last came here-amazing.  A definite have to visit if you love crawdad.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were craving Boiling Crab (BC) while we were in Vegas visiting his parents. So we yelped for the new Boiling Crab in Vegas, but stumbled across Hot N Juicy Crawfish so we decided to give it a try. GOOD CHOICE!! I am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! There doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because I hate waiting for more than an hour for food.   Service is really good here. Our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. And when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. The waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is.   I think prices were a dollar more than BC but that's okay. Totally worth it. We usually order just 2lb of shrimp (I can't even eat half) and cajun fries to share. And we got the medium spicy hot n juicy special.   The shrimp: It's so good. It's better than the shrimp at BC because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! Sometimes at BC it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. But here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump shrimps. I think that is a win.  The cajun fries: Hot spicy goodness in the mouth. I felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! I love spicy food so this was a win in my book. It doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to make a stop here. It's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of Vegas.",

He was on the ball and his support team/other staff were awesome.  Drinks - Soda, Beer and wine...Sapporo $3, can't beat an ice cold Japanese beer.  Ambiance/Tableware - No knifes and forks, all you get is paper towels, a bib and unlimited wipes at the end of the meal. Decor is rustic, plenty of flat screens, great little bar area, just good clean (messy)  fun.  Don't let plastic bag serving vessels put you off and make as much mess as you want to!  Food - Pound of Lemon Pepper, mildly spiced and just friggin off the charts. Super succulent and delicious.  Pound of Hot n Juicy flavored, mildly spiced with corn and a few red potatoes. Great flavor, really really juicy and plump. Getting two pounds the next time!!! Corn and potatoes perfect.  Pound of mild, garlic butter King Crab...OMG to die for. Nothing really needs to be said just get them and lots of them!  Bill was $63 for soda, 3 beers and all that food (King Crab was most expensive at $24 per pound), you just won't find a better deal or a better way to spend some time getting covered, literally, in flavor and eating GREAT food.  Thanks Tim, we will be back!  PS. They have a location closer to the strip but according to Tim this location is the original, smaller and has a more homey felling to it. The owner is expanding the chain but not franchising. Nice to hear.",

    "text": "My very first time I went was with the same person I always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so I might as well introduce you to my friend Mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. Anyway, it was both our first time & I have never tried crawfish before.  We ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of juicy cajun crawfish, the soft shell crab basket w cajun fries, and calamari. I felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, I splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? The flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. My nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but I enjoyed it. I think next time I'll stick with crab legs cause I definitely have that down to a science ;) The cajun fries were straaight up cajun! I'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. Soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) The calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. There's only a few places where I can say that's GREAT calamari.   The service was average, it was a Sunday & the Lakers were playing Orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. I didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & I was washing my hands before & after we ate. My bad fellerz!  The weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. I don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? They already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so I don't really think they're going green anyway. Blah, maybe I'm going crazy because I'm yelping & it's already 6am!! Random.. and awkward receipt though. I will be back Hot N Juicy! The simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. I'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~",

I give three stars because the service was that bad. 1)Our waitress had the nerve to snap at my nephew because he was playing with the menus 2) She repeatedly forgot things we ordered 3) The second reason might be because when we were giving her our order she wasn't paying attention to us. They had a shift change later on and the new waitress was ten times better we wished we would've had her from the beginning. I will return but, for damn sure won't sit at a table she is servicing.",

Crawfish are seasonall as we all know and the seasons in full swing now for a few months ... being from Texas and being in the crawfish catering biz for 20 pluss years I know what I'm talking about .live field run shipped to Mccarran is 2.25... 2.75 a lb delivered in bulk , yet h/j is charging 15.00 per lb ... Urban crawfish, Lola's  and The boiling crab are competitors and DO not overcharge their customers ... the crawfish are Asain style and just as good if not better .... I rarely if ever write a bad review anywhere but this is a huge disservice to H/Js loyal customers. Stop overcharging the locals that put you where you are today, greed is the demise of good businesses and root of all evil.",

From the moment we step into this restaurant our mouths immediately start to water and we already know to strap on our seat belts for our cruise through flavortown.   If we're feeling extra hungry, we'll order the Cajun fries as a appetizer. They have a nice kick to them. Great flavor.   Now let's get to the deliciousness. Everytime I go, I order at least 1lb of the shrimp with the hot and juicy seasoning (ordered lemon pepper before, good but not as great) I like good spice but I don't like it to overwhelm the flavor so I'll usually get the mild but sometimes get the medium spice level. Either way I always order a side of the extra hot sauce on the side. The extra hot in my opinion has better flavor, but it's tooo much to handle if I order with the shrimp. So I get it on the side so I could control the spice levels I'm eating. I love this place so much that even if I had bad service (I never do) I wouldn't care because that's how phenomenal the food is.  I can't speak for the other shelled fish options but every time I've gone the shrimp have been big and the portions were great. This will definitely leave your mouth watering and coming back for more!",

It was nice and spicy and I don't like very spicy but it was that kind of hot that was hot but so good that you didn't want to stop eating it. Next time I'll get baby spice or whatever it's called. Lol. The corn and potatoes were good as well. They brought it all in one bag and we shared it. Plenty of food for 2. The seasoning was so hot that I was picking the crab meat and the juice popped in my eyes! WWWOOOWW! Talk about my eyes were on fire !! So beware ... CAUTION * it's hot !!

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and NO COMPASSION TOWARDS CHILDREN AT ALL!!!!!He kicked us out of the restaurant because we brought outside food for our toddler. He told us my son had to eat outside or hurry up and eat. Five minutes later he comes back and says sorry he's taking too long he's gonna have to eat outside.  MAX is an Idiot to think I'm going to rush my son to eat and cause him to choke!!  We've been bringing my son outside food to all or most of their locations all over the valley for 5 years and NO ONE has ever said anything to us about it EVER!! MAX had to be the cold hearted jerk to complain and KICK US OUT! And we didn't want to bring outside food we HAD TO bring Nuggets and Fries from somewhere else because MY CHILD had ADVERSE REACTIONS from the Nuggets and Fries basket that they sell. When we were at their Henderson location the manager there saw my son eating Panda Express and didn't say anything or kick us out. We told them the reason and that we had to bring it and they understood because they didn't want to be held accountable or be liable if something awful were to happen to any of their customers, especially children. They also disclosed that ALL the food they sell has traces of seafood! Because EVERYTHING they cook in their restaurant is fried in the same seafood oil, same cookware, etc.....So, as a parent we weren't going to take that risk. And it's not like we're just taking my son to eat there and we're not ordering from their menu. We eat there once a month averaging $100 each time MAX even had the audacity to say it was his manager complaining and rushing him when that was a damn lie!! Because as we were leaving she said \"Oh you guys don't have to leave\". I told her well MAX told us we have to leave right now and make my son eat outside. So, I don't know what his problem was but he should be suspended or fired for being unprofessional and heartless and doing that to my son. I will never ever eat there again! Nor will I recommend them to our friends and family. What a bad example to such a great establishment. It's employees like MAX that shuts businesses down. Because people will stop going to their establishment therefore the company loses money.  Word of mouth is a powerful thing!  Most especially Reviews like this. It can and will spread like wildfire!! THANK YOU YELP for giving customers a place to  share their experiences and feedback!  Whether positive or negative.",

    "text": "Finally, I got to try the creme de la creme a la cajun-styled seafood: HNJ! I love that crack-a-lackin seafood joints are becoming an upcoming trend.   As a seafood lover, you really can't be afraid to crack-attack, and dig in for your meat. For great seafood, it is oh-so-worth it!  This style is new to the Chicago area, and I have a girlfriend who can't stop raving over how much better this one is than our Chicago options.  Back on to food.  Oysters: we ordered a half dozen. Fresh, yum, cleaned well, good sized meat.  Sausage: a little spicy for my liking, but still good. I don't have too high a tolerance for too much salt.  Snow crab legs: Fat and juicy. Good amount of meat. Good crack to the shell, indicating good freshness. The meat's own sweet flavor still shone through, despite the HNJ sauce we smothered it with love in.  Shrimp: also fat and juicy. fresh and plump, but i couldn't conquer for the life of me. Between 3 girls, we ordered 1lb of crab each, and split a half pound of shrimp.  Even then, too much for us, despite all of its hot and juicy glory.  it made me SOOOO appreciate that this spot supports a half pound of shrimp. Save that cash for the pricier proteins.  extra bonuses: I love that they offered gloves, to keep that seafood smell away from under your nails. The gloves aren't great, and they really mess with your dexterity, but hey. If you've got a hot date, or an outing with friends, you don't want that seafood-smelly-give-away to follow you aruond all day.  Definitely becomin my gold standard. When in Vegas, I'll always have to find my way off the Strip to make it to this joint. It is definitely a go-to-gem that no foodie in Vegas should miss out on!",

It reminded me of alot of the crawfish places in Houston - plastic table covering and a roll of paper towels included.  They were on point with the seasoning and the 'heat' of the food.  Bae ordered Fried Shrimp basket, with an order of catfish...cornmeal batter.  not thick, not dry; I had an order of Crab legs (Lemon butter/Hot) , and a order of shrimp (H&J mix/Hot). and an order of corn fritters.  The food is brought to you in bags....sold by the pound.  Everything was super good...I really liked the lil corn balls....They were just as described to me - fried cream corn...which was AWESOME SAUCE!!!.  They made me happy inside...they gave me life.  All of the seafood was seasoned to the core.  The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were still completely whole....head, eyes, poop-shoot, antennas, legs.... everything - so that was kinda icky....  I don't like having to clean my food before I eat it...I want it to go straight from the plate/bag to my mouth....but, I was a big girl and ripped those heads right on off. I had to request a bucket tho...apparently those do not come automatically to the table....I just can't have those black lil beatty eyes staring back at me while I consume their bodies...Food makes me emotional...but I refuse to feel guilt from a shrimp, damnit!!!!!   The shrimp shells kinda stuck to the meat, so it was hard to get off, and the meat was kinda chewy on a few....but overall - everything was GREAT and Tasty!!  Altho I felt like I was in a strip club, or Raisins on South Park, with the waitress calling everybody - \"Sweetie\" - The service was wonderful.  She was really nice, and efficient.  The drinking water was kinda gross, so I drank my tasty iced tea!  The bathroom was clean, and I liked that they give you numerous pairs of plastic gloves and the bib at the table...Seafood juices will be flyin'!!!! ...And, no one wants to leave out smelling like a yeast infection......  This was a dining success....I definitely hope to return on my next visit to LV!  I want to try the corn, potatoes, and sausage!  We ubered there -  but if you have a car....BEWARE - their parking lot is EXTREMELY small and very hard to get in and out of if there is any type of crowd.",

It's located in what I call \"the Pho Kim Long plaza\", on Spring Mountain.. so be prepared to fight for a parking spot!  Service here is good! Everyone is really friendly and as attentive as they can be for how busy they get. The wait is usually long af but this evening was the first time I've been sat in less than 10 minutes (jackpot!).  Since the last time I was here, they've changed up the menu.  It used to be just seafood by weight, rice/taters/fries/corn, calamari, and now there's basket combos (chicken strips, shrimp, calamari, softshell crab) and po'boys (chicken, shrimp, softshell crab, etc) which I think is nice. One thing that sucks is every time I've been here, they have NEVER had blue crabs available. Because of that, I usually just get shrimp and I get two batches of shrimp - one with the hot n juicy sauce medium or spicy and one with the lemon pepper medium or spicy.  Hot n Juicy is just one of those places everyone in Vegas loves!",

Hot'n'Juicy is one of them (why reinvent the wheel?).  This is how I think Hot'n'Juicy Crawfish Gentlemans Club stacks up against the original Boiling Crab in CA and TX.  CONS: 1. \"It's too much work eating crawfish\", so instead you'll get these huge monstrous crawfish that amount to about 12 in a bag vs. the 50-60 at BC. 2. The flavors?? They just didn't blend as well as BC's, and the crawfish just wasn't immersed long enough in the mixture to absorb any of the flavors. What you get, is some bland crawfish. 3. Even though BC has a slightly cheesy interior, I still love BC by far. You just can't beat their original locations signs in the men's bathroom which read: \"players with shorter bats should stand closer to home plate\" or \"why are you looking up here, when the joke is in your hands\". 4. The waitstaff and service at BC has always been fairly attentive and friendly no matter how busy it gets. HJC's was straightforward and rather distant.  PRO'S: 1. Basically the menu was the same basic menu as BC, so it did make ordering really easy. 2. No wait times! BC usually always has a minimum of a 1 hour wait time for dinner. HJC wasn't too busy for a Tuesday night. 3. The freshness of the dungeness crab was REALLY GOOD at HJC. Probably the best I've had almost anywhere... where are they getting it from!?!?  THE BOTTOM LINE: Always imitated, never duplicated! Boiling Crab definitely reigns supreme, and I highly doubt I'd go back to Hot'n'Juicy unless they start to offer lap dances.",

I did not have to wait 90 minutes for a table like BC, which makes it a huge plus! This was my first crawfish experience, and now I know not to order them next time. So much work for so little payout! I mean really?! I am not gonna pay $10+/lb for lil morsels of meat!  Next time, only crab and shrimp for me!  The shrimp and crab were much better and more meaty payoff. It wasn't the freshest, but for Vegas and the price it wasn't bad.   The hot & juicy special sauce did the job and make me reek of garlic for more than a day after!  I would eat here again and recommend it!",

I'm totally over eating at buffets when in Vegas because I can no longer justify paying $40+ for AYCE when I can't even eat a lot anymore. I did notice that some Yelpers have mentioned seeing this place on Man Vs. Food. I guess I must have missed that episode, but I did see Adam's picture framed on the wall there!  I ended up eating the shrimp, dungeness crab, and crawfish with mild garlic butter sauce. I usually order mild whenever I eat at Boat House or Boiling Crab, which is the perfect amount of spicy for me, but here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish, mild was a little too hot for me to handle. Our server did warn us that their food was a little bit spicier than other places, so I should have better prepared myself. It took a while for our party to finish the food because everyone's mouths were on fire, but we won the battle against the food, even if it was only mild!",

Not even an hour after we checked into our hotel and set down our bags, we were already on our way to hot n juicy crawfish.  We arrived around 6pm on Saturday.  The wait was only a few minutes.  We ordered 1lb of crawfish and 2lbs of dungeness crab. I love traveling west to get my dungeness fix!  We ordered both in the mild hot n juicy sauce.  Our waitress, Robin, told us the mild level wasn't spicy and only had a little kick.  For my newbie taste buds, it was quite the slap! The crawfish soaked up a lot more flavor and spices.  I'm not complaining, but for anyone REALLY averse to spiciness, you're in for a surprise! The dungeness on the other hand was perfection. I was licking the shell and all - that's how amazing it was.   In terms of service, the wait staff is nice, but forgetful.  I get it, they're busy! They won't lie to you if they forget to put in an order.  We found it to be a little charming.  I don't mind being vocal about what I want, so it wasn't a real problem for me.  But I can see how some can be frustrated if an order is forgotten.  I still had a great experience!",

I was still able to enjoy the taste because the spicyness didn't really bite, it just built up as I came close to finishing the bag.

Hot 'N Juicy gets it right.  This is a very casual restaurant. Thin plastic table covers and the big roll of paper towels on each table are a very smart way of handling the mess left behind after handling and eating their bags of food. Yes, bags. Crawfish and shrimp and crab are offered by the pound and everything is served in plastic bags with their own spice and butter. Ordering more is simple: the service is attentive and enthusiastic.  My highest rec is for the shrimp. They're huge and easy to peel. The crawfish are on the small side, and the crab are a lot of work for a little benefit. They do also have sausage, served cut in big pieces. I was lucky to visit with about a dozen people and no one had any complaints with anything they tried.  Our table also looked like the remains of some Roman feast when we were done. Caesars Palace eat your heart out.",

Although I have always thought that eating crawfish involves too much work for the amount of meat, you have to try all their variations on the menu - crab, shrimp, oysters, and of course crawfish.  You can try their different seasonings but their best by far is the \"hot n juicy\" special.   TIPS:  Wear the bib - You may look a bit funny but trust me, you don't want to spill hot n juicy goodness all over your shirt. Be prepared to smell - yes, hot n juicy goodness will follow you around for about a week, specially the smell of garlic in your hands.  :)",

Could've used more seasoning, but it was  pretty decent considering the size of their Brown River Crawfish. I'd say the crawfish & the sauce here is tastier than Boiling Crab, but I still like Crab Hut much better. If Crab Hut served these steroid induced crawfishes...I'd be there prepared for high cholesterol.   Customer service kinda sucked cuz we ordered Calamari, which never came out...even after several reminders. Other than that everything else was great...we will be coming back the next time we're in Vegas & will continue to tell our friends about this place.",

Tables were simple and covered with wax paper, which is expected since eating crawfish tends to get messy (they do give you bibs, but you shouldn't go in wearing your best and most expensive clothes).  We ordered two pounds of crawfish and an order of fried catfish.  Prices of the shellfish are market value, so you have to ask the wait staff (when we went, the price of crawfish was approximately $10 per pound.)  You then choose the type of seasoning you want for your crawfish and how spicy you want it.  We went with the Hot N Juicy special seasoning and Hot heat level, which was very delicious.  The Catfish was decent, but nothing special.  When you come here, stick with the shellfish.    I recommend this place.  Be sure to get here early, as it isn't a big place and fills fast, and expect it to be messy and fun!",

What made the experience awesome was the customer service we received. They were super busy for it being 8:30pm a whole hour in a half before they closed. And yet they still kept the place going everyone got seated in a timely manner and the people that worked there were super friendly! They made sure we were good kept our waters full made sure we had everything we needed and kept the drinks coming! Thank you Hot and Juicy for a wonderful first time experience! I will be back!",

The sauce we ordered was watery. I was expecting some type of butter sauce but instead got not so well seasoned soup to dip my seafood in. A pound of snow crab should not be one cluster!!!That was an obvious scam!!! One cluster!?!? Really?!?? I've eaten a lot of seafood in my life so I know what a pound of snow crabs should equates to!!! Definitely not one cluster!!!! That was annoying!!! I actually just took away a star because of the portion. I wish I took a picture!!! Don't waste your time here!!! I do not recommend this place.",

The 1 lb of shrimp with hot n juicy flavor (everything) and medium spicy is my usual. I also love to add corn and sausage. For sides definitely get white rice, sweet potato fries and oysters if ya'll feeling extra.   Beware this location is small so expect a 20 min+ wait during peak dinner hours. Call in advance to check wait times, but they dont take reservations.  The service is fast and friendly and they get refills quick so you won't go thirsty.   I really love boiling crab since they use more garlic and have a tad more flavor but this place def wins with the corn fritters.",

Waitress said it was 5/10 heat, and my friend who eats spicy and settled on mild for me was burning up too.   Only reason this isn't a solid 4 or 5 is the sauce itself was pretty salty. Other than that, this place did the job of fixing our Boiling Crab craving!",

Especially when in Vegas, you are suckered in usually by the Gimmicky restaurants on the strip, it can become quite difficult to pick out the good food from the bad !   This seafood boil was great ! fast, fresh and friendly service ! The portions were quite large, and also real damn flavourful. I enjoyed the Hot n Juicy Sauce a lot which combined all their flavours.   We ended up trying everything Snow Crab , clams, shrimps, and crawfish ! A pound of each. Came to about $68.00 with tax. !   It's also easy to get to if your on the strip it's across the bridge near the Venetian Hotel!",

    "text": "This was my first time here and I absolutely loved it.  First of all about the place itself - it has a very relaxed and non-pretentious vibe, you kind of feel like walking into your friend' house with the exception of rather weird set up - yes, the tables are all covered with white plastic table tops, but by no means it takes away from the atmosphere and charm, rather compliments it.  We came five minutes before the opening, so we could pick almost any table we liked (by the time we arrived, there were already two girls waiting for the spot to be opened).  For the party of 6 (4 grown ups and 2 kids) here's what we've ordered - Get your feet wet (1lb of crawfish, 1lb of shrimp, dozen of Andouille sausages , 2 corns and 2 potatoes); 1lb of snow crab legs in lemon pepper sauce, 1lb of clams in garlic butter sauce, 1 lb of shrimps in hot n juicy sauce, 1lb of shrimps baby spice, fried shrimp basket and fried catfish basket. The bill came to the total of 129USD.   There's something particularly inspiring and liberating in eating with your hands and not having to worry if you are sucking the sauce out of the crawfish head too loudly. Because guess what it's an \"eat as messy as you want\" environment!)   The spice mix in the sauces was really flavourful but not overpowered the seafood - quite a tough equilibrium to achieve, so I have to command the chefs for getting this part quite right. My personal favourite were the crab legs in lemon pepper sauce - tangy, spicy, bursting with robust flavour.   Got to confess that I have stolen a piece of fried shrimp from the kids and it was so good (the shrimp, not the stealing part lol). The batter was light and crispy, perfect coating for the delicately moist shrimp hidden inside this golden corn flour shell.   Cant wait till we'll be back!",

It was also featured on man vs. food.  Didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  So we decided on dinner here tonight.  We got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  I don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!   We actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  The bartender there told us that that was pretty common.    So we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  We started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of king crab legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  We also ordered fried shrimp sweet potato fries, corn and potatoes and a round of beers.   The tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  No silverware.  The food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  They are deiivered in plastic bags.  Oh man, the crawfish was delicious! Hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  My mouth was on fire inside and out!  But i couldnt stop!  Everything was really good.  Spicy, buttery and garlicy....Yum!  We ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of crab legs and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  Sweet, but so spicy.   A very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  The prices were reasonable as well.  I will definitely go back here.",

    "text": "We heard about this place Spring of 2010 and finally went January 2011 when I was in the mood for some mud-bugs!  We moved to Las Vegas from Louisiana. We only lived in Louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food!  My husband and I got the same thing; 2 pounds of Crawfish with Spicy Cajun (Louisiana Style, Garlic Butter and Lemon Pepper) flavoring with medium spice level. I myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of Crawfish. Medium was even spicier than what we ever had in Louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to.  The Crawfish was pretty good all in all. My husband and I both only had about 5 good sized Crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. So that was a disappointment. I wish that they would clean the the Crawfish before they cook them. It's not fun looking at a Crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya I know their called mud-bugs but still. I know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. Your going to a Crawfish joint not a Chinese Buffet with Crawfish.  It was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in Louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. During off season with live Crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (On the menu for Crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) They don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. For all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. Crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. We will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from Louisiana and doing our own Crawfish boil so we'll see. If we were staying here in Vegas I'm sure we would go back.   I",

Last time we went with his family and his father literally did not get his iced tea until I asked to speak with a manager and we were almost done with the meal. When I spoke with the manager he did not seem to care at all until I told him I would be writing a review online and that I would like the owners card.  I had dropped my fries at one point (again this is the second visit) and the server picked them up off the ground asked me if I wanted them still. I said no I wanted fresh fries. It took about 20 minutes for me to get new fries. I was paranoid after that the staff might spit in my food, but really what else could I do. Overall it was a waste of my money and patience I will save my patronage for a place that won't offer me fries off the floor...and I think I should add that any time I asked for something the staff made me feel like I was bothering them.",

Most dishes are served straight from boil bag and you discard the shells directly on the plastic covered tables.

It's off the strip near Chinatown.  We walked in and were greeted by very friendly staff members.  The food was great!  A lot less sauce than the crawfish places I've tried in the Bay Area.  If you like spicy foods, definitely go with spicy....medium is nothing!  The seafood is very fresh!  You can tell because it's easy to take the meat out.  I think their sauce is really good - you will literally find smashed garlic in the sauce, which makes is all the more yum-O!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  The service is great.  The waitress has very quick and very friendly.  She informed us that they'll be opening one up in SF pretty soon so I'll be looking forward to that.  One caveat - be prepared to have garlic cajun breath for many hours after you've eaten here.  No, it doesn't even go away after a handful of mints and mouthwash.  So worth it tho...",

Another gem located way off the strip on Spring Mountain Rd which is asian food heaven from what I saw driving around.  The place was crowded which is always a good sign.  The crawfish was very fresh as I think we are nearing peak season.  Nice big juicy suckers with plenty of tail meat.  All crustaceans (crawfish, king/snow crab, dungeness crab, blue crab and shirmp) have a choice to be bathed with mild to extra spicy seasoning sauce.  The spice level is as stated.  No watering it down for the tourists.  When they mean spicy, it will be spicy.  Best to avoid the extra spicy unless you are participating in some food challenge or trying to show off.  Not really a first date kind of place but heck if you bring someone here you both should know what you are getting in to.  Parking is beyond tiny and likely you will need to park on the side street which is a little on the sketchy side.  The servers were all fun and eager to please with refills constantly coming.",

In a nutshell...she loved this place !!!  DO NOT wEAR YOUR SUNDAY BEST TO THIS PLACE !!  Yes, they give you a big roll of paper towels on the table....yes they give you that tacky lobster bib ( USE IT...YOU'RE NOT TO COOL )  she ordered a pound of the crawfish w/ house special sauce ( basically all the other sauces combined ) extra spicy.....i ordered the shrimp and sausage with medium sauce ( yeah,...i admit...i'm a wimp ! )  before getting the food my SO kept yakking about some city in china ( it may have been shanghai ...can't remember ) that there is a street of restaurants that only serve spicy crawfish ...she loves the stuff....she can be picky  about the food and how it's served - i was pleased she did not have attitude when her food came out in a plastic bag - no plates, forks, etc...just a bag of food...she put down a paper towel and she went to town...every now and then she would say...\"so good\"  or \"yummy-yummy\"  but for the most part just  kept working on those lil buggers...her cheeks getting redder and redder due to the heat...she was in heaven...we ordered another poiund...she ate that...she was still hungry....she is not a big eater....we ordered 2 pounds to go  Overall, it is a fun place...next time we will try the crab...btw...the shrimp were very good, lots of butter and garlic...i asked the server if they served bread ( they don't ) i wanted a roll to slop up the sauce at the bottom of the bag !!  a little pricey - total bill was $66...and we were still hungry ( but we did have an extra 2 pound bag ...SO ate that the next day for lunch )  we need places like this in the vegas valley !!!  Variety is the spice of life  UPDATE - 2ND VISIT -  tried the blue crab....SO loved it...too much work for me... after one crab, i went back to the shrimp - i was pleased to see they listen to their customers - they added the option of buying rice and also rolls....they also had a special - $2.50 coronas and heinekens....again, maybe a little pricey but this place is all good !  UPDATE 3RD VISIT ----  they've added king crab legs to the menu ...$20.95 / pound ....i guess i'm an elitist ...my only complaint about the KCL ...they don't cut them in 1/2 ....very tasty ! SO did her usual - 2 lbs of crawfish at the restaurant, 2 pounds to go - she thought this was the freshest batch of crawfish she's had in our 5 visits to H&J !",

They don't do free potatoes/corns with your order per lb anymore.  It's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each.   Service was great in my opinion.  You're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  LOL  This last time we came in an hour before they closed.  There was no line.  The server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  We ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 corns, 3 potatoes all hot n' juicy mild and cajun fries.  I have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  We should have done the baby spice.  I don't remember if being that spicy.    Overall, we were all really satisfy.  Happy and stuffed.",

This is an eatery with fluctuating prices based on market sales, so what a pound of shrimp costs today might not be what it costs tomorrow. And their entire menu lists \"Market Price\" where you'd normally find actual numbers.   So, where do they display this crucial information?  On the back of my waitress' order book.   They used to have a BIG SIGN advertising the day's prices. You know what's there now? A couple fucking TVs. How ingenious! Why let your customers know your prices when they could instead zone out on some fucking game and ignore the people they're dining with, all while annoying a waitress by making her hold up her \"price guide\" while I decide if I want king crab or clams.   Best part: there isn't even a fucking bar in front of the fucking TVs. Not that this place even needs one, but the lack of seating around these TVs proves their lack of worth even more so.   If you own this place/are a manager: lose the fucking boob tubes and try to look like a real eatery, not another jerk-off spot with 26 TVs.

We had a few people visiting from Texas, so my best friend Randy and I had to be strategic about getting a party of 10 people in this small space. Since they don't take reservations, I planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. The wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. By the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! Wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant.  The food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! I don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. I ordered a pound of the KING CRAB LEGS (market price today was $25.99/lb) with the Hot N Juicy Special (all the seasonings combined) in Medium. Oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! It was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so I utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. I think there needs to be gardening gloves and/or real towels for those heavy duty crab legs! It can be pretty dangerous. Ruben and I also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries. All delicious! But that Hot N Juicy Special seasoning/sauce, WOW.  Wonderful, wonderful place. The service was just okay, but I know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling crab legs that you forget your server hasn't checked on you. As long as they remember to keep the beverages filled, there's nothing lacking. Can't wait to go back!",

No one goes there for the filling. They go for the KICKASS flavor!  There are 5 or so levels of flavoring, ranging from basic to complex. There are about as many levels of heat.   I've eaten here many times and have NEVER been disappointed!",

    "text": "I knew I shouldn't have come here after having a early morning flight from Dulles Airport but I was convinced by my sister that it was a must have even if I was dead tired, sleepy and knowing i had to go out in the next few hours AND just got my french manicure.  We arrived by taxi which was no problem and got seated immediately.  I looked at all of the bibs and thought that this surely would make me pass out with no problem.  I did the best I could, I told our waiter that I needed cokes and any drink with caffeine.  I decided NOT to order the crawfish and went ahead and ordered the shrimp.  My sister went ahead and got the crawfish daggonit and a side of fries.    It all started really good, I felt alive,  I doubled up on my gloves and I felt like I could get past this 'tiredness' like I used to in college just push on through it.  I even got a crawfish from our 1 pound bag and thought - this is no big deal.  Handful of fries - gone. Broke off the heads of the shrimp (yes, they have the heads on) and threw them back in the bag and kept eating.  I then came up for air and then it hit - that coma, that feeling that takes over you as you realize you might have had a little too much and not only that you're 3 hours behind your NORMAL time.  Then i gave up.  To make matters even worse we walked outside and got punched in the face due to the heat.  We had a great time there and the service and food was great.  Just a note to those who did NOT rent a car and taxi their way through Vegas -- Taxi's are NOT frequent here so call ahead about 30 minutes before you leave.  4 Stars.",

As for me, it's just A-OK.  They have really great service here.  Even though we were here with only half the party, they sat the first half and let us order first.  It took over 30 minutes for the other half of our party to arrive.  That was really accommodating.  I had some of the shrimp and corn with the hot'n'juicy seasonings.  It was good and what I expected out of this place.  Decently fresh seafood with some spices.  The things I don't like about these places are that they aren't environmentally friendly at all.  You're doing this picnic style with plastic bags, styrofoam cups, plastic utensils.  They even dole out rolls of paper towels.  I can't get behind that kind of restaurant or paying through the nose to de-shell my own seafood.  Still, the food is above decent and I always love me some good seafood.",

We always start off with a round of oysters, fried calamari, and their cajun fries.  Then we are off to pounds and pounds of crawfish, king crab legs, dungeness crabs and shrimps.  Our prefer seasoning is the Hot N Juicy special with the spicy level of spice.  Boy is it spicy, but sure hits the spot.  The seafood is always fresh here and the fried food stays crispy and is non-greasy.  You really cannot go wrong with this place if you are an avid seafood lover.",

    "text": "Really good stuff, everything tasted fresh, spicy as their name and menu suggests and you get reasonable portions for the amount you pay. I had 1lb of crawfish, 1lb of shrimp, and 1lb of clams, and in retrospect I would say 2.5 lbs instead of the 3lbs I had would have been a better choice as I was extremely full after this. If you like crawfish then go ahead and order it here, if you never had it or are on the fence I would refrain because a) its much harder to eat than the other items b) they can be somewhat small so you spend a lot of time for little meat.  I am docking a star because of the garlic overpower at times, and surprisingly it lasts for about 10 hours after you eat and you will have it in your breath and constantly taste it even after brushing your teeth. Wake up in the morning and you might be burping garlic flavors. They have a few different flavors so not everything has to be spicy and hot but it all mixes so it tastes pretty much the same.",

We shared pounds and pounds and bags and bags of crawfish/clams/corn ranging from mild to medium. Food was really good. Only complaint if it is one, is that the medium should be called hot and mild should be medium.  Service was friendly and good.  Some small cons were that parking was really annoying and some of the food options were a little limited for my taste. I'd still come back here when I'm in Vegas though.",

I heard great things about this place, but when it came down to tasting the food myself, the excitement suddenly stopped. I mean, the sauce was decent. However, my brothers complained that the sauce was too plain, and that their shrimp and crawfish were not drenched enough in sauce. Also, the sauce was surprisingly not as spicy as the server described it to be. I must say, I certainly did NOT like the sausages that I ordered. Worst sausages in my life. I seriously could not force it down for the life of me. It was also a no-go with the chicken nuggets for me. I recall cafeteria nuggets tasting better...   Service was a bit slow and unorganized. The place was pretty darn small too. Once the dinner rush started, many parties ended up huddled around the bathroom. Not very comfortable if you ask me.   I think I might try the newer Hot n Juicy the next time I'm in town. My brothers raved about the newer location being better than the kickin krab (my absolute fav) back at home. Unfortunately, I went with the overall statistics of THIS place and paid the price: cranky brothers and an unsatisfied stomach.",

It was actually entertaining watching the waitresses run around and pick up trash bag after trash bag ((that's what they use as table cloths)). The food was fantastic. I took my 5 friends who are visiting from out of town and they loved it. The food took a little longer to get to the table and a few things were missing from our bags ((your sides are included in the bags of food))  which was a little disappointing but the service definitely made up for it. There's plenty of servers willing to help at a moments notice . Our server Martha was very attentive she came by every few minutes just to make sure everything  was in order.  We overlooked the  minimal mistakes simply because she kept us in the loop of our upcoming food and was very sweet and apologetic.  My only complaint is that I wish their waiting area was a little more \"people friendly\". You either wait by a back wall inside the restaurant which you can imagine gets very full or outside where the weather isn't always the best . Other than that it was AMAZING!",

I actually was kinda upset about it when we were in Vegas last time. We didn't get to try it because we were in a rush. Anyway, I'm here now, so I'm happy.  We got there around 7 o'clock on a Saturday night. Its was so busy  that we had to wait for a table. I was so hungry at that moment, but couldn't help. We finally got sat after a 30 minutes wait. The server came over and asked us if we been there before. I been to Boiling Crab a lot and the menu is pretty similar. I just told the server I'm ready because I'm so hungry at that moment.  We ordered 4 lbs crawfish, 2 lbs shrimp, and a sweet potato fries for 4 people. We got the hot n juicy special sauce as it similar to the whole she-bang and we got spicy level. After 5 minute, we started to get our foods. I was so happy at that moment. I finally got to try the hot n juicy crawfish place.  We sat there an hour and we finally finish up everything. I kinda felt bad for the people that waiting for our table. Anyway, I liked this place even those I'm a fan of Boiling Crab, too. Their sauce compared to Boiling Crab was a little different. They all had their own unique taste. I like it both. For our trip, We like the food and the service was good, too. Its was so spicy. I drank like 4 or 5 cups of soda, so the serve had to keep refill my drink.",

Worst service ever, nothing compared to the first time we've been there. Honestly, the first time we were there late last year food was awesome (almost as good as BC)  Was there for a late late lunch and we were all starving. I recommended this spot to my fellow travelers and said it's worth the wait and just as good as BC. Waited for about 1 hour and this is a late late lunch around 2-3pm. Got seated and waiter took our order. He confirmed the order and everything was correct. Food came 15 min later. Sauce taste so watered-down, no flavor what so ever. Nothing like the first time we were there. Not only that our friend had ordered 2 lbs of king crab legs. 1 with their special sauce and 1 just steamed (plain.) Everybody got their food except for the steam crab legs. We kept reminding them that we still have not received it and it's been about 20 mins. 5 min later, still nothing. Told another waitress/waiter to check on it. Again, 5 mins later, still nothing. It's been 45 mins and still nothing. Everybody is done eating and one of us still have not gotten plain crab legs. WTH!!! So again, we ask if they have forgotten our order and they said No, it's on order. Told us crab legs takes an average of 25 mins to steam, but yet we got the first lb with sauce and everything in 15 min. Why does it take longer for plain crab legs? Everybody is completely done now and we still did not get the crab legs. We ask what was going on and they said, again we are doing everything we can to fulfill orders and it's very busy and for us to just hang in there. Nobody else was waiting to get seated. There were empty tables and people who came in after us was already finishing up their food. WTH!!! So we ask for the manager and the jerk in charge said with a smile \"there's no manager available right now\" and walked away. We saw the waiter ask him what was going on with their order and he threw his hands in the air, said \"i dunno\" and walked away. Obviously somebody was in charge at the time. WTH!!! And their apology to us was that they will not charge us gratuity since we were not happy. OMG!!! I can't believe this place even made it on the Travel Channel now. We paid for our food even after the way they treated us. Not only that, as I was walking to the restroom to wash my hands, the girl in charge was on the phone with the owner and was explaining to him how it happened and if he hears anything about it... that's what really happened. WTH!!! That did it!!! That was the last call!!! Never ever going there again and never going to recommend it to anybody else. Horrible!!!",

They were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the king crab, whole blue crab, crawfish, and calamari. The crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the Hot n Juicy sauce. The sauce was very good. Plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. Add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. I would definately go back.  The only minus is that they really have nothing BUT seafood. Several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was chicken wings(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. A bit small of a non seafood choice.  Our waitress was very helpful and attentive as well.",

Alas the time had come and I dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to SoCal.  There are four different sauces you can choose from: Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Special. We got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  They were covered in Garlic Butter and the Hot n Juicy Special.  We also got cajun fries and sausage.  Everything was so full of flavor.  All the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  The crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  However, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) I would definitely go back during my next Vegas trip.",

Order the dungenous crab (they were out), blue crab (they were out too) and settled with: crawfish, shrimp and alaskan king crab, and an order of cajun fries.  The dinner might have been better with dungenous crab, but overall was just OK.  The crawfish -- there isn't anything there.  So little meat.  Brings back memories of  \"Where's the beef\" commercials. The shrimp was good and the king crab was OK.  You can tell that the crab was frozen.  The cajun fries were good and spicy.  Remember to dress comfortably & wash your hands when you get there.  You eat with your hands here and there are lots of paper towels on the table for you to use.  Having tried Crawfish, I probably won't return on the next trip to LV.",

Both the garlic butter sauce and the house special sauce had way too much garlic on them (my breath smell like garlic for more than 2 days).  The fried cat fish and the soft shell crab weren't that good either, we had better one before.  I think the crawdaddy in San Jose and boiling crab in Orange county have much better food than here.",

Honestly, it's all about the sauce.  you can dip a dirty old sock (i got the hot n juicy special which is like a combo of all the sauces) and it would taste good.  the crayfish was pretty hard to eat - takes a lot of time to deshell and the meat isn't that tasty to make it worth the effort.  the shrimp is a much better - less work, less shelling, and they give you pretty descent size shrimp for $10.99 a pound.  my only complaint is that they don't really sell any carbs to go with that delicious sauce - like some white rice, or bread or pasta.  i would go find that old sock to dip it in, so i can eat more of the sauce.  it is very messy, so don't go in your sunday best.  and you will probably need a change of clothes, bath and manicure after eating here, but it's pretty well worth the trip.  if i lived in vegas, i would do the take out - because it's kinda embarrassing licking your fingers in public, and walking out with all these little splatters all over your shirt.",

Our group of 4 was greeted and seated quickly, but getting us menus and our orders took a while.  We saw another group who was seated after us get their menus, orders in, and drinks before we even got our menus.  We finally waved someone down after 15 min of servers walking past us, and he didn't seem very enthusiastic to help us.  He first said \"So is it your first time here?\" and I say yes, he says with (ugh)\"it seems like its everyone's first time here today...\" and goes on about how to order and everything.  We've been to other similar seafood places like this back home so we are not totally new to this type of place, but it was our first time.. still, whatever.  The Hot n Juicy sauce here is awesome!  We ordered regular spicy, but I think we could handle extra spicy!  Its a nice garlic-buttery-spicy sauce.  My friend ordered the Garlic Butter sauce but it was not good at all.    The king crab legs are huge, and one order came with only 4 legs.  I was a little disappointed because the seafood places back home (very similar to this) serve more legs.  The food also took forever to get to us.  We got our orders really far apart from each other, and they seemed to forget our rice.  The servers were prompt with filling our drinks though.",

We had excellent service here (5 different waitstaff helping us out and refilling our iced teas, cleaning trash, feeding Derek's sugar packet habit, etc).    We got the soft shell crab basket to start since Derek never had it before.  It was a bit overfried but tasty, and the cajun fries were tasty.  For the meal we had 1 lb hot n juicy medium shrimp, 1 lb hot n juicy spicy crawfish, 1 lb hot n juicy extra spicy crawish, and corn + potato + rice.  The conclusion: the shrimp were large, juicy, flavorful and tasty.  The spicy crawfish was our favorite - not too hot but the spice added up enough to give us that delicious burning flavor on the tongue and runny nose/watery eyes.  The flavor also was great.  The extra spicy crawfish had a nice intense spice, but the butter and overly powdered seasoning muddled the flavor.    The corn and rice were nice \"neutralizers\" - next time we go here we would get the spicy level with anything.  A fun, messy, bib-ilicious experience!  and yes, I felt like a garlic breathing dragon all day!",

This place is in such an unsuspecting area and the parking lot a  little tiny.  But once you open the door the sweet smell of butter and garlic fill the room.  There was a little wait which I was surprised about bc places like this in LA have an hour wait minimum!!   The food was good!! My bf and I got the Hot N Juicy Special, Spicy on shrimp.  I'd get the crawfish but I was too tired to put in the effort for such a small amount of meat.  We also ordered the deep fried soft shell crabs with corn & cajun fries.  LOVE LOVE LOVED the soft shell crabs!! They were soo tasty and so crabby!  I just wish they had more in that basket!  I believe it only came with like 8 or something like that but I could have definitely went for another basket if I wasn't concerned with spending too much $$$ there.  The shrimp was awesome but almost TOO spicy!! I love heart in my food but this made my lips burn so I prob could have went medium on them.  But the shrimp were decently sized and cooked perfectly.  I hate when shrimp are overcooked but HNJ did not disappoint in that aspect.  Great place to go if you are craving some seafood southern style!  Be prepared to get down a dirty because eating with your hands is a MUST!!! Get those napkins ready..you'll be needing them =]",

You order a pound (or five) of whatever seafood you want in whatever sauce you want and they bring it to you in a plastic bag so you can get your hands dirty! Oh, and it gets messy (but don't worry, they have a bib for that).  This place is pretty packed and there's a wait, but it's worth it. There are many types of seafood to choose from (shrimp, crab, crawfish, etc) as well as seasonings and the level of spice you want. Hot N Juicy Special was the best. The price is relatively low, the shrimps were decently sized, and the service was excellent. If you don't want to get your fingers dirty, you can always ask for gloves (but where's the fun in that). Also, remember to add Cajun fries and a side of rice (if you're local like me)!  Since there's no place like this back home, I'm going to have to try replicating this in my kitchen. :)",

You let that shrimp swim in their Hot N Juicy special sauce and you're in seafood heaven. Make sure you add some corn to that bag of shrimp. I love corn to begin with, but after it's been soaking in that sauce, it becomes absolutely amazing.  Be ready to get down and dirty with your seafood at this place.

I am pretty opened minded with food and wanted to give it a good shot.   The place is busy, I definitely recommend planing to arrive with the possibility you will have to wait a minute for a table. My girlfriend and I had a lb of Shrimp mild with the hotnspicy special seasoning and a lb of blue crap with garlic butter. We also ordered the cajun fries and corn fritters.   The shrimp showed up in a bag marinating in the sauce, the crab came shortly after in its own bag with the fries and fritters in tow. It was messy to eat and absolutely delicious!! I would definitely recommend the pace to anyone who wants to go enjoy some delicious seafood with incredible flavor. We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food!!",

I got there at 730 and asked for a table for 3, they said 25 minute wait, no problem. About 8:05 they called my name and sat us in the back in a half booth but it had a square table so it was really akward. A round table would have been much better.  To eat, I ordered 1lb of shrimp with the hot n' juicy seasoning, and then added a piece of corn and potato. My friends both ordered 1lb of king crab with lemon pepper and juicy cajun seasonings. Right after our server took our order, a big party of 15 came in and was seated right next to us. Our server tended to them immediately. After about 25 minutes we have had no refills, and we have no food. I start to notice that people who came in AFTER us are getting their food. I joke and say \"I think they forgot about us.\" We stop a waitress and ask whats going on and she tells us some bullshit lie that our food is coming but that we have the king crab and that can take a little bit longer. Now its been at least 45 minutes and no food. Our server finally comes to our table and tells us she is so sorry and so embarassed but she forgot to put our order in, but she put it in right now and it is being pushed to the front of the line. Now at this point im PISSED off. She was soo worried about serving the table of 15 and just forgot about us. Before we even get our food the table of 15 is already starting to get appetizers. Our food finally came around 9:10 and it was good thats why the 2 stars. The hot n juicy seasoning is delicious but SOO garlicky. I still smell like garlic today. I tried some of my friends lemon pepper crab and that was reallly good. For 2lbs of king crab and 1lb of shrimp our total was like $80 which is not bad. But I will not be back because of the shitty service. I will try the other location a little bit down the street and hope we dont get forgotten about.  FYI the servers  name is ASHLEY, dont get her because she FORGETS everything! Even the people next to us were mad because she forgot to add potatoes and corn to their bag.",

I brought a friend who was in town for CES here for dinner on 1/9/2013. We had one lobster and a pound of shrimp accompanied by rice, sausages, corn, and rolls. We made quick work of the shrimp but had trouble opening the lobster, which was where Valerie came in. She happily broke the lobster, displaying a steady hand laced with aggression.  The service at Hot N Juicy Crawfish was excellent. I like it when any server can help you out. One server took our order, another one brought out glasses of water, another one cracked our lobster, and another one brought out our beers. They're very accommodating and understanding of the messy premise of eating crustaceans swimming in bags of spicy sauce. I saw one server rolling up the sleeves of a customer at a neighboring table.

I've had the crab legs as well and didn't think they were worth the price. 2. Order Hot n Juicy sauce mild or medium. The mild used to be pretty spicy but last time I was there, it wasn't as hot. Did they change their ratio of seasonings? 3. The catfish is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! The cornbread coating was crispy and not oily at all. 4. It gets messy but that's part of the experience. They even give you a cute little bib.  What really impressed me was my server the last time I was there. I forget her name but she was such a sweetheart. She took the time to explain the menu to my friends and she was very patient. Keep up the good work guys.",

    "text": "So hot, so juicy, so good. So this is what everyone's been raving about. \"I mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" I wondered to myself as I waited in line, albeit I expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. For people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, Hot N Juicy is 5 stars for sure.   For me, however, I don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and I prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before I devour them. Nevertheless, I must say I enjoyed Hot N Juicy. I ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature Hot N Juicy special sauce, medium-level spicy. If you order two pounds or more, you get corn and potatoes thrown in the bag. I wish they would include corn and potatoes with one pound orders though...  With plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, I opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. The worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. It takes a long time. But I guess it's good to eat slow. The best part about this Hot N Juicy experience is the sauce. The sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. Make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. The sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. While some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). I detest mushy shrimp!  What would make Hot N Juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order. That would be cajun heaven right there!",

I first ordered 1 pound of shrimps, 1 pound of blue crabs and one basket of catfish (pretty much my usual). I shared it of course with my sis. Both shrimp and crab was made in the Hot n Spicy sauce mild. Some of my friends got the highest spice level (cringe). The shrimps were huge compared to what I'm use too! This was the first thing that came out and me and my sis went thru it pretty fast and since she wasn't having any of the crabs we decided to get another pound.... terrible mistake cause she got pretty full so we ended up sharing with our whole group hehe. I lucked out on the crab. Both females!!! and I love the eggs so I was a happy camper :D   One thing and its a very little thing, the cajan fries were not very cajan. It was barely seasoned to what I'm use to... But this place is definitely GREAT!!! Make it a place to stop by if your partying in vegas for the weekend",

I ordered 1 pound of crawfish medium spicy with their special sauce, 1 order of dungeness crab legs and both were delicious! The sauce was just right, not too oily, had a great garlic flavor. I also ordered a piece of corn to sop up the sauce.   I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood!",

I got the 2lb crawfish cajun style and the bf got some sort of fried platter with fries.  I don't remember if this place gives you the option of choosing live or frozen, but these crawfish were definitely big.  Both entrees were really tasty and was great to wash down with a couple of Coronas.  Side note: As much I love munching down on some crawfish, I absolutely hate the fishy smell it leaves on your hands. My recommendation? Be the loser who uses the gloves ;)  Yes, I am that loser.",

The hubby had been here before on a seperate trip and always raved about this place and how \"once you eat here you can never eat at boiling crab or any other place again\".  Now I believe him!  The menu and format is the same, but their sauce is 100% times better. The spicy one is just the perfect level of savory, spicy all together in a bag of yummy goodness.  We wanted clams but they sold out to our dismay, so we got some mussells, shrimp, crayfish, corn, and etoufee. Crayfish didnt have much meat and was a bit small, but its good to suck the heads!   Everything was delicious and came out pipping hot. Service was friendly.  I WISH we had one of these in the bay area.  A must for foodies while in Vegas.",

They do not have much on the menu, but what they do they do very well.  Border line 5 review.  I think the only thing holding it back from a 5 is the nature of crawfish itself.  I don't mind getting messy but it is a lot of work for not a whole lot of sustenance from each crustacean.  If I were to go there again, I would probably get the shrimp.  Less work, more reward.  The food comes out in boiled bags which you rip open.  Good idea to use the bib which is provided.  I went for one less than the spiciest sauce, and they were much spicier than used to when ordering at that level.",

Definitely better than salty Boiling Crab but just a tad behind our local Ray's Crab. We had 2lbs of shrimp, 2bls of clams, sweet potato fries, and rice. I liked their clams the best; tender and delightful. Big plus on their servers that could definitely strike up some conversation.   What I like the most is that their hot is hot and not watered down. Its definitely a tingling sensation in my palette that is delightful and pleasing. I am pretty sure their spicy could be a workout.   We will probably be back if we desire hot cajun seafood and we are in Vegas.",

Their cajun sauce has a better kick and is a little more garlicky and spicy, which I like.  Get shrimp with the whole Hot n' Juicy cajun sauce and adjust according to your spice level.  Then prepare for a great meal.  They give you bibs and plastic gloves so as to not dirty yourself while you shamelessly devour into succulent shrimp and eat like you haven't eaten in days.  Wait time can be a bit long depending on how many people are in your party, but it's worth the wait and oh-so-delicious.  Come.  That is all.",

    "text": "Robyn, my future daughter-in-law had her trepidations about bringing me to Hot 'n Juicy Crawfish... In the past few years, virtually every place she thought I would like turned out to me... just Average, at best... And she heard from my youngest kids, that Dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at Hot 'n Juicy.  When your Pound of either Blue Crab, Shrimp, or Crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the Plastic Bib and the Paper Towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting MESSY! In fact, I'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.  You'll receive a free Cob of Corn and a small Potato with every 2 Pounds of stuff ordered. But, I recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the HEAT from the Crawfish.  Hot 'n Juicy's recommendation of how to eat Crawfish is:  1) Gently twist the head apart from the tail.  2) Take the head and SUCK the juice from inside.  3) Peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.  4) Pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.  I have a few modifications to this procedure... Why would I suck on a Crawfish head when I don't do it to it's bigger cousin Lobster? That just.... SUCKS! I break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.  The absolute best value is the Shrimp... I treat the Shrimp at Hot 'n Juicy like the Salt & Pepper Shrimp that is prepared at Chinese restaurants. I consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the Shrimp! When Robyn heard that --- Eww!  Robyn's recommendation: Order a pound of Blue Crab Legs and a pound of Shrimp.  Kevin and Kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: Crawfish and Shrimp.  My suggestion: After a Crawfish & Shrimp combo... I'd go for a Shrimp and Shrimp...  Suggestions for sides - Bread Rolls, Potatoes, Sausages are OK. Corn on the Cob, which is boiled along with the Crawfish literally turns into Cream of Corn - way too soft.  And... don't Breathe and Eat at the same time! Took me a few minutes to recover from the HEAT going down! Kevin tried some of my Spicy Crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. I think for most - Spicy is hot enough.  Robyn was totally shocked when I gave Hot 'n Juicy a Yelper rating of 5-Stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting Messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the Soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a Bath / Shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!  I can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the Crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.  I was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated Chinatown along Spring Mountain... So far as I could see that evening, there was only one waitress of Asian descent... I queried our waitress whether Hot 'n Juicy was Asian-owned - she replied that the owner was Thai and resided in Texas and was the second Crawfish place he owned.  Highly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....  I do have one last thought though.... What exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a Plastic Bag? Are there any chemical breakdowns of the Plastic Bag that the USDA should be worried about?",

The shrimp are cooked with the heads which makes the plump shrimp meat so delicious and moist.

Since the latest competition, Boiling Crab, migrated towards the valley from Southern California we could see that the battle of the rivals are still in order. The question is, who serves the best shrimp?  I'll be brutally honest that my point of view is biased because i have yet to taste the savory goodness of Boiling Crab. So until I have tried its savory goodnes, my critic will rest at recommending Hot and Juicy until further notice.   Besides the raving hype that Adam Richman did feature Hot and Juicy on man V. Food, I can say that the feshness and the flavor of the seafood here are just to DIE FOR. Literally, you eat all the shrimp and crab you can consume until you fall face first first into a food coma (this my ideal way of leaving this earth).   I love the spice and tangy flavor of their famous Hot and Juicy sauce. My first mistake as a first timer is underestimating their love for HOT. So I got the hot flavor of the Hot and Juicy sauce. My mouth was literally burning with fire, and I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce because the spice was taking over my taste buds. So if you are all for an inferno party in your mouth, I'd suggest the Hot  Hot and Juicy sauce.  My personal favorite is the less than mild Hot and Juicy sauce with all the right flavors with just the right amount of spice that I can handle baby! (ow ow!) Yes, it may not be on the menu, but there is a less than mild spice. The mild flavor still has a lot of kick in it so beware!   I also love the lemon pepper. If you love the tasty combination of citrus, tang, and spice, I would suggest the lemon pepper. It is also the safe zone. A flavor that is sure to satisfy you if you're not sure you're ready to take the risk and commitment of spice.  Lastly, this joint is worthy of five stars when you throw a corn in the cob and a potatoe in the plastic shake and bake bag (shake, DON't bake). Soak those bad boys up in that sauce baby, and call that a connection!   Its all about good food and experience and when you incorporate the thrill of eating off the table with no utensils or a plate (something your mother told you NEVER to do), you're sure to bring out the dangerous and adventurous side of yourself that you didn't know existed! Its a great place to take a date, especially if you want to test the daring side of them. I will be a long lived patron of Hot and Juicy. Hat tipped to you! :)  (Further update when I try my Boiling Crab experience....)",

    "text": "If you've been to Boiling Crab or Red Claw in Orange County, CA, then you'll find this place is fairly comparable - though maybe with much better service.  But honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (Ex: I was a big fan of Boiling Crab until I started going to Red Claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. Now I love Red Claw and think Boiling Crab is a bit too salty. Some may think Red Claw is too garlicky.  So it all depends. Red Claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to Red Claw now anyway.)    My husband and I were in Vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  Most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.  Since I love Boiling Crab and Red Claw, I was very excited to find this place on Yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  I found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.  So when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a Thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. But thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. We got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.  Okay, so while I was waiting, I noticed a few things.  1. The mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  I'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  The age range was also very wide - from young to old.  This was a great sign, as I noticed EVERYONE in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds. 2. It was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. No server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  If you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. This was honestly rare to see, and I was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.  As far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. The clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.  Shrimp - Mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).  Clams - Were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than I hoped they would be. I guess maybe they just use different clams than what I'm used to at Red Claw.  Sausage - Were not polska kielbasa sausages as we hoped. :( My husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves sausages.  Don't get these. Even though I ate them, I didn't enjoy them.  They were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.  Hot N Juicy sauce - This is similar to Boiling Crab's sauce.  I would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  My husband and I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at Boiling Crab.  Garlic sauce - We got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the Cajun garlic sauce at Red Claw (though Red Claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  My husband liked this sauce over the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is ironic since I'm usually more of the garlic lover.  Cajun fries - Fries sprinkled with Cajun seasoning.  The fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  The Cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  They were good fries. :)  Overall, this was definitely a great place for good Cajun-style seafood.   The service was great, and the food really good.  Overall, I'd definitely go here again the next time I'm in Vegas and craving seafood.  Be warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.  I suggest you keep jackets and sweaters in your car and wear something you don't mind stinking up.  You'll probably have to take a shower when you get home, unless you don't mind smelling the food on your hair and skin while sleeping. :)",

Not enough meat to justify the price. Ordered once and never again. - Why they don't serve a nice bread to sop up the intensely flavorful sauce is beyond my comprehension. - Shrimp are jumbo sized and a good option for first timers. - Wish they would serve a better quality rice as a side dish. - Prices are a bit steep, in particular for the catfish basket and calamari. Doesn't feel like a good value for such simple deep fried items.   Overall an enjoyable messy experience.",

It was spicy!!!! The lemon pepper clams were good as I like a bit of sour flavor. Two cajun crabs were yummy! One pound of each. Can tell I love seafood?! Lol  If you come here, make sure you come early. Parking is a pain. The place is in China Town on Spring Mt. Road (across from Tofu Hut) so, it is usually crowded. Parking somewhere down other restaurants is fine & then walk down to this place. This place is busy inside as well. So, plan accordingly!",

My friends, his cousin, our nieces all raved about Hot N Juicy so when we were planning a trip back to Vegas, it was definitely on our to do list.  We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and there were still plenty of parking. We were greeted right away and were taken to our seats. We were thankful as other reviews indicated that it could get busy. Keep in mind there are two locations in Chinatown Vegas.  The menu was easy to follow. We ordered a pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, sausage, and corn on the cob in Cajun style. It was scrumptious. The shrimp and crawfish weren't over cooked. It was seasoned well, flavoring was good, and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. It was rich and buttery goodness. Let the corn soak up all the sauce and then suck the juice and bite into it. Heavenly. You could even order a side of rice.   Our waitress was attentive and she refilled our drinks regularly. She was well mannered and positive. This was one meal that we enjoyed most in Vegas. It was such a great experience. A must visit when we return.",

The corn, the shrimp, it was all good. I really think it needed more sauce. Maybe my bag didn't have as much sauce as the other reviewers or maybe that's how it is here.   Maybe I'll try it again. There's one on Eastern, so I'll try that one. It is better than average, I just wasn't wowed.  Sorry folks",

The food took about 20 minutes to give to us. The shrimp was so good and we all enjoyed it. One of the people at our table had ordered snow crab and her food did not come until we were half way done with our food and she had to ask one of the waiters like \"I ordered snow crab and I don't have my food.\" The waiter gave her food to her in about 5 minutes.

Yet, I'm sitting here tonight to complain about their horrible customer service.   When I came here, my name was written down and I was told that it would be half an hour wait. Even after the half an hour mark, I insisted to my BF that sometimes servers are wrong on their wait time. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The server started to seat people based on the amount of people in the party rather than giving priority to who came first. You might ask how the heck I would know this, and the answer to this question is that a party of 6 who very obviously put their name down after mine were seated first.   Once we were seated, 57 minutes later, we waited another 15 for a server to even ask us what we would like.   Dear Hot N Juicy executives,   We all get busy. I get that. But some employees of yours need to be disciplined on the meaning of customer service. I might have not brought a large party, but that doesn't mean I didn't bring a big appetite.

Today I came in for lunch, usually my mom and I take to go. But today we decided to sit and dine in. As usual, the best sauce is hnj! Be easy on the spice as they run a little spicier than usual spices. We ordered clams and snow crab! For the snow crab you get about 4 to 7 legs. It's a hit and miss when it comes to getting clusters, unfortunately. Their clams can also vary. Some days they're huge and some days they're small. Larraine was our server. She was very sweet and patient with my mom ordering. She did not disappoint.   I'll forever keep coming back!",

I also dine in some time, the shrimp was better. Why?  Are you guys picking for bad shrimp for carry out and for dining in is the fresh one? Because dining in is easier to complain and you guys doesn't want that? Please dont do that. We pay the same price!! Stop cheated us!!",

    "text": "This restaurant had relatively quick servers. Unfortunately that was their only redeeming quality as the food was a big disappointment:(   Came here thinking I could get some delicious food from what I heard was great. Since it was very busy, I decided to order for take-out. Had 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp and a side order of sweet potato fries.   Service was alright but the food wasn't anything that I could even classify as good. Extremely cheap with their portions, barely got anything for the price I was paying. Not enough sauce to begin with. They put a few average size of crawfish on top to make them look good (tricky business???) Yesss it is!!! In reality all the ones at the bottom were so small, could have been the smallest crawfish of the year!!! Seriously:) They were very mushy and tasted rotten, most heads and claws fell off. Shrimp was even worst, had a mushy taste to it again with heads broken off. Obviously they must have been frozen for so long. Fries were also as bad, limp, soggy and over browned. I didn't have any luck with this place at all, ended up throwing them out.  For the prices of being charged I would have expected some fresh delicious food but very disappointed. A total waste of money and a bad experience all around.",

    "text": "So just before leaving the country on Holiday, I absolutely had to have one of my favorite types of cuisine: The Cajun Seafood Boil.    This review may end up being a little bit long winded BUT filled with pertinent information for anyone that is considering visiting this fine establishment.   Our experience here was amazing from the time that you walk into the establishment, there is the imminent smell of fresh seafood and as you look around, they are smiling and stuffed faces.    I was eager to join the party. We were seated fairly quickly, after noticing that this place was packed ! We were immediately given binbs and gloves. Eric was polite and  after we chose to share The Drool ( 1 lb shrimp , 1 lb crawfish,  .5 lb snow crab legs,  calamari appetizer, sausage, 2 corn, 2 potatoes $50.99) 5/5 and he suggested that we try the Cajun calamari 5/5( definitely spicy) vs regular fried calamari as in appetizer.  Additionally,  we had a dozen raw oysters served with a cocktail sauce and horseradish. 4.5/5 ( One of my few suggestions is to add a vinegar based sauce for the oysters. I have had this served in establishments and it really gives an amazing taste and acidity.)   Now the boil..omg..it was huge and finger licking good weighing in at 5 to 7 pounds and O. M. G. the flavors (spice level Medium + House Blend seasoning) have definitely been perfected. For the crawfish, suck the head and squeeze the tail! I got down and dirty with this food! Zero Regrets.   Although the table is plastic lined, I think that it would be nice to bring out a large bowl to put shells and other inedible parts in.    The rest rooms were clean but I would suggest that they increase the water pressure at the sinks to blast that seafood smell away from fingers.  Price: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Smells: 5/5 Experience: 6/5  TL;DR: Eat here !",

In that time I've crisscrossed this great country 3 times on long road trips. Nothing compares.   Their food is great, sometimes I do catfish, sometimes the oysters, both are amazing, but I always get the etoufee. For those of you that don't know it's basically a crawfish stew over rice. Then to the goodies, 2 pounds of hot and juicy crawfish (gotta get 2 so you get the corn and potatoes), a pound or 2 of shrimp done the same way, sometimes clams lemon pepper, sometimes snow crab legs, but always the crawfish and shrimp.   Their shrimp are huge, easy to peel, and fresh. So fresh that you can pull them out of the shell without removing the last 2 or 3 segments closest to the tail. Crawfish will either be frozen or fresh, but even the frozen crawfish are amazing and you probably won't even be able to tell.   Everything here is amazing and addictive. Once you've had a taste, nothing else will do. If you come during peak hours, be prepared to wait for an hour or 2. I've found it best to come in the late afternoon or later in the evening.",

Of snow crab, 2 potatoes and 2 ears of corn, and fried cajun calamari)and we also added another pound of snow crabs and corn fritters (they dont have hushpuppies) all in garlic butter sauce and mild heat. Everything was served hot but I felt the shrimp were overcooked.  The cajun calamari was by far my favorite. The spices were perfect.  Note: this place gets packed around dinner time and the bar only serves fried baskets. So you have to wait on table to enjoy the juicy part of Hot and Juicy.",

I'm not the biggest spice lover but the mild was great towards the end of the bag it was a little bit spicier but no complaints!

It's probably not a good idea to go out clubbing after eating here though, because your breath will be kickin with garlic and you might make someone hungry by the smell of your burps. Even if you change clothing, you'll still reek of garlic. Trust me, I've been in this situation LOL. Be sure to put on some gloves too!   I love that they offer combos here and that their sauces are actually spicy! You can choose from shrimp, clams, mussels, crab (Snow, dungeness, and king) served by the pound that you'll peel yourself. My favorite sauce is the hot n juicy mix in spicy or extra spicy if I'm feeling brave. There are also chicken wings and fries and fried catfish baskets or calamari if shellfish isn't your thing.",

    "text": "Hot N Juicy Crawfish was always a maybe to try for me because I've heard so many mixed reviews that I didn't want to be disappointed. But I'm an elite, it's my job to eat and try everything. After our hour long foot massage we decided to try this place.   The place was actually quite small and there was no place to sit and wait. But there was a shaved ice place that was next door, where we waited until they text us when our seats were ready. Which I absolutely love. When you get a number or when they text you your seats ready. It's convenient and smart.   With 5 people ahead of us, our wait wasn't that long at all. Right off the bat we ordered a dozen oysters, chicken wings, and Cajun fries. 2 lbs of shrimp: Hot N Juicy flavor extra spicy (it's a mixture of flavors) and 2 lbs of clam Hot N Juicy flavor spicy. For dessert we ordered the deep fried brownie.   The oysters were ok. It tasted very watery. But that's better than fishy. The Cajun fries were very spicy, and without us choosing a flavor. The wings were plain fried wings with a side of ranch. The flavor for our shrimp and clams were really good. It was so good. It literally was like an explosion of flavor and the spice did not over power the flavor of the food at all. The brownies were battered and sprinkled with powder sugar. Honestly you can't go wrong with deep fried dessert.   Service was friendly. Waters were filled when an employee would walk around with a pitcher but it was hard to tell because waters are put in a styrofoam cup. Servers would come around and ask if we were ok. Normal waitress duties.   I would definitely come back to Hot N Juicy when I come back to Vegas.",

I could probably drink it like soup or eat it with just rice. I take back the first part, but I could do just rice with the seasoning haha. The seasoning is super savory and buttery with a hint of sweetness to it. It's absolutely perfect.   I usually get 1-1.5 lbs of shrimp (depending on how hungry I am) Hot n Juicy seasoning mild with two sides of rice and a catfish platter. I tried the medium spicy twice and ended up being miserable the next morning on both occasions. Never again, because my stomach's becoming a pussy.   Service has always been quick and accommodating. Will be back here if I ever need to satisfy my cajun cravings.",

But, even \"less than mild\" has a little kick to it and doesn't affect me so, perfect!  I usually order corn and sausage, with the shrimp, then a side of rice or sweet potato fries.  Every time I'm in Vegas I try to drop by.  I look forward to it every time now.  Great place.  Not a long wait at all, and the waitresses are super friendly.",

    "text": "Hot N Juicy Special comin right up!  I just came back from Las Vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and I managed to make it out to Hot N Juicy in Chinatown. My friends heard of it from Man vs. Food and I thought the pictures on Yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. We go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. Of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. We ordered the calamari, two orders of sweet potato fries, a half-dozen raw oysters, two pounds of the Hot and Juicy crawfish, one pound of the lemon pepper crawfish and three pounds of the garlic butter crawfish (my personal favorite).   The calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. It comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. Now I am not a fan of sweet potato fries, but my friends ordered two orders, I was bound to try one. Not only did I try ONE, I tried like ELEVEN! Haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. Believe it or not, I would order them again. (Zoinks?! lol). The raw oysters were so fresh it melted in my mouth. My only complaint is that I usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when I shoot raw oysters and all they had was lemon. But none the less, MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS!!! The guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. All the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. However, the garlic butter was my absolute favorite, and I think everyone elses' as well. Mainly because we put in an order for two MORE pounds after killin' just the one.   *BTW you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the Hot and Juicy special at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. Even to my spicy-loving Thai mates that ate with me :).  I only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. I'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar.",

I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish hot and juicy style mild medium and spicy as well as 2 pounds of shrimp garlic butter seasoning.  All i can say is everything had a good kick of a flavor.  The restaurant aroma was lingering in the air as soon i stepped inside.  All the garlic burned my eyes with passion :).. Okay so we got the food home as soon as possible to try and taste it.  So i tore open the bags and noticed that there were about 4-5 large crawfish  and rest were pretty petite.  By the way there were 3 of us and we finished the shrimp as well as two bags of the crawfish.  The  taste was great as i expected.  I would definitely return for more when i am in town.",

What I like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as lemon pepper, house special, cajun style, and one other I can't remember.  They give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  The cajun fries are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  The medium spiciness has some kick to it.  They have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  The service was good, but maybe it was because I went for lunch at a non-busy time.  The prices are just a dollar more than California, but it's still worth it.",

You walk into this quaint little restaurant. and there's a bunch of tables, some of them are dressed with plastic covering...Oh yes.

I had to get the nosebleed(Ok not on the menu) - Yes this spice was definitely a creeper. But it wasn't nosebleed enough for me. They had a special of crawfish etouffe which was good but not enough heat.  When the crawfish come....well normally in Louisiana they're steamed in a water broth. The crawfish here....are put in a bag....with butter....garlic, spices, etc...Yea. WTF Talk about a cholesterol issue. Good luck with that! BUT IT'S SO FREAKING GOOD. I ordered two lbs...It was tedious having to pick out the meat. The crawfish this time wasn't as big as I was used to - but still good. I needed I definitely liked the sausage too! I couldn't finish it though....I wanted rice and I talked to one of the guys...definitely will try to incorporate rice or bread to the menu.  I did have to knock them for the portions of rice only because it felt like I was being rationed off on Survivor. I can't wait to go back. But this time - I'd like my crawfish shelled :)",

WHAT?!?!? this place says hot and juicy CRAWFISH in the name...hwo can you run out??? -1 ok...so we were debating whether or not to stay, but we did make the trip off the strip to come here (yes..we came a long way..haha) so we decided to stay. we ordered 2lbs of shrimp, and one dungeoness crab, fries, corn, susage....all hot and juicy special, spicy. i also wanted etouffee, but they ran out of that as well! UGH. so we settled for bowl of rice -_-  well when the food came, it was prety good and spicy. well let me tell you, normall yi would have gotten 2lbs of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp, and that would have been enough for 2 people, but since there were no crawfish, we ordered 2lbs of shrimp and one crab... 2lbs of shrimp..is TOO much for 2 people. 1lb would have been sufficient.  anyways, the foods was pretty tasty, but i cant help but compare it to boiling crab in california...which i love..and i think it tastes better...and they dont ever run out of crawfish... -.5   so...yea....thats about it.",

    "text": "Yup, I was one of the many people who saw this place on Man vs. Food. I came on a weekday around 5pm to avoid the crowds. This place gets really busy around 7 and on the weekends. I got 2 pounds of crawfish and a side of fries. Came out close to 30 bucks. Not a bad deal. I think the only problem when I ate the crawfish was that my fingers smelled for quite a while and you will surely smell like garlic so if you plan to go on a date, bring some mints, mouthwash and prepare to take a shower when you get back to your room. But you know what, it;s worth it.",

The service was fast and friendly, the place smells amazing, and the food was great. I recommend the Hot and Juicy special seasoning, it was all buttery and garlicky, two of the best things on the planet if you ask me. The girlfriend was a little sad that crawfish was out of season, but she said the frozen ones were almost as good as the fresh, and they were a lot cheaper too!",

It's also packed!  Lot's of spice choices on the menu, lot's of variety of mud-bugs, crustaceans, shellfsh and such.  Also lots of sides, in Southern Style.  It can be messy, so if you take a date here make sure it's like your guys 20th date or so.  Because your hands are going to be covered in hot spices (even with the gloves) and it's a pretty messy/smelly affair, great...but messy.  I never tried it at the other location but I was more than pleased with this one.  The wait staff is awesome, more than willing to make sure you are okay and need anything, they are on top of it, even if they aren't your server they are checking on everyone.  If you have been wishy-washy in the past, don't dally any longer, this place rocks!",

    "text": "Mmm Hot & Juicy!  Indeed!  I came here for a bachelorette party in the summer.  I took the bachelorette to Hot & Juicy as we waited for the other bridesmaids to arrive.  There was a long line of people waiting outside.  It was a Thursday night.  The staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  I wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  By the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  I've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   The bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the Hot & Juicy special sauce, garlic fries, and I ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   They all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  We received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  I guess we didn't order enough food?  My buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  I couldn't eat it.  I just wanted boiled corn and they said I had to be more specific.  You had to say boil corn or something.  My waiter was horrible.  He wasn't that attentive.  He gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  My 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  I was super disappointed.  I love corn too!   Ah, did I forget to mention that I had to ask where my corn was?  He had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  He didn't even apologize for forgetting.  He just brought out that soggy salty corn.  Anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  The crawfish was fresh.  All the shells were hard and not soft.  So that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  The flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  It was definitely a finger licking experience.  For the two of us, 1 lb each on shrimps and crawfish was enough.  I don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish I can eat a lot of.  I'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  It was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm definitely coming back.  We have a Crawfish King in Seattle and I do not like that place at all.  I'll do a review on that place later.",

    "text": "For the longest time I grappled with  leaving a review or to not.  After hearing so many great things about Hot N Juicy from friends, family and chef's I was really looking forward to this place!!  I knew what it was all about before I got there.  Rolling up yer sleeves and gettin down n' dirty with pound bags of some critters of the sea......  We heeded the warnings of early yelpers and went at an off time so we didn't have to wait an hour.  We ordered crawdads, crab and shrimp.  I had never had crawfish to eat before but I had caught these lil buckaroos as a kid when my ADD would leave me catching critters in the lakes I was fishing in INSTEAD of watching my fishing pole. I was not a fan of my first crawfish experience but I don't hold that against Hot N Juicy , probably just wasn't for me.  The shrimp were average and the king crab legs were good.  The hardest thing for me reviewing Hot N Juicy was it might just not be for me.  The concept is cool but after my experience I don't want my seafood to be masked with a flavor of garlic and chile for lbs on end.  I want to taste the natural sweetness, or flavor of freshly squeezed lemon juice and allow the protein to be in the spotlight it deserves.  My two star rating isn't for the cuisine here though.  I realize it just wasn't for me.  I was more disappointed and left unsure of the cleanliness of the dining room.  I am not a neat-freak.... I knew going into this that it was dirty.  I was not expecting the table fun to extend to the walls of the restaurant though.  We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant that during the time of our dining had direct sunlight on the wall.  That entire wall was the spotlight of 100 different greasy, juicy paw prints that made it look like kids finger painting with crisco.  It actually pains me to leave a negative review of a restaurant that gets so many rave reviews from fellow yelpers.  Cleanliness needs to be improved dramatically.  Hot N Juicy needs to get Hot and Soapy......",

    "text": "I would give this place 6 stars if there's an option. It's right off the strip you'll need to take the cab there. It's never busy in the day time ( not sure about at night). My 1st time eating crawfish was at this place few years ago but never gotten a chance to write a review about it. Ate  there like 2 times while was in vegas.  I still hear good reviews from family members and friends who just got back from there recently this year. This place is the reason I became obsessed with those little critters. There were pics of celebrities on the wall who also ate here. NICE!  The environment is decent looking and the service was good and acceptable. There's always plenty of paper towels around and bathrooms are clean. Anyone who hasn't tried it should give it a try. It's worth every penny. Come on now... it has to be that good to make it on the food channel and travel channel. I think man vs food made the right choice. Boiling crab just isn't buttery and hot enough for a  challenge.   Below is a little  review comparison between Hot n Juicy special sauce vs boiling crab whole sha-bang sauce. I've been to boiling crab about 8 times now in SJ and 1 time in anaheim and it is so far  the best in CA. I usually order 6 lbs.  I read some reviews here from others who had tried Hot N Juicy crawfish and I have to completely disagree with them calling this place a duplicate or copy cat of boiling crab. They should go get their taste buds checked. Hot N Juicy is 5x buttery/stickier and a bit sweeter but they do have xtra spicy as an option. Their sauce will leave your fingers smelling for days that's how good it is.  Boiling crab on the other hand has that smokey taste and their spice is acceptable. I normally order xtra spice.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas except for the smell it follows you home. Hot n juicy crawfish still remains #1 as my favorite place. 5+ stars from me for their awesome delicious foods.Boiling crab is right behind it unless Red Crawfish in SF can knock it to 3rd place. Red crawfish will be my next stop.",

Also two Heinekens, a bowl of white rice and a side of sweet potato fries.  If you order at least 2 lbs of one kind of shellfish you'll get a corn cob and potato included with your order. The total bill came out to about $60 -- not cheap.  The food was OK, not great.  I prefer my shelfish seasonings to have a bit of citrus tang to it, which was lacking here.  I believe lemon wedges are available if you ask for them, but otherwise your server won't offer them to you.  The restaurant decor seemed a bit out of sync for this style of eating which was very casual.  Very small parking lot out front -- we had to circle around the block a few times to find parking.  If there is a next time we'll park across the street at the Chinatown strip mall and walk over.",

    "text": "Sorry people but im going to have to be the fly in the ointment here. I got a chance to go to Hot and Juicy last weekend to see what all the hub bub was all about. And yes I saw it on Man V Food and it looked interesting. All the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. Well I walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. The girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. I was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. She made the crawfish sound so good I caved and ordered a pound of them. I also ordered a pound of the king crab and some sausage. My mom ordered the fried shrimp and frys.      The girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. I ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that I was really in for a treat. Well I have come to a conclusion, THERES NOTHING EDIBLE ON CRAWFISH!!! These things fought me every step of the way. I worked my ass off just to get a \"TINNY\" piece of tale meat. The waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. I would hate the see the regular ones. The flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. I went with the hot and juicy special medium. The sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. I ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.     Now the shrimp was another issue. I am not a big fan of whole shrimp. I dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. If they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. I didnt eat allot of them because of this. The crab legs were pretty good but I should have ordered the same sauce instead of the garlic butter.      Hot and Juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. I dont think I will be coming but though. I do wish them the best.",

    "text": "Wow this was as close to home( New Orleans ) as you can get here in Las Vegas. I will start by saying please don't let the location stop you from visiting this restaurant. I live in Henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. It is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. The food is simple to order its all by the pound. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (Our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and juicy special sauce. They tasted great but if you want more of the Louisiana taste get the 2ND sauce I think it is called Juicy Cajun. We also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), Oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but I think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it I thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). There is more on the menu but all I could try this visit. I will return for sure the food is really that good. I put $$$ for the price because I ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.Please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. The service was very friendly. Thank you to everyone for your reviews. It was the reason I had to try it.  Went back for some live blue crab and everything was as good as the 1st time. The blue crab is now my favorite. The bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. I know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try.",

After several trips, I've come to learn my favorite flavors and spice ratings. I love the hot n juicy special at a mild or medium level. These levels have a good amount of spice that doesn't hurt my face.  Now, I'm not a very good spicy food eater. But I have been here with different groups of friends and have had the opportunity to sample the different spice levels. I can say the extra spicy is very very hot, and it builds with every bite you take. Your lips continue to burn, but you can't resist the tastiness and continue to eat, despite the pain. But what I really like and appreciate about the extra spicy flavors is the fact that you can still taste the flavor despite the heat. Your mouth isn't reduced to just a ball of fire.  And on that note, I would recommend any seafood lover to visit this fine establishment.",

When you pass by the restaurant in China Town, it appears to be a shady massage parlor or some kind of strip joint!!  But when you walk through the doors, AMAZING!  Don't try to make reservations, this place gets too crowded for this.  And if you want to test out a new date, definitely bring 'em here.  This will determine if they like to get \"down and dirty\" or if they have a problem digging in and eatin' a real good meal.   Prepare to have your sinuses cleared.  Don't count on having good conversation, you'll be too busy scarfing down yummy food.  Everything about this place is great.  The customer service is SOOOO GOOD.  Almost all the servers are real friendly (and there are some that have been there a long time which is great).  The atmosphere (music could use a little help) is perfect for a fun group dinner (New Orlean's style).

Everything was delicious but the king crab legs are fantastic. We were talking about the food for days after.  The wait staff were friendly and able to handle a rowdy bunch of guys. You may want to arrive by cab because I don't think there is much in the way of parking. To help offset the wait time check out Crown & Anchor bar across the street.",

    "text": "Hot n' Juicy is an old favorite of mine located on Spring Mountain between Decatur and Jones. Hot n' Juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. Sometimes when I give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. Besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. How can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and Cajun seasonings?  Today I ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). We both asked for the Hot n' Juicy special seasoning, extra spicy! You are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - Louisiana Style, Juice Cajun, Garlic Butter, or Lemon Pepper. Besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, or shrimp.  The first time I had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. I remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. At Hot n' Juicy it's a little different, but not much. You are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. They bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. When you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. This is where the fun starts. Crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. First you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. Then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. If this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. They supply you with crab crackers, but Ian and I agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. Whatever you decide to get, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  If you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the Cajun fries ($2.99). These came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. We managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. Who would have thought that you could make French fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? I guess Europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so I don't feel too guilty or out of line.  By the time you are finished, it looks like Hurricane Katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. This is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try Hot n' Juicy almost any other time.",

I got 1 lb. of shrimp with the hottest seasoning there was available I believe it was cajun and the corn drenched in the seasoning was SO delicious!!! I got salt & pepper, squeezed lemon juice and dipped my shrimp in it and ahhhhh enjoyed it to the fullest so good I had to order another lb. of shrimp lol.... Thankfully our wait wasn't bad we were seated right away but I did notice a little after there was a line of people waiting.. Service was GREAT. The waitress was friendly, helpful & informative. Prices were good for 1 lb. of shrimp about $10, sides such as corn or rice i want to say were $2... Overall a GREAT experience and can't wait for the W. Hollywood location to open since it's closer to me... You have to try HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!!!",

Although last night, the craw fish didn't taste good since it was \"California\" craw fish instead of Louisiana craw fish. It had a fishy smell and the shell was harder than usual. The head had this white stringy thing that lead to the back so it was gross to see and eat it. Other than that, the sauce is really good! I would definitely come back but I would order the Lousiana craw fish this time. Overall, I had a pleasant experience once again.",

We often get shrimp and snow crab with either lemon pepper or hot n' juicy sauces. It's so much fun just getting down and dirty while eating seafood laden with garlicky goodness.

I actually really like this place. The spices they use in their signature Hot-N-Juicy is off the hook, much better than Crawdaddy (in San Jose) and right up there if not better than Boiling Crab (in San Jose). We ordered the King Crab Legs in butter and garlic and Hot-N-Juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, Shrimp in Hot-N-Juicy in medium also, Cajun Fries, Sweet Potato Fries and Corn on the Cob and Potatoes! I love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have potatoes either. They also have blue crab here which the ones in San Jose don't have. Can't wait to go here again!  The service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and I had to keep asking for water. But all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. Get there early because I hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!",

The crawfish were pretty small when I ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. The shrimp and crab legs were better though. I liked the hot n juicy special medium (which was super spicy the first time I came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the lemon pepper mild. Sweet potato fries were awesome as well. The cajun fries were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. Beers are cheap.  Definitely a fun eating experience as well. I would recommend the trip if you are in Vegas.",

We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish to share between my wife and I, which would have come to about $23 at current market price.  When the waiter dropped off my bag it seemed unusually beefy, and when he returned with the wife's shrimp, it too seemed large.  I asked him if these were one pound bags and he replied, \"No, two pounds each.\".  I told him we didn't order 2 pounds of each, just one, and he basically just shrugged his shoulders at us as if to say, \"Oh well, you've got em now.\" and walked away.  I had to get up and go track him down to explain to him that I did not want that much food and did not want to spend $50 on lunch and that he needed to figure out another option.  He came back to our table and picked up our food, then returned with the proper amounts.  The food itself was OK, not great as other reviews state.  Crawfish seemed on the tiny side, and many of the shrimp were a bit overcooked and mushy.  Flavor was tasty though, we had the mild Hot N Juicy seasoning.  This place wasn't worth the drive from the hotel for us, but maybe we just caught them on a bad day.  I would say this place is worth a shot, but I really can't recommend it based on my one and only visit.",

Later, i will regret, because I will have a dragon breath burping for the next few hours. It's totally worth it though.   All the seafood is sold by the pound, except for shrimp which you can get minimum of 1/2lb.   Dont forget to wear the plastic gloves provided. (if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). To avoid long lines, I usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack.   For the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is TSA approved as carryon. I guess the sauce is not considered liquid. I've flown with Hot n Juicy for about 3 times with no problem. Make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!",

This place maybe located off the strip but it shouldn't be off your radar, in fact, our whole group was so stoked to go here we decided a party bus was the only way to go.  We arrived VIP style only to find out that even VIPs had to wait too -- this is a first come, first served basis -- which means 45 mins. wait for our party of 13 on a Friday night.  We were absolutely starving by the time we got seated.  I was excited to see my Hot N Juicy mild 2 lb. crawfish come to the table.  It was served steaming hot in a plastic bag and it includes potato and corn.  It certainly lived up to its name, I was sweating bullets and constantly reaching for my cup of water -- 3 COLD cups -- to tame the hotness in my mouth.  I was with a bunch of Thai folks so you know they have had their share of SPICY food growing up and even they were crying!  but of course, they didn't listen to our server when she warned them, so they ordered it HOT anyway and boy, I saw grown men in tears!  A solid four stars for the taste, for the experience of getting down and dirty and for such great friendly service.  However, my two pounds of crawfish even with a side of Cajun fries (also spicy!) still left me craving for more substantial food.  The damage came up to $31 with tip which is pricey indeed but I guess this leaves room in your tummy for the after party!",

    "text": "I have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. However, I have never REALLY wanted to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish because I am kind of like a cat, LOL. I don't like messy eating and if I am going to go out and pay for my food, I prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what I mean.   The in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. We arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. We had no luck with parking. The parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street.   My husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: blue crab, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish.   Their opinions: - the shrimp and catfish were the best - the crawfish required too much work for too little meat - the crab was very hard to take apart - \"mild\" was still pretty spicy  I ordered the fried shrimp and sweet potato fries. I know, boring right? The fried shrimp wasn't very good. I think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. After eating 2 pieces, I didn't want anymore. The sweet potato fries were standard, nothing special.   I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I would come back again because I didn't enjoy it too much. However, I will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. Service was friendly and attentive. We even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.  Just a few tips: - DO NOT wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty! -Remember to take a shower and do laundry ASAP because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! Skin, hair, clothes, everything!",

They have other items on the menu like chicken wings/fingers, etc but why go there for that?  You want crawfish and shrimp!  When I meet a girl with nice nails, this is the place I like to take her because when you have the shrimp or crawfish your hands and fingers will get yummy messy!  While peeling your shrimp you can feel free to use the your table as the plate to put your shrimp skin or crawfish shell!  Wearing the bib is a must!!",

    "text": "The only time I eat a pound plus of food is when I come here! My favorite thing to get is the One Pound bag of Shrimp, Hot N Juicy Special flavor, Extra Spicy. I've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. They also have clams, oysters, crab legs, french fries, sweet potato fries, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings.   In my opinion, this location by Decatur, is better than the one off of Valley View or off Eastern.  If you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. My \"system\" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. I also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so I don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. After I put my plastic bib on, I put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. After I'm done eating, I put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands.   Anyway, the food is really good. Everything is tasty. Service is always pretty decent. Whenever I need my fix, I come here!",

I highly recommend you wear extra gloves instead of just the one pair. The lobster was a very good size for the price. If I could have only one negative complaint, it would be that the lobster price said by pound on the menu. However they had only purchased whole lobsters that day so you had to buy the whole lobster for double the pound price. The seafood was fresh and I will definitely be going back!!",

Good because you can be helped by the server who is closest to you no matter who they are, and bad because you don't really have a set server for your table checking in on you as often.

Of course I had to bring my hungry ass to check this place out myself :)  Went along with my friends/RETURN customers yesterday (monday) haha and luckily there was no wait because apparently I've heard that they would have a 2 hr wait time...woah. Got seated to our table and I scanned the whole place out... it's actually nice inside. Not a fancy nice, but nice as in a chill laid back vibe. Being that it was my first time, I told the server what is \"normal\" for myself to \"CONSUME\" lol (food served in pounds). And she mentioned 1lb is normal for 1 person. She suggested the HOT N' JUICY SPECIAL, shrimp or crawfish. I picked shrimp. then there's a choice of how spicy you want it - Medium, Spicy, or Extra Spicy. Personally I love spicy food! I was thinking extra spicy! but then the server was saying that sometimes going extra spicy takes away the flavor of the food... and of course I didn't want THAT to happen haha.   Food arrives! got the napkins in place, my cup of water, and the infamous crawfish bib on.....now my game face starts! lol. Overall, the shrimp was definitely JUICY being soaked in with all the spice n' garlic! Spice level was perfect for me, although I should of tried the extra spicy too see how dangerous they seem to sound. Always next time.   BTW, I was not able to finish the lb. of shrimp I ordered since I had to peel the skin off one by one! I got full quicker because I ate slow!! FML! haha. This place is one spot you would want to come to if you need some livin la vida loca in your life!! haha",

    "text": "Growing up some of my good friends were Louisiana Creole, and every so often they'd fly in crawfish from Louisiana and cook it right there in their backyard. So I've been wanting to check out Hot N Juicy since I moved to Vegas, but I tend to think of it as a communal eating experience that requires at least a small group. I finally had my chance last weekend when my aunt and cousin came into town with their friends.   For 5 people (four women, one man) we ordered 3 lbs of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, a dozen sausages, and one corn and potato for each person, all cooked in the Hot N Juicy house seasonings (as recommended by the waitress when we couldn't decide). The first time you go to a restaurant like this it is hard to know what spice level to choose. We had a mixed group so we played it safe by getting everything mild and asking for a medium sauce on the side. I can handle spicy pretty well, and I think the mild was perfect if you just want to enjoy the flavor of the food with a small amount of kick for the authentic Cajun taste. Granted, the shrimp hold the spice much better than the crawfish (since you get such a small amount of meat out of crawfish). I think that if I came here with just my husband, we'd probably opt for medium level spice since he puts hot sauce or salsa on everything!!  Know before you go: There are no plates. You are served all your food in plastic bags (to hold in the juices) right on your table which is covered with paper and supplied with plastic gloves and a roll of napkins. You are also given a bib to wear, and you'll need it!!! It is a messy and time consuming meal (for the infrequent crawfish eater) but once you get over getting \"down and dirty\" at dinner, it is well worth it!!",

    "text": "Omg so many coworker and even my hairstyle told me about this place! So i finally decided to go on a Friday after work. I LOVED IT!! I don't want to sound like a total fatty BUT I was in heaven the whole time focused on my bag of crab!  The moment you open the bag of yummiest this amazing aroma hits you in your face, and you will just like i knew, it was about to go down!Everything was amazing. I ordered the snow crab with the  spicy hot and juicy seasoning; I was told it was the best and most popular, so of course I wanted to try that one first. The extras were very favorable with the hot and juicy seasoning and  is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,  potatoes(.60 cent), sausage(1/2 dozen 2.45) and corn( i believe .75) . I now know  any other sides or anything extra aren't needed. I ordered a side of butter( which is a dollar extra) and didn't even touch it.   Also important: the customer service was great! Everyone was so nice and smiled with their service. HUGE plus for me! Last comment, I suggest that whenever you go don't come all dressed up because although this meal is  incredible it can also be very messy, which is the reason for the commentary bid and gloves that are given. All im saying is don't come to this place thinking you'll be going somewhere nice after because you will be leaving smelling like hot and juicy, and maybe a little sauce on your clothes.  I really hope your experience is as enjoyable as my experience!",

Once we were seated, we ordered sweet potato fries,  the fried catfish basket, 1 pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, both with the Hot n' Juicy sauce.    The hot and juicy sauce lacked flavor, we literally had to add salt to it  to liven it up.  The sweet potatoes fries were not crispy, and the catfish had way too much batter.

It's not ideal for large groups although they accommodated our party of 27. Our second waitress, a petite African American lady, was amazing. Our primary waitress was average and never followed up on several things we asked (such as whether they had grey goose available -which cost them a potential drink purchase) but I will let that slide since we had such a large party. The space is nice and the location is convenient although hard to find. My greatest complaint is that when I called the restaurant to notify them that we would be coming with a large party (I had already read on yelp that they didn't take reservations), the rude woman that answered the phone informed me that she would t be setting aside any space and that we probably wouldn't sit together and that they would even seat us until everyone was there. I have absolutely no problem with the rules of the establishment but rather the impolite way in which she said everything! As a business representative you NEVER turn away money and especially 30 people worth of money! I almost went to pampas instead! When we arrived, that same rude woman greeted us with the same flip attitude and had it not been for the 3 other people we dealt with that were polar opposites of her, this review would have been much different! That blonde haired woman alone could have made me never come back again.",

The food was fantastic. We tried the shrimp and crawfish in HNJ and garlic butter, both were great! The different sauces had good flavor, but beware of how spicy they can be. I love hot food, but the mild was too hot for me, I was sweating and nose dripping from the heat. I would suggest moving one hot level down to be safe. Be prepared to use your hands to eat or plastic gloves over your hands to eat. There are no plates or silverware. Most of the food comes in plastic bags and you eat on top of a clean plastic covered table. The only negative was the parking situation. The lot in front of the business is very small. We initially parked down the street but during the wait for a table a spot opened up so we moved. All the adjacent business parking have signs saying they will tow if you are not a customer of their business.",

That is good enough and convincing to me. I mean come on people, its not featured on Man vs Food on the Food Network for nothing you know.",

Ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (so I can get corn and potato), mild spicy-ness and hot and juicy flavoring. Mmmm-mmmm-mmm! Delish.  Do expect to get your hands dirty. Use a spoon to scoop out some of that deliciousness of juice onto your crawfish (after peeled). But expect the service to be just okay. They forgot to get me my bucket of calamari.  For the price, it's aight. Kinda expensive but hey, it's still good. Why 3 stars? 1. they need to expand and 2. service needs to be good or better.",

    "text": "This is an updated review from my 2011 original review; the location is the newly open restaurant that is up the street from the original Hot N Juicy location.  Parking is still a bit tricky but definitely more space.  Crawfish are still a bugger to eat, it is fun sucking and slurping up the juice that marinades the crawfish.  Once you have accomplish all the sucking and slurping, you are rewarded with the tiniest meat but it is all so worth it!  My suggestion is go in a group so you are able to order in bulk and try everything! Ordering steps are pretty easy; it takes 3 steps to order you scrumptious crustacean.  Step one, order your seasoning, step 2, order the hotness of your seasoning and step three, order your crustacean!  Now it's not just a crawfish place, they offer lobster, crabs, shrimps and clams.  So don't get put off because of the crawfish, there's other crustacean for you to choose from.   The wait is still the same, first come first serve!  No reservation and be patient.  But the wait is so worth it!  P.S. Be prepare to get a little dirty, so don't wear your church whites or \"date\" clothes; come prepare to get stained a bit! ;)",

We got our food but wrong order one of our dishes, annoyed. Went ahead and ate our food but she only checked up on us just once and can't locate her to get our gloves and extra lemon peppers, so we went and serve ourselves. Food , I think the chef is on vacation...it lacks flavors. I left a bitter flavor in my mouth with the whole experience.

It is hot and juicy, as the restaurant name suggests, and damn delicious.   The servers all bear a striking resemblance to Suicide Girls except without the attitude problem. I wish I remembered our girl's name, as she was super friendly and helpful, and even put on some gloves and demonstrated how to most efficiently peel our crawfish for the newbs at the table.  Ordered the crawfish, shrimp, and sausage (which should definitely be combined!) all in the special Hot and Juicy seasoning, medium level, which combines all of their flavors and was amazing. We also went through a basket of crispy cajun fries and added on some crab legs, but I don't remember what kind.  As with most restaurants that serve by the pound, this place can get pricey if you're not careful, but it is so tasty you'll pull out your wallet without a second thought.",

    "text": "Found this joint only because of Yelp -- so thanks, guys!  Took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...  Our first impression was that on a Friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.     The four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \"hot n juicy\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  Word to the wise, I was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \"tendertongue\" with us... Maybe I'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  First you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.     We ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)  We thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  They were out of dungeness and blue crabs tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.  The 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...We ended up ordering another pound for him and the cajun fries for us...really good crispy fries, too.  We girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...I'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  And they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.    Service was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?    Beware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the Strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on Spring Mt before you reach Decatur.  Then the easiest way to get back to Henderson is to take Decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on Decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...  We'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.    Our total bill came to $70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, cajun fries, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than I'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.  (Naturally, we stopped at Sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)  Fun Friday!",

You have to be willing to dig in and get intimate with your bag o' stuff...whether it's crawfish or shrimp.  I love spicy food, but the mild sauce is plenty spicy. I can't imagine really going for a higher heat level. But the sauce is finger licking good. And if you're into making your own soup stock, take those tiny carcasses home and make some of the best seafood stock you've ever had.

    "text": "I'm a BIG crawfish fan back at home in Norcal, so coming here I was ready to try Vegas crawfish. I came with a party of 14 and surprisingly got seated right away. Service was kind of slow, we literally had to flag down the waitress to ask for gloves and more lemons. Then when the bill came out there was a minor mix-up. Anyways the crawfish tastes a lot like Boiling Crab except with a more lemongrass flavor to it. Not bad at all. I deducted 1 star for the dozen raw (and runny) oysters we ordered that tasted gross and not fresh at all. So when you order try to stick to crawfish or else u would get a nasty old oyster taste in your mouth. The shrimp was meaty and juicy just perfectly done. We boxed our leftovers to bring back to our hotel and it still tastes great after we microwave it. Definitely a win!",

Either way I freakin' smelled of garlic for days.  I can eat pretty spicy stuff but anything over the medium here... is FIRE to me. Expect to drink a lot of water or beer with your meal. When it's that spicy, your tongue just dies and there's nothing subtle to pick up about flavors, it's just pain.  Service was very average. It might as well have been a server from a casino buffet giving us our drinks. Don't expect much from the atmosphere either. There ain't nothing pretty about this place.  Though it's not a place to come for amazing food or service, I still come back occasionally because I find myself craving the salt and the garlic. :)",

They cover the table with a plastic tablecloth and have complimentary crawfish bibs to wear to protect your clothes. I think it's worthwhile trying the crawfish at least once!   We tried a few other things from the menu including snow crab (this was awesome), blue crab (skip this altogether) king crab, shrimp (definitely order this!), sausage, corn, cajun fries, potato and one of my personal favorites, the etouffee! The sausage comes in sliced pieces and I found it delicious to add to the etouffee which is much like a gumbo.   We came here twice. The place is constantly packed to capacity, the parking lot full and a waiting list to get a table but it's well worth the wait trust me!",

    "text": "I never thought I would say this, but I actually like Hot N' Juicy Crawfish a lot better than Boiling Crab. Don't get me wrong...I still really like Boiling Crab, but Hot N' Juicy was just excellent.   How could that possibly be you ask?   1) The equivalent to the \"Whole Sha-Bang\" was a lot less garlicky and overwhelming. I didn't leave the restaurant feeling like crap...and I wasn't still tasting the garlic the day after.   2) The food tasted a bit healthier (if that is even possible). Hot N' Juicy uses a little less butter, but it didn't seem to take away from the flavors - still leaving me craving for more.   3) The catfish was delicious. I haven't had the catfish at Boiling Crab so I can't really compare, but the catfish was perfectly juicy, crispy on the outside, and the tarter sauce was delicious.   4) There was a soup/stew-like dish (soup with Crawfish served with rice) was delicious. You can only eat so much shrimp and Crawfish, so this was a nice balance to the high-cholesterol meal.   5) The wait wasn't as bad. I came here with a friend and her family (party of 4) on a Saturday night and waited only about 20-25 minutes (the restaurant is off the strip).   6) You get a bit of a discount if you pay with cash (It's not like I can take advantage of this offer since I never have cash - but I thought I would throw that in there anyways).   Overall - great meal! I always love the ambiance!",

    "text": "LOVE. This is a regular spot for my friends and I. We went there this weekend and got the snow crab. It was awesome! A lot of our crab legs were pretty skimpy on the meat tho, but we mentioned it to our server and she gave us an extra half pound. Then because it took so long to get that half pound (they were pretty busy), she changed it to an additional pound PLUS took a pound off of our bill.  I have noticed that the service is a little inconsistent...sometimes they go above and beyond and sometimes they don't. We have had a problem with getting our drinks refilled and getting our bill split. But it really does depend on the server. Sometimes they'll say that the bill can't be split, other times it's not an issue. One thing is consistent tho - the food is always delicious!!!! I've had the crawfish, mussels, snow crab, and shrimp. Their fries are pretty delicious (I usually order a basket to dip in the sauce). Their etouffee is also fantastic. Can't go wrong here!",

The food was HOT N JUICY. for ppl who like spicy,get spicy not mild. I came home from Vegas later that night n my bf made me bathe bc I smelled like it lol. It's True it stays on you but yummy.

My preference is garlic butter with no spice.  Baby spice is still a little too spicy for me.  Have had issues with their servers not relaying no spice to the kitchen properly.  There is specific verbiage to order my preference which is \"butter & minced garlic only.\"  I couldn't remember the exact verbiage but described what I wanted and the server said she knew what i was describing.  My order came out wrong & I asked to get it corrected.  The manager on duty came to my table & proceeded to lecture me about how she told me the verbiage in the past.  First of all, the servers should be trained better so they know how to accurately write an order.  BTW - My server told me she was new and still learning.  Secondly, the manager on duty should politely tell the customer the problem will be fixed and not lecture.  Its not the customers responsibility to write an order so the kitchen knows what to make.  I would give 5 stars because i love the food here but I'm deducting 2 stars since I've had problems here.",

From seeing the reviews off yelp, we got off the plane and hailed a taxi straight to this place, which was only about 10 minutes from the airport.  The decor is low key and straight to the point...meaning they have no utensils and only a roll of paper towels on the table.  We ordered the fried catfish and chips and one pound of snowcrabs in their signature hot and juicy special.  The Fried catfish was so good!  The crust was perfect and the fish was so juicy on the inside.  The snowcrabs are to die for!  It comes in a plastic bag with the crab drenched in the sauce.  I swear for at least 5 minutes, you could not hear anyone talk because they were just eating.

    "text": "Alright sooo I have a buddy in Vegas who claimed that this place was the shit and way better than Boiling Crab and Claws out here in Orange County so I had to put it to the test. Took a trip to Vegas with a group of our friends and decided to have dinner with one of my friends friends who said we could try this place.   When we got there it looked to be pretty busy with a fifteen to twenty minute wait which wasn't to bad. The host was pretty cool and talked to us for a bit while we waited for our table. We finally got seated and ordered right away. It pretty much took them 20 minutes or more for them to come out and let us know that our food was going to be coming out a little late due to the rush they had. 10-15 minutes after that was when our food came out. The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasn't hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasn't purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit. So my friend came back to sit down with us and was irritated with the waiter for handling the situation the way he did. The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair. He joked around and said \"well thats obviously not my hair.\" and laughed because he had a buzzed head. He finally took care of the situation and took the order of shrimp off the bill for us and apologized.   Overall... place is over priced compared to what the Cali prices are. The sauce is not too bad but not what I imagined it to be after all the hype. And lastly the service sucked balls but the only thing that made up for it was the host who was nice enough to help us out. Would I go back there ever again? Absolutely not!",

    "text": "Went here right after they opened for the day on a Saturday so the place was relatively empty. We must have been there for close to an hour and a half, and by the time we left the place had filled up. The service was top notch throughout our entire meal. Multiple servers asking if we needed anything, constantly offering assistance, and refilling our drinks. Our waitress was as friendly as they come and really helped us through the ordering process.   Now the food. We ordered all our seafood with the hot n juicy seasoning: 1 lb. crawfish (medium heat), 1 lb. shrimp (medium heat) and 1 lb. snow crab legs (spicy).  I could handle the medium level fine, but the spicy level got the nose running and the pores sweating. It added to the experience.   They will demonstrate how to properly eat a crawfish, and after an attempt or two, you will have it down no problem. Make sure to suck the juice out of the head, that is where the flavor really accumulates. What is great about this meal is the seafood comes out very fast and it's nice and hot, but it will take you a while to make your way through it all with all the peeling and cracking and talking about how great everything tastes.   The snow crab legs were amazing and we immediately ordered  pound of king crab legs when we had finished those off. The shrimp was tasty.  I even decided to bite off a few heads and they were nice a crunchy.   Although the place is named after the crawfish, and those do have an unique flavor, I would almost stick exclusively to the crabs next time. So tasty. Unfortunately due to the oil spill they were only offering the snow and king crab legs. Normally whole crabs from the gulf region are available too.  It's a great dining experience. Fun and very tasty. Your knuckles will burn with spices and smell of garlic  for a few hours after, but that will serve as a reminder of money well spent in Vegas.",

    "text": "This restaurant looks like it's nothing special from the building but when you get inside it's pretty clean.  The wait wasn't too long when I went there for four people and they sat us right away.  The sauce that comes with the seafood was not too bad.  It was not as thick as the sauce from another Cajun joint in California, Boiling Crab.  It depends on how you like your sauce, I guess.  1 star for being away from all the touristy spots and near all the Asian stores! 1 star for free water 1 star just for being featured on the Food channel  -1 star for forgetting my rice -1 star for taking 20 minutes longer after I already addressed the waiter that I didn't get my rice  *tip* If you get dropped off by a cab you need to call one to get picked up because taxis do not come by this area of Vegas.",

    "text": "Man, if this place was only closer to the strip...\"Hot & Juicy Crawfish\" is a solid 4 star on the basis of it's food alone and I'd give it a half-star more if it were within walking distance.   It's a hole in the wall that makes me drool just thinking about it.  If you like crawfish and traditional New Orleans seafood delicacies kicked up a notch with some authentic and lip smacking Louisiana cajun sauce, you're in for a real treat.    So why are you gonna want to try this place?  1) SAUCE The actual reason you're going to this joint is because of the sauce.  Make no mistake - it's the sauce that makes the meal.  Yes, it's great to eat seafood, but their sauce is JUST TO DIE FOR, especially on their crawfish.   ...Now, me personally - I love the Juicy Cajun, but they also have Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Louisiana style, and a Hot & Juice Special.  And they'll spice up the sauce to your liking from Mild to Extra Spicy.  2) CRAB Do you like crab, because, oh, they've got crab.  Four kinds: - Dungeness - Louisiana Blue - Snow/Opilio - Alaskan King They also have softshell crab, shrimp, calamari, and oysters as well if you have a hankerin' for those, but the crab is very tasty and distinctly flavorful for each type.  Even with the sauces, you can very noticably tell the difference between each crab meat.  And it's all sweet and delicious... and steaming hot!  3) CRAWFISH The key is the crawfish though. They're hot and served in a plastic bag on your plastic covered table.  And this is no princess' meal here, folks.  This is down and dirty grubbin'.  Wash your hands before you eat. ...And you have to eat them CORRECTLY.  Tear off the tail, put the WHOLE head in your mouth and crunch down lightly.  This will allow you to suck out all the juice from the crawfish and with the Juicy Cajun sauce...MMMMMMMM is that good.  Then you finish off with sucking out the tail and you're on to the next one. - Live $10/lb - Frozen $6/lb  THE DOWNSIDE:  LOCATION The big problem for me is that this is a $12 cab ride there each way, so you're looking at a $24 surcharge on top of the cost of the crawfish.  It's in the middle of Chinatown in Las Vegas meaning that your first going to have to make the decision whether it's worth your while.  Personally as a foodie, it definitely was, but the cab ride tripled the price of my meal.  CONCLUSION: It's a solid 4 stars on the basis of the food alone - it's just that good.  I'd say this meal was more satisfying than a meal at many casino restaurants on the strip making it also a real value.  Keep in mind - you're not gonna go for the ambiance, the location, or the service.  You'll get served for sure, and that's about all you can ask for because you're basically doing all the work.   I'll definitely be back - especially if I go with a group because I can see how this place would be a LOT of fun in addition to being a great meal.  This was a real delight to have for lunch and I'm glad I made the trek.",

Everytime we went down to NOLA - 5 pounds. Every time the LSU alumni association would have a boil we were there. So I surprised her with a visit to HJCrawfish and it did not disappoint... Was it as good as NOLA? No f-in way. But really close and good enough.   The service IS stellar. They are all family. It's all their brother's business and they treat customers right. Right now they are getting crawfish from Texas and we think that may be why they aren't as good as they could be. Our hopes are then when they are back in season the crawfish will once again be coming in from Louisianna and they'll be even better.   Get the spicy - Good luck.",

We both ordered shrimp by the pound and even ordered seconds! The prices are reasonable! The only thing besides the slow service for her food; is the bathroom was really gross. It was dirty and both toilets were flooded. Also, the sinks were sticky to touch and the drying tissue was low quality.

    "text": "tldr:  Old rotten shrimp that belonged in the bin.  Greasy inedible fried things with a topping of of bad service.  Really? Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming ...  Overall -  Absolutely horrid is all I can say.  Food - minus one star.  Service - minus one star. Overall experience - Minus 2 stars.  Details - 8-24-2015 6:30 p.m.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp in H n' J sauce from medium to spicy.  The wait staff was indifferent except for the hostess who seemed at least partially aware that she was a paid employee.  The single male service person behind the counter was more concerned with chatting up his fellow female coworkers than taking our order, which i nearly shouted that we were ready to give (yet still ignored).  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   The order taker insisted that I give her my telephone number, which I refused to do.  She stated that it was company policy because some people leave without paying.  Wait.  This was a pre-paid to-go order how could I even do that?  I gave her a number and she took my order.  Order came out promptly.  Paid 40+ bucks for two pounds of seasoned shrimp, 8 wings and an order of Corn Fritters.  Whatever.  Not a great value but not a rip-off I suppose.  Eating It -   Got home and opened my take out order and I have to say we did not, could not finish eating what was given to us because of several things:  - Market price?  Honestly I've had fresher shrimp at the Palms Casino buffet.  Hot and Juicy adjusts the price of their offerings based on market price of goods.  An upscale restaurant can justify \"Market Price\" when they are obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  Hot and Juicy is certainly not an upscale restaurant obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  In my view, the price the customer pays should get discounted, because the seafood we got on 8-24-2015 was dicey to say the least, and likely unfit for consumption.  Really? Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   - Consistency of the shrimp in the same bag ranged from firm and fresh to powdery and obviously turned.  The majority of the shrimp we peeled were expired and belonged in the bin.  On whole I would say that the most of the batch was powdery, expired shrimp that were not kosher to serve.  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...     - They do not clean the gut-line of the shrimp!  Did you know that it may be possible to contract Hepatitis from improperly cleaned shrimp?  I understand that if they want to leave the shrimp peel and eat they can leave the shell on, but don't insult your customers by leaving the the bowels and their contents in the meal.  At least butterfly the top and remove the gut-line before boiling.  Sheesh!  Please tell me.  Would you want a beef steak with the guts hanging out on your plate when it is served?  \"Oh well this is the way it's usually done.\"  Bullshit!  How is this acceptable?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   -  The Corn Fritters, at 5.99 an order were just disgusting, greasy lumps of uncooked dough with corn pieces in them.  Disappointing and in a word, Inedible.  I don't know if they are forced to do this or what but, someone at the restaurant wrote on the the Styrofoam containers \"Corn Fritters, YUM!\"  Really?  IDK.  Have you ever felt embarassed for someone else though it has nothing to do with you?  \"Corn Fritters.  YUM?\"  No.. Just no.    Warning -  I don't know who owns this place and I have no grudge or anything like that.  It was just really, really bad.  Pictures coming up tomorrow morning when my wife decides to email me the pics.  nota bene - They have chicken nuggets on the menu for nine bucks or so that are frozen and pre-cooked.  Did not order for my son at home that does not like seafood.  I'm so tired of low quality restaurant food.  When did TGIFriday set the Gold Standard for restaurants?  I don't eat out anymore unless I can be sure that the food tastes better than what I make at home.  Hot and Juicy did not deliver value for your dollars.    {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{AVOID}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}  PEACE!  DAVE",

I should of ordered shrimp or something else. The calamari was The only thing I really enjoyed. It was ALL squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy.  The flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. The flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. The crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as I wanted.  For $90, I think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. The waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms.",

    "text": "At last count there were two Hot N Juicy Crawfish locations in Las Vegas, but I have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 Spring Mountain Road. My husband and I were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. Driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a Hot N Juicy Crawfish (in Chinatown) to get to the \"right\" Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  Located on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, Hot N Juicy Crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. Or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and I wouldn't exactly call it clean. You're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. You order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready.   Though you can get baskets of fried shrimp, crab legs, raw oysters, wings and chicken nuggets, Hot N Juicy Crawfish put their signature item right in their name. When you order the crawfish, there's a method. No \"crawfish Nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. You order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. For seasoning, you pick from Louisiana Style, Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper or a Hot N Juicy Special. Spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" That's not what they call it, that's what I called it. If you like spicy, you love this stuff.  The best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. Wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!",

This was actually my first time here , I never liked this place cause I thought it was just crawfish , and I don't like crawfish AT ALL!! Until my Best friends said \"It's not only craw fish, they have shrimp and other stuff.\" And when I heard shrimp I was like \"YUM-O.\"   So we ordered a bunch of things and of course I got a pound of shrimp in some sauce , I don't know what kind of sauce it was BUT dear lord , it was BOMB , I topped that sauce off on my rice and at it , the BEST I had so far ! Anyways , I walked in and smelled this wiff of shrimp smell , I was like oh my !! Smells so good , and made me even MORE hungry ! For a first timer , I REALLY REALLY LOOOOOVE the shrimp there .   Our service was great ! Other employees came to check on us to see if we were ok , everything was fine , our order came out good , everything was fine . The only thing I dislike is that this place is dark , im not blind lol but I don't like eating in dark , spice that light up a little , the music was on point , of course I danced , lol . I blame the shrimp! Aha .   I recommend anybody who loves shrimp to go here , because it's the best shrimp by far !   The other thing I dislike about it and it has nothing to do with the place , you actually leave with the smell as well lol and I pumped my perfume so much times that the smell of it wont go any where im like \"Omg I still can smell it.\" But then again who knows , maybe it's telling me to go back lol .   I will definitely be back for more shrimp , maybe MORE then a pound this time. Lol  Thank you Hot n' Juicy for your great hospitality! I'm very appreciated !",

Their idea of spicy is REALLY spicy, I think we had ordered mild and my friends were still dying. I was fine but there was definitely a kick to it!   I didn't take any pictures since we were pretty much just thrown into the fray of it all and it's quite messy!   I recommend the crab legs for sure, and well, the crawfish, however since it was November when we went, crawfish was not in season, so they warn you that the crawfish was previously frozen and not fresh. Thanks for the warning! We will ordered them anyway. Fries were good, softshell crab platter was good, shrimp I think was the best of them all, next to the crab legs.   A little hard getting server's attention, but other than that, it was a fun time and delicious meal.",

It's not nearly as good as the Boiling Crab, IMO. I ordered one pound of shrimp (they don't do half a pound like BC) in spicy Cajun, mild. It was the sauce that wasn't really good. Hence why I liked BC's more.   My friends all got different flavors. The Hot N Juicy special tasted like Cajun to me. I did really like the lemon pepper, though. I'll probably get that next time.   We got sweet potato and cajun fries. Sweet potato was okay, but I preferred the Cajun fries. They were yummy.   All in all, it wasn't that bad. I would come back in the future. :)",

    "text": "I first went to HNJ on a Saturday afternoon.  Although it was crowded, we got right in with no wait.  We each had a pound of crawfish with the special, which is the mix of the various flavors.  We also got it on the \"medium hot\" side.  I like stuff hot, but I have heard they can really put the heat on, so I was a little concerned about ordering it straight up hot.  We also got some fried shrimp with french fries to share.  The crawfish is delicious, but you have to WORK to get them.  They have so little meat, I would recommend shelling quite a few before eating.  In subsequent trips, my wife has had the shrimp, which are of course much larger.  They have a much better pay off, but don't have the delicious heads to suck out like the crawfish do.  I was surprised by how good the fried shrimp was.  It's probably the best I have had in the valley.  The coating was crunchy, but not overly thick or greasy.  And, they are large.  This was surprising and certainly welcome.    All in all, HNJ lives up to its considerable hype after being featured on so many TV shows.  Give it a shot.",

Ordered two pounds of crawfish, one order fried shrimp, cajun fries and fried catfish, all for four people, and it was definitely enough. I'm not sure if that's because I drank so much water that I became full. However, I love their sauce, you MUST go for their specialty! Really good asian blend of spices mixed with new orleans yummyness. I do have to admit that maybe about 10+ crawfishes in my tongue and mouth started to burn, but that wasn't going to make me stop eating!  Ok i have to admit that the crawfishes are a bit tiny, but the best part of it all is that you're suppose to suck it all. Not just eat the meat, but the brains/roes. For real! The corn was delicious after it absorbed all the flavor and it was so juicy!  Fried shrimp great, so was the catfish. I'm not sure what batter they use, but it's amazing. Nice and crusty and oh sooo full of flavor! I like how the shrimp was butterflied open, and the catfish was so juicy inside. Not overdone at all. Complaint was the cajun fries...not enough cajun seasoning.   I'm definitely having more cravings....I want some NOW! Will they deliver to CA? That would be GREAT!",

    "text": "Out of the 3 locations in Las Vegas, this is my favorite. I feel as if it is the cleanest with the friendliest staff. I also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten HnJ. The other location on Spring Mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what I had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha The bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! After eating, I always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.  For the food,  The crab is usually on point for me. It is cooked all the way through. There was ONE time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. I usually get the garlic butter flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! The hot n juicy flavor is good as well. I also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. The shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. The oysters are always yummy and I have yet to get a scrawny puny one. Their cajun fries are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. I have not eaten the crawfish, but I hear its good. I feel like its too much trouble to go through ALL THAT peeling for a tiny piece of meat.   You can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. I like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. You can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage.   All in all, I prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. I would definitely come pay this place a visit .",

Fresh crawfish flown in every day...shrimp and crab legs that are to die for, tender clams and the Hot N Juicy sauce (I prefer this sauce in hot but you get a choice of sauces & heat level) just covers everything with love!   All the seafood is served in bags so it keeps absorbing the flavor of the sauce. The crawfish comes with a potato and corn in the bag, but you can get it added to everything else. I recommend adding these as the corn gets the flavor of the sauce and the potato absorbs the sauce. I also like getting a bowl of rice as well and you can pour the sauce on it!   Yes, you are peeling and ripping your food apart with your bare hands, so ladies, if you do not want to mess up your manicure, they do provide gloves. I went brazenly bare last time though and it was a lot easier to eat and when I was done all the sauce washed off easily.  They now have 2 locations... I prefer the one that is furthest from the strip. The one closer is very, very loud because of the building. It's like being in a tin can, so take the extra 5 minutes and head a little further up Spring Mountain.  I cannot wait for my next Hot N Juicy fix!",

Maybe my experience was a fluke?  I came here around 8pm, and waited for around 40 minutes for a table. There were a few tables that cleared up quickly, but the staff didn't clean it up immediately... so the 40 minute wait could have been more of a 25-30 minute wait. They also have a strong garlicky yummy smell in the air which made the wait felt worse.  Ordered 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crawfish, 1 bag of king crab legs and some Cajun fries in their special spicy hot and juicy seasoning. I felt that their Cajun fries are over seasoned... Quite salty... Their shrimp was the best out of everything, but the shrimp was just okay. The crawfish wasn't juicy as their restaurant name would lead one to believe... Maybe it's not fresh that day??? The king crab legs felt rough and overcooked... and it was the blandest one of all...   The service here was not very good. My group had to flag waiters multiple times to get bibs, crackers, gloves, drinks, refills. I eventually gave up and just walked up to the register to ask for these items... The decor here really sucks too, very dim, simple, and at times looks quite questionable regarding sanitation... I will not be coming back. I personally love the boiling crab much more.",

    "text": "First of all I went to Vegas on a diet... (SO WHAT I CHEATED!) but it was worth the calories. And out of all the expensively ridiculously priced restaurants on The Las Vegas Strip this was the most economical (its worth a car rental/ limo drive). This place came highly recommended from Travel Channel's Man vs Food.  Ordering from menu was easy and simple. You have to definitely try my fave lemon pepper shrimp! But the crawfish, humugous king crab legs, and oysters are just as good too. It's Vegas's cheapest bag of freshest seafood and the best bang for your buck. EXTREMELY the highlight of my Las Vegas trip (off the strip)!  Employees were chill and friendly, don't be afraid to take apart anything with your hands. Great service! Too bad Hot N Juicy Crawfish isn't closer to my home town... tried a few Hot N Juicy knock-offs near home (but didn't even the close)",

    "text": "Very interesting and good New Orleans style boil restaurant.  I prefer the shrimp here (heads on) over the crawfish - add some sausage, potatos and corn to the boil and all is good.  1 lb. of shrimp is about $10, add some add-ins and it is around $13, good value, variety of 'boil' sauces are added in - I like the garlic butter mild, which is still pretty hot.  Very casual plastic tablecloth and paper towel joint on the west end of Chinatown on Spring Mountain, reasonable interpretation of a Louisiana crawfish/shrimp boil for Las Vegas - heavily frequented by Louisiana ex-pats and Chinatown regulars.  Very good option if you like this style of cuisine and don't mind making a mess when you eat.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I will be forever loyal to Cajun Corner on Brookhurst.   However, anytime I'm craving some cajun in Vegas, this would definitely be the place I would go to.    I came by with my parents when we were visiting Vegas over winter break cause my dad is a seafood fanatic and loves any form of seafood.  We started with some oysters which were shucked off the shell and came with plenty of lemon and Tabasco on the side.  We also had the hot n juicy shrimp with extra garlic which was fantastic, but not as spicy as I'm used to from Cajun Corner.    The crawfish was also well seasoned and had a bit more meat than I expected which was a big bonus.    My dad had the softshell crab which came with cajun fries although there wasn't that much cajun seasoning on them which was a bit disappointing because the seasoning was deliciously spicy and salty.  The corn was alright, only because it somehow didn't soak up the juice as it does at Cajun Corner (maybe I'm just biased)  The reason that I'm willing to give this place five stars despite a few minor preference issues is that the wait staff is great.  The waitress who took our order was fantastic, very nice and somehow managed to memorize all of the things that we ordered with modifications and had it all come out correctly.  That was impressive enough in my book considering that our ordered included different levels of spice, amounts of garlic and there was just a bunch of stuff to memorize.    I will definitely be back when the craving for cajun in Vegas strikes",

My favorite was the garlic butter crawfish I just wish I heeded the reviews and ordered the mild instead of the medium spicy.  I feel like I would've enjoyed the flavor more because it was burning my mouth.  Everything was good but because I'm from the south it doesn't quite compare.  I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars.",

Not a fan of the actual crawfish (we had 1 lb. garlic butter)...but LOVED the shrimp (we had a lb. of that as well).  We also ordered sausage/corn (all ala carte).  The starches they offer are rice bolws (1.75 a pop), and potato (boiled or french fries).  The sodas were free refills.  We actually went w/mild (which still had a bit of spiciness).  It was messy, but if you wear the bib...you are good to go!  They offer: king crab, snow, and other seafoods (menu says market price).  When we ordered, both the crawfish and shrimp were 9.99 p/lb.  For 2 people, average price is about $40 (w/drinks & tip).  Parking can be congested.  Either go early (to avoid dinner crowed) or go later (like about 8-ish).  Dining area is small...most tables only accomodates 4 ppl at the most.  I don't recommend for small children (the garlic is really strong), they don't have a children's menu.  We weren't thrilled, but we were satisfied w/our meal.  BEWARE: Garlic taste lasts a good 48 hours!!!",

Have gotten burned by not carrying my own at other places.  The staff was helpful in choosing from the menu. I ordered a pound of Crawfish - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 Lb of King Crab Legs - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 piece of corn, plus one potato, two potato, three potato more.  What gives with the only one per order on the tiny baby potato?  A girls gotta eat. Why can't they fit two or three potatoes in the bowls? The Crawfish was presented in its bag of splendor. Waiting to burst out in all sorts of flavorful excitement. One whiff and you'll see what I'm talking about. Garlic, Garlic and more Garlic, with some other spice that is captivating. By the time if figured out that all the Crawfish was gone I was already elbow deep in the succulent juices. Then I attacked the King Crab Legs. They tasted frozen, thawed and reheated in the Hot & Juicy sauce. I called the wait staff over and let her know how the crab legs tasted. She asked if I wanted something else.  I asked how often they deliver the crab and she said every day.  I would not order them again I guess that's why Crawfish is in the name.  Well, I smelled of Garlic for a few days so you can't hide where you've been after eating here.  Dress casual, tie a bib on and enjoy. They won't disappoint with the Crawfish. Oh, and ask for a second bib for your lap. Stuff can drip on you if your not careful.",

    "text": "I have to start off by saying that I may be a bit biased since I looooooooooovvvvvvveeee boiling crab.   After we landed, our first stop was to drop off our luggage at our hotel and then we jumped into a cab \"hot n' juicy please!\" This place isn't too far from the strip, a 5-10 minutes ride from where we were staying [venetian], about a $10.00 cab fare. When we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. As we were overlooking the menu I noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points!   We ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, cajun fries, and an order of rice. [FYI: you can't order half pounds here ]The food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. The skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. We were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. But their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places I've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce.   All in all, this place isn't bad; if I'm ever in Las Vegas having major shrimpas cravings I wouldn't mind coming back.",

I got buttered corn. Its fun to just get down and dirty and start peeling away and leaving your mess on the table.   Been hearing a lot about \"boiling crab\" in SF so my cousins said its just like it.   Our server was very nice. It took a little while to get your order.  Our sweet potato fries did take forever and then it was burnt so we returned them.   A great place for large parties. We did go on a sunday and we had to wait maybe 20 minutes. It was busy. Maybe this was the reason for our order taking a little while. I\"ll just have to see the 2nd time around = 0)",

    "text": "Brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. They delivered! We had 6 kiddos with us too. They placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. Its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. Eating crab in this setting was perfect!   They also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)  Food: Dungeness crab (served whole, which means legs and body) with the lemon pepper sauce. Was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. The sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) It was just spicy enough for us weaklings. Snow crab (crab legs) were sweet and large. Our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. It was delicious just like that. There are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. My mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty.  kids got chicken baskets with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. And the father in law ordered basket of fried shrimp and fried catfish. He is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! I didnt even have a chance to taste it! The only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic.   Service: Great. All the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.    Pretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? The crab is tasty and not too expensive. Its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. The only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. They only serve bottles. Give it a try. Its yummy!",

Mild my a**! I had to have a drink after every few pieces of shrimp. Eventually the garlic from the seasoning started to get too intense. Took a slight break (Oh you know, head over to Aria to grab a Four Loko and back.) before finally finishing up the bag. The fries were a tad soggy, even though they had poked holes through the container to let the steam escape. My room could have been mistaken for another Hot N Juicy location because it sure smelled like it once I was finished. I'll give myself some redemption and actually eat inside the restaurant next time.",

I sat down, looked at my foodie friend and said, \"I know I haven't eaten anything yet, but can we come back soon?\" Lol.  The smell of the garlic fills the small restaurant, and the smiles upon everyone's face makes you want to smile along with them.  I go to lunch every Saturday at 2:00 pm, and most places are dead, but this place was packed, with movement and chatter...it really has an incredible vibe!  The service was great for how busy it was and the wait staff was all friendly, our waitress explained the menu to us and also answered our questions thoroughly ( I was REALLY hoping the pictures on the walls were because of some type of eating contest, but...it was just pictures of customers..drat)  We ordered 1 lb of crawfish, Hot N Juicy Special flavor, medium.  I didn't think it was TOO spicy, but I'm not sure If I'd go up a notch on spiciness, because I'm a wuss.  We also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries.  The crawfish were AMAZING. I've never had crawfish before, so I honestly can't compare it to others, but it was down-right delish in my book.  I got a kick out of my friend squirting himself in the face with crawfish juice, and wish I went with a group of friends, as most of the people there did. I would order the crawfish again in a heart beat! But I would get 1 lb to myself instead of sharing, because it was sooo nummy! Next time I'm probably going to try the King Crab legs, oooh yess.  The Calamari seemed really good at first, but the more I ate it the more salty it seemed to be...I probably wouldn't order them again because there are so many more appetizers to try! Next time I will probably try the fried catfish!  The cajun fries weren't my cup of tea, a little too spicy for poor little me.  My dear friend grubbed on them though, said he really liked em.  It was a lot of fun getting down and dirtay, and working for my food. And honestly, I would TOTALLY recommend eating here as a first date, whats a better way to get to know someone then being knee deep in delicious crawfish?",

And, once she delivered our food, she disappeared. So when we wanted to order more food and get our drinks refilled, no one came over to help us. We were disappointed.

This trip I made it a priority and was the first restaurant to hit on my Vegas weekend and I will definitely come back regardless of reeking of garlic after walking out of the place. Even the next day i could still smell the garlic on the clothes that I wore to the restaurant.  Everything we ate was delicious!! My bf and I ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of the crawfish both in the medium hot n juicy special sauce. And let me tell you, the medium was still very spicy. I'm glad I didn't get the hot. My lips were tingling with the medium and I love spicy food. We also got and order of the cajun fries and a side of rice. I put some of the sauce on the rice and that was super delicious!!   Other reviews say how packed this place gets. Not the case on a thursday night. We were seated immediately, however there was a good sized line when we left. Service was great and the food was wonderful. Our next trip out we will definitely be stopping for a bite again.",

Otherwise, the shirmps were jumbo and sweet.  The service was spot on.  Our server Javier was very attentive given a busy Friday night.   Gloves were given to each table in case you didn't want to get your hands covered in sauce.  Crab crackers were also given at every table who ordered crab.  Free soda refills table side was given at the drop of the hat.",

    "text": "So I was at my GF's hotel room at TI, and we were laying down there watching TV relaxing and digesting all the junk and drinks we had the night before and during the day at the pool. We both took a nap and I turned on the TV. Then all sudden we realized MAN VS FOOD was being televised in Las Vegas. So it caught our attention. So being from Texas and having access to good NOLA type of food an cajun food. I was intrigued that this guy was at a local joint here off Spring Mountain Road ((KNOWN FOR ASIAN FOOD)) and thought to myself.. I gotta try that place out. So needless to say, we jumped in a taxi and headed over there. The minute you get there, your eyes start to water and you can smell the spice from 20 yard OUT from the front door. I knew at this point I was in love. Sorry sweetie, but there is room for more than one love in my life.. Its called food :) Though, we placed our name on the list and it took a while to sit us down. That was ok, I knew it would be a wait. Though, once we sat down and we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and an order of king crab! We were in love! Some of the best food! I cant say it was the best Ive ever had, but might tasty and I filled my stomach up with anything I saw on the table. Its completely messy though. So expect to leave with the smell of spice and seafood on your body for the next couple of days. Also expect to be drenched in a goooy saucey spice sauce all over your fingers! The food was served in huge bags with the food in them. You rip them apart and lay it all out on the trash bag covered table. It was a bliss for me. Everyone was really friendly and I really really enjoyed the food adn my experience. It was very affordable and I would come back for sure! Not to mention the blonde new jersey girl told us a story that the guy from MAN VS FOOD, got drunk and passed out in the back of her car. Wonder what else happened :) hehe jk.. regardless, if you are in the Las Vegas area, and you want to get something away from the strip and enjoy a good meal. make your self available to this awesome lil hole in the wall. You will not be let down!",

They actually ate @ hot n juicy the day before and it was sooo good that they wanted to take us and eat there again. They kept raving about how great it was and boy were they rite. We went during the day for lunch so there wasn't really anyone there which was good bc the place gets packed for dinner. I'm from the bay so I'm not new to the crawfish scene. I've tried several crawfish places in the past but hot n juicy is by far the best. If you've ever been to a crawfish restaurant then you know it's all about the sauce they cook it in. The hot n juicy special is the bomb diggity. The perfect combo of herbs and spices. You also get to pick the level of spicyness that you want. I personally prefer the shrimp over the crawfish but thats just me. Peeling shrimp is less work and more meat so you do the math. I wish there was a hot n juicy in the bay. Maybe they will think about expanding soon. lol Be prepared to get your hands dirty but it is super worth it. You will not be disappointed! There was also an episode of man vs. Food about hot n juicy too so you know it must be good.",

    "text": "I've been craving a good crawfish place in Vegas for years!  My husband and I wanted to check this place out because we saw it on \"Man v Food.\"  Don't let the location fool you.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, though the place was obviously really busy.  For five of us we ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of king crab legs.  Looking back, we should have ordered more pounds of crab because 4 pounds of crawfish is an insane amount.  Both the crab and crawfish were so fresh and perfectly cooked.  They were brought out in plastic bags soaking in sauce, which I understood was to help the food really absorb the flavor.  We ordered it all with garlic butter flavor at the \"spicy\" level.  When they say spicy, they mean spicy.  We all have a high tolerance for spicy foods, and the restaurant's level of spicy maxed out our taste buds.  I recommend ordering rice or rolls to help tone down the spicy.  On a sidenote, don't wear anything that you'd mind getting dirty.  It is highly likely that you'll get crawfish juice on yourself or someone will get you from across the table.  Also, come mentally prepared to eat with your hands & no plates--it's part of the fun!  We also tried the seasoned fries, which were wonderfully prepared: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, perfect hot seasoning.  Halfway through our meal, the co-owner/wife of the chef came by our table to check on how we were doing.  She's kind and genuine--really wanting to know how our experience was so far.  Our waitress, Binh, was one of the most attentive servers I've ever met.  I cannot wait to go back!",

It's a small little restaurant but the atmosphere inside is lively and inviting. the staff is not the best, the waitress never came back to fill my water or ask me if everything is alright even when I told her this was my first visit. I also mentioned I heard about the restaurant from Man Vs. food to her and she wasn't impressed or cared at all. Even though they had people waiting outside, doesn't mean she should not give me great service. It wasn't just me, the tables around me did not get any attention either. I will go back to this place because of their Awesome Crawfish and Sauce! Wish we had one here in Minnesota!",

I actually told everyone at work about this \"hole in the wall\" and let me tell you - I am a very hard to please person so when I say something is good - I do mean it!  The only down side to this i guess is the wait time... got there 830PM was told that the wait time is 45 minutes but ended up waiting an hour or so.  My husband and I walked to the gas station to get a beer - placed it in a styro and drank it outside while waiting to enjoy our wait time ... I am sure if you are planning on going with friends you like - as long as you keep each other company, the wait time will not really matter (just make sure you are not SUPER hungry though).  After we ordered our food, it came quickly and we were ready to eat - be ready to eat barbaric style - we used our hands to eat here and it was so much fun!  what can I say - I am a cheap date and I hate formal dining anyway so this worked for me! Will kids love it? Well, if you are ready to peel the shells off the shrimps for them I'm sure they will eat a lot! Spicy is spicy - hubby got the hot n juicy spicy shrimp and he was sweating all right.... a pound of that for him n 2 bowls of rice, a pound of garlic n butter for me no spice and a rice n we were so full!  Try it - I am sure you will love it!",

    "text": "Well I had high expectations being that I'd heard about this place on Man vs. Food and was already a big fan of The Boiling Crab.  The biggest disappointment about my visit to Hot N Juicy was the service.  There were plenty of empty tables around 1pm but we stood at the door for quite a while before we were seated. Then after we were seated, we waited quite a bit longer before we placed our order.  The food came out slowly and so did the check.  In addition, the food was OK but I definitely prefer Boiling Crab and I'm glad that's the one near me!  I gotta say I was let down a bit by this place. The crawfish didn't have that sweet taste that I'm used to at BC and the rice was crispy and undercooked. Maybe it was an off day but I think I'll try some other places next time I've in Sin City.",

I havent had good quality yet so i tend to stay away from that.   also order their fries and wings! super crispy and they stay that way throughout the meal.   nom nom nom! i am glad theres one in vegas so i dont have to go to california to get a boiling crab fix.",

I think we only paid 11.99 / pound. Be careful of the sauce..the garlic can be very strong if you aren't used to it and the sauce can be super spicy...I case you're not a spicy loving eater.  The service is always great and the white rice on the side is a must!! Just and fyi, they refused to call us a cab back to the strip because they said that too many people call a cab and ditch the cab. As a result the cab companies have blocked out there business. You have to use your own phone which isn't that great because it was long distance for me. We waited about ten minutes instead and eventually we took a cab back to the strip that had just dropped off some diners at the restaurant. Good thing we were lucky because it's too far to walk back to the strip!",

We ordered 2 lbs of the shrimp with corn, mild spices (I'm a big pansy when it comes to spicy foods) with the garlic butter seasoning and it was DELICIOUS. 2 lbs between three was just the right amount and the mild was the right amount of spice for me. Maybe next time, I'll be more ballsy and try the medium. Thankfully, we got there relatively early, around 5 pm, so we only had to wait a few minutes. It was a great experience and it definitely does not hurt that the beer was cheap too!",

The food was definitely messy, but that's part of the whole experience of coming here. It's definitely something fun and different. My only gripe is that the butter and garlic sauce on the seafood gets all over your hands and the smell of it is IMPOSSIBLE to get off! It took almost a day for the smell to disappear!",

    "text": "First I would like to start off by saying the other location is not the same.  We come here every time we visit HNJ and I tried giving the 2nd location in chinatown a 2nd chance the flavors to me taste different and I believe service is better at the original location.. But then again I was wrong.  We were told there was no wait to go to the other location and it's exactly the same I said no because I like this original place better.  To me the flavors are different.   I hyped about HNJ to all my girls for months before our bachelorette party weekend and when we got there the girls were impressed and loved the HNJ sauce!  But our complaint is our server.  She said she could split our tab 3 ways so we grouped into 3 groups.  We had 10 girls. When we got our tab all our bills were wrong some orders were scattered in different groups which isn't a big deal because that can always be fixed.. Then we found out one of the girls had ordered 2lbs of mild HNJ crawfish but only received 1lb she just said forget it. There was a moment where a different server tried to drop off a 1lb of HNJ medium and no one knew who it belonged too we sent it back because no one ordered it well our server told us she brought it back and gave it to is anyways and someone ate it. We told her no one ate it and we would have noticed a extra bag of crawfish sitting around the table!  She couldnt even tell us who she gave it to.  The girls could barely manage what they ordered and I was the only person that ordered a extra lb after my order! The server Helaine said there is a extra order I brought it back out and put it on the table someone ate it and I didn't eat it so I'm not paying for it since I didn't eat it because this is coming out of my pocket! We told her no one got it we returned it and she insisted that she sent it back out! I said u should check ur cameras and roll the tape and see where that extra bag went!  She already got her 18% automatic gratuity from our large group of 10 and she was complaining about $9.99 coming out of her pocket that was our automatic tip that went to her poor rude service!  HNJ should re-evaluate there servers!  We didn't want to cause a scene since there was so many of us.  We figured if she really wanted that $9.99 she can have it!  We definitely did not return!  I been coming here for years and always rave about this place to my friends everywhere but beware the service is a hit or miss!  I admit the seafood is great but service is down right awful!  This happened memorial day weekend",

We got the oysters (huge in size) about $17 for a dzn, very reasonably priced and it was delicious.  How it works:   They sell their crawfish,shrimp,crab,etc. by the lbs.  You get to pick the level of spiciness, and a type of sauce you want to accompany the seafood of your choice.  We chose 1 lbs of shrimp (about$11/lbs) level 3 spiciness in the hot and juicy sauce.  It was amazing, but sauce is heavy with garlic, but I love garlic.  The shrimp was seved head on, served in a plastic bag soaked in in the hot and juicy sauce.  Very flavorful   I recommend getting a side of Sweet potato fries or the an order of the fried soft shell crab (which comes with basket of Cajun fries.)",

You never have to give me any excuses to eat with your hands, I will always be there for that party.    This being said, I was not extremely impressed with the food at Hot n Juicy Crawfish.  The crawfish were frozen the nights I've been here, but they always say they usually get in fresh when they can.  The flavors were all pretty good, although I preferred the Hot-n-Juicy flavor and the cajun one was also very good.  The food came by the pound, and when we asked how much to order she told us about a pound per person.  This was way too much!  But I can never be mad at someone for suggesting a lot of food, it will all get eaten at some point, right?    The food was relatively cheap, at around $10 per pound of each type of seafood.  We got the shrimp and the crawfish, and wish I would have tried the Dungeness crab, it sounded really good.    If you're looking for a fun meal to grab with friends, definitely try out Hot n Juicy Crawfish.  But since the place was on Man v. Food, it may take you a little while to wait for your reservation, so maybe try to go during off hours.",

However our server Miss lemonade asked if we were ready to order but we were still deciding so we politely said we aren't ready yet. She left giving us an impatient attitude.   Since we both weren't that hungry we decided on 1lb of pound of shrimp ( Hot N Juicy flavor with mild spice) and sweet potato fries to share.  Our food arrived really fast, but boy was it good. I was slightly disappointed with the fries since it was super bland. I prefer Boiling Crab's fries. However I must say I do like their shrimp better.   As we were still eating the server asked if we wanted more and we said no. Then 10 minutes later she asked again and politely we said no again and stormed off with an attitude again to get our check.

    "text": "4.5 star realistically.  This is truly one of the must have spots when you visit Vegas!  The first thing you notice in the overwhelming smell of fresh crustaceans!  The reason I marked them down a little is because our server was average and even had a small attitude or annoyance in her tone.  We are new and wanted some help in explaining how the experience and ordering process worked.   I went for the 1 lb of crawfish and added 2 half ears of corn and two red potatoes to the bag.  I chose the Hot N Juicy seasoning with a medium spice level.  The medium spice level had my nose dripping a little and I like spice.  They told us the crawfish were a little smaller this time of year, and 1 lb consisted of 16, which was still a good amount. The seasoning was excellent! Never really tasted anything quite like it, had a unique flavor.. a mix of Asian and Cajun.   I finished with the only dessert option on the menu, the fried brownie bites.  Again, better than expected.  Crispy on the outside gooey, hot and rich on the inside.  Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to make time for dinner here again.",

I usually get shrimp and snow crab with a piece of corn on the cob and a potato in the bag.  Obviously they have crawfish too and king crab and blue crab.  They also have chicken strips and fries for the kiddos. Plus a few other fried options.  They are always busy but still have good service for the most part.   They all work together and help each other  out.  If I could change one thing it would be to put lids on the drink cups because outr hands get slippery with all that sauce and having the lid will help prevent a big mess.  Although we  didn't spill I was worried the whole time my 5 year old was going to spill his drink all over himself and me.  But the food is so good and in my opinion worth the $100+ we spend every time we go we eat there.",

    "text": "If y'all know me I am a huge seafood lover, and this is a long, over due review lol.   FOOD: On point every time. First, I cannot stress enough on how fresh their crawfish is and how consistently tender the meat is. I've also had their mussels, clams, crab legs, and shrimp and they were all consistently juicy, tender, and delicious. I never have to worry about whether the seafood item I want is in season or not because I trust that they serve the freshest ingredients every time. Next, the sauce and spice level! For seasoning, you can choose from: Louisiana, juicy cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy; for spice level, you can choose from: baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, and extra spicy. I recommend ordering the crawfish, shrimp, and mussels by the pound with either the hot n juicy or garlic butter sauce at mild level, white rice, and sweet potato or cajun fries.   SERVICE: I prefer this Hot n' Juicy location over the others because it's the cleanest and conveniently located next to Bambu. All the servers are usually friendly, but I have to give a shout out to Max K. He is always attentive, friendly, and personable. I generally know what I want to order, but he makes the extra effort to suggest other items without pressuring me; tip: the oysters are large and juicy, so I highly recommend that if you're into raw oysters. If you're a new customer or returning customer, and got Max as your server, just know that you're in good hands and will receive a fantastic dining experience!  OVERALL: I highly recommend this place if you're down for a messy and juicy experience. Buying seafood buy the pound, getting your fingers dirty, wearing a bib, and drinking an ice cold beer is the best way to enjoy a family style meal if you ask me.",

    "text": "I didn't eat seafood at all until I moved to Vegas and met Hot N Juicy. Now, shellfish is my favorite food! We have been here at least 10 times, but this review will focus on our Valentine's Day experience.   There are three locations now in Vegas, and this is apparently the original one in the city. It is in an old beat up strip mall of sorts, and this is definitely not a fancy type establishment. But the restaurant is clean and there are no complaints in that regard, it is just on the \"bare bones\" side of things.   Service: we went early on V-Day because we knew it'd be busy. We were quoted 20 minutes and were seated in 5. Our server was polite, attentive, and helpful with our beverage questions. Food was delivered quickly and multiple people checked in with us and offered refills and extra gloves.   Food: I do agree that most of the sauces taste very similarly, but if you're coming here to eat sauce, you kind of lost the point...At least three taste the exact same to me. If you want contrast, lemon pepper doesn't taste anything like the Hot n Juicy flavor in my opinion. The shellfish is incredibly fresh and well cooked (you can tell by how it comes out of the shells), and the variety of multiple types of muscles and multiple times of crab is nice.   My only real complaint (not enough to lose a star over), is that I wish there were more vegetable options. I like having more than a small ear of corn with my meals...  I strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys shellfish.",

We had mussels, oysters, king crab legs, snow crab legs, lobster, and of course crawfish. Mouth is watering just thinking bout it. We got both the Cajun seasoning and hot n juicy seasoning in various different heat levels. For me the medium was perfect. My boyfriend got extra spicy but he said it really wasn't all that hot. Then again he eats spice like it's nothing. Overall the meal and the service was awesome. We only waited bout 20min till we were sat and we had a relatively large party(7people).

The food was great (4 stars) but the service earned that extra fifth! If you do one food adventure in Vegas this is it!  I went at about 7 on a Saturday, and let me say the place was packed, I would definitely be more strategic next time!  But despite being run ragged, their whole staff were friendly, helpful, and attentive! They told me it would be about 20 minutes for a table, so when I got one in 15 I was quite happy!  Timothy, our server, was amazing.  Despite obviously having a lot on his plate he took the time to really go in depth with me about all of my questions when he found out it was my first time. He even put on a pair of gloves when we got our food and gave us a step by step on how to demolish our respective crustaceans!   Checked on us many times, made sure glasses were full, and gave us quite a few valuable honest opinions.   I wish I could have Timothy at every resturaunt!  The food!  DELICIOUS.  At Timothy's suggestion we had hot n juicy sauce on our crawfish and lemon pepper on our king crab and shrimp. Definitely the right choices!  I had the crawfish and crab mild level spicy, and I like spice!  It was definitely the right heat.  My partner had hers \"less than mild\", which is their secret lowest spice level, and for her sensitive palate it was perfect!    Order a variety, the crawfish is fun but not filling.   The king crab was great, but pricey, next time I'll stick to regular crab.    If you don't have them throw a corn on the cob in each bag you are cheating yourself, some of the best corn I've ever had.  The sauces are amazing, I definitely recommend asking your server what pairs best with each seafood.   The hot n juicy is awesome, but definitely spicier even t the same heat level.  If they open a HnJ in northern Cali, I hope the staff here considers moving out here! XD it'd be a privilege to eat with them again!",

    "text": "We've been coming here ever since they opened, you know, before they were uber popular because of Man vs. Food, before there was an hour wait to get seated,... We'd be the only ones in the restaurant and those days are long gone.    Plain and simple, the food is good. We had Crawfish and shrimp with garlic butter- less than mild, 2 sides of rice... OK, I love garlic but there's an abundance of it in the food. If you're not a fan of garlic, you are NOT going to like this  particular sauce.   The taste and smell of the food is pretty strong, thanks to the massive amounts of garlic, you can smell like seafood and garlic for a couple days after you eat here... No matter how many times you shower, no matter how many times I tried to get rid of the smell, it just would not go away. So if you've got some where to be and the smell of garlic and seafood will not be so appealing to the people around you, I suggest to come back another day because, it's no joke, the smell STICKS for days :)   (I'm doing laundry today, 2 days later and my purse and clothes still smell like garlic)",

During the summer its recommended to call ahead for seating or just expect a wait. Our waitress told us this place is usually PACKED.   We will continue to come here when we visit Vegas..

I compared \"Hot N Juicy\" with \"Boiling Crab\"  #1 the waitresses in boiling crab is hands down way cuter and friendlier. there was a server that we asked \"how long is the wait, we have been waiting 15min already\", he replied \"well good for you\" then left. I was ready to punch that idiot there and then....  i calmed down and we were seated in a booth  #2 the booth made my back hurt. It was sinking too much in the butt area and was not giving way in the legs area. if you were there to lounge and have some drinks, this would have been nice but you need to eat on the table and it was a task to lean forward for us to eat.  we ordered 2 lbs. of crawfish with the special sauce in mild level(mild level was for my  Girlfriend)....  #3 their mild level sauce is like a hot level sauce. I am not a big fan of spicy hot stuff but i could take some heat. I like wasabe, kimchi, the rooster sauce, tabasco i even eat a pickled jalopeno on its own with out trouble. but the mild sauce that this place offers made the surrounding of our lips look like it had wind burn. either the waitress or food server made a mistake or their mild level is way too hot to be mild.  so bottom line: WILL I GO BACK.....NO!, \"Boiling Crab\" is just a few minutes away",

Most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different.  What sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness.  As far as the items to order Ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.  King Crab Legs  - Hands down the item to get.  Huge chunks of crab with little effort.  You just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  Use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  Ask your server if you need help.  Don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.    Shrimp - If your not going big with the crab legs then these are the best bang for your buck.  Best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.  Corn - Soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  Make room in your gut for this.  Don't Sleep!   Fries - Regular or Sweet Potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.  Sauce - I prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  I also prefer extra spicy which I wouldn't suggest for most people.  Even spicy has a kick to it.  They can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full.",

    "text": "If I were to rate this place based on the food alone, I would give it a 4.5.. The shrimp was really good with the signature hot and juicy sauce, even better than what I've had at boiling crab *gasp!! My friends and I shared deep fried soft shell crab, catfish, and fries, which were all really yummy.  What brought it waaaay down for me was the HORRIBLE service! We went to eat there on a Saturday evening, so we were expecting it to be really busy, but it wasn't. Thought that would be a good thing because our server would probably have more time to be attentive, but NO! My friend's mouth was on fire from the spicy sauce and had to ask for a coke refill 4 times before a different server finally came and refilled her cup, I had to ask for water 3 times, my other friend's plastic bib broke and she had to repeatedly ask for another before someone finally brought her a new one.  When I received my bag of shrimp, there was a hole in it and juices were leaking everywhere. I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, \"Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?\" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say \"Fine,\" in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table. Um, excuse me?? First of all, I wanted to save my delicious sauce for my rice, not for licking off the f*cking table, DICK. I wish I ordered crab instead of shrimp so I could use the claws to attack him.  Overheard the tables next to ours complaining about the bad service and the unnecessary attitudes as well. I hope the management at this establishment figures out a way to properly train their employees to be helpful, attentive, and polite. Until that happens, I won't be returning to Hot and Juicy.",

Avoid the peak hours or make friends with the people who live down the street (or at the Asian massage parlor next door - score!)  The shrimp was great (lemon butter sauce!). I also really enjoyed the Catfish. The crawfish in the namesake however was way too much work for way too little meat. Also, their 'mild' is my 'spicy' though I still enjoyed tearing those bodies apart like some hungry, homicidal Cloverfield.  The old man footed the bill during a visit to his favorite son and daughter in-law on the 9th island. I would definitely come back on my own though, for that awesome catfish and shrimp.

It's sits right next to Nora's and Fierfly in my book for something, different, excting, deliciuous, fun, and affordable. It is always packed! We went Monday night at 8:30 and still had to park across the street and wait 30 minutes to be seated.  But, it's worth it.    The funny thing is, I don't even eat the crawfish. I go for the crab! The shrimp and clams are also very good.  This place is really great because you can personalize your selction.  Pick your seafood, pick your sauce, pick your level of spice.  NOTE: They are not kidding around here - SPICY MEANS SPICY.  They put all your grub in a plastic bag and serve it to you tied in a knot.  You can have them add corn, or potatoes insode as well.  I stick to 1 lb. of crab hot n juicy special medium.  I like to get corn on the cob thrown in there, plus order some sausage on the side. Rolls are a must to soak up the rest of that garlic butter infused seafood juice.  The service isn't that great but isn't that always the case for the best grub.    Strap on your bib, and get ready for your lips to burn, your nose to run, and your beer to slip out of your galicky hands.",

I've come to the realization that the effort required to enjoy these puppies is not worth it for me. :|   The seasoning of the crawfish was nice (hot 'n juicy), although I enjoyed eating the shrimp more... maybe because there's more meat in the shrimp!?   The restaurant got pretty busy, and I can easily see a wait being possible. If you head in around 6 or so, you shouldn't have a problem getting a table.",

It seriously makes me salivate every time I think about the delicious sauce that my shrimp and crab was saturated in.   I went with a fairly large group and we had a total of 12 lbs crawfish/shrimp/crabs. And it was completely devoured in 30-45 minutes. We had a mix of mild + medium spices and all of the food was soaking in the Hot n Juicy sauce.   MMMMMMM. I want to make another trip out here soon just for this place!",

I have to pay it a visit.  This place is worthy of All-Madden status.  Crab Legs with a delicious blend of Cajun and Creole spices in a bag.  It does not get much better than this.  The crawfish etoufee appetizer is wonderful--more like a soup than the traditional etoufee I am used to.  I had the stone crab legs which were wonderful, but I think the King Crab legs are the best.  This is not a place you would see Rachel Ray at, but I love it!  Thanks to the Las Vegas Hoyas!  We are Georgetown!",

The crawfish was well seasoned and their spicy, hot n juicy special wasn't very spicy but it's fine, it was actually my preferred level of hotness.  Their cajun fries were good \"enough\", just some cajun spices sprinkled on regular french fries.  Their oysters were a good start also, but their chicken nuggets (we had a child with us) sucked.

We had the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning with medium spice level. The medium was a little mild for me and would recommend going for spicy if you want more kick. The crawfish was super fresh while shrimp wasn't as fresh but still tasted good. Compared to Boiling Crab, the seasoning had less garlic which is good or bad depending on what you like. The service was good, wait was not as long as BC, and they even give you the choice to use gloves in case you don't want your hands to stink for a week.",

I love hot food, but the mild was too hot for me, I was sweating and nose dripping from the heat. I would suggest moving 1 hot level down to be safe. Be prepared to use your hands or plastic gloves over you hands to eat. There are no plates or silverware. Most of the food comes in plastic bags and you eat out of it on top of a clean plastic covered table. At $28 per pound of king crab legs and $184 for 3 people to eat, kind of cavemanish! But if your into the food and don't care how it's served or how to eat it then definitely try this place. King crab & soft shell crabs were excellent, shrimp & sausage was great, etouffee & crawfish was OK.  The food must be good because there is always a line to get in, but not sure if it was because their other restaurant down the street was closed due to some remodeling going on. The only cons for this place is I got mostly the top or body parts of the crab instead of the legs. Everyone else got legs. I mentioned this to the waiter and he didn't give a crap. Went there June 23, 2016.",

My wife, family, friends, and anyone who comes to Vegas for a visit, we always take them here.  Everyone has had great things to say and recently I have noticed some new employees.  The service has been some what better but still has room to improve.  Either I have adjusted to their spice levels or they have reduced them, I don't think it is as spicy as it used to be.

The shrimp was slightly overcooked which made them hard to peel, but the flavor of the sauce was excellent!  I'm from Cali and I am a big fan of The Boiling Crab so the sauce is up there with Boiling Crab's whole shabang. My one complaint about the sauce would be that it was too watery/thin and it didn't stick to the shrimp very well.  I also had the cajun fries and it wasn't my favorite as I've had better elsewhere.  I hear they are opening a Boiling Crab out here in Vegas but until then, I'll probably be back if I ever have a craving.",

The cab driver told us that there is always a wait but totally worth it. We waited for at least one hour in the hot Vegas heat and it WAS worth it. They felt bad for us waiting and sat us at the counter.   Everything is plastic because this place gets messy! We ordered the crawdaddies and they were served in a plastic bag. When we finished, we ordered another order!   After spending what seemed like hours in the place, we ended up getting the same cab driver back and he rolled down the windows. He wasn't surprised when we told him that he was right.   **this place is off the beaten path but totally worth it**",

Don't take me wrong I like Hot N' juicy Crawfish.However,if compare it with The Boiling Crab I prefer the boiling crab to the hot n' juicy crawfish.Why? It is because the boiling crab sauce is a bit more delicious and suit my taste better than the hot n' juicy crawfish.A bowl of rice here served in a small bowl so if you are a big eater it won't be enough. The hot n' juicy and the boiling crab has a similar menu except the boiling crab have gumbo and the hot n' juicy doesn't.   However,if you are an alcohol drinker Hot N' Juicy Crawfish has an alcohol license while The Boiling Crab doesn't serve alcohol.   I would give this restaurant 3 or 3 1/2 stars.",

As many of stated, you will be expected to get your hands dirty at this place, however they do offer bibs and gloves if needed. And if seeing shrimp with their heads on scares you, then this is not the place for you.  I'm not a big crawfish fan, I just stick to my regular choice when I come here, Hot & Juicy style, Mild, 1 lb of shrimp with corn & sausage with a bowl of rice on the side. It comes to less than$15 total before tax & tips. It is cheap considering it's fresh and well-seasoned seafood!  The only down side I would say is the parking as many have mentioned here. I was lucky couple times and found a spot in their little strip mall parking lot. But other times I had to park in Church's Chicken lot because all the side streets were taken. And throughout dinner I was nervous that my car would get towed, but luckily it didn't. So my suggestion is carpool, go early if you can! Otherwise if you have a big party and go later, be expected to wait at least 30~45 min at least.",

The only reason it took a bit longer was because we had a huge party... and that's understandable.   My order: 1lb of shrimp (hot/juicy special, mild), calamari, and sweet potato fries. The shrimp was extraordinary, while the calamari and sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary. I love the yummy  butter garlicky lemon buttery spicy sauce that they boil those bad boys in. A tip: after taking off the shell, pinch the shrimp meat so that it flattens out a bit and then take it on a dunk in the sauce. Believe me, it helps to sop up that sauce!   The fries needed a bit more salt but it was good and crunchy! The calamari was great. Needed a bit more uniqueness to it but all in all, it was tasty.  Would I go here again? Hell yesssss!!!

Definitely not a place to wear nice or light colored clothing to. I ended up getting Medium for heat because that's what the waitress had suggested. However, the only thing that seemed some what spicy was the corn at the bottom of the bag. The overall taste of their signature Hot & Juicy seasoning was perfect!

CONS: the cajun fries, just fries with seasoning? it have nothing on the bc fries.  dont get it, its just regular fries! the charge extra for more seasoning on top of the seasoning thats already on there, (which is not enoughhh by farr)  their price is bout the same as bc, maybe a dollar more, but hey! ur in vegas, this place is definitely a stop to make!",

I was definitely salivating waiting for the food to come out...which actually didn't take very long! Everything was SOOOOOO good! Next time though I think I will stick with the mild hotness level. My mouth was on fire by the time I was through...the cajun fries were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but I guess that's why they call it HOT and juicy. Everything that we ordered totaled up to about 45 bucks plus sodas....not a bad deal. BTW....the rice with some sauce is oh so delicious! I will definitely be back for more garlic dousing!",

    "text": "If you told me about a Chinatown in Vegas, I would assume there is another theme casino going up where landing 3 fake Prada bags in a slot machine is a jackpot.  Apparently, it's an actual part of Vegas. Well slap me silly, get me an asian massage and love me long time!  Somehow there is also a Cajun style crawfish restaurant in the smack dab middle of it.  One of my favorite things right of the bat is the eat-in style - roll of paper towels, plastic single-use table covers, and bibs. They know yo' ass is gonna make a mess. And because their food is fresh, this is not a pun!  The shrimp and crawfish are a nice hefty size. Not the itty bitty crap you would get at Sizzler. However, if you cone hungry and have your eyes set on crawfish, you have to realize that there is a small ratio of edible meat per square inch. It's only the tail. Shrimp is a better option in this respect.    If you are really hungry, which is completely possible if there is a wait and you stand outside, watching people eat through the window, they have a great fried food menu, including chicken, crab, catfish, shrimp, and fries.  The shrimp, crawfish, and other fish is available in several flavors, ranging from mild to cajun to hot-n-juicy.  It comes out in a nice plastic bag with the sauce.  All get nicely fumed with flavor after they are boiled.  Pair that with a nice cold brew and you will understand the draw of this place.    I hope this wasn't a mirage in the middle of the desert and this place really does exist.",

    "text": "I wanted to avoid the overpriced Vegas strip restaurants during this most recent visit so I decided to check out some eateries off the beaten path.  I love crawfish and I'm a huge Boiling Crab and was very excited to check this place out, especially after all the positive reviews.  The ambiance was cool and laid back, and the staff was actually very helpful and accommodating.  The better half and I decided to each do 2 lbs of crawfish, both in the hot n juicy flavor but mine in medium spice and hers in spicy.  We also split a side of fried calamari.  The amount of food we ordered was actually dead on and the calamari added a nice contrast to the crawfish.  The crawfish, however, was just okay.  Perhaps my expectations were too high but as other reviewers have mentioned, there's something off about the flavor.  It was a bit bland, even though I could see tons of garlic on every single crawfish.  Dipping it in the lime w/salt, pepper and chili powder helped a little but the flavoring was still a bit lacking.  All in all, it was an okay meal.  Would I come back?  Probably not but it was a nice alternative to food on the strip.",

Seriously though, this place is the place to go for your crawfish fix in LV outside of Louisiana. I eat a ton of crawfish (okay, maybe half a ton) so believe me when I said I didn't think there would be a place outside of the Bayou that does crawfish this good. The wait staff were fast and tentative and will leave you in peace if they see you are happily making a mess of yourself in enjoying your food. The only thing I would have to say is negative is not to get the sausage as it's not as good as the other items on their menu. Definitely give this place a try if you slither out of the Bayou like I do once in a while.",

I went to this location on April 21st to order take-out.....and when I say take-out, I mean driving an hour back home!  I ordered 7lbs of the live crawfish, garlic butter baby spice, with the sauce on the side.  Since have to drive back home I always try to bring ice with me to quickly cool down the crawfish so it won't keep cooking in transit, then I reheat ut when I get home; but, that day my stop at H n J was on a whim (hey when you have a craving you must obey!).  The manager (I'm so sorry I forgot your name ) was kind enough to bag up some ice for me to put on top of the crawfish bags!!!  To top it off, she packed the order in a box, put the ice in, the picked up the box told me to open the door and she took the box out to the car for me!  You can't ask for better customer care than that!!!!!  Thank to the wonderful servers and manager at Hot n Juicy!  This is my new favorite location.  Oh and the food was amazing...trust me it reheat really well.",

I went with a group of five last time and we started with a pound per person and added on as needed - it comes out fairly quickly so you're not left waiting too long. ALSO - we had a variety of \"spice tolerance\" at our table ranging from \"I think ketchup is spicy\" to \"bring the heat, baby!\" and everyone ended up happy sharing EVERYTHING. Our waitress was really helpful - and they always are - to make sure everyone got what they wanted (secret - if you want it spicier, get extra sauce on the side!)  Being a desert dweller, seafood is kind of foreign... I always expect it to be super expensive and not be satisfied with the portions. That's not the case here. For what you get, the prices are VERY reasonable and I always have to roll myself on out of there after I've finished gorging.",

    "text": "One of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas!  I'm a Southern girl and grew up eating mudbugs (crawfish) piled high on backyard picnic tables.  It's next to impossible to find really good Cajun crawdaddies outside of the deep south so I usually avoid trying because I'm almost always disappointed.  I have found the mudbug holy trail though!!  My guy is a Yankee and my mom and I are on a mission to southernize him as best we can hehe.  So one night crawdaddies were brought up and I realized I had a major hankering for the little red guys I had heard good things about this place so I decided to give it a go so I could quench my craving and take my guy's crawdad virginity, two birds, one stone and all that hullabaloo.   We got there and there was about a twenty minute wait.  We had to wait outside cause the place is pretty packed with tables.  We were seated and our server was very nice and took the time to explain how things worked.  You order your protein (crawdaddies, shrimp, soft-shelled crabs etc) by the pound and choose your seasoning (Cajun, garlic butter etc) and they bring them out in bags.  No plates in this place...the tables are draped in plastic, there are plastic bibs available...you may look sill but they are definitely needed, those suckers might be small but they are seriously messy!  This is not the place to go if you plan to do anything afterwards.    We ordered a couple pounds if crawfish with Cajun seasoning and an order of corn fritters.  I love spicy food, he doesn't.  It was a hit with us both, not too spicy and not too mild.  The fritters were divine and a good sized serving for the two of us.   The big bonus was the price.  The market price of the crawdaddies that day was $7/lb, the next day I was at the grocery store and there were frozen crawfish for $6.75 for a little under a pound and you still had to cook them and do the cleaning up afterwards.  I'd gladly pay a quarter more to not have to do the work!  I haven't stopped raving about this place and keep dropping hints as often as I can that I'm jonsin' to go back.  I see some more head suckin' in my future (the heads are where all the yummy bits are, if you don't suck the heads you are mission out!) See y'all soon lil mudbugs!",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about this place, so I was really excited to finally try it.  I was told in advance to get shrimp instead of the craw-fish so you don't have to do as much removing of shells.  The waits are long here and parking is very scarce up front, so be prepared to park on the side street.  The menu is very simple and the waitress is more than willing to explain how everything works.  We ordered a basket of the hot fries for the table and they lived up to their name.  As tasty as they were it's a good thing to split with a group because I imagine they wear on you in the long-run.  I decided on the Hot N Juicy special sauce shrimp.  They bring it out in a hot plastic bag and from there you go to town.  After an intro lesson from someone in our party, I was peeling shrimp faster and faster as the night went on.  It definitely is a lot of work peeling especially when the food is still a little hot, but on the plus side it slows your pace of eating so you don't eat too much!  After all was said and done the food was OK, It's been 3 days and I still have a hint of garlic smell on my hands and the next day when I went for a run my sweat smelled like the sauce!  For all the effort you put in I wish the food was better, but the experience is something to live.  Tip:  Make sure to not wear any fancy clothing and possibly ask for gloves so your hands don't stink for days.",

    "text": "First, I've never seen so much wasted food packaging in my life! I'm smiling when saying that humorously, but it's True!!! Styrofoam cups. Styrofoam bowls. Plastic bags. Paper napkins. Plastic table cloth.   Things to note- if you just got your nails did and are craving your seafood boil fix, never fear. Ask for plastic gloves. My mom brings her own dishwashing gloves to crawfish boils, but they will provide you some plastic ones upon request.   Took Yelper advice and got half a pound of shrimp. Shrimp were slightly overcooked. After you peel it, dunk it around in the sauce so it can get more flavor on it! Sauces are nice.   We also got the fried cajun calamari, and it's really not good... just generic fried frozen calamari that is overly tough. Don't get that.  Crawfish itself is not in season now, so expectation management is always important. They will likely inform you that it is frozen. A pound of it won't get you very far though.    Some of the girls working there will tell you \"mild\" is actually \"medium\" for most people, but I would disagree. Mild tastes like \"mild\" with just a minor punch to it.  Service was great. The girls working were all very sweet and nice.  For calamari, half a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, a half order of sausage, two potatoes, and a Diet Coke, our total was $33 before tip. It's not exactly cheap for frozen seafood. A fun experience for locals that have no where else to turn for a seafood boil, but a little on the price-heavy side.",

Their menus & concepts are practically identical yet the 2 are quite different~   Atmosphere: I prefer BC! The restaurant is huge with plenty of TVs and I love how you can tag up their walls ~  Service: BC wins! Their servers are always smiley & happy! I love how they put your bibs on for you~  Quality: I think it's a tie! Both places have always had fresh seafood! Yummmmmy! And they usually have the same prices~   Corn/Potatoes/Sausage: For some reason they taste better at BC.. they just do!   Special Sauce: I prefer the Hot & Juicy special sauce over the whole shabang! It has a stronger deeper flavor and you can definitely taste the garlic! BC can sometimes be way too salty for me..  Overall, The Boiling Crab wins but not by that much! I still like to eat at both places ~",

My friend mentioned the better deal is the shrimp as you get more meat than the crawfish!  So we ordered a bag of shrimp with sausage each.  I also ordered some rice to soak up the juice!    We prepared for the meal by putting on the clothes-protecting bibs that they provide you!    2 bags came out and we digged in.  Man... the flavour of the sauce with garlic is just amazing!  Let me say however that there is a ton of garlic!  So much garlic that it stayed on my palate the whole night.  However it's totally worth it for the experience.    To wash it down we had a couple of Blue Moon's!    So damm tasty!  These places don't come around very often!",

Our waitress talked us out of the medium spice, if it's your first time order mild.  It was pretty spicy... the ca-gin fries are a bit spicy too.   The second time we went wasn't as spicy but still good  They'll give you a bib and gloves if you want.  They also have a small dish you can ask for on the side that has salt and pepper, which you squeeze lemon juice that makes another winner dipping sauce.",

We managed to beat the crowd at this location, so don't get me wrong, there was a line around noon. The crawfish was delicious swimming in all that butter and garlic flavor, and that's what makes it good. Other places will advertise garlic butter as a seasoning choice, but it's actually being mixed in oil, garlic and Cajun seasoning so that you can't tell that it's not butter. Order corn and potatoes on the side and it comes in a separate bag soaked in its own butter bath. Definitely coming back whenever we can.",

We have a couple places similar on Oahu but it doesn't come close to HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!  Anyway, what can I say about this place...only that it's complete heaven! Lol the best time to go is as soon as they open which is at 12 noon because you'll be waiting any other time of the day.  Your waiter/ waitress will set you up with a bib just so you don't get any of their sauce all over your clothes. Just an FYI...this is where you can get down and dirty...no need to worry about being proper...just use your hands, dig in and go for broke!  We always order the crawfish, shrimp, fresh oysters, and shrimp etouffee!  It's always so full of flavor and so satisfying. It might take a while to get your food but this is one place it's worth the wait!  I have no complaints with customer service....they were always there to check up on us and make sure we were okay!  I can't wait to go back!!! See you soon HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!!! Maybe we'll go check out their new location near Chinatown!",

    "text": "Came here to give this place another shot since I had a really strong craving for some fresh crawfish.  My boyfriend and I decided to do a late lunch here and ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (one corn and one potato included with each 2 pound order) and 1 pound of shrimp hot and juicy style baby spice, along with a cup of rice, and our drinks.   First of all, here's a tip: if you usually get mild or some sort of spice anywhere else, I suggest you do baby spice. I ordered the mild here last time and it was comparable to medium elsewhere. The baby spice definitely has a kick to it.  The food came out pretty quick, which is awesome because I was starving! The crawfish was very fresh! The size definitely differs but you usually get a pretty average size crawfish. I personally like to order shrimp and crawfish at the same time so I feel like I'm eating more meat without putting so much work into peeling them open! The shrimp was a little overcooked, I know this because the shell kept sticking onto the meat which made it a tad more difficult to peel.   After we were done with our food, I actually ordered two more corns (in sauce of course) just because of how sweet and delicious they were. Definitely hit the spot.  My only downfall to my review is that they didn't offer to refill our drinks and we had to let the server know we would like a refill as we were paying for our check. In addition to that, no one really checked up on us and I felt like I didn't know which server was our designated server.   My suggestions would be to zone people out to ensure they are covering the guest in their zone with 100% customer service.   Hopefully the 4th times a charm!",

Once we ordered they brought out the good in big plastic bags, steaming hot. However, there are no sides included, and limited sides to add on even if you choose to.  It didn't get one star because Laura was great. She kept our completely flat sodas refilled, and checked back on us frequently.  Also, the corn fritters were delicious. I would say stop by and ask to sit in Laura's station, get the fritters and one kind of seafood, a beer or water, and if you're still hungry go next door for desert or up the street to Ronald's Donuts.  Really overpriced for what it is, I think.",

    "text": "After living on the MS Gulf Coast for 30 years and having the best Cajun food in New Orleans, my husband and I are always on the lookout for Cajun cuisine.  Prior to going to Las Vegas I Googled Cajun restaurants and found one that had great reviews.  While in Vegas I mentioned to someone the restaurant I found and going to try and was told to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.   The aroma of the seafood made our mouths water walking in.  We waited 20 minutes or so for a table.  We ordered a combo dinner that included 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp, Andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob.  My husband likes heat so he chose the Hot N Juicy Special Seasoning and the Extra Spicy spice level.   We also ordered 1lb of shrimp with Louisiana Style seasoning and the Mild Spice level, which had a nice flavorful kick to it.  We also had another pound of shrimp with the Juicy Cajun Seasoning and the medium spice level which was flavorful but definitely hot. They serve everything in separate bags per the seasoning and spice level.  The tables are covered with a throw away plastic cover which is where the heads and shells are tossed.  We loved the atmosphere, food, and super friendly staff.  The only small negative thing to mention is that the shrimp were hard to peel and a few mushy which usually means the shrimp is not the freshest.  Didn't effect the taste though!  Happy to read they are opening one in the Planet Hollywood Casino on the strip.  We will definitely go back!!",

After reading other yelpers complaints about the service, wait, etc. at Hot N' Juicy, I felt compelled to disagree after eating here a couple of weeks ago.   When the bf and I arrived for dinner the place was packed (always a good sign as I learned in San Francisco) but we were seated fairly quickly considering.  I'm usually a fan of a more refined dining experience but I found the no-frills, bid and paper towel decor very utilitarian.  All of the staff we encountered were great, especially our server (I think her name was Shawna) who was wonderfully sweet and helpful.  She made the awesome recommendation of the Hot N' Juicy sauce (spicy cause that's the way I like it) and gave us invaluable pointers on how exactly to attack the 3lbs of crawfish, crab and shrimp (\"you gotta suck the head!\").    Other than the awesome crustaceans the best part of our meal was finding out they're opening an San Francisco location.  If the SF outpost has the same great quality food and servers like ours you can bet we'll be regulars!",

This place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. I think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. The hot n juicy special sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. Id recommend requesting the potatoes and putting them inside the bag. The only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. Crab legs are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable.",

Being charged $9.99/lb for the crawfish, they were disappointedly small. I thought the crawfish were brought in from Louisiana.  The sauce had great taste went really well with white rice. Presentation of the product was not what I expected.... The servers were in very casually clothing but the decor didn't go with the atmosphere. The atmosphere has a sports bar feel but the decor was a lil too formal for me. My husband was disappointed. After we left this place we were still hungry. Disappointingly hungry. Should of had Chinese food instead. This place is over rated.",

My companions and I really went to work. There was more slurping/sucking noises than conversating going on...good thing. I love me some shrimp brains. We also ordered a whole dungeness that was deelicious.   The crawdads looked a little beat up though, meaning the shells were cracked on a lot of dads like they had been roughly handled or crushed. Maybe a little less fresh than what I'm use to in the bay area.  Your hands are gonna smell like sea food for at least a full day but it's worth it. The heat had me waking up in the middle of the night a few times for a visit to Toto but this was expected.   I'd definitely come here again next time I'm in Vegas.

    "text": "Okay, I can see why this place gets a bunch fo 4 stars.    This was my first time eating crawfish as was it for my wife.  So first off, we get there and the place is full, no waiting, just full of people enjoying their dinner.  We had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  That was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  Then we did a quick Yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.  While Yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  Much better, so we headed on over.  Like I said, the first time we've had crawfish.   The first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  The server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.  We ordered crawfish and crab legs.  Both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  We also ordered calamari and sweet potato fries.  Everything was good.  Now, this is NOT A FIRST DATE PLACE.  But if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  Half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  In fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).  This place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' Southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish.",

I had eaten here about 6 months earlier and liked it, but the spicy option was so spicy it made my lips literally peel. I do not mean literally like most kids today do. I mean, it LITERALLY made the skin come off of my lips. I normally can take a lot of spice, but the combo in the spicy option was way too much for me. I enjoyed it while eating it, but the next few days were torture. The next trip I ordered the lowest grade of spice (can't remember the name) and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was still nicely spicy, but no loss of skin. :) The sauce is very flavorful, so much so that I ordered extra biscuits just to dunk in the sauce. I am not a bread girl and normally pass on it. I've seen complaints that the crawfish are expensive for the amount of meat involved, but I felt the pricing was very fair. You will NOT be able to replicate the sauce at home and the crawfish itself is priced close to market. You MUST check this place out, you will be happy you did!",

I never even liked garlic before Hot N Juicy; the place permeates with a deep garlicky, buttery smell as soon as you drive up (and so will you for 3 days after you eat here).  Get the crawfish, get the shrimp, get the crab, but whatever you do, get it in the special sauce.  There's something in that \"SPECIAL\" sauce that's indescribable but keeps me coming back week after week - could it be crack, could it be heroin?  I don't know, but I'm an addict for life.  If I ever become allergic to shellfish (knock on wood), my family have specific instructions to put me outta my misery.  Or, I'll just die eating at my favorite restaurant Hot N Juicy.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed; the wait is worth it.  Go before 6pm to avoid a looooong wait.  It's busy all days of the week.  Make sure to get the corn, some sausages and add a bowl of rice to catch all the juices as they run off your hands when cracking the crawfish, shrimp, and crab.  Squeeze the head juice into the rice for extra flavor.  Eat the rice last, yum!  Damn you Adam Richman for telling everyone about Las Vegas locals' best hole-in-the-wall seafood place.  I feel sorry for the tourists that do try Hot N Juicy and then go home craving it because it's so amazing - I'm lucky to be living here in LV so I can eat there whenever I want!!!  I'm waiting to hear someone say they moved to LV for Hot N Juicy LOL!  I just checked out the Boiling Crab in San Jose and Hot & Juicy is stll the winner in my book.  Sauce is more buttery and savory and the servers are the greatest here in LV.",

    "text": "My boyfriend saw this place on Man Vs. Food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip.   Not bad. We arrived at 12:30PM ready for seafood. Yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. The item they are known for! UNACCEPTABLE! We came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. The waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. First off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so our seafood here is FRESH. Yet I had to remind myself that Vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely.   We rolled our eyes and blew the joint. I swear I would be back but for the rest of the day I was getting puppy eyes from the honey so I agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.  We arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. We ordered a pound of Hot & Juicy Special in Medium and one pound of shrimp in Garlic Butter medium and a side of sweet potato fries. First off there is not one positive thing that I can recall about the fries so I would recommend ordering a bowl of rice instead. Yes, order rice over fries. I never thought I would recommend that to anyone. Ever.  My favorite flavor was the Hot & Juicy! It was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! The Garlic Butter was good too! I would both order them again. The heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. I would beware the extra spicy!   The place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and I was happy we arrived fairly early. The service here is lagging. You have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. They don't really pay attention the details.   I would go back if I lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next Vegas trip or any after I will not be visiting Hot and Juicy. It was good, but it wasn't THAT good.   (I took off a star for not having crawfish when I went initially FYI)  OH and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. The amount of soap didn't matter. The order sinks in! Kinda yucky.  Happy ripping off the heads of crawfish!   (=",

(of course) -fingerlickin good, tear ducts watering, nose running....yumminess. -Softshell crab (comes with fries) - good -4 corn - same ole, same ole  Environment Fairly clean. Wooden tables, some booths, casual.  Service Decent. Waitress was okay, a little ditzy, but okay.   Tip When u get there, the person taking your name down for the waitlist may say, \"go to the other NEW location down the block, there is no wait.\" WRONG, do not listen. We were smart enough to put our name on the list then check out the \"new\" location....yup, even looongger wait!  Lame. So we went back to the original location and waited just 15 minutes! Not much parking, so CARPOOL or go early!",

We were greeted by a young lady at the door and she tells us the wait time is about 45 minutes  to an hour wait. So we decided to just place an order to go (we didn't want to bother with the wait). So we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of the crawfish. It took about 30 - 50 minutes for the cooks to finish with our order. So finally we made it home, we opened up the bags and I dig IN with full force!!! Wow, the shrimp and the crawfish was full of exploding spicy flavors. Here's a tip, spoon out some of the sauce and dip your crustacean in the sauce! Its delicious! So don't get afraid of getting your hands messy!",

I have to say that the shrimps are definitely sweeter than I ever remember them, even from way before. Yum yum yum, rock on :D  I also appreciate her thoughtful efforts in pleasing her customers, a rare quality to be seen these days in restaurant owners. I don't live in the area anymore, so I won't be visiting often, however, I took my mom with me on the recent visit and made a big fan out of her. She can't eat the shrimp because of her low sodium diet, but loved the taste and is excited to use HNJ to cater her next house party :)  P.S. The Cajun Fries are way spicier than I remember, I'm not sure if it's my memory or not, but I think I'll get plain ones next time. The House sauce is still deliciously tangy as always!!",

Waiter was informed about us being newbie but did not mention about the sides being mixed with the crawfish. Waiter gave us a check with additional items on it and the total bill was double the price. We asked the waiter to correct it but then the bill was still wrong.",

    "text": "Honestly, if I have never been to the Boiling Crab in San Jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  I just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  Some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  Seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  He explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a Cajun restaurant.  My lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!  We ordered snow crab legs since the blue crab and the dungeness crab were out (that was upsetting).  We got it with the Hot n Juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  It comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  It was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  Just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries.  Maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  They were soggy and gross.  This is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  I would definitely come here again.  Do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!",

We did get the snow crabs (so tender), the shrimp (big chunk of meat), clams (juicy), and the corn. The corn is really good, being soaked up in all the goodness of juice/sauce. Then combine all that salty food, and down it with Corona and lime, that's a damn good meal!",

Cons: 1) Did not fall madly in love with crawfish...but did like it. I guess we all preferred the shrimp....still it was fun. 2) Mild is still spicey! Be aware that the regular is spicy. I eat like a spice virgin soooooo kinda my own fault.  ( neither con is really anything wrong with them....just preferences..)  Overall it was a great experience and I would go back again!

Styrofoam cups, plastics table coverings & rolls of papers on the table. I don't think there is a plate to be found in the building. While there all you see are people licking, sucking & eating as well as picking out the newbies to eating crawfish.  As for the wait, I've never experienced it although I've seen it. I always seem to get there @ the perfect time. Just so you know, you can order take out & it seems as if I enjoyed that better, then I could go home & really pig out.  Just know that you want to roll in there in something you don't mind getting butter on. You just can't help it.

    "text": "I am a humble local food critic, and I have to give one star to Hot and Juicy. We have been to this location on NUMEROUS occasions. Every time we went, we ate inside, and loved the food!! The last two times, we got takeout. Boy, was that a horrible idea!! Mind you, we have to drive 30 minutes to get there, and 30 minutes to get home. The first time we got takeout, the pound of snow crab and the 4, that's right, 4 pounds of crawfish were cooked in the wrong sauce and WAY too spicy. My friend was visiting from out of town, and is a breastfeeding mother. Her snow crab was so hot, it was practically on fire. Brutal. I called and talked to the manager Olena. She said she would comp the pound of snow crab and the 4 pounds of crawfish. I was pissed, but I was satisfied because we really liked the food normally. A week later, on 9/20/2014, I decided to order takeout again. Bad freaking idea AGAIN!! I didn't call it in this time, because I wanted to make sure we would get what Olena promised me. I order. Of course. Olena only comped us 2 pounds of crawfish. I was upset, but there was no manager there for me to talk to, so I just paid for the extra two pounds. We also ordered rice, shrimp, and an order of catfish and fries to go. Our order comes out, the guy that brought it out quickly goes through it. He says it's all there. I say thanks and walk out. As we are driving away, I think about the catfish and fries. I didn't remember seeing it. So, I look in the bag. ITS NOT IN THE BAG. UGH!! And of course it's 5:00 traffic. 5 mins later I walk back in to get the catfish. I look at the same lady that helped us and she grabs the bag sitting on the counter. Wtf? I guess she already knew that they forgot, and they were WAITING for me to come back. So frustrating. Here is the worst part: As I'm walking out, I glance back and all the staff behind the counter are laughing about it. Seriously? Is this how you train your staff? I realize they are all 15, but come on. We will be going to the Boiling Crab from now on. Too many broken promises and horrible customer service....",

Although it gets a little messy, I'd say it's a fun social outing to do with friends....now if you're alone, then that's a different story.  I discovered this place a few months after it opened up, and went back every 2 weeks to get it.  I was on the \"Hot N Juicy\" fever.  You do get a little stench of seafood delight for two days, but it's well worth it to me.    I usually order: - 1 lb of Butter Garlic shrimp with 1/2 a dozen sausages, and a potato --- no spice, cause somehow it's still spicy. And shrimp, cause it's more meat. - Cajun and sweet potato fries (cause I can never chose which one I like best)  Always ask for salt, pepper, and lime for the dipping sauce.  To me, it just makes everything taste better, and save some of the lime for your hands.  It tries to remove the smell, just a little bit.",

Paid 60 for 4 crablegs, they tasted good, but they forgot to bring out half our order. They acted rude when we suggested they forgot half our order. Corn was good, king crab was great. Next time I will stick to blue crab, fried shrimp and crawfish for the value. Over all the food was over priced, tasted ok, but the service was terrible. The plastic bag thing was interesting, but it was loud with no music. Bathrooms were disgusting!",

    "text": "My brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. It was good the last time I went, but it wasn't impressive that I was dying to go back. I was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. I guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.  Ordered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in HNJ sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen raw oysters, and rice. I've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. The shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. The clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. I guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. After trying the sausages in other sauces, I still prefer the HNJ as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. I was a tad miffed last time I came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. Asians rejoice!  My family liked this place so that's good. Sometimes being a Yelper everyone thinks you know ALL the things and I feel pressure being different in food taste too.   Service was great. Very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. I really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. Only helps them to faster turnover.  Of course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! My nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. They give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. Cracking shells is a splatter hazard.   Yeah, this place is hyped to hell and I don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. Sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. If only it came with a sea view, I would feel complete.",

Then I saw it featured by Adam Richmond, on Man VS Food! I've been wanting to try it, ever since.  Tonight, I was able to try it. I must say my favorite dish is Crawfish Etouffee! I was disappointed that they only offer it, as a side dish.  I had a pound of Crawfish, which was fresh, tasty, but very hard to eat! I found myself struggling to get some meat!   They serve it in a bag, with no utensils, so don't wear a long sleeve shirt, because it's messy. With that said, be prepared to freeze before getting your meal... I'm not sure why they run the AC so high, but once you dig in to your meal, it will warm you up.    I would suggest going in there with at least 3 people, and sharing. They offer more than crawfish. They have shrimp, lobster, oysters, and many forms of crab.  They need to clean the bathrooms more! My wife told me the Women's bathroom was a mess, and when I went into the men's room,  I had to stand way back, to not step in pee.  I look forward to going back. Although a few negative aspects of the place, the food is well priced, and delicious. It's the only place in town I've had fresh crawfish... So I have nothing to compare it to. I believe it's the only place in town that has crawfish flown in daily!",

The concept is brilliant - pick your seafood, pick your quantity and pick your seasoning (or just fry it).  No muss, no fuss.  Prices are relatively cheap and the food is tasty.  Our server was great and we really didn't wait long to be seated (maybe 5 minutes).  In that respect, I guess we were lucky with parking too, but I can see how it may be a cluster on other nights.

We usually start off with oysters, I forgot to ask what kind of oysters they were but they usually come pretty quick and they were good, fresh, cleaned well, and a good size.  And sometimes we get the Cajun fries but they can be a little too spicy. The sweet potato fries are really good though.  Then the rest of the food.. I like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. Some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. I also get a half dozen sausages in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. And a bowl of rice.  They say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. They also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. Since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary.   Their sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. I've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like Old Bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but HnJ's is on point.  I love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. I'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. Either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!",

The sausage here is sweet, and goes well with the flavor we choose. It does have a kick, so make sure you have water and beer.",

    "text": "I've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  They say its more flavorful so I went with a group of friends to try it out.  I LOVE boiling crab!  The only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!  When i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  The place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   Menu is about the same too.  They have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, fried shrimp etc.  For the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except lemon pepper, 4 corns, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce.   The food came quickly...and we were ready.  This place offers gloves but I say ditch it.  They are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  The hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  We went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  Not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  Some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  I forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  Corn was really good too!  Corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so I'm glad it was sweet and juicy.  The clams were very flavorful.  They soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  You just get less food for the money though.  All in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  I do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  I mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  We killed everything!  And at boiling crab I usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 corns and am STUFFED.  The sauce here is also a lot thinner.  Boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  I personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  Room for improvement but I would come here any day over the hour wait.",

When we told our waitress it's our first time, she gladly told us how it worked and we got acquainted with the menu very fast.  My partner had the crawfish and I had shrimp, we shared the black mussels. All were fresh and the sauces were nothing short of tasty. Hard to choose a favourite, but I'd say the Cajun one was fantastic. Be warned: the extreme spicy took me by welcome surprise, as i love spicy food. Please be careful and get your server to explain the levels of spices to you. Overall a pleasant experience, my partner cannot wait to come back. My only gripe is the potatoes.. why aren't they cut into half at least? Lol.",

Their sauce was bomb and their portions were pretty large considering the price. Believe them when they say they're a little spicier than most places.

We ended up getting the drool which came with a lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, dozen andouille sausages, 2 corn, 2 potatoes, 1/2 lb of snow crab and your choice of regular or Cajun calamari (get the Cajun!)

We didn't get the super hot but we got the hot and spicy sauce, it was so good having a couple beers with it too. I also have to give honorable mention to their water. The water selection was great Las Vegas tap water on ice. I don't know why but maybe it was the heat that my mouth was experiencing. The water was so good it cooled me off right. There were six family members in my party. We sat down to a feast of oceanic abundance. We love dungeons crab. And it was prepared deliciously with the hot and juicy sauce. The shrimp was to die for. Not overdone, just right. The crayfish was prepared just as good. The muscles or steam perfectly they could have used a little more of the hot and juicy sauce but because we had so much other food there all we did was take our muscles import them into one of the other empty bags that had a ton of the hot spicy seasoning in it a little bit of improvising doesn't hurt anyone it normally helps everybody out. The corn was slightly overcooked but was so delicious we overlooked that situation. As for the poor boy and the fried fish to the other family members had that I can't tell you exactly how that was but I will say this there was nothing left great location gray venue I come back here every year when I'm in Vegas I think you should too especially if you love spicy Seafood",

Now what sets this place apart from other seafood joints (besides the amazing food) is the dining experience. You are provided a bib if you so choose and some eating gloves. The food is served in clear plastic bags reminiscent of those that are used in the fish market at my neighborhood supermarket. But now the food, that is what makes this place a must visit. Whatever you order, I highly recommend you order it with their signature Hot n Juicy Sauce! That alone is what makes the meal! Take what ever seafood you ordered and just swim it into that sauce and eat it! You're taste buds will be transported into a place of foodie harmony!",

Same concept applies as Boiling Crab, you choose what kind of seafood you want, any extras inside the bag (potatoes, corn, sausage etc.,) and then your seasoning and spice levels.  I got: 1lb shrimp Flavor: Hot N Juicy  Spice: Baby spice  My boyfriend got: 1/2 shrimp w/ 1 lb sausage  Flavor: Hot N Juicy  Spice: EXTRA SPICY (TBC XXX is spicer)  It felt like love at first bite, I loved the sweetness of the sauce. It goes great with rice and lemon with salt and paper. They also offer many selections on fried food items/appetizers, I wish I got the chance to try them but there's always next time. They do offer gloves, which is nice and makes eating more convenient and comfortable.  The only reason why I'm giving it a four star is due to cleanliness. The girls bathroom needs a little attention, the paper towel dispenser wasn't working, there was trash everywhere. It was just harder to clean up after yourself, especially after a dirty meal but other than that everything was great.",

Came here a little while ago with some out of town friends and had a 30 minute wait for a group of 6 which seems to be the norm now since its been on TV foodie shows. Compared to the first time I came here there was no wait. Once we were seated we were quickly served by the cute waitresses whom a friend repeatedly flirted with but was shot down ;P  We ordered several 2lbs bags of crawfish in different flavors and several appetizers like the catfish, fried shrimp, and soft shell crabs. Everything was spiced nicely which they inform(warn) you that it is hotter than you might expect. The crawfish is live when they are cooked we were told, and that frozen were available because some peeps don't like it for some reason but I do notice the meat is a lot more tender.

I'll echo some of the other reviewers, if you go for dinner, go early, as the line builds up.  We were seated right away, at 5:30, but by 6:30, there was a line outside the door.  I had the crawfish and clams, medium spice, and my mouth was burning for a couple of hours after we left (and I am usually pretty tolerant of spicy foods).  I also made the mistake of touching my eye, even after washing my hands, it still burned badly.  Loved both the clams and crawfish.  My wife is not a crawfish fan, so she got chicken wings, which were apparently good as well.",

I got here at about 8pm on a Friday night and didn't have to wait for a table.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful.  She recommended her favs and gave great suggestions. The four of us ordered 3 lbs. shrimp, 1 lb. king crab legs, a lobster which was about 1.5 lbs. , and 4 corns.  We all liked the shrimp the best and found it very fun to peel the shells off.  We also all liked the hot n juicy sauce the best, which was a mixture of  all their sauces.  The medium spicy level was more than enough!  I recommend dipping your seafood into the sauce after you peel it out of its shell!  YUM! I minused one star because they were out of the dungeness crab, they also shorted us 1 corn, and the lobster took very very long to come out (I think they accidentally forgot about it until we reminded them). But this was a great dinner and a great experience and also very affordable!",

FRESH crawfish is definitely a MUST. We tried the frozen ones since they ran out of fresh ones and it didn't do justice. The cajun sauce medium was tough to handle.. Whenever we go here, it's always a hit or miss; always too hot. Also, the last time we went here, we got charged over $50 because of miscommunication with the servers. So, make sure that your tab is accurate or else, you will spend 30 minutes trying to figure it out with the main server. I think our server was new and granted that we had a big party, we were very patient with her.",

Compared with all the cajun style crawfish and shrimp place in Vegas, this place is actually awesome. For those who compared this place to other places in California, DON'T. THIS IS NOT CALIFORNIA. My buddies and I made quite regular visit to this place when we want a place to drink and munch on some good seafood.  Cold beer + spicy shrimp/crawfish = yum yum. One advice - the dungent crab is very expensive and doesn't absorb the sauce flavor good, so all you have is one expensive steamlike crab.",

Sometimes we order takeout and drive roundtrip from Henderson to get it.  We had the cajun-style crawfish this time, two pounds each - as well as the catfish.  We wanted the etoufee, but they were out.  Hubby said the next time we discuss going to Hush Puppies for catfish, remind him to go to Hot n' Juicy instead.  I got the medium spiciness and hubby got the spicy and we were both wincing at the heat.  The Blue Moon beer helped with that.  I have to say that I prefer the shrimp to the crawfish - for the \"more meat\" argument that previous reviewers have noted.  I also like ordering sausage to add to the mix.  I have yet to try the dungeness or blue crab, I guess I never go during the right season.  I'd give this place a five if I hadn't had crawfish in Louisiana.  No place beats Dwights in Lafayette.",

I love eating really really spicy foods and the medium spiciness I ordered had just enough kick for me.  My friends ordered crab legs and crawfish marinated in the Hot n Juicy special but I think the shrimp is able to soak more of the delicious marinade and easier to peel.  Heck, I even ate the shrimp's head and I don't normally eat the shrimp's head =)  The marinade is that good!  I'll never be able to go back to Hawaii and eat expensive Giovanni's or any other shrimp trucks again.  Giovanni who?  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat there again!",

It's filled with the spice that you chose, corn on the cob and a potato. What makes these craw fish so good is the seasonings used. There's a few different flavor choices. I always get the special. It's all of the flavors together. Then there is the Spice level. Beware! Spicy is Spicy! I have yet to try the Extra Spicy. There are no utensils or plates. You eat off the plastic table cloth and you even get a bib. I was never a fan of craw fish until now. One of my favorite places in Vegas.",

I saw mainly Asians, and wondered why. Are these people from out of town or are they locals? Anyhow, it was definitely worth our short 25 minute (instead of the 15 quoted) wait for our hot n juicy seafood. We ordered some shrimp, crab, corn and potatoes. All were delicious, and our waitress was helpful in verbally assisting two crab dissecting virgins. We got through the meal happy, and with one cut on my finger, nothing too bad.

My favorite was the lemon pepper and the hot n juicy was a very close second. I would pass on the ragin cajun next time. We also ordered corn, which soaked up all the delicious flavor. I always have to have corn at these crawfish joints.   I know the place is called hot n juicy CRAWFISH and a lot of people love crawfish...but it is a lot of work for a very small pay-off. Because of that, I think shrimp is the best way to go!! I love peeling the shell off and then dipping the shrimp meat back into the juice.   For the Bay Area people, this place is a lot better than that other crawfish place in Oakland and maybe at the same level (or better) as the uber-popular one in San Jose. I might even rank it higher than the place in San Jose because the sauce doesn't seem as buttery and artery-clogging.   Can't wait to go back!",

I ordered a pound of the crawfish, with the Hot N Juicy special sauce, mild.  Threw in a potato and some corn on the cob.  Even the mild had a good kick to it.  My lips tingled for an hour after I was done eating.  Sweet potato fries were good too.  Their crawfish were humungous when I was there.  About 3 inches in length, compared to the 1.5 inch ones I get at the Boiling Crab in So Cal.  The only thing I wish is that the sauce had chunks of garlic in it.  That's what I love.  On a bad note, my husband said their wings totally sucked.  I didn't try them but they did look really small.  HNJ is a couple bucks more expensive than Boiling Crab in Ca.  Parking sucks.  There was a 20 minute wait for four people on a Monday night.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Overall, I'm a fan and would go back.",

    "text": "We went here in the middle of December.  After all the reviews and raves our expectations were high.  Unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster.  The waitress was excited they had fresh crawfish.  I've had fresh crawfish and these were a poor representation.  They may have been fresh but were so small and overcooked you couldn't get the meat out of the tail.    The chef needs to learn to take the DEAD ones out before boiling the live ones.  Mushy, runny and crushed.  I think they leave them in there to keep the pounds up.  $10.99 for one pound.  Again VERY disappointed.  I don't know how their crab or shrimp or was, but a pound of the crawfish we were given had as much tail meat as maybe 4 shrimp I saw at the other table.  The waitress was attentive but didn't seem to be concerned with our dissatisfaction. Thank the lord there was a Quiznos a block away.  The sauce was good, we ordered the extra spicy and it was pretty tame.  Like most things in Vegas, the hype beats the experience.  We won't be back, but maybe the other seafood would be worth your time.",

    "text": "After years of living here, I tried going in. When I left, I found out something very disturbing as to why I haven't before. It has nothing to do with the establishment or reputation, so don't let that dissuade you.  Out front, you see that it's in a strip mall and it's not a huge place. You go inside and it has the feel of a sports bar, but with a lot of families and bustle going on all around. Right away you see piles of napkins, bibs and seafood debris. No, it's not Aria, but that's what I like. People were comfortable eating with their hands, doing what needed to be done to get to their dinner locked in various shells and exoskeletons.  Service was the first and lasting thing I noticed. Someone sat me, and while I was deciding, 2 others came up to ask me if I was ready, what I may need, what to drink, etc. It was a tag team effort I appreciated. I have worked a lot of restaurants, and I know you have maybe 4-5 tables to take care of and honestly, 99% of servers don't give a shit about tables not in their section, \"they're not tipping ME,\" or if the the customer has a problem with them, it blows YOUR tip. But here, servers help every table they walk by.   There were people waiting to be seated and 2 large groups were less than half occupying their tables pushed together. The only problems I had in this is seeing the solution. Some restaurants have a policy of not seating large groups until they all arrive which is how the first should have been handled. With the campers at the other party, I have and seen other servers take a table as people from the large group leave to set it up for a new 2/4 top.   The tables are funny, the table cloth is plain white plastic and the napkins are rolls of paper towels. I find it comforting because they don't mess around, there is high volume picking and peeling going on here.  The menu is a simple piece of paper with most options listed on it and the spiciness of how you want it prepared. Aside from crawfish, there's shrimp, crab, much more. Damn, I can't find my copy of the menu they let me have... They also sell sides, so I got rice expecting some broth with my order. I ordered a medium spicy combo. I can talk about different types of spicy all day, scoville units, the whole thing. But this had a nice lingering spiciness to it. Drinking soda (acids) doesn't help extinguish spicy food, but I was being good because I had to drive. No, beer wouldn't have helped, either. It may help some people to bring antacid if they want to show off.  Ask them what the market rate prices are listed on the menu so you can compare, or don't get surprised.  Dinner was served, a server unceremoniously plopped a pound bag of crawfish on my table. Hahahaha. Rice came a few minutes later and I was already in my plastic bag. Crawfish is big in my family and I'm from the bay area. There is a LOT of work busting open the shells, sucking the heads and getting what little meat there is out. They had bibs and I opted to not get one, I thought I was a big shot. I didn't have a nutcracker either. You can tell some of the pros in the restaurant, they brought their own. But the shell was soft enough to bend and snap the claws (tip, snap towards the front of the bag, or rice bowl). The head can be scary to eat, there's cartilage and bits and things that I was used to having in a soup, hence the rice. It was a bed I let everything drip onto. People complain about how small they are, but you WANT that, the smaller ones growing have more flavor, just like peppers. You don't want a large or genetically engineered huge crawfish.  This is where it gets personal. To be honest with you, I haven't had crawdads in years since I worked at the Orleans buffet. But that was once and part of a larger meal. Before that, it was decades. I had a rush of all kinds of family situations and get togethers and people attacking crawdads. It's not like shrimp, there's a lot more savage carnivorous behavior in eating crawfish. I felt like I took the easy route with all the shrimp cocktail and larger crustaceans I've had in town.  And there were a lot more memories than I was prepared for.  I made the mistake of reading some of the others reviews. Their complaints seem to be about places outside of the valley which I disregard. Everyone knows the south has better crawfish, \"...everything is trucked into Vegas.\" But IN the valley, there's nothing like it.  I had about a quarter pound left to go for later, paid my tab. They have tee shirts there, which is nice. There's no greater advertisement I think than the local's place tee shirt. \"Everything okay?\" \"Everything was fine, just a little spicy, baby doll\" I lied. My eyes were red and teary from 25 years plus dormant memories.",

They waitress was very polite and held a quick conversation while taking our orders. Service was prompt and the food was up to its usual greatness; all around fantastic once again at Hot N Juicy!",

    "text": "I've been dying to try this place since I moved to Vegas late last year. It's a well known chain restaurant, basically the Boiling Crab of Vegas (if you're from California).   I was greeted and sat immediately by Edgar who also served me. It was a full house around 8-9 on a Wednesday evening, as expected so I guess I got pretty lucky. Service was as good as it could get considering how busy it was.   I ordered a pound of Shrimp, medium in spice in their signature Hot N' Juicy sauce with corn, potatoes, half a pound of sausage & Hawaiian bread. And a side order of their garlic butter sauce.   I was starving. The bread & side garlic butter sauce came out together first within minutes of sending my order in.  The Hawaiian Bread was soft, warm & fresh, it was delicious and so was the garlic sauce. I noticed the garlic was a little crunchier than most boil places, so that was new. I liked it.   The rest I my order came in a few minutes later. The Shrimp was a very good size and perfectly cooked. The sausage slices were a little small.. I didn't really care for them but to be fair I'm not a big fan of pork or sausage.   The famed Hot N' Juicy Sauce.  After all the hype, I'm gonna have to say I'd prefer the Garlic butter over it. Just a preference I guess.   The Breakdown:  They don't mix the sauces like Boiling Crab or other places, so it's either one or the signature HNJ sauce but you can always order them separately and mix them yourself. That's what I did.   Prices. Their M/K *Market Price for their seafood was a little up there but again the Shrimp was a good size and so was the other seafood I saw that came out.   Another waitress Neri who also closed me out was very friendly and had the brightest energy in the room. Service was fine overall. I would definitely come back.",

The shrimp and crawfish are fairly priced and delicious with the hot n juicy sauce. BUT Be advised that if you are comparing the spiciness to that of boiling crab...this place is SPICIER.  (Example: the medium signature hot n juicy sauce is on a spicier scale than the medium house sauce at boiling crab and has been for a couple of years consistently :) )  The service is okay. I've had good service here and not so great service here in the past. This time around was a bit confusing. (MLK Monday afternoon around 3-4pm). We were greeted at the front and told to wait after giving my name and Party, then greeted again where the host asked for my name and party size again. After she walked away, another person asked if we were being helped. -_-  [STORY: During dinner, the main hostess who seated us also took our drink orders...then a man who's name tag said \"lead waiter\" asked for the same thing. Ended up ordering food with him, and getting food by her. He checked up on us regularly, and refilled our waters a couple times. Ordered salt and pepper with her, and she forgot twice...and brought it after asking the man.   The table next to us complained about not having bibs, not being offered gloves, not having utensils with their rice, and needing things quicker]  I think this place is definitely good... The restrooms have become cleaner, but should be checked more routinely for soap. Service is up and down, but either we came on a training day or a little communication between waiters/waitresses would be helpful...and annoy less customers :)",

Has the same feel as the other hot and juicy restaurant down the street which is also in spring mountain but is a bit smaller. I believe this was their original location and the inside is still super nice and has a casual ambience.   The service was great as was the food. The sauce is a bit spicy since it does have Cajun spices in the sauce but I really like how they have an option to get baby spice instead of mild or medium spice.   Our server was super nice and very attentive to our many requests. I never knew but our server also said if we would check in we would be getting free deep fried brownies. They were so delicious and we got 16 pieces because we didn't know they came 8 per check in on yelp or Facebook. I will for sure be coming back to this location in the future.",

People do not play when it comes to seafood boils because there were already quite a bit of customers already getting their grub on. We got seated right away. I ordered shrimp and snow crab with potatoes, rice and sausages. The shrimp I got the hot n juicy sauce with like the mild spicy - the taste was perfection!! I mean I was in heaven! The crab legs I got in garlic butter but somehow when it came out it was super spicy so to fix it an employee suggested adding butter first so he brought me butter and I poured it in the bag and to my surprise the spice level decreased. I will say the quality of the crab legs could've been better. They weren't as fresh as they could've been (I could tell by the shell) but overall they were still tasty. The service was great and overall I was very pleased with everything.",

Also I tried Cajun, garlic butter and paper and lemon seasoning.  Between all shrimp was great as always with medium spicy level comes with garlic butter. I always ask for a side of sauce just bc at first it hard to dip the meat in sauce in the bag. They charge for it but it all worthed . Also, don't forget to try the corn in the sauce . It is very well butters and seasoned. If you are so hungry go for bowl of rice. It is perfect match with any seafood and sauce. There is a waiting time on weekends and might be a little crowded.

I thought Kickin' Crab was the best until I tried Hot N Juicy.   My boyfriend and I were staying at the Flamingo and we didn't want to walk on the strip. Looked up nearby places to eat and decided to take a chance on Hot N Juicy. Best. Idea. Ever. We were seated quickly and got 3 pounds of shrimp with sausages. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was really good! The only item I would not recommend is the sausage. Maybe I'm just used to the hot link/smokey sausage at Kickin' Crab. The sausage here is very sweet and doesn't taste that good with the sauce. Still, I came back the very next day for lunch LOL. I already can't wait to come back!",

First things first, try and go during non peak hour times to avoid a wait for a table and having to walk a bit do to the limited parking.  Now it's all amazing from there.  Every time I have been here the staff and accommodations are amazing.  Today was nothing different. Our waitress was spot on in every aspect and I could not have asked for more.  The food was right out and we ordered a lot.  Four pounds of shrimp, a pound of mussels, two orders of nuggets, two orders of fries, corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausages; with a few different sauces to try. (Told you; birthday feast lol)  As with ever time prior the food is amazing, with more than enough flavor. The portions are beyond reasonable, and I have never left feeling hungry.    Being able to make a mess while ripping through this seafood overload and sharing the experience with your group is what this spot is all about.  Despite the limited parking and sometimes long wait this is a five star experience.  If you have never been, get a couple of people, venture down, and take the plunge into this pool of messy delight.  Thank you Hot and Juicy for being you over and over again.  See you next time.",

This type of seafood is not my favorite but i tried a half pound of shrimp with hot n juicy flavor and BABY SPICE level LOL. I cant take spicy at all and my friends gave me a lot of shit for getting baby spice so beware hahaha. But it was really good and i can definitely see the appeal of this restaurant. The only thing is that it felt really chaotic there which is understandable on a friday night. However our servers and food runners were really confused or something. Like 4 different people asked us about these 2 pounds of medium shrimp and we was like nah son we already got it!! They also overcharged us and we had to get that fixed. It was hectic in there. Also apparently theres this ongoing debate of hot n juicy vs boiling crab. I def need to try boiling crab so i can choose a team. I will come back an update zont worry. 3 stars because service was spotty and they didnt have corn fritters WHICH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING :(   I came here like 3 days ago... And i swear my fingers still smell LOL like i even wore gloves while eating??",

I settled on King Crab Legs, a pounds worth, done in the hot and juicy style with mild heat.   As I waited, I noticed a new item in the menu, fried pork rinds, so being raised on Canadian bacon, I selected it as an appetizer.   The rinds arrived still crackling like a bowl of Rice Krispies. Moments later my server dropped a bag of crab legs on my table.   I don't know what was better. The crab legs were the meatiest, sweetest and biggest I have ever enjoyed. But the sauce was a total win as well. I even went as far as to use the pork rinds like taco chips to eat the seasoning sauce.   My only regret was not ordering two pounds!  My many years eating in Vegas, and this was the best. Note to self:  rent a car so I can go for every meal next time I'm in town!",

It was my first time at this location because my family and I usually eat at the one down the street near Lee's Sandwiches and I'm happy to say that this place was waaaaayyy better. The one we always went to before always seemed to mess up or forget our order, evvveeryyyy time. This new find was right on.  I ordered a pound of shrimp in Lemon Pepper sauce, Baby Spice (because I'm a baby and can't handle spice lol) and we ended up getting an extra half a pound of shrimp for free (they were having a mardi gras special) which was a great surprise. The shrimp were large and juicy and just so yumyum good! We also ordered sweet potato fries and two cups of rice.  We also were given a Girls of Hot n Juicy calendar! Where certain Hot n Juicy female employees were dressed in classy cocktail dresses while holding different seafood. So creative and funny. Oh geez, I love it here lol =]",

It was pretty late so we were just looking for a small snack for a decent price.  I specifically ordered 2 pounds frozen crawfish which was priced for $7.99 a pound. It should have come out to ~$16.00 pre tax, but when I got the bill, it was $25.00+. I asked the waitress about our bill, and she said that they ran out of frozen crawfish. I asked her if they're supposed to let their customers know that they ran out of something, and she said yes. Confused as to why she didn't tell us? Every crawfish place I go to tells their customers if they have run out of something. Aside from that, the crawfish was actually pretty good and the sauce was tasty.  I also ordered the fried catfish which was supposed to be $7.99 but we were charged $10.99. When we ordered, she asked what kind of fries we wanted, implying that the fries were included. I even asked if it was included? She didn't say anything... Other than that, the catfish and fries were good too, they came out hot which was nice.  The food was good but I was disappointed at their service. Didn't catch the name of the waitress, but  it's irrelevant because I won't be back. She didn't try at all to do anything about the situation. I'm tired of dishonest employees...",

    "text": "I have a hard time deciding between which one is better between the two: Hot N Juicy Crawfish or the Boiling Crab. Yes, I know there are other establishments in town that involve eating seafood with your bare hands, but these are the only two I've been to so far, and that is where my judgment stands.   I never quite understood the hype of these kinds of joints when I heard all of my friends talking about it. After all, why would I PAY to do more work? I'm the type of person that just wants to eat. However, after eating here a few times, I can see what the hype is about. It's the experience.   It's fun, really. If you haven't tried it yet, those are the only words I can describe it. I'm not too good with my spices, but the butter garlic baby spice hit it right on the dot for me. SOO good.   My table order the King Crab, shrimp, crawfish, and oysters. The oysters they gave were all decent in size and I didn't feel like I was being ripped off with my money.   The legs of the crab were quite big, tasted juicy, but was definitely hard to open, even with the cracker.   I feel like the crawfish could be skipped just because they're so tiny. Not just for this place, but crawfish in general. Unless, you extremely love the taste of prawns, it's more work than what it's worth. But that's just me.   As for the shrimp, it was the big winner here.   My only big gripe is the table we were seated at. We were a group of 5 seated at a table meant strictly for 4 people, and it was definitely uncomfortable having such a tiny eating are to split between us. After all, we did order a lot of food. At times, it also felt like the servers were rushing us with the way they kept checking over us towards the later half. It didn't sit too well with some of my acquaintances.",

Their seasoning was definitely something different and unique compared to boiling crab. Their traditional sit down and eat is quite fun and funny as well. I believe our servers name was La? She got to us quickly after attending her other tables. She asked if we needed help with putting on bib LOL. (You use bibs to prevent yourself from staining your shirt since the seasoning are quite juicy). She recommended the hot n juicy flavor. My whole family loved it.  She also did recommend if you hate spices or are terrible with it, to start at their lowest spice level. Thank goodness for that advice because I was already sweating with the \"premature\" spice aka baby spice. She was super helpful with everything. I would love it if they opened one soon here in Chula Vista or near Temecula!!!",

We had to ask for utensils for our crab legs, gloves and for the bucket to put our shells in.   Additionally, we ordered one pound of crab legs each and received what appeared to be less than one pound based on our previous experiences at other establishments. When we inquired about this, we were informed that they don't actually measure the crab legs by the pound but they count the number of crab legs per order. This can be a bit misleading.   Despite its shortcomings, it is a cute restaurant. If I wasn't so spoiled by The Boil, I might have enjoyed my meal here today.",

Although I always seem to get a weird feeling in my head everytime I eat here, I always come back.  Flavor, flavor, flavor!! It's so strong and tasty!  I always get 1lb of shrimp, corn on the cob, half dozen sausage, and maybe a couple potatoe's all in one flavorful juicy bag. And a side order of rice... Or two.  Service is ALRIGHT, they're not on top of their game as opposed to the Boiling Crab in Alhambra, CA.  Beware!! After eating here, your hands, breath and clothes will smell like hot n juicy garlic for days!!  I suggest you ask for gloves and wear clothes you don't wanna wear out that night as it will begin to be smelling like your aunties house who cooks all the time. As for the breath, there's no escaping that.  Don't wear a white shirt either, guaranteed there's gonna be shrimp and crawfish brains splashing everywhere.  The bib they give you is essential.",

Went there with friends for the first time and being this our first meal of the day of the trip....YELPers and Hot n Juicy totally did not deliver...for shame for shame  Lets begin... the service - eh its ok, i had better at like a McDonald's but it wasnt like horrible but eh.... the decor - like again...nothing fancy, ive seen better McDonald's, but it was at least together...like there is a theme but it just isnt my cup of tea.  Onto the food - so their menu isnt BIG but its decent Price was a lil out there but then again...its seafood  I ordered fried calamaris...i know...but i still got something that is seafood and my friends got the shrimp and clawfish sha-bang. I tried a shrimp for myself, and ok the sauce was alright...nothing that i would die for if i dont have anymore but eh..im not going to miss it.  My fried calamaris...where are you, i was waiting!  I was expecting fries to come along with it since it said it would but...with a sad face...i didnt get it =(.  My calamaris? how are they you ask? umm...tasteless? is that too harsh, ok...it was very blah and not seasoned and the portion size...it is probably the size of my fists and then some.  Yea not much for 9 bucks...  so my friend's meal...NOT SO PRETTY....the crawfish was big but not fresh...it was black...and i know a thing about seafood or so...and it shouldnt have looked like the way it did....soooo  to just finish the whole thing...it wasnt good, it was a waste of my money and everyone else's....and never again... will i go back",

The scent of their cajun sauce will creep up on you for the next 24 hours and will stay on your fingers for a few days no matter how much you scrub it off. Quite frankly, though, why would you want to get rid of it?   I've never been to Boiling Crab so I have nothing to compare to, but the Hot n' Juicy sauce is out of this world. Garlicy, sweet, spicy, savory, and any other cajun-related flavor sensation imaginable is packed into it. Shrimp is the way to go to get the most value. Why would anyone want to pay for a pound of crawfish and end up eating only 1/4 of it?   Service is so-so. Since this location is smaller than its counterpart down the road, it can get pretty packed. Make a reservation ahead of time or prepare to wait at least 45 min for a large group like we did. Although the waitresses seem to be doing the best they can, they screwed up one of our orders and made it seem like they were doing us a favor by fixing it later. Not the greatest way to handle a situation...  I'm with Adam Richman 100% of the way when he said \"I could sit here eating some of the best crustaceans in the country all day.\"",

Some people like the flavoring at BC and others like it at this place or that. etc...   So back to Hot n Juicy. We came here when it just opened for lunch (we knew about the crowds during lunch and dinner), we sat immediately and I ordered crawfish and shrimp both with med hot and juicy special. And you know what... i liked it. The crawfish was cooked right (not over cooked which i've gotten at other establishments) and there were different sizes of crawfish. a few really large ones to. the shrimp was equally tasty. With a side of salt, pepper and lime juice... oh my. I have my routines.  I also ordered the corn, sausage and cajun fries. Got a couple of Coronas to wash it down with and I was happy.   Ok, I wasn't really hungry.... ;) jk.  Service was friendly and attentive as well as attractive. Dining area is a decent size and i can see it getting a little cramp'd when it's a full house. Has a local dive feel. Don't expect gourmet here.  Sorry to hear about other's bad experiences at this place, as it was a good one for my friends and I. I look forward to going back and right when it opens for lunch. :) If you've never been, give it a try. Enjoy! :)",

One warning: it is VERY messy!!! Make sure you don't have ANY cuts in your fingers before you start eating (They do have gloves, but it's just not as much fun using them!) - other than that, you can't really go wrong with ANYTHING on this menu!  We always get crawfish with the HotNJuicy Special- with NO spice... We do like spicy food in our family, but even the mild has a pretty strong kick that does dull the yummy-ness of the sauce! Make sure you get a bowl of rice and order some extra sausages to eat with that extra sauce!  NOT the best place for hungry kids- we were able to get our girls some french fries & soda, but they got pretty frustrated trying to peel their own shrimp/wait for us to peel shellfish for them... and the craqfish creeped them out! (lol) But they ended up getting hapy meals on the way back to the hotel!  So for the best experience, leave the kids at home and go expecting a wait that will be well worth it!",

She wanted to know the date of my visit and who my server was. I really don't remember at this point and to be honest I wouldn't want anyone to be fired because of it. It was very uncomfortable and worth mentioning to the staff just so they are vigilant of their customers water needs and heat tolerance but, again, it was so long ago. Hopefully no one gets seriously hurt and they use my review to train servers.   As I said in my response to the manager, I'm definitely not upset about what happened during my last visit and I would definitely go back over and over again. I would just be sure to keep the water coming because even if you love heat (as I do), it can get a little bit out of control if you dont have steady stream of refreshments to cool down.",

Being from Cali I might be bias but there is a bit more spice and kick in flavor in the whole Shabang sauce than Hot&Juicy special sauce.  But just a bit so the difference is tolerable. Everything else as far as the menu goes is the same.  The biggest difference though between the two is the service.  It's my second time here and I've excused my first experience. Slow waiter, you have to request for salt, pepper and lime, and bibs.  In Boiling Crab, all that is already a given and they tie the bib around your neck for you.  Me and my friend were seated right away but a group of 5 or more, expect atleast an hour wait. Overall with the exception of the service, food was great.",

We had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 lb of snow crab (lemon pepper - medium spice), 1lb of shrimp (lemon pepper - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  Also got beers and sweet potato fries.  The lemon peper was good on the crab but not so good on the shrimp.  Were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  Really wish we had gone hotter.  We also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  Geez, aren't we smart?!?  On a Thursday night, it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  Service was really fast, if not overly friendly.   It seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  Food was great, incredibly messy and I thought it was a little pricey.  Not sure if I would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  I feel like I lived a little.  I also feel like I should share this little nugget:  The next morning, my BF says \"WHAT IS THAT SMELL?\"  It was us.  We smelled like garlic for a good three days. haha",

We tried just about everything they had but favorite was the head on shrimp and the mussels. The crawfish were kind of undersized so I will stay away from that next time. We had the extra hot and it was perfect--not unbearably hot but it had a great flavor. The only warning I have about this place is that someone doesn't like seafood or the smell of seafood don't bring them with you. This is a must try place in Vegas at a very reasonable price.

We also got a couple lobsters at market price (I wasn't paying so I didn't see the bill).  The lobsters were good, better quality than the crawfish.

Despite the long...LONG delay in returning there's one thing about hot and juicy i will never forget since the first time my brother took me there. START WITH MILD!!! I still remember the flash genocide of thousands of my taste buds when i took that first bite.  Service was great. Our server started off by informing us that because it's near the end of the mud bug's cycle the average size of the crawfish were smaller then usual. This saved a lot of grief and looks of WTH?! when the bags came. A majority of us where fine with the shrimp.  All and all an excellent night filled with laughter being exchanged between friends, shrimp and crawfish shells all over the table and everyone's garlic breath in the air.  Unless Hot N Juicy finds a way to breed and farm crawfish to provide large mud bugs year long there's no way this place can improve on what it's already got going.  Additional note it's every entertaining seeing female diners wearing stylish 'going out' clothes and that plastic bib with large lobster squeezing a lemon trying to save them a dry cleaning bill.

I'm a huge fan of Boiling Crab so I was excited that this was the same concept- and with NO WAIT.  For all those BC fans out there, you know this is a big deal.  Spicy levels are higher than the norm and ever so slightly pricier.  No big deal.  Service is awesome- we happened to be one in like 2 years to find a sea creature in one of our bags that looked similar to a cockroach, gross!!  They took the bags away, called the managers and confirmed it's just a sea creature that sometimes doesn't get filtered out.  Phew!  They recooked another order and comped ALL the shrimp at our table.  All we paid for was an order of fries, rice, and coke. Totally awesome business in my eyes!  4 stars only because the coveted 5 stars belongs to BC.",

    "text": "==================================================  Updated again:   They were actually closed, this time, due to health violations in 2010...info from the Las Vegas Review Journal \"Restaurant Report\": <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lvrj.com%2Ftaste%2Frestaurant-report-105329198.html&s=493ffb842bfda6c237db4807722e0661c3e21eb736f544f41d37e9146995a682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lvrj.com/taste/restauran...</a>  Personally I could care less if a restaurant get's downgraded due to violations because they often are just a bunch of minor things but I am strict, personally, about seafood restaurants. I've eaten at B and C retaurants before...not often..but I have and it was no big deal. But yeah...actually being shut down? Nah. Not for me, because it's seafood. It's up to YOU to make that decision. Most of you may not care, but people like me would want to know if they're going to chow down on shrimp and crawdads.  You would be surprised how many seafood places get downgraded but I don't often read about closures. Anyways...if you want to still eat here I have an idea that may solve things. Watch the restaurant reports and go after the reinspections because they would have fixed all of the problems. I think that's the best one can do with these cases, if you want to eat there but you're still worried.  ==================================================  Original update:  I loved the food when I ate there but it's kinda ruined it for ME, because of an old news alert put on Channel 13 action news back in 2009. I just discovered this today as I was researching the art festival First Friday.  I was conflicted about  updating my rating, because it's such old news, but I knew I would have wanted to know anyways, if I were perusing Yelp, so that others could make an informed decision of their own.  I downgraded my rating to A-OK, which is 3 stars. It's not bad, it's not good. I'm more interested in being neutral about this place and letting you decide for yourself.  I had my bad experience in July. The owner addressed the problems in August, to my satisfaction. Then in November they got a C rating with the Health Department.  If you google the Vegas channel 13 news website for their segment called \"Dirty Dining\", you will find they had run an article on Hot N Juicy  Crawfish about many health district violations from about the time I wrote my reviews.    The News channel aquired the records of the health inspection which were archived as PUBLIC records. They publish them as a community service.   -----------  I think it's commendable he fixed the problems listed on the report. Just like he fixed the problems I experienced when I had a bad time there. I admit I'm a little freaked out these problems were there when I was eating there but oh well. I never got sick!  So the final verdict is this:  1) The food tasted great!  2) They've kept their A rating since the 1 time downgrade to C in Nov 2009 by the health department. That's GOOD! They're most likely safe to eat at and you'll have a wonderful time! It's never happened again, and I believe people and habits can change.  3) After reading their reviews, service still seems to be inconsistent, as the norm.  It's just my PERSONAL decision to not eat there any more because I can't get their past violations out of my head after reading the report, but that's just ME.  I'm on the lookout for a new place to try when I have cravings for messy seafood. Any suggestions?",

Everything is a little spicy so I always order mild.  The place can get packed at night and doesn't take reservations so try to get there early.

I've been back every week since the first time I went, and one week I went twice.  I'm not a crawfish fan.  Maybe that is why I was so hesitant.  Nonetheless, I wanted to be open minded and faced my fears.    There was a half an hour wait and I remember thinking- this better be worth my time!  The staff is pretty friendly and accomodating so it helped my nerves while awaiting for our table.  I didn't order the crawfish but I did order the Hot N Juicy medium shrimp special as well as some corn and cajun fries.  The sauce on the shrimp was spicy, buttery and garlicky goodness.  3 things I love the most.  The shrimp is placed in a big plastic bag so the shrimp soak in all the juices from the sauce, and they put the corn (on the cob) in the bag to sit in the sauce also.  OMG.  SOOO good!  Eventually tried to expand my horizons and get the crawfish, but I wasn't a fan.  That is only because they creep me out.  So I'm a bit bias.  BUT shrimp fans rejoice.",

This location had the Man vs. Food banner  so we knew we were in the right place.  We had to circle to get a parking spot.  It was 90 degrees outside, but comfy inside.  We were able to snag one of the last tables. The other tables had families with kids, couples, and friends. The wait staff was all young and friendly.  We ordered a pound of shrimp in garlic sauce and a pound in the hot n juicy special sauce, mild for both.  They were nice size shrimp.  The flavor of the sauce was great and the shrimp tasted fresh.  The tables were covered with plastic and they had plastic gloves for us.   A big roll of papertowels was on the table.  It was messy.  The shrimp comes tied up in a plastic bag.  The kids got chicken nuggets and fried shrimp with fries, which came in a little basket and they were okay.  We didn't like the etoufee with rice that we ordered.  The flavor wasn't what we were use to, but the texture and rice seemed normal.   My family doesn't like the shrimp heads, so lucky me, I got them all.  I didn't eat them all, but I ate quite a few.  I didn't feel well afterwards, maybe it was the shrimp heads.  Hubby and kids were fine.  I normally have a pretty iron stomach, so I would try it again.",

SO dirty and what really pissed me off was that I asked for medium and instead got the spiciest hottest juice ever.  When I asked if it was correct, she just shrugged her shoulders.  Wow.

I have heard they have another location now to ease the congestion of the crustacean mayhem.  The Hot n Juicy Special is the only way to go. I usually get the medium but be prepared to reach for those paper towels to wipe your running nose. It's spicy but not unbearable and the taste of the sauce is still recognized by your palette which I believe makes for a perfect balance.

    "text": "10 dollars for a pound of cooked shrimp or crawfish?  It's a good deal.  Get the combo flavor, it's their most popular and for a reason.  Lots of butter and herbs and spices.  Their food is spicy so order their mild which is actually medium.  The crawfish wasn't interesting after the first one. They look like aliens and you can see their prominent lungs after you take off the shell attached to the head. The tail meat is about the size of my thumb's nail.  Don't try breaking open the claw, it's hard to do and the meat is so insubstantial that it's simply not worth the time to get to it.   I don't recommend the crawfish unless you are patient and on a diet.  It would have helped if shell crackers were available for the crawfish.  The shrimp is much more interesting and worthwhile, you can really taste the lovely butter mix when you eat their little arms.  However, don't suck out the heads because the heads taste very bitter!  They don't devein the shrimp so expect to eat shrimp poop.    The whole eating process is amazingly messy (the name Hot N Juicy is appropriate) and expect to stay for about an hour at least to take off the shells of each small creature.  This is definitely not the place for a date unless you find butter and shrimp poop sexy.  Definitely order the corn, it absorbs the butter and spices beautifully.   This is a place to enjoy a messy but delicious meal. I recommend their shrimp.  Service was fast and friendly.",

The crawfishes are pretty decent size and the spices are good. Unlike other places I have had, when u tell them mild, it is mild. When you tell them medium, its medium and so forth. The catfish basket is so-so here. I have had better, I don't like the way it is breaded. The Dungeoness Crab is VERY GOOD. They tend to run out so if you are going there for dungeoness, you may want to call before hand. My boyfriend won a contest with 4 other people.... 20 LBS is 5 minutes! Hahahahahah!  I prefer boiling crab in oc & alhambra and everywhere (they are a chain/franchise) but this is as good as it is gonna get in vegas til they open one!",

Tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - blue crabs, Dungeness crab, snow crab , king crab - NONE at all - only when our server took our order.  This time, I called ahead and yes, they had crab available.    Pros -   No wait at 6:15 on a Friday night Beverages refilled promptly Servers were friendly Food was good  Cons -  Two of us ordered Dungeness crab; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  No fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \"sea sheller\" plastic gadgets.  How did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  One of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  When I asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  Come on, it's a SEAFOOD restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open crab legs?  She did manage to bring two more to our table.  Only the crawfish included corn & potatoes.  I can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  How hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  Petty money grab, IMO. And . . .  Sausage, corn and potatoes were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  They were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.  Marinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.  Seasoning description on menu could have had more information.  I have no idea what was in \"Juicy Cajun\" or \"Louisiana Style\" - White pepper?  Black pepper?  Red pepper?  Paprika?  No clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.  Parking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.    If you go - Call ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want Park on the street If you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools Tell your server to bring the corn and potatoes with your seafood.",

Everything is very casual, plastic table cloths and foam cups for example. We ordered a pound of crawfish each, one pound with the hot and juicy seasoning and one with the Lousiana, both medium heat. They weren't kidding when they said the heat is one higher than you expect! The Lousiana was much hotter then we thought! But so so juicy, I was licking my fingers clean despite the burning, lol. Yes, the crawfish doesn't have much meat in it, its more an experience then filling meal. We tried the ettoufe (I think it is spelled that way) as an appetizer and it made the perfect start to the meal and were were very happy with the choice.   To the people who complain about the crab not being up to par.. keep in mind the name of the restaurant! Its a wonderful experience all in all and I highly recommend the place, just be prepared to make an extreme mess and dress appropriately!",

The service was charming, and helpful, as the menu is a bit confusing as far as prices and options. The food was delicious! Probably one of the best raw oysters I've ever had! The spices used were out of this world! Just make sure to ask for mild if you can't handle spicy food.  The location was authentic, right on the edge of Las Vegas China town. Servers spoke English and were informative.   I really enjoyed my dining experience here and will be back when I have a craving for seafood.",

We went with the hot and juicy, Cajun, and garlic butter sauces all in mild and they were plenty spicy! It's fun to just talk and peel! It's a busy place and casual so don't expect 4 star service but the girls are nice and you can just flag someone down if you need a refill or reorder. We also ordered the calamari, sweet potato fried, rolls and rice. The side of rice is enough for 2 to share unless you just love rice haha. The fries and calamari were ok I don't think I'd get them again. They also have fresh oysters! I'm not a huge seafood person but I still had fun and plan to go back. Don't be snooty, tie on the apron, be patient and enjoy a lazy afternoon of conversation and crustaceans!",

There was a short wait when we went there, we ordered shrimp and crab, sweet potato fried and corn. Me and my husband demolished every bit of the 2 lb shrimp and 1 lb crab.

She also walked us through the menu.  The only complaint I have was when we asked us about mild spice vs. no spice for my daughter's crawdads order.  She said mild wasn't too spicy so we ordered it and it ended up not being very \"mild\" at all.  We ordered a new batch with no spice and she \"reminded\" us that the mild was kind of spicy, which was not what she actually said but who cares!  The food was pretty awesome and I didn't go there to argue so I pressed!  I also ordered the fried soft shell crab with cajun fries and it was very tasty.  The fries were pretty good!  Get ready to put your plastic bib on and dig in!  Overall, very good food and I would definitely check it out again.",

My husband and I ordered 1 pound of mussels, 1 pound of shrimp, 2 pieces of corn and 4 potatoes in the Hot and Juicy mild seasoning. The seasoning was perfect amount of spice so that you could still taste and enjoy the food. The shrimp was not very flavorful and a few were mushy in texture. The mussels were amazing.  The wait staff did a good job on making sure our soda/ tea was kept full and seeing if we wanted to order anything else.  The bad... GARLIC! I walked out being able to keep vampires away for at least the next 24 hours. I enjoy  garlic but this is a little over powering. I can't imagine if I would have ordered the lemon garlic spice.

    "text": "Came here on Sunday, right when it opened... so there's no wait! At the beginning, the service was good until I guess they got more people and then our service was basically nonexistent... The water refill game was not on point. We had a party of 7 and our server was the guy with the man bun (forgot his name).  The food: Crawfish isn't in season so frozen crawfish is all they had. Fresh crawfish is normally $11.99 and frozen was $7.99 (which isn't that cheap IMO since i've had frozen crawfish at other places for $5.99). Two pounds of crawfish gives you free potato and corn. My friend ordered 2 pounds and added 6 sausages for $3. The sausages were sliced pretty thinly but they were decent.   I opted out for clams, spicy and hot n juicy style. I underestimated the spicy because I underestimate spicy at a lot of places. This place threw a good kick and I'm satisfied with the level of spice. My friends ordered the mild and the baby spice and they complained that they weren't mild enough or baby spice enough. My 1 lb of clams was $10.99 (market price at the time). I also ordered the cajun fries and made sure they were spicy. He says that the cajun fries are spicy by default. I was content with the fries while my baby spice and mild friends complained that they were spicy. The fries also had a nice kick to it.   My friend got a half dozen of oysters ($9.99). They were small and did not taste very fresh. They weren't the woooorst oysters I've ever had but they were far from being the best.   Final notes: Gloves and bibs are provided. Ask for salt, pepper and lime for a good dipping sauce. The table is able to be split amongst 3 tabs and each tab can be split amongst different forms of payment.   Overall, I haven't tried the Boiling Crab in Vegas yet but I'm pretty content with the Hot N Juicy location in Vegas. The ones I've tried in California weren't the greatest.",

    "text": "I haven't been to hot and juicy for awhile and have had no issues with them in the past so when a my brother came to visit I figured I would order some crawfish since he was craving it. Much to my surprise I was very disappointed. In total I ordered about 6 lbs of crawfish and they were not good quality at all. Much of the crawfish seemed like they had been dead for awhile as the shell and texture was very mushy. I'm talking like they had been dead for a few of days. In addition, the shells of the crawfish were very discolored. Crawfish are suppose to have red shells and sometimes they get dark when you boil them but these shells were so dark they were almost black. Additionally, I feel like I was getting a little cheated. When i looked at the menu there's a distinction in pricing with regular crawfish and frozen crawfish. I believe regular crawfish is about $11.99 per lb. and frozen is about $9.99 per lb. I definitely got frozen crawfish and was still charged $11.99 per lb. The only reason why I gave this place two stars is because of its sauce. It's good and I give credit when it's due. If you really want crawfish I highly recommend the buffet at the orleans hotel and casino. They have some really big crawfish and it's about $20 for dinner but it's all you can eat and there's other food at the buffet like prime rib as well! I eat there from now on.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Hot N Juicy even though I'm allergic to shellfish (nothing Benadryl can't fix).  It's laid-back, service is great and the food is simple but fantastic.  It's always busy...packed with locals and tourists.  We go here a lot especially around lent.  If this location gets to crazy-busy, there's another one a few blocks away.  They have oysters, mussels, crab legs, lobster, blue crab, clams, shrimps, and of course, crawfish.  With the exception of the lobster, you order shellfish by the pound.  You can pick the seasoning you want: cajun, Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper and hot n juicy.  Pick your spice level: less than mild, mild, medium, spicy extra spicy.  Pick your sides and appetizers.  You get a bib and you could ask for a pair of gloves because it'll get messy...you don't want to ruin your manicure, do you?  I do away with gloves since I like to lick the juices off my fingers when I eat here.   I'm not a big fan of crawfish because you it's too much work and you get a teeny tiny bit of crawfish meat.  I always get less than mild garlic butter...either crab legs or lobster.  Hey, if I'm going to have an anaphylactic reaction, I might as well make it count.    Don't take your date here unless you've been together forever.  Or maybe you can test-drive your date to see if he/she's down to get dirty.  The garlic smell lingers...on your breath and hands no matter how many times you brush your teeth, gargle and wash your hands.  After a day, you should be good to go.",

I also ordered a fried catfish basket and when all the food was brought out that was missing. Waitress said it'll be out soon. 10mins later I see another waitress give that order to a table that had come in AFTER we did and the waitress still said it was coming. She comes back 15mins later and says it was given to another table by mistake.  Each time I asked her about it, she just seemed to ignore me.   Only good thing that came out of the meal with my mom was that they didn't charge for the fried catfish after having me wait 30+minutes. Basically, I didn't get it until we had finished our meal.",

    "text": "2 parts to the review..  First comes to the actual experience my group of 7 and I had. The second is how Noemy Avalos, the amazing manager took care of the matter.  We began on a positive note when our male server took our drink order and explained thoroughly about the process of ordering from the menu. He was very polite, patient, and knowledgeable. Once our drinks were delivered, we had a new server, Natali. After she took our orders, our experience quickly became negative, as our food orders were all mixed up and half the food came out much later than the rest. Natali was kind enough to take off 2 items off our bill that took over an hour to arrive. We were already in a rush to catch a show, and we decided to settle up as quickly as possible.   When Natali delivered the bill, there were items that were added that weren't ordered. We had to explain that these extra charges were in fact not ours. She brought a new bill out, without explaining the automatic 17%  gratuity that was added. Because of the amount of time spent waiting for food, we decided to settle using 1 visa card, and worried about splitting the charges within the group afterwards since we were out of time.  Due to the rush, we tipped an extra $50 on top of the automatic gratuity, which was NOT deserved. While signing the receipt at the cashier, Natali should of mentioned that tip was already included. We understand that we should've spent a bit more time reading over the bill, but with 8 people rushing to catch a show, we weren't fully able to analyze the receipt.   We let Noemy Avalos know of this matter, and she not only decided to give back the $50, but she offered to refund the entire tip $100+ back. Amazing manager, and a pleasure to talk with.  We will return, when we come back to Vegas for EDC 2014. :)",

Delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types.   While I usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. I have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, lemon pepper. The snow crab legs hot n juicy extra spicy. The lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. A few sides such as sweet potato fries, the sausage and corn on the cob.   Yes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and I don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). I highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5  -Arnold.",

Tried the shrimp and king crab. Both were very good, fresh, juicy, good seasoning.   The main difference I saw in this place and Boiling Crab was the space and the wait. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated on a Monday night. Also the interior is a bit small and cramped. That means when it is full its quite loud and you have people sort of packed in all around you. Add in the music and it can get pretty loud. Also, can be sort of weird to have a big crowd of waiting people watching you as you eat. On the other hand the service was incredibly friendly. They greeted us immediately upon entering and our server was very good. Give Emeli a raise!  Overall, not much of a difference between the two besides the space and noise level. Hot N' Juicy seems to have good quality seafood, good service, decent prices (perhaps a tad more than Boiling Crab). Really just depends on your preferred location and whether you mind the wait.",

On my trip to Las Vegas, I was brought here by a couple of friends and I was hooked after that time.  My traveling buddy and I shared a pound of the Hot n Juicy shrimp with sausage, corn, and rice.  It was more than enough for the two of us.  The mild sauce had a big kick to it so if you're not the spicy fan, I don't even recommend the mild!  The sausage was really good as it had a snap to it and the corn was infused with a buttery version of the Hot n Juicy sauce.  The staff was excellent as they were very good with beverage refills as each of us polished off at least two sodas.    Hot n Juicy kicks all of the North Shore shrimp trucks in the face and make them beg to call it \"daddy!\"  I wished I had the time to come back again.  Any place that has me craving their food after a couple of weeks deserve 5 stars.",

When I showed the waitress, she insisted on it being the fault of the way I disassembled the crab, which would've perhaps aided in yielding another 1/8 oz of crab meat if done correctly. Mind you, this was in addition to $100 worth of lobster, shrimp and appz, all of which were delicious.  I'm not a fatty, I just like to splurge when the situation arises. If the young lady serving us would've even offered to comp me a house salad for feeling just a tad dissatisfied, I would've tipped her $100 instead of the $30 I left instead, which even my date still considered generous. I wrote this on the receipt though I'm sure the girl was happy to receive a tip at all, regardless.  Cook it at home. You'll impress her more and save yourself the money and hassle of being underserved by a barage of young waitresses who could really care less about seeing you off happy.   LG",

I have been to Kickin' Crab in Southern California & also Vegas' own Boiling Crab, so the expectations were set pretty high for a restaurant of this nature. When we walked in all the tables were not bussed, and they sat there untouched until they did last call. My bf & I aren't messy eaters so we put all of our trash in one bag and a server came to our table and picked it up and moved it to another dirty table. The food came out all at different times, the first thing that came out was the extra seasoning we ordered with our crab & shrimp...and even that was cold. I love king crab and their king crab tasted fishy and very salty and was very small portioned compared to BC or KC. Same as the blue crab, one of which had an empty shell. The shrimp was too fishy for me, my bf said it was fresh but I didn't like the taste. The Cajun fries were the only thing we really liked out of the five things we ordered. Service was poor. Didn't live up to expectations and wasn't worth the money.",

I absolutely loved the Etouffee and craved it everyday that I was there.  After trying Hot N Juicy, it will be a ritual to go straight here from the Airport once we arrive.",

    "text": "I know a lot of people love this place so i'm trying to review based on what i've heard from others.  As i'm not a huge crawfish/shrimp eater. So removing my bias towards the food, i think the place is great.  You wanna go here if you wanna get down and DIRTY with your crawdaddy's!  You order the suckers by the pound, cooked to perfection with your prefered flavor and spice, crackem open and suck their soul juicy flavored soul out.  If your a shellfish eater this place is a blast to be get grub on cause the tables are just lined with plastic and all you really do is just get your food slapped on your table, open your bag and dig right in baby.  Theres no holdin back.  You'll have a pile of ravaged food 30 mins later and everones gonna think your pregnant with a little food baby in it's 3rd trimester.  Waitiers were always super friendly and it's just a fun rowdy environment.   Parking kinda sucks goin into the place but hey, you cant winem all right?  I give 4/5 cause while teh food is good i'd like to see better seating.  I'm a tall guy so i'm kinda picky with where i sit and everytime i've come here i just feel crammed.  OH well i can get over it though.  as yelp says \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"",

    "text": "FINALLY! I popped my Hot N Juicy cherry!   Found this place on Yelp, and ready many many a review. I decided this was the perfect place to take my southern husband for a surprise birthday dinner, and it turned out to be a BIG HIT!   I took Yelper advice and we arrived early on Friday night at about 6:15 pm and we were seated right away. This place is pretty no-frills with the table settings, decor and furnishings, but after eating our meal I now see why!   We took MORE Yelper advice started with 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of Crawfish with only the Hot N Juicy seasoning, nothing extra, a side order of sweet potato fries and a couple of frosty adult beverages. The food came out fairly quickly in plastic bags (Like I said, no frills!). Bib in place, we dug in and were very impressed with the flavor, freshness, and the fact that the seafood was cooked to perfection. Not overdone! After round one, we decided on more frosty beverages and another pound of shrimp and 1 lb of snow crab. The snow crab was awesome (except my small injury due to my own stupidity and the fact I was talking instead of paying attention to my crab cracking. BTW Hot N Juicy sauce in an open wound is no bueno)!   Our total bill came to about $70 before tip which I felt was fair for the amount of food we ate and the quality of the seafood. It was about the same price we would have paid for beers and AYCE Sushi at our fave place, and I was equally happy and full and buzzed :)-   Advice: *Arrive early to avoid a wait (we were there at around 6 and were seated immediately, when we left the wait was about 45 minutes), *Wear the bib, don't come dressed to the nine's *Come hungry *Leave your small kids at home because your hands and forearms will be covered with \"juice\" and I can't imagine trying to eat and care for an antsy little one  Will we be back? You bet! And next time with a crowd of friends who we know will LOVE this place!",

    "text": "This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious! We got a pound of crawfish (medium spicy) and a dungeness crab (hot n juicy style). Great seasoning, good quality seafood, fair market prices. Since it's so popular, there is usually a wait at the door- we waited about 30 min. The wait staff is helpful & informative, but it's hard to hear due to the noise level in there- the music is great, tho a little loud. The food arrives in good time, but the staff was a little slow in keeping up with the drinks considering how spicy it is ;)  One thing to beware of- the parking lot gets crowded & often people park on Frontier street- when I returned to my car, the window was smashed :( So, park in that neighborhood at your own risk!",

    "text": "Excuse me mam?  Did you say an hour wait?  (Thinking) \"WTF, are you serious.  This S%$T better be good\"  I gave this place a try 3 times already, and each time was horrible.  I really cant believe this place is highly rated.  I mean the best part was paying for the bill and leaving.  Service sucked, Food wasn't fresh, Shrimped looked like the shrimp from walmart (Frozen little kind), and having lived down south in Biloxi, MS the seasoning was whack!  It seemed like they just put more seasoning in the bag to hide the fact that the shrimp or crawfish taste like rubber.  Why do so many people flock to the so-called \"hole in the wall\".  I'll tell you why, its because they paid to be on TV.    \"Well they wouldn't be on TV if they weren't good\"   Listen up.....the Detroit Lions are on TV every football season.  That still doesn't mean they're good.  LOL  (I can say that I was born there)  Go down the road to Cajun Crawfish, there's no wait, service is not as slow, and the seasoning is more authentic (in my opinion).  If I have offended anyone with this post, go eat there and you'll understand.  If you like it.....more power to you.",

My first time eating at the restaurant was during the premiere of Hot n' Juicy's spot on the Travel Channel, Man v. Food and I have been a regular since.   Moving to Vegas I found it was hard to locate the locally owned, unique restaurants. If you are looking for a unique restaurant with great seafood (hard to find in a desert), then check out Hot n' Juicy.  I feel like family when I visit and the servers are incredibly helpful in suggestions on what to eat.  This restaurant has great service, awesome seafood (try the snow crab!!), and offers a one-of-a-kind, affordable experience hard to find in the Las Vegas area. The best part? Your seafood doesn't come out on a plate. How does it come out then? I'll guess you'll just have to go see for yourself. Let's just say it is a hands on experience.    A regular meal for me includes at least a pound of snow crabs and a dozen sausage. For those who are looking for a milder juice lemon pepper is the way to go!",

Got seated, ordered the usual craw fish, shrimp, and sweet potato fries but the thing that i really enjoyed was the deep fried catfish with fries, it was mm mmm good salty and crispy with fish meat in the middle. Towards the end of the gruesome shell tearing lies the shrimp and crawfish graveyard on the table. i poured some corona (in my mouth) for the sea critter homies, RIP delicious bunch :)",

You can't go wrong with the hot n juicy special seasoning because it is a combo of all of them. Me and the fiance always make sure to bring out of town guests who love seafood here...they always satisfy!   If you don't know, now you know where to get some fresh, delectable seafood with a little bit of fun mixed in.",

If you had Boiling Crab, the \"whole shebang\" is definitely better than the \"hot n juicy\" seasoning. The service sucks! Our server didn't even stop by to check on us if we needed anything so we had to get some random server's attention to get us something we needed. I asked for a sheller and was told that they don't have enough utensils so I'm going to have to wait until the other customer's done with it. Three other tables next to is were told the same thing. How about investing in some cheap plastic ones, especially that you're on a seafood business. Oh yeah... The crawfish tasted old. As far as pricing is concerned, it's cheaper than Boiling Crab, but you get what you paid for. I'd say... Boiling Crab is waaaaayyyy better--- hands down!",
