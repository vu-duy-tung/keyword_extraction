    "text": "So after running errands with my husband, I was craving pizza, but just not any pizza...Chicago style pizza!  The deep dish, gooey, sloppy pizza.  My husband remember seeing this place multiple time so we decided to call in a carry-out and hoped to be able to pick it up on our way home.  I was surprised to be told that it was going to take 45 minutes for a small 10\" pizza.  Regardless, I was craving so my husband and I went home and waited until time to go pick it up.  When we got there, (after waiting for 50 minutes), it wasn't ready.  We had to wait another 5 minutes...  Now it was heavy (for a small pizza), so I was excited to get home and sink my teeth into a deep gooey cheese, pepperoni and green pepper pizza.  Visual everything looked great and the first piece of pizza was great but as the pizza started to lose it's warmth, the pizza beard got harder.  So I am not sure if it was because we got it to go or if that's how Chicago style deep dish pizza are...I doubt it but I will continue my search my Chicago style pizza.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but it wasn't what I was expecting...perhaps next time, I will hopefully have a better review.",

We ordered stuffed pizza...sooooooo good! hint: it takes 40 min to make so waitress said to call ahead if you want it faster.  I will be back!  Still in my top three pizza joints for Vegas.",

    "text": "We've noticed this place and have been meaning to go in. I got a recommendation from a coworker who was a native Chicagoan so we had to check it out. It just took forever because whenever we're in this parking lot, we're heading into Naked Fish's. It took an extreme exercise in control for us not to head in even when our intention was to get some deep dish pizza.  With that being said, we went in, grabbed a seat, and ordered drinks, fried zucchini as an appetizer, and awaited our food. Decor was a splattering of Chicago sports teams and celebrities. Tables were spaced nicely so different parties didn't intrude upon one another's conversation. The fried zucchini was yummy. We saw other people being served before us who had arrived after, and after about 40 minutes, finally inquired with our waitress why that was. She explained deep dish took longer (we should have known, but it was our first time and would have been nice for her to ask and advise so we weren't getting frustrated).   In another couple of minutes, our pizza was out, and my, was it worth the wait. (Although, we'll probably call ahead to avoid the wait). We ordered it with pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno. All conversation dwindled to muffled groans and MMMMMs full of hot, melty goodness with crust that was to die for. We were embarrassed because after all the grumbling that happened, we were all silenced after one slice apiece. It made for pretty good leftovers.",

I hardly have any Chicago spots (where the hubs is from) I've decided to review a Chicago spot located here in Las Vegas! Ok, I'm cheesy, thanks.   We've been coming here since I moved here (5yrs). Love this place. The walls are PLASTERED with Chicago & some Vegas paraphernalia. Anything from Michael Jordan, Al Capone, the Rat Pack and Oscar Goodman! The first time we went here, we came in to watch a bears game, i think it was? lol My husband was wearing a Bears jersey and I was wearing my Chargers jersey (GO CHARGERS :) and of course I get the BOOS and he gets the Hi-Fives lol There is only one TV in the restaurant but most of the tables are within view of it and you can bet that it'll be a Chicago game on, if they're playing, except Sox games... ;) They're real friendly and service is top notch.   I'm not big on the sauce of the pizza but it's does the job when I want some pizza but what I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE are their Chicago Dogs! They have a special, you get 2 Chicago Dogs and fries for $5+! Tastes so scrumpdiddlyumptious!",

When I say Chicago style, it's prepared deeeeeep dish, takes at least 45 minutes to make, topings under the cheese on top. You can't handle it like normal pizzas and eat it with your hands. It requires fork and knives because it's so deep dish thick, the pizza is pretty heavy in both meanings  The crust taste is great and the toppings, well it does just that, tops it off to a great Chicago Style Pizza. Bada Bing Bada Bang!  Abosolute best Chicago Style in Vegas and suprisingly LA as well. Finally found a pizza joint outiside of Chicago that gives them justice.

The last time we ordered deep dish I was disappointed because it wasn't the same quality as in the past.  I made a mental note to check it out again on our next order which was this one. I was disappointed again. I feel like they are skimping on the sauce, seasonings, and grated cheese on the deep dish. I ate it anyway but called there the next day to voice my opinion only to be told that they have NOT changed anything. I asked to speak to the manager/owner who would not get on the phone with me. Instead I had the \"pleasure\" of two ladies on the phone telling me that if I would have brought the pizza back the previous night they \"might\" replace it but since I called the next day they can't do anything about it.  I didn't call for that reason - to get a replacement. I wanted to know if this was the way the pizzas are made now. I have been a regular customer for years and have always loved their deep dish but lately it wasn't what I expected. I was angry with their customer service and their attitude. I will think first before I order again.",

    "text": "Born and raised on Chicago pizza, these guys definitely get it right!! The crust was perfect, pepperoni was tasty and the sauce was terrific. There was just a little too much cheese and it could have used a little more sauce but was still terrific! They even brought a complimentary appetizer while we waited the 45 minutes (this is standard time for deep dish) for the pizza to be ready. I'll definitely be back when visiting Vegas. A little off the strip but oh so worth the 15 minute drive. The only complaint was the server (blonde), she was rude and visibly bothered when we would ask for stuff. Other staff seemed very friendly and pleasant. Hopefully next time we get one of them!",

    "text": "Being a Chicago pizza fan Amore was the first pizzeria I checked for Chicago pizza.  For me True Chicago Pizza is Giodrano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East. It is difficult to find True Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. Amore does a good job with their pizza though, especially if you can't travel all the way to Chicago!  The stuffed pizza is huge and heavy. The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14\" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14\" Amore pie.  Note if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.  The indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.  If you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now). Their pizza is big, has plenty of toppings and is very satisfying. It's the next best thing if you can't travel all the way to Chicago.",

Pizzas take about 35-40 minutes so we started with some apps  Had the chi-dog with some delicious Chi-town  giardiniera. A+  Calamari was lightly breaded and came out by itself with sauce(gravy). This was amazing and they way all the restaurants should serve it IMHO.   Pizza (here we go)  Deep dish sausage: good flavor, extra sauce (gravy) with a little extra crispy crust made this a decent pie.  Stuffed spinach: a gem, one of the top five pizzas I've had in Vegas; probably in the top three. Top notch  This place will become a staple in my Italian restaurant favs for sure",

The amount of fries they give you for $2.00 is not worth it. My friend had the cheese fries and the cheese kind of tasted like a cheese-wiz substance and they charge an extra dollar for that.   I don't know if they were understaffed but the service was adequate. Took awhile just to get our drink order taken. And over 20 min to get 4 sandwiches served to our table. And I did not hear the waitress ask us how our food was.   All in all the experience was alright. After reading the reviews for the deep dish pizza, I might give them another chance and go back to try that!",

I had the deep dish pizza and the fried dough with powdered sugar & honey. This is the best place on earth. That's all I can say. The Staff cater to you and the chef comes out to greet you and say hello. And they have a good view of Vegas just stand in the parking lot and bam you can see the entire Las Vegas strip. The place is SO clean I went to the restroom. And...people I don't EVER go to public restrooms. If every place in VEGAS was run this well their would be no bad reviews ever. I give this place 90,000  stars. And I will make the husband take me every chance I get.",

For those of you who like to be ignored and receive horrible service, this is definitely the place to go !! Ha. But on a serious note - we were seated right away, but then were not approached again until about five minutes later when someone finally took our drink order. Now, I may just have high standards,.. but it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to get 3 waters and 1 coke - especially in a restaurant where only about 3 or 4 other tables were occupied, and where there were at least 3 different servers. And once our food was given to us, we were not approached by anyone again.   Now, I'm on a mission to find the best Italian Beef and/or sausage in Vegas. Who doesn't love moist, tender beef and tasty, grilled sausage on good bread, with some Au jus? Apparently - Amore Taste of Chicago doesn't. Because the crap they served us was dry and tasteless. And the only flavor the Au jus had was salt.   This place does seem to have good reviews for their pizza, so I might give it a chance one day. But, I'll definitely be taking it as a To-Go order.",

The best thing about this place are the tomatoes and tomato sauce they use on the pizza and the bruschetta. It's PERFECT! Honestly I could eat the free bruschetta they give on its own and would be perfectly happy. The tomato are super fresh marinated simple. The cheese they use is super good too, extra gooey.  If this place existed back home I would definitely be a regular. FYI the stuffed pizza takes at least 45 minutes to make.",

On my second order a very helpful girl named Hailey helped me.  I gave the driver his own $10 and another $10 for Hailey.  I assumed she would receive the $10.  When I called to order again Hailey answered. I asked her if she got her $10. She thanked me yet told me she only got $3 as all tips have to be split.  On the new order I placed , this being my third order, I put another $10 in a Ziploc bag and wrote FOR HAILEY on it.  I waited an hour after my order arrived to call. Hailey answered and said that tip also had to go in the tip pool. I spoke with a 24 year old \"manager\" named Jennifer. I told her that was Hailey's tip and how upset I was. I was technically robbed of $20 and so was Hailey.  She said all tips have to be split and sounded like she has zero guest service experience or skills. I  told her this tip was to replace the tip that was meant sell for Hailey and she stuck with her inexperienced, naive, rookie answer. The drivers don't split tips so why would the phone girl. Staff stealing from staff and guests is UNACCEPTABLE!!  I WILL NEVER order again and am going to spread the word at the bar I work at and in as many social media sites as I can.  I am going to physically go there and hand Hailey her tips that were stolen!!! SHAME on everyone involved!!!",

On my third day straight of pasta for dinner figured perfect opportunity check out Amore Taste of Chicago. I know the deep dish pizza is the one dish that gets rave reviews. I was in more of pasta mood. I do intend come back try the deep dish.  Talk about from the minute walk in the place screams Chicago. I have had the pleasure visiting Chicago years ago for friends wedding. Some of the famous landmarks or touristy spots in the city been there done that in life. All around the restaurant every wall is collage of those iconic landmarks more so sports as main focus. Wrigley Field. The Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Cubs. I can appreciate any business more less restaurant that gives shout out too NHL or ice hockey. If your Cubs or Blackhawks this IS the spot check out games. Just happens the Cubs in the post season. I came for dinner one night they were playing and couple tables full on Cubs fan in jerseys. All full engaged in the game. They have three wide screens decent size around the restaurant so NO way not going miss Cubs or Blackhawk game. One more note about shout out for hockey. They have team picture of the Blackhawks with Lord Stanley Cup on the wall.   I started with house salad. Talk about decent size salad. It was on big oval plate not small bowl or tiny plate. I went with the house italian dressing. Everything together was refreshing and great starter dish. Pasta keep it simple Penne with meat sauce. The Penne was cooked perfect nice al dente. The sauce was ok. It was nice hearty lots of ground meat in it. The tomato sauce tasted fresh with nice body to it. Overall nothing that blew me away taste. Definitely dish would order again. The portion size they give you is huge. Price is very reasonable across the menu. I need try the deep dish pizza next visit.   The service was solid. My waitress was friendly, on top of things, and did great job.",

    "text": "The worst part of moving away from Chicago is that you can never find comparable food. This place has certainly addressed this issue, and in turn  improved Nevada's livability by 25%. So far, I've tried their stuffed shells, hot dogs, Italian beef, and cheese fries. I would recommend all of these to any homesick Chicagoan, as well as anyone here on vacation. My only tiny complaint is that the cheese on their cheese fries is just shredded cheddar, rather than the orange artery obstructing liquid us portly Chicagoans are used to. I still need to try their pizza, but based on the rest of their menu, I know it won't disappoint. I had even scouted this place before moving here, and was lucky enough to move close by. I've had carry out, delivery, and dine in meals here, all with prompt and friendly service from their staff.",

Be prepared to wait if you want to order a deep dish. The wait time for a deep dish is at least 45 minutes. I've always preferred deep dish but after having Amore's thin crust I've converted over to thin crust.   Their thin crust pizza stays crispy and is the best I've had. After trying their pizza, other pizzas just doesn't come close. Whenever my boyfriend and I have pizza at other places we always take a bite and say \" It's no Amore...\"   The service has always been really great here. One time our pizza came with a missing slice. My boyfriend and I just looked puzzled because we were missing a piece. The waitress informed us that they accidentally dropped a slice on the floor and will give us a little discount for the missing piece. When the check came they actually waived off the ENTIRE pizza. How sweet is that?  I've only had their deep dish twice and both times we had about half pizza left because its just so filling we could never finish it all. Still tasted good hours later when it was cold.  Parking is never a problem here. It's actually in a pretty dead plaza or at least every time I'm here there's almost no cars.   Tried their spaghetti once and regretted it. It just seemed really plain. Their fried mozzarella are really good though.   Credit cards accepted!",

Next time we visit ATC I will try the deep dish though...who knows, they may change my mind.   The ordering and pick up went pretty smoothly. I do want to note, if you select CC or Cash, be sure to stick with your payment option. I guess I had selected cash so they would not accept my CC as a form of payment. I had to run over to the store to get cash back in order to pay ATC for my pizza. Kind of a hassle, but they explained that the order did not go through them and that they were unable to change the payment method. In hindsight, I'm now thinking that's pretty strange though.   So! To the pizza! The pizza was pretty good! Not the best pizza, but I will return to ATC. The thin crust still had a little softness to it (which I like). Some pizza joints can really crisp up their crust, so glad that I found a place that doesn't. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but not unbearably so. The amount of cheese they used was perfect... but having ordered double pepperoni, I noticed that it appeared like a \"regular\" amount of pepperoni. Not sure if that was a fluke or that is the norm.   We had also ordered a cheesy garlic bread starter. The garlic bread was pretty good, nothing extravagant. I do wish that they hadn't wrapped them on top of each other, the cheese kind of stuck everything together. It was more so like a cheesy garlic sandwich by the time we got home.   All in all, my experience having A Taste of Chicago's pizza was \"A-OK.\" If you've never had it, try it! It's definitely worth the try.",

The staff was super nice and didn't make a fuss. They just came over and wiped up the floor like it was no big deal. Also. Thank you nice lady behind me for not minding either. It was rancid. And everyone was so nice about it.  So we get seated and ordered another Caesar salad at the table. The salad comes out and in no time at all the pizzas come out (nice tip huh!)  The salad was great. The pizzas were great. And the staff was great. They kept coming by to ask for refills.",

I completely dismissed that, however about an hour after I placed my order. I call and they say they tried to call me and they knocked on every door on my block. No one knocked on my door.  Turns out the lady put in the wrong address and put in the wrong number by one digit. They ended up sending the delivery man back and he was super apologetic and very nice about everything. He said he knocked on every door but mine? I got spaghetti and meatballs that had no flavor whatsoever and the sauce was simply placed on top. I also ordered an Italian beef sandwich with mozzarella.  The sandwich was stale and the mozzarella was no longer melted. The two stars are for the nice delivery man. That is all.. very disappointing",

It's hard to know what your going to get when your going to a restaurant that'claiming it can recreate a taste and memories from your past.

You will never find as good as  Lou Malnati's here but this place isn't even close.  Sorry Amore's but you lost our business after 10 years.  Ever since the head chef Enzo left and all the the staff changes including our favorite waitress Rosemarie not there anymore, the food went down hill too.  We went to Rosati's on Hulapai by Town Center and Wow it tasted just like Giordiano's.  Once you have their pizza you will never go back to Amore's.  Its very delicious, taste just like back home again.",

I will never go there again, though. We ordered delivery and got bacon and cheese fries, chicken fingers, a chicken sandwich and a house salad. Nothing was good. How do screw up bacon and cheese fries? Everything just seemed stale and tasted off. And the point of no return for me was finding a chunk of styrofoam cup IN MY SALAD. We didn't order any drinks and there were no damaged containers in our order. So basically, there was trash in my salad. It wasn't even on top. It was mixed in and I didn't even notice it until I was about a quarter way through. I don't even understand how this could happen.  I won't be able to bring myself to eat here again.

    "text": "Was in the mood for a deep dish pizza and began the Yelping and stumbled upon this lovely place outside of the strip. Which is nice because you get to enjoy a local spot without the chaos of traffic or tourists. Came here EDC weekend, and was starving! My bf never had a Chicago pizza and does not understand how massive a Chicago pizza is (my vote goes to Lou Manalti's all you Chicagian's)  besides that we decided to give it a try.   We did the personal pizza, and customized it with cheeses, spinach and chicken. We also got a order of garlic bread to start with! That was kind of a mistake because yes, you are waiting awhile because Chicago deep dish pizza takes 45m+ to make and bake so pls be patient. But also I would highly recommend getting something lighter like a salad to start with since the pizza is very cheesy and heavy.   After trying this pizza, it was alright. I was looking for more flavor and I did get that. I actually had to add cheese and red pepper flakes to give it that extra flavor. It was very cheesy and saucy (if your down for that) and this pizza it was a deep dish style without the layers. It does the job, we both were very full, and could not eat a bite after & we took some home as well. *beware of portion size, it's huge* 2 my bf and I could not finish the small. I would recommend this place to people looking for a local spot off the strip and in the mood for something different.",

    "text": "Looking for a new place to try we stumbled across this crazy good restaurant. We had originally planned to try another restaurant in the same mall but the other place was empty where as this place was getting busy. I really don't know how I have overlooked this place but glad we came upon it.  It is not fancy, simple tables with comfortable red chairs for seating. It is kinda like cafeteria style seating but the food servers do take your order from the table. By the time we left, the whole place was almost full.   They specialize in deep dish Chicago style pizza of course but we were in the mood for an entree. I ordered the Gnocchi and my friend had the Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta. We shared a salad with creamy garlic dressing and some garlic cheese bread. One of the standouts for me was the complimentary bruschetta. It is homemade and made fresh everyday. It was so delicious, most likely the best I have ever had. We had a little side on our salad. My friends Chicken Marsala was so tasty. I only had a small bite but the sauce was made just right, not too sweet and the chicken was tender. I enjoyed the Gnocchi but have had better. The creamy garlic dressing on the salad was delectable! We had no alcoholic beverages but they do offer a small menu of both beer and wine.   The service was really great and I could tell there were plenty of regulars in the house cutting up and chatting up the servers. I can't wait to go back and delve into the deep dish pizza. I plan to take our good friends from Chicago.  Good food, good service, good value!",

We love to eat here so we had an idea what we wanted to have served, however, the staff suggested to have the food \"double cut\" so that the very large pieces would be small enough for our guests to try everything.  It was perfect!  We had salad, pizza, pasta, chicken and some appetizers. Our guests were really happy to try so many of the menu choices and loved the food. They all left really full and we had a small amount to bring home. The service was terrific from the time we talked to the waitress about having our party & until we left that night. We highly recommend this restaurant for a large party or small dinner.",

Maybe because it was late night (two hours before closing time) but my Italian Beef was pure trash! I've came here before and had an ok experience and I decided for a second time and was soooo disappointed I wanted to cry. My bread was hard as a rock !  I mean so hard I could not bite into the sandwich I had to pick from the inside where the bread is soft at. There was one SMALL layer of greasy non flavored meat smoothed in a undesirable amount of cheese and I counted THREE hot peppers. I also ordered fries and did not receive any! I was so disappointed. My meat was sooo greasy and no it was not the gravy because I asked for the gravy on the side. It was so greasy it made the insides of the bun sooo soft it fell through the bottom. Idk maybe this restaurant needs a trip to Chicago or maybe even Portillo's (locations in Cali) to know what real Chicago Italian beef is ! $12 wasted !!",

    "text": "From the outside it looked like a hole in the wall... but the inside was nice! Tons of comfortable seats, lots of posters/pictures on the walls and some TVs. Service was great and it wasn't very crowded when we went around 2 PM on a Sunday.   We ordered the garlic cheesy bread which came with a side of marinara. I wish the garlic cheesy bread was more garlicky but everyone has their own preferences. My sister and her bf thought it was fine. Good thing we ordered the bread because the pizza did take about 30-40 minutes.   We ordered a medium deep dish pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and pineapple. When the pizza came out, we didn't see any pineapple and asked about it.... we didn't realize that for deep dish, they put some toppings (like our pineapple) underneath the cheese. Oops. The pizza was good, but the crust was very very hard. I've never had a deep dish pizza before, but I was expecting a soft crust. Also, the crust was a bit on the sweet side. I'm not sure if its because the pineapple was sweet and it seeped into the crust or what but I wasn't a big fan of the crust. There was a ton of cheese, and the pineapple was a very good addition to the pizza.   Our total for 3 people came out to be around $26 before tip which wasn't bad at all considering we had about half the pizza left. I think an appetizer, a salad and a medium pizza would be more than enough for 3 people.",

Also have tried a variety of the food offered, and everything is worth it, from the pizza to the wings to the chicken parm to the cannoli.   The best thing about this place is you don't have to sit in the restaurant waiting 45 min for the deep dish to cook. (Yes, it takes that long!) You can call ahead and have the pizza waiting when you show up to dine in.",

Being deprived in Hawaii (Note: Chi-Town Deep Dish Pizza Co in Hawaii isn't even close to this)and not plan on visiting Chicago in the near future. We set out our journey to find ATC. The drive was not bad from downtown and willing to do anything or drive anywhere I didn't care...Arriving to ATC I was very very excited!  Finally my wait is over!..Walking in...  I just LOVED the interior of this place,with all the pictures of Chicago Sports Greats and Celebrities that filled the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwalls.It&s=d9985fed07e4b58ab1fd64d27c9dfd65a40729a72adc785545a949acdb8fab69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">walls.It</a> just puts you in the mood for whats to come next.. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#L6-nCU2crqXwISzmLaB0WQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG...</a>  We order: *Reg house salad which includes fresh mozzarella cheese.

Funny how digging into a pizza with a fork and knife never felt so right. The first thing that hits you is the great the flavor of the fresh tomatoes bursting when it hits your palate,spiciness of the sausage and pepperoni,Oh My God How Buttery The Crust Is...OMG! I just had a Foodgasm!  Our friend who had just returned from Chicago the previously week also was enjoying the pizza with us remarked it was like being in Chicago again!  Our server Rosemary was so friendly and helpful with all my questions I asked.  Rosemary: Where are you all from? Me: Hawaii ! Rosemary: From Hawaii? *With a surprised look* How did you find us? Me: Yelp!  ATC has some great reviews and I had to try great deep dish pizza!  (Thank You all my LV Yelp friends!)  Just some helpful information:  *The normal wait for a Deep Dish is 45minutes *You can call ahead for seating and pre-order your pie.

As a Chicago born-and-bred gal now living in California, I was craving Chicago pizza and Amore had been recommended by a high school classmate.  It did not disappoint!  I ordered a small deep dish pizza (worth the wait) and my husband (not a pizza lover) decided to try a thin crust with roasted peppers and sausage.  We both devoured our own pizzas!  Yes, they were that good.  The bruschetta appetizer was excellent - good and garlicky.  The wait staff was phenomenal.  There's no \"my table-your table\" - they all help out.  Service was fast, efficient and friendly.  It felt like we were at a friend's house.  I loved the Chicago decor and it was a bonus that the Cubs were on TV and won.  Oh, yes, and two beers and one glass of wine brought our total bill to $40!!!  Check this place out if you love pizza.  We didn't try any of the Italian dishes, but judging from the comments and orders of people around us, these are tremendously popular as well.  Looking forward to another visit soon!",

The restaurant doesnt have much atmosphere, i'd recommend getting your pie to go (especially if you dont want to wait the 45 mins it takes to bake).  They have a large menu with pasta choices, apps, and some salads.  House salad was decent, the creamy garlic dressing was super good.  Their pizza crust is mediocre and a bit too crispy.  The sauce is slightly sweet and not flavorful enough.  The spinach on my pizza was the frozen kind and extremely watery, which threw off the entire thing.  I would recommend getting a cheese pizza here when you are craving deep dish, since there arent many options in this area.  It isnt bad, it's just not the best deep dish of my life.",

To give you a judging point, in Chicago my favorite pizza was Giordano's stuffed and Amore is the closest thing to it.  I have eaten their thin crust and stuffed and both very good. In addition, I used to love Portillo's italian beef in chicago. While Amore's is not Portillos, it is very good and definitely the closest thing in Vegas to Chicago italian beef.

Had I eaten at the restaurant I would have sent most of my food back. I ordered the sausage sub, with 'spicy' peppers, French Fries, and (to fill out the delivery minimum) the fried dough.   The sandwich was the least offensive although the spicy peppers were actually a mixture of peppers, carrots, and cauliflower. Not terrible but not exactly what I was expecting.  I will give the French fries the benefit of the doubt since they were delivered but they were soggy and tasteless.   The absolute worst part of this order was the fried dough. Described as, what else given the name, fried dough with powder sugar and honey. I was expecting something like Greek loukamedes. HA! It was barely cooked spare pizza dough that appeared to have been fried in the same as oil as the French fries. Of the two I managed to choke down, the inside contained oil that definetly was not fresh. No powdered sugar on these...things...and what they were trying to pass for honey was brown, greasy, sugar water.  Be warned before eating here.",

For the first time, I was disappointed. The sandwich was served open faced, and no fries. I'm not picky about most things but that sandwich was not on par with what we've ordered in the past. I should've just ordered the angel hair past in meat sauce. WAY better.",

I was surprised by the lack of Bears fans considering its a Chicago bar, but then again, Cutler wasn't playing (but then again...so what?).   Our waitress, Tiffany, was fabulously efficient. We got our water with lemons, put in an order for the sampler and white pizza, and were informed that they don't serve alcohol but we could get drinks next door from PTs and bring them in. DONE AND DONE! Sidenote: $3 Bloody Marys for Sunday Funday.   Sampler consisted of fried mozzarella, fried ravioli, fried zucchini and mushrooms! We obviously weren't watching our figures. White pizza was delicious! The medium was more than enough for the boo and I. Requested to have the audio turned up and request was granted. \"Only for Bears' games\", Tiffany exclaimed.  Will definitely be returning to get a slice of home!",

The driver showed up after an hour and a half and was out of breath due to being out of shape. He looked like he didn't want to be here and was giving a ton of excuses on why he was late. I thought oh well maybe the food will make up for it. Nope! It arrived cold and messy. It was soggy and bland not to mention the appetizer sampler was gross and everything tasted the same even though it was suppose to be a variety. I couldn't even finish it I was so disgusted. Clearly, there was no effort putting together this meal. Thumbs down. Go to the grocery store and buy your own to put in the oven and it will be 10 times better than this mess. I had to update my review.  I have been sick since I ate this food and I threw most of it out. I spent over $40 for disgusting food I couldn't eat and made numerous trips to the bathroom! Proceed with caution!",

We have been regular delivery customers and casual diners here for years! We called in our order, since every Chicago native knows, stuffed pizza takes a minimum 45 minutes to cook  ;)   We dechlorinated ourselves and changed into clothes. We got there a little early and secured our picnic table outside facing the strip for the fireworks show that was due to start 5 minutes after our pizza was due to be served. We didn't pre-plan this because wehad decided to just wing it and see what everyone had a taste for when we all got hungry, but it couldn't have all fallen into place any better!! The place was busy but we were immediately greeted with smiles upon entering and the girls at the counter were super sweet. We gave our name and were informed it would be 15 more minutes. Perfect timing for fireworks. The pizza was out right on time. The girls knew we were dining out front so they made sure to stock us up with plates, plastic ware, paper towels, crushed red pepper and Parmesan. They were getting ready to close by then and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. Very hospitable! The food was fabulous as usual! Thank you so much Amore for making our unplanned 4th of July dinner such an easy phenomenal experience!!",

The white pizza{we added sausage} was good a little greasy but it was decent. Ordered the 2.Gyro no grilled onions and no tomatoes but I ordered raw onions.  3. Sampler appetizer {will never order that again} 4. Chicken parmesan  {The noodle and sauce was in separate container}. The pizza and Gyro we knew we was going to order it again and we did on Tuesday. The Pizza the same but this time I took a napkin and dabble some of the oil off it. We ordered the caprese salad will not order that again.The Gyro I ordered it the same as the 1st time. I did Not get any raw onions. So I called and the Manager said she can give me a credit of a $1.. WTF!!! OR I could bring the Gyro up there and they can fix it. I told her we just paid a delivery charge and tipped the driver what part of I CAN NOT DRIVE and WE DO DELIVERY ALL THE TIME did she not hear. She said that is the only option I had. I reminded her that I waited tables for 30 yrs on the east coast{My Career} I know customer service and common courtesy. Common sense we ordered on Saturday and we are ordering again on Tuesday{REPEAT CUSTOMERS} The Mgr was arguing with me over the phone how lame is that? I even said to her that they can come get it because I can not eat it without the raw onions. I even paid extra for the taziki and on the pizza add sausage. You are arguing to not give me a credit of $6.95 because YOU screwed up. The Chicken parmesan, Sampler appetizer  and the Caprese salad NASTY but that did not stop us from ordering the Pizza, Gyro. Treat people like you want to be treated. We will NOT be a Repeat customer.",

When I got to the part, after the system told me the total cost, where the order system indicated that the pizza  would be ready at 6:21pm.  I assumed my pizza was ordered. I arrived at 6:19 and was politely told that there wasn't an order for me. I asked to speak to a manager, who happened to be standing next to the cashier, to whom I was talking.  After talking for a few minutes, she said to me, in a very condescending tone, where is your confirmation email.  I replied, that I never got an email, to which she replied every one knows that you get a confirming email, when you order online.  I responded, the system never indicated that a confirming email would be sent. After checking at home, I decided to re-order the pizza and wait 45 minutes for it.  I ordered the pizza from the same girl I queried about my original order.  I'm positive, I ordered a medium sausage and onion well done stuffed pizza, which is the only pizza we ever get there, what I got was a normal cooked cheese pizza with a few onions in it.  I had two pieces last night and found 4 small pieces of onion in the 2 pieces. I called back to the store and asked for the manager.  In the same condescending voice, she said that she was standing right next to the cashier, who repeated back my order and I never ordered sausage.  I never heard the cashier repeat back my order.  She the manager, did offer to redo the order, if I wanted to come back to get it.  I countered, that I would rather have a credit that I could use later this week, since I already was there twice, within the last hour.  She replied, that was not possible.  Not understanding what difference it made if I came back out that night or later this week to get my pizza, I asked for the owner to call me back. I never received the call! Needless to say Amore is no longer on my list of places for pizza.  I can still go to Giordanl's in Boca Park or if I'm over in Henderson Windy City Beef and Pizza on Eastern.  Both these location make a great stuffed pizza Chicago style.",

It would have been a lot better had the crust been seasoned, at least give a choice of seasoned and plain crust. For a deep dish pizza with so much crust (and I love pizza crust), the crust really need a touch of seasoning. Also, the large deep dish pizza that I ordered was overbaked, the top edges were black and made the crust really hard and inedible. Baking time should have been cut by a minute or two or have been covered by foil. So my first experience with deep dish pizza was not so good, need to find a better pizzeria",

At last it was time for the piece de resistance: a medium Chicago Deep Dish Pizza with tangy Pepperoni, small Mushrooms, and Sausage.  This was a True Pizza Pie: cheesy, saucy, and doughy in the Chicago style.  At dinner's end I was overcharged 50 cents too much on a cup of soup with any pizza order.  When I raised the issue, our waitress blithely told me that the price had been raised from $1.00 to $1.50, and I must have been given an old menu.  She pointed out that the menu I received reads, \"Price is subject to change without notice.\"  A nice convenient out!  But I chose not to quibble over 50 cents.

But .... there is a real difference! This is Chicago Deep Dish.... Dough, Cheese, then the Sauce! I opted for some spinach with my cheese.  I love the ambiance, a real Chicago decor. Cubs Photos and Bulls Photos everywhere. Perfect for Pizza! Wine was served in a water glass (I really didn't care!)  Deep Dish takes 45 minutes (I really didn't care!) This was really  some of the best deep dish pizza I have had in Las Vegas.",

Service was above average. It wasn't super busy when we went in the second time (been here twice) so they were pretty attentive. The first time we came in it was super busy and we did have a hard time finding our server. So quality of service may just depend on how busy they are.  As for food pizzas are thin crusted type pizza just cut into however. It's pretty average pizza, not bad but not stand out omg you have to have it. They only have 3 styles of wings (hot,mild and plain).  I would definitely recommend this place if you love chicago!",

    "text": "Sorry, I just bought my second pizza from you. You forgot the sausage. When I called, I was placed on hold for five minutes so I hung up.  I called back fifteen minutes later. I politely asked for a manager. I was asked the reason. I asked again. I was placed on hold over five minutes. A employee identified herself as a manager. She interrupted me, said they were under staffed and busy. I hung up due to her rudeness.  I drove over, asked for a manager. She identified herself while looking down at paper work not giving a s about a customer. I wasn't upset, I really just don't care.  I explained how the pizza was soggy and stuck in the middle and missing sausage. She peeled a slice and pointed, said there's your sausage. I was quiet. I was just shocked at her explanation.  I paused...said, you know, I've never returned a pizza but I'd like a refund. She giggled. Said she wasn't sure. Then after a staring contest she refunded me less than I paid by $2. She ignored explaining I guess it was for the slice I ate.  I asked why she was laughing. She said it was funny.  So.....I couldn't find a way to drop the three star to a ZERO but I hope one day this employee begins to show respect to people....just anyone.  She was so rude, I didn't even feel upset before or afterwards. I just felt sad for her as my sons who are her age don't act like her.  I'm a retired senior citizen, a veteran and bought a house here last summer.  I'll never be back. I dine out half the week.  Since my review, I've received two private messages that this poor customer service has gone on for years. Interesting to hear that.",

The only reason this review is four stars and not five is that occasionally the service slips. The servers tend to gather at a front table near the door and talk amongst themselves, which sometimes makes it difficult to get a refill on a beverage or get the check when you're ready to leave.   It's not something that happens every time, and the servers are never less than friendly and helpful.",

No surprise, I am from Chicago.  This is great Chicago pizza - whether it be the pan, stuffed or thin.  Real ingredients (no fake cheese here).  The owner is originally from a suburb of Chi-town and takes his pizza seriously, as he should!  Have also had the salads and not too bad either!  The sausage & peppers has a great taste but not sure its enough for a meal - perhaps a side dish.  If you're from Chicago, the options for pizza you'll enjoy are limited in LV, so you'll love this place.  (Love the memorabilia, too.)  If you're wanting to try Chicago pizza, give it a try - its a True representation.    BTW, this is the year for the Cubbies!! (had to throw that in, since writing about Chicago and its cuisine - just seemed fitting)",

Since this is a place with a Chicago flare, I tried the sausage, pepper, combo pie. Keep in mind that good things take time, wait is about 35-45 mins. While the wait is long, use this time to check out the big pizza oven in the back, the oven is as big as a small room!  As I mentioned, I ordered special pie, everything about it was nicely done! The crust was not doughy, but rather almost crisp and had a nice buttery flavor. The sauce was not too sweet, but had just enough acid to it. The cheese was standard, but what set everything apart was the homemade sausages that topped the pie! Right amount of spices, fat, and seasonings! Very nice!   Next time I'm going to have to try some of the pasta dishes they have. Looked pretty good coming out from the kitchen!   Sante",

We didn't cause a scene but pointed it out to another waitress, who completely agreed it wasn't our hair and apologized.  We asked if we could have the pizza as dine in. Which we got.  But when we got our check.. I was surprised that we didn't get even a penny off of the ribs..we were charged full price.. No coupon for a future discount...nothing but a \"sorry about that\".

It was deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage. I liked the pizza alot. Kinda a far drive from the strip but i wanted a deep dish pizza. So i looked on yelp and this place came up. many places do new york style pizza. I wanted deep dish. Pizza was great. I keep it on ice and it was still good when i warmed it back up at home after my little vacation. But customer service or i should say the cashier answering the phone needs an attitude adjustment. Maybe she had a bad day or didn't want to work Saturday but there is no reason to have that attitude like i am bothering you when i am paying cash for you to serve me food.",

The sausage is amazing and the buttery crust is delicious.  Plus the owner is a great, personable guy.  Forget Rosati's.  Forget the wannabes.  If you want a thick, authentic slice of the pizza that makes Chicago famous, come to Amore.",

Talk about top notch culinary perfection. I only enjoy one other calamari in town and that's on the Las Vegas strip, the flavor here burst through your mouth with the perfect layering of breading that literally melts in your mouth. The salt content combined with the tenderness make it a cant pass dish on your next visit!! WOW!",

Since then I've seen great reviews on Yelp and I've been craving stuffed pizza so I decided to give it a 2nd chance.  Had dinner there with my brother tonight and our food was amazing!  I ordered the deep dish with sausage and mushrooms.  So good!  Lots of flavor, tomato sauce was not overwhelming, and filled with cheese!  I brought some home to my wife and she enjoyed it too and she's not a big pizza person.  Will definitely come back and bring the family with me!",

We ate two slices of the pizza and all of the chicken...best of the worse. The blonde server was awful ...just sat at a table by the register a talked with a friend. We had to flag her down to place our order and she never came by to check our drinks. The lady working another table gave us better service. I was hoping the pizza would taste better the next day but it was a  total loss. The dining room wasn't full...only a couple other eat-in diners. Must have slacked off on my order. The canolli was excellent...the only positive to this dining experience.  Oh yea, we ordered a side of fries and they never arrived. No reason complaining...just got the heck out. Not worth the trouble.",

All the walls are filled with  our favorite Chicago sports hero's, plus celebrities. Plenty of TV's to watch Chicago sports.   Now the food, To start, the Bruschetta is awesome. This is a dish I make at home all the time, and it is the best I have ever had outside my house and my families 100+ year recipe.  Fried Mozzarella, always fresh, cooked perfect. Caprese salad is a must.  Main dishes.  They have a sandwich that rivals the breaded steak from Ricobenes. I was so happy to see this as Ricobenes is one of my all time favorites. Cooked with Turano bread from Chicago, good stuff. Pasta, cooked just right, and the gravy is good, not too sweet and not to bitter.  Thin crust Pizza, is pretty good, and I have not tried their Chicago Deep Dish, but that will be this week.  I will update this review as I try other items on their menu.   If your in town from Chicago, or have not been home in some time, get your butts over to Amore, and see and taste it for yourselves.",

The cashier said my order is ready,and instead of me checking it before I left wich is my fault. I should have checked it before I got  home. I called back I was put on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up called back,and asked to speak to the manager. She is no customer service savvy very young and rude.(Kenya) I told her. I got home and my pizza wasn't cooked all the way. it was doughey and raw. I also mentioned There wasn't hardly any sausage on it. for $22 and some change they can stick it. I also ordred some friend zucchini. wich were soggy. My brother told me to write this review too. lol. They SUCK!!!! I posted pictures so you can see the dough. I even put it in my own oven for another 28 minutes on 400 degrees,,,,,and it still wasn't cooked all the way. I wound up throwing this crap in the trash!!!! I will never ever be back. and to be honest I see why the place was empty too. Also when your running a CHICAGO establishment. don't have your employees wearing Carolina wear in your restraunt, to me that isn't professional supporting another team!!!",

She assured me that their pizza rivaled Lou Malnatti's in Chicago.  My curiosity being sufficiently aroused, my husband and I decided to try their stuffed one topping pizza.  Once we did, we were hooked.  We haven't had pizza this good since we took a trip to Chicago six years ago and tried Lou Malnatti's.   The crust had just the right amount of thickness.  The cheese on top was so rich, and buttery it melted in our mouths.  One of those slices should and would have been enough, but I was super hungry and the taste was so addictive, I decided to have a second piece and call it \"dessert\".  It is so nice to know that there is a pizza restaurant in town that knows how to make pizza that delicious. What a treat!",

I ordered delivery and it was on time but no updates that it's being delivered on the Yelp Eat24 app.  Since this is a Chicago style pizza place that's what I ordered. The pizza was nasty- no evidence of actual marinara sauce, just big chunks or canned tomatoes.  The crust was so wet on the bottom I had to eat it with a fork. I ate one piece and my friend ate 2....the rest went to the dumpster as there was no way I'd eat it ever again.  To make matters worse, or perhaps on par with the pizza experience, the delivery guy hands me a banged up can of soda we ordered and says \"I hope you weren't planning on drinking this anytime soon\" because he dropped it. wtf?

I didn't call to complain because by the time it was all over I was pretty disgusted, and I decided to simply not order food from them anymore and to leave this review. I ate their only once before and it was very good - excellent pizza, good service, etc,   This was a multiple rib order. We ALWAYS order ribs and any bar-b-que with the sauce on the side, regardless of the establishment, and not only was each order slathered and drowning in sauce, but it was a terrible thin sauce like something watered down out of a bottle. They were soggy because of so much sauce, \"soggy\" being the keyword to this terrible dinner. The delivery was quick, less than thirty minutes, I live less then three miles away, but the French fries were a soggy pile like they had been in the container for hours. We also had the large order of mozzarella sticks that should have been eight for almost twelve dollars, but we got the small order of four, still being charged for the large. They too were soggy like they had been microwaved. The soggy cornbread came wrapped in plastic which will immediately compromise the quality of anything - you don't put hot food in plastic and expect something edible, but I have to go back this sauce thing. This was an eighty dollar order and it looked like a child had put it together, there was absolutely no regard to what we ordered. The ribs themselves weren't bad but this place needs to re-train their cooks as to how to add sauce to bar-b-que, and how to prepare food that won't be served right away. And their six dollar delivery fee is uncalled for, especially considering the overall price of this order.   The only redeeming thing about what we got was the baked beans. That's all.",

Ordered a thick crust today with 4 toppings . Looked okay when I picked it up . At home a few minutes later we discovered the center was cold and under cooked . The crust edge was a bit burned but the middle was soggy . The Crushed tomato was raw . Called and they offered me a return trip . No thanks . A $32 pie I had to finish cooking . Manager said it would be noted but what else ? Tells me the cook will never hear about it . I would have offered to deliver another free but hey - I'm a back east guy and this is 2019 corporate Las Vegas . Good luck with that .",

    "text": "I love Chicago food, in fact the only thing that matches my love for good deep dish pizza is my disdain for Chicago winters. I came in here after hanging with some friends and I immediately fell in love with everything. The stuffed pizza is layers and layers of deliciousness. The slices are so big you might need you might need a partner to help you lift them.   What I will say that makes this place stand apart is that it's more than just a pizzeria. They have a whole menu of entrees. I got to try the stuffed shells and the chicken. I heard the calamari was pretty good but I was entirely too stuffed. The food was just too good and I can't say no when bruschetta is put in front of me.  Another thing I will say I liked was the vibe. All the girls I interacted with were super nice. The service was on point, no too overbearing but made sure I was taken care of. One thing I super appreciated was that one of the servers, Kiana, remembered me and treated me like a regular who comes here daily even though I haven't been here many times. Things like that make a difference   Overall this is a pretty dope place in a good location that I see myself returning to in the future",

    "text": "Time for some tough love.  Okay, I've now been here twice. Unless a place blows me away the first time, I like to take an average of two experiences to get a feeling for what a famished future me could expect. Usually the experiences are pretty similar; but at this place, not at all. My friend has been coming here for years, and warned me of their inconsistency. I really wanted him to be wrong, but alas, he was not.  LAST MONDAY: We ordered the fried ravioli as the appetizer, a medium deep dish pizza, and the order of two Vienna hot dogs with fries.   Really enjoyed the fresh bruschetta that they brought complimentary while we looked over the menu for our first time. It added nicely to the experience, and it was delicious.  Pizza was my favorite. Such a great taste, with buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and of course, a melty mess of mozzarella. The ravioli was pretty standard, with the gooey cheese inside and a warm marinara on the side. And the hot dogs were (surprisingly) delicious. A good snap, with crisp, fresh veggies, perfectly steamed bun; and the crunchy fries along side. Couldn't really ask for anything more.   The service last week was OKAY. The young girls up front are nice, but kind of unhelpful. They seemed preoccupied with absolutely everything except the customers. Also, pretty sure hair needs to be pulled back and not falling forward if you're serving food according to the health district. Just kind of seems unprofessional and unappetizing. Out of four or five girls, only one had their hair up.  THIS MONDAY: Came in around the same time as last week, around 7pm. This time, ordered the fried mozzarella to start, followed by two orders of the double Chicago dogs, and one order of the Italian Beef Sandwich.  Let me start off by saying that EVERYTHING was completely inconsistent with the quality we experienced last week. This time, the food all tasted very bad, like the chef temporarily lost the use of his taste buds, or didn't even try the food being sent out.  As sad as this makes me, I wouldn't eat the beef sandwich again if you paid me. It was honestly inedible and disgusting. The meat tasted old and flavorless, the au jus was barely lukewarm and overspiced (read: overcompensated with spices), and the bread was borderline stale.  And don't even get me started on the hot dogs; aka the biggest disappointment of my life.   Where did that warm, soft, steamed bun from last week go? Gone; replaced with a bun that probably was from the same batch LAST WEEK. This bun was dry, stale, and unappetizing. The hot dog had a little too much \"snap\" this week, which made it seem like it was cooked or kept warm for a very long time and wasn't fresh. It had the taste of an old hot dog, like one that had fallen through the grill and been forgotten about. Except ALL FOUR hotdogs tasted like that. Disgusting. Left them on the plate barely eaten.  Even the bruschetta at the beginning of the meal was weird. None of us liked it. At all. It seemed mushy, and old, and wayyyyy too salty.  The ONLY GOOD THING about our second experience was the fantastic service. We had Bianca as our server. She was extremely attentive, very helpful in answering our questions, and accommodating with our requests. When we brought up the concerns with the food, she apologized and offered us a complimentary dessert for the shortcomings. Two of us declined, but my fiance opted for the chocolate chip cheesecake to fill the void of the subpar hot dogs she ordered. This was a nice touch. We really felt heard, and Bianca assured us that the owner takes this feedback to heart and will make sure that our next experience will meet the high expectations we formed from our amazing first visit.  First experience: Four Stars. Five for food, minus one for service.  Second experience: Three stars. Literally zero for food, but plus three for Bianca's professionalism.  3.5 stars. Let's call it 3 flat, for inconsistency.  I am so hesitant to come back, but I will probably have to have a tie-breaker, and will update when that happens.",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars I would. The service and the way I treated tonight was unbelievably unacceptable. I placed an order at 4:09pm via Grubhub, a salad and 4 meatballs. The estimated time of arrival was between 4:55pm and 5:05pm. At 5:22pm my order had just been picked up, the app was never updated, only saying it was still being processed. At 5:48 I was told my order would be there in 5mins. At 6:25pm, literally 30mins later, I finally received my order. Literally 2hrs and 20mins after I ordered. Obviously the meatballs were cold, not the end of the world but when you miss your estimated time of arrival by 1hr and 20mins and you only offer me a 20% discount, that's just inexcusable. I talked to the \"manager\" who has no sense of customer service especially in the restaurant business. 20% was about $4 off. What a slap in the face. Amore hires young people to run the restaurant that clearly do not know the business. This is not how you get repeat customers. Zero apologies, just \"I can offer you 20% off.\"",

I will qualify by saying I am from Chicago-land and grew up in our family pizzeria. As with all foods there are differences in flavor and how it is prepared. This however is not even close to me. The owner is from Bolingbrook Ill, a suburb of Chicago. I was told this from a waitress. it may be that it is a local flavor. The wait staff were not attentive at all and it was slow at the time. Maybe 3 other tables. The staff just kept hanging around the front counter talking and laughing with each other.  Now for the food, The first time I visited we had d deep dish that the dough was almost raw in the middle. Defiantly not cooked. The grease from the young, not aged cheese pooled on top. Not a good meal. Next couple times we tried the thin crust. Thin crust has always been my favorite and was what Chicago pizza was known for before the deep dish craze, A thin wafer crisp crust cut in squares. Missed on this too. The crust was limp and thick, The sauce both times tasted like it was just puree out of a can, no spices added. Just plain pastie. The crust tasted very heavy with yeast. So much so that it over powered the taste. I ordered The ribs to find the were a bit dry and tasted old. The BBQ sauce was bland and heavy with smoke flavor.  I had so much hope for this place. Sorry to say it has been a disappointment.",

The atmosphere is very family friendly, not dark and smokey like so many of it's peers.  Try it... you won't regret it...",

First discoverd this place about 3 years ago and been eating here every so often.   2 Orders that made me an Instant Fan:  1. Chicken Vesuvio: A Pair of Chicken Skinless Chicken Fillet drenched in a pool of olive oil with herbs, spices and Garlic! I Mean Infused with Garlic! And 4 Large Slices of Potato Wedges. Presented on a Large Rectangle Plate.. Just Beautiful! Nicely Portioned and Taste So Gooood!  2. Deep Dish Pepperoni & Sausage Pie: Takes them approximately 45 minutes to prepare! Now this was more of a Pizza Pie! Thick, Saucey, Not too Cheesy and Toppings (especially the sausage) were a Hit! The Crust kind of crumbled like a Apple Pie crust. I haven't had too many Deep Dish Pies but this one is much better than Rosati's by a few miles!!  * Other Orders Not quite as good but decent: Chicken Marsala, Spaghetti with Meatballs (meatballs enormous like Buca Di Beppo), Minestrone Soup, House Salad with creamy garlic dressing (dressing kinda sweet).   When I feel Deep Dish Pizza Pie, I come here. If I'm not feeling CPK's \"Chicken Milanese\" (btw one of their healthiest entrees and its damn good!) but still want chicken thats more unique, I come here for the Vesuvio. Service average but our Last Visit here the Service was Better. More Prompt and Comforting because of our server: \"Erica\". Thanks! Prices a little high but worth the treat once in a while, in my opinon.",

    "text": "So we see the commercials all the time and after two years of living here decide to try Amore's. We drive from downtown 25 minutes each way to get there on a Sunday around noon. No one is in there. A strip mall cheap place with posters on the walls and cheap looking plastic red chairs. No beer either... I wanted the specialty pizza, but half margarita and half pepperoni. Other places do it like Grimaldi's. But not here. So ok, I order a margarita pizza and just add some pepperoni on it. It came out with red sauce. I asked the server if I had the right pizza and was assured I did. I ate a couple of pieces. Then asked another server if a margarita pizza should have red sauce instead of white. Of course it's white. So she states maybe they were just out of white sauce. She comes back from the kitchen and said they made a mistake so I had pepperoni with spinach on it. I had eaten about 25% of it to this point. I stated, it was just ok pizza and I didn't feel like I should have to be forced into eating something I did not order  and advised I didn't want to pay for it. She rudely said, if you eat it you will pay for it. I said, then take it now. Really, no better option. Was I supposed to wait another 40 minutes after others where done... Grrr...So I did not eat. We contacted the owner through the Chicago Facebook page, he said he'd look into it. Nine days later he finally replied \" why don't we just come back there and have a free pizza on him\". Really.., drive another 45 minutes round trip passing other pizza places I love like Grimaldis, Pieology and Pizza Rock. They could have made it right the first time and chose not too. No thanks. I never will return no matter how much advertising they do, not worth it.",

We especially like deep dish w/a cornmeal crust.  Anyway we came to Amore to try our luck.    There were a lot of people in the restaurant  but luckily we were seated right away.  The service was good, and the staff was friendly.   We liked the fact that there are large screen TVs you can see from every angle.  This is good to know in case there's a game we want to watch.    We shared the mozzarella appetizer among four of us and we all enjoyed it.   The toppings on the pizza were spot on.  The homemade sausage, the sauce, etc. were all very good but we found the crust to be a bit bready.  The crust was lighter than most but noticed it was thicker in some areas of the pie. Another reviewer said that there was too much corn meal in the crust but I didn't notice any in ours.      I would like to come back and try their other dishes (their menu is quite extensive). Their homemade sausage is great; so, no doubt their sausage & peppers are too.       I noticed that the lasagne on another table looked pretty good so maybe I'll try that next.",

Friday night at 6 pm decided to give it a try. The pizza was fantastic and the service was the best since we have been in Vegas. We went to several nice and expensive restaurants at the casinos, but the service here was outstanding. We were seated right away and all of the waitresses helped each other. Everyone was friendly and helpful including the bus staff.  Everyone smiled and was right on point. We ordered mozzarella triangles as an appetizer that were lightly breaded and hot.  The deep dish pepperoni pizza was incredible!!  I can't say enough.  The little bit of a drive off the strip was definitely worth it and we will be back next year during the conference. I would recommend the restaurant and pizza to everybody!  Thank you for a great last night dinner!  Shelly from Arizona",

Okay not better than Lou Malnati's, but considering we're almost 2000 miles away from Chicago and Lou's and I'm comparing it to Lou Malnatis and it has more stars than 0....There you go.   There's butter in the crust, which is just the perfect thickness; crisp but not crunchy, soft inside but not soggy...tangy tomato sauce, cheese on the bottom, loaded with toppings. How do you know it's Chicago Style? You can pull a slice out with a pie slicer, and the crust is firm, and the inside stays all in one piece, with little dangly mozzer-elactites. Like a blueberry pie...made of meat.   These are not just people claiming \"yeah it's a heavy crust so we call it 'Chicago Style'  and hope no one notices.\" This is not a wet gooey mess of sauce and toppings on bread. This is actually Chicago style deep dish, at it's best. Better than Giordannos in Chicago proper, if you ask me.  In Chicago, I'd give it 4 stars, since it's not Lou Malnatti's. Here? Oh heck yeah it gets 5 stars here.  Pros: - Name of Restaurant Not a Dirty Filthy Lie. This is what Actual Chicago Style Pizza tastes like. - Good food, good prices - They deliver, and it's fast for chicago style. (allow 45 minutes for cook time)  Cons; - Allow 45 minutes for cook time.",

But, I'm able to put my prejudice aside to properly evaluate this offering...    First, their sauce is overly sweet, it has been obviously and emphatically juiced with sugar.... Second, the crust is under-developed, and too crispy (like having a 1/2\" cracker on bottom)... Lastly, the butter or butter-like grease they use for the release agent on the pan is overpowering and left me feeling like I just ate a tub of movie popcorn.

Stopping in for lunch, Grace ordered the small appetizer of chicken wings and I ordered the lunch version of the meatball sandwich. Both orders were perfect... the meatball sandwich, with fries, was almost too much to finish! Three large meatballs on an Italian roll..it was half of a regular roll...and smothered with marinara sauce and a slice of melted provolone cheese..five stars isn't enough for this place! Watched a couple of guys finish a deep dish pizza..smh..dunno if it's safe to eat that much in one sitting! But the food is THAT good! XLNT!",

It came cut in squares - yay! The sausage was delicious, that's something I don't take for granted.  We also had a small Caesar salad, which was large for a small! It had too much dressing on it for my taste, but my husband didn't mind. The lettuce could have been greener and crisper, and better croutons. It was edible, but there's room for improvement.  Our waitress was sweet. There's plenty of TV 's and Chicago sports decor. We'll come back on future visits.",

Fiance wasn't upset with it though :) will definitely order from Amore again! Fast delivery too! Thanks!",

The only thing that would be better is if they would be willing to deliver the pizza just a little over five miles maybe make it six miles . IF they would expand their delivery territory to maybe 6 miles out they would get a lot more business. We live 5.5 miles away so we go pick it up. Delivery would be better. Their Italian beef sandwiches are just perfect. Pizza is THE BEST.",

I'll never understand someone's reasoning for taking a circular pizza and cutting it into squares... square pizza, square slices I get. I know they do it in Chicago, been there done that, and it didn't make sense then either. The pizza was good and I did like the sauce which is a little on the sweet side. The ricotta was quite good, no up charge!, and the mushrooms hit the spot but there just wasn't enough of them. All in all we thought it was a pretty good pizza but when their website says a large is for 3-4 people they must not be talking about anybody who's hungry, we devoured it in no time. Not a bad spot for pizza but Ciao Ciao is less than a block away and for us it's more in line with what we like.",

We had garlic bread, dinner salad, zuchini sticks, ribs and fries, mushroom thin crust pizza and a pepperoni deep dish pizza.  The pizzas were wonderful and the zuchini sticks were good too.  The best thing in my opinion, which we actually ordered for the kids, were the ribs.  I've never had better ribs anywhere! Who woulda guessed?  I like the salad and the garlic bread, but if I were to go back, I would have ribs and fries with an appetizer of zuchini sticks.  Great service, not too long of a wait (we have three kids and a long wait would not be fun).  It was super busy and we were seated in about 10 minutes.  Deep dish pizzas take about 40 min, but the time flew by.  They recommended we call ahead to order it in advance next time.  Super impressed!!",

When I got home, I got ready to eat the spaghetti. There was no fork or napkins, which is a no no in my book... What if I was staying in a hotel??  Or just the fact that I hate doing dishes, even if it is only a fork. Annoying. While eating the spaghetti, I was quite content. It was very delicious. I started to realize it was very salty, though. There is enough for lunch tomorrow, which is a positive. If I recall, they used to give you a side salad with your dinner... High price and no side salad, not cool. Definitely delicious, though.

Strike 2- if it was okay where it was, why say anything?  The restaurant was not busy at all, baby stroller was not an issue at all, so why was it brought up?.  Our salad came and it was amazing, tasty and it was a perfect antipasto salad.  Our deep dish pizza came and this was an amazing pizza, very tasty and a perfect crust.  In the mean time my beer went empty and our other server who took our food order did not come back to the table for some time, when she did, she asked me if I wanted another, with my mouth full of food I could. Not answer but she grabbed my glass and empty bottle and left!  I was pissed!  She never asked if I'd even like a glass of water...she was not into the service thing. Overall I thought the food was outstanding and the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review was the poor service.",

They assisted as needed and did so w/a smile.   2. Food was a 3.5- the complimentary bruschetta was delicious!!! I'd rate that a 5 all day. The pizza was just a 3. I liked browned/well done cheese and if you look at the pics it wasn't achieved. I actually picked all the cheese off. The Pizza was still ok, but not the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. It kind of reminded me of Palermo's on 95th out south. I believe their other dishes would hit a homerun, just not the pizza.   3. Drinks are very reasonable. Most glasses of wine were only $5. Merlot, chardonnay, etc.   The facility was Chicago themed all the way. From the Bozo show pics, to the sport teams, & mob ties. GO HARD OR GO HOME CHICAGO STAND UP!!!!! I'd come back & try other items that looked tasty.",

What hits you next is the smell.  The smell of the food you have been waiting for.  You are seated and treated to a free plate of bruschetta, a delicious garlicky treat of bread topped with tomatoes.  We then proceeded to order fried mozzarella and fried calamari fro appetizers.  Both of these were good but far from the best I've had, lucky for us the pizza made up for it.  We got a thin crust sausage which again, not the best I've had but still good.  I must say I was very impressed by the deep dish.  The crust was buttery and the filling was cheesy, meaty, saucy, and all sorts of delicious and it was just the right size, especially after all of the appetizers and the thin crust.  I did not try the cannolies but my date very much enjoyed them.  I do wish they were closer to me but I guess being far will make me crave it even more.  I will be back.",

Jennifer greeted us with a big smile and a warm welcome.    We ordered or drinks and looked over the menu.   I asked what is considered a \"favorite\" dish.    She suggested the meatball or chicken Parm sandwhich, then she suggested so many other items my head was spinning and I really like meatball sandwhiches.    We call them Grinders or a \"grindah\" in Rhode Island.  My boyfriend wanted to start with cheddar cheese fries ($4.45), he wanted to try theirs Gyro ($6.95) and I went with a meatball sandwhich with cheese ($8.45).    If you add fries it's $10.90.   After dinner was fantastic I really wanted to try their homemade Tiramisu ($4.95), the lady fingers (the cookie in the middle) was soaked in rum, it was to die for.   Even tried a tiny bite of the cheesecake here and it too was great.  Only wished it was a slightly thicker slice for $4.95.  This is a sports heaven on 10 different good sized TVs!      Definitely bring your group of friends to watch sports.      We will be back to give the pizza a second try.",

Now being from Chicago, I have never seen this used on any pizza outside of frozen. Apparently if I let them know at the time of order that I want the wide thin cut, they will put it on. I asked to speak to the manager/owner @ 6:10pm on a SAT night, and was told they weren't there.   I will gladly add a star to here when someone tells me why you would use an inferior pepperoni.",

More sizable than one would gather from the exterior and brighter than many places of its ilk as a result of large windows exposed to the strip-mall parking lot out front, it was to an empty dining room that we arrived as doors clicked open and remaining that way throughout the duration of our 60 minute stay the service was expectedly attentive, pies requested to be delivered as completed with thin crust presented after a mere ten minute wait.  Admittedly benefited by a Midwestern upbringing, not to mention a sister who lives minutes from Wicker Park, suffice it to say that the circle cut into rectangles was far less novel to me than it may be to others while tomato sauce seemingly straight from a can did little to improve rather flavorless crust, the mozzarella not particularly impressive either while Pepperoni was the typical oily store-bought stuff.  Not really expecting much from the deep-dish considering the overall quality of the traditional pie it was with a medium-thick version removed from the pan and served atop cardboard that the meal progressed, the same ingredient quality generally marring crust that would have been better off with more butter left to caramelize though the sausage and mushrooms were a touch more successful than pepperoni  as toppings, each cannoli perfectly serviceable with a shattering shell filled to order, though  far from the best available in town.  **Generally not the sort to assume that Las Vegas should meet or exceed the quality of signature dishes from cities a thousand or so miles away, Amore Taste of Chicago simply is not as good as any of the classics offered within the confines of The Second City, a more substantial search necessary to see if it is even the best in the (702.)",

You can pick up your pizza or sit & enjoy pizza with waitress service. Shelby our waitress was terrific. I called her Chelsea in my check in and she is so good natured, she was laughing & saying she like that name too! The kitchen closed right after our pizza came out & Chelsea to the rescue got JARDINIERE for my husband. He was thrilled to enjoy some with his pizza.     Coke comes in a can out of the fridge. It would be even better if they offered the Mexican Coke from Costco:)  cane sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup.    No alcohol is served so BYOB.   The walls are decorated with Chicago faces... BOZO the clown, Ernie Banks and Ron Santo of Cubs fame, #23 Michael Jordan... & a T-Shirt from Mother's on Division.  If you are a Chicago native, you will feel like you are back home.   The deep dish pizza is truly Chicago style. For sure the best Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas that I have tasted. Order extra sauce & extra cheese & ONE piece may fill you up, which is great as they wrap it up to take home.   It is addictive... Definitely a dangerous find for my diet. LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT",

I was really excited about trying it that I brought my dad from out of town there too. I also had my two small children with us. We ordered the stuffed pizza along with the calamari appitizer. My husband and I ate most of the calamari. I woke up at 330a violently throwing up and diarrhea. I'm am still sick at 430p. My husband is also very sick with, fever, diarrhea, and throwing up. I am very thankful that my two small kids did not eat any of the calamari. This was the only thing my husband and I ate that was the same. I will never walk back in there which is unfortunate because the pizza was good. If they aren't cooking or storing the calamari correctly what else isn't being stored right? Very disappointed. Would love to get my money back... I didn't pay to puke all night and be sick.",

    "text": "My first time at Amore was far from a positive one. As suggested by several reviews, I called ahead to have a deep dish put in for us to dine in later. They told us it would take about 45 minutes to get done, which we expected, so we showed up about 30 minutes in to make sure we didn't get cold food. Well, we ended up getting a cold pizza anyway, and even worse, there was hair in it. When we told our waitress, she acted like there was no way it could have happened and made excuses. To be fair, they offered to make a new pizza, but I sure didn't want to wait there another 45 minutes, and I honestly don't know who would.  Before I found the hair, I still can't say I agree that the deep dish is the best out there. I definitely wouldn't recommend sitting in the place for 45 minutes to wait for it to come out either. Maybe it's because mine was cold and I didn't get the full effect, but I just wasn't a huge fan. There was very little flavor to it, the cheese not being hot and melty wasn't ideal, and the dough felt undercooked. As a whole, it just wasn't right and was really disappointing after hearing how great it's supposed to be.  About the only thing I enjoyed on my first visit were the appetizers we ordered. Both the Fried Ravioli and Bruschetta were simple but delicious, and I'd recommend trying either.  Against my better judgement, we came back here for a second time...more because it's one of the wifeys favorite spots. This time around, almost everything was much better. Our waitress was extremely nice, had our drinks refilled quickly, and it was overall just a much better experience. I couldn't bring myself to order another deep dish, so this time around I tried something new with the Sausage and Peppers Platter...  I'm actually really surprised to see this isn't talked about more in reviews. It's literally served on a platter with a pretty healthy portion of sausage, peppers, potatoes and onions. The sausage is a nice coarse ground Italian sausage that is cooked perfect, and has just the right amount of spice. Both the peppers and onions were nicely done with still a little bit of crispness and not soggy at all. But what really makes this dish even better is the white wine sauce it's made with. It's absolutely delicious, and everything really soaks in all the flavors from it. Even after I was stuffed from eating it all, I couldn't help but grabbing some of their basket bread and dipping it in the sauce...it really is that good!  Had I reviewed Amore the first time around, it definitely would have been a 1 star review. There really isn't much that I hate more than finding stuff in my food, and usually I wouldn't even go back after I do, especially if it's hair. But I gotta give credit where credits due. The Sausage and Peppers Platter alone is worth coming here for. And if we were to come back with someone who wanted a deep dish, I'd probably give it another shot. I just wouldn't order it again on my own, and with it being one of their signature items, that says a lot.  Overall though, Amore is \"A-OK\"!",

Luckily for me I love all style of pizzas so I probably wouldn't get into a heated debates over pizza, except if your going to debate with me about a crappy pizza and you think they're good. Crappy pizza is never good, Angelina's Pizzeria on Decatur is one crappy pizza.  Deep dish Chicago pizza is probably my favorite, I have forever been a can, so of course I really enjoyed the pizza at Amore Taste of Chicago. The pizza here is one of my favorite reasonably priced, non-franchised deep dish Chicago pizza in the valley. Now I'm not going to compare it to those in Chicago, which I've had, but they're pretty good for what we have.    Last time there I went with a large pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta deep dish <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amore-taste-of-chicago-las-vegas?select=CSDhvcFR9fFLUp40PiS_KQ#1SB8fDGKC1vblo_sSs-YjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/amor...</a> It took about 45 mins to make. It was delicious. It was filled with all my favorites. I enjoyed the sauce and other ingredients. The pizza was thick and heavy and I ate it with a fork and knife.  It didn't seem so greasy and it held it's shape when picked up.  The taste of the crust was kind of missing something but overall 4 star deep dish pizza. I liked the interior too.  Red, my favorite color. Jordan, the best basketball player EVER!!! Other Chicago memorabilia. Spacey with a lot of tables, chairs, and a couple big screen TVs.  I can't review about their other items but I liked looking at the pics, they look good.",

Honestly, I think I've only has Chicago deep dish one other time when I was actually in Chicago at Gino's East. I'm going to go ahead and say the Amore's has them beat.  There were 8 people in our party and we ordered a deep dish with meatball & ricotta and a thin crust with sausage & pepperoni. Everything was fantastic. I felt like all of the ingredients were really fresh, perfectly proportioned, and both crusts were outstanding.  Our server, Autumn, was running around the dining room & our table still never felt neglected. She was awesome!  Salads and cannoli were great, too!  I am not a sports fan, but there are huge TVs around so you can catch the game no matter where you are sitting.  Definitely worth checking out.",

We did delivery- ~$60 for two deep dishes with veggie toppings and one with the additional sausage for the omnivores. I was satisfied and full. Yet my standard has been set mercilessly high. Definitely a place to check out, but be mindful of what else is out there in the sea of deep dish pizza.",

    "text": "I was VERY close to giving a 4, but I couldn't do it.   My friend just moved to town in December from Chicago and he has been dying to try this place since he moved. We finally made a date of it, and went!  When we arrived, it was a pretty cool family-style table setting. Lots of cool decor on the walls, and fun atmosphere. I had made a reservation since it was Mother's Day, but they were not at all busy. Some large families in there celebrating mothas.   Now to keep this semi-short, let me just tell you... My friend ordered the Italian Beef Sandwhich, plus we ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage & pepperoni, and I had the Chicken Parm (original, I know).   My chic parm was above average. However, the server messed up my order though and brought me the wrong pasta even after we had a very clear conversation on which one I wanted, but she took care of it, within a NON-timely manner. Oh wait for it.   My friend ordered the Italian Beef said it was bland and left much to be desired.   The deep dish pizza on the other hand was amazing. Very good. It deserves a 5.  My parm deserves the 4.   Here is where the 3 plays in.   Service. Should be a 1. This waitress who was a s blonde to the core, with all the stererotypes to back it up.... had 3 tables, a two top, us (another two top) and a 4 top who was already served. She took 20 min to finally come take our order. She would constantly disappear and as I said earlier, brought out the wrong order of pasta. And don't even THINK about refills of their pepsi products (gross) Then at the end, we were looking forward to trying a Cannoli. I have never had it before, and this ditz of a waitress shows up, drops off our check and walks away.   RUDE!  So we then had to flag another waitress down and ask for the dessert. Talk about a waste of a good evening! What could have easily been a 5 star night, turned into 3 because the lack of care and attention the staff paid.  At least the food was decent. Sadly, due to lack of service, in a Service-driven town, I am in no rush to return.    The Cannoli was good. I have since tried it at 2 other places (one being the M Buffet) , which in turn made me think the one I had here was average.    My advise, try it for yourself, keep your expectations low, and maybe you will enjoy it more than we did. Focus on the food, the deep dish, yum.   Hey! That's better than me suggesting you avoid it all together, right?",

The girl who answered the phone (who sounded like she has a 12 year old vocabulary and who has the personality of a stiff tree) told me that because the pizza takes 30 minutes to make, she wouldn't be able to make me what i want or any other kind of pizza for that matter. Now i understand that the restaurant closes at 10pm and the employees wanna go home, but seriously! Come on now! Would it have really killed them to stay a measly 10 minutes passed closing to make a simple pizza if it means gaining a potential, long term customer??? Geez!!! It's not like I rolled up in there at 9:59pm asking for a pizza!!! That would be inconsiderate.  I usually eat pizza for lunch or for early dinner.....never really passed 7 or so so it's not like i would have made it a habit to go later. Also, I'm one who also works in customer service and i too have kids to go home to, but to stay a couple minutes longer once in a blue moon to make someone happy has never once bothered me or my family! Small businesses have way too much competition with other small business owners and definitely with bigger chain businesses like Little Caesars and Pizza Hut  (despite the fact that Amore is \"chicago style\" pizza) to be so damn petty about making a pizza a few minutes passed closing time! To be honest, it doesn't even taste like chicago style! It's somewhat close and it's not bad tasting, but it's still las vegas' version of chicago style! Smh!!!",

Never in my life have I actually experienced cheese hanging off the pizza after I take my slice. The ingredients they use must be fresh or they get the good stuff because you can taste the quality. It's pricey for a pizza but it's worth it. The pizza takes awhile to make but it's worth the wait and having pretty girls to look at isn't bad either. It is just overall great pizza. It's like cheese, bread, pepperoni and tomato sauce all had an orgy and some how they all got pregnant, fused and made one big baby, then I come along and I eat their delicious pizza baby and bite into it and have all their delicious orgasmic flavors in my mouth, but it doesn't make me gay because the pizza was a girl, that's how damn good it is.",

    "text": "I want to publicly apologize for the years I adamantly preached that thin crust pizza is best.  Amore changed my pizza loving ways forever. So--dear eaters--I sincerely apologize for not listening to you Chicago deep dish lovers.  I was so wrong.  Amore is one of those pizza joints that you pass by while driving home, but never take the time to stop in.  Since I'm a bit adventurous at the moment, I decided to cancel my mail order deep dish from Chicago (from Lou Malnati's) and take my mother here for some Italian.  There are two reasons I chose this place out of all places in Vegas - 1) the reviews are oustanding, and 2) the chicago deep dish pizza.    When you first walk in, you see a casual eatery; the usual metal chairs and chicago-dressed 4 top tables fill the seating area.  There's sports memorabilia on counters, and posters on walls. But forget the decor--the scent of cheese and pasta should get you excited when you walk in the door.  The staff is friendly and will tell you what is best when you ask.  I trust the staffers, since they eat the food for lunch daily.  The consensus? - Ribs, deep dish, and lasagna.  The girls say that the ingredients are from home (Chicago), so it tastes just as good, if not better.  It takes 45 minutes for a deep dish'er, but trust me--it is worth the wait.  The appetizer list is short and sweet.  We went for the usual fare--some breaded mushrooms with ranch dressing.  Their breading is well seasoned, crispy and isn't oily at all.  There were no grease stains on the plate even after sitting for a few minutes.  The lasagna is creamy, layered with sliced sausage and ricotta and dressed with a fresh tomato sauce that is so darn good.  I like the sliced sausage or meatballs in the lasagna and LOVE the cheesiness.  The sauce, with it's tangy kick balances the sausage and  cheese out well.  The ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and they aren't slathered in sauce, which I appreciate.  It's sweet and smoky with a bit of spice and tang.  Served with lots of fries and some beans, it's a big boy dinner.  The star of the night was the deep dish pie we ordered.  The first time I laid my eyes on it I was excited to see the crust uneven.  The sauce is fresh and the cheese, decadent.  The first slice came up with the spatula followed by a strings of cheese, almost endless as I placed the first slice on my plate.  This is not your pick up and eat pizza; this requires a fork and knife.  The crust is flaky and buttery, well seasoned and so much fun to eat.  The cheese is creamy and unending, the sauce tangy but sweet, and the pepperoni crispy and gives just the right amount of saltiness to the dish.  The best part--the spicy kick in their sauce.  It's subtle, but there.  I ate half the pie, savored every bit of the crust, and wiped my plate with it to catch all the leftover cheese and gobs of sauce.  I did it all in complete silence and focus, mind you, finally coming up to breathe once I had my fill.    This joint is a great stop on anyone's Yelp to-try list. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled at first to try a deep dish pizza, but once I saw it was love at first sight, and marriage by the first bite.  You cannot beat great pizza, let alone great deep dish, and this place takes the pie.",

Now she loves it.  The chicken dishes are delicious, the Italian cuisine is excellent, and the deep dish beats even native Giordano's or Lou's! It is just great.  Combine the great food with great prices, amazing specials (a full rack of ribs on Wednesdays around $ 12!), and the best service... Amore's is well worth the drive from Henderson (or any other part of the valley)!",

    "text": "This place is pretty awesome. I came in here one day and they have pretty awesome lunch specials. $4.95! You can get half a sandwich (meatball, Chicago beef, or Italian sausage) with fries. These are good for lunch time.   If you really want something delicious though, you gotta get the deep dish pizza. It is delicoussssss!!!! The only down fall for me was I'm not a huge fan of pizza sauce being chunky and it is chunky and kinda sweet. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. If you do order the deep dish pizza though call in advance because it takes about an hour to make.   I have had the three sandwich lunch special mentioned previously.   The italian sausage was good. Not my favorite out of the three. You can add hot peppers to it for fifty cents I believe and same with the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich gives you a good amount of roast beef on it which more the better in my opinion.   The meat ball sub was good for an extra buck you can add cheese which is worth it because they give you a good amount. Plus it has, I believe, homemade meatballs on it. Pretty good stuff and the price is hard to beat. It's better than eating at a fast food place for the same price.   The service is good, they get you what you want in a good amount of time.   Good job guys.",

He died yesterday.\" She shrugged her shoulders and looked bored.  I said \"you must not be as in to baseball as we are.\"  She answered \"for sure\". The food was OK, but the service was non-existent.  The food was rapidly set down in front of us without comment.  We had empty water and ice tea glasses at that time and for the remainder of the meal.   Three stars for the food.  One star for the service. We were drawn to the restaurant because of the sports theme.  The enthusiasm for that theme might be important for the owner but is definitely not shared by the employees.   We will not be returning.",

I thought the service was excellent.   Pizza was True, Chicago style. Legit deep dish. We ordered homemade sausage and pepperoni and mushroom. The ingredients were all fresh. Loved that. Loaded with lots of fresh tomatoes on top too. My only complaint was the crust was a little undercooked in some places and I hate raw dough. I did think it lacked some salt in the sauce and maybe the toppings could have been a little more seasoned.  Ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was the worst part of the meal. Mostly containing the white hard parts of iceberg lettuce. You know, the stuff in the center you throw away!  The dressing was semi-sweet and bland. The whole thing tasted rubbery. Which led me to believe it was premade, dressed and stored in the fridge overnight. Unfortunately the salad was what killed the rating and the bland/raw crust pizza didn't make it 5 stars.",

We ordered a gluten free pizza WITHOUT cheese because my daughter is allergic. We also ordered an Italian beef; without cheese- simply because my husband didn't want cheese. Our food just arrived and there is cheese on the pizza. We called to let them know they messed up our order and we were told \"all sales are final\". There was no offer to refund, have us pick up a new pizza that my kid can eat or anything. I just paid for a slab of gluten free bread because the toppings can't even be eaten. Hey guys- guess what- I could have made her toast with tomato sauce and saved $13+ delivery. And next time I will. You've lost our business and I can tell you don't care. But you know what, it's really rude that YOU GUYS messed up and can't even make it right. I wonder if you just think people like us are pains in the asses for the fun of it? Or if you actually get that my money is just as good as anyone else's. My husband loves your food, but we won't be back. Total garbage service. And I just tossed that pizza in the trash. What a waste of time and money. Amazon Prime now is delivering me a cheese less gf pizza for my kid for half the price Edited to add: the fries we ordered are basically just oreida frozen crinkle cuts and they were half cooked and soggy upon arrival.

They have so many other items on the menu as well, Italian beef sandwhich, sausage & peppers, chicken parm... Yummy! Keep up the good work!!!",

The service was also excellent.  I cannot wait to go back.  Too bad LA is outside their delivery area...",

After looking at the menu and inquiring I learned they no longer offered hotdogs (the pics are still posted on yelp). We ended up ordering a small pepperoni & sausage pizza and the Italian beef sandwich ...OMG!   This was the best pizza we have had in a very long time...and we're no stranger to pizza; the ingredients were fresh and plentiful, the sauce was sweet yet tangy and coated the crust just enough, the thin crust just thin enough ( i typically don't eat thin crust)...and of course the pizza was bubbling hot, it was delicious!  The Italian beef sandwich was tasty too, it was flavorful, full of meat and I appreciated a generous portion of really hot (temp) juice for dipping...I did think the gardinar peppers could have been chopped a bit more...not as chunky.  We spent less than $20.  As we were leaving I assume he was the owner Mike introduced himself to us and was telling us about other menu items...it was a good feeling to know we were valued as customers (this is becoming rare).  We live right around the corner and will definitely be returning!",

Who knew that Vegas actually had a place that would cater to such need? Not I!  Thanks to Yelp, we made the trek here from the Vegas strip to grab italian beef sandwiches. The quality of meat was actually better than the average sandwich you normally get outside of Chicago. With the giardinera, it actually tasted rather authentic. The fries were hot and fresh - just how I like em! The service here was pretty good as well even though we were only three of about six patrons at the restaurant.  Most people who came in were ordering pizzas which makes me curious about how good those are. All in all, I wouldn't mind coming back here if I was actually in the area... Good stuff!",

We opted for a large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers plus a small cheese thin crust pizza. The total was about $35, not bad.  The crust was thicker than a typical NY style thin crust and was a little tough. Not chewy or crispy. I should have known better than to order a thin crust from a Chicago joint. I'm sure the deep dish would have been the better option. The pizzas weren't bad, there are just plenty of better spots for that style of pie.",

HUGE portions with the pasta, great unique chicken dishes. Always a treat.

    "text": "A few things I don't like discussing include my weight, salaries, and pizza. So the more New Yorkers and Chicagoans I met in Las Vegas that are fellow transplants like myself, the more difficult it became to avoid the topic of \"P.\" Here's why.   1. New Yorkers & Chicagoans love pizza. 2. New Yorkers & Chicagoans love to talk about how terrible pizza is outside of New York & Chicago.   When my sister was visiting from out of town and mentioned she wanted to give Chicago-style deep dish pizza a shot, I decided I'd rather forgo a long lecture of how the sacrament of pizza-making is lost in this city and just find a place with relatively decent reviews. I was feeling pretty YOLO-y that day, so Amore it was.   The joint is located in the same strip mall as Naked Fish, and the signage is old enough in Vegas years to be called vintage. Don't write it off yet just because the exterior is not at all spectacular. Walking in, it felt like a neighborhood, Cheers-esque kind of a pizza parlor where I imagine people would converge after football games if we could just do something about our damn Rebels. The fam bam and I ordered two medium stuffed pizzas - one with pineapple/bacon, and the other with sausage/mushroom.   \"Deep dish\" and \"stuffed pizza\" were apparently two different options, but to be completely honest, I'm not sure still what the difference was because as far as I'm concerned, it's just A LOT OF CHEESE, whichever way you go. It was a \"deep dish of cheese.\" Or, \"stuffed with cheese.\" All I know is that if you are lactose intolerant, you are SOL here. The service was fast and friendly, though be forewarned - either of these pizzas generally take around 45min to bake. The crust was a little thinner than I expected, considering the motherlode of queso it was holding up, but other than that, this is the place for those that are looking to truly relish in the ultimate cheat day. Or looking to start their diet...tomorrow.",

The sausage was very tasty, and the mushroom/spinach side was very good as well.  Good amount of cheese and the sauce is the perfect combo of sweet and tangy.  The appetizer of cheesy garlic bread was good, with a lot of garlic.  Bottomless soda is good, but getting the beer/wine option in will bring this to 5-stars.    The decor is nice with the Chicago theme.  Chairs are new, cushioned red and comfortable which is good if you order a deep dish or stuffed since it will take a full 45 minutes.  Definitely worth the wait and Amore will become a regular stop for me.  Note: they don't take Amex.",

    "text": "I fell in love with Chicago style deep dish pizza when I was visiting the windy city this past summer. Since then, I have been on a quest to find something comparable here in Vegas. I figure you can find just about any type of cuisine here in Vegas, but a Chicago style pizza seemed pretty hard to come by.  I'm happy my fellow yelpers mentioned Amore! There's a reason this place was packed just a  day after thanksgiving when most people are still trying to figure out creative ways to use turkey in casseroles, salads, volatil cocktails... ANYTHING just so that they can get rid of all that extra bird.  Instead, Amore was just the kind of \"love\" i needed after being slaving over a  hot  Thanksgiving  stove. The moment you walk in to this restaurant, it  feels like family, and everyone is so friendly and welcoming.    Situated in an unassuming strip mall next to a PT's pub, the scent of quality Italian cooking wafts throughout the quaint,  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcasual.restaurant&s=476be0a2bfb3263a2ef601e6e0c49a0c4d7fdf91c92de1b7b55d011cfe2cfd73\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">casual.restaurant</a>.  The Chicago style deep dish i ordered did not disappoint. The sauce was thick and hearty with chunks of tomato and a flavor like no other. I had it customized for me with no complaints from the server.  I'm giving this place 5 stars only because the owner promised that he'd be bringing back beer and wine to this establishment. That would make this place absolutely ideal because nothing goes better with pizza than a good beer to wash  it down.  It might be time for them to expand even further. Vegas can do without a PTs if it means there will be more room for me to  eat awesome Chicago style pizza and authentic Italian food at a great price.   definitely check this place out!  It's worth the trip.",

Before ordering, the waitress advised that the deep dish pies take 40 minutes, but taking a friend's recommendation about this place, we decided that a 40 minute wait wouldn't be too bad. And, oh boy, it was SO worth the wait! The crust on this pizza was dense and buttery. The pepperoni was crisp and the cheese was melted and stringy, just the way it ought to be! The sauce they use is sweet, but not overpowering. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because I felt that it should have had a bit more pepperoni on the pizza, and because the house salad and bread basket were nothing to write home about.

    "text": "Ok there are times you want a good pizza at a premium price and that's fine. Having said that this is my story. While watching the UFC 196 fight night we decided to order a pizza and not just any pizza, forget about Domino`s, Pizza hut, etc. So we ordered from Poppa Joe (Amore Taste Chicago). It was a simple order a medium pie 1/2 cheese & 1/2 Canadian bacon, and garlic, simple right? I go to pick up the pie get home and open the box and see what appears to be a plain cheese pie.  I called back and told the young girl that I believe the wrong pie was given to me. She asked me to bring it back and she would make me another pie, ok I have to go back again and the main event of the fight is just starting, so I rush back to the restaurant to exchange the botched order. There in front of me is this young girl who takes the pie opens the box and say`s what`s the problem with the pizza, I simply asked where`s the Canadian bacon, she then grabbed a tooth pick and started to lift the cheese and literally found about 6-8 pieces of Canadian bacon and no garlic.  She then said that this is the right pie and stated to me that if I wanted to exchange it she would have to charge me. Needless to say I was at a loss for words and could not believe what I was hearing. I will not order another thing from this place after the experience that I had. I don`t know if Poppa Joe reads thes reviews or doesn't care but I have been going there sometime`s for lunch or ordering for pick up since 2008. This is sad because coming from Chicago I support my hometown people. It looks like Rosatti`s will get all of my future orders. So long Poppa Joe.",

It was uncomfortable eating dinner.   Our drink orders were brought out quickly and the young lady taking them was very nice. We decided to try the fried mozzarella and it was awesome. That was the only thing a out the meal that was good.   For an entree I ordered my son penne pasta with a meatball, I got the angel hair pasta with vodka sauce and sausage, and my husband and brother in law got a medium Chicago style pizza with mushrooms and sausage.   My son's pasta was brought out first (which I appreciate) but was undercooked. The sauce was alright. My son didn't care and ate it anyway (he's 2.5).  My pasta was overcooked and very mushy. The sauce and sausage were good.   The pizza, which was supposed to come out in half an hour but took an hour, was just okay. It was mostly sauce.   Towards the end our waitress became very snippy and nonexistent. Everyone has a bad day but she could have tried a bit harder. We didn't say anything and still tipped well.   And to top it all off this meal cost $70. It definitely was not worth $70.   Overall the place was mediocre. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there and we won't be trying it again. If you want a good Chicago style pizza try BJs. The price is fair and the pizza is awesome.",

    "text": "Our pal Lauren, who's from Chicago, has found a culinary Chi-town oasis here in Sin City, aptly known as Amore Taste of Chicago.  We dined there on a recent Friday evening in celebration of Lauren's birthday.  Amore serves up authentic Chicago-style pizza, which is what draws Lauren to this place on a regular basis.  She's also a fan of the staff, who were friendly and accommodating the night that Mike and I were there for the party.  Mike and I shared an order of cheesy garlic bread, which came with a side of marinara. The bread was toasty, the cheese gently melted: a nice appetizer.   For my entree, I chose Shrimp Diablo with crushed tomatoes and hot peppers on a bed of linguine. It's typically a pretty spicy dish, so I asked if they could tone it down for me. They agreed, and they delivered. It was still hot after a few bites built the spices up, but not nearly as much as it would have been. I adapted by repeatedly adding grated parm until the red sauce turned slightly orange. Strategic gulps of iced tea helped, too.  The sauce tasted fresh, and the linguine was al dente.  The only bothersome detail was the tails left on the shrimp. I know it looks better, but I hate it when restaurants do that, especially for hot dishes.  There's just no good way to remove the tails without burning yourself and/or making a big, saucy mess.   Mike, of course, decided on pepperoni pizza for his meal. This was no surprise. The man could live on pizza seven days a week; he loves it that much. He selected thin crust because we've been trying to cut down on carbs... or that's what we tell ourselves.  It was good.  The thick-crust pies were a sight to behold. They were huge and seemed to be packed full of meaty, cheesy, tomato-y goodness.  Here's a mushroom and sausage pie that Steve ordered.  Steve let me sample the crust, and it was delicious.    There are not a lot of options for dessert, but that's okay.  You're probably too full from the main course to eat it anyway, or you should be.  Still, Mike couldn't resist ordering some cannoli.  He made it contingent on me sharing with him, and I agreed.  I didn't want to let him down.  Aren't I a good wife?  Having eaten two pieces of garlic bread and half the shrimp, I was no longer hungry, but I managed to have a couple of tastes of the cannoli.  It was yummy.  Sometimes, if they've pre-filled them and left them sitting, the shells can get soft.  This one was crisp, breaking off with a satisfying crunch beneath our forks.  The cream was rich but not overly so, and the sweetness was just right with the chocolate chips.",

    "text": "I've eaten Amore Taste of Chicago pizza twice in the last month, due to a friend's recommendation. I would have to say that I was not disappointed based on the price and quality of food.  Upon walking in the ambiance is similar to a deli style experience you'd expect. Very basic tables with a ton of celebrity decor on the walls (some relating to Chicago, some relating to Las Vegas and some I have no idea about concering the relation).   Nevertheless, the service was very prompt even for a lunchtime. We ordered the Fried Ravioli and a large deep dish Chicago Style pizza with pepperoni (which was about $20). However, please note that if you're very hungry order an appetizer as the deep dish pizza has a wait time of approximately 45 minutes. This fact is stated on the menu clearly which I appreciated. The fried ravioli was decent, not the best I've had - but not bad. It's also served with a small bowl of marinara sauce.  When the pizza came out, I understood why it took 45 minutes to cook. It was probably about 6 pounds of dough, cheese and meat. The crust was buttery and flaky, the cheese was very gooey and liberally dispensed, the sauce was definitely made from actual stewed tomatoes and had a good taste and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. This was a lot of food. I was only able to eat one piece of this pizza and was definitely full. I also shared this pizza with two human garbage disposals that I've witnessed eat an inordinate amount of food in one sitting and they could only consume two pieces of this beast before they threw in the towel. We left with a box containing 3 large pieces of pizza.  I would definitely recommend Amore Taste of Chicago for anyone looking for Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas. I'm sure Chicagoans would disagree with me for this (as would New Yorkers about a restaurant touting New York Style pizza in Las Vegas). But on the sliding scale of pizza places in Las Vegas, this one definitely comes out high in my opinion.",

    "text": "Will not be ordering from here again which is kind of a shame because I was a regular at this place. Ordered Fried Ravioli, Bruschetta, and wings. The wings basically had no sauce on them and it was not apparent that the wings already came with ranch so I paid an extra dollar for 2 things of it I will not use.   Did NOT like the girls whom were working today everything someone said they had some snarky remark to make back and the one girl was complaining she was going to be there till 10 at night.. at least you have a job I know it can be frustrating at times but get over yourself. I waited 20 mins at home and an additional 10 at the restaurant for my food to be ready there was literally 3 people in there.   The cherry on top was I came home to realize I had not gotten the Bruschetta which is my favorite thing they offered. I called which I shouldn't have had to they had my name and phone # when I placed the order through Yelp so you'd think they'd call to be like hey we forgot to give you your Bruschetta but nope guess whining takes precedence over doing ones job.   She told me I could come back and get it but they couldn't offer a refund because I made the order through a 3rd party service. Okay well I can't leave my job a second time to come back so maybe you should offer to deliver it or perhaps you make the call to refund me my money since it was due to your incompetence. Never again.",

    "text": "I am really into places like this, so I might be a bit biased. By places like this I mean small, seemingly family owned, authentic, hole-in-the-wall places that give you a \"you came for the food not the atmosphere\" vibe. There is no fluff to this restaurant - the tables and chairs are reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. They don't need to impress you with fancy chairs and decor - though - because they know the food is what will keep you coming back. They started us off with a free bruschetta, and as surprised as I was I was in love with it. If I hadn't wanted to try more for the review I would have ordered an appetizer of them! As it is, I did want more variety and we had the calamari and split a caprese salad. The salad was disappointing but I think it's mostly the presentation. You get several fat slices of mozzarella so I wouldn't say it was small, but it felt small. They should move it to a smaller plate because I think my mind was playing tricks on me - I thought they certainly couldn't be charging eight dollars for that.  However, the calamari was a saving grace. Delicious and deep fried - the only part that confused me was that it came with a sweet chili sauce. The kind I would normally dip lumpia into. It came with regular pizza sauce too, however, and that satisfied me. It was watery and chunky - I prefer others but it wasn't by any means bad. Then the killer - the pizza you waited 45 minutes for!! We got a double pepperoni and I was stuffed after one slice. I wish the crust on the bottom was softer for a deep dish but it was still worth the wait. Reheating this pizza the next day was AMAZING though. It's one of those foods that is better as a leftover.",

It wasn't bad per se it just wasn't good either. A very nice man I met from Chicago that now resides in Vegas and works as Bartender at a popular restaurant recommended this place to me as the best Chicago pizza in town and told me he drives across town to buy pizza here ....Bleh blah if you ask me.  Ive eaten awesome Chicago Deep Dish and an awesome Chicago style thin crust square cut version many times and this over priced mediocrity isn't in the same ball park and both those pizzas btw were in 2 different restaurants in a very small Minnesota town of Winona, MN not even the Windy City itself.  The Deep Dish was too doughy, undercooked not enough cheese, sausage, mushrooms. The Thin crust was just meh...it should of been bursting with flavor! a rich sauce, flavorful spicy pepperoni and sweet succulent pineapple...it had barely any of that flavor profile.  Was it bad?  Truthfully No....the sausage and mushrooms were fine what little there was...nothing horribly wrong with the sauce...I'll just say I won't be spending another 40$ dollars here any time soon, not unless they change their recipe. Recommend to them less bread and much more flavorful ingredients. No complaints on the service.",

    "text": "I am reviewing from my experience from a couple months ago. We were turned off from the get go. There were a few young girls in the front working. 2 girls were bickering at each other in the front. One girl was being so rude to the other employees. We placed a to-go order. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish pizza & wings. While waiting for our wings, one of the girl employees asked another girl (same rude one), \"Are our wings here even good? I haven't tried them...\" The other girl looked at her & nodded her head gesturing no....or even hell no. Just an expression of disgust on her face. It was loud, so I spoke up & mentioned how that sucks they're that nasty cause we just ordered like 20 of them. She rudely said, \"Well I don't like them...\" The other girl tried to cover up for her & said her dad loves them. The wings ended up being \"ok\". The pizza was soaked in tomato sauce to the point the crust tasted like thick raw dough.   Honestly, I just could not get over how bad that girl's attitude was. If you guys are going to hire young girls, you should make sure they are compatible & that none have a nasty attitude. Definitely make sure she does not bash on your food loudly in front of customers! Either she hates her job or was having a very bad day. Regardless, she shouldn't have been acting out like that & making it obvious. I usually don't care & shrug off bad customer service...but this one actually pissed me off. She had an attitude with employees & us. Even if the other girls were nice, I just felt SO annoyed by the experience. I'm sure it played a role in our opinion of the food...I'm surprised I didn't review earlier.  Just got done reading other reviews & many also mentioned the rude girls (maybe the same one). You guys should really fix this or you will continue to lose business. It gives customers a bad taste in their mouth before even trying your food.",

The crust was nice and crunchy and the pizza was ow so filling, even for a big fella 2 slices filled me up. I also ordered the calamari however this a little bit of let down. Small rings and the seasoning was kinda bland. The sauce that came with it though Def helped on the flavor. Nice place to go watch sports on the weekends and is a nice to change up for pizza outside of the chain pizza joints!",

Upon entering we were promptly greeted and seated by a pleasant and attentave staff. We were both surprised at how large of a dinning area this store has. The facility was bright, shinny and clean. A perfect family friendly dinning environment. This store is even more exciting if you are a fan of everything Chicago sports with TV's in sight of all available seating. Our food was delicious and was served hot. They even have a great deal on a full slab of BBQ Baby Back Ribs, $12.95 on Wednesday's. During our dinner they were doing a brisk and steady pick-up and delivery business at the front counter. Service was excellent and my 30% gratuity reflected that. We are looking forward to returning to try other entrees on their menu. I have my eye on one of their thin crust pies.",

It's becoming a family favorite for their large portions and open seating which is perfect for groups, as well as for my big, loud and lovable family! They have wall to wall Chicago themed decor and Flat Screen TV's for all the Sports Enthusiasts too!    We enjoyed their wide selections of pizzas and even waited the grand 45 mins for the signature deep dish! Wish I could say how delicious it was but I was too full from the scrumptious Chicago Hot Dog (with all of the fixings) by the time our pizza came-so to go it was!!   Worthy Mention! The Chicago Hot Dog.  Order it how it comes-no exceptions (you can do without the sport peppers #HEAT) . I think it's the Best \"Chicago\" Hot Dog I've tasted in town yet!   Service was delightful as always! French Fries made it to the table quick, hot and ready for the anxious kiddos at the table. They even provided me with milk for the baby on board!   Overall! Amore is a gem in the Valley that must be Enjoyed!  Go check them out!",

I'm sure most of us think of a thick, layered, pie style of pizza when we hear Chicago pizza, but that's not what you're going to want to order here. Here you'll find the pizza that boasts a thin, cracker like, crust topped with delicious sauce, high quality cheese, and fresh, generously portioned toppings. I'd much rather fill up on more than a few slices of this than burn out after one slice of deep dish.  The bruschetta is as fresh as it gets and the fried mushrooms are the perfect salty bites to go with their house ranch.  Atmosphere is relaxed and family style. Walls are covered with images of every Chicago home team including a special portion of drywall dedicated to Jordan himself.  Best part? They now serve beer!",

    "text": "My wife chose this place for my birthday especially since we're from Chicago. My co-worker said she didn't like this place, she had a italian beef, she thought was awful. I loved the Chicago sports theme all around the restaurant. We had a table of 8 people, the first server offered to split the checks which was needed. They ended up mixing the orders on the check, they took a long time for the food and we had different servers coming to the table so we never knew who was our server. As far as the food, because the wait was starting to get long, they gave us complimentary bruschetta. For an appetizer, we tried the sweet chili shrimp which was really good but it only comes with 4 jumbo shrimp per order for $12.95. My cousin ordered the Buffalo Shrimp, 4 jumbo shrimp the same price. For dinner, I had a personal deep dish pizza which wasn't too bad no complaints. My wife wanted a gyro but requested chicken. It was terrible, the meat wasn't seasoned and the tzatziki sauce was nasty. She was disappointed and stated she doesn't want to come back. My grandfather had the stuffed shells he said they were good. My grandmother had a polish sausage and fries, she was disappointed the fries were a bit cold and polish wasn't too good. Both grandparents said go to Windy City Beefs-N-Dogs, its better. My aunt had a regular gyro, she ate all her food so I guess she liked it, my father in law and his wife had deep dish pizza and my cousin had a polish. I didn't ask them their opinion their food.",

Ribs had nice color to it, sauce just right amd meat tender. I could cut the ribs with a butter knife. Next visit im sure to order a side bbq sauce to dip. Overall, good find fir the buck.

Their thin crust pizzas are \"to die for,\" the sauce tastes fantastic and the cheese is oh so gooey and delicious! I had the lobster ravioli while my folks order an extra large pizza and the ravioli is a \"must-have\" in their menu...fresh tasting lobster and nice made ravioli with your choice of a vodka or Alfredo sauce (Mine was with vodka-orange color sauce with garlic mixed in).   When you walk in, your brought back to all the big moments of Chicago sports, from your tables to the TVs and walls depicting Cubs team World Series photo from 2016, Blackhawks 2013 Stanly Cup team photo, Bulls and Sox as well...as well as figures of all Chicago's sports from Michael Jordan to Bobby Hall and Stan Mikita. Many people from Chicago frequent this place and for good reason-it reminds you of the spectacular city that Chicago is and the food it has to offer. Definitely recommend anyone give this pizzeria a shot, you won't regret it!",

I asked if I could have a glass of water while we waited and was told no.  Water is served only to dine in customers.  What?  We just spent $24 and were going to wait for 25 minutes and couldn't get a glass of water?

    "text": "Have seen the advertising on TV and switched our dinner plans on a whim as we drove by. My wife had the Chicken Angelo,my son had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and I tried the lasagna.  First, the Chicken Angelo--the sauce was bland and unseasoned.  It is supposed to be a white wine and chicken base reduction with lemon.  It was almost tasteless.   2 stars.  The BBQ Chicken sandwich was fine, but there was a mystery side salad (about a cup and a half of chopped lettuce, chopped red onions and 3 tomato slices served without any dressing or dressing choice offered.  French fries portion was generous, crispy and hot..  3 stars.  My lasagna was puzzling.  The waitress indicated there was \"lots of cheese\", but I thought they skimped..  The top layer of cheese was mozzarella, and all the interior cheese was ricotta.  They advertise a meat sauce on the layers, but I had ricotta only, which made the lasagna fairly dry--not moist and gooey, like I am used to.  The lasagna was accompanied by two rather skimpy (I am guessing 2 ounce) meatballs on the side.   I have had, and I also make a whole lot better.  2 stars.  I would recommend doubling the meatballs--the cost would be only about 80-90 cents.  All 3 dishes arrived at the same time, however the consequence of this was that my wife's and son's dishes were piping hot, while my lasagna was just past warm only.    One minor gripe.  When we got the bill after trying to catch the waitress's eye for about 3 or 4 minutes, the plastic folder stated \"We proudly accept American Express Cards\", which my wife put in for payment.  Our waitress took one look and informed us they no longer accept AMEX--handed the bill back and promptly scooted to another part of the restaurant.  Four minutes and 10 seconds later (finally---my chronograph watch does something useful !!l!), she returned to collect the check and credit card.  Another 3 and a half minutes and she returned with the bill for my wife to sign.  She managed to finish the night by hitting one of my pet peeves..  She started clearing the table while my wife was signing and while we were still seated.  After almost 9 min to check out, she couldn't have waited 30 more seconds for us to get up and leave???  I am giving a rare (for me) 2 star rating.",

No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked.   I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)",

Only knock would be no beer/wine.  I love an excellent craft beer with a deep dish pizza.  I was informed this is in the works and soon beer will be served.  The other knock was in between the Chicago sports team decor, there were nice flat screen TVs on the wall which were not operational.  Again, was told this is due to a remodel and soon these TVs will be on.    Service was great and the pizza was delicious.  I will return again while I'm in Las Vegas.

Until I make another trip to Chicago for a pizza pilgrimage, \"The Malnati Classic\" is the only deep dish that future pies will be compared to in my book.   The restaurant is 20 minutes from my neighborhood, so we placed an order for a small, 10-inch deep dish pizza with extra cheese and sausage to be ready for us by the time we arrived -- the toppings chosen were the same as \"The Malnati Classic.\" So how was it? Average at best. Other Yelpers have noted how the sauce has a sweetness; ours was the opposite had a mild acidic flavor. My biggest criticisms were the pizza was served to us warm, and the crust was hard. I hate to say it, but the crust ruined the pizza.   Amore's deep dish may not be comparable to Lou Malnati's, but I would return to try another one of their pies, perhaps a regular thin crust which I've heard is delicious.",

Tonight we had my boyfriend's children in town-- 3 teens (feel sorry for me please). Anyhow, we decide to give this place another shot because everybody wanted Italian and this seemed like a simple order.  we ordered:  1 Eggplant dinner 1 House Salad 1 Deep Dish Pizza with half cheese/ half meatball and sausage 1 Caprese Salad 1 Lasagna  Total was just over $70... plus $8 for delivery and taxes.  We placed the order... then got a confirmation from the restaurant they'd received the order and were preparing it. Not so much... at 8:20pm when the order still hadn't arrived, we reached out to Grubhub which told us the restaurant had a power outage... never received the order and they weren't making or delivering it....   Even though they CONFIRMED the order!!!  If there was a power outage, then how did they confirm the order?! I have no idea what the deal is, but I was willing to give this mediocre pizza joint another chance-- and totally got burned on a $70 order, with an $8 delivery fee, plus tip. My boyfriend and I will be eating turkey sandwiches tonight and the kids will be having cereal and White Castle microwaveable sliders.... as a late dinner. NOT how we intended our take-out night dinner to say the least.  We will NOT be ordering from here again. The fact they confirmed the order, and couldn't bother themselves to call us or grubhub to let us know it wasn't on the way, or even being cooked is EVERYTHING we need to know about this restaurant.",

The fried mozzarella was bomb and they gave us complimentary bruschetta...which was vest I've ever had.  We got a deep dish pizza for dinner that was outstanding,  they cut the pepperoni double thick...which no one else does and the crust was delicious too.   All the servers were really friendly and attentive. The place was packed but we got great service.   I will definitely be back.",

Not a sports bar either, even though there are TV's located all around the area.  Pizza is great and the bruschetta was out of this world.  We also \"sampled\" their homemade sausage in the meat sauce and it was very flavorful.  Will be definitely going back!",

    "text": "Ive been wanting to check out Amore and finally came in for dinner and  tried the deep dish Chicago style pizza.  Parking was no hassle since its located in a large retail  center.    I took the suggestions from other yelpers and called in my order a head of time. The pizza wasn't ready after being seated so I ordered an appetizer of shrimp scampi - served with garlic bread. The shrimps were deveined, whole and yummy. When the pizza arrived I was taken back of the thickness and contained homemade sausage, mushrooms and the chunks of tomatoes that were sweet and delicious. The pizza was packed with quality ingredients and the dough was thick but not overly cooked. I ended picking off of three slices all the ingredients and passed on the ends of the crust.   Overall a positive experience here with friendly waitresses who were service oriented! As for the pizza I'm torn between being fan of regular or deep dish. I guess if both were in front of me I would indulge in either or!",

The pizza was brought to our table in about 15 minutes, very hot, just the way we like it. Crispy crust and the right amount of topping. I like more fennel in the sausage but it was pretty darn good.  Great atmosphere for Chicago fans.  The servers were nice, the place was clean and they have a good menu.

Service: service was great, the waitresses were attentive to our needs since we have 2 young kids this was a definite plus.  Food: been wanting to try deep dish pizza for quite sometime. We do have Giordano's now in vegas but wanted to get a local Chicago recommendation we ended up in amore. We ordered the deep dish pizza and some side orders. Salads, fries and cannelloni. The deep dish pizza was ok remember I don't have a point of reference for the deep dish but this review is based on my own subjective taste. The deep dish was piping hot, and we added pepperoni, bell pappers and mushrooms the cheese was gooey and the dough was thick. We did not enjoy the pizza as much and we might have expected I think we just preferred the thin crust pizza. We might want to try Lou Malnati's in Chicago to convert our preference. The thick dough was chewy and isnt crunchy. It's good pizza but isn't as good as I expected it to be.  Overall : it's good for huge parties , and for hanging out with friends, please don't expect too much from the pizza, the side dishes were good.",

The inside is lined with everything Chicago on the walls from the Cubs to the Bears and you can definitely feel the love from the decor to the food. We were served complimentary bruschetta which had a really nice taste to the tomatoes! The thin crust was really good but the deep dish is what you need in your life. I have never actually enjoyed deep dish pizza but their technique was life changing! Think of a buttery savory dough drenched with fresh tomatoes sauce exploding with flavors of basil and garlic on top. AMAZING. And do not forget to get cannoli's! The flavor of the fillings perfect balance with sweet and ricotta absolutely ruined any other one I've had before and will have in the future. Trust me. Make a trip and get a deep dish.",

One was a personal size deep dish pizza and the other was a polish sausage sandwich, which came with fries. We split both items to share.   Hubby just thought it was alright. He thought the deep dish was better at Rosattis. I liked it. (And so did our son, who had two slices for dinner that night.) I really liked the polish sausage sandwich, which was flavorful, but the bun was quite soft (hubby's complaint). But I think if there was a firmer bread used, then, it would've been to heavy to eat. We had sweet peppers on the sandwich and I added the hot peppers (mmm). The fries were not crispy. Very soft. I think those could've been cooked longer. (Putting them in the air fryer the following night, made them crunchy and better.)   I would like to try other things on the menu, but hubby would probably only give this place three stars.",

    "text": "So my son has been wanting to have a Chicago-Style Deep Dish pizza, so we came here to try it out. It was just amazing! Ordered a 12\" deep dish with pepperoni, Canadian bacon, and jalapenos all of which was delicious! The crust was perfectly cooked no part was doughy and no part was over cooked a perfect golden brown. Easily the best pizza crust I've had in all of Vegas! The medium deep dish can easily feed about three to four adults. I also got a cheesecake which tasted just absolutely amazing. The staff were kind and attentive! Highly recommended will go back soon to try the other menu items!",

    "text": "Another place I've known for quite a few months, and finally checked out recently! I went in a group of 5 and were taken care of immediately.  The bad: After a few minutes of looking through the menu, our waitress asked us if we were ready to order and I asked for a little more time. However, she gave us a bit too much time. For a moment, we all thought we were forgotten about! It was at least 15 minutes until she came back. Also, (not their fault) it was extremely difficult to find parking! We went around 8pm on a Friday and couldn't find parking until we reached this somewhat hidden section in the northeast corner of the plaza.  The good: The place was packed but we were still immediately seated and given our drinks. There is plenty of items to choose from on the menu from sides, sandwiches, pastas, and of course, pizza. I chose the shrimp diablo angel hair pasta and a fried calamari appetizer, and my group got sandwiches and custom pizzas. We got a complimentary appetizer too, which I think was some type of tomato bruschetta. It was delicious! The fried calamari didn't take long at all, and it was nice, crunchy, and fresh. Our main courses arrived shortly after finishing our calamari, and all of it was so scrumptious.   My shrimp diablo was perfect. Our waitress said it was the spiciest thing on the menu, so I was a bit scared, but I'd give it a 5/10 in spiciness. Totally handleable. It was pricy (almost $19), but they do give a lot. My friend had to help me finish it (it also comes with bread and butter. Definitely for those who are sharing or have a large appetite!). And, my friends who got a custom pizza also each enjoyed their concoctions. They loved all the options and possible combinations, and each devoured their pizzas with delight.",

I have been here a few times and have been impressed by the Chicago style pizza. I used to travel to Chicago over a decade ago and always ate some pizza and a dawg. The deep dish pizza here at Amore rivals the tastes in Chicago. I am really not a crust person but I was able to down the crust here. It is that good, in my opinion!  The lunch specials are very good  specially at $7.95! I had the spaghetti and meatballs that came with a soup or salad. I chose the chicken soup which was fantastic. A nice broth with chunks of chicken and vegetables, very nice as a starter. There are other lunch specials on the menu for $7.95 if you are not into spaghetti. :)  The atmosphere is very Chi-Town sports guy vibe, if that makes sense! There are TV's going to watch sports and the restaurant is quite spacious. The service is fast especially during lunch and they are very friendly.  Great pizza, incredible lunch specials and good service. AMORE!",

We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken, the girl taking it, pretty tall girl with beautiful blonde and light brown highlights and low lights was just SO nice and attentive. We thought she was our server, alas, she was not.  The time it took to get our food was not bad at all! What was bad was our actual server, she was possibly in her 30's and had blonde hair, I didn't catch her name, because she literally came to our table one time. She basically ignored us the rest of the time we were there. BUT the first young girl came to our rescue!  Our pizza was amazing, Chicago style cut, it small squares loaded with meats and cheese! SO GOOD! Chicken parm sandwich was DELICIOUS! The one thing that kind of sucked, was the greasy crinkle fries. I was not a fan. The chicken wings were actually pretty solid, not my favorite, but they're were tasty.  This review should have been a 3 maybe 4 stars, but our initial server redeemed everything! She was just so sweet and kind!   Pro tip! Get the pizza cooked well done! SO GOOD!",

As a result, Chicago-style pizzerias have sprouted up around the country, providing Chicagoans with a taste of home, and introducing this unique dining experience to many major cities throughout the United States.\"  We had The Personal Deep Dish, Topped generously with gooey melted cheese, chunky style marinara sauce, and heavily loaded with additional fresh ingredients, and pepperoni. This was an excellent combination.   The deep dish crust is something I can't describe, nothing close to what we normally eat.  So this is what a real pizza is suppose to taste like, Amore's!",

But I need to tell you that I'm a wee bit prejudiced in their favor, as I have known Rick (an owner) for well over 10 years, but I really have enjoyed the many meals he's served there.  I can certainly recommend their Pizza, which is my favorite and the Spaghetti with Meatballs are \"to die for!\"  But, I also love their Lasagna and their Ravioli, as well.  In fact, whenever I stop by, it takes me around a half-hour, just to peruse the menu and make up my mind, because of all the many choices.  You name it and they can prepare it, excellently, too.  There is NO SUCH THING as a \"bad\" meal, at AMORE.  But, the #1 reason I keep coming back (and it's a 20-mile trip, in ONE direction from my home), is because Rick & his staff are BIG on Customer Satisfaction.  They really CARE about their customers, and that's why there is sometimes a LINE outside, with folks patiently waiting to enter.  I don't go there enough, and I'm really gonna have to \"work\" on that.  My advice?  Try the Cannoli.  And, I've been to Italy, where you will NOT find better food, than at Rick's AMORE.",

He says it's the closest beef sandwich in Las Vegas to the ones he had growing up in Chicago. I don't have the experience with that, but I trust he knows what he's talking about as we've searched around town to all the \"Chicago Beef\" places, only to be somewhat disappointed.  Also good to note, ask to have it dipped with the fries wrapped up, I hear it's the most delish way to go with the gravy, the dipped bread and drippings all flavoring up the fries.  For me, the Chicago style hot dog is my favorite! I get extra sport peppers and they happily oblige. Service is always a smiling face, and fast even on a busy night.   The ambiance is very casual, it's not quite a diner, not quite sports bar and the seating feels a bit cafeteria-like but they have upgraded their wall decor of Chicago memorabilia and famous celebrities etc... also several large screens to catch a game on. If you're looking for a relaxed place to find Chicago pizza/sandwiches/dogs this is a good spot.",

The sausage itself was very good as was the au jus but the \"sweet\" peppers weren't really that great or sweet. I'm pretty amazed that this place doesn't have a Chicago dog or any hot dogs for that matter. Can't really call yourself a Chicago eatery without having Chicago dogs. Minus one star for that.

You have the option to pre-order and tell them when you'd like to either pick it up or eat in.   + Had the thin crust instead of the deep dish...Just felt like it. Amazingly fresh and good. Downside was no leftovers.  + Some have complained about the price, but for the quality, I thought it was very reasonable.   + Getting delivery, their minimum order is a very reasonable $10, with a $3 charge. Since my car was in the shop, I had no other options, but I'll be keeping them in rotation for future orders.",

It's a bit pricy for the amount of food you get if you're comparing it to a place in the Chi but for Vegas portions it's plenty of food.  They get thumbs up for the Italian beef sandwich that I got dipped with hot peppers as well. Light on the portions but decent flavor.",

However, every time I walk into that place. It's True. I am in love. Amore Taste of Chicago is by far the closest thing I have to Chicago style food in Las Vegas.   I must admit the first time I went I may have gone a little overboard with my friends (who are Chicago natives)  . We first decided just to get a deep dish pizza and a salad. You know to keep it fresh and light. Then we happened to see they have thin crust pizza. So we got that to.  Oh and maybe a few Chicago style hot dogs.   Get off my back man. We were excited!   Needless to say everything was delicious. You really can't go wrong. However, some people at the table preferred thin crust to deep dish. Things were civil... until a pepperoni was thrown.  As for me, I loved them both. Deep dish, thin crust. I don't care. Amore puts a whole lotta love into all their dishes.               The family atmosphere I believe makes the experience even more wonderful. The place was packed with families wearing their Chicago sports team apparel . Not to mention the staff which makes you feel like you have been going there for years!  Amore Taste of Chicago is by far one of my  favorite places to dig in & I suggest you do  the same!   My Tips:  1) When ordering a deep dish, know that they can take up to 45 min to               make. Trust me its worth the waits.  2) DO NOT walk into Amore's wearing an other sports apparel besides Chicago teams. It's just polite.   DA BEARS",

If you answered yes to all three of those questions, look no further this is the place.   We had that nagging crazing for some pizza at work and we all tend to lean more towards the deep dish side of things so we decided to try this place out. We ordered 2 large Deep dish pizzas for the 6 of us and when we finished we had an entire pizza left, this did not happen because we didn't like it, it happened because this is massive pizza. There is no shortage of meat, cheese and sauce and it is definitely not floating in grease like some other pizzas we have ordered in the past.   I really don't have anything bad to say about the quality of the food or service here. This is a class act in the world of pizza Pies.

I'm a New York thin crust type - so I've eaten at Amore's twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and still think it's one of the best at delivering traditional Italian staples.  Between my friends and I we've had: Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Francese, Homemade Lasagna, Chicken Alfredo and everyone of us would rather eat here than in any other local Italian restaurant. The only disappointment was with an appetizer - the Caprese Salad, which tasted great, but was quite skimpy on the buffalo mozzarella - and who needs cucumbers in a Caprese Salad?  Dinners run $14 - $18. Pizzas start at $9.25 for a small cheese, and go up to $24 for 16\" \"everything\" and specialty combo pizzas/  There are still many dishes I'm looking forward to: surprisingly, Baby Back Ribs are a specialty, and also at a special price on Wednesdays. Chicken Piccata, Marsala, Cacciatore are all favorites of mine too. Portions are large, but the pasta with the meals is a smaller portion now than my first visit. Having said that - it's hard to go home hungry and my friends and I have already decided we'll be going on a regular basis from now on.",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Chicago- style stuffed pizzas, the only reason I hadn't made it out to Amore sooner was the location (far from home in Henderson) and my on and off adherence to low carb diets. On Friday I used my birthday week (yes I said week, LOL) as a caloric excuse and finally made it out to try the best stuffed pizza in our fair city !   Having read Yelp and with a certain degree of familiarity with Chicago style pizzas, I knew to call ahead to make sure I could squeeze Amore into my lunch break and still get in and out of there in under an hour. The lunch specials for $5 looked good, but I had to try the stuffed pie to see if this place lived up to my favorite spots in Chicago. Their large with 2 toppings for $15.99 was well priced (on special?), and was ready within the promised 45 minutes.   I'll start with the service - it was fabulous. Our waitress couldn't have been more nice or helpful. The pie was beautiful and looked like the pies I remember in Chicago. Ok, I'll be blunt. This pie was by far the best I've had in Vegas (as far as Chicago stuffed styles go), but definitely isn't \"just like Chicago\". It's like Steve said - it's a nicotine patch equivalent for Chicago pizza addicts.   For me, the sauce was way too sweet but I realize that's personal preference. The crust while \"bland\" was very True to the style and for me extremely reminiscent of Giordano's . The cheese was extremely gooey and perfect and they didn't skimp on the quantity at all! The toppings were a bit skimpy for my taste (I'd like to see a bit more of them!), but otherwise it was a great pizza.    While this wouldn't be a 5 star joint in Chicago, we are in Vegas after all!  This is the closest most authentic Chicago stuffed style here in town and i look forward to adding this my lunch rotation every once in awhile. The staff was awesome and the price is right.",

It was fine, the most impressive part being the walls filled with Chicago greats and not having to wait for a table at 2:30 PM on a Sunday.  OH and there are several good sized, good quality TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  Which was nice since the US Open was on.    We started with the house salad -- it's not an antipasto or a great house salad at that -- it's ICEBERG lettuce, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes.  Their house Italian is more of a balsamic which I really didn't mind, but the salad was less than impressive.  I am not an iceberg lettuce fan, but luckily my husband is and he finished it off.    Their tomato sauce is a little on the tangy side, which is fine.  My daughter wasn't crazy about it, but I do realize tomato sauce is a personal preference kind of thing.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatball (one big meatball) and was satisfied.  She also ordered garlic bread which was waaaay garlickly - I know, I know, it's supposed to be, but my husband and I could still taste the garlic in our teeth two hours later!!    The pizza . . . . they told us it'd be 45 minutes, but it was actually 25.  Bonus!  Maybe it's because we ordred the homemade sausage, pepperoni and green pepper and didn't stuff it full?  It was good - it wasn't great, not quite like thick, oozing goodness of Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due in Downtown Chicago, but it was still delicious.  The crust wasn't too thick or too doughy which in my book, is a good thing.  If I ever crave deep dish, I would probably, maybe return, but I wouldn't make a special trip to do so.  A note on size, the small is 8 pieces and was more than enough for 2 adults.  The other bummer was . . . . no beer?  No wine?  Beer and pizza make a great meal  in my book!  I was disappointed, truly.",

We had to make it before Lou Malnati's closed. So, yes, I have lusted for deep dish. More recently, I have started to doubt the nutritional smarts of consuming an inch of cheese sitting on top of a buttery crust, but I know it can still be a delicious treat. And, Amore's is indeed just that.   I can't say it is as perfect as Lou's - the sauce borders on too sweet, and the crust doesn't have the perfect buttery crisp chewiness; it is more doughy. However, the overall effect is still a delight to consume. We ordered garlic and sausage, and when mixed with the cheese and fresh, sweet tomato sauce, it was a nice little (or rather deep) symphony of flavors. It also reheats very well. (We made the mistake we always make of ordered a medium, when truly a small will do for 2.)  It definitely takes 45-minutes for them to prepare, so don't come for a quick bite. While waiting we noshed on the fried zucchini, and it too was a nice indulgence. Service was efficient despite their being some sort of restaurant drama unfolding. I loved the fact that Rosie told us straight up, \"Don't get tomatoes,\" when we first suggested that was one of the toppings we wanted. I appreciate honesty in service. It makes for a better meal.   Deep dish!",

Across the way we found this pizza joint where they do Chicago style pies, we ordered the homemade fried mozzarella which was hot and extra cheesy, with marinara sauce to die for!! Then we decided on ordering the deep dish with four toppings the waitress recommended we put pepperoni jalepenos, black olives and Italian sausage which was delicious it has to be my new favorite combonation -the small was PLENTY for two people with a slice left over so no need to spend more than that if you're just dining with a pal.   I will definitely be back to try the cannoli and to eat more pizza",

    "text": "As Chicagoans we are always looking for great pizza. We saw a commercial on TV  for Amore and decided to take drive over before the fireworks. We were nicely greeted and seated right away. The staff was attentive throughout the meal. Atmosphere is like a typical Chicago pizzeria with Chicago memorabilia and photos.  We ordered the bacon cheddar fries which were decent- our pizza was a sausage and mushroom thin crust which came out quickly. The sauce was rather plain and some of the pieces ( corner ) did not have much coverage but overall the taste was good.  Really nice view of the strip if you sit by the window. Price for value was good- they don't serve alcohol so might be better take out if you are a pizza and beer person",

    "text": "It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.    Now I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!  As I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!  UPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said \"I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE.\"  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, \"What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?\"  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!",

After waiting well over an hour and learning of the problem, we switched to RoadRunner and found this restaurant.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan, which comes with a side of spaghetti, and ordered garlic bread as well.  I've always said that if I were on death row, my mom's eggplant parmesan is the last meal I'd want, and this dish reminded me why.  Nicely seasoned, not mushy or undercooked, and very good sauce.  You know that if the sauce is bad, everything is bad! They did a great job.  The pasta was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but again, yummy sauce!  The garlic bread was buttery and nicely seasoned with garlic.    I would definitely order from here again. I'd like to try their pizza.  UPDATE: after ordering from here several times I actually came out here to pick up an order rather than have it delivered. Looked like a comfy place to sit down and enjoy a casual meal. The main thing that got me was the heavenly aroma that took me back to Chicago, where my family used to go to Gino's, famous for their deep dish pizza. Sigh...",

The restaurant has a really nice ambience, tons of Chicago memorabilia over the walls. It makes you feel like you're in the city.   Our waitress Jennifer was awesome, our drink order was immediately taken. Soon after we ordered our appetizers, mozzarella sticks and a side salad, both were delicious. The small side salad was enough for two people to share. We ordered a pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza- amaaaaaaazing. It was so big (even though we ordered a medium) we were stuffed after a couple of slices and had to take it to go. I can go on and on about how great this place was but the best advice I can give is try it out. You will NOT be disappointed!",

Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!  I ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).  The food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG...</a> The Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.  Next up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10\" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.  Overall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.  I can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!  Return Factor - 100%",

The cheese was the kind that just stretches off the slice. The flavor of the sauce and crust was Terrific! Sauce had a wonderful texture and garlic taste. The white pizza was light and fresh spinach with artichoke and drizzled with olive oil and cheese.  Oh and how could I forget to mention the ravioli rolls? OMG! Soooo good!      WE ORDERD TAKE OUT FROM HERE A FEW DAYS AGO.  It was piping HOT when my husband got it home! Still just as good as eating in.  Our server was great. Never an empty glass.

Awesome! So I was beginning to call the restaurant to inform them of their error when suddenly the phone rings...its Amore. I was thinking \"oh they must have left the white pizza on the counter and boxed up the wrong one\" but to my dismay, they are calling to request my credit card number again because they mistyped it into the computer! So I took that chance to explain the pizza situation to them and I was presented with two options...they can come out and replace the pizza (which will take a considerable amount of time...more than an hour) or I can receive an $8 credit of the difference for next time. They told me they could not void out the previous order and charge me the correct amount,therefore stealing my money by forcing me to make an additional purchase to receive my money owed. This was definitely a one-star experience, but I must give 2 stars on account of the quality of the pizza which was delicious. If they can make things right I'd be willing to update the review later, but I need to see improvement in your attention to detail and way in which you handle your errors.",

We were gravitating towards a white pizza, but the lady helping us sold us on how good the deep dish is that we decided we can wait the 45 minutes for one (if you know that's what you want- call it in and drive on over there so you're not sitting there forever) , talk and nosh on a app.   She told us about different specials not on the menu so we took up the special large deepdish with 2 toppings at $15 and some change instead of it's normal price (I believe about $22). We got ours with spinach and beef....think of it like a pizza lasagna!  If your server doesn't tell you ask specials- ask because she named off a few.   The BF was feeling the fried zucchini ($6.95) for our app and I like that it was thin slices so you get a lot of crumb crust. I normally dip in ranch, but that marinara was off the hook so fo'getta abou' ranch! Our server brought us hot bread and though I love me some balsamic and oil, I sopped the rest of the marinara up.   Once it came, I was so hungry, yet I only ate 1 and 1/4 a slice. It hits like a brick! The crust is consistently crunchy throughout and the fillings are all quality.   We heard our lady chatting with the table behind me and they were talking about Chicago and where they grew up to see if they were neighbors or something so you know that they're definitely legit people here too. She was very sweet, checked on us often and we never had to ask for a drink refill.  I'm not much for a pizza person, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely I think if I have a hankering for pizza again, I'll keep this place on the short list!",

    "text": "Based upon some prior reviews I wasn't expecting much but we were impressed! I'll preface this review with the fact my tastes trend more toward high end restaurants. No frills here but we were all blown away by the reasonable menu prices as well as the quality of the food and service.   I split a small caesar salad. Plenty for two. My celiac husband requested no croutons and extra care taken with his food prep. The salad was light with a nice classic dressing. They passed the first major hurdle it was not overly dressed.   Several people had the ribs, others deep dish pizza. All were happy. My chicken piccata was perfect with three large slices of chicken breast and a side of penne. When ordering our server asked if I had ever had that dish before because it was very lemony. I assured her that I had and enjoy it. My husband loved his gluten free pizza.  Amore will be added to our regular \"locals\" rotation. Thanks Amore!",

And, the chicken piccata, pounded thin with a light caper lemon sauce.  The amount of food you receive is more than plentiful.   We generally take half home for the next days lunch.  They also give you a complimentary brushetta appetizer while you wait for your food.  Service is spot on.  And if you are a Chicago sports fan, you'll be in heaven with all the sports memorabilia!",

    "text": "Excellent Chicago style deep dish, this far into the Southwest.  We were visiting Las Vegas as a birthday trip for my husband, who spent a lot of his formative years in Chicago, eating at the original Due's.  The only thing close we can get in our little corner of Arizona is the pizza we make at home.  And I haven't perfected the crust yet.  The pictures in Yelp looked right (sauce on top, depth of crust, etc) so we decided to give it a try despite some mixed reviews on service.  We ordered via GrubHub, because that's actually what the Amore website recommended.  Staying at the MGM grand, pretty far from the restaurant, they delivered for a reasonable fee and got the order perfectly right.    We included our floor and room number, and the delivery guy arrived promptly (well, the deep dish takes 45 mins to make so he arrived when expected, with delivery time after that).  He brought the pizza directly to our room without any delays calling or trying to find us.  Our only small complaint is that they did not bring any forks or plates and it was a little hard to eat without them.  Grubhub actually has a spot to select NOT bringing those things, so we didn't think to request them.  All in all, the pepperoni and in-house sausage was excellent.  The sausage definitely tasted premium, and you could believe it was homemade.   The crust was buttery and well-cooked, but was a little harder at the edges than we'd like by the time we sat down to eat.  I'm sure it would have been better eating in the restaurant, but I think that's always True of delivery.   I got the cannoli because, as an Italian American, I miss them.  We don't get them in the southwest made the \"right way\" very often.  And this was definitely excellent homemade cannoli.  The only ones I've gotten recently have been previously frozen, and the pastry is not as crisp and delicate as the ones Amore makes.  This was the perfect pastry, the filling was not too sweet, and the dusting of powdered sugar perfectly tied the two together.  I'm impressed.  I didn't have nearly the trouble with service as some other reviewers, in fact I actually called the restaurant to ask what the most efficient way to get the pizza from the delivery guy would be (if he wanted me to come down to the lobby, i would have) and the nice girl who answered assured me with the room number I provided, he'd find me.  I was skeptical, I mean after all the lukewarm reviews, was he really going to find my room?  He did.  he didn't need to call, he was quick and courteous... and we were able to dig in.",

I should have known better than to take the advice of someone from Iowa.  The fried calamari had a ton of batter on, so much that it was crunchy.  Not good.  The Italian Beef was bland, nothing like the Italian Beef sandwiches in Chicago.  And the deep dish pizza certainly wasn't Uno's, or even Lou Malnatis.  If you're looking for Chicago food, I wouldn't go here.",

    "text": "I had about the worst service here that I've ever experience in not just Las Vegas, but anywhere. If I could give this a negative star I would, but one star is all I'm allowed to score it.  I called ahead to make a reservation for six people, and two medium pizzas. Two of which cancelled and I called back 6 to 8 minutes later after I had placed the order to try and change the order to just one pizza. The girl that took the call didn't tell me her name, didn't ask what I had ordered, what name the order was for, nothing. She just said,\" The pizzas where already in the oven, sorry.\" And she went to hang up the phone, but so content was she in her blatant lie, that she missed placed the phone and left me still on the other end.  Now normally I'd have just hung up the phone but since she so obviously lied I decided to listen in, as I could still hear her talking. She started to speak to her co-worker and I quote said, \" I can't believe how um like fucking stupid people are, calling a few minutes later to change there order.\" \"Haha, I know right.\" \"I just told him the pizzas were already in the oven.\"  This is what I heard on the line, before I hung up.  After I drove to the place(mind you I live 20-25 minutes away) I confronted the receptionist about what had transpired, with the manager standing next to me, I explained calmly what I had happened. She denied it and said another receptionist had taken the call. Which her co worker than took credit for and said she was the one that took the order. But also denied it. The manager looked at me and said, \"Was this the same tone I heard over the phone?\" referring to the employee standing before.  No apology from the manager, no offer, nothing. I just couldn't believe it. The girl then said, sorry that you had an unpleasant experience, or something along those lines. I was to angry to give a shit anymore.  I sat down to tell my friends what happened. As we told the server we wont be eating here after the way I was treated, she said and I quote, \"Well what was said wasn't directed at him but you're free to leave.\" And here I was feeling sorry for leaving the server with one less table. Wow.  Extremely horrible service STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. DO NOT EAT HERE.",

The spinach side was inedible!  They clearly use chopped frozen spinach (based on the olive green color and awful taste) and worse they don't seem to drain it at all.  The watery spinach changed the texture of the crust and the cheese and I couldn't take more than two bites even after scooping (yes, scooping!) the watery spinach from under the cheese.  They get two stars because at least the sausage side was somewhat good.",

    "text": "The two stars are for lack of communication and in no way reflect on the fabulous food, that would be a five star. We have been customers since you opened and this review is for the OWNERS INFORMATION.A Co-worker gave my husband a $25 GIft Certificate and last night after a very busy day, we decided to use it. I called and ordered our usual to be delivered. The order taker did not identify herself and right away,I knew she was a newbie as she did not follow the standard protocol that you use for ordering. She asked card or cash and I said GC and cash. She said okay and gave me the total. Thirty minutes later it was at our door and I paid GC and cash as I HAVE DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE. We were just opening the order when the driver knocked on our door and said we don't take GC for delivery. Since when? Not his fault, so luckily, I had $25 in cash and gave it to the driver. What if I didn't have $25 in cash? Does the driver have a CC machine in his car?  Since this has never happened, I called and asked to speak to the manager. Someone got on the phone, also not identifying herself and went into this long story about the order taker being new and not knowing about GC and that when the manager heard her say GC, she immediately told her to call us back and tell us they couldn't take the GC. I replied we never received that call. The manager says, she must have called the wrong number! Hmmmmmm, if that is the case, why send out the order right away? She told me that it has always been the policy to only take GC dine in. No where on the GC or Menu is that stated. She kept saying she was sorry, not very convincingly, but offered no solution or anything to make a long time customer smile. She just wanted me off the phone. She said she would inform the owner, as I doubt that, that is the reason for the review. I have 35 years of experience in Customer Service in Retail and Food service. The manager needs extensive training on how to handle a complaint. I was easy, as I have been in her place, I never raised my voice or used inappropriate language. She did not listen to me or offer a solution. She should not have put a new person on the phone that was not properly trained without a trained person at her side and on a Friday night. This was order:7 on 9/11/2015 at 5:01PM. I will not post the name of the order taker as she is not to blame for lack of training and lack of communication from your establishment. For that reason, we are disappointed, but will return as Chicagoans, you have the best Chicago Pizza in Vegas!",

Then I saw the sign for this place and asked my wife if she wanted to try something new. She agreed and we ended up here. I had high expectations since the last time I had Chicago deep dish was at a renowned establishment in Chicago's east end. So that is the standard I compared this place to. In the end, I must say I am impressed. I can't say it completely measured up, but it was great nonetheless. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the service was very good. I would recommend calling ahead if you plan to get a deep dish. They take 35 minutes to cook. So this place offers a call ahead service and you pie will be ready when you get there. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Took my husband to Vegas for a surprise 60th, and since deep dish pizza is his favorite meal, checked out the pizza places online and Amore sounded like a good choice. And it didn't let us down. :-) We had the deep dish cheese with extra cheese, and we should have paid attention to the number of people it serves. We ordered a large, because we love pizza, and could only finish about a quarter of it. The thing must have weighed 10 pounds! A very dangerous meal, since you know you should stop eating it, but it tastes so good you just have to have another bite,and another, and another...you get the picture. :-)  Since it was an estimated 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, we decided to have an appetizer. That was the first mistake of our visit. We had the eight piece serving of fried mozzarella triangles. The mistake was not because the mozzarella triangles were not good, they were very good, but they took up more space in the tummy that the pizza could've filled.   All leftovers were nicely packed up in containers for us to bring back to the hotel. Good thing we had a refrigerator in the room :-)   The restaurant has a sports atmosphere, clean tables, a lot of sports pictures around the room. Very 50s diner type atmosphere :-)  We were staying on the strip, so I would recommend visiting Amore if you're renting a car. We actually rented a car for a day (5/1/14) just to make the trip to Amore. The cab fare alone would have been more than the car rental, and that's not including the tip. (According to a web site that estimates cab fares, it was a $60 round trip fare from the Mirage hotel.) Will definitely do it again on our next visit back to Vegas :-)",

We have had no luck until we decided to try this place.  Their large cheese pizza, extra well done with extra sauce tastes just like the pizza we love from back home.  It is just the right amount of thin (not too thin like NY Style) but not too think like regular pizza.  Also they cut the pizza into squares like the neighborhood joints do.  The best.  The pizza is slightly more expensive than it should be.  For example, we could get a 18\" pizza with 3 toppings for $16.00 from the north side of Chicago.  Not sure why this is a little more expensive.  But overall, best Chicago style pizza I've had in Las Vegas.  If it weren't so far from my home, I'd go again.",

    "text": "Move over no name pizza. The new king of pizza in Vegas is Amore!  After stumbling upon one of their ads in the local paper, I immediately drove out and had to try this pizza which looked so delicious. My roommate and I ordered the deep dish pepperoni, and the mozzarella \"sticks.\"   The fried mozzarella was something I've never had before, and was blown away by it. Not your average run of the mill fried mozzarella. It is fried to perfection, and the sweet marinara compliments the rich taste perfectly.  Now the pizza, since that first time, I've been to Amore a half dozen times more. It's that good! I thought it was on the expensive side, but I quickly realize it is well worth it. The sauce is sweet just how I like it, you can just taste the freshness of the crushed tomatoes. The amount of cheese is perfect, not overbearing. But the main attraction for me is the crust. It is soft, buttery, flaky goodness. When you bite into it, the flavors just explodes in your mouth. The food is so good I'm catatonic after every meal at Amores!   I'm salivating as I type this review. Go to Amores!",

    "text": "I love Amores. It's our typical Friday night dinner. We are from Chicago and this is the closest thing to \"neighborhood\" pizza.  True Chicagoans don't like deep dish. That's for the tourists.   Amores thin crust is excellent. 9/10 times we are very happy. Every once in a while the main cook must be sick because we end up with a pizza with a shitty, soggy flavorless crust. That does not happen often but when it does I want to cry. On Amore nights lunch is skipped in preparation and anticipation of that excellent pizza. When you get a bad one its heartbreaking.",

The pizza (thin) is just average...fries with bacon tasty...expected more from their TV advertising...",

I'm probably too used to NY style thin crust pizza...where the super thick Chicago style crust just filled me up like a blimp.

So first we always get the sampler platter and they allow me to sub the zucchini for toasted ravioli, now the waitress when we ordered cut me off in mid sentence of me asking to swap them out that it's \"not allowed\". So I ordered something else. The next issue was mid way through the appetizer my husband needed a refill our waitress was not paying attention to us. Another server comes and brings our pizza and is gone before I can clear my mouth of food to ask for a refill Even though she should of noticed I give it 5 mins and finally take his glass to the front where when she saw me coming she hurried to me I ask for root beer and she brings the cup back now not once does she apologize for me having to come to her for a refill she goes back to chatting with another waitress. We also noticed at the end of our meal the waitress never brought out the complementary bread with the tomato topping To us but the other tables had them and we normally get them. I had to flag down another waitress to have out leftovers put in a box. Not once were we asked how or meal was or nothing. This is not the type of service we are use to when we dine here, out waitress was not friendly and would rather socialize than do what she is being paid to do. I love their food but I refuse to spend my money in a place with poor service.",

To start, I called and made a reservation and was told that I most likely wouldn't need one but they offered a friendly vibe and was actually interested in knowing what the occasion was. They did let me reserve a table and this was on a holiday too. 7/4  My date dug the Chicago atmosphere but the food choices did not remind her of home. In fairness neither of us ordered the pizza or hot dogs so I can't really comment on the Chicago accuracy. What we did order was good though. We had fun, thanks for your help with my date!",

Have to admit though, I usually just get the same thing and it's mostly delivery but it's always 5 star.  I do pepperoni, mushroom, onion & fresh garlic deep dish and it's delish. -the sauce really makes it, taste like san marzano.   I've had chicken wings and zucchini fritt from them, all good but the deep dish is the reason I keep coming back.  I go to another place for New York style and they answer phone and take your order in the way a typical New Yorker would (if you know what I mean); the girls that answer the phone here are always so nice and polite that even if they told you some insanely long wait time, you really wouldn't mind.",

The cashier was polite when taking my order over the phone. She also helped me because I couldn't find a list of the lunch specials online. I have since added a picture of the specials to their yelp listing but I think the prices have gone up from when they printed it. I paid about a dollar more.  The sandwich was huge. It had 3 large meatballs, a large serving of fries, and an extra side of the sauce. The bread had a great crunch to it in the typical french baguette style. The fries were cooked and salted well. The meatballs seemed under cooked They weren't raw by any means but they could have benefited from cooking another few minutes. They seemed limp. I also wasn't crazy about the sauce. It seemed very watery. I may give this place another try at some point because of how close they are to my house but it's nothing I'll go out of my way for.",

Best part, all made to order, be ready to wait 45minutes or call your fine in order ahead of time and show up when your pizza is ready!

That said, the crust is not perfect (needs more cornmeal on the bottom of the thin), but the sauce & other ingredients are spot on.  Service was efficient and friendly. Restaurant atmosphere is so so. Too bright, & over the top. Not \"warm\" & inviting. Kinda like cafeteria style, with a lot of Chicago memorabilia crap strewn on the walls. Sadly, they didnt even have a Sox game on this night that was scheduled on the many TVs, because they dont pay for the blackout service! Come on! You're a Chicago place! Pop for all the full sports packages to get all the  Chicago games! They said they won't get all the Bears games this fall either.....booooooo.....clearly not a \" True\" Chicago place! Anyway, I digress. Prices are rather high; thin crust pizza runs 23.00, ( largest thin crust with one ingredient),  same pizza in Chicago is probably, 14.00 (at Vito & Nicks anyway).   Furthermore, they miss on the Italian beef sandwich.  I don't think it's authentic Gonella bread, or the same kind of Chicago beef, & the gravy (dipped au jus), was very bland. The giardinare was terrible. I will go back for the pizza for sure, but order ahead to avoid the long wait for the pan pie. Or better yet, order in for delivery.",

Few customer that appears to dine in 5 to 10 mins right after us has gotten their food before us. I was getting impatient and frustrated that 45 mins has pass and no appetizer has shown up or our main dish. Close to an hour, our small deep dish pizza has finally arrive. It looks tasty at first but after my first bite, the pizza had no taste and the crust was bland. I was still surprise that our appetizer has not shown up yet. I was very dissapointed and wanted out right away. Got my check and to go box and realize our appetizer was not put in our order. So overall, an hour wait plus a 20 dollar small crap deep dish pizza. I would never return here again.",

    "text": "I took my family here for the first time tonight but this is now my favorite pizza in Vegas.  4.5 stars.  After a recent trip to Chicago I have had deep dish pizza on the brain.  Based off of another yelp review saying Amore has the best deep dish in Vegas I decided to give it a try.    14\" deep dish sausage The crust was was what I was expecting, crispy up the sides with that slight fry on the bottom - delicious!  The sausage has a nice taste, not to heavily spiced but enough so you know it is there.  The cheese was good, the sauce was a little too \"fresh\" for me, I like a heavier darker red sauce.  If you know what i mean.  Pizza was huge, a lot of food and we took half of it home.  Tomorrow's breakfast.  We ordered fried ravioli and fried mozzarella (huge portion).  They brought us a sample of bruschetta which was packed with flavor.  My wife ordered the Shirmp Diablo, requested it to be mildly spiced and was happy with her meal.  The service was great!  Our drink order was taken as we sat down and promptly refilled as needed.  We dropped a knife.  One of the servers heard it hit the floor and was on the way with a set of silverware before we even had a chance to ask.  Food came out as it was ready, the wait staff worked as a team delivering food to tables that were not their own.  Our server was very enthusiastic about the food.  I had the impression that she was a big fan of the food she was serving and not just there waiting on tables.  Deep dish takes a while to cook and our server told us it would take 45 minutes.  She gave us a menu and told us to phone ahead next time, they will get the pizza going and save a table for us.  I am looking forward to trying the Italian beef and sausage combo!",

My reason for not loving the pizza is probably the same reason that makes this pizza so fabulous for almost everyone else...cheese. Amore's pizzas are absolutely loaded, dripping, oozing with hot, gooey cheese.  Which apparently is only an issue for me. I prefer my pie with tons of crushed tomatoes, lots of yummy veggies and very lightly sprinkled with just a smidgen of mozzarella. I know that I'm in the minority here so when my group of six suggested a trip to this eatery I happily went along for the company and the beer, which, much to my dismay, they don't serve. Frown.  The view from here is amazing. The entire front wall of this restaurant is one giant window with an unobstructed view of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip. The decor is pretty cool as well. The walls are over-crowded with photographs from cityscapes to movie stars and athletes. They have a really nice panorama of the Chicago skyline right when you walk in the front door. It's an overall inviting atmosphere thanks to the decor and the staff. We were greeted and seated immediately upon walking in and were very well taken care of throughout the meal. We sat around talking for a good bit after the meal and bill were taken care of and the waitress still kept checking on us periodically. She even brought out a large platter with a generous potion of zeppoles (fried dough strips) for dessert on the house. They were fresh from the fryer and topped with powdered sugar and a drizzle of honey. Very nice finishing touch.",

With an over abundance of bread, the filling flavor was lost. Additionally, the pizza crust was crispier than one remembers a Chicago pizza having.    As for the shrimp scampi appetizer, 4 shrimp and bread in sauce is what I got. Knowing this was my first time in and with minimal appetizer description, I'd have liked the waitress to clarify this was what I was getting, unfortunately she wasn't the most astute and I wasn't on it either.  I tried ordering a side of pasta to go with my 4 shrimp and sauce but was told I couldn't order but a large plate of pasta to go with my appetizer. Hmmm... Overall, the flavor was okay. It wasn't great but it also wasn't completely off. I'd recommend you give it a shot and see for yourself.",

They always tell me that the wait time will be 45 minutes, but it ends up being about 25-30 minutes. The one thing that annoys me about the employees who take the phone orders is that they never tell me what my total is before asking for my payment. Seriously! I give them my order. Then they ask, \"How will you be paying? Cash or Credit Card?\" I ALWAYS have to ask them, \"Uh, what is my total?\" I mean that is common sense, right? They should always tell their customers what their total is BEFORE asking for payment!!  I haven't tried too many items on their menu, but this is what I like so far:  -BBQ Baby Back Ribs: I have definitely had better, but these ribs were still pretty good. I usually get this if I am really hungry since it also comes with beans, fries and cornbread.   -Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza: full of flavor and very filling for a thin crust pizza.  -Deep Dish Pizza (with Pepperoni, Sausage and Olives): Our party ordered this earlier this week and it was the first time I had actually dined in the restaurant. I rarely eat Deep Dish Pizza, but this was pretty good and made me full very fast! They cut the slices so big that I was full after eating just one slice!  What I didn't like:  -Homemade Fried Mozzarella: not sure how to explain this one. I guess I was expecting it to taste like the Mozzarella Sticks you would normally order from other restaurants, but it tasted funny.  -All the Pasta dishes I have tried: maybe it was because I ordered it for delivery or on bad days. Their cream sauce for the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was too thick and lacked taste. I also felt that their marinara sauce was a bit too sweet.   Prices are kind of high, but overall the food is pretty good.",

I ordered a salad to start and that was honestly lackluster but when the pizza came (a deep dish with pepperoni, mushrooms and tomatoes, I was immediately a fan.   The person I was with ordered a dessert that she wasn't too happy with but that's not why you come here. If you're looking for really good deep-dish in Vegas, this is the place!",

Expect mediocre service and waitresses who care more about eating their ice cream than taking your order..... Let alone the right order. The first time around we had to ask for refills on drinks and waited around to get our check processed while they were busy talking amongst themselves. We were the only people in the restaurant and we had to ask to be served. Doesn't make much sense to me.   This time around I gave them a second shot. Their spaghetti and meatball lunch special was yummy like the first time around but the thin crust pizza was good but not that good. We ordered pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage and ended up with pepperoni, mushrooms, and a massive amount of onions. The onions made the rest of the pizza taste like Dominos ( the boyfriend said this ). He really wanted to try their home made sausage on the pizza so we are still waiting. Other than that, the service was still lacking even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. I would be disappointed but fool me once shame on you......fool me twice shame on me.   As far as recommending this place.... I would say make sure you come when a good waiter/waitress is here. I wouldn't know if they have one. But the food is worth it just as long as you want waitresses who is concerned more with their ice cream as your food dies in the window. /harsh. I know.",

Yes it's a bit filling, but it's deep dish.. and yes it's about a 45 minute wait time, but it's worth the wait. We haven't had any other pizza like it. The tomato sauce and tomatoes are so zesty and fresh. We usually get it when we have family in town or friends over because there's so much and it's a no-fail pizza for guests. It makes great leftovers if it's oven-warmed. He prefers carry-out, though we've dined in before. We'll have to try the mozzarella sticks the next time we decide to get a table if it's not too crowded.",

Plus, the place is always filled with actual Chicago natives....so you know it's the real deal!  I've had both the deep dish and the thin crust, and they nailed 'em both!  The atmosphere is very lively and relaxed.  You'll even find the owner mingling with the guests and chatting about back home.  I recommend this place to everyone.

Please - really, please - the grown ups are talking; just be quiet now and go back to your normal hang at Papa John's.  Seriously, though, this is the best Chicago style pizza I have found in Vegas; and, the price is exceptionally reasonable for what you're getting.  The only thing I can think of to ding them about is that the seats might be a little comfier since you'll be spending some time in them (as proper Chicago pizza takes time to prepare).  With that said, the service was attentive and friendly and the pizza (a large stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions) was through-and-through delicious.",

I have been craving Chicago pizza since I moved away 2yrs ago not only did I love my lunch but I ordered 3 more pizza's to take home to California so I could freeze it and eat it later. My whole car smelled like sausage the whole way home and I was so happy as memories of driving home with my Dad on a Saturday night with the bottom of the pizza burning my lap. I can't wait to go back if you miss or want to experience REAL Chicago food without going to Chicago I Defiantly recommend this place.",

Nice TV's so if you are dining alone, you have something to enjoy while dining. The Cheesy Garlic bread was delicious, could have been hotter, maybe it sat up there a few too many minutes before it was brought to my table. The cheese Ravioli was great, definitely not a lack of sauce on this dish. However, the server should have told me it would be $2.95 to have Alfredo Sauce versus Marinara. I didn't even know until the bill arrived that there was an up charge for that request. It should also be on the menu, under the item. Showing comes with Marinara, but if you want another option it will be $2.95. That would be helpful! The menu prices were just right, not too pricey. Love the fact that you get free refills on sodas. The place was clean, the temperature was perfect and the whole dining experience was really nice.....) I will definitely go back! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!",

    "text": "It's been awhile since my first experience here and I didn't want to write an angry review right away in all caps, so after a cooling off period here it goes...  I had been eagerly waiting to try their deep dish pizza since I previously lived really close by and wanted to establish my \"go to\" Vegas pizza spot. I called ahead for pick-up and was told my deep dish pizza would take 45 minutes - no problem, good things take time. I came to pick up my pizza and headed home. Granted, this is my fault for not looking at the pizza first, but once I got home, I realized they had given me a regular pizza, not the deep dish. I called back to let them know of their error, and the girl that answered was super apologetic and placed me on hold so she could get someone to remedy this situation. Instead of being helpful, the guy who picked up the phone basically told me I was in the wrong and there was no way they could have made a mistake and that I did not order the deep dish. I fired back with... if I didn't order deep dish, why did you tell me it would be a 45-minute wait for my food? That kind of quieted him down and he tried to back peddle and say although it wasn't their fault, they could make me another pizza. I didn't want to wait or have to be subject to in-person ridicule after driving back, so I said I would pass, but I wanted to make them aware of the issue. He rudely hung up. Granted, the pizza we did have was good and my husband really enjoyed the oily-ness of it all. For me, I can't support a place that accuses customers of wrongdoing so quickly and doesn't try to remedy the situation in a polite manner, so I won't be back. As Ty W. points out in his review though, it's probably worth at least one visit out here, buyer beware.",

My boyfriend's dish had such a small amount of pasta, which is confusing since that is the cheapest item on the dish.  We never once were offered refills, which if they were busy with guests I would have forgotten about it. They weren't though, the servers were busy chatting with each other at another table. I really was looking forward to dessert since today was my boyfriends birthday, but once again the server was just not interested in guest interaction. Our server dropped off our leftovers without saying anything followed by the check a moment later.  Would I go back? Yes, to see if it was an off day.",

Anyway, we got there right when it opened, she had to unlock the door for us. She offered us to sit anywhere we like and I chose the window side with the Planet Hollywood table. (Each table has a different photo of the Las Vegas strip... It's thuper cute!) I love the decor inside, different sports memories plastered on the walls.   She got our drinks quickly, took our order and the food came out shortly after that. It's important when you only have an hour for lunch. My coworkers each had a sandwich and I chose the stuffed shells.(sadly I was so hungry I didn't get a picture :) There were 4 decent sized shells covered in sauce and LOTS of melted cheese. It also came with a side of bread which was slightly crunchy on the outside and thuper soft on the inside. ---very important! I woofed down 3 shells and most of my bread in a matter of minutes. That means it was delicious and no, nobody was trying to take my food away.   Overall we had an amazing lunch and I can't wait to come back with the hubby this time. I know he was bummed I went without him. :/",

    "text": "Parents went to this place.  Elderly father, disabled mother in wheelchair and her caregiver.  Being on fixed income, they asked for the lunch special which was spaghetti and meat sauce.  When giving their order, they asked the waitress (who also happens to be the manager) if they could substitute angel hair pasta for the spaghetti pasta.  The waitress said yes, no problem and that was that.  Well when the check came, it was very expensive.  Instead of the $7.95 lunch special, they were charged $12.50 per plate.  Needless to say, my parents were upset.  Good restaurant practice is to inform patrons if there is an up charge for substitutions.  She could have easily mentioned that at the time of ordering.  They argued back and forth for a while when the waitress/manager said she was going to call the police.  Again, we are talking about an elderly man, an elderly paralyzed wheelchair bound woman and her caregiver.  My father agreed that the police should be called but then the waitress/manager decided to just ask them to leave, not have them pay for the lunch and ordered them never to return.  This was handed HORRIBLY by the manager.  For less than $10 difference in bill, the manager lost 3 regular customers plus myself and my husband.  Would it have killed her to let them have the lunch at the $7.95 price?  The restaurant would have gotten paid for the food already eaten plus kept things civil and ensured repeat business.  I won't eat at a restaurant that treats elderly and disabled people in such a way, no matter what the food tastes like.",

I got Alfredo and gnocchi's and it was the best I've had in all of Vegas! My boyfriend got the Chicago style pizza and as the restaurant states \"taste of Chicago\" he enjoyed it very much however he felt that the crust of the pizza was a bit over cooked and was hard on the bottom of the pizza. When the server took our orders she stated that the Chicago pizza would take 35 minutes just a tip for others to know if you are in a time crunch! This restaurant offers Pepsi products now I'm a Coca-Cola lover so if you are too they offer Coca-Coke in cans! This is definitely a place to bring your family of all ages. Would definitely recommend everyone to give this place a try you won't be sorry!",

The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.  After ordering a \"1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza\" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered \"Cheesy Garlic Bread\" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting!   Now let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said.   Out front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available.",

I would order their pizza again.",

I ordered a stuffed large pizza with pepperoni and beef. I received it relatively quickly and it looked delicious. When I took my first bite the \"sauce\" was over powering and honestly horrible tasting. I ended up scraping off what looked like nothing but smushed tomatoes and ate my piece without the nasty sauce like substance. The pizza had ZERO flavor. The beef wasn't seasoned and the pepperoni was sparingly spread on top of the pizza. I ended up throwing the rest of the pizza out. It was the worst pizza I have had to date and I've had some pretty shady pizza places. This place does a disservice to Chicago style pizza! Will not order from here again unless the product quality increases dramatically!!",

    "text": "Amazing! That's the word I would use for their food. This seemingly small pizza place has great pizzas. I've never had Chicago style pizza, but Amore has definitely made me consider learning more about the dish. We got a small with mushrooms and ham, and it was divine. For a party of two, we struggled finishing the small because it was so filling. The crust tasted amazing, though a little soggy on the bottom. Not sure if that's just the style, but it was a little off putting. The sauce they used was a simple red sauce but it was so meaty and filling. The one thing I do have to say though is the wait time. The food took forever to get served. I understand that it was fresh and made to order and all, but my goodness, it took like 40 to 45 minutes until we got the small pizza. And it seemed like that was the norm because every other table also got theirs late. Was the food worth wait? Maybe, so I would consider coming back, but maybe for to go. That being said, the service was really good. The servers were attentive and engaging, probably because they're used to having their customers wait forever.",

You want to eat it fresh, especially if you live on the other side of town and you get caught in traffic.   Customer service is personable. A huge plus in my book.   I LOVE the decor here. It definitely gives it that authentic Chicago feel.  TIP: If you're getting a deep dish, get it loaded with toppings. 1-2 toppings doesn't do it justice.  2017 Yelp Challenge Review #7",

But I would also say that the crust wasn't as fresh tasting as I would like it to be, and the fried ravioli were a bit of a letdown. Ultimately, it's 3.5 on the food, but I think the prices are a bit much considering the product. So, on that basis, I am dropping them down to 3. It's certainly far from the worst pizza place around, and you can have a satisfactory meal there.  EDIT: Having had an allergic reaction, I believe it is likely that their pizza crust and/or their ravioli have thiamine mononitrate, which is a sign that they are not using fresh or high-quality ingredients. Particularly for that price point, this is unacceptable. So, I am docking them a star.",

    "text": "LEGIT!  I had my reservations.  A REAL Chicago restaurant...in a North Vegas strip mall?  This place is so nondescript that you'd miss it if you didn't know what to look for.      Once inside you're greeting by a bright, glossy, red vinyl expanse with numerous, large pictures of Chicago icons on the walls.  Frankly, I thought it was a little tacky, but it was kitschy.  Now the important stuff: The food.  Ho-Lee-Crap!  That was the best Italian Beef Sandwich that I've had outside of Chicago.  The pickled peppers/veggies were the real deal.    OMG, OMG.....I don't care that the place is in a weird strip, mall, I don't care that there is a ridonkulous amount of red vinyl.  I would fly to Vegas just to eat here again.   P.S. As we were leaving a big, tall, black dude, walked in the front door, looked around suspiciously and loudly inquired, \"what'd you all know about Chicago?\", in a native Chicago accent.  My mom replied, in her Chicago native accent \"it's the real deal\".",

At 7:20 he shows up and I am outside, he has a cigarette in his mouth smoking with all the orders in the back, if that isnt enough the pizza was turned upside down sticking to the box and not edible , the tomatoes were green and the chicken wings were terrible. I will be contacting the health department because I can deal with crappy food, but smoking with the orders in the car is not acceptable. The manager Jessica was so nice and helpful. I suggest she gets another job where she is respected because the delivery driver decided to talk bad about \"the girls\" that work there!!! If he reads this they are the ones keeping this establishment open.",

My sister suggested this place, and boy was she right!  Excellent customer service and the product says it all.  Fresh ingredients and the quality of both the thin and thick crusts are divine.

I lived in Chicago for a while so I know what a good Chicago beef is like. The Amore Italian beef isn't the same but it's enough to remind you of a Chicago beef and sometimes that's good enough when you really miss Chicago.  What I like about Amore is the Chicago atmosphere and it seems to hold on to the staff of (Mostly) friendly girls. I like seeing a familiar face when walking into an establishment.  The one server tells me that Amore treats her very well, which is another reason I like it. I won't go to a restaurant if I know the staff is treated like shit.  Amore has a pretty good deep dish and I like their pasta sauce, so anything with a red sauce is pretty good.   I give this three stars because it's a fun place that reminds me of how good Chicago food is, but doesn't quite get me there to say \"holy shit this is just like the Chicago beefs (or deep dish) we used to get when we lived in Chicago!\"  The rest of the menu is good, but it's not gourmet food or even the best food ever. It's a fun place with a great Chicago vibe and the staff is good.",

If you are planning on ordering a deep dish or a stuffed pizza it's best to call like 30 min to 40 min before you come in because it takes them awhile to make. I've also noticed that when I order ahead of time and say that I want to eat it there it reserves your table. It can get crowded  but they opened up more seating recently. The ambiance inside is cozy and full of Chicago memorabilia from the Cubs to Oprah!  While we were waiting we ordered the mozzarella triangles which I always get because they are so delicious! If you are not into cheese the bruschetta is really good too! The pizza came out when we were almost done with our appetizer ...great timing! We ordered half pepperoni and half pepperoni with mushrooms. It's really heavy where one slice can fill you up but we still order the large so we can take the rest home for lunch through the week . Amore's is a great local place with spot on service and tasty food!",

I ordered the Wednesday special of ribs, which I have done on many occasions without any issues. I have never had a problem before, but today I picked up my order, drove all the way home and much to my dissatisfaction they all had no BBQ sauce. I called to tell the manager of the mistake. Where at first the manager didn't even want to take the time to take my call and told the girl who answered the phone that there was nothing they could do for me. After holding for five minutes I spoke to Shelby the manager, who informed me that they were low on BBQ sauce and had to be stingy. I told him if they had informed me of that when I ordered I would have gladly ordered something else off the menu. Then he proceeded to tell me indignantly, that they would not replace the order or credit me unless I brought back the whole order. Already home, I did not want to go all the way back. He credited me 15 dollars for a 50 dollar meal. Never have I been treated so rudely and not been compensated for a mistake on their end. In the future they may want to inform customers when they run out of something that is so detriment to the order. They have lost me and my family, my friends, business while under the duration of this poor management. While their tone may seem like they have so much business they don't care if they lose mine, I hope this review helps others choose another Chicago restaurant. One that actually cares about each and every customer they serve. Rosatis and Windy City are that place for me and they will get all my business from here on out.",

I told her water would be fine,  she never brought me a water.  My parents come and sit down with us,  no one came to take their drink order. We saw several other tables being served, some that came in after we did. My mother went to the front and asked for a waitress to come, we continued to wait for probably another 5 minutes - we waited well over 15 minutes total with no one ever coming by our table.

I ordered online and the girl at the register was flirting with an 80 year old man when I walked in and it took her two minutes to even acknowledge me and then another five just to find my ticket... The whole time I could see my food sitting in the window. My dad loves this place... He probably eats here once a week at least but the service is always a hit or miss.

After reading mixed reviews by a few of my friends on Yelp and watching the ATC video with Rosemary and the rest of the staff, we decided to give ATC a shot and decide for ourselves. As we enter, Rosemary and another Bulgarian gentleman (didn't get his name) is there to greet us.  We mentioned that it was our first time there, and as she mentions in the video, they are known for their deep dish pizza, so our lunch was already decided. She also said that the 50-year old oven they use and the Pizza Maker came from Chicago. How Much more authentic can you get? We entrusted Rosemary who has been there over 5 years and is a local from Chicago as well, and went with her suggestions- no more than 5 toppings, and we went with what she suggested: Suasage, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, and the MUST HAVE Hot Giardinera Peppers. Already knowing about the 45 minute wait, Rosemary Suggested the Fried Ravioli which was a great starter.Crisp outside, creamy Ricotta inside and a chiffonade of basil sprinkled on top, went very well with the warm marinara.  Our pizza arrives, and Rosemary serves up our first slices. First bite, flavor explosions in my mouth! The SWEET hand crushed tomatoes, creamy ricotta, meaty sausage, whole roasted garlic cloves, crispy pepperoni, and the mild heat of the giardinera all worked together in harmony with the crisp, buttery crust...this is the only way I'll have my stuffed pizza...Rosie's way! Now THAT'S  Amore!!!!....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(282/365) \"Chi-Town Pie\"",

So, when the family decided it was time to go out to eat, the majority voted for Italian and I let out a \"BOO!\" accompied with a pouty-face.   When Olive Garden was suggested, I quickly re-routed the decision and we landed at ATC. It was a busy parking lot and my grandmother is O2 dependent and uses a walker. Since the place has huge windows, the manager saw this and opened a side door for us. This set the tone for the wonderful service we would receive throughout the night.  We were seated right away, a waitress came over, took our drink order and handed us menus. The menu is extensive. Tons of pasta dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, pizzas, and house specialities. Pizzas take about 40 minutes to make so we passed. There is also a separate pizza counter for people placing to-go orders or who opted for pick up.  Drinks came out with the quickness as well as the perfect crusty homemade italian bread. Freshly baked, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. We each ordered a cup of the soup (minestrone) and needed a bit longer to peruse the menu.   Minestrone was great. A lot veggies, homemade, and it had a little, tiny kick to it. Bravo! Never tasted a soup like this before.  I've recently broken up with gluten. So I was stoked to see gluten free pasta available. I ordered gluten-free pasta and asked for a spicy arrabiata. It was awesome garlicky, flavorful, and packed heat.  Other dishes were sausage and peppers, with smacks of gardeny fresh peppers, mild Italian sausage and excellently balanced sauce. The baked rigatoni was also excellent and came with a massive amount mozzarella cheese. So heavenly sinful! (Did I just make an oxymoron, uh...)   Our servers worked in a team effort, drinks were full, we never left wanting or waiting. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was and told us about his establishment. I'm always way impressed when I see a hands on approach.  I love that there is a quality, decently priced, casual Italian place in my next of the woods. When I am feeling some sort of self-hate, I'm going to get all up in that deep dish. I think we'll be instant besties (damn you, gluten).  I'm totally in Amore with Amore and love is never wrong.",

He normally favors NY style pizza (but I'm from Chicago darn it, and you're gonna eat some Chi-town pie and you're gonna like it, mister! Hee hee.)   I ordered a small thin crust, half sausage and half cheese, and a plain cheese deep dish pizza. I've never had their deep dish but my friends have raved so curiosity got the best of me. I just wanted a small piece, I am a thin crust fan because deep dish crust is just too much bread for me. And YES, folks, it DOES take 45 minutes to cook a Chicago deep dish pizza, it's freakin thick! It is well worth the wait.   Both pizzas were delicious. I didn't hear any complaints from my boyfriend about it being a Chicago pizza..maybe because he was chowing down the entire pie. :) I would even go so far as to compare the pizzas to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's. Sweet home, Chicago! Mmmmmm mmmm mmm!",

They had a nice family and sporting atmosphere; if you like sports or have kids, this place is perfect for you.  The chicken wings are delicious. Definitely a must try, especially the wings with hotter sauce. We ordered a 14 inch deep-dish pizza with pepperoni on one side and more cheese on the other. Since this was our first time trying Chicago-style pizza, we didnt know what to expect, but we weren't disappointed with it. The pizza was really good; i wanted to eat more, but unfortunately i didnt have room, so we just took it home. The waitresses and staff are courteous as well. All in all, it was a really pleasant experience eating here. Definitely worth the 6 mile drive from the city.",

The sauce was slightly sweet which I liked, and not runny which is nice so the crust don't get soggy. We had the homemade sausage with mushrooms which were fresh not canned .we also had the fried zucchini and mushrooms. Which were very good, I'm not sure if they were made in house,  if they were good for them ! The italin beef ,reason for not having a perfect score, nothing special jus some roast beef on a roll and some au jus , I think arbys has the same thing, but  cheaper. Service was very good and friendly. I pre ordered our meal on advice of another yelper  . Food was ready at specified time. Great advice cause a deep dish could take 45 min.",

I have to preface my review with the comment that i really don't like chicago style pizza - as in the pie-style, i actually like their thin-crust pizzas.    we try some bread, salads, rigatoni with sauce, sausage w/peppers and onions  pizza - both thick and thin.  the highlights - the sausage pepper and onions and the thin crust meatlovers.  i thought the thick was kinda thin ( and yes, i've eaten at 3 different  places in chi-town, including uno ) - my one pet peeve , i thought their sauce was too sweet.  overall, it ain't a bad place and i can see myself dropping by to get some sausage, peppers and onions to go.  As to the chicago motif - except for a poster of an early 90's oprah, no one from the 21st century - about time they make space for our newest President !",

At 845pm called the restaurant again and informed them that nothing had been delivered since my initial call. It is always disappointing when you give your business to an establishment and they prove that they are actually not concerned with delivering good service. The employee did offer a lame \"it must be on its way\" as an excuse; really? one hour and 15 minutes to deliver GARLIC BREAD? Now, it isn't the money; it was garlic bread, only $4. It is simply a case of don't promise a service if you aren't able or willing to follow through. Sadly, the rest of the food was good; too bad I will not be ordering from them again. FYI GrubHub refunded the $4, so great, thanks GrubHub for standing by your service when the restaurant wouldn't. Trying hard not to sound petty over garlic bread; again, it isn't the money at issue, its the lack of follow through to make something right.",

The bread is baked fresh daily and plentiful, and I was able to order sausage and peppers as an appetizer.  As for the pizza I recommend the Margarita specialty pizza that comes on thin crust.  This is a casual place that does take time to prepare your food as everything is made fresh and to order, so for those that complain about the wait might want to bring better dining partners so the time can fly by as you wait.  I will come back as much as my diet allows, but it's worth every minute of extra time on the treadmill.",

I wish they would ask your preference. The pizza itself  was really good and flavorful. You could really taste the fresh crushed garlic and aromatic basil. The only down-side was that it was a bit salty. That's saying a lot since I like salty food but even for me it was too much. I combatted it by dipping my slices into some balsamic vinegar. It was like bomb garlic bread.   The deep dish was quite disappointing. No real redeeming qualities about it. I couldn't get over the salty sauce. This place would have gotten four stars had the food not been so salty and if the deep dish worth going back for. All in all, I would not come back for the deep dish but maybe for the margarita pizza, although there are so many pizza places to try in vegas that coming around back to this place might take a few months.   Not a stand-out in my book.",

It was an hour and a half wait but they told me that right from the get-go so that is okay. They took my credit card info without even telling me how much my total was first, which I found odd. This deep dish is no more than extra thick crust! The only thing deep about it was the crust. Had the same amount of cheese as a regular thin crust. I hope you like really sweet sauce because this is how it is.The crust was also overly dense and on the hard side. I called and wanted to 'exchange' one of the deep dishes for a regular thin crust. No-one wanted to eat it, not even my 3 & 4 year old.  I am not one to send food back but I just couldn't justify spending $42 (with tip)  on a pizzas that I felt sucked. The woman on the phone was not too overly friendly and as a matter of fact said \"That is just how our pizza is, I seen it come out of the oven.\" To me that is just bad customer service. In the end after a 10 min hold time I was informed that the manager was sending out a thin crust in exchange for the uneaten deep dish.  The one star rating is more for the pizza itself. I guess I would rate the customer service at more like a 2 since they did exchange my pizza with little hassle, although it was another 1.5 hour wait! The thin crust was much better but I wont order again since the sauce is way to sweet for me.",

Chicago Tasty Dogs is my all time favorite, but because I live on the Southwest area I wanted to try it out. My husband called and asked if we could put in out order before they closed, and she said as long as you put it in by 9:45 we will be ok, driving through the rain we called on the road to make sure we had our order in on time. It was 9:42pm and she said no i'm sorry, I closed down the register. Whats the point of having hours if you turn away good customers before your closing time when they assured us we would be fine. I explained that we had called earlier and you said it was fine, then she said her boss told her no. With the economy these days, turning away business is rediculous.

It only took an hour for delivery when I live just 2 miles away but I do understand the nature of the delivery business. I was just disappointed that it was luke warm and tasted like frozen pizza.",

    "text": "This review is for their stuffed pizza.We came here since South Chicago has apparently closed since my last visit, and we were looking for a Chicago-style pizza fix. My friend and I visited in mid-afternoon on a weekday. My friend was disappointed they don't serve alcohol; he likes a glass of wine with his pizza; it's something I never think to ask about. We both ordered a medium stuffed pizza, intending to take most of it home for meals over the next few days.  About 45 minutes later, our pies arrived. Both were the overstuffed delights like we had previously experienced, and we both have 3 days worth of meals packed in our refrigerators. I have some minor quibbles, so I'll address them here. First of all, they were out of mushrooms. How do you run out of mushrooms? So, no mushrooms on my pizza. The sauce was fine; we both agreed we liked it all right, but there was something about it that made us think it was not quite as good as what we'd had before. I ordered pepperoni and \"homemade sausage\" on my pie, and the sausage flavor was completely overpowered by the pepperoni. Next time I'll skip the pepperoni if I want to taste the sausage. Finally, part of the reason we visited the restaurant is that they did not deliver to our locations; we would have needed to use a 3rd party delivery service. In conclusion, I'll likely get pizza here again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Please don't close!",

They had a booster seat for our daughter and were prompted with our order. The service there was very good. The food however was a different story. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my wife got the ravioli's. The ravioli's were good but the presentation was abut tricky. It was on this massive plate covered in marinara and looked like more than it actually was. We ordered a side of the garlic bread which, while it tasted decent, could've been so much better. The cheese on it was a bit bland and it just looked so much better than it actually was. My chicken Marsala which came with spaghetti was not to my liking. Way too much Marsala in the sauce and way to runny. You take a chance with anyones chicken Marsala and this time I lost. All in all it just didn't live up to what I would expect good Chicago pasta to be like. But then again we are in Vegas.",

But that's fine it wasn't too too busy so maybe they weren't concerned about needing the table yet or something. It is cozy when it's not as crowded but loud in there if there is a big group. If you don't like loud crowds I'd say go while it's quieter and there are no Chicago games on just to avoid noise. But if you don't care about noise then by all means xD do your thing.  The gluten free noodles were better than expected.  The zucchini was good, and so were the raviolis from the sampler.  I plan to try the wheat noodles when we go back.  Gabe had some au juice sandwich that he loved so I'm glad he had it cuz he was craving it.",

    "text": "Whennnnnn the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's AMORE. Amore means LOVE, and being from Chicago, my family and I do love us some deep dish pizza. Grandma took my boyfriend and I here for dinner. It was fairly quiet on a Saturday night with only a handful of tables occupied. All the ladies that were working were friendly. They greeted us with smiles and warm pleasantries.   We ordered the large deep dish, sausage on the whole thing and half with pepperoni. We also ordered a couple beef sandwiches, one with hot peppers and one with sweet peppers and cheese, and added fries (they do not come with the sandwich and are an additional charge). Luckily for us, the beef sandwiches came out quick, which was good because I was starving! The sandwiches were good, I enjoyed the hot gardinera on mine as well as the au jus that came on the side for dipping. The fries are nothing special, I would skip getting those next time. Finally our pizza came out, and it was good, and very filling. This is the type pizza that you eat with knife and fork, and I could only eat one piece and was stuffed. Even my boyfriend who has a hearty appetite could only eat 2 pieces. They did not skimp on the meats or cheese, but the crust was lacking flavor. It could use some type of sprucing up, maybe some seasoning or some melted butter. It just tasted bland. Also I wish the pizza had more sauce, I love that sweet sauce with the chunky tomatoes. Still, the price is fair and we had plenty leftover to eat for lunch the next day. Grandma said that she hadn't been here in about 2 years and probably wouldn't come back for another 2. I guess she didn't like it. Oh well, I would come back if I was in the area and craving deep dish pizza and friendly service.",

When asked if they wanted to take home their pizza, the couple just said, \"no thanks.  We didn't like it at all.\"  The deep dish was also a disappointment.   The crust is off.   It isn't as buttery as good Chicago deep dish pizza.   The sauce is very bland.     They get two stars, because they have a wide menu, and they at least attempt deep dish pizza.  It isn't easy; the crust is different, and most customers don't understand that these pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.

    "text": "Amore Pizza Discovery!  I was grazing through the kitchen, looking for something eat, and opened up my fridge to see the leftovers from last night's Amore order.  I grabbed a slice of deep dish, and instead of warming it up, I went \"home on your parents couch\" style, and ate it cold.  SO TASTY COLD!  I don't know how to feel about this, but the deep dish pizza was much better cold than it was fresh from the oven.  I noticed flavors I couldn't really detect the first time around.  I would recommend keeping a cold one on hand for when your little brother or brother-in-law comes to visit.",

    "text": "We finally made it here after everyone raving about the deep dish Chicago-style pie made our mouths water. After working in Chicago for a lengthy amount of time and trying every pizza joint under the sun, Amore is OK, but not a worthy rave. The crust is buttery and overly sweet, kind of reminiscent of Gino's East. If you looking for a Giordano's/Lou Malnati's flavor, check out Rosati's or Maciano's...their sauces are a little more on the spicy side (read: more flavorful) and their crusts are not sweet so it doesn't seem like you're eating a pastry covered with sauce and cheese.   The place is cute inside and service very quick and friendly. I will be back to try a beef sandwich though!!!!",

This place has got them tasting closest to Chicago style Italian beef, but I'm still on the hunt for something that tastes just like Portillo's. Their Chicago style pizza is also very good. If you've never tried it before, get the smallest pie possible. One slice will do you in, unless you can eat like a total fatty. Oh, and of course, try the Chicago dog!",

Thank goodness we added the peppercini (spelled wrong, not fixing) otherwise I would have been convinced that I was chewing on a piece of cardboard. My son ordered the penne pasta, at least they remembered to add some flavor to that dish. Place was packed, so I'm clearly in the minority. Sorry but this place was not good. I'd rather order from Marcos pizza or make the drive to Cosmo for some secret pizza.",

    "text": "They have a special going on where you can get a large two topping deep dish pizza for $15.95 when it's usually much more than that. We called and ordered ahead of time because their pizzas take 45 minutes to bake.  Our pizza had pepperoni and sausage on it. The sausage was homemade, and it tasted delicious. The pepperoni had a little spicy taste to it just how I liked it. The crust was amazing. It was really chewy without being overly doughy... if you can even comprehend that. The large was huge! There were three of us, and 4 slices were consumed of it. Over half the pizza was left over, and it tasted good heated up the next day.  We also ordered mozerella sticks... except they weren't sticks. They were triangles! They were triangles of gooey, crispy, mozerella goodness. I have never had better mozerella sticks ever. We should have ordered 8 instead of 4.   The atmosphere was nice. There was some Italian music playing in the background, a bunch of baseball/football/chicago in general memorabilia throughout the restaurant.  The place was dead though. Only one other person came in while we were dining, which is a shame for a place with good pizza. I will definitely be back.",

I called and spoke to who i think was the owner and he is just clueless,  he tells me their regular pizzas are thin crust so I asked him why he didn't tell us that when we did say no thin crust. he had no answer.  he did say that is how we make pizza in Chicago.  well from this New yorker I say you can keep that pizza in Chicago. it was nasty. had to send my dad back for a refund. and I can say we will never order from them again.",
