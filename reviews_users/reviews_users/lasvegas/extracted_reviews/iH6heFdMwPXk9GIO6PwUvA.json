We had a cute little server that came up to us immediately and started talking about breweries. Such a warm welcome. We ordered a beer haus brat, hot link, fries and beer cheese. It was the juiciest brat I've ever had. The cheese was also amazing! Our food was brought to our table within 10 minutes. The beer speaks for itself. HUGE selection to please many. Craft, domestic, wine and cocktails. Great for big parties with different tastes. The entertainment was great!! We got there before the live music started so we had a chance to play 1 of the many board games. I wouldn't have imagined a place like this in Vegas!! Felt like home!",

Atmosphere - Big and open, and comfortable. A lot of different seating options depending on your party size.  Beer - Decent selection, not great.  Food - We shared the Slow-Roasted Pork Dinner. It was good, but not what we expected. The pork was three slices of spit roast pork, basically the sandwich without the buns. The pork was good but not a lot of it so the price/value is not good at this location, but you're on the strip so expected.  Service - Considering they were slow and we were at the bar I was surprised how slow the service was. A lot of talking going on and not enough working.  Overall, a good place on the strip to stop in for a good beer and a snack.",

They don't have too many options and aren't too vegetarian-friendly, but they are super generous with the portions. I got the basket of wings - it came with 6 delicious, hot wings with tons of thick fries. The ranch was really good and went well with both the wings and fries. I could only eat 5 wings and maybe 1/4 of the fries and had to take the rest home. My boyfriend got the ribs with fries and coleslaw. Their slaw isn't sweet at all and was really delicious/creamy - wish they gave us more of that and less fries! The toast needed more butter but it was well toasted. We asked them to put the BBQ sauce on the side which was a good idea - it was a bit too sweet for us, but good in small portions. The ribs were cooked with rub so they were tasty. Food came out fast and the waiters frequently walk around to collect trash - however you do have to line up and order food at the front and drinks from the bar in the middle of the restaurant.",

Every week before the game I've made my pregame festivities at this place. Last home game after having the same vegan chipotle dog-Something just wasn't right. About halfway through the dog I tasted a very terrible either Windex or plastic taste creeping up after I burped! This kept happening and started to become part of what I would smell for the rest of the evening. I became terribly ill. Then I contacted the restaurant by phone and asked where did they get their vegan dogs? I was told Whole Foods Mexican chipotle dog. So I went to check out this dog and realize that the instructions say \"PEEL PLASTIC CASING\" before cooking! These motherfuckers cooked my hotdog with the goddamn plastic casing on!!!  Fuck this establishment!!! Trying to fucking poison me and God only knows who else!",

Can't a waitress carry four open cups of beer through a crowd?  Really? You Suck!  Then after charging me $31.00 for the beer (typical strip prices), the waitress tried to beat me out of the change (it's not the amount it's the fact that it was done at all). She says \"I'll be right back with your change\" she never came back I had to go find her, 20 mins later. She says \"I was waiting for the bar to give me change\" She brought it right away. No tip for you. Really?  You Suck!  This is one of the oldest scams in the book. Hoping the customer would forget their change or be in a hurry and just leave. People need to be aware this is happening here.  I'm not a tourist. I live here and work service as well. This is not how you treat people.

So then my husband decided to order it.  We got the tab at the end and that specific beer was $12.  (gulp)   Important note - this beer was nowhere on their beer-list menu.  My husband specifically remembers looking for it, in advance of actually ordering it.   Now, I know, I know - we technically should have asked him what the price was in advance.  But, come on -$12?  The rest of their beers were like $8 so - Yeah.  It's just the principal of the matter and serves nothing but to deceive and turn off customers.  And it's the principal alone that prompted me to write this review.   I doubt the management even cares about this review as I see they are not following up to any of the other yelp reviewers on here.  This is a typical pretentions Vegas strip bar with the typical Vegas-strip tactics (resort fees at the hotels, anyone?  Ugh...)  We will return to Vegas but will never return to this place.",

    "text": "The Beer House, its English translation from Beerhaus (which you probably figured out) is much more than a house but a temple dedicated to the art of beer. Beer, beer, beer is my thing. You could invite me to any party in the desert with no water but as long as there is plenty of beer I am there. The bar/restaurant is located in the newly opened area known as \"The Park\" set between the NYNY hotel and the Monte Carlo. If you do not make it to the beerhaus you should at least walk around the area. Everything is nice and new. If you are walking from the strip just head west between the 2 hotels when you see a wide opening. I only visited the area at night so I do not know what it is like during the day.   Stopped in after catching One at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to get me some nice cold brews. The place has a nice open feel. If you have been to a Wurstkuche or Wursthaus it has the same concept. You order your beers one place and food at a different stand. It was close to midnight when we arrived and they had a reverse happy hour going with the food items at $4/each. Beer wasn't too expensive. I went with 2 different flights at $12 each just to sample a variety of beers. I was surprised to see the number of Vegas brews they had available. There some good stuff here. The food was okay. I ordered a brat and some fries with cheese. The brat was the better deal. I was a little confused with the food order because they gave me a light up buzzer but told me they would bring out the order but I told them how would they know where I was sitting. After the server walked around for a bit she was able to locate me.   They have live music going. The band likes to have fun with the crowd. Mainly playing some 90s-current alternative/pop/country. There are plenty of table games outside and jenga inside. You can write all the inappropriate messages on the blocks and nobody cares. HAHA! Staff was very nice and the customers were very friendly. I will definitely make this a regular stop when in town. Happy drinking!",

If you feel like getting away from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas strip and/or the casinos, then come right here to Beerhaus.  They've got a good selection of beer and food, along with a lot of games that'll entertain you for days. They got a ping pong table, shuffle board, and cornhole. Oh, and what bar would is be in 2016 if there wasn't jenga blocks laying around somewhere.  The night that we went here, there was live music. I don't know if that's a regular thing or not, but it was cool that there was live music on this particular night.  Highly recommended, but if paying for alcohol in Vegas isn't your thing, then I'd look elsewhere. Can get a little pricey up in here.",

    "text": "Considering this is clearly the signature spot of \"The Park,\" I expected so much more.  My visit came on a non-event night at the arena and I purposely walked around The Park and into Beerhaus instead of exclusively hanging out inside New York New York during the first Sunday night NFL game.  Beerhaus lost me quickly when there was no audio of the primetime football game in favor of live music.  Apparently, that's part of the atmosphere here. However, that may also explain why there were so few people in this place while other similar spots inside New York New York had more people in the seats with eyes on the football game.  If you're going to connect with sports fans and be a place they want to frequent before and after Knights games, you might need to establish some sports identity instead of looking like an alternative to it.  Kind of reminds me of many brewpubs who don't even show sports on TV in favor of people entertaining themselves. I don't think that's going to fly in Las Vegas when you're drawing primarily from people who are potential customers only because they're attending one or more of 41 regular season Knights games.  Millenials may be the Beerhaus' desired audience, but as someone who has attended NHL games in every US city, those are simply not the hockey fans who will give your place a chance to succeed in the coming weeks and months.  The overall space under cover and just out front is welcoming, but the menu and ordering procedure for food make this feel too much like a place in a Central Florida or Southern California theme park and not a full-fledged bar/restaurant.",

I brought my family to the Beerhaus to surprise my dad with Rolling Stones tickets that were playing at the T Mobile Arena next door. The management and staff made his 60th birthday the best ever! We got a nice booth in front of the TV playing our baseball game. We received excellent service. Everyone was friendly and attentive to our needs. There's games to play at the table and outside. The beer selection was amazing!! Even the amount of beers on happy hour was great. The food tasted just as good as the beer. We ordered fries with beer cheese, delicious! Even better were the fried pickles...we had to order two more rounds after the first order. We also got the chicken dinner. It came with their \"haus salad\" that was so crispy and fresh. It had romaine lettuce, avocado, tomatoes. It was so yummy! Needless to say, I will definitely be back! I don't get out much, especially somewhere that isn't near my house. With Uber and Lyft available, I can't wait to come back! I LOVE BEERHAUS!!!!!!!",

Also the set up is odd. The food and the drinks are separate entities so you order and pay for drinks from one server and then you have to go order and pay for food at the back of the place with someone else. That's annoying, when you go to a restaurant you want to pay once, not twice. And lastly, reading the reviews, people are saying they had the impossible burger but it wasn't on the menu. If they have it, I wished they'd put it on the menu.",

Love the open and airy set up with plenty of space going straight out to outdoor seating area littered with fun games like giant jenga, cornhole, ping pong (too bad racket is thin plastic making it hard to play for real players), and even live music.   Drinks were on-point and their hot dogs were amazing. Had the City dog which was crispy and juicy, then tried the Hot Link which was surprisingly hot to a level where non-spice aficionados should probably stay away. And their FRIES - is right up there in the crack fry category. Just simple, fat & meaty fries that begs to be dipped in ketchup & munched without hesitation. It came with cheese dip but since I was mooching off of a colleague I didn't dip.  For beer, I had the California Anchor which had medium body and paired greatly with the dogs without overpowering, and after few rounds had the Grapefruit Radler which was surprisingly not wussy though used it as after-drink drink.   Trivia was going on and questions were entertaining despite the guy trying to sell his podcast a bit too much. Then again, it's Vegas so can you blame him...?   More than anything though, it's the vibe this place has that really hits the mark that happens due to combination of happening location (has a generous promenade right outside), spacious setup, great food, and Vegas black magik.   Worth a trip over! My colleagues and I plan to return.",

    "text": "Interesting place. I came here with a friend who is a local while I was here on a business trip recently. He says he thinks it's a chain but we definitely don't have it in the Midwest.  They do a late night happy hour at least during the week, so we actually came here around 10:30 PM and then left and came back at 11 to take advantage of that. The hot dogs are normally around seven dollars but it was four dollars during this. I got one of those, a soda, and the fried pickles, which were whole pickles rather than pickle chips and were very good.  The restaurant is a bit unique in that you order at the counter, and then your food is brought to you and the server knows who to give it to because the buzzer you receive vibrates and lights up. However, a waitress comes over to your table to see if you want any alcoholic drinks from the bar as well, my friend ordered an old-fashioned from a waitress. I'm not sure why Beerhaus doesn't just combine these or perhaps let you order everything from the bar, but oh well.  I'd come back here when in the area, the food was very tasty.",

It is right near the New York, New York Casino.   They have a great selection of beers along with yummy cocktails As you know Vegas isn't cheap and that includes the drinks. This is a great place if you are looking for a few beers at realistic prices rather than paying $12 anywhere else.   The setting was very relaxed and inviting. The bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive. They also have a variety of board games to select from. My friend & I played several competitive rounds of Trouble.   If you are in the mood for some grub, they do have an area off to the side that you have to order from and then they will bring it to you whenever it is ready. I had the fried pickles which were actually pretty tasty but not what I was expecting. Instead of your average pickle chips they are long spears. We also had the french fries that hit the spot!  Overall, great place!",

After watching a show, me and slave girl were hungry and we passed by Beerhaus and decided to check it out.  At 9:55pm on a week night, seating was easy with plenty of empty tables. If you want to order drinks, sit at a table and someone would get your order. If you want food, sorry you have to order it at the counter by the door.  I went to the counter and ordered Beerhaus brat, hot link and fries with beer cheese dip. The dude at the counter took my order and gave me the total to pay... At that moment, the girl also behind the counter told me about the happy hour price and asked me if I wanted to wait for 3 minutes before putting in the order. Shame on you the dude behind the counter! Shame on you! I was going to tip the girl alone but couldn't find her when we were leaving.  Beerhaus brat came with IPA cheddarwurst, smoked bacon and onion jam. It was well made and very tasty. Same went to the hot link. It came with hot link, pickle slaw, and mayo. Very well made and had a good kick every bite.   The fries was fried perfectly. Too bad it was under season but nothing a salt and pepper couldn't fix. Beer cheese dip was fine but it didn't really help with the flavor too much.   Beerhaus also had lots of table games available so there was no dull moment when we were there. The service was wonderful. Our server checked on us often for beer refill and really made us felt like home. If you haven't checked out the place yet, give it a try.",

My friend really liked her beef sandwich. My hubby and I shared the pulled chicken sandwich, pretzel bites with beer cheddar, and fried pickles. I really love their food. It's reminiscent if not the same restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona and they are known for their amazing brats and brews!   You order food at a counter near the entrance of the restaurant and they give you a pager to put at the end of the table so the servers know where to find you. You can get beer either at the bar or a server will sometime find you and you can order with her. It's kind of confusing when they're busy and can't explain this. With open seating, I would come here when you have a lot of free time and not in a hurry to get someplace.",

I won a free beer (the coupon literally said \"on the haus\").

    "text": "After sugar crawling all day I was looking for something casual and light before seeing a show at T Mobile. I've walked by Beerhaus so many times and wanted to check it out. The food was a three star, but I liked the atmosphere and would definitely return.   The inside of the building is huge with a large bar, picnic table seating, large booths, and tables. Just inside the door is a cart of games that can be taken to the tables for play while enjoying food or drink. Outside are more tables and games to play.   Food is ordered at the counter just inside the door and then brought to the table. The menu includes sausages, pub appetizers, sandwiches, a chicken meal, a pork meal, and a couple of dessert options. The menu isn't huge, but the variety is decent. For food on the Strip this is one of the cheaper options. It was only about five minutes between the time we ordered and the time our food arrived at the table. Even though it isn't sit down service we were checked in on several times and plates were cleared as soon as we were finished with them.  I went with a Beerhaus Brat and a Pretzel. The brat had a delicious onion jam on top, but overall was just okay. The pretzels were really good and the cheese sauce had a good beer flavor that I enjoyed. My husband had a breakfast sandwich that he thought was pretty good.",

Beerhaus is located in the T-Moble Plaza and is a great place to grab some good food with some great friends. My fiance and I stopped in on a Saturday night just to grab a quick bite and beer and the place was packed. There was plenty of seating and tables available but on this night everything was occupied. There was a live band, people on the dance floor, people standing around, and simply people just having a good time. At the bar and at the table there were people playing all different type of board games.   To order food you just simply walk up to the cashier register by the main entrance. Once you pay, they give you a buzzer and when it is ready they will bring you your food to your seat. Condiments are available near the food stand as well as napkins and anything else you need.  I recommend Beerhaus if your in the area and in need of a great environment and some good food.",

The server who dropped off my warm pretzels was sorta cold. I thanked her as she dropped it off but she simply glared at me like I was an ex who did her wrong (yikes). Overall, it's a chill place and all. You can totally hear the entertainment outside (cover band on a Wednesday). They have games playing on the TV. It's a bit over priced though. Two beers and a pretzel was roughly $24. After tip (I did 20%) it was just under $30.",

They have games you can play as well. My qualm, and in my opinion, its a big one, is this place is way to over priced for some of their menu items. I get the $9 and $10 dogs, but I ordered a breakfast sandwich that cost $13. When I got it, if you take off the beer cheese, it litterally is an exact replica of a $1.69 breakfast jack at Jack in the Box. Seriously, I just paid almost 10 times the normal price for a Jack in the box breakfast sandwich. That is ridiculous. Fix your pricing and I bet your star rating goes up across the board.",

The lone exception was the bus boy who truly worked hard clearing tables and filling water glasses.   Great guy, no name badge to identify.   The food is very good.

WHY ON EARTH does no one want to expand other parts of this God forsaken city!! Now, my hatred for the Las Vegas Strip had no impact on my review of this establishment.   This place is almost like a more adult Gold Spike. There are games like janga, connect the dots, ping pong, shuffle board, chess. The ambiance is cool, there is live music on the weekends and the bar has ample room.   Service: BAD. The waiters rarely come around. I don't think they are assigned to tables or sections of the restaurant. I ordered water 3 times at the bar brought it back to my table and 3 times amidst the conversation I was having with friend the waiters would come around and pick up our full cups or water and take them away without asking. One even almost took my still half full drink (which was a $12 cocktail) while I was talking to friends.   Bar staff: The cocktails are all $12. I had a Tennessee Smash - it was super watered down and had no flavor. My friend ordered the exact same drink and hers tasted like strawberry juice. The bartenders are not consistent.  The BEER: they have an extensive beer menu but more than half of them are bottles are cans and range in price from $6 - $32.   The Food: my friends orders the chicken burgers off of the happy hour menu. Which is a great deal $4 for a huge burger. Unfortunately, they ate there burgers and felt sick to their stomachs after just 30 minutes.   This place seems like it could be really great, and they are new, but they really need to get it together quick. It seems they don't take pride in their work.",

We ordered two shaved beef sandwiches, a hot dog, pretzels, and fried pickles for 51 dollars. Price going to the strip. We were told to sit anywhere and they would find us. Soon after the food arrived. The hot dog was good. They got my wife's order wrong. The sandwiches were alrigt but the beef was dry. The pretzels were alright and the fried pickles were great.  Now the service. They have been opened long enough, through several big events at T-Mobile, to get service issues worked out. I will say I was there three hours prior to the doors opening. No one came to our table for a drink order. So I went to the bar. They seem to have no idea how to work a bar. They were running with no rhyme or reason. I waited ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me. The female bartender finally took my order but used the station were the servers were picking up drinks. This stopped that process dead. Though, she was nice and made my drinks right. I never did get another drink while sting my food because no one came by.  I will stop again for a beer or just walk into the Monte Carlo to get beer. I will have the pickles again but nothing else. I also see someone answers from the business but the device issue does not change. As long as the place is packed it will be just another strip food place that will underwhelm in the service area.",

    "text": "I've been looking for a bar like Beerhaus in Vegas for a while, if only it wasn't on the strip! Beerhaus has an amazing selection of beers (if only their ciders list was longer!) with many being straight from the breweries here in town and from Reno. The ones from in-state are even printed in a different color for easy ordering! How could you come here and not want to try one of our local brews?  There is a ton of bar seating, indoor and outdoor tables. The best part of Beerhaus is their selection of games. Two cornholes outside, jenga and connect 4 on almost every table, a ping pong table, shuffle board and even checkers. It's the perfect spot to come with friends and hang out. The beers are on the cheaper end (for the strip, of course). $6-12? They have  happy hour from 4-6P and 10P to closing. $4 featured beers and snacks during the 4-6P, $4 snacks during the 10P- closing.  I played cornhole, jenga, checkers, shuffleboard... okay I played everything. The bar was pretty empty on Tuesday night and we didn't have to wait to play anything. I'll have to come back to try the snacks- you have to order them at the counter on the side, they won't take your order at the bar! Park at the New York New York for fastest parking- don't forget they're charging for parking on event nights!",

All bartenders need customer service training. Service was bad and I will not go back. A simple \"hi\" or a smile can go a long way in the service industry. There are better bars/restaurants 3 steps away so I suggest you skip this place.",

Go somewhere else if you are looking for place where you feel welcome and want to enjoy a good beer. I came a long way to get the cold shoulder from the Beerhaus staff.

The food was great. The fries and pretzel with the beer cheese sauce was addicting. The  hot dogs were great and you could tell the meat quality was excellent.  Outside they have ping pong and giant Jenga. Inside they have regular Jenga as well as a ton of other games including connect four, checkers, battleship, and trouble.

But , a server that lies and ignores you.  Is just bs.    Food , we had the wing basket and fries , also 2 orders of fries.  Let me tell you , 6 wings were average at best.  The FRIES , they were so SALTY we couldn't finish them maybe eating 1/3 and tossing out the rest.  Not just a little too salty I mean a lot like the lid fell off the jar.   Server - we asked our server for drinks and the black haired server on the patio area told us she was going on break. Funny thing is we watched her continue to serve other tables the entire time we were there. Tried a second time and was told the same thing. Sad because we know how to tip well as we have worked in the service industry before.   I would not recommend you wasting your time going here.",

Now before even entering I do what I always do, whip my phone out and search them on YELP! After all that's what a faithful YELP fanatic is suppose to do right? I saw the reviews and a few pictures and it looked to give a try! So when we arrived it was actually election night so they were busy but not too busy! Lucky for me and my friend when we arrived it was to our surprise Happy Hour! Awesome! You gotta love when this happens! The cashier's at the front were very friendly and accommodating! I think it goes a long way when you visit a new place and mention it's your first time and the employee starts to make recommendations without you having to ask! The beer cheese and fries are a popular item because apparently the cheese is made with some of their signature beer hence the name \"beer cheese fries\" lol. Normally these things run for $8 and because happy hour was in full effect we scored them for $4! Very well worth it! The Bratwurst was another string recommendation from the staff which is also priced normally at $8! The brat was okay I mean I would order it again on a happy hour time because I believe it's most definitely worth the $4 but not $8. Keep in mind it's on the strip though so if you really think about it, it's priced fairly! If you love the game Jinga, they have these blocks set up at all the tables so enjoy a game of this while you wait for your food! I will for sure be back to try out some more things on the menu!",

Food is served in a separate section but is perfect if you're looking mostly to drink and not looking for a huge meal. Beerhaus sits outside the midst of the strip, so there is plenty to see and do outside of it. The board games are an added plus - a great way to pass the time and unwind with friends after a long day at work. All in all, the ambience of the place is lively, yet relaxing.  As I mentioned before, service is what makes or breaks a place, and at Beerhaus, the service is top notch. One server that deserves my recognition is Chrya. She always has a smile on her face, has a warm personality, and is quick to get our orders in. Oftentimes I find myself revisiting this place because of her. She knows the industry and her job well, can answer any questions about brews, and clearly knows the finer details about customer service that many others lack... a definite icing on the cake to an already awesome place.  If you're on the strip and need a place to relax with a beer and unwind, this is definitely the place to go.",

They had ice cold bottles of water and I had only one thought- man, I wish I could get an ice cold hef right now to go. Spotted Beerhaus and sure enough, they were able to deliver! Along with merciful shade and misters, the open space of the restaurant actually seemed like a breezy oasis in the midst of asphalt melting around me.   Naturally I was charmed. Though anytime anyone doesn't stare at me like deer in the headlights when I ask for hef, that's half the battle right there.   So next time I was in the area with the family, I campaigned to eat at Beerhaus. Since the rest of my family isn't nearly as enthusiastic about beer, they declined, but it all worked out.   I was able to get a delicious Cobb salad and a beer to go and joined them at a neutral seating spot outside. The cool thing about the little restaurant row that is going on in The Park is that there's so much awesome outside seating, everyone can grab good from the restaurant of their choice and meet up in the middle to eat.   I was drawn to live music (Thursday through Sunday) and mesmerized by the cool and laid back vibe of the Beerhaus, but my family wasn't budging.   Too bad for them, I do think the rest of the menu was simple but pretty cool.   Can't wait to return and maybe actually partake in some of the activities they offer.",

As soon as the hockey game was over, they switched to football like I asked. When I asked the waitress how they were able to do that if the TV's were locked she said, \"The manager did It.\" So they're not locked, the manager just wouldn't turn to the game when there wasn't a single person in my section! If they would have just said no, I wouldn't be writing this review but they point blank lied! Horrible customer service.",

I know they just opened, so they are probably still working out a few kinks and trying to figure out what works best for them.  My boyfriend and I were excited to try this Beer Garden and were hoping to find some great authentic beers.  When we heard they had happy hour every single day we were sold and made our trek to the Las Vegas strip.  The happy hour is great for the food...not so great for the alcoholic beverages.  The set up is very interesting.  You wait in line, order your food, pick it up at the counter, and find anywhere to sit - like a quick/limited service restaurant.  The alcohol though will be brought to your table by the servers and it is on a different tab/check.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Pretzel & Beer Cheese and the Bratwurst.  The food was very delicious.  I was pretty impressed with the food and if I was on the strip and was in the area would probably grab a quick bite to go.  The service for the drinks on the other hand was very slow.  Our server was very sweet and personable, but terribly slow.  I do not think it was her fault, it looked like she was the only server for the whole restaurant!  There were more busboys then there were tables...but only one server!    I was a little dissapointed with the beer selection.  The Happy Hour for the beer included domestic cheap beers and nothing authentic.  The rest of the beers were a little overpriced...which I expected from the strip.  The Cider selection was very sad...there were three ciders and none of them were imported or anything to write home about.    Overall, if I had family or friends in town staying on the strip I would probably go back for the food and give this place another shot.  I will not go out of my way to come back though.",

Games are on the family style picnic benches so you can hang out and spend some quality time with the family or watch a game with some friends while you enjoy a cold beverage.  However, one catch, the waiter/waitress can only get your drink order.  You'll need to stand in line to order food like at a fast food joint, but they'll bring the food over to you.  Not sure still how this lands on me, but I guess it's their operating model.  Food is still worth experiencing if you find yourself early and waiting for a concert or sporting event at T-mobile.",

I'm only writing from a food standpoint since I don't drink beer. Between the two of us we ordered the patty melt, buffalo wings, and the bratwurst. I would say that for a sports bar, the food isn't bad! The wings were pretty standard, but still good. The patty melt would have also been standard but they topped it with caramelized onions which definitely added a nice sweet boost to the flavor. Would have been nice to come with fries or some side (which are $5+ depending on what you get). The same goes for the bratwurst...the caramelized onions definitely helps with the flavor but its already pretty flavorful and juicy. This was probably our favorite of the things we tried. Also service was really fast, but it was also a Monday evening lol. However everyone was very friendly. For a sports bar, the food was pretty good!",

The food I had was  satisfying which you would order from the left side separate from the bar area. I ate the Beerhaus Brat: ipa cheddarwurst, smoked bacon & onion jam... unique flavors and delightful.  As for beer I opted for *Breckenridge Vanilla Porter*... loved it!   I love the ambiance here and it is casual where you seat yourself with an open and airy feel opening out into the outdoor patio along with live music (Tuesday nights) you can hear from the nearby outside stage of *The Park*.

You order when you walk in at the counter and they give you a pager to know when to come get your order. Self serve soda machine and the place was clean. $70 for 3 people to eat and have 1 beer for 2 people  and beware they charge $5 for a freaking soda that's why 4 stars as that is excessive imo I mean the beer was cheaper than a soda!",

She politely asked us what she could get us to drink. As the night went on I watched her go out of her way to greet each guest with a smile, thanking each guest, and providing great service to each one. She was very friendly to engage in conversation and enthusiastic to make sure the guest  were acknowledged with a; \"I will be right with you or what can I get you to drink\"? The best part was being able to listen to the live music and also being able to watch sports on the TVs. Although we did not order food, I would in the future visit this beer stop just to stop in and get great service from Kristyn! Thank you Kristyn for your hospitality!",

The restaurant is in a great location at The Park and we were happy to be able to get a spot at one of there picnic tables. As expected a huge selection of beers on draught and bottles. You have to go up to the \"eats\" counter to order your food but the good thing is they deliver the food to your table. We had the roast beef sandwich, the roasted chicken dinner, a hot dog , pretzel with beer cheese and some fries. Everything was really good, nice portions and super tasty. My son had a \"bye Felicia\" for desert which was an ice cream sandwich. He loved it of course. Our waitress and all the staff we met were super nice and friendly and they all seemed to work as a team. When I got the check I was happy to say it wasn't as bad as expected. We were there for a few hours and there was about 6 ppl on my tab and it was only 250 with the tip. They also have Jenga at the tables and fooz ball table that was great for keeping my 8 yr old happy when he lost interest in the game. I definitely recommend Beerhaus for locals and tourists to come and watch a game and pre or post spot for any events at T mobile arena.  Thanks for making a great night even greater. Go Knights Go !!",

That is, a low key beer garden with a large and relatively interesting tap list, bottle list, and... GASP... cheap bar food!  I actually ended up coming here 3 separate times on a 4 day trip that was part business/fun (mostly fun!). We enjoyed the happy hour. Probably the only place you can get a $4 sausage and $4 craft beer on the strip. The place was never overly crowded and all of the tables are well spaced out. It feels like a large space both inside and out, yet has some of the charm of a smaller craft beer gastropub. The outdoor picnic tables are inviting and there are the requisite cornhole, giant jenga, and shuffleboard games outside, which actually weren't packed. I did end up coming here nearing midnight on a Sunday and it seemed dead, not sure if this is standard though it is Sunday so who knows. But honestly I'd rather drink good beer in a calm location than drink $14 coors light at a crowded club where I can't talk to anyone. Vegas does indeed have something for everyone.",

They offer all sorts of board games and table games, from pool, Foosball, ping pong to Jenga and other games, making it a more fun experience for groups of friends. Food is as good as you would expect from a typical bar, and maybe a little better with more choices (fried pickles??), but if you are there, it has to be for the activities you can do besides staring at the TV screens. A definitely good destination spot for friends, old and new, and a walking distance from the T-Mobile arena and other cool eating establishments. As with all other places on the strip, you will have to come up with the extra parking fees, which is a bummer when you are hauling visitors from hotel to hotel, but it is not their fault. Would be nice if all restaurants offered parking validation for patrons like many places do in other cities and malls... But that is a completely different subject I guess. So definitely go there for the food, drink specials and stay for the entertainment, or the other way around; either way, you cannot go wrong...",

    "text": "A much needed retreat! The Park area is away from the onslaught of smoke and flashing lights of casinos. This is a casual restaurant bar that has you order at the front counter and then grab a seat somewhere outside or in the bar area. What first had me excited were the prices. Could this still be expensive compared to a local bar/restaurant in someone's hometown.. Yes. But for Las Vegas my god it's bang for your buck.  I was here for a Las Vegas knights game during lunch time and couldn't pass up on the chicken dinner. The half chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies along with a side salad for $15 was a great option. And talk about filling! Everyone in our group was happy with their choices between the hotdogs and sandwiches, even the fried pickles were pretty good. I had to steal a fry from a friend to try the beer cheese and it was quite good.  Of course the beer selection was great and you'd be hard pressed to not be able to find something you'd like. Even though this day was particularly crowded(day after st. Patrick's day and right before a game) the food and drinks came out very fast and really again was just great all around.  It's hard to get excited about another \"beer house\" these days but in a town where it's either a buffet, 5 star blow your budget, or over priced cafes, this way a fantastic escape and break from it all. Yes it's going to be loud and yes its going to be crowded but people it's Las Vegas..",

You start by ordering your food at the register and a server bring out your food. On tour way to a table you can chose from their selection of board games. They have live music on some days and happy hour specials.   Now the food: I ordered a Vegan Chipotle Hotdog. It was so good. I was a little iffy about the tomato jam but it ended up being my favorite part. They also have another vegan hotdog in a traditional style.",

I wanted to order the patty melt and asked if they could put cheddar cheese on it instead of Swiss. The girl taking my order told me that was not possible for them to do. She did however tell me that they could put no cheese on it if I wanted. So I chose the no cheese option. Not sure how that makes any sense at all. You have the ability to put no cheese at all but can't switch the cheese out for a different kind?!   So I think asked her for a side of ranch and she said that they charge $1.62 for a side of ranch. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard in my life.   We proceed to sit down at a table, and when the food comes I notice that my sandwich has cheese on it. So they took it away to remake it with no cheese.   And the most infuriating this about this whole dining experience is that we were sitting at the table for 30 minutes and not once did a server come up to us to take our drink order or check on us. 30 MINUTES!   We were so over it that we decided to take our money elsewhere to have drinks because we were just appalled at hot terrible the experience was.   Needless to say I will never be going back there.",

You order at the front and they bring out your food to you.    As for their food.. I get it's Vegas but I don't understand why the only remotely healthy option, a salad, is $16.  The chicken was so dry, I had to eat around it.  The salad was so bland, that the only redeeming quality (the avocado) still couldn't save the dish.  Yeah, I'd consider this a cleaner option if you're looking to watch a game vs. in a casino.  But the next time I come, it'll only be after I'm full.",

It's conveniently located near the new T-Mobile arena, NY NY and the Monte Carlo.   Although they offer a huge selection of beer the food menu is limited. That's why the name is Beerhaus and not Foodhaus. There are more option of lagers than the food options. The food menu includes primary pub items like hot dogs, fries and burgers. Anything that can possibly give you an heart attack is most likely in there.   Service is limited so don't drink too much before dinner because you'll have to stumble your way to the counter for your order. It's more of a self serve style restaurant. Order your food, order your beer and then find your own table. Occasionally there's a live band present. It could be a good or bad thing depending on the performer. Other things to keep you entertained at the table includes dominoes, jenga and cards. There are indoor and outdoor seatings.",

It did take a little while before we got any service.  It took asking an employee passing by to ask if there was a waiter in the area.  Connect four kept us occupied until we got help.  What I like about this place is that they have table top games and table tennis, foosball, and no one could figure out that other gliding table game.  That's what I like about bars that have Jenga, and checkers, games, etc.  Makes it more intimate.  We grabbed a few drinks.  We didn't try their food, but the menu does look good.  I do want to come back to try the food.  Don't ask me why, but I liked the faucet in the ladies room. :-)  So with that being said, Happy Eatings and Drinking!!",

This is ok when it's not busy, but when there's an event or it's busy, who wants to be standing in line waiting to order food? Other than that, I love the location, selection of beers, and the overall atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'm a Vegas local so I'm probably not their target demographic.Anyways...  The place is narrow and feels really closed in. Drink prices are relatively expensive ($12 vodka and soda). It seemed that everyone was inexperienced. Asked waitress for a beer and she informed me they didn't have it (Newcastle). Not a big deal, I told her to have the bartender get me something comparable. She was very confused and asked more questions. Finally I said, \"ask your bartender to pour me a beer that is comparable to Newcastle, I don't care what it is.\" Also, later in the night, I asked two different bartenders for a shot of something good and strong. One poured me a shot of patron and the other a shot of Jameson. lol really That's all you got up your sleeve. Finally, if you want food you have to go order it yourself up front and pick it up when its ready. Lazy, Lazy!  I wanted to check out the park and I did. I definitely will not be going back to this place or the park either. Average bars and parking is horrible.",

The counter and wait  staff very kind and attentive, cleared table without having to ask, I even ordered some to go and it was well prepared. For the price you can't beat it for Vegas, as I'm not big on buffets and I don't eat enough food to pay those prices. Overall for Happy Hour  prices It's a great bargin with Great tasting food and a nice bar atmosphere. I would definitely go back or recommend going for a quick bite to eat.",

Positive: Good location Reasonable ambiance   Negative: All food must be ordered at counter even if you are seated at table. Out of multiple beers  Big Negative: Ordered two shots of JW Blue I watched as the bartender poured the first shot and then had almost nothing left in the bottle for the second.  He then walked over to two other bartenders and asked if they had another bottle. No was the answer.  So then he walked over the the main guy (manager) and asked what to do and he told him to just pour out some of the first pour and make two level 1/2 shots. When the waitress brought them over I inquired about how I was basically getting 1.5 shots AT BEST of EXPENSIVE whiskey and she went back and checked with bartender who informed her his first shot was an \"overpour\".  If that's the case, why ask for another bottle or ask what to do when you didn't have enough to fulfill two shots?  They still charged full price for the shots even though they comped our group a couple beers for not having the beers we ordered.  So they will comp inexpensive beer, but if you order expensive whiskey, you get nothing. They should have let me know they only had enough for one shot rather than serve two inadequate shots. Not a big deal if $10 shots, but they charged $51/shot and I definitely didn't get my money's worth.   Before anyone says I should have contacted the business.  I tried.  I talked to the waitress and got an excuse.  I tried contacting online and by  phone and got no response.  I'm sure this place doesn't care about under pouring and overcharging as next week will bring the next wave of patrons, but there are PLENTY of better places to spend your time and money in this area of Vegas.",

    "text": "MGM laid down a 4.5 million dollar bet on craft beer in Las Vegas and from what I see the bet paid off huge. Beerhaus at The Park is not one of the faux beer halls you will find on the Las Vegas strip. Beerhaus at The Park is a real deal craft beer destination with a selection of beer that will impress any beer fan, great food and staff educated to make intelligent suggestions on beer selections and food pairings.  Let me start with the beer. As I bounced from beer hall to beer hall in Las Vegas, I was disappointed to find the same macro brew options repackaged to look like smaller brewers. Variety was lacking as was the staff's knowledge of what they were pouring. Unlike these \"beer bars\" Beerhaus at The Park has a world class beer menu. I was pleased to find not only local and regional offerings but also legendary craft beers from around the country. You may ask what I would consider being legendary. How about Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA on tap.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Not only did the staff suggest some of their favorite offerings they asked my about my tastes in craft beer and made the appropriate suggestions based on my tastes. I have met many knowledgeable and helpful bar staff in the past, but the level of knowledge of product with this staff was mind-blowing. As the conversation evolved, I was delighted to find out all bar staff is required to receive Cicerone Certification Program training.  Just another indication of the Beerhaus at The Park's dedication to excellence. The food at Beerhaus at The Park is on par with everything else I experienced at this world-class venue.   There are pub favorites served with a bistro flair. The pulled chicken sliders and sausage sandwich were exceptional. As was the soft pretzel that was served with my beer. After three of the staff had told me I had to try the fried pickles, I decided to give them a try. The fried pickles had an unexpectedly spicy batter that played off the hops in my IIPA wonderfully.  Typically in these pub reviews, I stick to the beer and food of the venue. In the case of Beerhaus at The Park, I must also comment on the entertainment. Noticeably absent were the slot and poker machines you find everywhere in Vegas from the airport to the convenience stores. It was nice to find a place to drink a beer separated for lights, sirens and the sound of coins dropping out of machines. There is ample outdoor seating to compliment the spacious indoor bar. Outdoors patrons can pass the time playing ping-pong and a host of games supplied by Beerhaus at The Park.  If you are not the type for ping-pong, you are sure to be entertained by the live entertainment. During my visit, the band playing on the patio was one of the best cover bands I have ever heard in my life.  Watching the guitarist of the band perfectly bang out the violin solo of Charlie Danial's \"The Devil When Down To Georgia\" on his Fender Telecaster made me forget for five minutes I was still working on my Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA.  To sum this up, Beerhaus at The Park has great beer, phenomenal food, and world-class entertainment. Even you macro beer fans will find this to be a fun Vegas destination. While the beers you see advertised during the Super Bowl are absent from the tap the variety of offerings will accommodate any palate.",

This location is great to get your pre-drinking on or after an event from Park Theater or the T-Mobile arena.  The staff are great and very attentive. While the food is not as great at the rest of the comps in the area, this place is definitely a must for crowd. If you are a beer fanatic, then this place is for you as they have tons of selections.   It's definitely a good place to hang out, relax and cool down.",

    "text": "Beerhaus SHOULD be a great place to hang out before or after Vegas Golden Knights games, but for a sports bar in the shadow of the T-Mobile arena they aren't very friendly to sports fans.  As a result, it's just not the best place to hang out if you want to watch sports & grab a drink before or after a hockey game.   The waitresses and bartenders are rude and distracted, focusing their attention on tourists and not the VGK locals. The bar is too crowded to place an order or drink at and the people behind the bar seem to ignore anyone in a VGK jersey.   There is table service for drinks, but not for food which needs to be ordered at a walk-up counter and will then be delivered to a table.  Table service is slow with the waitresses rushing you to place orders but rarely checkout up to see if you want anything else   On a night when there were multiple hockey games on, basketball, NASCAR, NHRA and college sports available, there was a crappy cover band playing LOUDLY and poorly on the speakers. You can use Tuniity to stream audio from the TVs, but the music drowns out  the audio from any phone.   The food is good and is delivered to the table quickly and hot. Typical bar choices, including burgers, hot dogs, pretzel bites, fries, onion rings, etc.  If Yelp allowed 1/2 stars, I would give Beerhaus 2 1/2 stars. They only get 3 stars due to their proximity to the T-Mobile Arena and the large selection of local beers.",

    "text": "This is a place in Vegas to relax, at least I did.  Whats most remarkable about this place is its setting on The Park. Beerhause anchors the new Park between New York New York and Monte Carlo (soon to be The Park Hotel and Casino) and steps from The Park Theater. The actual park is very nice, and very beautiful. It does seem a bit unfinished and although like The Link in size,it's far more subtle.  Like I said The Beerhaus anchors so far, It's a big place with lots of outdoor space to play and dine, or just drink. Its like The Yardhouse but far more casual and feels more like a German beer garden.   Service is far more casual as well, you order your food at a food counter and nobody complains if you walk up to the bar for beers and drinks. There are servers outside and in but when busy its almost a free for all. Every bartender was fast, professional and eager to serve/sell.  I thought the food was great, even ultra casual but still high quality and the bar efficient, and well priced for Vegas.  Although its not perfect it's still excellent",

Beerhaus has some local brews from the area that are brilliant! I remember having one that was a stout and it was so good that I had to get a second! And for being on the strip the prices out here are amazing! There are ton of board games inside, and games outside such as giant jenga.  I'd also recommend this spot if you're trying to catch a game too... numerous TVs are located throughout the bar.

There are a lot of table options and a large square bar in the center of the space. What they also have is a lot of games... nearly every table will at least have jenga, but in the back they have shuffleboard, ping pong and table soccer.

There are games inside, and the drink menu is pretty awesome too!",

The bartenders are more concerned with talking to each other than providing any type of customer service. And don't ask Jacyln for a happy menu.. she will toss it at you. I went on a non Golden Knight game night and you have to wait 7 minutes for them to acknowledge you or even offer you a drink.",

    "text": "Being locals, we typically try to avoid the strip, but when we do come we have our go-to spots!  We stumbled upon Beerhaus before a concert at T-Mobile. Great selection of craft and local brews with pretty decent happy hour prices. Since then we've followed suit for the last three events we've been to. Throw on a brat and pretzels with beer cheese and your pregame meal is complete!  We typically have them cut the brat in half and we split it along with the pretzels. Just enough to soak up the brews before heading into T-Mobile without feeling too stuffed (don't forget your roadie for the walk down). The prices are GREAT considering you're on the strip which makes it a bonus! We've been known to have four rounds and grub for under $50. You just have to be open minded to whatever is on happy hour ($4 craft beers).   Now, the ambiance is on point. Love the beer garden feel with the outside patio tables. We've even been known to come down on a beautiful day with the kids. They're entertained with Jenga, connect four, ping pong and cornhole while mommy and daddy enjoy a frosty. There are always other kids to play with too which is a perk!   Overall, this is a great spot for all ages. I wouldn't say to bring your kids on a Saturday night (you wouldn't find any others there anyway), but for a day time pit spot, a cheap spot before T-Mobile, or even just a place to stop and rest during your haul up and down the strip, Beerhaus is worth the visit!",

On nights where there's an event at the T-Mobile arena, there's no happy hour.. Which is fine with me but that means there's no happy hour a lot of the times! They have a wide selection of beers, which they should since it is called beerhaus. What I liked about the place was that they had hard liquor as well. Most beer places do not serve hard liquor so if you're going in a group you can't really cater to everyone's needs or if you want a kick to your drink they'll have it! Overall, this is a great place to meet friends or to grab a drink. Do expect to pay strip prices though for your drinks. And make sure you carefully read how many ounces of beer you're getting for the one you're ordering because at this place, it varies a lot!",

Just finding a sports bar where I could sit a while and watch the NCAA games was nice but they have a very nice selection of beers and I liked we could order a hot dog to go with it. The highlight though, was our server Katie. She knew about the different types of beer and made suggestions based on what we normally drank. She also knew the history for some of the different brews which was interesting and entertaining. The place is good sized with out door seating and it looked like Katie was taking care of half the tables herself but she stopped by regularly to see if anything was needed, always smiling and happy. In a town based on service, she should be the poster person. Overall, great experience. Excellent beer, good food, nice setting and great service.",

There are also plenty of different types of games you can play too if you bring others with you. (ex: connect 4, jenga, and other board games along with larger ones towards the back). Time to get to the food and service overall. The food? GREAT! had the brat along with a pretzel and fries. Prices (food wise) are not too bad, and theyre not small portions either. Now to the drinks! this IS a beerhaus right? Why yes it is but you have to remember its also on the strip so this is where they can get you on the $$. Paid about $8 a beer, mainly German hefeweizens. Lets just say that I typically pay around $9 for an entire 6 pack (same brand too). There are PLENTY of other beers on the menu, in fact the selection is huge, but if I'm going to a \"beerhaus\" I'm not going to have a plain $3 bud light. I want a real beer for a good price.  Like I said, this place is on the strip so they're going to get people paying for whatever no matter what. The service was ok. Very slow and took about 15 mins just to get the tab but it also looked like she was the only one working on a busy afternoon. I Kind of felt bad for the girl. Lets just say this: if you're on the strip definitely check it out, if you're a local and have no reason for going to the strip then don't.",

    "text": "The Beerhaus is the newest, hippest place on the strip. Whether it's the giant jenga or any of the other table games, or the myriad of TV screens showing your favorite game, there's always something to see and do while enjoying your favorite brew or tasting something new. If you get hungry you can run over to their ticket booth/food window and order up your favorite pub food or snack. Though this concept is still lost on most people, once you get the hang of it it's not a bad idea at all-after all folks, it's a drinking place! As this concept is new to Vegas, so is the concept of great service to the staff and management. Each time we've gone we've had slow service, the servers seem overwhelmed even when the place is not at capacity but, I have hope that eventually management will figure out the winning formula to make everything work. The last time we visited I spent the night correcting our server on the status of our bill and even turned her back when she brought us drinks we didn't order. The prices are what you would expect for craft beer on the strip though domestic beer prices seem tolerable. if you have a favorite domestic beer you enjoy, maybe its best to stick with that thru the night otherwise you're going to experience sticker shock with each round of especially brewed craft beer you order. When there's a band playing, the environment picks up as most people like to request their favorite tune, adding to the already positive vibe of the place. As I am not a local I can't speak to the pain locals feel paying the astronomical parking fees on event nights at the T-Mobile arena. I imagine this might steer locals to their favorite watering hole away from the strip on these nights, this too has to have a solution sometime in the near future. In the long run I believe Beerhaus will become one of the favorite drinking joints on the strip, Cheers!",

But that's a good deal if you lost all your money and need cheap eats! We were here on a Monday afternoon, so it was not busy at all. We walked up to the bar. The bartender didn't show up for at least 5 minutes. We asked for a beer menu. Another 5 minutes goes by and she's nowhere to be found. Our friends grabbed a table and a server came over. So we decided to just order from her instead. I'm not sure what the bartender was doing? Even when she gave us the menus she seemed unhappy to be there. Maybe she was just having a dad day? Our server was pretty nice though. At least she was willing to get us drinks. The servers don't bring you food. You have to order at a window and then get it yourself when it's done. They give you a pager. When it came time to close our tab it was extremely confusing. It has a ticket price AND a total? Makes no sense. We asked the server to explain and she herself couldn't even explain it. Hopefully they are still working out the kinks on this system. It's similar to Beer Park at Paris with the games at tables. But their beer selection is not as good. I was hoping for a cider type beer or something more summer-like. But they really didn't have much of that. I ordered an old fashioned which was on their cocktail menu. I'm from Wisconsin so I should have known better than to order that in Vegas. But, I figured it would be good if it's on their menu? It was awful! Nothing close to what it should be. But the strawberry Mojito was excellent!",

The food,  you have to order it from another counter in the restaurant and pay for it there - your waitress won't take your food order.  It is kinda limited to French fries, soft pretzel bites, and deep fried pickles. So it's separate from your liquor tab.  The place is called beerhaus- but sorry we are out of that and that is only available in a can- oh and that beer is only available in a can too.  Give me a glass to pour it in then-out comes a plastic cup- which is not terrible -but still. I expected so much better.  This place won't last - I will put in a futures bet on it.  Just imagine if the place was better managed and the selection was up to snuff on a concert night?  The place was 3/4 full - I would think it could be busy crazy- because next door is a CPK!!  They are sitting on a gold mine - but they act like it'll just pay for itself.   It's a no brainer- Drinks and stuff before a concert?? -I'd be doing promotions - have the Miller or Corona swimsuit girls be pouring drinks and giving out free stuff - and making Bank!!!

Ageta or Aggie as she like to be called is by far one of the of the best servers I have had in recent memory. All I had to do was order a beer once and she remembered for the rest of the week I was there. She is truly a standout in an industry where service has taken a back seat to volume. I can't wait to be back next year and as soon as I check into the hotel I will be off to the Beerhaus. The food is really good too. Nothing compliments a nice dogfish head 60 Minute IPA like some pretzels and fried pickles. Tuesday nights they have trivia which is a blast! If you are in Vegas, make sure a stop at the Beerhaus to see Aggie is on your todo list!",

I felt the other selections on draft were fairly typical for local beer specialty places (Miller's Ale House, Aces & Ales, Yard House).I did like that they served food very late, but wasn't really impressed with the selection. I ordered a porchetta sandwich and I thought it was pretty greasy and bland. The fries were good, but the red velvet whoopie pie was gross. Took a bite, gave it to my friend who also took a bite and then we threw the rest out. Cool idea to have games available for people to play, but not enough to bring me back.",

The icing on the cake however was the service. Our bartender was incredibly friendly and genuine and paid close attention to our beer levels without hovering or pressing.

I ordered one blonde, pretzel bites, and a bratwurst (lol I think that's what they're called) and it totaled about $32 with tip. The food wasn't bad; it was just wow for that price. Beer was hoppy because it was that one brand with the rock fish on it, pretzel bites were delicious with the cheese sauce and it's saltiness, and the bratwurst had a great taste and very juicy but I still had to add a bit of ketchup and mustard. Besides the food, the place had lots of room, lots of games to play with friends, and even a live band at times. Your best bet is to walk to this place or Lyft it because if you self park, it would have to be at New York New York or the Monte Carlo (aka the Park MGM) and they charge for self parking.",

Food, however, was delivered quickly - we shared the loaded tots and they were delicious. Service at the food counter was quick and they were friendly.  It put a bad taste in my mouth when we went up to the bar to ask for a cup of water and the bartender looked at us straight in the eye then turned around and went to do something else.

The beer selection was not as large as I hoped for, but it was decent. There's a small counter where you can order food. The menu changes, to my understanding. We ordered the Mac n cheese bites and those were delicious, also ordered other small bites.I even ordered a salad, which was ok. The service was not bad at all, our waitress was always checking on us (of course you had to purchase beer in order to have a seat while watching the fights). The place got packed but not overly packed which I liked. I'd definitely would come here again.",

Third, beers are served in cheap plastic cups, which are both horrible for taste and environmentally unfriendly.  What did I like? Decent list of beers.  Pretty good service.  Lots of TVs to watch sports.  The lady serving me (Ana?) just talk a bit more with me and was really sweet (added a star for her)!

That kinda sucks but that's okay. We got beer and wine and I was shocked at how much local beers and IPAs they had. The wine list only had about 5 or 6 to choose from and there were a few cocktails to choose from. The place does have the name beer in it though, so it only makes since to have mostly beer, right?

Slightly below average cost for the area. Plenty of beer. Decent food. Enough TVs to stay busy. A beautiful outdoor area.   Then comes the special part. Super attentive and kind staff. I don't know if it's company culture, my luck, the hiring staff, or fear that puts smiles on their faces, but it works. Unlike other places, I can't go here without 3 different people checking in on me. Yes, your conversation might get interrupted, but your water will always be full and good luck getting 3/4 through your beer before they are checking to see if you need another. Also, you can't find bigger hockey fans in the desert. I don't mean customers, I mean the staff. I'm sure working steps away from T-Mobile Arena helps, but these guys know their stuff. I can talk hockey from 5-10 years ago and they know what's going on. It's probably all of that NHL Network they have playing constantly, but it's a huge draw for me. That said, NHL Network is on a TV at all times (probably not during Football games).   This is a great spot with great people and beers. So much so, that I didn't even steal the pint glass that so clearly was telling me to steal it!",

We sat at the bar for a bachelor party but we couldn't get help. We noticed 4-5 bartenders all chatting and on their phones. We literally waved our arms to get any attention. At one point 3 of us wanted beer and we waved at a bartender and he went to the guy next to us because he knew him.   Overall, beer was great but no reason we need to flag bartenders away from their phones and group chats.",

I felt that $4.00 was a good value for IPA draft. I had the shaved beef with horseradish sandwich, which was ample size and tasty. Probably the best place to go before an event at T-mobile for a few quick drinks.",

I tried the burger and the pretzels, both of which were really good. I also had a beer, although I forgot the name of it, was very hoppy. They have a large selection of beer so you will have no problem a drink of your choice.  They also have large jenga sets and small jenga sets you can play with as you drink your beer and eat your meal. It kept us entertained for a while.  They also have live music at night, or at least on Saturday nights they do. It was enjoyable to listen to.  Very cool place to check out in you're in the Park Area of LV.",

There's plenty of seating around the bar, as well as some booths, high tops, and regular tables. There's also bench / picnic table seating outside. It's very open allowing you to see and hear all the action happening outside. The beer list is lengthy. They have a great variety of beers on draft, as well as in bottles and cans. They also have some wines and cocktails too. The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't too bad either. And there's a happy hour, live music, and lots of games (Jenga anyone?). If you want food, you can order some at a little window. Sometimes the bartender or sever will put in the food order for you. The service is meh. The food is eh. The beer is fab. (Note: Whenever there's a show at the arena, they nix their happy hour and any specials.) (Tip: This spot is more fun when there's not an event happening at the arena.)",

They have a decent selection of beers on tap  (about 30) with double that in bottles. They could stand to carry all of the las vegas local brews and not just a few of them. Same for the bottles, but still they have Devil's Milk and Delirium so I'm happy :)  The atmosphere makes it NOT feel like it's vegas, with the trees outside and the live music and natural lighting, I feel like I could be at the Grove in LA or somewhere in Baton Rouge. They have corn hole and Jenga for the table and larger versions that are awesome to watch in slow motion fall to pieces. They have wooden Connect 4 as well as ping pong, it's all tasteful is respectable of even the finest of bros.   Cafeteria style ordering, so no waiters at the tables, but honestly the liquid diet can work pretty good here ;)  Enjoy!",

We walked in after a walk at \"The Park\" and sat at the bar (since there was no hostess) we waited at the bar without any acknowledgement from the staff whatsoever. They seemed bothered for some reason? Anyhow, not our fault. We waited and never got asked anything. Shortly after, a couple arrived next to us and immediately got attended? Not only is that rude but unprofessional seeing as the bartender was right in front of us. We let that slide and waited a bit more and still did not get help! Not sure what their problem was but we left. Will not be coming back. Sad because it seems like a pretty decent place with good atmosphere. Customer service is everything.",

The menu is simple, which I like about the place. There is this weird ticket amount next to prices which I didn't understand and had to ask if cash/card was accepted, which it was. (I guess tickets can be bought from the cage lady, giving the place a carnival feel).   *Be warned that you can not order food from the bar and that the only alcohol at the food bar has is either Bud Light or a Citre. Kind of an odd concept having to wait in two different lines before being able to pick a seat.   The place is new so I'm sure they are still trying to figure things out but the line to order was long, waiting for the food took a while and there were plenty empty tables that just weren't cleaned up after with no waitress to be found. I'm sure once this place is open a little longer that they'll get it together.",

There were 2 entrances, one closer the the T Moblie arena and 1 next to Sake Rok ( I think that's what it was?)  it was hectic and a little confusing since it was right before the Guns n Roses concert, it was pretty packed and there was no host/ess stand to seat you so we just walked right in, past the bar until we ran into the other entrance.  There was a little counter where you can order your food get assigned a buzzer and sit anywhere you can find a seat.  The only catch about ordering at this \"window\" is that you can only order the beer they had on tap at that particular area.  This included Citra Rye, not your father's root beer and one other I forget.   We order a beerhaus brat and an order of beer cheese pretzels which came up to about $14.  We then had to head over to the bar to order our beers.  I grabbed a table and waited for our buzzer to go off while the beers were being ordered.  For the beers we went with a Founders and a chocolate churro stout.  The Chocolate Churro stout was really good, but they are only allowed to fill the cup up about 3/4 up for this particular beer.  The food was A-Ok, the beer list had a good variety but a little pricey at costing about $22 for 2 beers, but at least the food came out pretty quick!  The Ambiance at the Beerhaus would be great for big parties, there's plenty of long tables and lots of games that you can play, ping pong, foosball, shuffle board and Jenga!  *Negative star for no toilet paper covers in the woman's restroom.  Not that it was empty, but there was no spot for any toilet seat covers at all.",

And it's certainly not a patron's fault that you let in too many people! Just bananas that we waited for hours to get a table to have the kitchen closed on us. When we asked the manager what was going on, she physically pushed my friend. I recommend both locals and tourists avoid this place - it's never been good enough for the prices or the long waits.

I have that MGM-associated credit card that grants me free parking nearby when there isn't anything happening at T-Mobile Arena, so I had an easy stroll from the New York New York parking garage down an escalator, across a backstreet, and down the sidewalk. If you're not so fortunate, you may have to pay or consider free parking options such as at the Miracle Mile Shops (aka Planet Hollywood), followed by trams or lengthy walks.  Happy hour is 2-4pm daily here. We met up at 2pm sharp and were able to reap the benefits for as long as we could handle 'em. Select beers are $4 during happy hour, and I was surprised to learn that today's list was comprised solely of local options: the Las Vegas Lager by Big Dog's, the Amber by Sin City, the Gypsy Fade IPA by Tenaya Creek, and the Love Juice (a hazy IPA) by Lovelady. Of the two beers which I tried at Beerhaus, the Las Vegas Lager was actually far more flavorful despite filling the mass-market lager niche. The Sin City Amber felt lighter somehow and just wasn't very satisfying.  Although we had a server at our table for drinks, we had to trot over to the counter to order food. I tried a few of the happy hour bites (missing out on the not-as-shareable City Dog and Deviled Eggs), which were all priced at $5. The Loaded Tater Tots were my favorite, with crispy tots and plentiful cheese and sour cream. The bacon bits kinda necessitate fork usage, but that's fine. The Hand-Cut Fries and Beer Cheese had crispy but underseasoned fries with a creamy cheese dip, while the Fresh Chips and Onion Dip had very crispy chips with a nice onion dip.  I don't have much to say about event-day conditions or the entrees at Beerhaus, but happy hour was a great time. The service was timely and the A/C and TVs were functional, and the room felt spacious. I would felt comfortable returning for happy hour on non-event days if I were to receive another invitation to go.",

Located within distance of T-Mobile arena, New York New York, and Park MGM, it is a conveniently close to everything. You can come chill before going to a game or seeing a concert. There are plenty of seatings both inside and outside. There are a plethora of tvs if you are trying to watch any sports events going on. The outside have mist machines to cool you off from the scorching sun. There are games for those who want to challenge each other.   We came here for happy hour which is from 2pm-4pm. They offer $5 bites and $4 beers on selected items. We ordered the city dog, loaded tater tots, hand-cut fries and beer cheese. The city dog is good and comes with spicy mustard, Krauts, and relish. The loaded tater tots is amazing! It comes with cheese, bacon, and sour cream. The fries are good too.   Overall, I would come back here to try other food and drinks here. They have a wide selection from local breweries and have rotating taps.",

Order in the front counter for food and then find a seat and they bring you your food.  Table service is provided for drinks only.  They have jenga at most of the tables to keep you entertained if you don't want to watch any of their big screen TVs.

There was a good selection of places to watch the game, but we chose this place as the energy and vibe was great. We started off with a pulled pork sandwich that was very tender and delicious. The beer selection here is fair and they did have a few favorites and I decided on the Duet, from Alpine Brewing out of San Diego. Great beer!!!  We also tried their chicken wings that had a light, zesty buffalo sauce and tender chicken inside. Winner!!!   There were many TV's to watch the game and you could hear the goal horn 10 seconds before watching it on TV.  Pretty funny!!!    The only drawback with this place is the bright lights beaming from the ceiling that shined right into my eyes. Luckily, they were set on a timer and shut off about 20 minutes after the game started.   I think the draft beer list could use a bit of tweaking, but overall, a fun, high energy place to watch the game!!!",

They can hold many many dining and bar patrons or a fun atmosphere.    If you're there for food, there is a counter to place your order.  The menu is simple but they also offer vegan items for those with dietary specifications.  They give you a pager so the food runner can find whose order to deliver.  There is no need to go back up to the counter to retrieve it.   If it's drinks you're wanting, the abundant waitresses with happily take your drink orders from their expansive bar.    I ordered food this time and tried the bbq spit roast pork sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was a little dry and could've used more sauce but the meat did have a great flavor.  The side of fries were so full.  It was plenty for us to share and enjoy.    I think you might have better food options before a game but for a quick drink it's conveniently located in the strip action.",

The food was hot, burgers and sandwiches where a good size and everything was fresh.    Service = 4 stars.  The server was pleasant.   Pricing = 3 stars.  Overall a decent value but not cheap.  It's Vegas in New York New York.  Ambience = 3.5 stars.  Plenty of TVs and it was clean.  But seemed like it was kind of dead at 9pm.   The biggest downside is that you order at a counter, pay and then sit down.  I'd rank it higher if they waited on the tables which is what this place should be in my opinion.  If I wanted to order and sit I'd go to A fast food joint.   Overall, good food but a fast food feel.    Enjoy!",

Don't be surprised if some of your food is cold and other parts of your order are hot. They actually seemed to get our salad way warm (kinda gross) but the pork sandwich was cold by the time we got it. The City Dog was really good though.   Decent beer selection but spotty service. One time we were there last playoffs (June 2018) when my beloved Washington Capitals won the Cup in Vegas ( yeah!! Let's Go Caps!) the wait staff refused to take our drink order and actually told me it was because I was cheering for the opposition. Yeah well that doesn't help get me a beer or convince customers to come back. We did give it another go this time out and they served us. Shocker!!   It's just okay. Bar food and bar drinks for before your hockey game at T-Mobile Arena. It's convenient and that's why people hang out there and pregame. The food is meh and the service is hit or miss.

Inside Beerhaus, patrons were watching the live broadcast of it on TV and man, was this place loud and festive that night. Go Knights!  Do we wait to get seated? Hm, guess not. So we grabbed a couple of beer menus and found ourselves a table outside where it was cooler and a little quieter.   So basically, here's how it works. You order your drinks at the bar and take it to wherever you wanna sit. If you want food, there is another counter off to the side. Place your order there and they'll bring your grub to you.  I got the Beerhaus Brat. An IPA chedderwurst brat with smoked bacon and onion jam on it and a casing that had a nice snap to it! It was a great wiener! Lol! Happy now, Joycie?!  We also got some Fried Pickles and Handcut Fries with some Beer Cheese Dip too. Once again, good choices.  I came back a couple of days later to try the seasonal, Elysian Night Owl Pumpkin Ale that Kathy H. turned me on to, and hot damn! It's a great beer! This time I sat at the bar where the atmosphere was much different from a couple of nights prior. This is neither good or bad. Just sayin'.  Anyway, if you get the chance, I recommend you check this place out. Cheers!",

For drinks, we ordered a Coronado Guava Islander, Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, and a Banger Morning Joe.  I wasn't expecting much from their brats but when I bit down on that brat, it bit back. What a snap! I'm not saying the Golden Knights won because of me that night but I'm pretty sure I moved some tectonic plates when I bit down on that sausage and assisted the hockey puck into the goal a few good times. You're welcome, Knights. And those fries! They were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the beer cheese stayed gooey even after it cooled. I also enjoyed their fried pickles which came in spears instead of the usual chips. And being so close to the arena, I felt like working out too so I was lifting weights 12oz. at a time... in the form of a can of Corona Guava Islander. My waifu Sheryl M. was impressed by the amount of reps I was doing with that tasty beer, haha!  All in all, it was a nice bite at The Park, the faux New York setting bringing a beautiful ambiance. Beers and brats with my waifu any day!  Note: Sheryl M. likes wieners for dinner.  :D",

I ordered a roast beef sandwich which had an interesting horseradish coleslaw on it. It was a good sandwich. The French fries were excellent! I also love pickles, so I had to order the pickle basket. It had both sweet and dill pickles in it. Add a Sin City Amber to my order and it was $40.05! That's definitely a Vegas Strip Price for food! The fries are big enough to share between two people, so is the pickle basket. No, I won't share my beer. It was a hot day and we managed to find a table outside that was thankfully shaded by a large tree. This is a cool place to hang out. I really liked it here. It is just kind of expensive if you are on a budget, but every now and then, this  is a good one. I did post a photo of the menu and my receipt. I was charged $7.00 for both my pickle basket and my French fries, but the board and the menu both said they were $6.00. So unless they are recently changing the prices or up-charge during events, I was charged incorrectly. No, I didn't complain to anyone, it's just $2.00 and that's not going to make or break me.",

It was a bit confusing at first because you have to order your food from the counter and not from a server. The food was good and there are games such as jenga or connect four that you can play. The thing that bothered us the most was the service. We all have worked in a restaurant so we are more understanding. Our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. After she had dropped it off, she told us she would be going on break and would transfer our table to someone else. The new waiter later checked up on us maybe two more times. Then he never came back for a good 30 minutes. One of my friends even waved him down twice and he completely ignored him. All of our drinks were done and were contemplating on going to the bar to order. He finally came back when we ordered a round of drinks and shots. A little bit after he dropped off our drinks, he said he was closing out and would cash us out. We were figuring out how much we all owed and he was standing by our table waiting for us to finish. Basically rushing us. We gave him the bill and we didn't tip him over 15% because most of our bill was from that last order. Then he told one of my friends that he had to give him more and was pointing at the tip guideline on the bottom. He couldn't understand what he was trying to tell him especially with his Italian or Spanish accent. My other friend just gave him more money because he wanted to leave. But honestly, tipping isn't required and we were all shocked that he told us we had to give him more. Who knows how many other people he's done this to.",

Told to order food at the counter and beers from a server who can't take food orders. Order food and sit down but no server comes. Food is delivered, ask if I can order a beer from that person, they say no I have to order from a server. 15 minutes nobody comes. Same thing for table next to me - we are looking at each other like wtf. I go up and order from the bar. Finish my beer and still nobody. So I go up to the bar, ask for another and to close out my tab. They close it out for just the one beer. The guy walks away but they still have my card. Frustrated - have to flag down someone else for my card back. Maybe they were just off their game tonight.  I want to like the place. It was moderately busy when I was there - they weren't slammed and I saw staff walking around everywhere. I'll try it again and see.",

After tasting their pit roasted pork, I can see why. The bread was soft, but the pit roasted pork had very little flavor. The pork tasted like shredded boiled pork. We also had the sin city amber lager. The beer was average. What a waste of money. There are lots of options very close by. Will try Shake Shack (hamburgers) or Bruxie (chicken and waffles). Definitely won't be coming back. Service was horrible also. The waitress had a attitude, like we were more of a bother than a paying customer",

It was Monday night football so it was on every single tv...but someone reluctantly changed the tv at the back of the restaurant to watch the Giants/ Cubs NLDS game.  We ordered the pretzels and cheese, fries, brats, and one cobb salad.  The pretzels were great.  The fries seemed old and way to laden with grease.  You could tell they are frozen french fries.  If you want a refill...you must get it yourself..so every time any of us wanted a refill we had to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to get to their soda machines... i don't know why they don't move one of their 2 machines to the back... because it definitely isn't to discourage people filling water cups with drinks because they hand out the same cup for water and soda and beer.  The brats were ok and the pickles were good.  I was extremely disappointed in the cobb salad.  It was served in this little brown \"food truck\" boat but cost $10... a little expensive for an average salad.  Overall I felt like I was screaming across the table because it was so loud in there and I couldn't wait to leave.  It is cute that they have the games on the tables but it to me doesn't help with keeping up their food or drink sales... only one server walking around the whole place taking booze orders.  This place won't last long on the Las Vegas Strip...suited more for Downtown Las Vegas.",

We made our way to the bar, keep in mind they close at 1am, we were not greeted until after 15 minutes. Several of the bartenders and bar backs walked past us without greeting us, and we weren't greeted until we waived someone down. After finally ordering drinks, our bartender came back and STILL asked if we had decided on a beer when she had already served us. The bartender realized what she had asked and just followed with, \"oh my God I need to go to sleep\". After that, she said, \"by the way, this is last call\", which is ironic considering the fact we were never greeted and wasted 15 minutes of our time in which we could've ordered the food that we wanted. In that same interaction, we asked for our bill which was delivered immediately, and another bartender picked it up without me signing it. This made us feel incredibly rushed, even though she dropped it back off for me to sign. First time here, and the customer service that we experienced fucking sucks. If your bartender is tired, go home. Please teach your employees proper etiquette when it comes to welcoming your customers.   Update: Manage of Beerhaus left a kind comment, apologizing. I appreciate the apology, but how will you rectify the issue? This experience was truly awful.",

    "text": "Tourist Trap As a Vegas local, I know that many of the restaurants on the strip are about \"experiences\" more than food but this place is just trying way too hard.  If you're looking for an authentic beer garden feel, take the time to go to Hofbrauhaus on Paradise and Harmon.   My friends and I met here for dinner.  First off, parking is a pain and not free which for locals is akin to a smack in the face.  After dealing with Strip traffic the last thing you want to do is pay to park.   After being seated, we ordered beers from the extensive list of available brews.  The selection was good with both draft and bottles, but the prices were outrageous.  Our beers were $14 each!   While they have servers, they only serve you drinks at the table.  For food you have to order at a counter in the back and they give you a beeper.  When you're food is ready you have to come and get it.  And they had the nerve to have a tip bucket.   The food was okay but nothing special, I had a bratwurst and fries.  My friends had the chicken sandwich and pork sandwiches and they looked better.  All were served in a paper basket with plastic cutlery.  Interestingly enough, the brat and fries cost less than my one bottle of beer.  The red velvet moon pie for dessert was pretty good and not a bad price at $4. The beer here just isn't worth the price and the lack of actual service makes this someplace I'll avoid in the future.",

Perfect for first dates or group hangouts. There are fun little table games such as jenga and connect four. There's even a full size ping pong table inside. There's also outside seating with life size jenga to play. The location is great. It's on the strip but it's nicely tucked away in The Park near T-noble arena. Now, as I've said this is a biergarten so food is ordered on your own at the counter inside. Don't let this deter you from trying their sausages though. The food is tasty and fairly priced considering it's on the Strip. The servers are friendly are always willing to give you suggestions (Aggie was awesome!).",

We came during \"happy hour\" but of their Fifteen plus beers on tap, only one was available as a \"happy hour \" beer. NOT SO HAPPY!  The bartender must have had a lobotomy or something along those lines, as he was totally void of any personality whatsoever. He basically ignored his patrons, except for the two young girls sitting at the corner of the bar.  Now, normally I would start with the my review of the food, however I will start with the condiments, THERE ARE NONE! Unless you consider mustard, pepper, salt and Ketchup from an individual diminutive pouch! Condiments! Not A good optic!  Also, don't expect real utensils as everything is plastic! As for the food, the fare is limited and less than average. The Hot Dog was rudimentary and the sausage was bland! The roast beef sandwich was excellent  Will we go back? Probably not, unless we were pregaming for a Vegas Knights game!",

I spent a couple hours here and it was hard for me to leave; another go-to spot in Vegas!! Next time I'll get food :) Cheers!!  2nd visit (January 2018):  My latest visit to Beerhaus was not as pleasant as the first. The place wasn't crowded at all and I still had to wait for service. I ordered one brew and was debating on getting food. At first it was one bartender there and then another showed up (she checked on other people around the bar but not me). My glass was empty and I didn't think it would be that difficult to get another drink; wrong! The bartenders (both females) helped the people to my left and my right and then patrons on the other side of the bar before asking me if I \"was doing ok\". I ordered one more beer and then left; I was planning on chilling for a few and having some food; maybe next time :(  3rd Visit (August 2018)  This visit was a good experience, far better than my 2nd. The bartenders were attentive, as I didn't have to wait for a brew. It was during happy hour (best time to go) and I got food this time. Food was good, beer was cold, service was good; an overall good experience. No need to review again, this is on my \"go to\" list now.",

It doesn't feel like you're on the Strip at all, it's more like a separate entity, none of the street noise and the annoying tourist count is very low.   The beer selection is fantastic, as it should be with the word, \"Beer\" in their name; Hop Nuts, Banger, Crafthaus, Sin City, and Joseph James makes up the list of local brews along with a smattering of SoCal beers as well.   The service was good and the bartenders are very attentive, the but food ordering system is pretty ridiculous, follow me for a second...  - You can't order at the bar - You get up and order from separate window - Then you get a number and a flashy light beeper - The beeper goes off and you walk back to pick up your food  This process is so counter productive it's crazy, but thank goodness the food was good. I went with pretzels and fries and the seasoning was great and the pretzels were very soft and buttery. A beer lovers paradise.   I'll most likely comeback and try a few more things off the menu, while sipping a beer on the patio and playing some corn hole.   Das good, Beerhaus.",

We thought he would be right back to take our order. 10 minutes later we asked him if he could take our order. He said go up to counter and order and a waiter will bring it out to you. We waited in a long line. Got our order in. It was happy hour. $4 food items. Really good deal. BUT you have to go to another counter on the other side of restaurant for beer. Set up is weird. If youve never been here you don't know what to do.  Food arrived quickly. I got a hot dog and bacon wrapped dates. The dates were heavenly! Good quality hot dog. $4 each on the happy hour Menu. I would go again. Especially now that I know how it all works. The happy hour Menu has awesome prices for the strip. Conveniently close to T-Mobile arena. Love the  seating. It's long tables and multiple couples sit together. I love that and I love to talk. We had another couple sit with us and we struck up a conversation. Would love to give a 5 star but the waiter not giving us a better understanding of the place made me take it to 4 stars.",

They have a nice list of craft beer from local brewery's, as well as a rotating list of rarities.  Beerhaus is centrally located in The Park right next to the T Mobile arena, offering both indoor and outdoor seating.   We had so much fun playing board games and life sized Jenga. I was super impressed with the level of customer service. Taryn, our amazing server, was so much fun. She was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful with the beer list.   We ordered the French fries with beer cheese, and it was outstanding. In fact, it was probably my most favorite beer cheese of all time. I ordered the Tart mango cart by golden road off the rarities list. It did not disappoint. Tart Mango Cart is easily one of the most scrumptious fruit beers EVER. It was super delicious, and I would highly recommend getting it if they are offering it at the time of your visit. My husband got an excellent local beer from Craft Haus. NEEDLESS to say, we were both very pleased with our beer choices.   If you are a beer or fun lover, I would highly recommend checking this fun spot out. Be sure to ask for Taryn.  We will be back again, and again! Cheers",

We went on a weeknight right before they were closing so I think that's why the service was so very slow.

I love to enjoy the local beer wherever I go, being from Denver should explain that. I ordered a a beerhaus brat and a Banger Morning Joe. Both were fantastic! The brat was juicy and tender sitting on a poppy seed bun. I didn't think it was going to be enough food, but it definitely filled me up. The Banger brewery beer was great too! A light caramel hazelnut coffee kolsch. I would actually like to get some to keep at home, but not sure that they distribute here in Colorado. Great bar! The staff really know their stuff when it comes to beer, which is refreshing. Most of the time you go to a beer hall of some sort and the staff just read the description of the beer and think that is all there is to it. They all seem like they live and breathe beer. See some of you at GABF this year!!",

There were plenty of servers walking around, even waiting on tables right next to us and behind us, but no one came over to us. The whole time we were there!!!  And we had food and played games, and had 3 rounds of drinks that we went to the bar to get.  That was quite frustrating.       I have no idea why you would buy tickets to get drinks and food. They said it was easier than having cash, but who pays with cash anymore?  So the ticket deal was a mystery to me.      I don't know why the food is a separate window and self service. Ridiculous. I ordered the half chicken, and it was delicious, very juicy and flavorful. My husband got the pulled park, he didn't rave about it or complain. We had pretzel bites which were fine, the cheese sauce was tasty.      Being in the service business, it disappoints me when there is bad service. Las Vegas is built on service and gratuity. If it wasn't for the open atmosphere to Vegas this place would tank.          Beerhaus, all you have going for you is your location. Get it together.",

    "text": "I went here to meet my cousin whom I have never met.  I got there a bit early and had two beers while I waited.  It was my cousins 21st birthday.  When he arrived he was asked for ID, he gave his ID, which expired that day but he had his VALID STATE ISSUED DMV EXTENSION, they said they were not allowed to accept it, that is their policy.  Bullshit!  You refuse a valid ID?  I work in a casino and as long as the extension is valid we accept it.  Your policy is crap.  Just wanted to let you know I will not be going back.  No worries though, I know you don't give two fucks about what I just wrote.  We ended up going to Tom Urbans just around the corner, although your food is good and I was looking forward to the ribs, this place was awesome!!!  And they gave my cousin a free desert of his choice for his birthday!  AND THEY ACCEPTED THE EXTENSION!!  Be more than happy to give them another $200.  Bye Beerhaus",

Sit at the bar, as I didn't get happy hour anywhere else.  It wasn't super busy here (which I was seeking from 5-6pm).  Nice servers, yummy IPAs, and a slight outside breeze, so I didn't feel like I was in a casino cave.  Happy and may come back during my time in Vegas!   4/5 stars.....food was hotdogs and fries for HH.  I'm spoiled in Portland with good beer and food.",

    "text": "Give me a beer!  The all American beer garden, with a solid selection of rotating craft and well established old school brews and short but solid menu of rotisserie items and meat in a tube all housed in a faux industrial, open air space.  This could be any major American bar next to any pro ballpark.  High energy, and fun.  That said, WARNING, beer heats up fast when its 110 - 115 and you're seated outside.  Drink fast and drink water faster.  Just sayin'.  Simple bar food centered around the rotisserie.  From a juicy, porky, fatty in all the right way porchetta to a perfectly cooked, fall apart tender free ranged chicken to a moist to a messy pulled beef brisket sandwich with melted white cheddar and \"atomic\" horseradish slaw (you'll breath fire), all solid and all good eats.  Meat in a tube?  The IPA cheddar stuffed brat hits the spot.  Well seasoned, sweet porky flavor balances perfectly with the bitterness of the beer.  Smoked bacon and onion jam makes the flavors sing.    Do order the warm pretzels and beer cheese dip.  The pretzels are like tiny rolls and compliment any beer.  The trick is to use the cheese sauce as a dip for fries and dogs.  Hey, everything is better with cheese mixed with beer right?  As for the beer; 20 well chosen but identifiable selections of craft beers on tap, requisite Bud, Bud Lite, and an additional 60 bottles and cans both craft and from around the world.  Not the largest or most unique list on the Strip but still something for everyone.  Decent selection of local brews.  Prices are low for the Strip ($8 - $10 drafts).  Daily HH, 2pm - 6pm with $4 select drafts and bar bites.  Look for special events including tap takeovers.    Fun inebriation monitoring devices.  Table tennis, shuffle board, giant Jenga, connect four, corn hole; you know the more you drink, the worse you perform and the funnier the failure.  PARKING - No onsite parking.  Park at neighboring MGM properties and walk over.  Locals, it's not destination worthy yet but should fit well with the NHL expansion to the T-Mobile Arena.  Visitors, this is a perfect fit to The Park and an oasis of Americana seemingly miles away from the facade of the Strip.",

A live band was blaring Rolling Stones and ZZ Top tunes, so not great for conversations. And this second time I ordered a chili dog, while the wife and son both went with the wings and fries again. Not as good as take-out a few nights prior. And my chili dog could have used a bit more chili. But other then it being on the rather small side, it actually was very good with a lot of pop in each bite.",

The food menu is pretty limited with a few sandwiches, brats, pretzels and meat platters.  You order food and pick it up at the counter, but there are waitresses for the beer.  I had the chicken sandwich, which was pretty basic, but tasty.  Shredded chicken on a nice bun.  Added the fries with cheese dipping sauce, which was awesome.  They have the freestyle Coke machines where there are 100's of drink options with free refills.  And of course they have a nice selection of micro brews.  The restaurant is casual with tons of communal tables.  TV's are viewable from pretty much any seat.  Love the games set up throughout the bar.  Most tables have a Jenga set on them.  Outside the bar there are huge Jenga sets and cornhole boards.  They also have the mist sprays so you can sit outside and keep cool.  There was also some live music, but I wasn't really paying attention.  This place seems pretty chill for the Vegas strip.  I think it's may be more for locals going the the arena rather than tourists.",

The fries were pretty good as well; crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Also the beer selection did not have as many specially craft beers as I anticipated. So definitely don't expect a ton of variety.  The thing that bugged me the most was the service. After ordering our food at the cashier, we sat down at a table. It took about 10 mins for a waitress to come around to ask us if we wanted anything from the bar. My boyfriend ordered a bottled beer, which then took her 15 mins to bring back to us. By then we were almost halfway finished with our food. She asked if we wanted to keep our tab open or closed, we closed it, & she left us the beer check. It was not long after that we put down our card, but it took her FOREVER to pick up the check. Mind you that this place was not busy and our waitress was just standing around doing nothing. We left the check in clear view on the table but somehow she walked passed our table 5 times before picking it up.   It just amazed me how mindless she was and inattentive to our table, when the place was not even busy. I do admit that this was a one time thing and I can only say this occurred by one waitress so maybe everyone else is great, but this was just my experience that I had.",

If it was located walking distance from a college campus, I probably wouldn't, but the strip was in need of a place like this and I'm glad it's located in The Park.   The environment has a very pleasant, traditional, brewery type feel. The servers are attentive and friendly. My one complaint would be the ticket system. I wouldn't mind it, but it isn't explained well and a little confusing. At first glance I wasn't sure if I could pay with cash/credit, or if I was required to purchase tickets and then use those to make my purchase. But it seems like they are still figuring things out, being a new place.   We shared the pretzel sticks and beer cheese and of course a beer flight and a glass of wine. All were good. The beer cheese could use some work. It was a little on the melted Velveeta side then the homemade melted mix of cheeses and beer. But, I'll dip a pretzel stick in anything and probably still enjoy it.   The games that are scattered around the entire restaurant are such a great touch. Connect-4, Mini-shuffleboard, giant-Jenga, foosball, and Cornhole. People can plant themselves at a nearby table and play any of the games. You could spend an entire fun night at this place and not feel like you have to move to a different bar or restaurant. They have enough fun and ambiance for an entire evening.",

All in our group (25) were happy, the food was good and beer was cold, we couldn't have asked for a better place. Thank you Beerhaus!",

You have to order from some adjoining place that serves who-knows-what and carry it over to your table here at Beerhaus. Our server made no effort to hide her disdain for us after we learned we couldn;t order food from her. Maybe they need big signs out in front of the place instructing would-be patrons about the convoluted ordering process between getting food and drinks. There's a Putter's in town next to an Angelina's Pizza that has a similar separate ordering process for food and drinks, and I avoid that place like the plague, too. It's fine if you ONLY want to order beer and NO food. But for me, I paid $10 for my beer to seek our better service....and some FOOD!",

Note: if you want food, you have to order at the counter and pick it up when your buzzer goes off. There are a lot of games that would make this an entertaining bar for hanging out. I saw a photo booth, foosball, shuffle board, table tennis, in addition to a rack of board games and dominos.  It was crowded and I didn't stay long, so I'll just rate the items I tried. The warm pretzels with beer cheese ($4) were excellent. I actually preferred these pretty pretzels to a similar item at Culinary Dropout. To drink, I ordered a Paloma ($10.) It's on the menu as a draft cocktail, but the bartender had to shake the tequila and grapefruit juice by hand, so maybe that tap's not ready yet. The drink was mostly ice. I saw plenty of beer, but no cider on the menu. They were playing really great music during my short visit.  EDIT: less than two weeks after opening, pretzels were raised to $6 and cocktails to $12. They're trying to be family friendly because I see families with young children playing games at the outdoor seating area. I guess Beerhaus deserves three stars.",

I thought beer prices were a little high too but I found one on their specials menu for $4, a local IPA from Lovelady Brewing Co in Henderson which was tasty. Place is nice and has a lot of roll up doors so you have an outside inside kinda feel. Service was good. Will definitely go back.",

I also tried the pretzels and cheese which was yummy too.   When you walk into the restaurant, you order and pay at the counter. Once you sit down, a cocktail waitress comes to your tables for drinks. I think that's a very odd setup, that I haven't seen before. My two complaints were the chairs and the cocktail waitress. All of the chairs and tables are wooden, except for a row of booths along the wall. As for the cocktail waitress, she was the worst! When she first came to our table, my friend said she was going to pay for all the drinks, then began to order. She started with \"we are all going to have water...\" then the waitress started to walk away. Um, obviously that wasn't our complete order. We had to call her back. My other friend ordered a drink, then the waitress tried to leave again. Once again we had to stop her, so we could actually finish our order. She checked on us once.   For the service, I would have given this place 1 star but the food was good, so I had to give them more. This seems like a good place to hangout with friends, if you're not concerned about great service and if super loud music doesn't bother you. They have a big bar and board games available to play. Our table had a Jenga game on it when we sat down.",

I don't feel robbed after eating & drinking here, and it has a pretty fun atmosphere. And as icing on the cake, they have a bunch of Golden Knights stuff! Even a Golden Knights beer!  They have ribs on their menu, and we ended up coming back several times specifically to order them. They were falling off the bone, cooked perfectly, so delicious AND they didn't skimp on the serving size. Plenty big enough to split which makes it a great value! Their selection of beer is pretty impressive, and I wish I could have sampled more of it. Also if you're there to watch hockey, you feel right at home.   There were only a few things I didn't really like: First you have to bus your own table, no one waits on you. That's fine, most places in Portland are that way, and when it's not too crowded I don't mind. Second, I wanted to sample a few beers before ordering (since they're like 9 bucks or whatever) and they were out of a bunch of stuff I asked to sample - so I just ended up ordering an IPA I've had before and knew I liked. Maybe I'm just an unlucky picker, so hopefully that's not the norm. Last, the live music had a weird setup. It was a good volume for people who were there for the music, but if you wanted to get a quieter table (where you could actually talk to the people you're with) you're pretty hard pressed to find it. We ended up going outside to eat and were still screaming at each other to try and have a conversation.   Hopefully my review doesn't sound too negative because during my short trip to Vegas I ended up coming back here more than once and thoroughly enjoyed my experience and my food. Great little place!!!",

We were just far too tired to walk further to get something to eat before the Bruno Mars  Concert.   It costs $30 for two (small) hotdogs and a side of fries. It also costs about $35 for two alcoholic drinks (which seemed water downed). That's a total of $60 for very subpar food that wasn't even filling. Sigh. We should have just waited until we could go to Palace Station's Oyster Bar (we would have had two really yummy seafood pan roast for about $55). Double Sigh.  Although it makes me happy that this place has a pretty ok Vegan hotdog... I just couldn't justify the price. :/",

They have plenty of indoor & outdoor seating available; as well as picnic benches outside for big groups. They even have mist sprays over some of the tables for hot days.

Since the happy hour prices included $4 select draft beer, I wanted to know what selections were included. The bartender proceeded to mention that happy hour ended at 4pm. I thought really?!? She stated that the menu was wrong. With no attempt to rectify the situation, the bartender appeared to shrug us off. One of our friends wanted to get a coffee with Baileys, asked the bartender if she would be able to do it. The bartender stated that she didn't know if they had coffee. Really?!? What happened to customer service? Is it lost on the profusion of customers that come thru the door allowing for a nonchalant attitude.

    "text": "Guten tag von kinder! In honor of Oktoberfest I decided to finally get around to my review of Beerhaus and I have a Vegas trip shortly and I'm salivating at the chance to come back here and indulge my \"sausage tooth\" (some have a sweet tooth, but you can see I stray from the norm) Haha!  It's located in the heart of the ever blossoming Park between Monte Carlo and New York New York and it's quite nice just to sit and dabble in great food and not to mention people watch (always a hoot in Vegas)..What more could you ask for?  Their menu is pretty basic in nature with essentially finger foods (sandwiches, hot dogs, fries), but what stands out most is the quality behind the simplicity and it is the sprouting hormone free/antibiotic free touch that helps me fit into my lederhosen come this time of the year?!?  I wandered in late at night after passing this numerous times mainly because of people playing giant jenga and it really just looked like a good place to relax with amazing company and it sure delivered!  After perusing the menu, hands down there was no question when getting their Beerhaus brat..The bun is a small poppy seeded bun with just a hint of crisp, but was far from starchy and actually had a really nice flavor to it..there was a smoked bacon and onion jam on it which while a nice accompaniment I felt just wasn't necessary as the brat spoke for itself..Ahh yes, their unforgettable IPA cheddarwurst sausage..Cooked to tender perfection and had an A+ snap from beginning to end..I was in heaven as I mixed it with their beer cheese dip and kid you not when I finished it I was depressed, but could've eaten 20 of them..Haha! As a \"side\" I went with their hand-cut fries and that was another slam dunk..The potato didn't leave me feeling bloated from the starch and were the perfect mesh of crisp yet soft. I highly recommend!  In closing I can say if you're looking for some quick yet edible eats and treats a trip here will be well worth it..I'd certainly go on a limb and say it takes the phrase \"party in the Haus\" to a twisted yet euphoric new level!",

And I wanted to expand my tastes for different kinds of beer.  My god, I don't know if it's just that I have been eating very few meat or animal products lately (before this trip) or what, but this hot dog tasted like the best hot dog I had ever tried in my life. Well, ok, it was a braut - I don't really know the difference. (I ordered the Beerhaus Braut with added sauerkraut.)  It tasted like it had cheese inside, and was just insanely juicy and flavorful. The toppings also made it too - the jam and bacon. I was in heaven until I finished it and had food coma, haha. We also got the fries with the beer cheese dip. So good! I miss cheese :(  For beers, I don't know the extensively long names off the top of my head, but I have photos attached to this review. Mine was sour, and pretty good. Though I probably won't experiment with trying such an expensive beer next time, haha. My fiance got a different beer which he liked, and had a very weak taste - not hoppy like he expected. (We know absolutely nothing about beer.)  We really liked the food here, and the service was amazing too. The atmosphere is so casual as well. It was great!",

Her reply yeah I saw you but I'm busy . Tried to order some food only to find she didn't take the food order I had to go to the other side of the restaurant and order it myself. We had ordered some beer but then she saw me get up so she got a bigger attitude. My husband was still sitting I got up because she told me I had to order the food . As I replied you just told me I have to go to the other side of the room to order the food.  She settled down and went off to get the beer.  Personally I wouldn't come back but in fairness I will say the beers we ordered were good and the only saving grace",

They had a band playing who were honestly way too loud, to a point where you couldn't even have a conversation with anyone.  Inside we were helped immediately. Two beers were $24.00, I understand it's the strip so that wasn't frustrating. But the food you did have to go up and order yourself.

    "text": "We came here before the UFC fight to get food and a drink thinking (incorrectly) it would be cheaper than the food/drinks inside T-Mobile. You walk in and order your food \"McDonalds\" style. I liked that option (quick and easy and doesn't require a server finding their way to your table). Food came out fast and was very good, but incredibly small portions. A simple french dip sandwich was (if I remember correctly) $12.00. It was small and more of an appetizer than a meal. But it was a good sammich. So why two stars? One star is for the food and one is for the \"order before you go in\" model. We then found a table near the bar. The restaurant was pretty dead - I guess it doesn't draw the crowds for UFC that a game might. Lots of open tables. That said, we couldn't get a drink. Servers running around all over the place, no one stopping by our table to take a drink order. I stood at the bar for five minutes and was completely ignored by the bartenders (and the bar was not busy). By the time we found a server and ordered drinks we were in for sticker shock. A double vodka and soda was $22.00. The same drink (and actually more of a generous pour) in the arena was $4.00 cheaper. The food inside the arena was a huge plate of food and about the same price as Beerhaus. My advice when going to T-Mobile? Skip the horrible service and small portions at Beerhaus and just get your drink (and food) on inside the arena.",

The place was packed and the live band was great.   We ordered two hot links and a chili dog off the menu. The links were amazing, covered in onions and peppers. The chili dog was on point covered in a massive amount of chili,cheese and onions.   The overall time spent here was great. As we waited for our food we played Jenga and had a great time.",

    "text": "This is an interesting concept however I'd like to see a few more selections not so genaric. A monthly or bimonthly rotation of your selections would be great. But my biggest issue is your staff they don't care their attitudes stink and it showed when no one greeted me no one asked me if I'd like to see a beer menu NO ONE PAID ATTENTION. The final straw was being over looked multiple times by multiple staff members. I recommend your bar to hundreds of people everytime there is an event at TMobile Arena and even days when there isn't anything going on. PLEASE fix this.",

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful in your selection. It is NOT owned by INBev like the other down the road which sells their proprietary beers. This is place is located immediately behind the Monte Carlo in the Park and near the New York Casino. A definite place to check out and try. They have a small snack bar which sells  fries, pickles, chicken and bar food. They have goose ball, shuffle board, corn hole and other games to keep you occupied.",

This was my third time eating there in the past year, and the experience has been pretty consistent.  I've had their chicken sandwich a couple of times, and a brat the other time - all in all pretty good food.  I've also had their local pickle side dish - that was average, nothing really special.  They should consider sprucing it up a bit, maybe add other pickled vegetables to make it more interesting.  It's actually not that expensive, considering it's on the strip.  It has indoor and outdoor seating, some games you can play, and cute waitresses.  The one thing I would like to see is more beers on tap since the place is called, \"Beerhaus.\"    I'll definitely be back.",

Handcut fries were salted and good size but over cooked in too much grease, the chicken sandwich needed more arugula and crispy onions, and less mayo along with a smaller bun. The dessert \"Bye-Felicia\" was something I was looking forward to just because of the name! but a pre-made frozen ice cream sandwich needed time to thaw, and use better quality cookies and ice-cream.",

I'd give this a 4 1/2 if it were possible, as they could get a bit better.  Bartenders were quite knowledgeable and very friendly.  Comfortable bar that encourages interaction with the other out-of-town beer geeks that gather there.  Had Moody Chocolate Churro Beer out of Chicago, an incredible Banger Morning Joe (coffee kolsch) out of Vegas, and a Great Basin Outlaw milk stout our of Great Basin in Sparks.   Lots to choose from.  Spent parts of two afternoons there, which my lovely wife gambled.  Time well spent, and much less expensive that equivalent time spent gambling.",
