While I read that other places have better, I have to say that this place stands out because they actually have a veggie option. A veggie option with actual flavor!! It's spicy miso and not just a bland veggie broth like what most places offer (if they offer veggie at all). Also their green iced tea is great too. Staff is very attentive and everything is timely. I love it.",

Sometimes it is too far to go to Fukumimi on Trop and Eastern,and Omoide is solid.  The big negative is the lack of consistency in the cooks/chef's.  They take too long, harldy the same people each time I go, and for that I almost dropped it to a 3 star but the friendly service countered the slow cook times.",

The price is ok for what you get but I feel that charged too much for gratuity, their service was ok but I felt that they charged as too much for that and there was only 5 of us when we ate their..so that's for that.",

I actually like the decor and ambience. 5/5 score. The staff is 5/5, although she was by herself for 10mins(exluding kitchen staff). There were about 3 groups plus us, she did well in taking orders in a timely manner.  Now for the food : ) 3/5 we had the tempura mix. Nothing fancy about that. 3.5/5 for the ramen. I had the spicy tonkutso miso. I was a little worried when i saw it. I thought it'll be super spicy. Not at all. It might be 4/10 spice level. But the ramen itself is good except for the bamboo shoot. I fished it all out. Nasty! Please use fresh ones. My hubby ordered the regular tonkutso ramen, i tried it. Just ok. He said he had better. Now for the black sesame ice cream... yum-O! 5/5!!! Now, will i ever come back? Probably. If we're too lazy to go to chinatown.",

All noodles tasted not fully cooked and broth wasn't impressive. Service was pretty good but overall, we were disappointed. Because the place is so close to my house, we wanted to like the place and gave another try. Second time we went, it was packed but had only one server. Service was friendly but slow. At least noodles tasted better. Then finally the third time we went, the restaurant now seemed all in place and settled. Service was prompt, very friendly and attentive, and noodles were perfect texture. We ordered tonkotsu, spicy tonkotsu miso, ten zaru, gyoza and pumpkin croquette (i tried potato croquette before but pumpkin croquette was more flavorful) and all tasted very good. I was satisfied with food and service. So glad they have improved since they first opened and now met our expectations! I'm definitely going back!",

Like both restaurants, Omoide has a plain exterior and a beautifully decorated interior.  Unlike Soyo and Oyshi tho, I think Omoide needs some work on their food.  I ordered the Karaage chicken but it was a bit dry and tough to eat.  My friend ordered their cold soba noodles.  I normally don't like soba noodles since they tend to taste funny out here in Vegas whenever I've ordered, but his was surprisingly good. If they spend their time tweaking with the menu by specializing just a little more, I think Omoide could become a gem of a restaurant like her sisters Soyo and Oyshi.",

They were even extremely helpful with a Postmates order that got mixed up the other night. This place should have 5 stars. I travel frequently and have extremely high standards and this is by far one of my favorite places to eat period.",

The sign says \"noodles and bowls\" so not only do they have noodle soup, but also curry bowls, and poke bowls. They have a little bit of everything! 9-1 is happy hour, but one get one free beer. I'll definitely have to come back and try the rest! We came around 10 and the place was packed, definitely speaks to the restaurant.",

I ordered the Miso Tonkatsu Ramen while she got the Shoyu Tonkatsu Ramen. We both came into an agreement that our dishes were nothing to note home about. Flavor and portion was okay as well as the price range. It doesn't pack in much flavor compared to other noddle joints.   If I remember correctly their hot tea was rice tea and I enjoyed sipping on that through the cold night.  Our server was very attentive. She was also kind whenever we'd ask her questions, requests, and suggestions.",

Unfortunately, I'd have to say that the food was mediocre. Our table ordered 3 different curry bowls and the chicken were soggy. Taste was pretty good though. The miso soup that came with my entree was warm. I was looking forward to hot soup since the weather is nice and cold outside. My wife ordered Ramen. It wasn't bad at all but the nitomago was sub-par. It made the entire dish seem cheap and poorly put together. There is plenty of parking outside but it can get busy due to the other very popular restaurants in the same plaza. I probably won't be coming back here if I was craving some Japanese food.",

I had low expectations but even those were not met. I ordered the ten don and my friend got the chashu bowl.  The food came out very quickly, almost too quickly, like it was just sitting there. My friend and I were both disappointed by the small portions. I didn't enjoy anything in my bowl. The tempura was soggy and unappetizing and the rice was gummy. My friend was unimpressed with her meal as well.  Once we finished eating we both mentioned how we still felt a little hungry but didn't have any desire to order more food. She even discussed what she planned on reheating from her previous night's leftovers that she had at home...   I don't have any desire to return to Omoide.",

I found myself looking at the menu for around 10 minutes because everything looked so good and I wasn't sure what to choose! I'm sure it is a good thing though because it keeps you wanting to come back for more! The atmosphere was nice and the decorations were very intricate. They also had a very generous time allotted for their happy hour (9pm-1am, BOGO drinks). The food also did not disappoint at all. My girlfriend and I had a beef onigiri (sorry it's not pictured, we were too hungry!) and an order of takoyaki to start. For our dishes, I got the tonkotsu curry don and my girlfriend got the spicy tonkotsu ramen, which were both very good. The curry don was probably the best curry I've had at a place that doesn't specialize in curry. The ramen didn't have a strong tasting broth but it was still good! 10/10 would come back here to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "On the outside you may think this is a chain restaurant but don't be fooled.  This place is an authentic JAPANESE restaurant with amazing quality and variety.  A little hidden and secret place-- we loved this place so much my husband went on Wednesday this week and returned on Saturday.  Having visited Japan many times, we can spot an authentic Japanese restaurant-- not just one that caters to Americans with their offering of hundreds of rolls (with mozzarella and everything fried).  Prices are amazing-- like Happy Hour price but offered all the time.  AND amazingly enough, they offer 2 for 1 Beer and house Sake AFTER 7-- yep after NOT before.  First time on Thursday -  we ordered the garlic edamame (on point), tuna tataki (fresh and delicious with fried garlic on top) and the tonkotsu ramen.  It may sound like they may offer too many different items to be good but not so.  The Ramen was probably one of the best I've had here since I moved here 3 months ago and I have gone to specialty Ramen only places.  The broth was rich but light and the noodles were the right amount of chewiness.  The noodles tasted homemade.  The pork actually had a grilled quality to it that most other ramen places do not have.  Now, I know where to go to satisfy my ramen crave.  One of the best buys is the buns.  They are only $2.50 and they are huge.  We tried the Pork Katsu ones and the pork was so flavorful, crunchy and melted in your mouth.  It was so good we had to order one more.  This is a must try.  Tonight - Saturday night - we went back.  We started with the Avocado Salmon Salad and it was the bomb.  With a light Yuzu dressing, lots of fresh Salmon sashimi and generous avocado , it was a price steal at 8 bucks!  We also had the Black Cod and grilled squid.  We have been to premier yakatori places in Northern Ca and this squid was better than any I have ever had.  Delicious, fresh and tender-- definitely another must try!  The Miso Black Cod was also flavorful and tender -- yum!  We also tried the Udon-- again amazing light, flavorful broth and satisfyingly chewy fresh udon.  We met the Japanese chef, Nagasan.  He was so polite and friendly.  The service is also very friendly and helpful.  Kevin helped us with both visits. Go try this secret, hidden gem.  You won't be disappointed.  I promise!",

She did a fantastic job with serving, clearing tables, etc.  However, overall the food was okay nothing great.  Katsu curry was tasty but strong, katsudon was okay.  Gyoza was tasty. Big issue is cleanliness. Salt and pepper shakers and soy sauce plate were sticky and dirty.  Looks like cleanliness leaves something to,be desired.  With one waitress, how can she do everything and clean up too?  Also what looked like a counter for customers with utensils and napkins laid out has a curtain front of it but you can see supplies behind the curtain. Would hope they don't seat customers there, I wouldn't sit there and stare at a curtain while I'm eating.  So the place needs work definitely start with cleanliness.",

The broth and noodles I'd give a B+, but they need to work on their toppings.  The Chasu, egg, and everything was good, but the bamboo tasted like the canned type.  If your you're going to use canned bamboo then just don't.  Also, they put what appeared to be saffron on top as well.  They could do without that.  Just keep it simple and yummy.  No need to make it fancy. Over all I like this place, but it seems to have a polerizing effect on people.  People either love it or hate it.  Hopefully that keeps it from getting to Monta's crowd level.  I still think Monta is the best in town.",

Soba is cold noodle and dip it in special sauce , you know. Sauce is very important for this meal but this one's taste horrible and I felt they didn't make noodle fresh. Feel like they made noodle long time ago and save inside of refrigerator for next serving.  Not fresh at all. And small portion. Charge 11 dollars . No worth!!!",

To kick it up a notch we were served lovely pieces of pickled radish & cucumber in bright color. While the flavor stood on its own without extras, we added spicy chili oil for a drop of heat. It was delightful & reasonably priced making a filling & flavorful meal. The waitress was friendly, efficient, and helpful in suggesting popular meals. We also learned this franchise is from the same owners who have brought Oishe Sushi, Sparklings, and a few other great restaurants to this Southwest corner of Vegas. Keep up the great offerings! Total bill including 2 dinners, 1 large saki, tax & tip $34",

You get a big portion of appetizers and such for the price that you pay; but who wants a lot of a bad thing anyway? I had the ramen and I would say it was under par; if you want good ramen in Las Vegas, go to Monta Ramen.   My boyfriend had the steak don and it was dry and flavorless. The miso soup is obviously packaged as I actually eat the same brand at home so I'm certain on that.",

The 2 Ramen bowls I can't rate because it was for other people I treated and didn't eat with them. Pork is not my preferance so my con about this place is the lack of selection of Ramen since that's what I really wanted to try and have been wanting to ever since this dish craze.

As someone who loves cheese corn, I thought theirs was delicious. The ramen was pretty good too, with a good amount of spice (to me at least - I have a rather low spice tolerance). The service was good as well. Overall, I'm was very pleasantly surprised and I can't wait to visit again!",

I ordered the tempura udon, it tasted like it was missing something so I asked for a side of ponzu sauce and mmmmm it make it 500% better! The noodles was cooked very well and the shrimp tempura was yummy.   I wanted to try their Chicken Curry but didn't want to order a lot of. The great thing is they have these small orders (rice bowl size) for under $5. I added corn to make it more my type of a curry bowl. I would have to say, the curry flavor was really delicious. It wasn't too strong and didn't over power the whole dish. The bowl could have used a little more chicken but other than that, I recommend it.   The environment is pretty intimate. The chairs/tables are near one another so if your heading here on a date, it's nice but don't be shy with your conversations cause everyone will hear you lol  Enjoy!",

When I walk-in, I felt this whole traditional Japanese scenery like I'm in a movie where ninjas will pop out. What caught my eyes right away was the display of paper lanterns hanging on the ceiling. The restaurant's lighting is dim, so it gives that intimate feeling with your partner or your food if you like your privacy that way lol.  It also brings out the beauty in all the lanterns hung above. I also found the bar unique too! It looks like a traditional outdoor food cart.     After walking in, I was immediately seated and provided a menu. She brought out water without me requesting it, as it should be standard. She gave me some time to look at the menu and asked if I had any questions regarding. There item selections because it was my first time. She recommended a noodle bowl with a rice ball side order that compliments my main dish.      I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen Bowl $12, a beef rice ball and crab mix rice ball $5 (2 pcs). The orders came out quick and hot, leaving my wait time a satisfactory  She was also quick to provide the spices and sauces for my meal. Communication was there and her ability to see cues on the customers needs was great.     I would definitely like to come back and make this my \"go to spot\" because it offers so much more on the variety of noodle bowls along with the many amazing appetizers. The bonus for me was also the spacious and private seating and more tables compared to most noodle places, so I don't feel crammed here.",

I ordered vegetable tempura and it was not what I was expecting at all. They deep fried a leaf in which my brother ate and said tasted like pure oil.   I ordered the kake udon (udon with tempura flakes) and added an egg. When it got delivered, the tempura flakes were mushed and looked gross, the egg was also missing. When I mentioned the missing egg the waitress told me that what I ordered doesn't come with an egg. Which I knew and is why I ordered an add-on egg. When she brought the egg, it was really cold.   The gyoza & mini curry rice bowl was the best thing I had tonight.   When we gave the waitress our checks, (2 cards & 2 cash payments), I felt like it took longer than normal to get the checks back. When I first looked, our waitress was closing out our checks. When I looked the second time she was standing somewhere else talking to a customer when there was other servers around.   On the check, we were already charged tip. Not sure if it's mentioned on the menu for 6 or more people, it's possible I missed that. I was taken by surprise when I received my check though.",

Now, I can finally check mark it off my list. :]  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and I love how they stuck with the theme of an old town Japanese noodle vendor. It looks as though it has warped into a lil nook on the southwest side of town. The high ceiling makes the place look so open. And when you look up at all the hanging lights and decor, it makes you feel like you're stuck in a dream. Corny? Well, just trust me... and LOOK UP. ;]  The service was great and I have no complaints about the food or wait time. Their menu is really simple and they've broken it down to mini appetizers, ramen, hot/cold noodle dishes, poke bowls, and rice platters. I tried the Tonkatsu ramen and my friend had the Gyudon (See the menu on Yelp for pics and descriptions). Both were really good! The portions were just right for the price and the presentation of the meals were nothing fancy. We also ordered the Honey Bread for dessert and it was a nice lil treat to top off our meals.  Would I come back to this place? Yes, but only if I'll be in the area. There are a lot of equally great noodle/ramen houses as well as poke bowl restaurants all around Vegas, so they need to add just a little something extra to the menu to make me want to drive this far. But all in all, a nice lil stop for a simple meal. :]",

Ordered two appetizers: tofu steak and kimchi bun.  The kimchi bun was recommended by our server.  Took one bite and it was way too fishy and bun was stale and hard.  Told our server that we didn't care for it and to take it away.   Tofu steak was really good, loved the sauce and the bean sprouts.   Next, we ordered two entrees.  Spicy tonkotsu ramen and king tonkotsu.   After our appetizer, the ramen arrived. No tonkotsu.  Waited 5 minutes. No tonkotsu. Waitress noticed and said something about my entree coming right up.   Waited another ten minutes. Finally the king tonkotsu arrived explained to the server that my fiancee's ramen is now cold because we've waited 15 minutes for the tonkotsu to arrive. He said he'd tell our server.   She never showed up to the table until the end to drop the check.   The king tonkotsu was pretty good. Perhaps a bit over cooked, but it was absolutely enjoyable.   Got the bill and had to pay for the kimchi bun we sent back.   All in all, a terrible experience with slow inattentive service.  Too many places to eat in town. Will not be back.",

The decoration for Omoide definitely tops all the ramen places I've been to.  As far as food is concerned, this place isn't my go-to for ramen. Something about their base for the tonkotsu ramen is off to me. Out of all the ramen places I visit, their tonkotsu is my least favorite. The texture on the noodles aren't up to par with the other place I frequent either. I've also tried their takoyaki and it's alright to me.   Service here though is very good. You are always waited on very quickly, whether it be to ask how the food is or if drinks need to be refilled, they're on top of it. While this place isn't my favorite, some of my friends love this place and I can understand why.",

My favorite is bonito, or fish flakes. It's also a must to get the takoyaki!!  Every time I come here, I always order udon. I will either get shrimp tempura udon or kitsune udon. However, this time, I changed it up and ordered pork tonkatsu curry. A little spicy for my taste buds but regardless, it was amazing.  The place is aesthetically pleasing, so take pics of the ceiling lights. The entire restaurant is Japanese themed and it's cute af. I feel so at home when I'm eating there lmao",

We were actually on the way to another spot, and because I don't often find myself in this part of town, I just had to try.    Once inside, the center ceiling lights will catch your eye, then you look around and now find yourself outside a Japanese village. From the building designs on the wall, the windows decorated like awnings, and the seated-bar section like a street cart, the interior decor is beautifully crafted atmosphere.  Like the name says, they serve poke bowls and variations of Japanese noodles.  Today I'm having an appetizer with ramen.  Next time I need to try the poke, or even the udon or soba (which are two of my other favorite Japanese noodles, not found often in Vegas).    Karaage ($5.50) - Japanese-style fried chicken bites.  Great but a little thin on the fry imo.  Tonkotsu ($7.50) - a classic bowl which every ramen spot offers.  Omoide's version nails it.  Thin noodles, flavorful broth, no overwheming oil, and compared to other ramen joints, at a good price.  The end result was a delicious experience by means of a surprising stumble.  I'm glad I found this place.  When I'm back in the area, I want to go straight to Omoide.",

    "text": "FINALLY! What I consider as a bowl of noodles in a noodle shop. I ordered noodles in pork broth, with a small side of plain white rice. I had my spices on the side so I could make them spicy to taste. The bowl of noodles came in a giant noodle bowl, with pork that had been rolled, and tied, seared, and slice into slim round disks. There was a boiled egg half open faced, some other yummy vegetables, and a small sheet of seaweed, which I like very much. The broth was brown and looked like someone had poured a little milk into it, which of course, they hadn't. I used the small bowl of plain white rice to cleanse my pallet every now and then so I could enjoy that, \"first bite\" feeling throughout the meal. I had tried a noodle shop in Hawaii, but I couldn't eat it. I had to get my money back and leave. I've ordered many bowls of noodles since then, and this place finally had what I was looking for. The noodles were a little softer and bigger. Good flavor. Most noodles in a shop I can't tell the difference between those and the little 20 cent dried squares you get at Walmart. These were better. The broth was delicious. I slurped down the whole giant bowl, one little spoonful at a time. It was a very satisfying experience. And, at $9.50, I thought it was a bargain. I'm getting over a cold, so I needed me a good hot bowl of salty, spicy noodles to slide down my poor throat, and this was very rewarding! I will eat there on a regular basis. Every time I'm in the mood for a bowl of noodles.",

The tempura batter was light and crisp. The decor is a industrial japanese vibe, which something new and cool. I'm definitely coming back to try more of the menu!",

    "text": "So the other day, I went to check out a nice ramen noodle shop called Omoide off of south Rainbow and Robindale for lunch. I do like the fact that it is pretty close to my work......but what about everything else?  THE DECOR (4 out of 5) It was pretty nice walking into this new restaurant. Lots of seating and really high vaulted ceilings made it feel really spacious. That and a lot of Japanese touches (even Japanese ads) that made it feel kind of fun.  THE SERVICE (4 out of 5) Pretty good service from the wait staff here. Didn't really have to wait too long to get our food and refills on my water were plentiful.  THE FOOD (4 out of 5) So, let's get down to it, shall we? I had ordered an app of their karaage (think Japanese fried chicken nuggets) which was pretty good although, I kind of like the karaage from Fukumimi better. And then I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen (like I usually get from Monta) and it was pretty good too. The veggies and the pork chashu were good, but as far as the flavor of the actual ramen broth, I really prefer Monta's ramen broth instead. Maybe it's because I'm a big salt kind of guy, I dunno. The good part though for Omoide is that they have a lot of stuff on the menu like udon or soba noodles (both hold and cold), katsu don, etc. So, I'm looking forward to trying out their other dishes.  *UPDATE* I went to Omoide for lunch again last week and had the Tonkatsu Curry Don, which was really good.   OVERALL (4 out of 5) So, if you're in the Southwest part of town and are looking for some good eats, be sure to check out Omoide. However, if you're looking for the best ramen out there and don't mind waiting, then Monta or Monta Chaya (in my opinion) are where you should go.",

We have so many great ramen places in Vegas anyway.",

The chashu was really chewy and tough compared to the melt in your mouth chashu I usually get in ramen and the tonkotsu broth was a little on the thin side.   Still, a pretty decent meal and establishment overall.",

And I'm sure maybe some of the other menu items could be better than what we ordered... So my broth was bland in flavor and the meat was really tough and undercooked. The server knew nothing of the menu and could only say what she liked and what was popular. I'd ask questions like how is the meat prepared, do u have spicy dishes you could recommend, basic menu questions that she should've known the answer to. I mean it was my first time there and was not familiar with their menu. I'd like to say I'd give it another chance but I'd rather try other places since there's SO MANY restaurants to choose from. Cute place though!",

I was too excited to have the curry so I skipped the miso. The salad was light and had a great flavor. The curry was a medium spice which was perfect to me. I don't like overly spicy, I feel it hides the flavors of the food.  Miso Ramen: My husband had this and loved it. I might get it next time but I loved the curry so much I'm not sure.  [DECOR] Very cute. Has the feel of outdoor japan, with pretty multilevel lanterns overhead showcasing their vaulted ceiling.  [SERVICE] Upon emptying my water glass it took less than 30 seconds for them to notice and offer a refill. Nice. The servers were very attentive and friendly. Lots of smiles here.  [PRICE] Great price. My curry was $11.50 and the ramen was about $10. They charge extra for eggs and green onion which is normal. The quality of the food + the environment makes this place a steal. I will be back. Yum!",

It didn't taste special or anything. The Tonkatsu sauce was already on the meat which made it soggy. I recommend asking for the sauce in the side. The miso soup was one of the worst I've ever tasted, mostly because it tasted like hot water.   On the upside, we ordered the Buta shio buttkake and it's amazing! In fact, we loved it so much that we ordered a side of noodles to add to the broth. The sesame ice cream was also one of the best I've ever tasted. I'll definitely get a scoop every time I go.   We wanted to start with the gyoza but the waitress forgot to ring it in, I guess. We didn't feel like eating it anymore.

My only complaint is that the ramen bowls don't come with egg. You'll have to pay an extra $1.50 for an egg. On the otherhand the bowls are reasonably priced.  There is also a great selection of appetizers and dons (rice bowls) if you're not feeling ramen.",

I had one of my friend's gyoza and sampled the Spicy Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen.   Chicken Karaage was decent but I would have liked more seasoning. I hate to say this but I was really disappointed in my udon. The broth was too light & thin and had a weird, indescribable taste to it. I couldn't figure out what was in it or what was missing. I didn't care for the udon consistency either. I prefer the noodles to be chewy, soft, and thick. Sadly, I've had better $1 udon from the market. My husband said his ramen was just OK.  The service was good and the food came out in a reasonable manner. I didn't finish my udon and thought of driving to a fast-food joint after but decided to eat dessert at home instead. I'm not sure if I would return to try the other items. I'll read the reviews and see how things pan out.",

This restaurant is lovely, with a succinct menu featuring a handful of apps, noodle combos, and bowls. They serve Ramune soda, which is a plus. We started with the typical apps - tempura and karagge. Both were very good. My cold soba with tempura was fantastic. You can't go wrong with soba on a hot day.   You'll probably bump into me at a corner table on the regular. I'll be the one with 4 orders of tempura apps and soba noodles.",

Environment: The inside is clean and ventilation is great, no smell from the kitchen at all, especially no frying oil smell.  Service: Very good. We were acknowledged and seated immediately. Menu and water was provided before the server walked away to another table. The food came out quickly and our server came back numerous times to clear off emptied dishes, refilled our drinks, and made sure everything was fine.  Food: We ordered, Gyoza, Cold Tofu, Potato Croquette, Edamame, Kitsune (Bean curd Udon), and Buta Shio Bukkake (Pork belly Soba). Potato Croquette was fried perfectly, crispy and doesn't fall apart. Kitsune, the noodles were great. Soft yet chewy, just like udon should be. The soup, however, was a little saltier than it should be for this dish. Buta Shio Bukkake, the Soba was made perfectly and sauce was good too. I must say, the pork belly was made very very good, crispy with lots of flavor.  We will definitely be back to try other things on the menu. Donburi (rice bowl)next.",

We were treated nicely by the young kids running the place.   We started out with Pan fired dumpling and the our chosen dishes that I previously mentioned. The shrimp tempura came in quickly. However I had to wait 10-15 minutes before my Ramen was delivered.   Tempura shrimp with curry was alright. Lacked proper breaking and the curry was too thick.  Ramen broth was nice but expect very small amount of noodles, so order extra noodles if u are hungry. Dumpling were good, same as other places.   Overall it a good place to get ramen in south west if you don't want to drive to Chinatown. But I'd rather go to Sora or Tonkotsu Kiyoshi for my Japanese fix.",

The decor is so adorable with Japanese accents. The restaurant only had a few patrons when we arrived, but my daughter spotted a couple of seats at their bar, so that's where we enjoyed our first Omoide meal. :)  Menus were \"served\" on clipboards.  Extensive menu for a little place!  I had a hard time deciding what to order, but being that it was an unusually cold day in May, I knew I wanted a hot bowl of noodles!  Although I was excited to try the ramen, I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Udon and my daughter ordered the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen (I knew she would be able to spare a few bites for me to try their ramen noodles as well).  We also had the garlic edamame appetizer.  Everything was really delicious and plated (bowled) beautifully!  Our soup was not super hot which was a little disappointing, but not enough for us to send it back. We ate it anyway and honestly we were both very happy (and full) with our meal!    Of course their service was a little scattered, which is expected of a new restaurant on only its second day of business, but I'll be back to check them out after they've had more time to get used to their own menu + perfect their service.   Nonetheless, EXCITED to have a solid noodle option a few blocks from my house. Woohoo!",

    "text": "First of all, I am really excited that there is finally a ramen place here in the Southwest! So when we saw that this place opened, we tried it right away.   I learned that \"omoide\" means \"memories, recollections\" in Japanese which is reflected well within the interior of this ramen place. The design reminds me of a street in Japan where you find a random ramen spot and discover that it's a diamond in the rough. It is very well-lit (love the paper lanterns!) and spacious. I like that the windows are big letting more light into the place. Most ramen places make it so that their interiors are dark.  It makes me feel a little claustrophobic sometimes. The ambiance inside Omoide is homey and comforting.   The food here is decent. Not the best. It is hard not to compare it to Monta Choya. Their broth for their ramen is pretty bland. I think that is a good thing. It is refreshing to have a ramen place where you can control how salty you want your broth to be.  The portions are big so you get your money's worth.   Overall, this is still a pretty good ramen place. They are new so there is always room for improvement.",

The atmosphere and decor was very cool, made to look like you're in Japan. Restaurants these days are becoming very creative I must say. I ordered the Spicy tonkatsu and the boyfriend ordered the pork katsu bowl. Overall, I'd say the ramen was medicore,  no where near as full bodied and flavorful as Monta Ramen. The Katsu was fairly good, and came with miso soup and salad. Service was good as well. Wasn't wowed by this place but  not bad.",

My favorite by far is the car just because I can munch on something and not feel like I'm full and taste delicious. We been here quite a few times and will be returning we haven't tried much on the menu but they all look great and customer service is on point",

I don't know what possessed me  to pull over and try this restaurant out ....ok, it was the cool looking building and a sign that said \"Noodles\", but I'm absolutely glad I did!  I went in there with miso ramen in mind. As I was looking over the menu, I came across this Gyu Don. The picture looked familiar, so I read the description . It said 'thinly sliced beef with onions in a sweet soy sauce over rice.' Say wuut!?!? Naturally, I ordered it and OMG!!! It hit home! It reminded me of the beef bowl from yoshinoya but way, way better!!! I was totally in heaven! Sprinkled some of that red pepper and it was bomb.   For appetizer I had this chasu bun thing. Looked like a taco but with bread. Very tasty!   I had to give it 4 stars because as much as I liked the gyudon, I can't justify paying 9 bucks for it. Maybe if they lowered the price to $7, I'd be down to go back and get more, but as of now, I got my fix and I'm good.",

It seems to be partially steamed and partially fried. The best part of it is the shredded green onions on top, it really makes it taste better.   The last time we were there, they gave us a free bowl of udon noodle soup with what appeared to be tempura crumbles in it. The broth tasted like agedashi tofu. It was very thoughtful of them and delicious.   Their ramen is ok, but that's the least of my worries because I know this is not a complete \"ramen spot\"   They also have curry dishes that are always good. My favorite is their mini chicken curry bowl. Although the chicken is not crispy, it's still the perfect portion for a quick snack to enjoy with your other dishes.   They also have a buy one get one drink special at certain times for those of you that like sake or beer.",

I fed my whole family and I for under 40 bucks and it was honestly the best ramen I've had in country.   The spicy needs to be kicked up a notch however with the chili oil and red powder at your table you can go as hot as you need. Also I recommend ordering extra noodle if you're hungry or want to share. It will cost you three dollars for twice the food!   The lunch box is also a great value so if you can capitalize on that it will help your wallet.   The staff is very helpful as well so if you are new to ramen houses (I envy you) don't feel intimidated or dumb for asking questions about what is what they are there to help you and they do.   My family and I will most definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!",

The servers were nice. I love their business hours, and huge but not too big menu choice with great pictures and brief descriptions.  Let's not forget about the food !!! I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious ! I just wish it was spicier. We also had the beef tataki,  perfectly seared and red in the center in a delicious citrus-y ponzu sauce garnished with fried garlic chips and red onions ! The tuna tataki was alike except the sauce was thicker and spicier, less citrus-y if I remember right. The miso blackened cod was so tender and sweet and so delicious, only question about it is it's small portion compared to the picture in the menu ! Last but not least, the grilled squid was great as well ! Even though it didnt have a sauce on it, it was still deliciously flavored and yummy.   Our bill rang up about $60 for four, what a steal ! The prices on their items are affordable ! Cant wait to come back and try more of their delicious food !",

The place was pretty empty aside from two parties. We were a party of 6. Tables are small and so are the spaces between the tables on the floor of the dining room. If it were a full house, I could see it getting right for people to walk through or around.  The room is lined with a few booths which I thought looked cute.  Didn't need to use the restroom but my kids and husband did. The husband said the restroom was gross, which is too bad since the dining area looked nice.  Got our menus and water right away, it took a while for the server to come back to us to get our orders. I think she was the only one. I was disappointed to hear that it would take an hour to get the spicy tan tan ramen I wanted, so I ordered a regular one. My kid got a tonkatsu bowl and we were disappointed again to see that the portion was so small. We tried to order a side of tonkatsu alone but they wouldn't let us do that. They said the register didn't have that option. I'm sure they could've put it in as a miscellaneous charge and write a note somewhere.  We thought it was funny how all of the cooked foods came out before the poke bowl.  Refills on our water kept coming till business picked up a little. Then when we ordered our dessert, Honey Toast, no one came to clear the table so we piled everything up on the ends. Even as they served us our desert and dropped off the check, our used dishes still took up space at the ends and our glasses never refilled despite there being another server on the floor besides the one when we first arrived.  Food was good but not so good/unique that I'll be craving for it. I like that they have a big selection of items and they even have a eating challenge too. I wish I go to taste the spicy broth.  Don't think I'll be back, but will probably recommend to anyone who lives on this side and loves ramen.",

How is this not the hottest place this side of the Pacific Ocean??   I guess it's tucked away and kept a little secret but not for long. It's too good not to try.",

My husband has been on a search for good tonkotsu, and we are happy to say this place filled his needs! I cannot speak for him, but the chashu was tender, broth was perfect and came with thin noodles as it should (according to him).  My tendon came with 3 shrimps, nasu, shishito, kabocha (pumpkin) and a perfect hanjyuku-tamago (egg)!!  It was a double thumbs up for not only having potato croquette but also having pumpkin croquette!! Oh, and Orion beer of course.   Their interior is amazing, and almost reminded us of a yatai, and gives the ambiance of sitting outdoor.  Clean overall, and the staff was extremely lovely with the smiles. :)   We hope to come back this week!!!",

    "text": "Short version of this review: If I can give zero star, I would. Please don't waste your time and money to come here. Long version of this review: I made a yelp account just to write this review. This is the worst taste I've ever had in a restaurant. I ordered Spicy Tonkotsu Miso Ramen, the broth tastes decent but the bamboo shoots taste horrible and smells gross. They don't taste fresh, they taste like canned bamboo shoots you can buy at China Town. The thing that upsets me most was the Buta Shio Bukkake. My girlfriend ordered it and it was nothing but udon noodles in clear soup with three extremely thin slices of burned grill pork and three sticks of green onion. The soup tastes like boiled water with oil and burned smells, and the worst thing is that it costs $9! I will attach pictures at the end of the review. It was so bad that I had to ask the server to take it back. The restaurant let me order something else instead. I ordered Chicken Karage Don, which tastes blahhh at best. The chicken tastes so bland and the miso soup that came with it tastes horrible. The tofu in the miso soup tastes like it hasn't been washed prior to cooking. I don't understand how they can serve food that tastes so bad to customers and charge this price. It's ridiculous. Overall, definitely avoid this restaurant at all costs if you don't want to ruin your appetite and waste your time and money. I would not even eat the food there again even for free.",

Environment: with plenty of room and vaulted ceilings the environment is very nice.  2. Service: I didn't request for a lot and I don't have complaints 3. Soup base: I actually like the soup here more. The flavor of the Tonkotsu was more subtle and not as overbearing with the salt.  4. Noodles: It tastes store bought, nothing special.  5. Chashu pork: Compared to Monta, unremarkable. It was a bit course and flavorless in comparison.  6. Price: 1 bowl of Ramen with 2 toppings was $11  Overall, I will come back again. It's a good lunch spot on this side of town.",

First, service took FOREVER. And I'm not exaggerating. A couple seated next to us, left because their dishes were taking too long as well. Anyways, it took them twenty minutes to give us our first ramen dish. And I had to wait an additional fifteen minutes for my pork belly miso bowl to arrive. And lastly, the gyoza came after another five or so minutes. And there was no communication between the servers at all. We got the bill twice at the end of our meal.   If the service wasn't bad enough, the food was below mediocre. The broth for the miso ramen tasted like it came from powder. The so-called udon noodles looked and tasted like hydrated ramen noodles. Both bowls were oily as well.   Definitely NEVER going back. Drive to Monta or Sora instead!!!!",

I had a karaage bowl and my husband had tonkotsu ramen. Their ramen is surprisingly good! It isn't salty like majority of ramen places. To our disappointment, karaage was just o.k. Nothing beats the original we have back in Japan. The chicken was very dry and lacking flavor.   Food took a while to get to us but the guy who served us was very quick and attentive! I love the atmosphere! It felt like we were on the streets of Japan. Definitely coming back and recommending this place to friends and family.   Finally! We won't have to drive all the way to Spring Mountain to get good ramen. Hopefully our future visits here will be just as good.",

So it's hard to judge the quality of food based on an easy dish. I guess I'll say it was acceptable. Service: Servers were polite and there were no long waiting periods. Menu: OMG There are so many different types of Japanese food on this menu I wonder what they can handle it.  One order could be ramen and the next could be a katsudon. The cook(s) have to be really talented to switch gears like that. Finally, I found several misspellings on the menu.  I addressed it to the server and he said he will pass it along to the manager.

Instead it's roomy, properly decorated, staff is very nice and the food is solid. Can't go wrong with the ramen here. Very good, and the waitress took her time to go over the menu and explain it to us. That to me goes a very long way. According to some of the reviews, they must've had a bumpy start when they first opened (\"waited this long for my menu\", or \"this long for my food\" god forbid that happens on a grand opening! Pfft) but they are on point right now. I'll be back again for sure.",

    "text": "First off I want to say how happy I am for such a great ramen place to be so close to home.   As soon as you walk in you'll notice the detailed decor. It's super cute and very well planned out. It reminds me of a little Japanese village you might see illustrated in a book or in a old Japanese film. It's not just the counter seating but if you look up you will see the lanterns and the set up they have in the nooks of the walls.   Then there's the food. I love most things spicy so when I first came I ordered the spicy tonkatsu miso ramen with an egg even though you have to order it separately, I gotta have an egg. Lol That was delicious and now here for the second time I couldn't wait to have it again. It's not spicy to where you can't enjoy your meal. It's just the right amount of spice, because they know that's why you ordered it. I love the noodles, always soft and just the right size. The toppings in the ramen are what make the broth more flavorful. As you eat you can taste all the different things but at the same time nothing over powers another. We also tried the umeboshi Onigiri, which is pickled plum inside a rice ball. This brought me back to my grandmother. Being raised in a Japanese house, when we were sick we were given umeboshi Onigiri and tea, it brought back memories. We also ordered the gyoza, honestly it's nothing to be excited about. It's a fried pot sticker, something I feel you can make at home.   My overall feel for this place is amazing. Love, love, love it!! The waitresses are super nice and very friendly. Always making sure everything is alright and filling up your cup. Brought my brother back this time only for him to love it too. I will continue to be coming back and bringing more people.",

Ok, the squid was alright, grilled and no seasoning to it. The chicken karaage was a little off. Especially the breading. I guess that's their take on it.

I got the tonkotsu ramen and the flavor of the broth was very hearty and delicious. I liked that they include the bamboo in their ramen dish unlike some other ramen spots in Vegas. Whenever I've had ramen in Japan the bamboo shoots always came with. Also the chashu was very tender as well. I forgot to ask for an egg with my ramen though, didn't realize it didn't come with one. Oh well.   Service was excellent.  Happy hour drink specials were fun with the buy one, get one free beer and house sake special and the ramen was delish.

You can order 3 different kinds of fish for the same price, and if you want even more it's only $2 extra. The tuna tataki was amazing with a little garlic, cilantro and spicy sauce. They even have sashimi. Lunch specials are an even better deal. The service is awesome, the atmosphere is cozy and chillaxed, and there's always customers but it never seems crowded. There's a lot of poke joints around LV but I don't know how it could get much better. Everyone is always super friendly and you never wait long for food.  I just started on the Whole 30 diet, and the menu here is super friendly to that. They have a pretty extensive menu that I haven't even started to explore yet, so I'm looking forward to that journey. And best of all, they stay open til 1 am if I get a jones for a big bowl of delicious fish. It's a 15 minute drive and I would make that trip 3 times a week because the food is so good. Check it out, you'll definitely come back for a second, third and fourth visit.",

Came in on a Sunday at about 2:15 pm Amd it is nearly empty in this very good sized noodle shop with plenty of tables and space.    B.  Service - very nice and attentive staff. Friendly and quick.  C.  Choices. Love this menu.  From the rice dishes, to the noodles, ramen, soba and udon.  Both hot and cold noodles. They even have my favorite Zaru Soba noodles as well.  D.  The food. This is key and three star to me.   A.  Buta Shio Bukkake Cold Soba- of course I love soba and cold is best.  I first want to know where were the noodles?  They gave me a huge bowl and a small bit of soba.  The soba was perfectly cooked.  Enjoyed it quite a bit.  The grilled pork belly was well very grilled. I found it to be tough and the taste was not flavorful.  The sauce was strong.  Very strong taste.  I know they use Mirin for the sauce but it was over powering.   B. Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen- my son ordered this and I had a few bites.  The sauce was very good, ramen just right.  My only issue is that the ramen was swimming in soup and I prefer that it is not.  C.  Hiyashi Chuka - these cold ramen noodles are very good and on a nice warm day just right.  Right amount of ramen and all the toppings were great.  The wifey ordered this and of course I stole some bites.  I look forward to ordering this in future.    I like this place, the size, the service.  The food could be slightly improved but  it it is good overall.  GK says check it out.",

Went here for dinner around 5pm, I was having cravings for some curry. I ordered the Ton Katsu Curry Don, it was about $10. Came with Miso soup and a side of salad with the combo, Not bad for a full meal. The chicken cutlet was crispy, and the curry sauce was tasty. I was still amazed with the ambience of this place. This restuarant is located where I call \"little Chinatown\" next to Oyhsi on Rainbow Blvd Rd.   Will come back again to try many more of their items like their karaage chicken plate. Will recommend to my friends looking for a quick bite of curry, they won't disappoint. Service was decent but never gave me a bad experience.",

OK traditional matcha tea is a whole different story...... Lol (4/5)  I got their onigiri as an app... It looked pretty... But the flavor was non existent. The daikon was salty salty salty...(2/5) but it helped the onigiri that was bland bland bland....:/ together they were OK... But the crab mix just had no flavor and the rice was overcooked so that it was on the mushy side and I'm sorry but who wants mushy rice in their onigiri?? (2/5)  I also got their tonkatsu shoyu.... And I know that shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce.... But still there should have been more balance in flavor. It was just salty salty salty. I'm seeing a trend here. Too much salt and not enough other flavors. It was not balanced at all. Did I eat it? Yes I did.... I was starving. :/ but did I enjoy it... Sadly no....:(   Service was ok seeing as how I was the only person there. :) but I still had to ask her for a refill on my tea (4/5)  Ambiance.... It was cute. Same layout as when it was Rice Traxx but better decorations! :) (5/5)  Will I return... Most likely no... I would rather drive to Jinya or to other ramen places in the Chinatown area.",

    "text": "This was genuinely a go to the spot for me. I couldn't even count the amount of people that I've introduced to this place, it'd be hard to calculate the hundreds (plural) of dollars I spent at this place overtime. Last night, both myself and my coworker were very disappointed.  It's almost religious I order the same thing at this place (The only exception is when I'm feeling dangerous and order a honey bread for dessert). It's always Ramen and a side order of shrimp tempura. The shrimp comes in a set of two for three dollars and while I'm personally not the biggest fan of the price, I pay it anyway every time because I just happen to love shrimp tempura. Last night, however... When I received my order, it was noticeably smaller to both myself and my coworker who comes with me all the time.   Seriously, if you look at my last review, it was five stars and I'm pretty sure I even mentioned it was arguably my favorite restaurant. Not anymore. I brought it to the waiter's attention upon delivery and he scoffed at me and said \"they always come in this size.\" They don't... They seriously don't. If I was cheap and just trying to get free things, I would've complained that there is some hair in my soup or something. I've never complained here before in the countless times I've been here, i've always been polite to everybody. I've always been easy to please.   This is the one time (over a three dollar item) that I had ever spoken up about anything and I was argued with and scoffed at. I didn't even ask for them for free, I just wanted them exchanged for some regular sized shrimp if I was going to pay the three dollars I always pay for it. That type of guest service put enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I have become fairly confident I'm never going to come here again. This was a bill over $40 (including tip, because I'm not an animal) you would think more effort would have been placed forward to retain a VERY loyal guest's business but instead they are now trained to argue baby shrimps till their death.",

Which were good.   The food though is a whole other story. The noodles were done right. Their soup doesn't have that umami flavor.. It's missing quite a lot. I wouldn't come here for their noodles.   IMO, their Chasu don bowl is probably the only I would come there for. The rice was just right paired with the sauce of the Chasu and pickled plum and radishes. Their rice bowls come with salad and miso soup. Their salad were sprinkled with a dash of yuzu to give it a citrus-y flavor.   The black sesame ice cream was just what was needed to make the meal feel complete. But overall,  I left feeling full but unsatisfied, the noodles lacked a lot of flavor and umami.",

Beef tataki didn't stand out. Didn't get any sweetness or aroma from the garlic chips. The beef lacked savoriness, which made the acid stand our a bit much. The corn cheese was also okay. A bit of sweetness from the corn, but the cheese didn't impart any addition. The buta shio soba didn't really add up either. The soba was great, the pepper puree was great, even the grilled pork was great. The broth however was a little funky and didn't impart much. Two things that did stand out, however, were the chashu bowl and the croquette. The chashu bowl was melt in your mouth great. With the addition of umeboshi, the bowl left a satisfying feeling. The croquette was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside (get this).  For dessert, get the black sesame ice cream. It was good.  Overall: Okay. Wouldn't go back anytime soon though.",

    "text": "Another good option for ramen in southwest Vegas.  It seemed as if Omoide gives you a very easy-going ramen experience.  The bowls seem bigger, more noodles, and tons of toppings.  Surprisingly big chunks of chasu which is nice as Vegas seems to be on the skinnier side when it comes to the meat.  The spicy broth actually delivered a good heat throughout the course, perhaps taking some of the Korean influence from the area with a gochujang-esque accompanied spicy sauce in the bowl.  My filling bowl came to $11 after tax.  In and out in less than 45 minutes. Omoide is a fine option for ramen in the Valley.  But don't overlook the huge menu with tons of rice and noodle options if you're not in the ramen mood.",

We asked to see the menu to see where the mistake was and right under the Beef Steak Don it says Beef Short Rib. He asked if we wanted to switch it out for something else and I end up ordering Tempura bowl. 5 mins later he comes back with another disappointment.. they just dumped and cleaned the fryer.

After our experience here, I think I've created little foodie monster children lol. They are so blunt and hey, kids keeps it real!  I had no influence in their opinions, yet I always encourage kindness. But my unfiltered 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter had the most funniest facial reactions to their \"ramen\".   \"Mommy, the noodles are so hard.\" \"Eww what kind of soup is this?\" (Miso and shoyu base) \"Mommy, you tricked us, you said they'd have Ramen.\"  \"Can we never come back here again?\"  I had to keep shushing them because other customers were looking our way. My husband tried their Ramen and agreed. My 11 year old son, however, enjoyed his grilled chicken wings. The other two little kiddos asked if they can have potstickers because they couldn't eat anymore soup. After encouraging them to eat more, I did order some potstickers, and my hungry little monsters gobbled up the two orders.  I enjoyed my salmon sashimi and plain rice onigiri. In fact, I had hubby pick some up for me to-go another night since the kids were so adamant about not wanting to eat here ever again lol.  3 stars for the good service we had, the grilled wings, potstickers, and salmon sashimi. Not a great choice for Ramen.",

What could have been a major faux up actually helped to define a level of customer service people now closely associate with the luxury car company.  Our first visit to Omoide was kinda like that. Although it was laden with way too many silly mistakes for a super slow lunch (food delivered to wrong table, missing orders, etc.), their level of attentiveness and speed in fixing our orders thereafter saved them from a far far worse review . . . the food also helped out a little.  I had the spicy tonkotsu with extra chasu: good broth, decent amount of heat, okay noodles, and good chasu.  The wife had the veggie miso with extra corn: tasty veggie broth and a good amount of greens and things.  Now I'm not saying Omoide is anyway like the Lexus of ramen.  All I am hoping for is that the ramen stays tasty and that next time we go things will go more smoothly.",

    "text": "Been here twice for lunch, and I just gotta say their lunch special deal is a STEAL! $12 for noodles, rice, and a drink!  On my first visit, I had the lunch special with tonkotsu shoyu ramen, curry bowl, and an iced green tea. The ramen was quite yummy: the noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soggy yet not too hard; the chashu had a lot of flavor; and I had a nice helping of green onions to go with it. I'm not really a fan of the big piece of seaweed in my ramen, so I didn't really care for it. The curry don was your normal japanese curry with rice; nothing too special. Finally, the iced green tea. Let's just say it was so watered down it seems like I was drinking green-colored water. At least it was free with the lunch special. Lol.  My second visit I had the shrimp tempura udon, the chashu don, and a hot green tea. Warning: don't expect to get the thick udon noodles you're used to. Think the  thinner dry instant udon noodles you can buy at the supermarket. Also, they literally dunk your shrimp tempura in the broth, so by the time it gets to the table, there is no crisp to the tempura anymore; just soggy tempura wrapped shrimp. I didn't really care for the udon. Next was the chashu don. The sauce of the chashu gets soaked into the rice and it just makes it SO much better. Let's just say the chashu don more than made up for the disappointing udon. I practically licked the bowl clean and wanted seconds! As for the hot green tea, let's just say I was letting it cool before drinking it. About 10 minutes later, the waitress came and switched it for a new steaming hot green tea! I was like, \"Uh... I was waiting for it to cool before drinking it.\"... I guess +1 for above and beyond customer service? LOL!  I'll definitely be returning again just for the chashu don. :)",

It was good even though I put way too much chili oil in it. The server was extremely nice & gave me more broth to add to my bowl because there was no way I could eat it that spicy.

Maybe I got the only non english speaking one.",

My experience was not great and neither was the experience of my companions - there was a foul sewer smell filtering in inside of the restaurant and we waited what seemed like forever for our ramen soups (it had to be around 30 mins or more) do not worth the wait - not as flavorful as I have had at other ramen joints. When we asked why it's taking so long, the servers said they are backed up in the kitchen which there were only two- three tables of 2-3 people. The rice bowls two our companions ordered came out in decent time. One a good thing was the salmon sashimi was fresh. Unfortunately I will not be dining here again!!!!",

We walked in and were seated quickly but everything went downhill from here. It took a few minutes just to be acknowledged and drink orders taken. I ordered a udon bowl and the wifey ordered a donkatsu plate. After waiting an eternity my food finally came out first. It didn't just taste like instant udon but I think this is what they were really serving. Flavorless, soggy shrimp tempura, and one small fish cake. I finished my food and my wife never got hers. I asked the waitress if her food was on its way and she apologized and said she would check on it. She didn't give us an update and came back 10 minutes later with the food. When we were done it was another unacceptable wait to request and receive the check. It was a crappy experience overall and we won't be back to this place.",

    "text": "We were debating over a few places and we're driving by on Veterans Day Monday before stopping here. I had read the mixed reviews but decided some hot soup and noodles would hit the spot on this chilly day. My husband wanted to take it to go, but when I tried to order the lunch special, she said it was for dine in only. So instead, I ordered the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen and Mini Charsui Bowl for the same price (sans the drink). We were told it would be 10 minutes. That was at 12:07pm. A few people who had come in after us had gotten food, and every time they would walk by, their eyes would glaze right past us, not realizing we had been sitting there while others were getting served. At 12:27 I asked the girl go check on our order as it had been 20 minutes which they said it would be 10. They went to the kitchen and mumbled something and said they were packing it up and we would be next. 12:38. We got our food at 12:38. A mini apology but nothing to assuage the situation or make amends. That was my first disappointment. This food had better make up for the poor service we had already received. I poured the noodles and such into a giant bowl and poured the soup over it. I figured after a little time the noodles would soften and I would have a beautiful, aromatic, meal to make my mouth and stomach happy. To my chagrin the noodles stayed in the shape of the styrofoam they had packed it in. I had to microwave the whole thing to get it to loosen up. Even then, it was...well meh. Nothing horrible but definitely not worth waiting 30 minutes for. The mini charsiu bowl, on the other hand, was delightful. It was packed full of flavor and the meat was tender and melted in my mouth.  However, overall, it was a meal meant to be forgotten. While I shall not forget the Veterans who served and thus gave me a day off of work, I shall easily forget this lackluster meal I regrettably paid for.",

It's basically three times the size of the pork cutlet and a heaping bowl of rice and salad!! Try at your own risk!

If you're a newbie to Omoide, and have a craving for curry late at night, definitely try their ton katsu curry don. The pork cutlets melt in your mouth! A delicious surprise for me as it reminded me of a closed establishment years ago that had a similar dish (however I couldn't find any place that served it anywhere in Vegas for the life of me). Not until stepping into this quaint little joint.   Ton Katsu Curry Don consists of a generous amount of pork cutlets, white rice that consistently doesn't get too sticky or hard in texture, slices of red ginger, and a less than wholesome amount of curry sauce all over. It always comes with a soup and salad, whether you order dine in or to go.    Apparently they have tonkotsu ramen with black garlic oil (but only limited to one specific ramen), which I tried briefly with a few friends however flavorful it may be, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Their late night Japanese beer specials are definitely noteworthy though!",

Oddly, our tonkotsu came out before our sake and appetizer... but no big deal.  We then had to ask twice for at least the hot sake to come out.  When the sake finally came out, we then had to ask for our appetizer.    When our beef tataki finally came out, it was nothing like the pictures.  We received some thick sliced COOKED beef.  Tataki is supposed to be thin sliced raw beef.  We had asked our server about it and she simply said that it's always cooked to medium, shrugged, and then left.  I don't think that she even sensed that we were dissatisfied about the plate that we received.   Oh well.",

It is suffice to say that our expectations were exceeded!   Despite the fact that it was a Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of open seats. Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted and assigned to a seat. The menu holds so many options, whether you're feeling ramen or Japanese curry or appetizers or cold noodles. Its wide variety made me question my decision because everything looked so good (and I wasn't even hungry).   The pricing is ridiculously good. Although we only ordered two mini dishes and an appetizer, we were filled up and the total ended up being lower than a fast food meal. There's no chicken option for the curry so I opted for a mini chicken curry bowl. It's pretty good sized and it was only $4! My boyfriend ordered the chasu bowl and a karage and was super satisfied with his meal as well.   Our waiter was super attentive and knowledgeable too. He continuously checked up on us and filled out water cups. It's definitely a win-win when the service and food quality mirrors one another! To top of it off, there's a great ambiance and I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner! We definitely see ourselves returning in the near future.",

We all love it!  Outside is a crowded strip mall, inside is an escape. Dark wooden raised booths, multiple floor table seating for both small and larger groups, super friendly staff every time and food is great!  Lunch specials are perfect.   GMonkey do:  TONKOTSU Combo- ramen, mini chashu, salad, soda = $12 TONKOTSU Combo- ramen, mini curry, salad, soda = $12 KING TONKATSU CHALLENGE- 3 Gigantic slabs as big as large oval plate, ramen bowl of rice & miso soup-sized bowl of sauce(asked for aside). Finish all in 20mins = FREE!  Do try a regular-sized plate. It's still of generous sized meat, rice and salad!    Losers to challenge (like me), pay $30 for lunch and dinner for next 3 days. Though I may not order Tonkatsu for next few weeks, it is still one of best we've ever had. Crunchy, lean, hot, thick slabs of meat, breaded and fried to perfection!    Ramen is delicious on its own, but paired with a mini bowl of another entree you may be curious about + salad + drink for $12!  What a deal!  Cannot  wait til next visit to try other items.

Corn cheese- very different,  not a pleasant different, more like I would not order it again. Toss salad was ok Charsui bun- I would not order again Don't get me wrong, I am not saying it's bad. The flavors were just not to my liking.  Food presentation was great.  Outside- very clean, strip mall, lots of parking. Lots of light  Inside-small, cute,  I don't like the chairs. Lanterns hanging down are nice, inside decor is nice Service-good Prices- good Over all, I don't think I would come back. But this place seems like if you have the taste buds for this place then it would be rock'n. The food just made me miss all the great food at home (Hawaii)",

As I look around the restaurant this very moment I count 14 children eating here and the loud music keeps dropping f-bombs over and over. I kindly asked if they would skip the track but they wouldn't. Same story last week. Is it really that important to management to have profanity playing in the restaurant during lunch time when families are here? I get it if it's the late night or happy hour crowd, but during the day I don't see why they can't play the same songs with the profanity taken out. So this will be our last visit as a family.

They were doused in a whole stick of butter - completely inedible! We had to send them back.  When our server presented our check he apologized for the mushrooms and offered Mochi ice cream \"on the house.\" While we appreciated the gesture, what we didn't understand is why he wouldn't remove the mushrooms from our check. Why would we pay for something we were unable to eat!? 2 stars because the Tofu steak was quite good and I'm hoping this was just an \"off\" night.

The Service and is wonderful and the place was decorated nicely! My friend and I had the tonkatsu curry don, chicken karaage don and the potato korokke . They were good, not stand out fantastic, but got the job done.  Best part was the happy hour special they had, where the Sake was buy one get one free.

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with my lunch special. The broth for me just lacked flavor or any kind or depth. My normal go to spots the Tonkatsu Ramen feel more heavier broth unlike one here is water down and lacked any kind of depth or distinct flavor. The toppings get nice amount like any other Ramen spot in Vegas. Ramen it starts and ends with the broth. Unfortunately did not work for me. Next time I will try order Shoyu broth. The Curry Bowl that was five star experience!! It Japanese style brown curry. Right off the back my favorite style curry. It delivered on point! I just wished ordered bigger bowl. =( I love the fact even for side dish for the lunch special not skimpy came to the portion size. The curry has nice amount of chicken and vegetables in it. The house salad that came with the lunch special was good. I enjoyed the vinaigrette style dressing on it. LUNCH special talk about steal of deal. $12 there no way can go wrong in life. Bowl of noodles, choice side, and drink plus house salad. I know plan on coming back again just for the lunch special and more curry bowl action.  The decor is pretty cool. Thinking for small restaurant off the strip in tiny strip shopping mall Omoide had tons tons of personality. Right from the moment you walk in with the Ramen Bar set up if by yourself great spot get your noodles on. The cool lights and the Japanese advertisement with everything in Japanese. Definitely nothing like you would think from the outside. The service was five star they were awesome explaining everything being first timer and going over the lunch special cause talk about options. Not just lunch specials the regular menu has nice diversity.",

If I am going to spend money, I really want to make sure it's something I'm totally excited about forking over the dough.    I was really looking forward to this place opening up and had high expectations....darn it.     Don't get me wrong,  the service was great and my server was very kind and helpful,  but the food was just not a hit for me.  I'm going to try and give this place another try and hope and cross my fingers I find their magical dish that will make me return.",

It tasted funny and wasn't impressive. Noodles were ehh, soup was ehh and toppings were even a bigger Ehh! All in all don't come here for the Ramen it was just Ehh.   On the other hand my wife and I thought that the chicken Karaang and the Goyoza was delicious! The chicken was crispy and juicy and with the dipping sauce it was sweet and yummy. The goyoza was very flavorful and tasted really fresh, I can eat a hundred of them little sucker. Seared to a perfect crispiness on the outside and cooked with a great meaty inside.   Let's just say I happy that this place is cool and it's in the neighborhood but I will not be running back here especially for the prices.",

Such as tonkatsu don, onigiri with crab and a potato croquette. All which were so delicious I got already full with eating the onigiri and croquette I had to take some of my tonkatsu don home lol. The restaurant environment is very chill. Whenever I visit it is barely busy but definitely enjoyable to have some quality time with family and friends. The service was pretty good so I definitely recommend trying it out if you're in the mood for some ramen, rice bowls, appetizers and much more !",

They were a relatively new spot on the block. the biggest gripe I had at that time was that there was not enough noodles in the soups. Well, they fixed that!   I had the Pumpkin Croquette as an appetizer again and it was just as I remembered. It is a crunchy tempera style pumpkin cake with a dipping sauce.  Then I had the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with egg and he had the Miso Tonkotsu Ramen. Trust me the Spicy Tonkotsu tastes much better than it sounds. They have a spicy version and a regular Miso Tonkotsu for those that don't want to drink a lot of water with their soup. I've heard other's say it isn't spicy - well then they must have also changed that. It was spicy this time around.  It was a pleasant experience. I am always happy when I return to find things have improved. They have increased in a star - 4 stars now!",

The kind one should be listening using a headset or played at a rave party. Not a place to take children, family, aunts, uncle, grandparents, or even discuss respectable business. Regardless if a restaurant is $ or $$$$, background music should not be inappropriate. The content of lyrics played during a late lunch with my 12 yr olds twins were obscene, indecent and profane. The owner should have a sign on the door about their inappropriate music so children or anyone  who wishes not to be an audience to this type of surrounding can opt out. This place seem to be overpowered by a group of young careless inadequate staff. Is it recommendable? I wouldn't put my name recommending this place, there plenty ramen places that are worth earning your business like Ramen Kobo on Durango/215.",

    "text": "Cute exterior menu board and interior decor, so I really wanted to like this place! It's trying to be what people expect Tokyo to be like, but just an FYI, it's not actually...which would totally be ok if the authenticity in flavors was there... The menu had good options, but I'm afraid our lunch didn't live up to my expectations. The karaage wasn't seasoned enough - there needs to be more salt and maybe a crispier batter (higher cooking temp fryer so it's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and if we're trying to avoid over salting, there should be condiments on the side (salt and pepper) on the table, but there wasn't...or at least offered on the side (there was curry powder and a mayo/soy sauce on the side instead...maybe chili pepper could've been an option?). The onigiri fell short also, the rice was overcooked (wet), and the ume filling was ok - but for the price I wouldn't typically point this out as a fault except that the rest of the meal wasn't that tasty either. Then my miso ramen - it wasn't hot (maybe the bowls should be warmed prior to serving? Because it was room temp when it got to the table), the ramen noodle was different, and slightly overcooked. The miso base itself was rather bland and more orange in color than I typically have, so maybe it was a different miso base?  Overall everything was ok, and the best way to explain it is that all the flavors are mild. Other notes - it bothered me that multiple tables brought on outside drinks, and no one said anything (as in, 1 table had Starbucks, another had raising canes, but maybe it's just that casual?)...and when our apps came out, there were no utensils/napkins/plates? We had to wait for each of our entrees to come out for them to bring each setting (since mine came out first, I had chopsticks, but my companion had to wait for their ramen to eat the app!). Finally, no one stopped by to touch our table (server or manager) to see how we were doing until I was waiting for a check and the server saw how my ramen was not touched much, as I just didn't care for it any more than an instant ramen I can make at home. If you're in the area and want a quick bite/fast food, this may definitely be the place for you! But I think you're might be better off going to Chinatown for a better meal at the same price, and if you like stronger flavors/temperature-appropriate meals.",

I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu lunch special, with an order of Gyoza, and a iced green tea.  The bowl was amazing!  The mushroomy broth was so good I drank out of the bowl what I couldn't get with the spoon.  The ramen was cooked perfectly, and the little mushrooms were very good as well.  The Pork Chashu bowl on the side was a very pleasant surprise, and was bursting with flavor.  It was like little slices of pork belly that fall apart in your mouth with a gingery soy flavor, which seeps through to the rice underneath.  The little salad that came with the dish was light and tasty as well.  Speaking to the customer service, I ordered a second lunch combo for my son who was going to meet me there, and because my son was late, the staff was kind enough to offer to make a new dish for him so that it would be nice and hot when he arrived, which was very much appreciated.  I will DEFINITELY recommend Omoide to friends, and I will also be back again soon.",

We got disappointed on our favorite karaage chicken, it used to be very lightly fried with thin breading skin, chicken itself isn't salty at all, but still tasty, right now they claimed they used some new thick breading outside of chicken, it's also super salty, I do not like it at all, I cannot believe someone pass this decision, it was the most horrible decision they've ever made.  2. after being disappointed by karaage chicken, we have to find something else now..so we gave their pork bun a try.....it's good, except the pork I got in my pork bun was literally PAPER THIN with mostly breading and almost no meat, I'm not joking guys, I compare my pork meat with the picture on their menu, which looks just like a generous thick cut, it looks NOTHING like it at all, when I talked to waitress they just politely apologize, although I didn't expect them to give me money back....but...not even effort of remaking me a new one? wow, there goes another star  after these 2 times....I'm sad to say that they have loose two loyal customer(more customers, because I will not recommend my friend to go there anymore).  Good bye omoide, time to go back to good old Sora and Monta :(",

Anyways, we were instantly greeted with a smile and got a table in the corner like we wanted. The menu is very simple. There were some things on the menu that I needed a translator for. The waitress kindly and patiently told us what we wanted to know. We opted for the rice ball things - one with beef in it and the other with crab in it. Both very good and remind me of Korea - the triangular rice ball? that you eat on the train or bus, sam kak kim bab lol We also got the potato croquettes - oh my gosh sooo goooood. I love potatoes and these croquettes were plump, hot, and oh so potatoey! For the noodle selection, I got the tonkatsu miso ramen and the boofran got tonkatsu shoyu ramen. They were both good but I think I prefer the flavor and broth at Jinya better. I would definitely come back again though, the appetizers are hella good. They also have don bowls or whatever that I would like to try next time.",

Technically you're not suppose to do that because the owner is very traditional Japanese and doesn't like to mess with how the food it actually suppose to taste but since my boyfriend ordered ramen the server just added the side of corn to his order. I liked the fact that it's a both ramen & also rice bowl kind of place. On top of that it's on the SW side of town. So much more convenient than driving across town. Our server was very attentive & the restaurant look very traditional & clean. I also found out through our server that omoide means dreams / memories. I like that!",

I just needed the fat cut off of it cause that how I enjoy it. Almost always ended up ordering that if I couldn't make up my mind. I guess the cook had a problem with it cause he took the time to chit chat with the servers at the front and mention my order like it was a big deal. Then as he walked back to the back passing me we made eye contact clearly letting clearly letting him know that I heard him.  I'm a 5'9\" 235lbs 36\" waist Marine Corps Veteran with 4 deployments I can honestly say a lil bit of PTSD kicked in which almost led me to flip the table and stay a scene but I'm too old for that stuff.. so here I am typing away like a keyboard warrior because the other route would have most likely ended me up somewhere I don't need to be. Trust me I'm not proud of this.  I sure hope the restaurant handles the situation with the cooks ignorance. Other then that The food is amazing and the place is clean. 3 stars though.. would've been 5 for sure.",

So one night I put in a to-go order and the curry from the tonkatsu curry don was forgotten.   People make mistakes and this happens, nevertheless what happens next is the reason why I will never go back.   I did not call up the restaurant for I was not going to go back after a long day at work but I called 2 days later and told the girl who took the new order over the phone what had happened.   She apologized and this was not her fault for she was not there when it happened.  But her actions is what loses me as a customer forever.   I show up to the restaurant for my new order and I ask her can I speak to the manager and she says that is she.  She then tells me that she does not see any notes about it.   I told her over the phone that I did not call it in that night for I was not going to come back to the restaurant for the curry after a long day.   She then says that she can double check the order to see that the curry is there this time or give me extra curry.   ARE YOU KIDDING ME?   First of all, you don't trust me enough to give me the $12 tonkatsu curry don and if you are the manager, you should easily be able to give me the credit for it.   Keep your good food, but your handling of the situation is what lost me forever.  Very very sad and angry on how this was handled.   My 2-3x a week eating here is by no means of an exageration either.",

The broth is better and the noodles aren't the thick udon noodles I've had at sushi and other Japanese restaurants. I like that you can add extras like wakame and fishcake (or tempura among other things).  I'm also a fan of the umeboshi nigiri, which if you're from Hawaii is basically a musubi with ume in it. I don't see this on a lot of menus and although it's a very simple item, I love it! Probably because it reminds me of home.  I'm glad I gave this place another chance. It was worth it!",

I love this place, I love their food, always good service, but today was horrible! the server who are working opening sheet today, she was so rude! why she shift responsibility on the customer? she keep charge for her mistake even we said several time when we placed an order. she seems she don't have any knowledge about menu and common sense at all!  I asked to my husband to call them to make an order and pick up. He keep saying Not a ton katsu-don, we want to only ton katsu! but she can't understand. I thought she barely understand English.  Anyway when my husband pick the order, she give him donkatsu-don, so my husband explain about we want donkatsu, not a donkatsu-don. and guess what she saying? \"Next time say order king tonkatus\".  and we have to pay for tonkatsu-don too. It was her mistake I can't still understand why we have to pay for their mistake? and why this restaurant owner hire that kind of stupid server? If she are under training that the reason why she don't know about all the menu, they need to put another one to teach her.",

I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for me asking if we can order and requesting for water three times.  After getting seated, we looked through the menu and waited.  About 10 mins go by, so I asked the female server who was cleaning the table if we can order and she asked to give her a second.  Okay, I'm fine with a second.  Well there were two servers cleaning the table.  We didn't even get water served yet and I was hella thirsty.  As I ordered, I asked for water.  The 1st female server brought me my tea and Ramune, but no water .  Asked the 2nd female server for water and she brings me one glass.  Had to ask for a another glass for my son.  The only male server was the only attentive one and noticed how rude the other servers were and apologized multiple times .  In the opposite end, the food was yummy.  Ramen broth was very flavorful.  The gyu don was the perfect taste- not too salty and it even came with a small salad and miso soup which was not indicated on the menu.",

You have a choice between ramen or an udon bowl, then you have a choice between a mini chashu bowl, fried rice or curry bowl and you get a soda. All for $12! You seriously cannot beat that deal. I literally have not tried anything else because I get insanely full or I always have leftovers to take home.   The service has always been friendly and I love the Japanese decor. As long as the lunch special remains, they'll have a forever customer in me.",

I had some noodles and a pork bun, the noodles were average but on my gosh that pork bun was fire!!!!

It reminds me a lot of Japanese summer night festivals. We were seated in a booth tucked away in the corner.  The menu is pretty vast. Lots of options for udon, ramen, and various rice bowls. They also seem to have a decent alcohol selection. I ended up ordering the katsudon which is deep-fried pork cutlet with eggs and a sweet soy sauce over rice. My boyfriend ordered the curry tonkatsu don.   It took a bit of time before the server got to us even though the restaurant was pretty empty and there were several servers on the floor, but he was nice. The food was good, but not particularly memorable. The curry lacks the flare of Curry Zen and the tonkatsu was a bit dry. I loved the presentation though. Our meals came with miso soup, a side salad, and some pickled vegetables.   I'd come back, but I'd probably try something else like ramen.",

I will definitely order it again. We saw they had a spicy tonkatsu ramen and we might try it next time. I wonder if it is the same broth as the short rib. The broth was soooo good.",

When we walked into the restaurant & left, we weren't greeted at all. I thought it was a bit weird, but I figured it was because everyone was occupied.   We had enough time to look through the menu and order what food we wanted, along with our drinks. We were able to get our appetizers in a timely manner, but all of our food items were given as soon as they were sent out. So I would get my appetizer before my hubby's and he would get his meal before mine. I do understand the urgency, but I suppose I'm just used to getting all of our food at once and together.   Regardless, their food never disappoints. I am a big fan of their ramen and can't get over it! I enjoyed my meal overall. I will be coming back to see if there service was different because of the big party today.",

Parking is convenient in the plaza. The menu is pretty expansive with ramen, udon, soba, rice, and other apps that you can nibble on.  The Katsu-Don seemed to be the most popular since it took up half the page in the menu. It is a pork katsu fried with eggs and onions with a sweet sauce throughout the meat and the rice. The katsu was fried well and the meat wasn't dry. The eggs and onions had a good balance of sweet and savory. Overall, a hefty meal for $12. (Also came with a side salad, miso soup, and a couple pickled veges.  I didn't get to try the other dishes but I feel this place benefits from its variety of dishes you can choose from. The flavor is good but it's not extraordinary and a must have. That said, I would still come back for a decent meal even though I'd hope to get better service next time since the servers were a bit slow and even forgot us a couple of times.",

I couldn't decide between a rice bowl or ramen but I was happy to see they offer a small rice bowl sample for a cheaper price so I was able to try the ramen and small rice bowl.   Most interesting thing about this place is their tonkatsu challenge. Two of my cousins tried the challenge and failed!  20 min to eat 3 slabs of tonkatsu drenched in curry sauce and big bowl of rice!  The actual tonkatsu was yummy just the portion was so huge.

    "text": "No longer do you have to drive the treacherous roads of Chinatown to enjoy a bowl of hot ramen or rice bowl. This new Japanese-style noodle and rice bowl place is near Rainbow and the 215.   Omoide definitely has a home-y feel to it. It looks cool from the outside, and the interior looks even better. Japanese decorations adorn the wall and the lighting is a bit dim, but perfect to enjoy dinner with company. It sort of makes me think of a modern day version of a noodle house. Everything is clean and organized, and workers had a smile on their faces. Menus are presented in an unconventional clipboard and paper combination.  The waiter we had was friendly and he didn't seem to mind to educate us on the menu items. He also made sure our glasses were never empty and brought us a glass of ice to put in our drinks.  The music playing went along with the environment of the place, which was very pleasing to experience.   We ordered the chicken karaage don and the beef steak don. The beef steak don was cooked to your choice of temperature, but the taste of it with the ginger sauce (I think) was a bit weird. The chicken karaage was better tasting and was a bigger portion. Miso soup was on point and the salad tasted amazing even though it looked a little plain.   If you do decide to get dessert after eating, try the black sesame ice cream. It has a nutty flavor, yet a subtle sweetness to make it a perfect combination of flavors after eating a filling, well-portioned meal here.   Comment cards were offered to us after the meal because they wanted to see how they were doing since they're a new business in town.",

I made my husband pick it up and he was excited that he could stop by Lee's if he wasn't in the mood for noodles.   They just opened yesterday and when we called the first time there was no answer but they finally answered and we were able to order. My tonkatsu shoyu was more tonkatsu than shoyu but it was creamy and flavorful. I'm a bit thirsty after it but I assume it's just from the saltiness? The noodles were precooked in the to go box which could be a good thing or bad thing. They should probably offer an option of doing either or. Luckily the noodles were cooked al dente so when the noodles and soup were combined it wasn't a bunch of soggy noodles. The bamboo pieces were hard to eat but I definitely like the charsui. The onigri was ok. Nothing to go crazy about but it's a nice filler.   Overall, I'm glad they are opening more places around the southwest so we don't have to make the trek down to Chinatown. I'm definitely coming back when I feel the need to eat ramen. =)",

The tempura was nice and lightly battered as well.  For a main entree I got the spicy Tonkatsu Ramen. Yum! I'm going to say its on par with Monta. The chirashi was thicker then normal though. But still soft.   My husband got Tonkutsu Curry.  It was delicious, although I wish there was a spicy option for it.   Will be back!!",

    "text": "Recently opened, this restaurant is located in Southwest side of Vegas. As the name of the restaurant \"Omoide Noodles & Bowls\" says, their menu mainly consist of noodles (choice of udon/soba in either hot/cold) and bowls with few appetizers.   ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere of this place itself deserves 5 stars. The interior resembles a lot like Omoide Yokocho in Sinjuku or Dotonburi Yokocho in Osaka. Just like the name \"Omoide\" which means memories, I was having a nostalgic moment as soon as I walked in. Aw, I would just come here just to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.  SERVICE Quick, attentive and friendly. Servers here were all smiling and were quick to refill water/constantly asking if we are doing ok.   FOOD I was craving some cold noodles and went with Shio Buta Bukkake. I went with Udon instead of soba. Food arrived within 10 mins. I looked at my bowl and was surprised at how simple it looked. Udon in tsuyu, with green onions and few pieces of shio buta on the side.   The soup, or tsuyu was on the saltier side but overall had a lot of flavor even though it looked so simple. I realized halfway that there were some yuzu kosho (seasoning made of yuzu peel, pepper and salt. Citrusy and refreshing) on the shio buta. If you get the Shio Buta Bukkake, then I advise you to mix the green onions and yuzu kosho together. Makes it more flavorful! As much as I loved this, portion was small and soup was too salty for my taste.   In addition to the bowl of noodle, I also ordered tempura mix. Mmh..for $6, definitely not worth it. Unless you are craving tempura, I would not order this. Few pieces of shrimp, along with vegetable tempura. It was just ok.   CONCLUSION Would like to see more options on the menu. I would like to see tsukemen added to the menu since they mainly serve noodles and rice bowls, but just a suggestion. Will return again!",

The server was alone and had to juggle all the tables so we did have a bit of a wait between her visits but they were frequent enough to not feel lost with the other groups. This is a place If you are new to noodles you should bring someone with you who knows the dishes. We spent alot of time looking up each ingredient as there were no translations on the menu. I ended up with a curry bowl and it was a bit on the heavy side with okay flavor. I also tried their miso soup which I love but it was a bit bland. Their drink menu was pretty much non existent there were only 2 kinds of sake. Overall it was an okay experience. I am a foodie so if someone said hey let's go here I would go again but it would not be a place I would pick oh my own.",

My fiance ordered the spicy tonkotsu and it had the right amount of flavor to it.  I wish the karraage was a little more crispy, but that's a personal preference to me.   I ordered the katsu don,  once again not bad, just wish there was more flavor in the pork and rice so I just asked for hot sauce.  The part I dislike is that there are no descriptions or images, so we had to ask the server to explain things on the menu.  Another suggestion, have Yelp help you (thanks to the previous reviews and photos !!!)  The atmosphere/decor was super cute.    This is the primary reason it got an extra star  (just being honest).   The servers are attentive.  The food was good.  I think they could kick it up a notch with the flavoring, but with everything else I would definitely come back !!",

    "text": "Came across this place driving from Henderson since Monta Chaya was a 45 min wait. Saw this on Rainbow Blvd and decided to stop here and try it.   Off the bat when walking in, the atmosphere was really nice. Had that Japan feel like eating at an alley of Japan which was a nice feeling! Even had a little noodle bar. Only thing is it was a little chilly I guess they didn't have the heater on, but eating Ramen would warm me up in no time!   For appetizer I ordered the Tuna Sashimi ($10) which took a little time to get to me. It tasted fresh and not stringy at all like some tunas would. Was so creamy and had 3 different kind of seaweeds. Was quite interesting especially the clear looking one. It was yummy.   For Ramen I got the Tonkoysu Miso ($7.75) with toppings of Nori ($.75), and Egg ($1.50). As I was waiting for my order, I totally forgot to add the butter, but once I tasted my ramen, it was so yummy and buttery already and didn't need it anymore. It was so tasteful and yet so light. It came with the usual veggies/bamboo shoots and chashu. Although I didn't taste much garlic which I love with ramen.  Hubby and son ordered the Ton Katsu Curry Don. ($10.00) came with a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. The curry and chicken together was such a good flavor and perfect spiciness. By this time nothing can go wrong with the food. Everything was delicious.   Why only 3 stars? Well the food took more time to come out than other usual ramen places. We also had ordered 3 pork buns as appetizer, but never came out and had to cancel the order since it was put on our bill. It was really chilly inside the restaurant even after eating my Ramen and being the fact that I had to eat with my jacket on was super uncomfortable. And lastly, for being an Izakaya, they didn't have much options on their menu as other Izakayas. Other than that, our server was great and super happy with all the food we got. Will definitely be back for more.",

    "text": "I came here on opening day unknowingly and at the time, you could tell they just opened.  I walked in and it seemed really established. The furniture was new and they designed the restaurant well with Japanese themed decorations. The menu is fairly simple, but if you aren't familiar with Japanese dishes, then it could be a challenge. I knew most of the items on the menu, but it seemed to have some duplications so I asked about them. The waitress half answered my question with no confidence until she asked her manager and even with the manager's answer, I didn't buy it. I still don't know the difference between the katsu don and tonkatsu don. Then I just asked about a few more items and she had to continue going back and asking about them. I know she will learn in time, but I thought knowledge of items would be something that would be well covered before opening. As long as she learns, I don't mind.  The food was nothing spectacular, just up to par for Japanese food. Their onigiri was not that great at all. I got the beef and bonito onigiri and I wouldn't order them here again honestly unless a lot of time has passed. I ordered the chicken karaage bowl and it comes with a salad and soup. They forgot my soup and when I told them I was missing my soup, it didn't come out very hot, so that was a red flag for me. My mom ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and it wasn't spicy at all. The noodles and everything else in it was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I see major potential for this place and can help fulfill the missing Japanese food niche in Vegas. They had a lot of hiccups opening day, but things can turn around really easily.",

    "text": "Worst Service hands down. The food is decent but after today we will never be back again. There has never been a time that we came here and felt like we received decent service yet we always attempt to give them another chance. After waiting 8 minutes for a server to even approach us we had to ask him to take our drink order since clearly he didn't think we needed drinks with our food.   The food came out in the most random times. We are a family of 5 with 3 children. Our food came out first and we had to wait about another 12 minutes for our kids to get their food. By then our food was cold but we didn't want to ruin our dinner by complaining. No one bothered checking on us and we didn't get 1 refill till the end of our meals.   The place wasn't packed so I couldn't figure out why they couldn't check in on their guest. I would have walked away without taking the time to write this review but what  happened when I went to pay for my bill is what truly lead me to leave this post. We have eaten here many times before and typically order the same dishes. When I got the bill I handed him my card and when I went to write in the gratuity I noticed that there was already a 18% gratuity that was automatically added. When I asked the server if they charge auto gratuity he said yes for a party of 5. I then looked at the menu, looked at the signage around the store and found nothing that informs customers that an auto gratuity would be applied to their bills. Considering the fact that this wasn't our first time here this came unexpected. I understand that those who work in the top industry work hard to make tips. I understand the policy of auto gratuity what I don't understand is why there was no signage and why we were not informed of this policy. Not only did we receive horrible service which was practically no service at all I am forced to pay auto gratuity without knowledge and without the servers actually putting in work for it.   This is extremely unprofessional and management should inform their customers on this new policy and post this information on their menus like everyone else does when auto gratuity is required. This place needs new management, new employees, and should learn how to provide service since that is in fact the sole purpose of their restaurant business.",

I'm a wannabe connoisseur of tonkatsu ramen. I've been trying to sample it from every ramen house in the valley. Omoide has landed very high on my list. At $8, it's one of the best values of ramen available. The broth was thick and creamy, salt content was good. The noodles had that slight dense chew, which I like. Chashu was melt-in-your-mouth as it should be. Tamago (egg) was perfectly seasoned with a perfect custard-like yolk, nice portions of bamboo shoots, mushroom, and green onion. No bean sprouts which I'm totally okay with. I would rank them in my top 3 for sure.   Their menu is a great value all around. Their mini chashu bowl was $4 and came with a generous serving of chashu, perfect for a kids meal. The regular size poke bowl was pretty big, I don't know who would need a large. Low prices, high quality, big portions, absolutely exceptional.",

You have a choice of either Udon or Ramen and then a choice of chashu bowl, mini curry or mini fried rice, plus a soda for $12! What a deal!   Downside, when we ordered this special for my kids (aged 8 and 6) they don't have any juice options or they wouldn't substitute a calpico drink for the soda, as we don't give or allow our kids to have soda.   My husband ordered their special which was a spicy short rib ramen ($12). When it arrived there were 2 bones with both fairly a decent amount of beef on the bone. The beef was soft and tender. The broth had just enough spice, but enough to make my husband's nose start running.   With the amount of people we had in our party, the food and service was pretty on point.   I would definitely come back here again!",

My friends ordered a bowl of Ramen, Chicken Karaage and the Onigiri.   My favorite was the Chasu bowl! So tender, so flavorful, so delicious! I like everything we ordered, the miso cod fish was also pretty good, and so were the rest of the food we ordered. When we received the bill, I was pretty surprised as it was very reasonable!   Good food, good service, good price! Will definitely be back and recommend to friends and family.",

We had very friendly waiter who provided us with great service.  I ordered vegetarian miso ramen and I like it a lot. The portions are pretty big as well. Tuna tataki was also pretty good as well as cod. My husband didn't like the meet tataki but since I didn't try it I can not say much. He did like the buns though.  Overall very good experience. I would recommend this place.",

First thing, the outside of the restaurant catches your eye and so does the interior, it's unique and up my alley, love the overall vibes!  When I got the menu, I was so surprised by how many choices they had. But what I get is always limited, katsudon, curry katsu, or ramen. Because I was craving katsudon more, I got that and we also ordered the curry katsu and spicy tonkotsu ramen. Also an order of karaage chicken. Prices I believe  are all about $10 and up, but the portions are pretty big.  Loved the presentation of the foods. So first the karaage chicken isn't that crispy on the outside, but it's still pretty good and it's seasoned well. The curry and tonkatsu was really good too. The curry here is a bit more flavorful and a bit sweeter than zen curry, so I prefer the curry here compared to there. The katsudon is also good, but wouldn't order it next time. It didn't have a lot of sauce which would've moistened and seasoned the rice a bit and not a lot of onions or egg as I thought. The spicy tonkotsu ramen was bomb! Not that spicy as I thought, noodles on point, just loved it. It tasted a little korean in my opinion, but anyways really good. Totally would order that again.  Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants I've tried that isn't an AYCE. Coming back next time!",

I'm a fan for authentic Japanese food and raised by a Japanese mom, have traveled to Japan and just know what the food should taste like..  the food here is just not that good to me. Could be ingredients or just quality but even the soba I ordered today had an off taste that soba shouldn't have. I ate most of it because I was hungry and didn't want to wait. My daughter had udon, which is the most simplest Japanese food to make. But even that wasn't that good. The only thing I liked was the cold tofu and the salmon kushiage.   Service was great but I do hope they get better because they could have potential with their menu choices.",

I love the atmosphere, it's really unique. I've never seen anything like it so far in Vegas.  Just know if you decide to come eat here, you'll end up taking pictures of their decorations.  I should mention, it did take a while for service to reach our table.  Even though the store wasn't busy when we visited the store, It still took a while for a server to come to our table.  This left me feeling uneasy about the quality of food we'd receive from them.    I've ordered the King Tonkatsu, the server said the challenge will consist of 3 orders of this and also 2 rice bowls.  In order to see what challenges lie in front of me, I decided to sample something similar to the challenge.  The dish is served with a giant slab of tonkatsu and a little bowl of rice.  Alongside some veggies and sauce for the tonkatsu.  I was able to finish the plate, but the flavor wasn't there.  I feel as though they've focused more on making a quantity, but lost the flavor along the way.    Overall, I don't think I can take on the challenge.  It's hard to consume food that won't help me consume it.  Maybe another time I'll revisit the store for their Ramen instead.",

Lunch special consists of a bowl of ramen, salad, and a rice bowl. All that and a drink for a pretty good price! I haven't been for dinner, but I can imagine it can get busy pretty quickly. The restaurant is not that big and parking lot is also small.  The interior design also makes this place so fun. You feel as if you are in an alley in Japan eating street food because of how the decorations are. I think it sets the mood and makes it feel even more authentic, lol.  There are other options besides noodle bowls that I haven't tried, but given what I have eaten, everything has been delicious and well cooked. It is a little warm in the restaurant, so that combined with warm soup does make it a little uncomfortable later. I was sweating at the end while eating soup, but it was delicious. And they have Onigiri here, which I have always been wanting to try.",

Not too many ramen places have honey toasts or poke bowl options on their menu!

I hadn't been in a while and was pleasantly surprised to see Japanese style pasta offerings, LA style poke (didn't know there was such a thing), and honey toast!  Oh honey!! :)  Highlights:  The mentaiko pasta was soooo delicious!  You can choose between ramen or udon noodles.  I got it with ramen noodles that were cooked to al dente perfection!  It had a slightly salty, spicy, and light, creamy flavor.  I think I could have eaten a second order, it was that good!  If the cod roe scares you, do not fear.  The roe is blended into the sauce so you don't even see it.    Grilled shishito peppers - Perfect appetizer!  Sprinkle some lemon juice and you can eat these peppers like they were a bag of chips!  Awesome lunch special!  Choice of ramen or udon with a side of a rice dish (grilled pork belly on rice, curry, or fried rice), and a soft drink for $12!!  The portions are all regular sized portions too!!  A Little Lowlight:  The kimchi pork bao was underwhelming.  Maybe it was because I could see the chefs using a microwave, and the pork had some lukewarm/cold spots here and there...  This little hiccup won't stop me from coming back here though. I think next time, I would order the grilled pork belly bao and give them baos another try.  The staff here has always been great!  Maybe one day I will take on the King Tonkatsu challenge!!",

    "text": "Not a bad choice for a quick Asian meal.  This is a popular place, and it's not that big inside. So, you might have wait at peak times.   The interior has a cool rustic Asian decor, and the staff were very friendly.   They have a modest sized menu with some popular mainstream Asian dishes.   We tried the potato croquettes and chicken karage to start. Both were very good. The croquettes were perfect with a crunchy exterior and a soft, warm interior of delicious potato filling. The karage was similarly good. It was high quality meat (breast I think) unlike the cheap mystery meat you get at lesser establishments. It was lightly fried and crispy without tasting too greasy. Very good!  I went for the katsu which is a classic favorite. It was not quite Saboten, but it was quite good. Tender though not exactly \"cut it with a fork\" meat with a crunchy coating that was not overly greasy or oily. It was served with a small salad and miso soup which were both fine though nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "This is a nice little local spot. Casual atmosphere, music at a good level, and attentive service. We started with Pumpkin Croquettes and Tako Yaki appetizers. Tako Yaki is a ball of fried octopus, and it was perfectly cooked and drizzled with a tasty sauce. The pumpkin croquettes were different, but no complaints at the table. It was sweet and savory, and fried so how could you go wrong?  The Udon Shrimp Tempura was served boiling hot, with two large pieces of tempura shrimp. Could have used a larger portion of Udon noodles, but the flavor was on point. A friend had the Katsu Don, a large portion of breaded chicken over rice, served with salad, pickled veggies and miso soup. The plate was empty so I assume he enjoyed it! Finally we tried the Honey Toast, (I try honey toast every time I see it on a menu.) It was good. That's all I can say. Not spectacular, not bad at all. The side of black sesame ice cream tasted like it had spent too long in the freezer, probably not popular enough to sell through regularly.  I'd try it again if I was going to eat with a friend or group, and was looking for a quick, hot lunch.",

The broth is not greasy and not super salty, just the right amount of everything. The egg was perfectly cooked and I just enjoyed every second of it. I will definitely be coming back again.

We stopped in about 8pm on Saturday night - the place was busy, but we were seated immediately. That's where the goodness ends.   We looked at the menus for a while - long enough for the people who came in behind us to be seated, get drinks and food. No one had come by to get our drink orders or even check us. Of course, I understand being busy, but at the very least any type of issue should have been communicated to us.   After discussing how rude and unprofessional this is, we  decided to leave. If you can't be bothered with taking care of your customers and making them all feel welcome, we can't be bothered with dining at your establishment or recommending it to anyone.   Went down the street to Bonsai and had a wonderful experience and meal.",

She suggested some great appetizers along with an entree that hit spot. We tried the karaage and shishito peppers as an app, then I had the spicy ramen. All delicious!!  The ramen was pretty spicy but I LOVE spicy!! So it was perfect.  I'll be back especially when winter arrives!!!",

Reason for the three stars: For the Katsu Don, they scramble the egg where as I would have preferred sunny side up. The Katsu had a soggy chicken nugget crust instead of a tradition crunchy one. Lastly, the meat to rice ratio was slightly off and I found myself with lots of leftover rice. Overall the location has really adorable decorations gives it a authentic look. Friendly staff. OMG you can not leave without trying the honey toast ! It's probably the best I've ever had EVER !",

WHY NOT?  I mean, chicken katsu is not some off-the-wall request.  Most restaurants that serve katsu give you the option.  I might've still tried the place out if she'd been more willing to suggest other options or even if she just lied and pretended to ask the kitchen if they'd make an accommodation, but she didn't.  She just said \"no.\"  Okay, thanks for your lack of effort. I guess I won't make the effort either.",

It was a spice level of about 1 of 10. Shrimp tempura was fried perfectly as sometimes people tend to cook it too long and the 3 shrimp were placed in a big bowl of rice and curry. One thing I wished this place had was some alcoholic beverages. Decor was cool. You can see all the paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling as well.",

We were seated all the way in the corner, we had to wait a really long time just to order and then another really really long time for my food. I wanted to order shrimp tempura for my noodles but it came so freaking late my noodles were already finished. Oh btw the broth isnt that good I got the kake udon and there weren't enough noodles and my friend ordered udon as well but he orders extra noodles with it. Let me tell you this, my friend finished his whole bowl of noodles and the soup even got cold before they brought out his extra noodles. I don't understand why they didn't just put it in the bowl and serve it all at once? Well anyways basically service was really bad and really slow and they kept forgetting our order, plus the food was mediocre. I tried to order Mochi and they were literally out of every flavor except like 3 flavors. I feel like The owner spent too much money on how the place will look but not enough time on the product. Sorry but I probably won't be coming back ): oh! And to add the soups are really expensive for such a small portion it's not even worth it. It's like $9-$10 a bowl when you can get cheaper and more in your bowl elsewhere",

I typically try the noodle dishes -- which are really good every time I've ordered -- but the sushi, onigiri, and everything else i've had has been excellent. This is a super casual place with a friendly staff and a decent ambiance that you should check out next time you're in the mood for Japanese food.",

They were like sad curly spaghetti noodles. As a Asian, I was highly disappointed. The nori tasted really bad like that freeze dried out of package taste but the tamago egg was good! Their gyoza was cooked perfectly with an amazing sauce added. Our green tea was disgusting and was watered down sooooo badly.  Prices are fairly normal but their add on prices are a little spiked up.  They filled our waters in a timely manner and our server was really nice. The interior of the restaurant was simply beautiful. Very high ceilings and cute seating arrangements. I will be back to try the shrimp tempura udon!",

When I come here, I rarely order ramen. I recommend other items on the menu. Now they serve poke-bowl, LA style. A lot of things have improved. The servers are friendly and polite.

The edamame seems standard and very similar to the one at Bachi Burger (this isn't a complaint, as I very much enjoyed it). I'm not gonna lie, I never eat the chashu, so I don't even feel qualified to give an opinion. Sometimes when you order miso ramen, it comes out with a very thick broth, which I am not a fan of. This did not happen at Omoide, however. It was a good balance of spice and miso.  The decor here is very, very cute. The servers are nice and attentive. I hope Omoide does well because I'm interested in trying the other offerings!",

    "text": "The best katsu in southwest Las Vegas between 10 - 11pm!!!  We stopped in to Omioide and went with the waitress's recommendations, Tonkatsu Ramen, Katsu Don, Konbu Onigiri, and Pumkin Croquette. Aside from the raw egg white on the Katsu Don everything was palatable...then again most places aren't going merely for palatable food options. We didn't hate any items we tried...but we would certainly rather venture elsewhere. The ramen lacked flavor, and I literally thought on first bite, \"Well, this is edible.\" My favorite item was the Pumkin Croquette, but even here; this isn't something I could ever envision myself specifically wanting to stop in to Omioide to get. All around they are a strong two star or very weak three stars. The problem is that with the exception of ramen most of their menu can be found nearby at a similar price point with much better versions. ...and for ramen I'd rather make the trip to Flamingo or Spring Mountain than come back. It sounds a little harsh, but the food certainly wasn't A-OK...it was precisely, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  It's hard to recommend an item that was served with unintended raw egg, but if you find your way here, I think I would go with the Katsu Don to go with the aforementioned Pumkin Croquette. Omioide took over the old Rice Trax building and fans of that quality & originality of food may enjoy themselves here.   The interior is more than adequate for this price range and we actually really like the padded double-chair/loveseat-chairs. They were comfortable and certainly something you don't typically find. While we didn't particularly relish anything, Omioide seems like the kind of place that will do okay in this part of town with teenagers, twenty-something's, and individuals that don't seek out great food.",

Another thing I didn't care for is when they brought the bill, they circled the suggested tip area to remind me to tip. That's really tacky.",

We literally waited for 25 minutes for our ramen to come out and it wasn't even that good. I'd rather wait 45 minutes at Monta to get seated and eat some good ramen.   The kitchen was so backed up. They brought one of the appetizers we ordered and it was wrong so I sent it back. They gave us a complimentary vegetable tempura for the messed up. I kept on hearing the servers apologizing for their kitchen being backed up but yet the servers couldn't keep up cleaning the tables, waiting on the tables, and serving the customers which I didn't understand when there's 5 of them and since there's no food coming out of the kitchen. Our ramen finally came out 25 minutes later but we still never got the wrong appetizer that I had sent back and the other appetizer we have ordered. I might give them a chance months down the road if their service improves.",

I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was the perfect amount of spice. The cheese corn and the squid are amazing too, great appetizers. The workers are super polite which made our visit much more enjoyable. 10/10 would reccomend and go again. (:",

At first I thought the name meant 'Heavy' since Omoi means Heavy in Japanese, but when I saw the word Omoide in kanji I realized it means likes to Reminisce or to remember memories.  They have a variety of food to choose from: Udon, Ramen, Gyuudon (Meat Bowl), etc.  My friends and I chose this place to try their ramen. The last time I went, I saw that they also have Poke Bowls which was new to me since the last time I went to Omoide.  I had the Tonkatsu Miso while my other friends had the regular Tonkatsu. The ramen had the usual meat, bamboo, and seaweed.  It also consist of thin type of noodles.  Overall, it was delicious~  It tasted similar to other Ramen restaurants I've been too.  It was a nice experience, would go again to try out their other foods~",

We did have a few questions about some foods because the menu didn't really explain what some of the dishes contained.   One of our friends asked if he could try their curry sauce and the waitress looked confused about why he wanted to taste it. He had to explain that he wanted to taste it so he could decide whether he would choose a dish that contained the curry and she just nodded left and came back a few minutes later with the curry. The curry was watery and not as thick as other restaurants make it.  My husband and I got the takoyaki, salmon avocado salad, and Ebi fry don. The Ebi fry was okay. It was kind of chewy and may have been fried a little too much. The salmon was good and the takoyaki was okay.   As we ended our meal the waitress took her time to come to us and hand us our bills. This was a change from her rushing us and I personally didn't like how much of a difference her attitude changed from the beginning of our meal to the end.",

The 2 dishes I tried were both good. There aren't very many non-sushi Japanese restaurants in Vegas, but this one makes up for it. Authentic items on the menu, but they didn't taste authentic. But that doesn't mean they didn't taste good.  Chashu bowl: Fatty pork, but that melt in your mouth kind of fat. Not the chewy stuck in your mouth kind of fat. Heavily flavored and dripping sauce into the rice. A plus.  Ebi-don. Oyako-don, but with tempura shrimp instead of chicken. They don't usually serve it with tempura shrimp in Japan, but I can see the appeal.Very filling. Both dishes came with a salad, soup and pickled veggies.  They have a lunch special where you can order a noodle and rice dish with a soda. Super cheap and an easy carry out too!",

Ordered ramen but was not impressed with it (if you scroll down through the comments you'll see similar reviews from when they first opened).   Was very craving ramen tonight and this was the only place open after 11 pm in the area. I Gave it another shot. Wow, what an improvement! I don't know if they changed chef or something, it was really good.   Ramen was al dente, egg was perfect, compliments all flavorful. The soup is definitely lighter than Monta's and less salty. Which I don't think is a bad thing at all. Just different styles.   Think this will be my new midnight spot after work. I'll try a few more things and update my review.  I know that they got hit hard with some low star reviews from the beginning. Giving five stars to help bring their average up.",

It's next to all these amazing food spots so I decided to give it a try with some friends who were craving noodles and soup.   I ordered the vegetarian soba noodles with the egg. We asked for the spice rack and they only have us 4 options and none of them were spicy. It's more savory and mild and it's nothing compared to Monta or any other ramen places.   The ambiance is overall nice and they play some great tunes. I also noticed they do poke bowls which is interesting for an overall advertised noodle place.",

    "text": "On Las Vegas rare snowy day called for a warm bowl of Ramen. This is our 2nd time to Omoide Noodles & Bowls. We typically go to a different Ramen joint but we liked that this location had tuna sashimi. Tonight we saw they had Tuna Tataki. According to the menu it looked like seared tuna, so we decided to switch it up and try the Tuna Tataki because the picture on the menu made it look delicious. Upon receiving the Tuna Tataki it looked nothing like the picture. I have attached a collage of what we received, what the menu showed it was, and what the menu showed Beef Tataki was. The item we received looked more like Beef Tataki and nothing like Tuna Tataki from the menu. Needless to say we should have stuck to normal Tuna Sashimi & won't even get Tuna Tataki again. I asked our waiter if they gave us beef Tataki on accident since it looked more like that and nothing like Tuna Tataki on the menu. He apologized and told me that they typically tell customers that they put the sauce on the ahi and not on the side. I also asked if it was suppose to have black pepper crust and he said typically it does. He agreed that basically it was False advertisement because the Tuna Tataki looked nothing like what it was advertised as. Customer service was good but Very disappointed with the quality of the food & False advertisement.",

Their ramen is the best in my opinion in comparison to Jinya, Monta, Sora, and other places I've tried. The karaage chicken is the bomb - perfectly seasoned and fried to the right texture and crunchiness. The tempura is battered light and airy; yet it has that perfect crunchiness and real simple taste (clean and non-oily or greasy frying). I once ordered their misoyaki butterfish (black cod), but I wasn't too impressed. I used to eat at a Japanese restaurant in Hawaii that employed highly trained Japanese chefs from Japan so I think I got spoiled from that. Because of those great Japanese chefs, I know good Japanese food when I taste it.",

We appreciated the warmth, especially the extra warm restrooms, that gave flashbacks to the warm heated toilet seats in Japan. These toilet seats weren't heated but the adorable little bathroom space was extra warm and cozy.  This ramen shop was conveniently located off the freeway on the drive back to Southern California. Our group arrived and departed in staggered times which probably made it easier for the restaurant to manage.   There were vegetarian options for those that didn't eat meat and they were still hearty, warm and satisfying ramen. The majority of the party ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and added an egg. Some people didn't get eggs as the kitchen ran out but we weren't charged for them.   A big thumbs up for the service that tried their best to accommodate our group.",

It's simple, but don't expect the best tasting broth or quality. It's not bad tasting, but it's not the greatest. Their pricing is around the same as other places near by, so you'll look to spend around $8-$13 per entree. I only tried their katsu and ramen here. I actually thought the katsu was pretty good!

I've had way better udon noodles. My friends ordered their ramen and they were like where is the egg? It was pretty plain and they charge you extra for everything while at the other ramen places it's included. The positive thing is this place is open late that's what attracted us to go to it.",

    "text": "This place is okay. I pass by this place on my way to work so I thought 'Oh cool, a place that my boyfriend and I can try!'  Honestly, their stuff is a little overpriced... $2 for one rice ball? That's kind of ridiculous. The soup I expected to be about $9-$10, but the flavor wasn't all that great. We ordered takoyaki which is so much better at Ramen Tatsu. Something about the flavor was kind of off. I got the spicy tonkotsu miso and my boyfriend got the spicy tonkotsu. His soup was grainy... My noodles were really mushy. We don't like to complain when we're hungry, so I'm just warning you all out there that honestly, there's better choices out there. I'm glad I tried it because I can say that I'll be heading back over to Monta or Ramen Sora instead. It's a shame because I really wanted to like you guys. I do like that you guys offer a variety of food options, but the prices are definitely a turn off. *sad face*",

It is pretty skinny for udon and also the meat portion on it is a joke. I ordered the curry broth which was very good actually, but it came with pork belly that was 3 small pieces. It was literally small as a strip of super thin bacon sliced into 3 pieces.   The decor was on point and service. Just need to work on giving a little bit more meat in the portions.",

The appetizers were ok, the only huge complaint I have was the broth in the actual soup. It was so bland and flavorless. It definitely needs to be spruced up: I ordered the shrimp tempera soup and the shrimp was placed on top of the soup so by the time you eat the shrimp they are completely soggy and ruined. The music and ambiance was cool but the lights needed to be slightly dimmed. If they would work on the flavor of the soup we might consider coming back.",
