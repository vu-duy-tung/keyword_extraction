This place has limited items, compared to other Korean BBQ joints back in L.A. The price also appeared to be unreasonable for the amount and quality we were getting as well. For about $60.00 you can get a lot more variety elsewhere. I guess if you are craving Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, then this place would be your first choice, since it's also on the strip.",

    "text": "BIG BIG BIG TRAP!!! We called to reserve or enquire about table availability because we thought it would be packed since it was all you can eat. But my wife heard a lady speaking half english that did not even answer our question, then hung up. We were hungry so went anyway because we love KBBQ.  Went for the \"All you can eat\" for $30/person. It looked more like a \"1 hour -  you only get 1 cut of meat once - then get the fuck out!\" type of deal.  Where is the \"all you can eat\" when you can't order more of some meat? The time limit of 1H to eat is also bullshit because they are open 24H a day, so what's the rush to kick us out when 80% of the restaurant is empty? It was more like a packaged \"4 cuts of meats once\" disguised and renamed \"all you can eat\". After looking at the pics that everyone posted....it looks like the server served us the least tastiest meat options they offer, like we got the left over. At the end we actually had a fith unappetizing and unwanted option of chicken which we refused, but she just threw it on the grill anyway. At this point we were ready to leave. We left the place wanting to order more of what WE wanted to consume (but couldn't) and very dissapointed, partly because of the server's bipolar attidude. One time she will be nice, then the next time she comes around she will be irritated and vice versa during the whole dinning experience.(The middle aged very skinny korean lady if you want to know)  TO THE OWNER: (which I know will never read this because these type of people don't care about ratings) DON'T LIE ABOUT THE \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" BECAUSE IT WASN'T WHAT WE GOT!!! YOUR BIG SIGN OUTSIDE IS A  LYING TRAP",

    "text": "I was very hesitant after reading other Yelp reviews. However, I have a different viewpoint since I know what to expect from a Korean service standpoint.   In Korea, servers are not there to socialize or be kind. They take your order and serve you food. In Korea, they actually do not come to your table without you ringing for them first. Knowing this, I wasn't expecting an American server experience with smiles and greetings. The experience was authentic. The place was packed with other Koreans.   We received our food fast and efficiently. They came over periodically to check to see how we are doing and if we needed anything additional. The food was excellent and the banchan was plentiful.   A tip was not automatically added in to our bill. We both had the all you can eat.   If you want more flavor ask for gochujang. It's a flavorful sauce that will add a kick.   Know that you will get plenty of food and walk out feeling quite stuffed. Do not expect happy fuzzy care from your server. However they do busy their butts so tip!!! You will not have just 1 server. Whoever is closest will ask if you need anything. Based on my observations everyone that works here is Korean. So cut them some slack, they aren't familiar with American culture in being a waitress.   It could've been cheaper, but other than that we enjoyed the food.",

The woman said she could not get anything other than all you can eat because the rest of the table was getting it. We told her there is no point in her paying $30 to eat vegetables and rice. She insisted she had to order all you can eat as well so we just did it since we were already seated and starving at this point. She never asked us for drink orders and in the end price there was a 20 dollar tip included on the bill which she claims it states is included on the menu which I did not see. This place smelled disgusting walking in. Waitress was rude probably due to the fact that tip is included. Also she told my vegetarian friend  that if she didn't want to pay $30 for AYCE then she has to sit at a different table alone if she wants to order vegetable tempura. Do not go there !!",

After choosing your meats (we went with beef and chicken), they fire up the grill on your table and you cook at your own pace. They slice the meat thin enough so you're not waiting very long for it to cook, which I think is a huge plus. They also offer mini sides (at no additional cost) of kimchi, pickled dikon and bean sprouts to freshen your palette.  All you can eat for ~$35? You can't really go wrong!",

Here was how it went down; I was seated and was comfortably welcome however the employees  did not get back to me after 10minutes. I then realize that, \"mayyyybeee\" because there are 2 other family that is already eating, the employees must have had just serviced the 2 family. Yet, 10 minutes went by and it was horibble! I had to get up and tell them I was ready to order. After ordering another 10minutes went by, I had to question them why they were taking so long. The reply was \"we were buzy, sorry.\" My thoughts then were \"how are you guys busy, when there is not even 10 customers?\" I then was finally served after 20minutes but the server/waitress seems to give me a bad look as if I was intruding when I asks for the order meat to cook. Not only that but I was there for an all you can eat....the employees there is just bad...watch out for the lady in in her 50-60s in the front desk she will force you to tip. All I got to say is that you got hired to do a specific job and you are paid fairly from doing that job. You shouldn't depend on tips. If you do, get a new job.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this place at 2am, after an event at Mandalay Bay. My friends and I are Vegas locals and were excited to try an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant open 24 hours. We decided to put the negative reviews aside, but quickly regretted it.  When we walked in, an older gentleman - I would assume was one of the owners, stood up to seat us. He did not smile nor greet us and did not seem to speak English. While walking to our table, we noticed there was only 1 other party besides us and there were 4 tables that still needed to be cleared.  It was about $30 per person. It is definitely more than the usual AYCE Korean BBQ you find in Chinatown, but for a 24 hour spot, we thought it would balance out. An older, unhappy looking woman came to take our \"order\". Before we could even order, she told us the first two that would come out is the beef brisket and pork belly. After eating the brisket and pork belly, she brought out the tender beef, chicken and short rib (although we didn't order it) and walked away. Later she brought out the spicy pork. I thought it was quite odd, as typical AYCE Korean BBQ spots will ask you what meat(s) you would \"all you can eat\".  We were a party of 3, but when we received the bill, gratuity was already included which brought it to about $37 per person. It was already late and we were already unhappy with the experience, so we paid and left.",

When we asked for more water later, we were laughed at by the server and said \"Wow you are thirsty today!\"  I don't think 3 glasses of water during a n almost 2 hour meal (when some of the food is spicy!) is outrageous or too much to ask, especially when the glasses are filled mostly with ice.  She also made fun of us when a few of our pieces of brisket got burnt (\"don't you know how to cook meats?\").  We were not an isolated case - the table behind us got so offended at a comment that she made that one of the patrons got up and left.  We never got the extra sauce that we asked for, or the refill on one of the meats. We then were left waiting for our check for over 30 minutes and were saddened to see there was an automatic gratuity placed on the bill that we did not feel was justified.

Wife ordered the tofu soup and we didn't expect anything like <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBCD.in&s=a727b2ca7ba17ad2dfded1d105d526820006bf474af32de1b9a6e82d77d5e70b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BCD.in</a> LA but  even BCD instant tofu soup was better then this. Bare ingredients. Few pieces of frozen seafood, tofu and scallion  (halfazz tofu soup) We ate only half.  If you're gonna serve me overpriced food then at least give me something  decent please.  There is a clear difference  between trying to provide good quality food and falling short vs cutting corners using cheapest ingredients Possible for your profit margin  I know rent must be ridiculous on the strip but if they up their quality they would do very well. Maybe the tourists have no idea of what good Korean food is so they don't have to change anything and it doesn't hurt them but I do t be good g back and it sucks cause I love kbbq and it's  location is convenient  Didn't eat the bbq and I wouldnt expect a different quality then what  experienced. Side dishes were wack too.   We took the leftovers and gave it to a homeless man. ( I hate wasting food)",

The place was nearly empty (mind you, it was only 11:30am).   The prices are higher than your usual K-town prices, but Korean is somewhat limited on the strip. We ordered the Doenjang Jjigae, Kimchi Jjigae and the Yook Kimchi Tofu. Everything was surprisingly very tasty. Kimchi Jjigae is my favorite Korean stew, it's what I order 80% of the time, and this one mets my expectations.    Service was great. - I'll definitely be back if I'm craving Korean while in Vegas.",

    "text": "So the deal is $29pp for a handful of meat cuts. The important ones for Korean bbq regulars pretty much there - pork belly and mainly the Galbi. Note that the galbi is only short ribs (LA style) for those that frequent Sydney and Seoul joints. The traditional Galbi is on the a la carte menu and kinda expensive IMO ($40+ a portion - I assume 2 pieces).   Anyway, not a problem but they limit to 2 pieces per person. We lucked out and they actually gave us an extra piece between 2 I think as the pieces they gave us in the first call was a bit stringy or that we skipped out on the chicken items. Who knows.   But the annoying thing is that I started to order our cuts and the lady was like \"I bring out 1, 2, 3 then 4, 5, and 6 for you ok?\" It's like umm no I don't want that and I know what all of them are. And I really don't care for the chicken pieces (had to stop them from bringing it out). They also just went for it without much consultation, threw everything on the grill. Which is very strange as they reminded us to eat everything when we ordered more. But you brought it over and went about it on your own? Not a problem for us as we are big eaters.   When we paid a nearly 15% tip - like a few cents short, could tell that they were unhappy but we were already on the way out. And because it was on the margin of being too little and just enough for their high expectations they didn't kick up a huge stink. After reading some reviews of theirs and others practices, I'm glad they didn't automatically added an 18% tip to our bills. It was the smallest amount as suggested tip though.",

The place is not crowded at all, the tables are seperated thoroughly evenly. The ambience is not too loud but not quiet so it is a good mixture.   The food was good, they have briskets, bulgogi, kalbi,  pork, and chicken. The side dishes were good as well, although, they didn't have fish cakes.   The service started out good. She was proactive about helping us out and getting our food settled but towards the end it's like we didn't exist at all. That's why this place will get 3 star, lack of consistency in service.

The place is semi-hidden by neighboring businesses but you can find it. The food was delicious, friendly service with their staff cooking for us most of the time. There were plenty to eat for the four of us and everything was very tasty. I'm surprised that this place wasn't packed. I'd recommend giving it a try if you want to take a break from the mega hotels & resorts in town.",

    "text": "The Ginseng BBQ is located about 150 ft down a small street between the Walgreen's and Fatburger.  This is directly across the Strip from the Monte Carlo.  This short stroll under several palm trees likely reduces their business level a lot - but it's readily accessible.  There's also some parking right beside the place, no signs of fees for this but might be $5 during the day.  They serve a full menu of Korean dishes including dinners, hot pots and barbeque.  But their prices run quite high for these individual items - for example, the Galbi included with All-You-Can-Eat is $35.95 and Bulgogi is $27.95 - while the AYCE is $29 and includes unlimited of 5 of these pricey items along with full side dishes and a serving of the Galbi.  What a deal!  The price has increased recently to $29 but this is still quite reasonable, for the quality of the food, the quantity and the location.  Sheesh, across the street they're seving fish and chips for $23!  And Ginseng is serving gourmet-quality food.  I visited about 10pm on a Thursday and I became the only customer not long after arriving.  I was greeted and seated warmly and looked at the regular menu before requesting the buffet.  I chose only 4 of the five meat entrees knowing I'd be lucky to finish that.  As it was, I ate very little of the sides and most of the main courses - but my appetite is limited these days.  I chose to skip the Chadolbaegi (brisket) due to reviews here and the Dakgui because it's chicken.  Meat dishes include your choice of up to 6 different items - 4 beef, 1 pork and 1 chicken: 1.  La Galbi - Beef short rib w. our house special sauce 2.  Bulgogi - Thin slices of rib eye marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce 3.  Chadolbaegi - Thin slices of beef brisket point without marinade 4.  Dakgui - Chicken meat marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce 5.  Sam Gyeop Sai - Thin slices of bershire pork skinless belly without marinde (thick-sliced bacon) 6.  Mae Un Dwae Jigui - Grilled spicy pork  Side dishes (8) included white rice, large romaine salad w/tangy dressing, Kimchi, soybean sprouts, pickled radishes and broccoli, grilled cucumber chunks and another green pickled dish.  All were worth a taste but I enjoyed the salad a lot, the sprouts and pickled items the best.  (The menu doesn't list these items or mention they're included.)  There's also a soy-based dipping sauce and a possibly ginger-based chunky dipping sauce.    The waitress understood that I wished assistance in cooking and provided that, after firing up the grill in the center of the table and bringing out my sides and water.  She started the Sam Gyeop Sai - basically thick bacon - laying out the full strips then using scissors to cut the strips into pieces.  After that gained a decent char on both sides, she started the Galbi and Bulgogi, leaving the Mae Un Dwae Jigui until last.  So I had bacon, thin-sliced steak, short ribs, then spicy pork.  My favorite was the Bulgogi, which has a fantastic marinade, followed by the Dwae Jigui, which also has a nice sauce.  The short ribs are more like something you'd find at a chinese buffet and the bacon was just bacon!  All good however.  I think I could manage the cooking myself next time - the bacon and pork favor a nice char and the others just need to be turned frequently to fully-cook.  And there will be another time.  Ginseng has just become MY place on the LV Strip - I'll never visit without eating there at least once.  I mean really, a sirloin steak for $50 or this for under $30 - there's no contest.  Plus, I can't get this down the street in San Antonio - but I'll be looking now!",

I came here for the all you can eat Lunch Buffet but it was hardly that because the waitresses did not keep the food flowing. For a new set of kimchi, it took 40 minutes and 4 different waitresses only to give us a single small plate of cabbage kimchi. A lot of the poor service was simply because we were not Korean/full Korean. The tables with Korean guests speaking Korean got all the meat and Kimchi they could ever want with prompt service. Only wonder the best reviews on Yelp are from Koreans. The meat was okay but the typical favorites such as Galbi were not included in the buffet option and available as an overpriced menu item. Go here if you're desperate for Korean food but don't worry about how much it costs, the service you'll receive, and the quality of food you'll receive.",

When there were not many Korean restaurants in Vegas, I used to take my friends or visitors to this place because they were staying one of the hotels on the strip and it was very convenient for them to come to have a warm meal after a show or shopping.  After having too much of buffet food, they always wanted to have some Korean food on the last day of their departure. But, it is still pricey and they don't do AYCE Korean BBQ. My cousin was in town with her friends and she wanted to have a dinner at Ginseng II.  She said she really liked their food every time she was in Vegas to try Korean BBQ.  Since she leaves in Korea town in LA & I'm pretty sure that she must have tasted the greatest Korean BBQ in LA.  I was wondering why she wanted to try the food that she could get better ones in K-town? I agreed to have a dinner with her at Ginseng II right after Christmas.  The place was pretty busy with all the tourists.  We all shared some of the dishes including Bibimbap, Kimchi Jjigae, Kalbi, and Chadolbaegi(brisket).  I was amazed that all the dishes we had that night were so delicious!  Especially, the Kimchi Jjigae was outstanding out of all. Kalbi was so tender and tasty.  The side dishes were awesome.  She was right. their food were pretty good comparing to the ones in LA.   I'm really hoping that their food is still great  next time I come back!",

They have a great funny staff normally in the after hours who I think like making fun of my butchering of Korean when I talk to them. I have a blast though.

I ordered the galbi which was ridiculously overpriced. They only brought out a couple pieces of meat and I thought they were joking. The galbi was very tasty, but it ended up being over $30 after tax and tip. The side dishes were pretty good, but the server seemed pissed. Probably because she had to work at four in the morning.  I would probably go here again because it's a nice option in the early hours of the morning in Vegas. However, I would never go here if it were a restaurant in Koreatown or anywhere else. It's way too overpriced and the portions aren't big enough.",

In most Korean restaurants, we typically would ask for refill of at least one or several bukchons.  This time, we didn't.  Hate to continue with our rant, but my partner had a few bites of their Jap Chae, and asked me if we can leave.  It lacked flavor, and was very soggy.

Then again, if you are staying on the strip and don't have a car and need kimchi ASAP, there aren't many other options. Also, you're in Vegas on the Strip. It has to be expensive?  I've been here before on a previous Vegas trip and remember it being good, but don't remember details.  This time, we got yook-gae-jang soup and the hot stone bibimbap. The soup was delicious (and is one of those foods that is pretty easily messed up/not good at restaurants) and had a ton of meat and gosari (braken fern). The bibimbab (a korean restaurant food that's HARD to mess up) was also good and had a nice selection of toppings.  The banchan was good--the soybean sprouts were a little underseasoned for my personal taste (but I prefer this to over-salted!), the kimchi was good (it's not \"ripe\" kimchi fyi), the ggak-doo-gi was delicious, they had the standard Korean-bbq-place potato salad, and they also had muk (a white jelly with soy sauce, nomz).  The service was great when we went, but it was 3pm on a weekday, so it wasn't very busy.  This address is the one right next to/behind the Hawaiian Marketplace! I had trouble distinguishing between the different google/yelp locations that showed up.",

However everytime me and my friends come here to eat after a night out, the lady that serves us is always annoyed of us for no reason.  My friends work in the resturaunt industry so they're very polite and friendly whenever we go out to eat since they know how it is to deal w rude customers.  However the lady at ginseng is just mad at us from the get go.  Whenever we ask for a refill of a side dish or water, she pretends like she doesn't hear us and pretty much ignores us.  If we try to repeat ourselves we get a very mean look and a face of disgust.  As we sat at the table waiting for our grill to be lit she just stood there in the corner of our table doing nothing.  We look at her like what's going on? And she then tells our friend who is sitting on the left corner side of the table to move to the other corner because she can't light the grill...  First off a guest should be able to sit on which ever seat at the given table he pleases, she basically was saying its inconvenient for her to reach over to light the grill so move.  She also kept telling us to be quiet which I guess is understandable because we were talking amongst each other but we were the only people in the resturaunt and it was 4am in Vegas...  Idk.   My friend put it best, it was like we were invited for dinner by a host that didn't want us there and wanted us quiet and we had to make do with whatever we were given to start off with.  The funny thing is all 3 times we went to eat here we always left wondering why the service was so rude and annoyed.  I wonder if it's always the same lady or a few of them that act like this...  But everytime we've went we had this bad expirence with the server.",

Anyway, the wife and I  selected the all you can eat BBQ for 29 bucks. The lady serving us was pretty rude but the food came out timely and we began cooking it at our table. I've been to many Korean BBQ establishments (to include time spent in Korea) and the food here was average at best. My wife really enjoys the side dishes more than the BBQ and asked for more of the cucumber kimchi and more of the goju squid side dish. The server was rude and stated that she could not have more than three servings. What part of all you can eat doesn't apply to side dishes? We also asked for some Soju and she acted like it was a chore to retrieve it as well. We also Never had our water glasses refilled. In fact, she was basically rude the entire meal. The shocker was when we paid and the bill was $100. I paid and left unhappy with the whole experience. Apparently a 16 ounce bottle of soju is 20-30 bucks, smh. I have no problem dropping a couple bills on a meal if the experience and food is deserving (the night before we ate at Craft Steak and dropped a few bills). Ginseng Korean BBQ is one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. You guys suck, a lot.",

It had no flavor to it and eating ice cold soup is just too weird for me. Nasty, I wouldn't order it.  Its also nice because this place is open late night (because everything taste good when you're drunk) so if you're craving korean bbq after the club I would come here . It's convenient and right off the strip.  The only nice thing is they asked our party (of 10) if we wanted separate checks so paying the bill made it very easy.  But overall: service sucks food ain't worth the price ($26 for spicy chicken. Tax/tip included) only good for late night drunkin food",

Yes, they only limit you to two pieces of Galbi per person, but I'm more concerned about the quality than the quantity of meat I have. Aside from Galbi, all their other meats were up for grabs and the quality first class. They first provided us lots of dish condiments and a huge bowl of lettuce salad. I know this is equally bizarre of me to say, but I COULDN'T STOP EATING THE SALAD. My bf gave me the dirty look because he wanted me to eat more meat, but dear god, the salad was just dressed so well and loaded with derishessness! After a long tiresome day baking under the sun, the salad was such a refreshing note to my mouth. Even my bf, who doesn't like vegetables or fruit, ate a few pieces of the salad and liked it. (I must learn the secret recipe.) But aside from the heavenly bliss that is the Korean salad, the Galbi was also very tender and succulent. The bulgogi was probably my favorite, though, in all its mushy glory. Once grilled, it no longer resembled raw mush but soft, flavorful and juicy meat saturated with sauce and doused in the restaurant's seasonings. It complemented our short grain bowl of rice very well. My bf also loved the pork belly meat they provided, so he ordered double amounts of that. We pretty much sampled all the meats on the menu (didn't like the brisket - too tough) and liked everything else (though I'm not a fan of the pork belly.) The condiments, like the usual kimchi, bean sprouts, squash (i think) and other side dishes were equally sublime - good too for indigestion. My bf thought this buffet will only allow you a one hour limit, based on the receipt, but I'm not sure how True that is. Our receipt for The Aria's buffet was limited also to two hours, so I'm not sure if that's really a thing in Vegas or it's just something they write to make sure you don't dally. It didn't matter much to us since we were hungry and thus, ate fast and furiously. Our waitress(es) were very prompt and serviceable and you can adjust the dial on the grill to a setting you like, so no complaints on that end.  This restaurant provided me and my bf a very interactive eating experience with great food, great fun, and great service. I would give 5 stars, but I hesitate to do so because not all of the meat selection was great (brisket, for example) and the Galbi thing was a little disappointing (why label as a buffet when you can't get something for unlimited quantities?) It's roughly $30 pp, which is up there in terms of buffet, so I expected better from them. This doesn't take away from the fact that the food was awesome, though, so I would still come back if I ever go to Vegas again.",

That's when 3 waitresses try to tell me that I already ordered those meats. I respond that I obviously know but want to order MORE. In short, they try to intimidate you to order as little as possible which is crazy at an all you can eat place.

    "text": "This is by far the most awkwardest, hidden, and sketchy Korean bbq yet. I came here late on a Sunday night with my mom and boyfriend. We were seated quickly, yes, but once we got our food, the servers were no where to be seen. We ran out of water a couple times, and the only times we would see the server is when she is rudely cooking our food and flipping our meat around. Aren't the customers the chefs?! Anyways, along with the terrible service came the unbelievable bill of $109. $109 for just 3 people!!!! The food was good, but not as good for the price. It is ridiculous. This includes three $29 ayce plus a $15.00 tip included which was definitely not deserved. Will never be back and if you are reading this, save yourself some money and don't eat here.",

    "text": "I've been to Korea.  I've been to Koreatown in LA, the largest Korean community outside of Korea.  I've had kalbi, Korean BBQ.  I haven't eaten dog, but I've had many Korean dishes and lots of kim-chee.  Let me just tell you, this is the real deal.  In fact, it's better than most Korean BBQ places in Korea because in Korea, the freshness is less and the sanitary protocol, what sanitary protocol???  Have you been to Seoul?  There are places where the sewage is open air.  I'm not kidding.  It reminded me of New Orleans.  You also get much smaller meat portions in Korea.  Now, the price is pretty steep here, $30+ for the BBQ stuff, but the portions are big enough for two people.  I made the catastrophic mistake of ordering their pork belly BBQ AND the dumpling and rice cake soup.  This was a meal for two grown men.    I love the open grill at the table.  This is real Korean BBQ.  If you go to a restaurant and there is no grill at the table, it is fake Korean BBQ.  I wasn't entirely sure of the protocol, but I guess when the waitress doesn't flip the meat, you should unless you want burnt meat.  The kim-chee was on the mild side and not much garlic if any.  Now, it's not authentic, but then again, when you're in Vegas, do you really want garlic breath hitting on women at the clubs?  I think it was a smart move of them.  The food was all fresh.  I'd give them five stars, but I'm not sure they use grass fed hormone free beef and the decor was a bit too casual.  I would have liked less of a strip-mall, lunch cafe feel and more of a dark, dinner restaurant feel.  Service was excellent.  They also have all the major Korean beers and don't worry about the price, they come in large.  I'll hit this place every time I go to Vegas.  I would have also like to see some Korean soaps on a TV or at least some K-pop music.",

Smaller selection on banchan compared to other Korean places. The tofu soup was mediocre-little flavor. The service is about a 2 out of 10. They never checked up on us until we were almost finished and never came to refill our water. A tip: don't use the bathroom if you can hold it. Doesn't seem they upkeep it throughout the day. Trash all over the floor and no toilet paper.",

We ordered the bu go gi, which is my favorite type of Korean BBQ. Since I didn't really want to smell like it, I had them cook it instead of us. THe small dishes that came out weren't as good as other places that I had tried. I don't even remember them coming out with the spicy pickled cucumbers like most Korean restaurants have. The kimchi was also not very spicy.   When we got the bul go gi, it was nicely cooked and a huge portion, but it lacked flavor. We couldn't finish half of it. I also think this place wasn't really worth the money. It was a good portion for two people, but the food was just okay, nothing special.",

The meats were good, the banchan was basic, but passable. A friend had a veggie bibimbap which we all tasted and liked.   The beauty of this place is that it is right on the strip and it is open 24 hours. Yes, you can get your samgyeopsal grilling on at 5am if you really wanted to. It hurts to buy alcohol here. Over $10 for an otherwise $3 bottle of soju. It hurts because on sale at the k-market, you can get 6 for $12... But then again, you are at a restaurant, so you get what you want, for a price.   We had decent service, the ahjummas tolerated us being crazy and would grill our meats like we were rookies. It's all good, we might have been a little lazy and she didn't want us to eff anything up.   All in all a good place. Just wish the price was better.",

They don't let you choose the meat you want, they bring all the meat on the menu they have. Only 5 meats for 27$ and 6 meats for 30$, not including drinks. Drinks are 3$ and they're can drinks so you can't even get refillable drinks. They give you tap water to drink though. If you come with more than 6 people you have to pay 15% more and even if you split up your group and don't sit at the same table they'll charge you extra. The lady who said she owns the restaurant was really rude and didn't listen to us at all or our concerns. It's no wonder the place was absolutely deserted when we arrived. Overall it was a terrible experience and the food was alright but definitely not worth even half the trouble, it ended our first trip to Vegas with a sour note. Be wary of this place.",

We would be cooking our food, flipping the meat, etc, using the tongs and setting them to the side of the grill.  She would come and take the tongs, re-flip the meat we just flipped and put the tongs at the end of the table where she stood, away from us. That happened the whole time.  She told one of my friends to not eat with his hands, only Africans and Filipinos eat with their hands... And they added and automatic gratuity for a party of 5 which we weren't expecting.

The shrimp dumplings are tiny but the order comes with over 15 dumplings. So at 12 bucks it's a steal. The fried dumplings were my least favorite of the two. It did not come out steaming hot. It was more warm and crispy than steaming hot. The fried dumplings come with about 8. These dumplings are a decent size. The filling of the the fried dumplings seem a little bland. It was not stuffed with enough filling as I make at home. Rather the dumpling was filled with more air than stuffing. At 11 bucks the fried dumplings are a cheap way to get your Korean fill on the Vegas strip.",

I come from southern California so I'm used to way way way better ayce kbbq places but even with extremely lowered standards this place is so bad.   There's only 6 options to choose from for 30$ a person; the proteins were not marinated very well and didn't taste good at all. Servers were all over the place and when you start out your order, instead of asking what meats you want they just bring out all 6 choices... I didn't even want pork or chicken but the brought it all out anyways... so make sure you tell them you don't want it so they can take it back instead because if they put it on the grill you have to eat it or else you'll get charged for not finishing your meat.   Also the biggest odd thing is they automatically charge tip to the bill, there was only 2 of us dining...is that even legal?? Tip is optional, and the amount we choose to tip shouldn't be fixed especially when their service is shit.  Do yourself a favor and don't come eat here, don't make the same mistake I did. Because there's plenty of food options in vegas and this is not a good place to eat.",

    "text": "We warn everyone about this place. We came to Vegas for the weekend , we are from la so we have been to several kbbq places before. We arrive , only one 2 groups eating so not busy at all. We were greeted about 2 minutes after arriving. We were seated , given menus and left alone. We were looking for the all you can eat menu. We were trying to get help for about 10 min, while 2 of the waitresses were in the corner gossiping and another was is the corner putting on her lipstick and puckering . After I had to almost scream for some help we asked to see the all you can eat menu, which was rewarded with a annoyed face. She came back gave us menus and walked away, mind that we've been to several kbbq in the past years so we knew what we were looking for . I then asked if they had rice paper  after having to almost hound for help again and with a annoyed look said no. For the amount of $ they were asking for and the customer service we received my gf and I decided to look for another kbbq elsewhere. We found a great one just off the strip. Hope this helps.",

As with any Korean barbecue place you can expect to pay what I consider to be a normal amount of $29 for all-you-can-eat for dinner and $26 for lunch. I would say it's hard to beat. I would have to say also the quality of meat is outstanding. Sometimes you find an all-you-can-eat place they use low-quality meet because they move so much. Here is the exception!  I would highly recommend that when you're in town you should definitely stop in.",

Maybe because this hidden spot is on the main strip of Vegas. We get a lot more for the same price in the Bay Area. AYCE does not included lettuce wraps and radish wraps. Bon Chon is included but not as much as I use to in the Bay.  Food taste good and you will see this spot packed with Koreans so you know it good. Nest time I'll try a la Carte.",

Once again these Korean people do not amaze me as to their poor customer service and how rude they are in treating customers at this location. The food was OK.   Not the best.  I decided to get the all u can eat meal for $29.00.   The place looked dead and the cleanliness was OK.     Here is the big deal .  I had a little food left and I was wondering if I could take it with me ... Anyways a Caucasian couple next to me ask for their food to go and they where able to take it with them.. So I asked to take my little portion and I was denied.   I didn't understand their process and all they said was I couldn't take it and didn't explain as to why.     This is my first time and my last.   I would never eat here again .. I will give my money to another business to try it out.     I ate at the West Gate and also stratosphere.   Those places have good  food to eat and great customer service   This ginseng BBQ place is poor and does not deserve anyone's business.   ..  You have been warned.   Im going to call food inspector on this place .",

I'm sure it's better on average than what I experienced, but my meal there was overpriced and very disappointing.  First and foremost, the condiments were awful - tasted old and not very good to begin with, and the sprouts and the kimchi were basically inedible.  The doeji bulgogi (which, since I was alone and very hungry, was kitchen-prepared) was on the good side of mediocre, somewhat underdone but still satisfying.  With a fair tip (for nice service) and a 36-Oz bottle of OB this disappointing meal came to nearly $40.  I've had the same thing, only much, much better, at dozens of Korean restaurants for about half that.  So I won't be back.",

THE PRICES HERE WERE RIDICULOUS! i mean ouch, $35 something for a small plate of bulgogi..!!! but besides the location and price being horrible, the food was decent and they served us some delicious sides.

In my opinion, it was a horrible decision as of their service.   We had all you can eat for $29, which was decent for korean BBQ. But as the night went on, it was not worth $29. First time the server came and served us quickly with food, but then as we were eating things were running out such as water, napkin, meat, rice, and side dishes. We asked for all those things, and in return, we got what we wanted after 15-25 mins. I mean I asked for refill on the water and napkin for four times. FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES!!  As a hungry/paid customer, I wanted to eat but the server wasn't attentive. It made me not want to eat anymore. after all it was all you can eat right?. if they can serve the food, I don't think it will consider as all you can eat.   Food was okay, wasn't anything special. It was just korean BBQ  At the end of the night, I got the check, and 18% gratuity was on there. In the menu clearly states that if more than 6 people are seated, they will charge gratuity. But it was just two people, and they charged tips on there and didn't say anything to us. I was shocked. I'm not saying this because I'm cheap, they didn't do a job that was worth 18%   Would I be going back? Of course not. Food is important, but service is as important when it comes to restaurant.",

    "text": "Up until now, I've only written positive reviews. For those who might stumble upon my review, chances are you will disregard it anyway. But, that's where Yelp comes in. Not only is it a place to find \"Real Opinions\" by real people, it is also a place where one can leave a \"red flag\" for services received that is . . . bothersome.  It is not unusual to find \"below par\" service from Korean restaurants. The food at this place, I would give 3 stars. The part that bothers me is that when I left the place, rather than feeling like a customer, I was at the Salvation Army Homeless shelter.   After a long day meeting with my own customers during a Fashion Trade Show, I took some customers out for dinner. The place is now a Korean All you can Eat BBQ, so that's what we ordered. I understand the concept of All You Can eat establishments, in which being environmentally efficient, I naturally have the mindset of \"no waste\". Our table, compared to other tables, ordered modestly. But every time the dishes came out, man they were very stingy with the meat!  I looked at other tables, and they seemed normal proportions.   When you order a dish of Sam-Kiup-Sar (Pork Strips), there should be a normal proportion of a dish, that is meant for a table of 4 full grown adults. But, (I think it was the owner lady who brought it) she just brought out 5 pieces..! That is like saying to a (guh-ji = a homeless beggar)  \"here, take these scraps and be gone\".   For a group of 4 adults + drinks + tip = $180  The taste and quality of the food, as I said is like a 3. The service we received is a ZERO.  It gave me a sour aftertaste as I walked out. If it was just me, so be it. But, I felt embarrassed in front of my customers.",

The worst costumer service I have experienced.  After you are seated they will automatically serve you with Rice Tea placed on the table. My wife ask for a glass of water, the waitress said \"Oh you do not like the tea?\" She immediately take the tea and replace it with water without asking if we will still drink the tea. When they served the food, the servers are slamming it on the table. The worst part is, when we got our bill, with out notice they charged us extra for a tip, when we ask they said it is Las Vegas law. There are only 4 persons on the party, so I do not know what kind of required charges they are talking about. It feels like the servers knows that we are not from the area, so they do not really care If you will come back or not as long they got the most out of you. PLUS the food is MEDIOCRE.",

It's in the back of what looks like an abandoned ally/lot. There's lots of options on the menu for Korean dinner and meats. It's about $27 for AYCE which is worth it because most of the a la carte dishes are at least $20/ plate. We decided to order individually instead of doing AYCE because we had 7 people and there's no one we could eat our worth. The soup bowls are medium sized so I suggest sharing one unless you can finish the whole thing by yourself. The shrimp fried rice was surprisingly very flavorful and moist, however, the brisket meat was disappointing. At $25,  we got a medium size plate that resembles the thicker beef slices in pho.   It was mediocre,but we may return to try the AYCE at a future date.",

    "text": "Although we didn't have very high hopes based on the reviews we read, we still wanted to give it a try as it was located roght on the strip in Vegas.  We ordered the grilled chicken and dolsot bibimbap, so this review is limited to those items, the standard side dishes (banchan) and service.  Starting with the good, service was friendly upon entering but since we didn't order the \"All you can eat meat\" special, most of the waitresses were occupied serving those tables. We felt that we had to make an effort to get their attention for water, refills etc.  The dolsot was very disappointing. There was 3 veggies (mostly mushrooms, chinese broccoli and bean sprouts), about 2 tablespoons of meat and an overcooked egg. Typically, bibimbap has 5-7 veggies that include 2-3 root veggies, spinach, beansprouts, carrots, leafy lettuce, and egg that is almost raw so that when you mix it all up, it blends and cooks in the hot bowl.  The small portion of grilled chicken was overcooked/dry and was served on a plate. Judging by how quickly the food came out, it was likely precooked and sat around.  Finally, the banchan (side dishes) was very mediocre. There was only 5 or 6 compared to a good place where 10-12 is standard for dinner. This seems to be the place for big meat eaters who  want quantity, as the \"All you can eat BBQ\" is $28 per person.   But if you enjoy the other Korean specialties like soups, rice/noodle dishes, fish, appetizers etc., I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  While I didn't eat the other items, if a restaurant cannot do a basic/popular dish well, its usually not a good sign.",

First of all, I'm guessing that she assumed we were Korean tourists, so she tried to rip us off. Second, it was only a party of 5 NOT SIX. We shouldn't be automatically charged with tip when we don't even have more than 6 people. So the original price should be about 73-74 dollars, but the bill came out to ninety something dollars ( almost hundred ).

    "text": "SERVICE: Fantastic. I don't walk into too many KBBQ places that have hostesses who cook and serve you the food. Our hostess checked in on us periodically to cook the meats and make sure we were satisfied with everything else on the table. It also helps to have a ringer button on the wall so you can ring them for things like water refills or meat orders when they're busier and less attentive.   FOOD: The meats are not exceptionally marinated or seasoned but the spicy pork and kalbi (short ribs) are still very good. The unseasoned thin slices of steak can be a tad dry so dip it in the bean sauce or sesame oil. I think my least favorite meat from the All You Can Eat menu is the pork belly. It's almost completely just fat. I did enjoy, however, the unlimited salad that comes with the meal. It's chopped lettuce dressed in a spicy vinegar and oil. Light, refreshing and a perfect compliment to the barbequed meats. It's important to note that their prices have risen within the past year or so. The AYCE option used to be around $22-24/person I think. Now it's $30, so eat your fill.   (this is why I'm giving it 3 stars, though it can arguably be 4 stars when taking everything into consideration)  ATMOSPHERE: The place has off-white tiled floors, oil stains on some of the glass round the place, and no music or anything. It's not much to look at but for a KBBQ place that opens 24hrs, I don't think 'atmosphere' should be something to concern yourself with.   If you're looking for some good grub on at 2am in the morning after a hard night of partying, I recommend this place.",

First there's only 2 table customer at 7:30 pm dinner time so I was kind of hesitant because good Korean Restaurant is always busy you even have to wait sometimes. My guts is right. First It's s huge mistake the quality of the food is awful very very salty (not good for people have high blood issues) all of the items they served except the rice. It's very expensive and they include the tip right away maybe because of poor service and poor quality it's not worth $30 pp will never never go back again. My mistake I didn't check the reviews",

I have no major negatives to say about the restaurant but it just didn't have the quality that I usually look for in KBBQ. The staff was nice enough and the service was good but the restaurant could use some updating for sure. It's very bright and stark inside with not much character. They're in a great location on the strip with tons of foot traffic, but there were next to no other patrons inside while we were there. I think if they refreshed the interior and sourced some higher grade meat they could attract a much broader and more affluent crowd. I would easy pay more for a better quality experience in the future.",

My boyfriend's father (who has never had Korean food before) commented on how the place looked \"sketchy\" but I shut him down when I told him \"You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover...it could very well be a diamond in the rough!\" We were promptly seated-probably case it was 10:00 P on a Tuesday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  That's OK though...that means we don't have to wait hours for a check or refills on water, etc.  Since my dining companion never had Korean food, I suggested ordering the AYCE Barbecue which was only $21.95!!  Our server brought out the banchan and started the grill.  The meat she brought were Bulgogi, Samgyeopsal, and Galbi....we didn't want any of the other meats.  I was ready to cook our own meats, but our server was gracious  enough to do it for us.  It was like having a meal in my mom's or aunt's house (both are Korean).  My dining companion couldn't get over how good everything was: the food, the experience, the price.  He even talked about it the next day and said it was such a unique experience.  Thank you Ginseng Korean BBQ II for making me look good.",

(lol/jk) But since we only ordered two types of meat it only came with two bowls of rice, so i had to pay extra. It wasn't served with lettuce or salad, it cost $5 more. This was the type of place that you just had to pay extra for anything extra. I guess I was expecting all you can eat type places that I'm more use to. Other than that, the meat portions was plentiful.   The server started off fairly rude to us and after a while she finally warmed up but it was already to late to leave a good tip :(",

Note for those who want to try this place, be prepared for a long wait at least for dinner when we went there. When you walk into a Korean restaurant and most of the customers are Korean, you know you're in the right place for some authentic cuisine.    The two dishes that stood out for me were 2 pork dishes.  The first pork dish was mixed with rice cake and cabbage and was stewed in a kimchi sauce.  The tender pork had a kick to it, but also sweet at the same time.  Very traditional Korean food. I was hesitate to try dishes mixed with kimchi, but this was surprisingly good.  The second pork dish was spicy and grilled with onions. The sauce was more spicy than the first.  It was a simple combination, but great.  Both dishes were similar, however I didn't' mind eating it twice.    I've had some really great seafood tofu soup and this place was definitely on par.  The soup wasn't watered down and had a strong flavor. And they didn't put too much vegetables overpowered the seafood flavor.    Though i would say this place is a bit more expensive then the ones I've been to at home, but it's Vegas. Overall, I would say that this place would be a great pit stop on my next Vegas trip.  Another great thing is that this place is 24hr, so you can come visit here after a long night of Vegas fun! :-)",

You have to holla (or push the button) to get their attention.  They understand both english and korean.  Food is good but pretty pricey.  Kalbi is $35...bulgogi is $24... But I would pay anything to get my cravings met.  The 4 stars is mainly for the availability and lack of competition for this restaurant.",

    "text": "The food was good, service was okay, prices were high (hey, you're on the Strip!). But overall, it was worth getting out of the rat race of restaurants for a nice, quiet, chill dinner atmosphere.   A lot of people here address poor customer service.  We initially had the same thoughts. But then decided that since we've only been to tiny Korean restaurants where we live where the owner takes care of you and you don't worry about the menu, maybe we aren't familiar enough with their culture to judge the service as \"bad\".   One of our group doesn't eat meat, so ordered a seafood dish and was given what we perceived as a bit of grief. There was no help offered in choosing a seafood dish. We later decided our Korean server probably didn't intend this, and service improved with the more our group ate of the meat and side dishes.     Going to Ginseng is definitely a cultural experience. The AYCE BBQ has 5 different meat choices, and if you don't specify your preference (the bulgogi was perfection!), they'll start you at the beginning and keep feeding you until you are in a meat-sweat-coma.  And I mean keep feeding you a lot! The BBQ is cooked on a grill on your table and is pretty cool!   We didn't even look at the later pages of the menu where prices got into the $30-50 range. This was for hot pots and other dishes.   3 stars because the food was good, service was okay but could improve, and the menu was confusing for us, plus we were discouraged from ordering from it (they wanted everyone to order the AYCE). We would go back, but we'd do research on what we'd want to order first! If you go, make sure to specify your preferred meat first so you can really enjoy it. Also make sure to brush up on Korean menu knowledge as the menu, even with English translation, is overwhelming if you don't eat Korean all the time.",

I've been to many KBBQ places, but I have never seen KBBQ to be $30+. It's not very surprising that this place would be $$$, I mean almost everything on the Strip is PRICEY. Since $30 for a very small portion of kogi was definitely out of the question, I decided to order dolsot bimbimbap instead. This dolsot bimbimbap was the most expensive I have ever paid for. There's nothing special about this place. I'm giving it two stars because the food was descent and the waitress was nice enough to be honest about size portion of the KBBQ meat. Never again.",

Always do the AYCE plus an order of tongue.  Sometimes I axe the spicy pork because I suffer from it the next day.  Love the green salad since it's very refreshing compared to all the hot and spicy and I love all the banchan that comes with it.  To me the portions of each meat is enough so after all courses have been cooked and ate (including 2-3 bottles of soju) I'm good to go.  For those questioning the lack of marinade, those particular cuts are supposed to be unseasoned.  That's what the dipping sauces are for if you want more flavor, IMO.  Yeah it's not cheap but it's Vegas so I'm not here to penny pinch.  We have pretty good KBBQ in Hawaii and I've been to many in LA (awesome) so yeah this place is not as good but it works for me as my go to in Vegas.",

The side dishes are adequate and plentiful, and there is a nice selection of Korean and Japanese Beers to compliment the meal. IMHO this place is good if you just need a Korean BBQ Fix, but it isn't going to wow a seasoned KBBQ Eater. I prefer Kimchi at the other end of the Strip, but if I'm in the area and craving KBBQ, I will stop here and partake of their offerings. Overall this would not be a bad dinner choice for most people just looking for a different experience. True KBBQ Fans however will most likely be unimpressed.",

I have never been to a korean bbq labeled as an \"all you can eat\" and then slapped with a \"2 piece limit for LA Galbi per person.\" This place was a joke!   I got the brisket which is normally good, I mean, how can you go wrong with thin un-marinated meat? Boy, was I wrong. It was super chewy and tasted old. The samgyupsal, or the bacon, was the same way. And the 2 pieces of galbi should have been out of this world-amazing, since they limit you in it. Nope! It was thinly sliced and full of fat. The flavor was off.   I spent $30 on the bbq and didn't even eat it. On top of that, within a few hours I felt completely sick to my stomach. Terrible!",

Everyone in sight was Korean,which is always a good indicator when you're going to a Korean place. Everyone was attentive and take care of you. Mind you this is an Asian place,so they don't do small talks or entertain you in ways Western places do. They will help you cook your meat and attend to what you need. Language barrier is of course there,but come on who speaks perfect English? Our service was impeccable and they actually gave me an extra piece of Galbi (2 servings limitation per person).  They have killer squid salad as a banchan and they gave me an extra for free. I would have eaten more if I had more space in the tummy. Will definitely go back anytime I'm in town.",

When we went there she mentioned it and told us we needed to be done in 45 minutes so they can make room for the party of 100. I was hesitant but she said it's plenty of time for all you can eat. During the meal it felt rushed. She brought out the meat and checked on us. She cooked the meat on the grill for us but she was rushing the process as she piled on different cuts. They were also  cheaping out on the sides and didn't bring out more when we asked. That day we had a terrible stomach ache and we assumed it was either from uncooked meat or how unsanitary the grill was. The grilling table was covered in old fat and oils that was pooling around it. We were pretty disappointed since we were looking forward to an all you can eat kbbq.",

Also their Hot Pot looked good too. I'll probably give this another shot on a future visit.",

    "text": "Although not the most impressive all you can eat korean BBQ restaurant that I have ever tried, I have to give this place credit for offering a different all you can eat option than the standard Las Vegas buffets in the area.  Visitors to this restaurant could either order regular dishes from a standard menu, or select the all you can eat meat options. We tried the AYCE option, which consisted of 5 meat options, including brisket, short rib (kalbi), and bulgogi. The meat was good, but not as good quality or fresh as compared to other places that I tried in the past. They offered a good selection of slides, and offered a salad with a nice light dressing. The restaurant charged $29 per person, which was pricier than typical restaurants of this type, but its high prices were understandable given that it was located on the Strip.   The restaurant itself was comfortable and quiet, unlike many of the korean BBQ restaurants on the east coast. Service was also excellent as well - they frequently stopped by to ask for our next meat selections and to refill our sides and dipping sauces.   Tip - even though you might be tempted to try to eat $29 worth of meats, it is a far more pleasant experience to eat only as much as your stomach can comfortably tolerate. Do not make the same mistake of overeating like we did, or you may have regrets days afterwards.",

Its tucked away behind the Fatburger on Las Vegas Blvd.  We were walking there for dinner and couldn't see it at first but ultimately spotted it.  For a 3 stars its not because of their food I can tell you that.  I didn't get a stomach ache or any problems at all which is rare for kbbq for me.  The knock seems to be the price which is about 30 to 40 bucks a person.  Thats insane especially where I'm from its no more than 20 all you can eat but being the only one on the strip it makes sense.  Service was excellent.  I mean outstanding.  They were so nice and accommodating towards us I was almost in shock.  The meats were all delicious and they even stop by and cook it for you.  You literally just eat.  This place is pretty awesome.  To be honest I didn't mind paying 40 bucks for this anyways.  I really missed kbbq and rice and tofu soup during my stay in Vegas.    The tables were clean, the seats were so spacious and comfortable.  This place delivers on everything.  The brisket sauce tastes the way it should too.  The tofu soup was ordered separately though but it comes in a giant bowl, enough for two people.  This was one of the highlights of my vacation for sure.  Overall, the only kbbq spot on the strip so expect high prices.  With that in mind you pretty much get your moneys worth as the food is quite delicious.  Its located near the Fatburger.  I would be back again.  If I had it my way, I would have eaten it every night.",

I'm from California but I can't even lie, the meat here is so much better than anywhere in LA's K-Town or all the places on Colima in Rowland Heights.   The service is a lot better here too. Back home all the ahjummas ignore you even if you're Korean, but the employees here were really attentive, particularly Esther. Not sure if she's the only Esther there since every other Korean female has that name, but you'll know who I mean if you get her as your server! She's extremely nice and she even flips the meat for you! This is like full service kbbq (unless it's like this outside California? lol)  Onto the meat- the kalbi is limited to 2 pieces per person (and you can only get it one time, so 3 people would only get 6 pieces total during their entire stay), but I don't mind because I can't find kalbi and all the other meat of this quality for $30 back home. The other meats from the AYCE menu were equally delicious and didn't really need to be seasoned or dipped in anything because they already had so much flavor. My sauces were basically untouched, which never happens for me.  I saw their sign near Fatburger but it took me a while to find it, then I found out it was behind Walgreens /o\\  It's really hidden so I feel like a lot of people would miss out on this (along w/ the fact that people don't usually come to Vegas for kbbq).  All in all, great food and great service. There's no competition unlike the kbbq places back in LA/RH but they still give their all here, which I really appreciate.  And they also have legit spoon and chopstick boxes! I don't go to enough LA spots to know about every restaurant, but they definitely don't have those in any of the Rowland restaurants. That gives it a more authentic feel to me. Small things like that and kimchi quality (which is great here) already let me know if a place will be worthy or not.",

I thought that their (banchan) side dishes were pretty good. The only thing was that they put an egg in my tofu soup in which I normally leave it out.

And the price. Jesus. 16$ for a bibimbap. Ridiculous. Far as food goes, banchan was pretty lame. Nothing fancy. Bibimbap sauce was ehhhh. Nothing stood out on the ingredients neither.",

But the grill was pretty tiny for a group of 6. Took too long to cook everything. Partially because the girl kept coming around and turning down our heat. They didn't want us to have anything nicely seared... Just that awkward grey color. We also opted for the all you can eat for $30 per person. What they meant was all they wanted us to eat. We wanted more short ribs and were told we already exceeded our limit? Huh? We were only allowed 2 scrawny pieces a person. My bad... I was busy cooking for the rest of the group... Guess I missed out on my two pieces. Now that I think about it, I think that they were turning down our heat so we would eat slower. Then my friends wanted dessert. They don't have dessert. Sigh... Not horrible however so many amazing places I'm not in a hurry to go back.",

Location is not that hard to find. There's a giant sign with red text out front (next to the old Walgreens and fat burger), pretty much dead opposite the Monte Carlo.  There's a parking lot that tells you to pay $5 for parking, but when I went there I didn't see anywhere to pay... So it was free...  Service is fast and friendly with many banchan refills.  Just don't expect to get hovered over like you would at an American chain restaurant.  You can always push the button if you can't flag down a waitress.   Highly recommended.  I am so, so thankful to have wholesome Korean food like this on the strip.",

(Their name is visible in Korean on the shopping center sign I believe.)  It's a spacious venue, and I saw a decent crowd of Koreans serving AND dining, always a good sign.  We opted for BBQ. Our kalbi's marinade was spicy spicy spicy! The banchan plates were good, too (mmmmmm kimchi). Surprisingly, this restaurant charges for lettuce. (Yes, lettuce. I've never seen that before! A friend actually ordered the lettuce... high-roller!)  Service was fine, the servers even cooked the meat we ordered on our table grills. (My friend won a LOT of money and the servers got excited when he showed us his high-value chips, even coming around to the table more often, hah!)  Despite the high prices for meat (and, c'mon, lettuce?), good service, and delicious meats, this is a great place for Korean BBQ, late night or otherwise. Recommended!",

It was good to take a break from the buffets, and the prices are fair. Food was average, service was okay. The boricha barley tea was very weak, which is why someone wrote a tip complaining of the horrible \"water\". The fun part of the experience was seeing two tables of very loud, very drunk Asians, which I have to say I don't usually see in Atlanta Korean restaurants.

At 2am, there was one lady serving everyone and she was in a grouchy mood, maybe no sleep? The side dishes were limited and when we asked for other options, she said there weren't any. It's hidden in a little alley and not very clean, but most Korean places are like this, except that their food is usually delicious, even at 2am. If you really want Korean, have your cab driver take you off the strip in to China Town right there on Spring Mountain road - shouldn't be more than a $15 cab fare, just remember to get their card so you can call for a ride after.",

Note: You have to pay $5 for parking but if you eat here you can get it back from the parking attendant.   We came here during brunch time so it wasn't that busy. The service was good and the waitress came by often to check up on us.   The general consensus was that the food was decent. We ordered traditional jjigaes, bibimbap, and naengmyun. They give you pretty big portions; I wasn't able to finish my Haemul Soondubu (Seafood Tofu Soup). I've had better Tofu Soup elsewhere however. Still, I was satisfied and left very full.   The prices seem to be higher than what I usually pay for Korean food in SoCal but then again, we're in Vegas.   It's a good option if you are craving Korean food and don't want to drive too far off the strip. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars.",

For an All You Can Eat buffet, their menu only offered 5-6 items if I remember correctly for $29/person. I would say it was worth for the amount of food but the other 5 friends I was with said it wasn't. Their portions are HUGE compared to the AYCE buffets I've been to in Houston and they limit you 1.5 hours to order and eat and then you're cut off after that. We ended up only ordering 1 round since that was all our stomachs could handle. The quality of the meats were pretty good along with the marinade for an AYCE. Don't really have any complaints besides the amount they brought out all at once. It was kind of intimidating especially if they've made it clear that you're going to be charged extra for not finishing what you've ordered.  A little upset thinking back that I could've gotten more with the $30 if we had eaten somewhere else . .  If half stars were possible, I'd give it 3.5 !! It wasn't a horrible experience but I would've just wished I felt like I ate my $30 worth.",

It's open 24/7 and it's Korean BBQ so my fiance and I were excited to find it open nearby, while walking the strip. When we arrived we were sat completely far away from everyone else, in addition, we were not even provided water or acknowledged after waiting over 20 minutes! I'd understand if the place was busy.... but it wasn't.  Not sure if our race had anything to do with it BUT we were the only Latinos there - the rest of the customers were Asians and were sat near each other. I don't want to claim such a thing from a business but it truly was difficult to not feel some type of way while there.   Honestly, we were willing to wait as long as we were at least acknowledged and provided the same customer service as we SAW and HEARD the waitress provide the other customers there.   We ended up walking out after waiting for such a long while with no acknowledgement.   Definitely not returning.",

Since it's a 24 hour restaurant, I'm sure they get busy at odd hours but I was just there at high noon on a Saturday. They weren't too busy but still well staffed, ready for any customer fluctuations.   The service couldn't be any better. I was intimidated by all the \"all you can eat\" and bbq options upon entering the establishment. Someone greeted me (on top of the automated door chime) and made me feel at home quickly.  Attentive, available, knowledgeable, and friendly.   Yes, they have food items a la carte too. One does not have to do all you can eat. The prices for the individual items were more than reasonable for the amount of food provided as well as all the unlimited side dishes that are included.   Warning! This place is authentic. The flavor and spice are Korean. Not a Tex-orean place! So if you love the real flavor of Korean food and can handle the spice on items they mark with a fire, you're going to love this place! If you've been training your pallet and think you're ready for the real stuff, this is also your chance!",

We went with the AYCE. There were 2 different options for AYCE, only difference was the kalbi that was on the more expensive option.  There were 6 different meats to choose from the expensive menu. The only downside to this was that the lady didn't allow us to order what we wanted, instead she told my husband, \"no worry, I bring out everything.\" Whhhhaaaattt?!?! Okay, whatever. The first thing she brought out was the pork belly and brisket and HOLY MOLY was that a HUGE portion of pork belly.  Then we started to get worried because if the portions were that big, we couldn't eat everything and that we'd be charged.  Luckily, the lady stopped bringing meats after the third one because it was a lot! Even though we had 4 people, that was a lot of food!  All the meats were good especially the kalbi, it was tender!  Unless you eat a lot, I recommend that you go with more than just 2 people.  Overall friendly service!",

I went in just before noon, there was not too many people inside but there was Korean tv station on so I knew it was authentic. I did not order ayce but just the chadol, galbi and pork belly all unmarinated. Everything was very good. The service was excellent. I Would recommend for a good priced authentic meal.",

It's \"all you can eat\" food with small portion sides you'll have to stretch if you plan on eating more than one round. After the second meat, i decided to play it safe and order shrimp fried Rice; it was 11 and they quit making fried rice at 10....but the place is open 24 hours?! Why don't you let people know what you can order between which times?",

    "text": "This place is awful. Deserves a one star.   Let me paint out the story for you: My boy and I had a longgggggg night going out this weekend and somehow we ended up hungry at 6:30 in the morning. Despite the three star rating warnings I was seeing on here, we decided to go anyway due to photos of the food.   Mistake number 1.   We get there and it's empty (of course. 6:30 am.) and no one is at the front desk. The guy cleaning calls the host lady to come to the front and she looks particularly uninterested to help us. And by particularly- I mean she was NO help.   I told her this was my first time here and asked if they had a carry out menu or just a menu to look at so I could figure out what to order. Mind you there's menus right by the register and she says \"no carry out menus. Only menu on the wall.\" And points. I go to look at it and turn back to ask her something and she's ALREADY walking back into the kitchen. And the bad part is she was in there for a while and didn't come out until the dude signaled her AGAIN.   So this time I was asking her between two chicken dishes of which would be the better pick and she standoffishly said she doesn't know. So when I asked which she would choose or which people order she simply said \"I don't even like chicken.\" After that I asked if there were any photos of the meals available to help me choose which I think would be more appetizing, she ups and walks away from me midsentence and starts going back to doing what she's doing and doesn't come back.   At this point we just throw the business cards away they had right on the floor and walk out. We've never had such terrible service anywhere. And as two men of color, I feel like that was some racial profiling service. I'd never go back there and I recommend anyone else not give them any business if they think this is how customers should be treated.",

    "text": "Literally THE best hangover food ever. If this place ever closed down, vegas just would not be the same.   Located right on The Strip, next to the big Walgreens, it is kind of hidden but not (if that made any sense at all). It's in an alley way that leads to a huge parking lot, if you're driving or getting dropped off.   I'd say, it is more like a 3.5 stars than a 3. 3.5 stars if you're comparing it to anywhere else (ie. LA) but 4 stars for vegas food, if you know what I mean.   The food is good, it is. Actually, it's DELICIOUS post drinking. I always get the Mandoo Gook, which is a dumpling soup filled with meat and glass noodles. The dumplings are HUGE and the portion is incredibly generous. It isn't too salty or full of msg which is always a plus for me. I've also tried the Doenjang Jigae (soyabean paste soup) which is pretty good too but a little on the salty side.   My only question is WHY DONT THEY DO DELIVERY?!? They are clearly catering to tourists or hungover people (being 24hours AND on the strip), they might as well take it one step further.  Anyways, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come here if I actually lived in vegas but as a tourist staying on the strip, this is not only something I'd settle for but a very good option.",

We called ahead to make sure they were open and yes was the answer I wanted to hear.  From the M & M Factory we made our way and when we got there, every seat was taken.  Good sign.  Our wait was only 10 minutes, we sat down and the server arrived with glasses of water within minutes.  The place was packed with a lot of people there, we knew this place had to be good.   The menu is like any menu you see at other Korean restaurants so it was hard to decide what we wanted.  I wanted Dolsot Bibimbap and my BF had Bulgogi.  It took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and I must say, that is the best Dolsot I ever had.  Everything was tasty.",

They sat us right away even though we were still waiting for a few more people in our party. It was a Sunday evening about 9pm wasn't too busy. We all got the AYCE KBBQ. Our server was nice and even helped us cook some of the meat on the grill. Only thing was she would come and start flipping the meat over on our grill with her arm all in my way as I was trying to eat...Mind you she never even said excuse me. Food was ok nothing amazing I've had better. They never even asked to refill any of our stuff we had to ask for more salad, more meat, water and ask to change our grill out. Anyways, So when it came time to pay the hostess handed us our check stating that the gratuity was already added on our bill. Please keep in mind we only had a party of 5 total. The gratuity the added was about 15%. I asked the hostess why was there a Required gratuity when we didn't even have a party of 6 or more. Then she said it's actually 5 or more in Vegas. I go to Vegas a lot and I've NEVER heard of this before. Then she even said that some places it's 4 or more where it's mandatory gratuity. They don't even have a sign or anything stating this \"gratuity requirement\" anywhere on the menus or restaurant. We always tip but not 15% when the service was not all that great!   This has nothing to do with our service but we even seen one of the servers sneeze in her hand and wiped it on her apron and kept working and even grabbed a fork. That's disgusting; poor sanitary practice.   Never coming here again and would not recommend this place to anyone!",

Kimchi BBQ's one hour time limit, self-serve panchan, and recent closing due to health concerns didn't seem too appealing.  They're open 24 hours, so we arrived very late on a weekday, and we were the only ones there. We ordered the samgyupsal (pork belly) and spicy pork. Prices are definitely higher than expected, and we also paid extra for salad. Two bowls of rice are included, but if you have more people, that will cost more, too. It did not come with any kind of soup, so we ordered kimchi jjiggae on the side. The panchan (side dishes) were not too bad, except for the kimchi! All of it was super sour, which was disappointing. On the plus side, the meat was worth the price- we received decent-sized portions, and the spicy pork was seasoned very well.   Our waitress did all of the cooking, and she politely chatted with us. She was great about refilling our panchan as needed. No problems there. It's not the best Korean BBQ experience, but it's passable.",

They are Korean, most of them don't even speak very good English that's why they don't really talk to you. I came here a few times, got used to their services. And I was just here a couple of days ago. After dinner, we left and only realized that one of my friend left her cellphone in the restaurant. When I called right after we realized it, a lady by the name of Me....something, can't really remembered her name (sorry) picked up the phone and confirmed that they did found the phone. And surprisingly she even told me that we left an envelope of money too. I thanked her for letting me know caused we didn't realized that money in the envelope was also left behind. I just really want to thank them for their honesty. I would recommend my friends here anytime. Thank you again.",

    "text": "I LOVE KOREAN BBQ!!!  Much thanks to David B. for Yelping about this place.  Now there are 2 kinds of places that I know - (1) a place where you get more bang for your buck (cheap but great food) and (2) a place that's on the pricey side but worth every penny.  This place was the latter.    My boyfriend and I arrived in Vegas past midnight and were famished.  I was telling him that one of my Yelp friends know of a really good Korean BBQ place and it was within walking distance from our hotel.  Naturally I was excited to try it.  Holy cow, fellow Yelpers weren't kidding when they said it was open 24 hours!  We came in around 1:30am and even though it looked empty, there were a few patrons inside.  We ordered the Bul Go Gi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw?userid=sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EkuS...</a>) and Galbi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw?select=G7yMbx5OU_qBHH-3cxWopA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EkuS...</a>).  It's been such a long time since I've had great tasting Korean BBQ and this place did not disappoint at all.  It was beyond my expectation... purely and utterly delectable.  The Bul Go Gi was well seasoned and marinated; the last bite was as great as my first.  Plus, I don't normally like Galbi, but I like it here... so yummy!  Like ravenous vultures, we pigged out and had a lip-smacking good time.  I wouldn't mind being Lil' Miss Piggy again and come back for more.  FYI - This place was expensive; approximately $28 for Galbi and $25 for Bul Go Gi.  But I honestly think that we got what we paid for.  However, minus 1 star because the service wasn't as stellar as the food.  There were only a handful of us and it still took forever to get the bill.  I now have my late night hot spot in Vegas.  Thanks again David!!! =)",

The bulgogi was soooo tasty, very tender and perfectly flavored. The meal also came with banchan, which was okay. I liked the cucumbers but found the other vegetables to be too heavily flavored, all in that spicy sauce. Our waitress was really nice and attentive too, and helped us cook the meat properly. I was pleasantly surprised to find good quality food open 24 hours...unlike at Irvine ;)",

That was a waste of time since Tofu Hut wouldn't serve me AYCE BBQ because I was dining alone.  I was ticked off and took an Uber back to Aria.  What a waste of time and money that was!  On the drive back, I saw Ginseng Korean BBQ just across the street from Aria and decided to try it out.  It was a little expensive at $29.99 for dinner, but being located on the Strip, I would expect it to cost more.  The food was good, but the selection of meat was very limited.  There was only five meats, and one of the BBQ strips they limit you to two pieces only.  The other four meats were sliced beef and chicken in a soy sauce, pork belly and brisket.  They also served the usual side dishes but did not have my favorite, the fish cake.  Although the meat selection was limited, the service was very good.  There were quite a few waitresses and they were very attentive.  They even came by my table and cooked some of the meat for me.  Whenever I asked for more meat, it was promptly delivered.",

Now I can't claim I have eaten it all one the world like some people or had it at 50 million other better places but I do know good food when I eat it. We sat down at looked over the menu and could make up our minds so we went with the AYCE for 22 bucks. Not a bad deal for BBQ or a strip restaurant. They brought out the sides like normal the only thing they didn't have that we normally get is the potatoes, theirs where spicy. i don't mind but she doesn't like them like that. We know what we are doing when it comes to this but let the server cook it for us anyway. She did a good job and was very attentive to our food while still taking care of others. We only made it throughout the first heaping mound plate of food and were stuffed to the gills. We left happy and will defiantly be back on the next trip to Vegas.",

Then ordered a vegetable dish for our vegetarian friend ..the only thing mentioned on the menu was vegetables....guess what? it was full of clams!   If my wife, who is allergic to shell fish had eaten it we would have been in the emergency room. They took that off the check but insisted we were told that, despite the fact it was not listed on the menu, the dish came with clams. Yea right! Sides were OK but nothing special compared with any other Korean restaurant. I would say with so many great options around save your money and go someplace else",

The spicy pork was a HUGE portion and really satisfying with a great hot flavor. When our banchan would get low the waitresses would replenish them quickly. As such, I ate a whole bowl of kimchi to myself :D omnomnom! We cooked the food at our table and gobbled it up quickly.

The pork belly was a bit dry (not sure if it was our bbq-ing skills, or if it was just because it was thick and not marinated), but the chicken and brisket were amazing!

The All-you-can-eat has an hour time limit and they started serving our food in about 20min without asking what dishes we wanted. Besides, we ordered appetizers separately, they finally served the appetizers when we were almost done with the meal (we had rushed them serval times so we got our food). During the meal they served food very slowly and never checked up on us. We did not really enjoy the meal because we had to rush for food and water, and we did not get service from them.  The most impressive thing happened. We paid by cash with 13% tip.  (I know that I should have paid 15% for dinner, but they did not give us service so I think it is reasonable to pay less) They stopped us from leaving because we did not pay 18% tip. The lady explained that there is 18% gratuity with party of 6 or more. And our table is for 6 people, so we must pay 18% tip. I told them that we did not choose our table and there were only four of us so the gratuity rule did not apply on us. We were not happy about their service so I put down the amount I thought they deserved. Then she started being mad, gave us an attitude and said something angrily in her language.   I think it was just a very horrible experience in a trip and I will not recommend friends to come because of the awful service.",

But if you're in vegas and looking for Korean food -it fills the need. It's decent. Nothing stellar.  We (4 of us) had to ask for an extra set of banchan (side dishes) and despite some protest, we got it. They also forgot to give us the seasoned salad that's usually standard with bbq but when we asked we got it.  The main star here is the Eun Dae Gu Jorim (see pic) - it's flaky white fish stewed with radish and tofu and you just can't get that on the east coast! I've only had it here and I come back every trip (twice a year) to eat this. Mix the leftover sauce with your rice.",

This place is 24/7 and probably one of the only Korean options on the strip (everything else is arguably \"Asian fusion\"). Big seating area so no wait at all. Service is pretty good also.   We arrived in Vegas around 12am, so in reality 3am our biological clock time. Definitely a bit mentally disengaged from the party/gambling scene...just hoping to eat and rest up for a packed morning after. All the dishes here are above average; the soondubu was particularly soothing. LA Galbi and pajeon were just right and helped fill our stomachs after a starving travel. The three dishes came out to around $50-60. Not bad  Highly recommended should this place be your after-flight (and night? dare i say) cure",

    "text": "AYCE KBBQ open 24hrs!!!!  Unlike many of the strip restaurants which are jam packed during dinner hours, Ginseng was almost empty.  It was prefect for my hungry group, no reservations, and we were seated promptly after arrival.    The all you can eat menu is very limited to just 6 items.  For what it lacks in options, it picks up in quality, for parts of the menu that is.   - Bulgogi - The best meat in my opinion.  Loaded with green and white onions, it made for the best tasting meat option.   - Brisket - pretty average, not much to say anything about.   - Spicy pork - again, average option, not much going with the meat or marinate.   - LA Galbi - the bone-in short ribs were pretty legit, close second to the bulgogi.   - Pork belly - overly fatty.  More fat than meat, on the disappointing end.   - Marinated Chicken - I usually steer clear of chicken at KBBQ because of the longer cooking time.  The chicken and marinate we're definitely above my expectations.  I'm pretty spoiled by the dime a dozen KBBQ spot's in LA with great quality, so my review might be a bit biased.  Overall, the food is decent, if you're looking to fill yourself to the brim full meat, I'd say this is the place for you.  It is on the expensive side, the time I went it was $23 per person, now it's $29 per person.",

When i got here, it wasn't too busy. it was maybe 930 at night. i was excited to try this place out and was starving since i knew i was going to a ayce I'm not going to eat alot during the day. i went in and had requested the ayce menu since that wasn't handed to me. they gave me the regular side order menu with most dishes average 15 to 20 bucks for one entree. i knew i would add a few more bucks for a better deal.   the inside is pretty much section off into your own table with a seating of four for most kbbq tables. they are roomy and do have lots of space for groups or small parties as well. the parking is in the back of the building. it was next to a club called krave, not sure if the club still exists. but this place is hidden and isn't easily spotted on the strip. they do have a sign with red letter outside the plaza. finding this place might be a bit tricky. the nearest casino would be mgm, if i remember correctly.   next i sat down and waited patiently for the food to arrive, and the servers were on break eating their dinners. i saw them eating their k bbq food and grilling it up. they had brought the raw meat and placed it all on the bbq and cooked it for me. i didn't do much because each time i try to flip it they come over and take the tongs and flip it for me. i wish i can go on my own pace then them serving it all the time. i felt like i was in a rush to stuff everything in my face at once. i can remember the meat was awesome and it was good. the texture and flavor was on point. i did ask for seconds of the side dishes which was the bean sprouts and pickled spicy cucumbers and kimchi as well. i know it was some good stuff. when i asked for more they don't acknowledge you but they do bring it to you. it felt like they didn't like it much or maybe just tired. the customer service is so so and kind of rude if i have to say so.   i did have a good experience and i did eat a few rounds before i called quit. it was nice they do honor one person customers for the k bbq. unlike some places in LA, where they don't honor one person ayce bbq. it did satisfy my craving for kbbq in vegas. i did end up finding a much friendlier environment for kbbq with much more food in vegas later on. if you ask me if i would do a repeat of this place, i rather travel a bit further out the strip to get some better and more food for the ayce. Thanks for reading. add me or follow me if you haven't.",

This is truly a hidden gem of a restaurant on the Strip, just behind a random Walgreens on the broke side of the street. There is free customer parking too, almost unheard of on the Strip. It is never crowded, it feels blessedly normal inside, and the customers and staff are mostly just everyday Koreans. Not a fancy place, but the food is fantastic. Although my favorite dish is the dolseot bibimbap, you can opt to have a grill table to cook various cuts of meat to your liking, and they continue to bring banchan (side dishes) while you eat. Healthy, fresh food, especially the cabbage, cucumber and radish kimchis. Considering the surrounding options, the meals here are a bargain. I have always had courteous and kind service here and I have never been disappointed with my food. Kamsahamnida!",

All that said, you just can't beat this place for selection, freshness, and side dishes all at a very decent price.  It all comes together so perfectly and the fact that it's mostly koreans on tour busses that come here -- solidifies the ambiance.  Reminds me of korea.  reminds me of childhood.    Is it the best quality? no.  Is it the most selection? No. is it korea? no.  BUT!!!! its a great mix of all the above that blends so well for the very very reasonable price.

You also have to pay $5 for to park in the nearby lot (or, if you're not pressed for time, you can always go on a mission and park at the closest casino's parking for free and then walk over.) But, when it became time to dine, we were pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the banchan and the meat. The majority of the food offered for their AYCE was above average and extremely satisfying.   They have the table-side-door-bell so we would press it whenever we needed service, it's very convenient! Also, the ladies working here will try to cook the meats for you, but if you don't want them to, just let them know you got it and they will leave you alone.   Here's the banchan (sides) we got: - Stir-fried little fish guys  - Pickled steamed broccoli - *Kkakdugi (pickled radish cubes) - *Kimchi - *Kongnamul-muchim (seasoned korean soybean sprouts)  - *Mountain of lettuce (seasoned with a Korean tangy sweet soy dressing)  *everything with a star in front, I enjoyed very much and went for seconds/ thirds. I recommend grilling your kimchi and radish cubes! It awakens the seasonings and makes them even more delicious.  Here's what we selected from the AYCE menu: (it comes with white rice) - Bulgogi (thinly sliced marinaded beef) Very tender beef, moist and flavorful. We enjoyed it! Flavor rating: 4/5 - Chadolbaegi (brisket point without marinade) This was my least favorite cut of meat -  It was very chewy, tough and dry. The natural flavor of the meat was enjoyable. Flavor rating: 3/5 - Samgyeopsal (pork belly) This was excellent! The pork belly was super buttery after it was cooked and melted in my mouth!  Try not to overcook it. If you're unsure, ask the ladies working, they'll take care of you. Definitely dip the cooked pork belly into the sesame oil with seasoning and enter food ecstasy! Flavor rating: 5/5 - LA Galbi (beef short-rib with house marinade) **LIMIT: 1 PERSON 2 PIECES ONLY** - This was one of our favorites! It was tender, meaty, moist, and flavorful. We somehow didn't catch the small red writing that said 2 pieces only per person, so we were disappointed when we found out we couldn't order anymore for AYCE. Flavor rating 5/5  $23.95 is one of the better (tastier) deals for Korean BBQ AYCE in the area, so we are fans!  Pro tip: after you've ingested pounds of glorious meat, take a walk on the strip to help with digestion and enjoy people (tourist) watching! :p",

We were originally going to eat the Japanese Ramen place across the street of the strip but they're closed on Monday & Tuesday so we had no choice but to eat elsewhere. This place is located a little bit off the strip...kind of a hole in the wall type of restaurant but it wasn't too shabby.  We didn't go for the Korean BBQ buffet because it was too pricey $30/person & apparently you can only eat for 1 hour + no to-go. Not worth it so we ordered regular entrees instead. The food was flavorful and True to Korean dishes along with their side dishes and tofu soup. The shrimp dumpling appetizers were chewy and delicious! We got more than we can chew so we ended up taking it to-go but overall it was nicely cooked. Service was ok, the only thing was the majorly disappointing was their CANNED lemon iced tea (Brisk) lol here I thought it would be actual sweet iced tea until they just brought out the can -_- fail...",

My friend and I didn't have too much have an appetite so I didn't do the AYCE but the rest of our group which was an additional 4 people did. They told us either we ALL have to do AYCE or we can't which was stupid. So my friend and I who wasn't opting for the AYCE sat at a different table next to them. It was so stupid.  I had tofu soup because I was hungover and I thought it was okay. Not that great, but what can I really expect for something being on the strip? My friends who had the AYCE said it was pretty good.  Service was HORRIBLE for my table. Not once did the waitress check on our table or refilled our water. She visited our groups table frequently but not ours. Maybe because we didn't get AYCE we weren't as valuable customers as those who did.  Anyway, usually tip is included if you're a party of 5/6 or more right? Well they added the tip on there because we were originally a group of 6 I guess but we had to separate so it was NOT right of them to add the tip on there already since we ended up being 2 different parties and the fact that she never visited our table for any service at all!",

I know typically when they help cook for you or so a lot more work with kbbq or if you do a buffet they automatically tip themselves but this is ridiculous. Sad thing is this lady lost out on more tip because we would have tipped more if she didn't do it herself. Only a few plates of side dishes. Not really remarkable.",

    "text": "Walked along the strip on my first night in Vegas and started salivating when I saw \"All You Can Eat Korean BBQ Buffet\" for $30 per person. ... with restrictions. You need at least a party of two, you have a one hour to eat, their the galbi is limited to two pieces per person, and you have to pay for extra uneaten food.  First time we went, we didn't try the BBQ. The 6 side dishes were so tasty. Picked radish, picked zucchini, beansprout, kimchi, marinated beef, and seaweed. We tried the bibimbap and mandu guk. The bibimbap was very delicious (the rice was toasted perfectly!) with the exception of the eggplant that was a bit hard and plain. The mandu guk's broth was flavorful, the glass noodles' texture was on the spot, but the dumplings were more on the plain side (very lightly seasoned).   Second time I went alone and wanted to try the BBQ buffet but the lady said it was only available to two persons and more. I was disappointed and left. I'll try it next time for sure when I come back to Vegas.  For an Asian restaurant on the Strip, this exceeded my expectations. Want to grab something Asian that's not too terribly expensive for its location? You won't be too disappointed at this restaurant, especially if you like Korean food.",

Ginseng is pretty hard to find, but if you go to the alley behind fatburger it's right before the start of the parking lot on the right.  I went in to get their all you can eat Korean BBQ and was a little skeptical because of the 3 star rating on here.  But as soon as you try some of their side dishes, you'll know this place is the real deal.  All the banchan (side dishes) were fresh and well-made.  Definitely get refills of their salad too, because that really makes the meal.  It was perfectly sauced where it was not too salty and not too sweet.  All the meats were pretty solid, but this place may have the best bulgogi I've ever had.  Amazingly done.  The 2 negatives about this place was that the galbi was limited to 2 slabs per person and that the all you can eat does not come with the egg dish, nor the jigae.  Solid spot for 3.5 star AYCE Korean BBQ.",

And I always get their dolsat bibimbap, the vegetables with raw beef and egg in a sizzling stone pot. Yummy. Forgot to check in here so I'll leave a review instead.",

    "text": "Surprisingly good Korean food in Las Vegas. Don't get me wrong, this won't give any LA spots a run for their money but they do alright here.  The kalbi marinade is pretty good. Every time I come here the people I bring are surprised that it's pretty decent. None of my friends ever walk in here with any expectations what so ever.   If you're gonna eat meat here get ready to bend over and take it in the wallet. They nickel and dime you like you would not believe. The inn keeper from Les Misrables? Yes, he is alive and kicking and has taken the form of Korean restauranteur. Pay for lettuce, kimchee, soup, garlic, peppers, and 10% for looking the mirror twice.  The kicker is the chick-nengmyun. This is cold, black, buckwheat noodle in a sweet and slightly spicy cold broth that is not all that common and oh so delicious.   This place is open 24 hours so you'll find many a drunk Korean young man here around 3 or 4 am... not that I know anything about that...",

    "text": "After eating our fair share of buffets and over priced Vegas food, the babe and I decided to curb our craving for Asian food and go to Ginseng Korean BBQ.  The babe had been here before so it wasn't a blind adventure.  Plus lady luck was not on our side at Caesar's so it was a good chance to escape the temptation to contribute even more to the local economy.  The place is located in the back of a shopping center on the strip across from Monte Carlo.  The place is decorated in typical Korean BBQ style.  We wasted no time and placed our order for mandu and two orders of kalbi.  The panchan was average but the mandu was great!  Not too much kimchi inside and the right blend of ingredients....yum!  We probably could have done with one order of kalbi but nevertheless the meat was tasty, marbled, and marinated pretty well.    Overall, a decent place and a surprise find in Vegas.  It's not as good as K-town in LA but it's a good place to go if you are craving some Korean food.  Service was great and we left the place with our appetites satisfied and only $70 less in our pockets...which is probably equivalent to the babe's one round of blackjack...",

    "text": "A total find in a sketchy side street off the Las Vegas Strip.  We passed by a huge marquee advertising Ginseng Korean BBQ in both English and Korean several times. We couldn't believe there could be a good Korean restaurant there. But after hearing good things from a friend, and unable to ignore our intense cravings for spicy Korean soup, we decided to give it a shot.  Ginseng Korean BBQ is located past the Fatburger on a small street off the Strip. As soon as I entered, I felt like this was going to be the real deal. Everyone in the restaurant was Korean, as were all of the servers and the manager.    We were seated and given menus. Yes, the prices are more expensive than the average Korean restaurant. But this is the Vegas Strip, what do you expect?  I ordered the yukae jang (spicy beef and vegetable soup), my fiance got his usual soondubu (soft tofu stew extra extra spicy), and we ordered an appetizer of jap chae (sweet potato flour cellophane noodles stir-fried with beef and vegetables). The jap chae was hot and flavorful and totally hit the spot. The side dishes that came out were authentic, fresh, and delicious. The kimchee was very good.  I had a bite of soondubu and it was so good. My yukae jang was excellent - piping hot, spicy, and perfectly seasoned with plenty of shredded beef, a little egg, vegetables, and cellophane noodles. I was in heaven.  It was a refreshing change to have quality Korean food after eating so many rich Western meals. This place is great.",

What we ordered: Dolsot Bibimbop Naengmyun Kalbi Tang Dok Mandu Guk Ojingo Bokum  Service was a-ok. Not great, but not bad. The food was ok. Not great (or even exceptionally good), but not bad. Everything was just ok.   Expect to pay more because you are in Vegas. But price didn't hurt the rating.   It's just that there was nothing that great about the food, and there are other choices to try.",
