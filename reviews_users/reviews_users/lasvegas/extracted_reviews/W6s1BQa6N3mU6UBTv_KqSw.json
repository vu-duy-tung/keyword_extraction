I had the classic burger and it was delightful. The skinnyfats spread they put on the burger is to die for. It's different from any other spread I've had on a burger at any other place. The fries were a little soggy by the time I got back home but we're still really good. I'm sure the fries are not like that when they first come out as they were inside a box that got pretty steamy. I definitely recommend this joint. I can't wait to try some of there other items they have on the menu.",

We received out food very quickly and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The Cherry Popper Burger was outstanding and the truffle fries are addicting.   One of the very best burgers in town. All the staff were friendly and happy and we never felt rushed, even though we were the last ones there.  This was my third time there and the food just keeps getting better and better.

One of the employees (I believe a shift manager) saw that we turned around, she opened the door and told us to come on in.  We told her we didn't want to be \"those people\" and she told us to not worry about it and that they were happy to have us in.  She was beyond friendly and had such good energy around her.   A different employee took our order and rang us up.  She was super sweet and had a good energy.  She took the time go to over the beer menu with us and she seemed happy even though we came in at close.    The food was great too but the customer service is what made me review this place!  Hands down one of the best experiences I've had since moving to Vegas 10 years ago.",

    "text": "I read a review that said a take out order took forever and the food was then less than appetizing ... I should have listened to that one.   I ordered the buffalo cauliflower which was really good and spicy, but with just a handful of florets, not worth the price.   The zucchini noodles were bland. I had to add a lot of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to give it flavor.   When I went to pick up my food, it sat and sat forever and  there was no order or structure for pick up orders. By the time I got home, both the cauliflower and zucchini leached a ton of water and it just wasn't pleasant to eat. For $15 (which isn't a huge bill), I was pretty unsatisfied.   UPDATE: I tried this restaurant again hoping I would have a better experience. The main issue is the lack of organization with pick up orders. After waiting in line behind people ordering, I got to the register where I was informed pick up orders should be picked up at the bar. A sign at the bar stating \"pick up orders here\" would be helpful.   I ordered buffalo cauliflower again, but this time they forgot to add the yogurt sauce that comes with it. Again it was small, so this must just be the normal size.   I added chicken to the zucchini and it was pretty good. The naked chicken with balsamic, capers, and arugula was really good, and the caper dressing was great.   The side of cauliflower was pretty paltry. I was shocked to open it and find the container not even half full. I would say maybe a quarter cup. It was very strong on the garlic and I didn't really enjoy it.   Second time with take out and just okay. Maybe dining in would be a better experience?",

Next time I'll order the dressing on the side.   This is a second review, ( 9/8/17) I ordered through Postmates to get delivery. I have ordered the stuff on curry bowl in the past and really enjoyed it. This time however, it was terrible. It was completely bland yet overwhelmingly spicy at the same time, the noodles were undercooked , dried out, and had zero flavor, almost as if they didn't season it whatsoever. There were also about a pound of jalapenos in it, both raw and cooked and it was so overly spicy it was inedible. I'm extremely disappointed because I know the potential of this place but sad to say I probably won't order from here again.   Review number 3! After my bad experience last time and my prior review I'm happy to report that SkinnyFats reached out to me to make up for the bad meal. We were able to go back in and give another chance and I'm glad we did. The meal was fantastic and we'll certainly be back!",

I digress...  They do have Healthy and Happy Juices & Shakes like the Delicious Cucumber that are made on their Cold Press Side of the Eatery. I do believe they have Cucumber Water as well, but just ask them. ;)  The Tu-Nuts that I spoke of earlier consisted of Fresh Ahi Meat & Spicy Slaw, Sitting in a Cucumber Boat, sprinkled with Almonds, Teriyaki Sauce, Avocado Slices and, Sriracha Aioli, it was on their Shareable Menu, but I could easily eat all of the delicious goodness myself!   The Delicious Cucumber Shake that I had consisted of Juiced Cucumbers, Strawberries & Lemons, with your choice of Ice Cream or Froyo, 2% Milk, or Soy Milk.

They also have a patio that will be open in cooler months.   No call ahead ordering yet so I walked in and waited in line to get my food to go. It wasn't terribly busy so I was glad to see the lines have gone down a little since opening.   I ordered a Tu-Nuts, a nice to greek you and a side of frickles!   The tu-nuts was a large Cucumber shell topped with tons of ahi tuna, a little slaw, fresh avocado and spicy aioli! Delicious and fresh it's easily shareable but I indulged in this baby all myself.   The nice to Greek you was a crispy flatbread with feta cheese, chopped Cucumber and tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, big slices of grilled chicken and a sweet balsamic glaze!   Frickles were crispy pickle chips with a little Cajun seasoning spice and the chipotle aioli served up with them was the perfect side kick.   The cashier was helpful and efficient, the staff was friendly and my food was done quickly and correctly.   I'm looking forward to frequenting this place for my healthy and guilty pleasure eats!",

    "text": "UPDATE 2/3/17: In the interest of full disclosure, we were comp'd $40 towards this meal after our previous 2 less than stellar experiences.  I'm super happy to report that we tremendously enjoyed most of our food tonight, all from the Happy Side and all with tasty animals featured.  As a lady in line behind us remarked to other patrons, \"I only ever order from the Happy Side because you can't go wrong!\"  I couldn't agree more!  Hubby had the Cherry Popper with sweet potato fries and I had the Sweet Cheese Us with sweet potato fries.  We also had the Tu-Nuts to share.  First of all, if nothing else, I would come back every day just for those fries.  They are literally perfection and tonight was somehow even more crack-iliciously good than normal!  The Cherry Popper was absolutely scrumptious, at least from the tiny piece I was able to finagle off of Hubby.   I'm actually sad that I didn't go with my original intention of ordering this myself.  The Tu-Nuts was also divine!  Beware, this is sinfully rich, but oh so worth it!  Hubby would've liked to have a little more heat to balance all the sweet richness, but I thought it was great as is.  Interestingly, this may be the only dish on the entire menu that lists spicy ingredients but is actually LESS spicy than expected!  Our only slight disappointment, bringing this down to 4 stars from an otherwise perfect 5 stars, was the Sweet Cheese Us, specifically the very thin and grainy cheddar sauce.  The meat itself was tender and juicy, if a tad under seasoned, but the sauce left a very odd texture and taste in our mouths.  If I ordered this again, I would skip the sauce and just keep the pepper jack cheese it also comes with.  I was also happy to see that the names of some new items had been changed since our last visit to avoid any future confusion with same-name items at their other locations.  Great job, SkinnyFATS, on both service recovery and living up to your delicious reputation this time!",

The \"healthy\" side is for people tying to watch their weight and the \"happy\" side is for more flavorful, higher calorie foods. The decor here is really nice. There is a nice outdoor seating area perfect for anytime except summer, and the inside sitting area is very trendy. My personal opinion, I like this restaurant but I'm not blown away by it. Everything I had on the healthy side is mediocre at best (I was a vegan for 2 months and came here often because I work close by). In their defense, healthy food doesn't always taste the best. The happy side of the menu does taste good but I feel is too pricey for what it is. I enjoy the water dispenser because they add cucumber slices in the water which adds a refreshing taste to it. I'll probably come here occasionally because I work close by. I enjoy this place, the service is really good and the atmosphere is fun, but I can't see myself eating here more than once every other month.",

The take out orders are placed in a box and shut closed with a SkinnyFats sticker which made the box sweat. My boyfriends sandwich was soggy, his fries were even more soggy than the sandwich that he couldn't even eat them & the inside of the boxes were dripping wet. My burger was a little better but still couldn't eat the whole thing. I was so disappointed bc I really wanted to like this place but  seriously don't order take out from here......",

Both times the wait to order is a bit on the long side, but finding a seat and time until you get your food is very very quick! So I'll just be patient.   Their sodas are amazing. Birch beer, yes, please.   My family has some pretty significant food allergies, so eating out is difficult, especially when things are not all made in house, from scratch. But this place was able to accommodate all of our crazy allergies, no epipen or Benadryl required. That is huge! What that means for you, (if you don't have allergies) is that you're not eating crap. You're getting real food. Like REAL, food.   So far we have eaten wakey happy(scrambled eggs, bacon and toast), mini moo(kids burger, and fries), skinny cluck (? Kids seared chicken, fruit, and honey mustard) nice to Greek you, (flat bread, grilled chicken, onions, tomatoes, balsamic dressing and Greek sauce who's name I am blanking), smoke in a bowl (BBQ grilled chicken, cauliflower rice, sauteed onions and peppers, cilantro yo and my husband got it with mango salsa instead of beans, Phenomenal, will be ordering again, and again) and buff chick (buffalo chicken, and truffle fries, PERFECTION.)  All were amazing! Kids meals are reasonably priced especially given the amount of food.   We will be returning. Often.",

I had to use a napkin to remove some of the salt, finally asking a server if the could make more fries with less salt. The fruit salad has been around for a while. I can only assume from the appearance is that this comes from a package and not prepared fresh daily. Sorry, I really used to be in love with this place...Things are changing.",

My husband convinced me to have lunch here today, and I admit to protesting just a little but gave in.  Katie was our cashier today, she was awesome! Very personable and understanding when it came to doing a bit of customizing on my order to avoid dairy and wheat. Easy peasy with the Tu-Nuts. We also ordered a Green Mile cold pressed juice to share- delicious. And I'm glad we shared between the two of us because it's a pretty big cup. My husband ordered a Chix on Broadway, but by mistake received a Chickhumm. No biggie, he still ate it anyway and finished it up, with a generous side of truffle fries. We also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. I'm a bit of a sweet potato fry critic (much like T is a fry a hot dog critic) and one issue I have consistently noticed is that places can't get them crispy. I am thankful to report that this is not the case here today. We received a huge plate of them and they were SO good. Paired with their CHILLpotle ketchup... YUM.  Every member of their staff that we interacted with today was awesome. I have to give a shout out to the gal who brought out our food and also brought me a side of sriracha (thanks!) and also the one that found my phone, what a fail that would have been.  All in all, I'm happy that they have finally lived up to their hype. We'll definitely be back. OH, and if you can, snag a spot out on their patio- super chill.",

This was my favorite dish from here and I was craving it so you can imagine my disappointment.  I usually go into a location and it comes out hot and moist, but I am under the weather and wanted to give this Postmates thing a try. Epic fail",

(By the way, she's had the Berry Strong protein waffle and loved it.)  The register cashier was so helpful with his suggestions.  He explained what was on the menu and gave a few ideas for us.    We both ended up ordering one of his choices off the Healthy side menu. I had the Bleu Balsamic.  The portion size was nice, the steak was abundant, and the ingredients were fresh!  Next time, I'd ask for the balsamic on the side, because the vinegar was a bit too overpowering.  Mom had the Avocatoast.  She loved it and finished every bite.  I loved that both meals were under 550 calories and quite filling.  They also have Happy Side meals, which aren't so low in calories and would make anyone comforted!  And included in their menu are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.  Parking is close, free and plentiful.  They are in a major strip center, so don't panic if you don't see them from the street.  Just drive along the side and you'll find them.  It's worth it!",

The menu is so fun; on one side there are healthy options (under 600 calories per meal) and on the other side the no so healthy options. They also have a juicery attached to the restaurant.   I opted for the buff chix which was Buffalo chicken fingers with truffle fries and cucumber infused water they offered in the refreshment stand. The chicken was moist and the fries were so yummy! The portions were decent, more than enough food for me.   The atmosphere is very hipster but relaxed. They chose a good location next to a fit boot camp and massage envy.

I used some of their very own spicy ketchup to add some kick to the burger. I chose the cauliflower rice as my side. This was a bit on the bland side but still a nice addition to the burger. I would definitely order the burger again. On my second visit I had the blueberry yum yum French toast. This was very good and the berries were the perfect compliment. This really curbed my craving for French toast. Coffee is free before 11am.  The employees here are super friendly and helpful. They greet you as you walk in and thank you as you leave.

They got everything right from the music, the ambience, the vibe, the friendly staff, the cute salt and pepper shaker, the big smiley on the wall and of course the food.  Glad we chose to come here for our date day.   Hubby ordered a caulifire and a slow boat to China. I had Tu-Nuts and a spicy Latina. We were \"supposed\" to share. He did, I didn't.  The caulifire was good, a little vinegary but light. Both the slow boat to China and Tu-Nuts were pretty filling yet refreshingly good. I preferred the Tu-Nuts just because I'm a poke freak. The spicy Latina was muy Caliente! It was cheesy, creamy, spicy yet light. Everything was good.   We walked out of there feeling satisfied. So glad they're in my side of town. We will definitely be back. I already know what I'm ordering next :)  Oh and by the way, they also provide military discount.",

Good on the go or dine in, it's a good place for some fast eats prepared in a speedy Gonzalez manner.   Ambiance here is laid back and nice. They have booths and some communal bar seating. They also have a decent amount of hipster art, feeling modern while at the same time a little bit of rustic.  Service here is top notch, the cashier took our order and even recommended some of her personal favorites. She even had a little personality. Something you don't normally see in a cut and dry town. We also got our food within 7-10 mins which was great cause we just killed the gym a few minutes prior and we needed to feed the beast.   Food wise this place has everything the young and hip want to see. They got truffle starches, your Brussels and seafood. We ended up getting a little bit more of the fat than skinny. We opted for the turkey meatballs with a rich marinara! Now that's a dense meatball with a nice herbaceous kick. We got the turnip taco part of the skinny menu. The meat was fillet and boy was it cooked to perfection. It was soft with a slight chew but tears away clean. The turnip was crunchy and it tasted clean and light. We also got the shrimp tempura taco (fat menu) the shrimps were plump and moist with a nice little bite. Best part of these scrimps are their size. You get some real value biting into these tacos. Lastly we got the shrimp tempura appetizer. It was a great mix of light and heavy. The shrimps were plump the cream aioli smooth,  the pico was tart and citrusy. It's a literal mix of  skinny and fat. They also have a huge collection of ketchups for every occasion from sweet to spicy. You'll want to ketchup with these bad boys.   Overall this place is fun, tasty and clean. You'll like the modern decor, enjoy the sauces/arrangements and enjoy your time while doing it. Try something clean and enjoy a little grease. Don't forget to take some pics, the food comes out ready for a photo op. Don't be a shrimp here, you don't want to be shellfish!!! ;)",

I've been amazed, they've even tempted him to healthier options.. stuff I never thought I'd see him eat!  Got the greek flatbread the other night, it was great. Only demerit was the balsamic vinegar on it. While I love balsamic, really really love balsamic, it was out of place and overpowered the other flavors. I'll order it again but ask for less balsamic and more tsatsiki sauce.  We've had quite a few different meals already, and we haven't been disappointed yet.",

I needed more sauce and a definite sprinkling of some fresh herbs (menu said I got basil, but I couldn't find it) and some veggies. The flavor was good, but just chintzy. I saw people's towering loaded salads coming out. The people beside us had chicken & waffles with fries. Plates were overflowing. My other half had the tacos that touted 220 calories. We weren't sure if that was for the plate of two or each. She swore they were tasty. Finally, we had the cauliflower bites. They were \"OK\" just too raw and sour. I'll come back mind you, but for sure I'll have the towering salad or waffles if my diet worked. OR---- Maybe I'll just have a broccoli side with extra fresh basil and try my curry plate again!",

My fav is their Tomato Soup (the best I've ever had) and their grilled cheese combo! Or the Swinetology with Turkey Bacon substitute. Also, they are a few of some places who offer Garlic Truffled Fries!!!  10/10 recommend!",

The service here from EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE was amazing, and come to think of it, it always is My boo is a very picky and difficult customer when it comes to her food but they got all of the requests spot on. I got the Happy Mess from the secret menu. Luckily I saw it. I've come to this location before and not ordered because I didn't think they had it.. Oh well. It was as great as I remember it being.   They really have so many great things! I love their selection of fountain drinks. You can tell they're made better. I have a weakness for Root Beer/Cream soda (here has probably the best I've ever had), and they even had a Birch Beer which was really tasty too. Employees there suggested I mix a couple of them together, and it didn't disappoint. Also, grab all of the Caramel Sea Salt cookies they have. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Out of curiosity I tried the ZUCC IT. As the menu states the first ingredient is \"zucchini noodles.\" It had me visioning spiral cut zucchini noodles with a tasty sauce and vegetables.  Spiralizing, I've seen this trend in restaurants and food magazines.  When my dish arrived what was in front of me was not what I had imagined at all. I suppose as a culinarian, I read too deep into the description of the menu.  The zucchini noodles because they were shredded thinner than angel hair pasta, once cooked, became soggy strands in the sauce. The ratio of zucchini noodles, which is the highlight of this dish considering they named the dish ZUCC IT, was not the highlight at all. There was way too much sauce for the amount of vegetables and very little zucchini. The result of this dish was an unappealing texture of web like strands of zucchini tangled in cuts of vegetables drowning in arrabbiata sauce. Can you envision it?  Calling them \"zucchini noodles\" may make the dish sound hip and trendy. However, it only lent to the failure of this dish.  Just cut up the zucchini and leave the word noodle out.  What I ordered was a bowl of vegetables stewed in arrabbiata sauce.  That is what your menu description should have read.  I would have ordered that with no further expectations.  I have eaten at other locations and enjoyed it.  I'll still return here since its closer to me but won't be ordering ZUCC IT.",

I was honestly turned off by the name \"Skinny Fats\" because it sounded like it might be a \"Heart Attack Grill\" kind of place, but it's completely different, and I'll explain what I love about it.   *I love how friendly the hostess is, Mariana I think was her name.   *I love that they have a \"Healthy/Low Calorie\" menu AND a \"Fatty\"-- but still fairly healthy menu as well.   *I love the fact that they have very good coffee, in real mugs, with free refills, and the mugs, as strange as this may sound, are really enjoyable to drink from. Specifically the top of the mug just fits your mouth better. Again-- I know that probably sounds really strange, but I think you'll know what I mean when you try them.   *I love the food!! I had the breakfast sandwich (I forget what it was called) and it was delicious and just $8.95. It also came with a side order of your choice. I chose the sweet potato fries (mainly because they are healthier) but my friend got the house potatoes and the house potatoes were delicious!   *I even liked the fact that the men's room had a unique hand dryer different than any I have seen before.   *The seating is very comfortable as well (large booths with comfortable backing).  *I could go on with things that I like and or love about this place, but I will leave it at the fact that the prices are very affordable for the quality of food and the experience you have.    This is an easy 5 star review and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We finally got around to trying SkinnyFATS tonight. I was a big fan, but my husband is a little more picky and wasn't quite as pleased as I was. He didn't like the cucumber water, and I agree that the flavor was a little strong. I had the Naked Chix and my husband had I believe the Wake N Bacon (breakfast sandwich). I thought my meal was awesome; my husband's only gripe about the sandwich was that it had onions and the avocados were sliding off. He said the breakfast potatoes didn't have much flavor. The girl who served us (didn't catch her name, unfortunately) was super kind and explained the whole menu and concept of the restaurant to us. I definitely plan to go back and try some of the \"happy\" menu items as well as some of their juices and cookies. We only got checked on once during our meal, but because the drinks are self service and you pay when you order, that's to be expected.  I would recommend checking out the menu before you go to get an idea of what you want; I felt like I was rushing my husband because another couple had come in behind us and I didn't want a line to build up. I thought the atmosphere and decor were super cute. I get sick of all the chain restaurants here in Vegas, so SkinnyFATS is definitely a welcome addition to our 'hood. I'm just sorry I waited so long to give them a try!",

She never said her name I wish she did. She was a vegetarian like me so pointed out a lot of great items on the menu. I took her suggestion to get the black bean burger with truffle fries. They even had vegan parmesan cheese. KEY TO MY HEART.  I had the buffalo cauliflower too. I love when people make that because it tastes just like wings, just no meat :)  I did however get this organic apple \"cider\" thing. Idk if it was old or flat, but it tasted flat with no carbonation. I spent $12 on it :( it was more than my whole meal lol. Sucks when that was the worst part of the meal. I didn't tell them I didn't like it because they were so sweet so I ate the $12.  at the end they walked around handing out samples of peanut butter cookies! Nom nom.",

Of course my boyfriend and I chose from the happy options. I ordered from the secret menu which are the small TVs against the wall in line. I forget the name but I went with a fried chicken sandwich and fries and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles.   The staff was absolutely amazing! Extremely kind and helpful and genuinely looked happy to be there, which is rare customer service to find nowadays.   Our food was amazing and exceeded out expectations. For the first time ever my sandwich looked exactly like the photos advertised. I was truly impressed. It had a lot of flavor and the spice was just right. There was fried pickles and coleslaw inside as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and waffles. The waffles were delicious!   I'm glad I came here and next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back!",

It is Bacon, Egg Frittata, Pepper Jack Cheese, Avocado, Sriracha Cream Cheese on a Hawaiian Roll, and comes with Country Potatoes.  The sandwich was delicious, lots of applewood smoked bacon cooked nice and crispy. I was a little worried about the Sriracha Cream Cheese, but it was a great flavor combination when put together with the other ingredients.  The potatoes were a bit dry, but I added some of their 'Pepper Catchup' that was on the table and it helped them out a lot. They have quite an extensive menu for both \"healthy\" and \"happy\" eating. I will definitely be back to try some lunch options.",

Once you walk in, you order at the front and they give you a number to set on the table, then you go find a seat. They bring the food for you.  It's unique how they have a healthy side & happy side. They give you the calories for the healthy side and I wish they would give you the calories for the happy side too.  We ordered the cheesesteak 'Sweet Cheese Us' with Truffle fries, Teriyahi sandwich, and Pimp Shrimp and Caulifire from appetizers.  The food came out pretty quickly, about 10 min or so. The cheesesteak sandwich was cheesy and had a generous amount of meat. I loved the bread and the cheese sauce they put on top.   Teriyahi Sandwich and the appetizers were delicious.  We will be back!!",

With a decent amount of beers to boost the culinary creativity here really is something that elevates typical Americana to something a bit more satisfying.   The burgers are an easy win if you want something both filling and delectable. On this visit had mine with a side of sweet potato fries and a beer. Also ordered pickle chips to start with. They came out quick and fried to perfection. Another bonus is the cookies . Make sure to grab one if your wanting to splurge and add on a few extra calories. They have several locations in and around town. The other good thing is they are family friendly so bring the little ones and enjoy a meal out of the house.",

    "text": "SkinnyFATS is one of my favorite places to get my grub on after working out. I can be in my gym clothes and still get treated with dignity. How dramatic! But seriously, not only is their food good but the service is the best in town. This might even be the first review I write starting with the service first and food second.  As soon as you make your way to the order counter, there's always a big bright smile waiting for you. And I remember when they first opened, we were guinea pigs for menu items they were testing out and they were very receptive to feedback. My friends and family have been coming here every week after the gym since then...sometimes, even more that some employees already know what I'm about to order. I appreciate people who remember little things - it shows that they pay attention and care enough. That or I'm just very predictable.  Moving on to their food...they have a \"skinny\" side and a \"happy\" side on the menu. \"Skinny\" would be the healthier options, and \"happy\" includes fried, rich, or sweet options. I've tried items from both sides and I haven't had anything I didn't like. A list of what I normally get:  Zucc It (spiralized zucchini with steak, eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms and arrabiatta sauce) Cluck Moo  Too Nuts Caulifire (cauliflower Buffalo style) Truffle Fries Balls 2.0 (think arancini) Buff Chix (buffalo chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries) Slow Boat to China Smoke in a Bowl Naked Chix More Cow Bowl Charlie Brownie (Nutella, strawberry, banana, froyo, almond milk shake) Cinnutella (cinnamon-sugar French toast with spiced Nutella and orange syrup)  It gets real busy around 12-1pm and 6-7:30pm. We try to come here at odd times to avoid the crowd.",

I love that the menu is split down the middle for healthy options and fat options.  I love that I can order a beer or a fruit a smoothie.  The Nutella shakes are amazing.  The buff chicks (buffalo tenders) are among the best in the city, maybe the best.  The truffle fries are a great side for the tenders, and the sauces are to die for.  Skinny fats offers peppercorn, jalapeno, and pineapple ketchup; all of which are extraordinary.  In fact, I even buy them by the bottle and use them at home.    All this talking about skinny fats, and I want it more than ever.  I really hope they're open right now..",

    "text": "Praise the food gods for this restaurant. It's about time this side of town gets a solid place to grab some good grub. This is *the* spot to go if you're craving something either healthy or fatty to eat that's not a fast food joint or Chili's. The menu is similar to the SkinnyFATS locations across town, but I prefer this one over the others. Food here is consistent, and the service is fantastic.   The Teriyahi sandwich s a must. It's hard to believe it's on the \"healthy\" side of the menu at just a little over 400 calories (if you're counting). The sandwich is hearty and flavorful and bomb over all. Seared ahi tuna slices with citrus slaw, spinach, and tomatoes sandwiched together, what's not to love about that?  The Vegwich sandwich is also a perfect pick for a meal, and you won't miss the meat. A Portobello cap, avocado, horseradish, and pepper marmalade comprise this sandwich. This is full of flavor and the peppers add some serious heat.   Sometimes, pasta can just suck it (sorry, pasta, I still love you). For a lighter fare, the Zucc.It bowl is the perfect mix of all things good for you. Zucchini noodles, eggplant, squash, peppers, and mushrooms...yum! There's also an option to add a protein of your choice. Shrimp is a good option, IMO.   Juices and chocolate chip cookies are awesome. Give those a try, too.   There's hardly ever a short line here, which is why I take my orders to go. Ordering online through their website or their app is the way to do it.   Overall: The best spot in the area to grab a bite to eat. There's something for everyone on the menu.",

My roommate brought home some delicious fried pickles the other night and I had to know where he got them. Sure enough, it was SkinnyFats. I was planning to make a trip over, but Bubs suprised me with a smorgasbord of items for dinner. We had fried pickles, a shrimp taco, a mahi taco, poke with cucumber, a sourdough burger with a side of truffle fries, and a mango shake. All of that was around $50. Decent portions but it did lean towards the pricey side. Sorry for the lack of pics. It all looked so good I couldn't hold back! The poke was served with avocado slices on a hollowed out cucumber. It completely fell apart, but the flavor profile was still good. Original way to serve poke. Nice and fresh. The only items that fell a little short were the truffle fries and the mahi taco. The taco had good sauce, but the fish was a tad on the dry side. The truffle fries were shoe string skinny. I may be biased but I prefer thick cut. Overall everything tasted good so I will most definitely come back again!",

Decor and staff are both great for good vibes.   The downfall? It's hard to be decisive about what to order (as exhibited by myself and other people lingering the back without actually deciding yet), and people have a million questions when they get to the counter. It can take a long time to order your food.   If you're like me and love savory AND sweet for breakfast (the ultimate indulgence), have one person order the churro waffles with Nutella and share food! (While this is a meal of pure sugar and fat, oh my goddddd you need at least one of those crispy waffles if you're gonna come here!)",

I knew they had some choices at the main store so I waited in line for a bit to try the Fruit Punch smoothie and a chocolate chip cookie. The smoothie was 1 star while the cookie brought up the rate to 3. The smoothie was larger in size but was about $6...the taste was 90% lemon. It stated it has apples strawberries banana agave lemon blended but it was like a strawberry lemon icey slush. For that much I could've gotten a hug smoothie at Jamba Juice that tastes like the actual ingredients. The cookie was fresh and had lots of chocolate had no complaints really. Just super disappointed in a restaurant that has their own ColdPress extension and couldn't make a tastier smoothie ?? Wont be making a special stop for something like that here anymore but will just stick to the food",

I ordered on the Happy side getting The Meltdown with a side of sweet potato fries and an order of Frickles (Fried Pickles) with a drink. The drink came in a plastic cup that you can wash & re-use? Not sure about bringing it back to the store and re-using though.   Overall price was $20 something dollars... pretty expensive in my opinion for a patty melt, sweet potato fries, drink, and fried pickles.   Flavors were great though with the sweet potato fries being the best I've had yet. Beating out The Habit and some other places that serve sweet potato fries as well. They had nice dipping sauces at the table for you to use like Chipotle Ketchup.  Frickles were nicely fried and seasoned with cajun. Tasted great with the aioli they served with it.  I'd come back if I ever craved for something like this, but for the price value nah.",

Fresh smoothies with great unique flavors and now they are gone. My favorite was the Delightful Cucumber and secondly the Ginger Cinnaps and my husband and kids loved the Charlie Brownie flavor. I've seriously considered contacting the owners to ask them to bring them back or give me their recipes for them to make at home.  The 3 star I gave is solely because they stopped serving the smoothies which was the thing that brought me in the most despite them being pricey smoothies, it was worth it to me.   But it you're tired of me complaining about that...I do enjoy the Buff Chix meal. Their fries are amazing. Wasn't a fan of the Zucc It. Cookies are also huge and delicious. Their sandwiches are amazing as well. Good large portions. They always have friendly staff and are willing to make substitutions for you in the meals. The atmosphere is clean, fun and enjoyable. I'll change my rating to 5 stars when they bring those smoothies back!",

The area in blue are the calorie counting healthy menu options.  The ones in yellow are selections for people who care about flavor alone regardless the amount of calories. The adjoining store front is their cold press juice selection.  Our choice was from the healthy menu and cold press juice side.    Prices for the food and fresh juices range between $4-13.   It's hard to say if I would frequent a place like this at home because I'm always at farmers markets gathering up goods to make this kind of food and do my own juicing. I liked seeing the calorie count next to the dishes in blue, it gave me an idea of calories I'm consuming when I make these  foods at home.  I usually go out if the food Im craving is too much trouble to make at home or I want to sample something to duplicate cooking at home.  Or if I just don't feel in the mood to clean my juicer.  Visiting the area, we found it to be an excellent find.  We will be back!  Loved the vibe.  As you enter, it's clean , organized and equipped with a well trained friendly staff.   You can tell they do get very busy by the amount of stanchions they set up to form organized lines.  They offer the entire menu throughout the day.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Whatever your in the mood to have, there are no rules.  Nice, flexibility in dining major points.  Hours are 9-9 daily.  Easy peasy to remember.  Ambience, 5 stars...the space was warm and inviting with reclaimed wood, decor is cool, rustic and comfortable.  Music selection was great.   A place you'd want to hang out for a length of time if your schedule allowed.  The bar appeared to appeal to folks who dined alone.  It was a cross between what appeared to look like a bar and a diner cafe.  No one sitting on it ordered alcohol.  But then again it was 9am.  But then again who knows in Vegas?!  The crowd the same, a cross between young laptop users and an older cozy diner crowd.  Interesting  I can see this being popular for diners who want to dine together in the same restaurant but want totally different kinds of foods.  We ordered Wrap supastar-$10 Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico, spinach all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla covered in Cajun cilantro avocado crema Healthy & tasty 3 1/2 stars  Chickpea & quinoa soup Vegetable soup Healthy & delish 3 stars  It was huge, we should have shared.  Delicious juices  Two cold press juices, made fresh to order Vitamin extraction on the spot  Sweet ginger-$8 Apples, beets, carrots, lemon & ginger  Loved it 4 stars  Hangover remedy-$8 Apples,  cucumbers, celery, carrots, spinach, beets and ginger  Just what the doctor ordered. 4 stars  Service is quick, after you make your selection, you are provided a number and in the time you select a spot to eat, get settled...everything is promptly delivered to your table.    If your in the neighborhood, I recommend you stop in, even it's for just their tasty cold press juice. You'll want to linger just because they make you feel welcome despite how busy it can get.  I would however recommend they open earlier than 9:00am for breakfast.",

With that said, this place has awesome food! Burgers, their zucchini dish, etc. is awesome. Prices aren't the cheapest, but it's still affordable.   Update: management contacted me about the service issue. Now, there is no issue! Good stuff Lana! 5 stars for you!",

So, the first time I went to enjoy some skinnyfats I wasn't all that impressed. From the cashier to the uncleanliness and food which lacked seasoning/quality. I had the cherry popper, eh..the pictures seem to be more mouth watering. Anyway, the second time around I went for breakfast and ordered something simple. Eggs, potatoes, sausage,has browns and my husband ordered the slither burrito. My advice if you come here and are looking for a burst of flavor,choose something that looks complicated! The smoothies were great. Cashier still didn't seem very inviting but she was respectful and so was staff. It was a bit more clean then the first time we came in. Would I recommend to anyone, no. Would I recommend to another friend or local,yes.",

    "text": "As someone else had said, I regret not coming here sooner! I've had a hanger to partake from both happy and healthy sides, and they both have incredible options. As I am working to eat a little cleaner, I'll share from the healthy side. Cluck Moo is probably one of my favorite any-time-of-the-day meals. I surprised myself by enjoying the Naked Chix, chicken with mango over cauliflower rice. Everything was surprisingly flavor-packed, and the cauliflower rice was not nearly the bland, lifeless dish I assumed it would be!   As for environment, the place is stunning - the atmosphere and decor are a mix of modern, eclectic, thrift, and just COOL. The bathrooms were clean and have the coolest dual faucet/air dryer I've ever seen. They stay fairly busy but get the food out fast. If there's a line to order, it can be tough to see/read the overhead menu; they planned ahead and provided a ton of menu pamphlets throughout the ordering line, and have visual screens displaying some food options as well.  All in all a great visit with great atmosphere and delicious food. I'll gladly go back!",

The staff greeted me immediately as I entered and even gave suggestions on what they liked from the menu while I was in line in decisive mode. The inside was kept clean and tidy. Huge seating area and even a bar-like area with multiple televisions.  It was my first visit and won't be my last.",

We were in the area and didn't research much in reviews since we were hungry. Made our order and grabbed a table. I got a coffee and wasn't sure if refills were available since it looked like it was only behind the counter and nobody was doing top offs. Not a big deal and I didn't go and ask since I had water too. My husband got the chicken and waffles. He said both were ok, nothing amazing. I got the avocado-tofu scramble sandwich. They don't mention in the description that they use curry or some strong seasoning in it. I really didn't like it. My stomach wasn't in great shape to begin with and I found it nauseating. I ate half because I had ordered it, but thank goodness it came with a side. The truffle fries were really good. And I realized after I left that the sandwich had dyed my fingers yellow. I would be willing to try this place again, but I will question their descriptions a lot more. They do have a nice assortment of healthy or happy options.",

I had the TATS with sweet potato fries and they were both good, but pricey for the quantity and quality. If I have to wait 45 minutes, I would honestly rather grab a quick burger from a fast food chain. I will probably be back, but will call ahead to order next time because no one likes to be hangry!",

Beyond the great tasting food, I've got to commend the great service as well. Noticed we were missing a couple of items from the order we placed and when we brought it to their attention, Jason made sure we promptly got the missing items himself and took care of us. Will definitely be back!!",

Delicious never the least!  Here's an update on my review as of 7pm on the 04/04/19, in the past I have received much better service! It seems as time has gone by, so has the customer service. After placing my order I tried to take a sit on a table but there was water all over it, as if it was just cleaned and  a whole lot of excessive water was left behind, I looked around and all the tables looked the same, I approached Daniela, a worker of this fine establishment that was a few feet away conversation with whom seem like a friend of hers and asked her if I could get a dry rag to clean the table, upon the inquiry she simply said \"ya\" and continue with her conversation, I would of cleaned the table myself but I had my newborn in the car seat on my hand and couldn't do it, after several stares and my young daughter tried to clean it, Daniela decided to show up and dry cleaned the table and just left. As of this time I'm quite disappointed with the way this employee represented skinny fats vibe.",

It was awkward staring at the menu while others waited behind us because we had no idea what to order. The girl who took our order was super friendly and very helpful she explained a lot to us. We waited about 10 minutes for our food then I waited another 10  for my sweet potato fries. The food was very tasty but a little pricey. However I realized afterwards the reason why everything was so pricey. They use eco friendly products from bio degradable paper straws & to-go containers and the bathroom was energy efficient complete with automated sinks. We came, we ate, we enjoyed but will probably never be back.",

At this location I have ordered on the \"Skinny\" side only and again it has been really good. At their other location I have ordered on the \"Fat\" side and was also very good. I removed one star because those cups look great and all, but how many people actually keep and re-use? Such waste with sooooo much plastic. Other than that, great food all around. Additionally, maybe SkinnyFats can start a program like if you bring back your clean and reusable cup your customers can get a small discount on their fountain drink purchase. Like when Starbucks gives discounts when you bring your own cup in. This may motivate diners to actually save these reusable cups for future use.  Either way, love the food!!!",

I keep meaning to take a picture of one but I get too excited and end up inhaling it.. by the time I remember I need one, my husband has eaten the other half... yes, it's that big!!

This group should be used as an example of how to offer excellent customer service.   I went with the weekend special that was both creative and delicious. It was a chile relleno benedict with pulled pork and a lime hollandaise sauce. The chile relleno had a crispy breading with plenty of cheese instead. The poached eggs were perfectly prepared and the lime hollandaise was delicious. I loved this special dish. My husband had Steak Eyes and he found it both delicious and filling.",

This is not acceptable. My steak had no flavor on the salad, just ok.  A manager never came over to our table to asked if we were happy with our food after sending it back. I won't be back.

Basic robotic hello and welcome .  I remember when this place first opened (and I've even been to the summerlin location) the kindness jumped out at you! You could tell people working there loved their job!  When we got our food every single item was cold even our soup! Fries cold, waffle cold and sandwich soggy. I have no idea what has happened to one of what we used to think was an awesome addition to our side of town.  My brother even ordered a burrito and it was cold. His soups though were actually hot.  Unfortunately it was a waste of almost $80 .... also once we had food delivered we weren't even checked on. All together one of worst experiences we've had at Skinny Fats especially because we know they have much better standards.",

This is the item we order all the time. Super spicy buffalo sauce. I ate this then the black bean burger so I'm not sure what made my mouth the kick.   Truffle fried and sweet potato fries-obviously both were delicious. My 2 yo ate both but favored the sweet potato fries.   Also ordered the HangOver juice which my friend really liked.

The nine grain bread is sturdy enough to stand up to tuna, veggies, and teriyaki sauce. The truffle fries were hot, crispy, and tasty. My companion had the Chickawaffledoplis. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and crispy fried. The waffle was fluffy and light. The two together are a great pair. We also got a soda and it is with it to note they don't have the typical sodas on tap. I had a delicious creme soda that greatly enhanced my meal. I can't wait to go back!",

The girl took our order came back there but never bothered checking on us.  This going over 30 minutes and still nothing.   So, the food was bagged to go and been sitting there for over 30 minutes. Girl was trying to get food out of the bag and put it on plates to serve. Are they for REAL!!!  We paid $31 dollars for 2 burgers. Seriously,  you were going to serve us soggy fries with cold burgers. We asked for refund which took another 15 minutes.

I decided on the spicy Latina soup and hummus with pita bread. They have some cute names like yummus (hummus) which is brilliant and I'm jealous I didn't come up with that. The drink cups are actually very sturdy and are made to be reused. So you can even put them in the dishwasher. They also have an option to recycle them at the restaurant instead of just throwing them in the trash. This is cool, you know, save the earth and all. The food was very tasty and fresh. The employees were nice and helpful. It was clean and I liked the atmosphere. My only complaint is that the portion to price was off. I don't mind paying for quality, but it was a little over $10 for 1/4 cup of hummus, a small pita bread, cup of soup, and small drink. I was honestly still hungry when I was done. I guess this is the skinny part in the name cause you will get skinny using their portion control.",

You will be immediately greeted by people who are passionate about their job and it Truest shines through. I asked some help from Tony, the front cashier for some recommendations. He was excited that it was my fiance and my first time and went through the menu with us explaining throughout and highlighting his personal favorites. He even told us some information about what the owner likes to eat. We purchased all that Tony recommended and were not disappointed!! Everything was prepared and cooked perfectly. Warning: once eating skinny fats fries you will no longer be happy with anywhere else's (but it's worth it). The shift lead at the store introduced herself and make sure we were taken care of. This restaurant is more than refreshing, and delectable. The staff at Skinnyfats will give you an experience like no other! We will definitely be back for more!!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so bad but it was only so so. The location is awesome and the design of the restaurant is awesome. Being that it was our first time I looked at the menu prior to going, so I had an idea what I wanted. That being said when you walk in you order at the counter, so you either have to look at the menu on the screens or on a paper menu. Ordering took a tad longer then I would have thought it would but  I got the children's chicken fingers and fries, children shakes, Balls 2.0, fried pickles, steakation (with sweet potato fries) and swinology (with regular fries). The kids enjoyed their chicken and fries and their shakes. The fried pickles were ok but they were served with some weird sauce that I found off putting. The Balls 2.0 were ok, the balls themselves had no flavor but the sauce they were served with helped a lot. I had the steakation and found it very, very dry. For the amount of bun there was I think it needed to have some sauce or something because it just felt dry. Even when I tried to just eat the inside of the sandwich without the meat everything was dry. My husband had the swinology and said it was ok and he could live without coming again. We like to drink water and so if you opt not to get a soda and want water be prepared to get up a couple times during your meal to do so, or grab more then one cup. They have white cups for water that are about the size of a kids cup.",

I didn't even know about SkinnyFats until yesterday afternoon haha. Firstly, I was amazed at their menu options. Loved the breakdown of the menu & the healthy | happy sides of the menu. The selection was impeccable, the meals were unique, pricing was fair, & there were vegan, vegetarian & gluten free options available! Secondly, I was blown away by how KIND, RESPECTFUL, PROMPT & HAPPY the service / employees were at this location. You could tell that everyone genuinely likes to represent their business & that is something that is lacking at most establishments these days. The cashier was courteous & greeted us upon coming in, she took the time to break down the menu for us & go over the craft beers available. She knew the menu & made recommendations. I got the Zucc It bowl- 8/10 (a little spicy but so delicious  the zucchini noodles were filling & the veggies in it were amazing) I also got the Healthy Hangover juice- 10/10 (the cashier was kind enough to sub the celery with orange for me), & a lemon blueberry cookie - 9/10, would give 10/10 if they were vegan or gluten free but it was still sooo good  (which the very kind lady comped for me after I waited in line to get a box when I didn't have to lol. What place is that cool!? That's so nice of them. Seriously.) My boyfriend got the Ahi tacos which were full of flavor-10/10, truffle fries 10/10, a raspberry beer 8/10 (has a tart yet very sweet taste but pretty good). Our friend came with us & was a few people behind in line but they brought his food out at the same time as ours! All around the service was impeccable. Restaurant was very clean, they had eco friendly bathrooms / sinks, the seating selection was nice. I could go on. Shoutout to the people on shift yesterday, you all were amazing & I will be back to this location for that alone! (:",

I have never had a complaint about the food, EVER :) Normally we always get the Chix on Broadway and the Sweet Cheese Us, our two all time favorites. This time I had the buff chx and it was delicious. Very moist! Great taste and can never go wrong with the truffle fries. They are one of the best truffle fries I've ever had. The reason I've chose to give 4 stars is because of the price increase... I don't believe it was necessary. The food is great, always has been but I won't be going as much as before because the price is above average. The interior is beautiful and they did a great job with this location. Keep up the good work skinnyfats, maybe think about putting prices the back to the same as your other locations...",

She came over and explained everything and was so friendly. Throughout the meal I felt like everyone that was working there was just as nice as could be. They all made sure everything was ok even as and after they were closing. I did not feel rushed. Tony, Adrianna, Brandon, Kate & of course Zia are all wonderful people. I will definitely go back again and again. The prices are very reasonable and the food is flavorful and unique. I just cannot get over how amazing the service was especially for not being a high end expensive restaurant.",

I had the TeriyAHI and the flavors were so amazing and the bread I feel like really made the sandwich especially with the sesame seeds. Kids got a burger the only thing that bummed me on that was that I was told they are small so I got two instead of one like I normally do. I have twins and they always share and even then they don't ever finish. I guess lesson learned on that. Husband got the meltdown and he said the spicy aioli was really good. Also had the truffle fries and again really good. If I had one negative it would be that there aren't any drink options for kids. All they have is soda and my kids don't drink that. They had a fruit smoothie which my daughter loved but my son not so much. The decorations are really cool with all the wood on the walls and art. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Giving this 1 star because of the terrible encounter I had when I had dined here a couple days ago.  I had come in with my husband and kids. The girl at the counter was sweet, she took our order and then gave us a number to go sit down. She had given us tips on what some of her favorite items were on the menu she enjoyed so we decided to listen to her advice. When the food arrived it was displayed very beautifully on the plate. I had ordered the Bleu Balsamic and my husband ordered the 'Blaze of Thunder'. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked and well prepared! Now, the major concern I had was for 'Tony'. Not sure if he was a buss boy or a server, he kept staring at me in a very uneasy way. As I was finishing up my lunch, I got up to ask for a TO-GO box and he kept insisting on talking to me. He then continued to ask me for my number when he very well knew I was taken and married. I was very shocked at how careless he was towards my uncomfortable body language. We won't be returning to this location, but definitely going to be returning to Skinny Fats else where!  Other than that, excellent food.",

I actually had a pretty healthy meal from the \"happy\" side. I recommend looking at the menu ahead of time seeing as this is a order and sit restaurant. Can't remember what I had but it was pretty much some vegetables and meat with syrup and my wife had a red velvet waffle with fried chicken that was pretty good but the chicken was over cooked and lacked spice.My mother ordered a waffle as well with fruit, unfortunately it was not added at the register and the waitress reviewed the order and asked if we would like to get in line to pay for it. This may be something the restaurant could improve on... as well as the coffee.",

On this visit, I picked a item that is not on the regular menu board, the big PARM. This is a huge sandwich that you will defiantly need a to go box for. The selection gives you so many choices regardless if which side you order from that you cannot get bored here.  There are TV's with sports on to regular daytime shows so you can chill and watch a game or just hang out. There is an outside dining area so if you want to enjoy the nice Vegas fall season, this is a perfect time for al fresco dining.  I enjoy being part of their juice club as it is easy to get fresh made juices at a reasonable price as juices can get really expensive.   In conclusion, if you on the fence, I would give it a try, its a unique dining experience and I know they are expanding in the valley, my recommendation is the BIG PARM.",

I looked at the sandwich and the chicken didn't look anything like what I'm used to or what is advertised. I asked if they forgot the seasoning and she notified me that a recipe change happened. I expressed how it made me felt and she wasn't empathetic, her body language told me she didn't care. Props to the kitchen on cooking the food great, but the customer service from the lobby isn't up to par. If you want a chicken sandwich you're better off going to chick fil-a. You'll save money too and better customer service. I have attached the advertised photo from Skinny fats Facebook for their blaze of thunder and the photo of what I recurved today. I ate my chicken sandwich and was greatly dissatisfied with the lack of spice. The previous \"BOT\" would give you a runny nose and a slight cough accompanied with a refreshing body feeling. All I got from the \"BOT\" today was a stomach full of disappointment. The sandwich doesn't deserve to be called \"BOT\", it is now just thunder.",

I asked for regular fries and there was still hints of truffle oil on them and they were so stale and cold, like they have been sitting in a bowl in the kitchen for an hour. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken wrap on the 420 menu and it had about a pound to much of buffalo sauce in it. It was completely drenched in buffalo sauce.

I noticed that I hadn't received a regular size drink only 2 kids drinks. I proceeded to the cashier and politely asked her if she had charged me for an adult drink or just the kids drink? I didn't know since I didn't get a receipt. She told me I had only paid for the kids drinks. I said okay, after you're done with them (My friends that were ordering), can you charge me for an adult drink. She said yes and as I went to pull my wallet out of purse, she slammed the cup down and yelled at me to \"just take it!\" I don't know what I did to upset her. I took the cup confused, went to my purse pulled 3 dollars out and put them in her tip jar. I'm not asking for charity. I didn't deserve to be talked to in that way. To this day I have no idea what I did to deserve that. For that reason alone I will not be back here.   Out of respect for my friends I made no fuss. I didnt ask to speak to her manager. I waited for my meal, ate and left.  Updated: After my initial one star review, I was messaged by Jennifer (The Manager). She was very kind, asked me questions about the time and date of my visit and apologized for my experience. I appreciate how she took the time to read my review and for that I've updated my review and added 2 stars. The food was good and all the other employees were nice and helpful. I feel better knowing that no one else will be treated the way I was, it was embarrassing. If my friends want to come back here, I'll gladly a company them and give this place another try.",

I love that there are so many options on the menu and good prices. I had the Cluc Moo...delicious, especially when I added Cholula on it! I devoured it! Hubby had the Power Berry (or something like that) waffle, it came with orange agave drizzled with berry sauce, topped with fresh berries and turkey bacon. He really enjoyed it all! The turkey bacon was delicious! I need some of that for home!  We REALLY like this place, wish they had one in Arlington/Mansfield, TX! Hint hint",

    "text": "After my mom was  recently diagnosed with celiac disease I decided to make gluten-free options more available in my diet. So I work about 5 mins from their N Decatur location & decided to give them a try. First and foremost, the dining room was SQUEAKY CLEAN (the bathrooms were also very well kept) OMFG the Naked Chix bowl was absolutely amazing...so good. I was blown away by the quality of both the food and the customer service. Georgio took my order and there was another worker (a young man who's name tag I forgot to look at!) But he was on the assembly line in front & had my order ready in a relatively quick amount of time. Tiffani helped bag up and hand out my order. All the cooks in the back looked happy to be there & I didnt mean to eavesdrop on them but they were talking about rap/music and comparing artists. I love seeing a happy workplace, especially in the food industry...thats very important to me as a customer to know the staff is productive and happy. Keep up the good work TEAM! I really appreciate you all - this new 'gluten-free' journey had me scared until I had your food! THANK YOU A MILLION TIMES OVER for the support you unknowlying gave me! I appreciate you all!",

I really like the concept of healthy versus not so healthy on the menu. The prices of the juices were amazing. I believe I paid three dollars for my Green Mile juice. And it tasted great. My girlfriend and I decided to order the Caulifire, the Avocatoast, the Buff Chix, and Naked Chix.  The Caulifire was delicious, but not as good as vegenation. It could've tasted more buffalo-ish. The Avocatoast was delicious, very flavorful. But the serving in my opinion is small. And I think that's only in my perspective cause it was delicious. The buff chix was delicious. The fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned. The tenders were delicious and a bit spicy. My girlfriend ordered the naked chix and said it was delicious. We will definitely be back because there's a whole menu to explore.",

I got the Blueberry Yum Yum which is French toast with blueberry jalapeno jam. Sad to say it wasn't much to my liking. I think it's more of an acquired taste but still glad I tried it.

    "text": "SkinnyFATS is a really fun place to eat. The menu is divided into the Healthy side and the Happy Side. I have chosen from both sides, my husband and daughter only choose from the Happy side. The menu states the calorie count for the Healthy side, but not for the Happy side. Maybe if you knew how many calories the Happy side had you wouldn't choose much from that side. I don't know. Some people don't care about that when they go out. At any rate, they have something cool for everyone. Sometimes they have items that aren't on the menu. They are on the wall shown on the little TV screens where you wait in line to place your order. This is gourmet type food with non gourmet prices.  The entrees are $7-$14.  My husband likes their soda made with cane sugar. Some people get excited about that. They are interesting flavors, not just the regular coke and sprite type. I don't get the juice because I don't want to spend a lot of money on a drink. The cookies are very good.   In my opinion the best of the Healthy side is the STEAKation. Yummy...really and truly. Last time I ordered something called Pilgrimamedic (not sure of the title). It is just for November. Sooo good. Turkey ham on a waffle made of corn bread stuffing ingredients with fried green beans with some cranberry sauce with an over easy egg on top covered with some hollandaise type sauce and a few sugared cranberries. Wow!  My taste buds were very happy. Not sure what side that was from. Probably the Happy side. I just discovered that they have the breakfast menu all day. I'm going to try that next time.   The decor is interesting. They have TVs which doesn't make me happy. Apparently some people cannot survive without TV every waking hour. The staff are very pleasant and they seem happy which is good. They have some booths, bar seating near the kitchen and a huge table in the middle that multiple parties can sit at with chunky barstools that are hard to move and not extremely comfortable. I'd rather sit at a booth, but they don't have many of those. They also have a little outdoor enclosed eating area. They do have some free standing tables with chairs near the front windows which are not very inviting or cosy.   All in all... this is a fun place to go when you don't want to spend too much money and you have people who have different taste desires. We bring out of towners here when they visit.",

Instead I got no sauce. ZERO. Which is ridiculous seeing that I even asked for extra and it was on the receipt. My boyfriend also ordered friend pickles and received no sauce either.The staff needs to get it together and make sure orders are complete. I'm just sick of looking forward to my meal and always being disappointed when something is missing. Safe to say I won't be eating here anymore.",

Sweet Cheese Us - This might have been a bit too overly cheesy for me but the name says it all. The meat is very tender. 3.steakation - the meat is very flavorful. This meal tastes very healthy and earhty. Loved it! 4. Mealtdown - now this puppy is hearty! Lots of meat - the sweet potatoe fries are crunchy which i like. Now this meal is for someone that is very hungry. 5. Chicken and waffles - the chicken is crispy yet tender and juicy with a good seasoning. A very good dish as well.  We live in California and its safe to say we will be back when we go back to Vegas. I wish they had one of these in California!   ****DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT TRYING THE SPICY LATINA***",

Since I didn't want to have to leave home, I had it delivered. It took a couple of hours to get it. I was quite surprised that it was basically a greasy mess - both the meat on the sandwich and the fries. The only saving grace was that the meat was very flavorful. Even though, I had specifically asked for catsup, I didn't get any. I'm hoping that this was just an aberration and not a new norm for quality.",

While this place has a \"healthy\" and a \"happy side\" I always stick to the happy side because well ...YOLO!!! So far I have had the classic burger, the cherry poper burger, the chix on broadway sandwich, and the hot chix salad. Out of all of these my favorite has been the chix on broadway sandwich. The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal. One time my husband's burger was over done and they quickly prepared him a new one and comped an extra side for him. SkinnyFats is a great place to catch a casual dinner, however I have yet to try their amazingly delicious looking  breakfast menu. It is definitely on my to do list though!!!!!",

I decided to try items off secret and regular menu.  Tortilla Soup- Super spicy, but not much flavor. The chips and cheese on top were tasty. Chicken Taquitos- Dry and bland. The chicken didn't taste seasoned. Thai Burger- the combo of flavors and texture sounded great, but was not executed. The pineapple was the only thing that gave flavor. Bun was fluffy. Hummus- Not smooth, tasted oily. Hint of garlic for flavor  Strawberry Lemonade- Not sweet, no flavor of strawberry. My food arrived hot and well packaged,  but just not feelin it. The names of the menu items were cool and flavor combos pulled me in, but flavor left me hangin. Not sure if I would try again.",

I didn't care for the extra spice on my chicken sandwich,  very powdery on first bites.  Bottom line is we did enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "In my mind I refer to this place as FATTYFATS. Even though they fresh press their juice, source healthy, organic foods when they can, and include tons of healthy options, the food is so good that I want to eat all the things when I come here.  This is truly some of my favorite food when I'm in Vegas. No one beats them for quick service. I have not tasted a single dish here that I don't like. Want some curry? Check! Want chicken and waffles? Check and check. Want a grass fed burger? That's a big green check! If you want a killer steak sandwich that is melt in your mouth spectacular? This is the place for you (maybe have two?....It's healthy, right?). Their kids meals are also fantastic since everything is made fresh. You don't get some lame, run of the mill mac and cheese, it's the good stuff. On top of that they have great options for sides like jalapeno cornbread, truffle fries, sweet potato fries and hummus (or as they aptly call it: yummus).   Let's be honest, SkinnyFATS would have won my heart simply because they serve breakfast all day and use food puns in their names (and lots of them...seriously, who wouldn't want to eat something called the Sweet Cheese Us?). Thankfully it won my heart because the food is out of the world as well!",

I love that they have healthy options and more hearty options on the menu, the menu is so diverse there is something for everyone. We loved this spot so much we ate here twice within two days!  The Vegewich burger was amazing, I love portobello mushroom burgers and am very picky when it comes to them. This met all my expectations, it was flavorful and filling. The bread they use for the bun is delicious, the sweet potato fries rule. I have never liked sweet potato fries until I tried theirs, they sure do something magical to them.   We still talk about this spot, and rumors have been about that one will be opening near me in SLC in the future. I hope the rumors are True because we will frequent if so!",

At least compared to the original Dean Martin one and Downtown Summerlin. It's located within a strip mall near Costco and features a nice little outdoor patio as well. The set up is easy to follow, you walk in to the ordering counter right away of you and tables are to the right.   As for the food I usually tend to stick to the healthy (yet still very tasty) side. My go tos are the vegwich burger, yummus, the mean bean or the tru-nuts. Everything I've tried is really delicious and they also have a few pressed juices available. It's a perfect spot for those looking to be healthy, or not. They also have quite a bit of vegan/vegetarian options.   They're always a winner in my book and I love to see more locations popping up!",

The lines can get long sometime even out the door, but it moves quickly. Food can take up to 10 minutes to get, but there isn't a need to rush here. I feel a more chill vibe with the communal table in the middle where people can eat next to one another. There are numerous TVs around if that is your thing. Patio seating is a place where I haven't been yet due to the weather.  Service has been consistently friendly. The dishes that I have ordered range from soup, salad, tacos, burgers, AvocaToast, and more. All of which I have been a fan of except the AvocaToast(vegan option). Don't forget to try their catchups and other sauces which you can buy to enjoy at the house.",

Wish they could do better with the face to face guest experience. This will be the last time we eat here for a long while.  I got the buff chix and I saw the cook toss my chicken in the sauce then throw it into the oven ( the oven I can see from my table) and when I got my chicken it was well over done and dry.

Uber Eats is offering 15$ towards your first order. This is a crazy promotion that sounded to good to be True but I ordered 14.95$ in food and tipped 4$. My total was 3.95$, I paid for it on my card. The delivery man was at my house at exactly the estimated time. It said 12:15, and he was there at my house at 12:15. Crazy how efficient these guys are. I didn't have to talk to one person on the phone. The food was exceptional. For just a classic cheeseburger, it was easily one of the best burgers I have had to date. Will be back, especially if uber keeps doing promos like this. Keep up the good work guys, 5 stars.",

What I do remember is coming in for a fulfilling lunch after a night of festivities. I chose a healthier option for the sake of my nausea, yet my meal had just the right amount of saltiness & savoriness to enchant my hangover (with enough to spare for later in the day). I tried my friend's less healthier options (they got the Buff Chix and the Chickawaffadopolis), both which did not disappoint--fresh and savory with that nice \"dirty\" feeling to satisfy your stomach after a night of imbibing. To top it off, they have a cool craft beer selection if you haven't had enough, along with a unique hippie ambiance. Whether you're looking for skinny or not-so-skinny alternatives, this place is definitely worth consideration for anyone's morning after.",

I had one of their fresh juices, it was labeled like 3 days old, but it was not expired yet, and it tasted as if someone had just squeezed it. Delicious!!   Their menu is fun- it does lack pictures considering how detail and creative the names sound. You can order at the counter, or you can grab a menu and sit down.   I ordered a sandwich with fruit and my friend ordered their chicken and waffles. She said their chicken and waffles were better than Roscoe's!!  Everything was super tasty, full flavors without overpowering each other.   The coffee! Oh their deserves a paragraph of their own! I usually like to drink my coffee black to get the full taste of this liquid gold. SkinnyFats' coffee is great! Bold, fresh and served in a lovely cup.   The staff is incredible! Prompt, helpful, extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. I will definitely come back and try something else!",

The decor is reclaimed wood- I really like that aesthetic. The food and atmosphere deserve 5 stars. But. I entered and ordered at the counter - a \"bleu balsamic\" from the healthy side of the board, while my husband made a happy choice(!) along with a side of spicy, yummy \"cauliFIRE,\" we included the requested gratuity (which always seems strange in a place with counter service), then took our number and a seat. My dish came out incorrect, so I walked up to the front to return it and was only told, \"you weren't charged enough for that.\" The server quickly came over and promised to fix it at no charge but then forgot to send in my correct choice until about 10 minutes later (it's an open area, we could see and hear everything). My husband was finished before my food ever arrived, and I didn't receive so much as an apology. I will try again- their food is that good- and will hope this was a one-off as far as customer service is concerned.",

The menu features a \"Healthy\" and a \"Happy\" side, making it a great place to eat whether you're on a diet or treating yourself to something nice. I've tried a variety of menu items with my past visits, and I have not been disappointed with any of them. The staff is always friendly and actually seem genuinely happy to be working there. The tables have come equipped with a variety of signature condiments, such as \"Chipotle Catchup\", as well as regular ones, like Heinz ketchup. As for their drinks, they have a big jug of ice cold cucumber lemon water, and their fountain drink selection isn't the usual Coke or Pepsi products. I believe it was Boylan Bottling, which offers cola, cream soda, and even black cherry soda (my favorite!). Overall, my experiences dining here have been very positive ones, and I would definitely recommend eating here!",

We decided to stop in on a Thursday in hope of a smaller crowd, but to our surprise it was still very busy. We waited about 15 minutes in line to order by the time we ordered we were lucky a family had finished and were able to sit at their table since seating was scarce. My kids ordered shakes and hamburgers. My husband ordered the big parm, and I ordered the nice to Greek you. My kids burgers were the first to arrive to the table along with the big parm. We waited an extra 15+ minutes for the kids shakes which by that time they had finished their dinner. All while I still waited for my flatbread. I honestly thought they forgot my meal but later Alana came to our table to apologize for the wait and refunded my entree. I was hoping they would of worked out their kinks by now but will probably wait a while before we return.",

First of all, you have to wait in a super long line which they purposely make you wait in because they don't want too many food orders to go into the kitchen at once. However standing there, especially with kids, is not the way they should do business. Their salads are way too expensive for the portion that you get. I had the chicken and waffles today. The waffle was tough and my chicken was soggy. The atmosphere is great and the people are really nice, but the food is very hit or miss. The one positive thing is the cookies are amazing! Even though I got my cookies to go and when I got home they gave me the WRONG cookies. Nevertheless, they were still very good. Hopefully, since this place is still new, they get their act together and fine-tune the establishment and kitchen. I've been to the other two locations and never had a problem with the food.",

I totally think the service here rocks when most order and pay type establishments really don't offer much service at all.   The food has been pretty solid. I have favorites on the menu: caulifire, teri-ahi sandwich, smotherload (ask for more sauce!),more cow bowl. And there's always something different on their secret menu, their 420 menu, a different weekend or monthly benedict and Sunday Sundae. What's cool and what sucks about the various benedict and sundaes is that they don't repeat... I've had some favorites (chicken curry benedict called curry underwood, and a carrot cake waffle sundae). I really like the ma the meatloaf sandwich and blaze of thunder spicy chicken that's off menu.   I tried Skinnyfats years ago in the OG location and my impression was pretty \"meh\" due to execution. What a difference a few years and location makes! I've actually gone back to that location and the SW one.... This one is THE location! The food is cooked better, the staff is more on it. I've been about a dozen times and only had one day that they looked short staffed so they really weren't at fault for that day being subpar.   I'm glad this isn't far from my house! If I don't know what I want to eat I just go to skinny fats",

    "text": "Finally! It's about time the Northside gets some cool restaurants. That means less gas and time wasted traveling across town for this gem of a restaurant.   Unlike the Dean Martin location, this place is much more spacious and have plenty of seating (yes, no more table hogging like savages). Of course, their interior is definitely up to par with their other locations; super hippie and great for pictures! haha. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable of the menu so no worries if you have any questions.  Just like their other locations, they provide, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free options; so this is great for a group of people with different lifestyles.  So here's what my friend and I got: --Salmon Overboard: A cucumber boat with a generous slab of buttery salmon topped with a creamy spicy slaw. Great appetizer or mini entree if you're not too hungry. It comes with 4 pieces and is listed under 'Shareables' in the menu, but honestly I ate it all to myself. lmao.  --Naked Chix: Chicken topped with a mango basil sauce placed on top of cauliflower rice. I've never tried cauliflower rice before but I am quite impressed! Although it tastes nothing like normal rice, it still is a great alternative for those eating low carb.  Altogether, a great first impression of this place! They're about to open an extension called Coldpress Express so I'm definitely looking forward to that!",

    "text": "Long time Skinny Fat customer and I love their food BUT unfortunately the Decatur location does not hold up to the Skinny Fat standard set by their original location and their Warm Springs location.    To start off with the Balls 2.0 fell short from the ones we had at Warm Springs. They were dry and solid like an over cooked meatball and the aioli sauce fell flat. (Warm Springs did an amazing job on the Balls 2.0)   I also ordered an VG bowl dish that I can't recall the name but it had noodles, curry sauce and topped with fried chickpeas. It sounded amazing but when it came (and after the waitress left) I noticed no chickpeas. Being a vegetarian dish the chickpeas was equivalent to ordering More Cow Bowl and not getting any meat.   Maybe I missed the chickpeas? It's possible. So I rooted around my bowl for a bit like a hungry stray dog looking for a treat but couldn't find any. I asked my wife and she came to the same conclusion soooo I notified the waitress. The waitress was very apologetic and said she'd have the cook make me a side of fried chickpeas on the double. 10 minutes later, my dish getting slightly colder as I sat there patiently waiting as child waits for mom to finish dinner a different waitress/staff member came up to me to advise that they're almost ready.  My wife was finishing up her meal and mine still sitting there flaccid and cold chickpealess when my chickpeas finally arrive. The chickpeas were hot, crunchy and delicious. It would have complimented my meal well (when it was still warm).  My suggestion is to go to the warm springs or the Original location. Save yourself the trouble of a disappointing meal and take the extra drive.",

It's a cup of soup which is not a creamy soup but a True tomato soup with lots of great flavor. The grill cheese comes on grilled Parmesan toast with a few different kinds of cheese which gives it really grea flavor. The sandwiches are very large servings which each time I have had half a sandwich to take home. The servers are fantastic and very attentive checking to make sure everything is ok once food is delivered. I have brought my vegetarian daughter here and there was plenty for her to choose from. My son also enjoyed his chicken sandwich when he came to visit. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and I have eaten here for all three and have yet to be disappointed with anything. Prices are ok for what they serve. They also have some great desserts that they offer as well, but I have to be honest, I never have any room left and have yet to try any of them. This is a must try, I don think you will regret it.",

We both had a Thai Five burger with truffle fries and we were both very satisfied with our food and the staff! Our food was perfect! The burgers have spicy peanut slaw, fried onion straws, grilled pineapple and pepper jack cheese on a fabulous burger patty served on a brioche bun. The slaw and cheese were spicy but that was well balanced by the grilled pineapple. No condiments necessary!   The staff were friendly and helpful, as always! They hire some of the nicest young, energetic people!

The interior is airy with a good amount of seating; the decoration is rustic and hip. The menu has 2 separate sides: healthy and happy (unhealthy). Both sides have plenty of delicious choices from a simple mixed green salad to a fully carbs loaded pasta bowl. My fiance and I got \"Nice to Greek you\" and \"Fresh Morning\" and they were both pretty good, except for the \"Fresh Morning\" was a bit dry and could use a little more sauce. My favorite part about SkinnyFats is that they have Birch Beer as one of their fountain drink selections. This drink is kinda similar to root beer but better and it is so hard to find in Vegas. Overall, I rate this place 4 stars and will most likely come back.",

Sometimes it takes quite some time to get your food (even if it isn't busy), but it is always worth it!",

The Manager Lana got right back and promised to remedy the problems. I finally went back last night and she really did her job. Portions are bigger and customer service. They are lucky to have a manager who cares and really knows how to do the job. She is great. I will definitely be back. Probably next week lol. I highly recommend this place. Good people great management and delicious food. Thank you again Lana",

The dude working the register was super helpful, explained a ton to us (first timers) and made some really good recommendations. We were not at all disappointed. I got the cheese steak (i forget the menu name =/) and my fiance got the cherrypopper, and holy sh*t, they were SO good. The cheese steak was actual, tender, juicy, delicious meat, the cheese sauce was to dieeeeeeeee for and the peppers, onions, and shrooms were just ugh. It was SO good! Idk what was on the house salad, but it was absolutely delicious. Simple, but everything you could ever need or want in a side salad. The burger was cooked to perfection, the cheese, the egg, ugh, it was all just DIVINE! The truffle fries were bomb too! Washed it all down with a fresh strawberry lemonade ( you get free refill) that was perfectly sweet and sour. The atmosphere here is also super dope. They have booth seating, outside seating, a community table, and bar style seating. It's super chill, the staff was all super duper nice, and the food was just amazing. I honestly can't wait to go back. Love that they have a healthy side( everything is 600 cals or less I believe) and a \"happy\" side to the menu too. Will absolutely, positively be back next time I'm on that side of town!",

It might be on the super secret menu your wasteline doesn't want you to know about...hense, the secret part!  It is my husband's fav. So we visit only in moderation.    I have been here 3 or 4 times. It is a little pricey, but worth it now and then. I wanted to try everything on the Skinny menu, but on the 4th visit I got a very bland chicken rice dish that I really should have sent back or asked about. I have not been back sense.   The vibe in the NW Location is very upbeat. The food is very good. We love the quaint community setting and can't believe we had driven by it so many times without ever realizing it was there!

So we went over at around 2:30  to try it out. I am so glad we did! The place was very busy, but the line went fairly quick. And the food was excellent! Very good quality and at a very fair price. My husband got one of the hamburgers and a strawberry shortcake sundae that was on special. I got Happy chicks (bacon, eggs, sausage, etc.) and Blueberry Yum Yum. It was a ton of food and of course I couldn't eat it all. But there were so many choices that we wanted to try everything!  And we have been there two more times this week! I took my friend and my daughter. This is my new favorite breakfast place!",

Came here on day 1, got the blazewich, simple and derish, my hubby got the cherry popper always a favorite with truffle fries (so yum). But the soup! Spicy Latina may be the best soup I've ever had. I love soup. It's SO hearty!! And the spice! The flavor! Perfect! Glad skinnyfats came to my side of town! And of course, glad to have a beer with dinner.",

Donte & Anthony were top-notch and offered us 5-Star service from the moment we walked in to the moment we left! They answered all of our questions, anticipated our needs. They even went to the back to get the name of the Pandora station that was playing throughout the restaurant! Kudos to you both, your warm personalities and the customer service you provide! If I had my own business, you'd both be the type of guys I'd want welcoming my customers with as soon as they walked in the doors! There's so much to rave about, but let me also add. I RARELY drink soda or sugary beverages, but the soda fountain here has sodas made with cane sugar & extract oils. They are not too sweet, they are delicious! The bill with an appetizer, 2 main dishes, 2 fountain drinks & dessert was roughly $32.00 With places like this, I don't think I need to go to another chain restaurant anytime soon!",

So I had the 'hot chix' salad and Mike had the 'more cow bowl'. Both were delicious. However, we did wait 20+ minutes on our entrees and my salad was delivered 7-10 minutes before Mike's food arrived BUT the manager noticed and took care of us with a full refund. We did not ask or complain at all, and they took the initiative to take care of us. I understand that it is the first week of opening and the staff is just getting used to everything, we appreciate your hospitality. Thank you again, we will be back.

I told them of the issue, but stated I wanted NOTHING in return, not a refund, anything.  Before I left, the manager walked up to me and gave me a rather large gift card because they went to the kitchen and it turns out I saved them a days worth of headaches!  Love this place.

    "text": "After a few visits, I think I'm in a serious relationship with this place.  The atmosphere is cool, the menu contains more than enough options, and regardless of which side of the menu you order off of (Happy or Healthy), you're going to be stuffed (or leave with a to-go box).  Speaking of the menu, be warned: even if you order off the healthy side, you're going to feel guilty because of how good everything tastes, and probably because of how much you'll end up eating.   Here are a few of my favorites:  try the \"S'motherload\" burrito (Happy side), the\"Sweet Cheese Us\" (Happy side) and the \"Caulifire\" (Healthy side).  They have a nice selection of juices, smoothies and shakes on the menu, but I've always grabbed a soda from the fountain.  By the way, the cups for the fountain drinks are sturdy plastic cups.  You can toss them in the recycle bin when you're done, or take them home.  Skinny Fats even lets you know they're dishwasher safe.  So if you have a need for plastic cups at home, these are keepers.  A few other suggests of information:  for those who want breakfast during non-breakfast hours, they serve breakfast all day.  They also offer a military discount.  When you come in and head to the counter to order, take notice of the display that's about chest level along the wall.  It scrolls specials across the screen for you to consider.  It's definitely worth taking a look to see what's featured there.  This location is in a storefront with lots of parking.  You can strut toward the restaurant with great satisfaction since others in the parking lot will see you headed toward deliciousness, and you can quietly laugh at the people who aren't going to eat what you're about to eat.  I've only been to the Decatur location, but there are three others around town.  I'll try more of them eventually, but trust they're all equally good.  Find the one nearest to you and bring your appetite!",

They loaded our plates with lots of fries which was nice.  But... we order med rare for the cherry popper, and received med well. We still inhaled it non the less, but it did erk me a little because for a restaurant like skinnyfats they should pay attention to details.",

Cashiers are always helpful since we've had different ones each time we come in and we always ask their opinion on favorites.   Appetizers we've had:  Balls 2.0- AMAAAAZING, don't question just try it. You won't be disappointed   Truffle fries: although big in size, it lacked flavor and zero truffle flavor. I wouldn't say I'm a truffle fry expert, but I have had my fair share.   Main dishes:  Naked chix: really good, hubb's staple dish  More cow bowl: I'm so disappointed that the beef is so chewy, I've ordered the beef dish twice and still chewy so I've given up ordering anything 'filet mignon' mentioned on their menu. Other than that the taste of the dish is pretty good, just a bummer that the beef is such a disappointment.   Turnip taco: good, yet again the beef was such a downfall. Def would swap out for ahi  Ahi srirachi: soo yummy! Has a kick but nothing major, def a good mix of sweet and spicy",

I ordered a buffalo chicken bowl with a soda. Starting with the soda, they have really cool re-useable dishwasher safe cups that are sturdy and durable. I kept mine, flew home with it and gifted it to one of my kids who was stoked on the emoji design. While there I had several refills of their cream soda which was delicious! My friends kept stealing sips! Within about 10 minutes my food came out and it was delicious, I threw some hot sauce on there for extra spice and made it just a touch too spicy, but kept quenching my thirst with soda ( I eventually moved on to black cherry soda). My meal was a lot for me, I couldn't finish it all-the portion sizes are ample! I was dining with a vegan friend and there were tons of options for her to choose from, I sampled them all and they were all yummy! The bathrooms are clean and spacious. Best of all, this wonderful food is very reasonably priced, but quality-for-value meal I've had in a long time, if not ever.",

SkinnyFATS got me on all kinds of indecision, and it totally affects my ODC.  I mean, it's already hard for me to make a decision on where to eat...let alone what to eat!  So needless to say, it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order.  My family...not so much.  After a brief pause, we ordered:  *T.A.T.S. (healthy) - Turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, spinach and spicy mayo on 9 grain bread  *Cinnutella (happy) - Cinnamon sugar French toast, berries, spiced Nutella, orange agave  *The Big (Bad) Parm (happy & on their secret menu) - Garlic brushed toasted hoagie with breaded chicken, fresh mozzarella and marinara  Overall, good food!  The T.A.T.S was tasty...but would have been 100x better with actual bacon!  Forget the healthy!  Go swiney!  Nice, thick 9 grain bread, lots of fresh avocado and veggies.  Kid was OK with the Cinnutella, but it was hard to distinguish where the actual Nutella was.  Was it supposed to be in that spiced Nutella sauce of sorts?  If so it was light on taste.  The orange agave was good but my kid wasn't too interested in it.  Plus the serving was on the small side for being an actual breakfast entree.  It would have been better with 4 slices instead of just 2.  The Big (Bad) Parm was definitely a BIG sandwich!  Not much in terms of veggies going on here, folks!  Just look at the pic, all I see is red & white!  Carbs, breading, sauce, and more carbs!  But damn did it make me happy!  Crispy garlic bread, fat breaded chicken breast, topped with a load of mozzarella & marinara!  Like an Italian dinner in a bun!  Mangia!  The regular fries and the sweet potato fries at SkinnyFATS were great as well.  Kind of a thinner cut, but fried crisp and easy to eat.  Damn near addictive with their branded ketchups!!  Only issue I have here is that SkinnyFATS isn't exactly skinny on the wallet.  Entree items are a bit on the high side but thankfully for the most part the food is very good.  But don't get me started on those expensive fresh juices!  Near the cost of some actual food!  Wow!  Service for us was friendly, quick, and pretty knowledgeable on both sides of the menu.  I know I asked a lot of questions!  Perhaps on my next visit I'll try something on the healthy side of the menu!  But....maybe not.",

We've tried almost all of their sandwiches and the flavors are always great. The smoothies and juices are amazing as well! Always a must when we order here.  But honestly, their cookies are to die for. Sometimes I come here just to get a cookie!  I had to take one star off because they've been messing up on all our orders recently whenever we order delivery through Postmates. They sometimes forget a cookie, or a drink, or some side items. I don't blame them entirely since all of our Postmates fail to check the order before delivering anyway. Thankfully Postmates doesn't charge us for the missing items and a manager from SkinnyFATS has even reached out to me.",

Been to several of the SkinnyFATS locs and I have not had anything I did not like except the american fries for breakfast and even those were tasty.  I had the Cherry Popper burger this visit.  A big 1/2 lb beef burger topped with a fried egg, sweet and spicy slaw and chopped cherry and banana pepper  served on a Hawaiian sweet roll.  Very tasty flavors and just enough heat but not overpowering.  The beef patty came out a perfect medium temp and was very flavorful.  They should serve this burger with wetnaps because it sure is messy.    I also had to try the Spicy Latina soup. Yum! like a chicken tortilla soup with chunks of onion, jalapeno's, and chicken in a creamy tomato broth with large thick crispy strips of tortilla.  This dish is very spicy so be careful or you might get burned.    Enjoy!",

Just in case you haven't been to SF, I'll educate you a little.  This is the 3rd location in the Las Vegas.  The menu is separated by a Healthy side (the skinny) and a Happy side (not so healthy). Thus the name, SkinnyFATS.    I've been a fan of SkinnyFATS since day one.  And over the years, I found what I really like here.  I usually order their Wrap Supastar (Chicken & Egg White Wrap).  It's my favorite simply because there's so much protein in it. It taste good too. On this visit, I decided to get something off the happy side of the menu.  I got their Meltdown, which is basically a double meat patty melt.  My patty melt was very good and it came with a side of soup. The overall menu consist of Shareables (the apps), Between the Buns (Sandwiches & Burgers), Tacos, Things in Bowls (exactly how it sounds), and Breakfast (I shouldn't have to explain what that is).  Besides the drinks, the prices are very good and the portions are big.  The line was little slow, but it wasn't due to the staff.  The staff was efficient. There is a lot on their menu and the customers in front of us were just a little undecided.    Just a note...currently, this location has items that cannot be found at the other locations.    Just another note...off the menu items can be found on their TV screens by the register.   Just a final note...I love SkinnyFats' initials SF.    2017 Yelp Review #28",

    "text": "Living in the north part of Las Vegas has meant that we need to drive some distances to our favorite eateries, but 2017 is starting off right with the opening of SkinnyFATS' third location.  Located off of the 215 and Decatur near BestBuy, this is excellent news for us because we don't live too far away at all.  We've been fans since the first SF opened on Dean Martin and now we can become regulars here.    What's so great about SkinnyFATS?  The menu offers up the healthy side and the happy side, so depending on what your diet and stomach wants on any given day, you can find an item to satisfy you.  There are also vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options if you need those.  Plus, the staff is friendly and answer any questions you may have about the menu.  Located in an already busy shopping plaza (the Costco side), just head for Massage Envy and BestBuy and you'll find it.  I'm giving you directions this way so you don't drive around in circles.  The interior of the restaurant has the cool murals like the other locations, a communal table, booths, and tables, plus several flat-screens.  The menu here boasts items that the other locations don't have, too.  We had dinner here last night and the joint was jumping.  There was a line to the door for ordering, but I didn't really mind since they did just open and it gave us a chance to peruse the menu.  I went with the Healthy Side's T.A.T.S.:  turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, and spinach on 9 grain toast, skipping the spicy yo sauce because I'm a wimp.  This comes with a side and I decided to get happy with truffle fries:  balance!  It was a great little meal and I'd have this healthier version of a BLT again.  I tried the b/f's Spicy Latina soup side and it was spicy, but very tasty, so try this chicken soup with tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese if you're in the mood. For a first visit at a location that just opened its doors, we left with our Happy Meter reading at \"overjoyed.\"  See you soon, SkinnyFATS.",

She definitely made our visit worth while!   We ordered the following:  Berry waffle: delicious!!! From the waffles to the syrup, it was so delicious I forgot to take pictures of the food I ordered! The syrup is runny, but the taste was awesome! I'm a huge fan of turkey bacon so it was a plus that the waffles came with 2 pieces of turkey bacon!   Balls: delicious! Fried risotto balls was Amaze-balls! It was fried to perfection!   Fried pickles: I'm a big fan of fried pickles and these fried pickles were crunchy and the batter actually  stayed on!   Latina soup : it had a kick to it! Do not get if you can't eat spicy! It was good though!   The drinks were amazing too! Got a birch beer, great treat, and one of their punch without bananas!   Overall the food was great and the service and people are great here! I would definitely be back! Thanks Jay for our great first time experience here!",

Great start!  Food was very good. Lots of breaded chicken fingers on a perfectly cooked waffle drizzled with syrup.  The restaurant looks awesome, so fun, clean, bigger than the Warm Springs which I really liked.  All the employees were friendly & attentive.  By the time we left, there was a line for lunch.

I have gone twice to this location and they are the only restaurant that has given me problems about using my reusable cup to buy a skinnyfats punch. And on top of that they have lied to my face about using my reusable cups, because they say that it's against \"health code regulations\" but told me that I can bring a skinnyfats cup and get that refilled, so what's the difference? And after I told them that I worked in a restaurant business and that this was False they just give me a blank stare and blame it on their managers. Well here's the proof about reusable cups and it's sad that they decided to lie instead of just charging me and giving me my drink so I can be on my way.   SOUTHERN NEVADA HEALTH DISTRICT 4-409 Returnables for Refilling 4-409.11 Cleaning and Sanitizing Procedures (B) May, if the container is free of visible dirt or FOOD residue, be refilled for immediate return to the\rcustomer, provided that the act of refilling does not pose a RISK of CONTAMINATION in the FOOD service area.

(3)Containers provided by customers for refilling with water at self-service VENDING MACHINES.  I even brought a mason jar with the OZs on the side of the it so they wouldn't have a hard time figuring out the difference from their 16oz cup on a mason jar.",

The way food is ordered and served is pretty cool too, although it is kinda awkward to stand around for a table if there aren't any ready to sit at.   The service here is excellent! From the cashier to the food runners to the bussers, everyone was super friendly and accommodating.   I got the vegan blue berry yum yum French toast and the avocado scramble.  -French toast was not very good but it was edible. I think they're doing too much with it and could easily simplify the whole dish to make it better.  -The avocado scramble I was actually really looking forward to because I dig a good tofu scramble and I make them for myself all the time. However, it was gross. Over powered by turmeric and garlic, I couldn't eat it. Tone down the spices please!   The staff was VERY understanding that I didn't like my food and offered to remake the dish or make me something new. I just got a juice (hangover) instead and that was really yummy.   My boyfriend got the steakation and LOOOOVED it! The hummus that came out with his burger on the other hand was not so loveable... him and I both tried it and weren't into it and we've tried a lot of hummus.  Not giving up on you though, Skinny Fats! I'll try something new next time.",

So friendly, full of information, attentive to any needs you have...I could go on and on. The atmosphere is friendly and fun.  The decor was, for me, wonderful. Very environmentally friendly. Bar stool bases were made from recycled palates, walls covered with reclaimed wood, and the cups can be taken home (dishwasher safe), or you can put them in the recycle slot. Even the sandwich skewers were wood instead of plastic.  There's something for everyone here, whether you want fish, turkey, chicken, beef or salad. Decadent healthy and yummy sinful fried food too. This place has an amazing concept, fabulous food, and fantastic staff. YOU'LL LOVE IT!",

I'm super picky about my proteins so I feel the waffle could have been a smidge tastier. The orange agave is SUUUUUPER sweet. I probably won't order that next time. I also got the skinnyFATS Punch (minus banana) and OMG it was pure heaven!!!! I will go back and try other items they have but for me, the Berry Strong was a Berry Wrong.

    "text": "Went to this location about 2 weeks ago, and it was BUSY. The line to order food was out the door.   I ordered the One-Eyed Monster, Two-Nuts, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The cashier was really friendly and patient, and engaged in some light conversation while my credit card was processing.   The wait for the food was average, didn't take too long. Taste was good, overall. My FAVORITE thing from my order was the One-Eyed Monster. For $4.95 it's a good size (well, snack size, for me) and a quick breakfast bite. Presentation was cute too. The Two-Nuts was OKAAAY. Presentation was nice, but eating it was hard. The cucumber boat it came in was pretty hard to cut through, and made all the contents spill out, so I ended up just cutting it all up and mixing it together like poke. I love fries, so that's pretty standard, but my fries were not hot when I got them. A little disappointed, but I ate them anyway.   The other reason I am giving them only 3 stars right now is because they don't accept phone orders at this location. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or whatever, but REALLY? Why no phone orders? I may have to edit this if they change their mind. I know I'll be back to this location because it's closer than any of the others, but only due to the lack of dining options in the area.",

Negatives: chix on Broadway was uninspiring (looked good) but was bland, and the chix and waffles suffered from the same lack of seasoning. They do have ketchup like condiments that u can try, however those should b accents to the dish, not the main theme. Again, first time there so will try again, but initial experience was lackluster.",
