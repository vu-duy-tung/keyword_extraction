Very expensive, so make sure you account for that.  But otherwise a great experience.  My fiance and I loved it, an you will too.",

    "text": "I've had Italian food at some of the finest restaurants in Italy while surrounded by local friends, but none were any better than Il Mulino in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  Manager Alisha Rosinek presides over her talented \"second family\" on a mission to create a cathedral for an evening of Italian gustatory pleasures.  She succeeds.  Her head waiters are more like food museum docents as they fire your imagination for each act of the meal performance.  I don't see how the original Il Mulino in New York can compete with it's new branch now that Alisha has been given free reign of  the brand in the desert.  Watching skilled people do what they love to do, create an extraordinary dining experience for you, can't get old.      As soon as you are seated and handed a napkin, a gigantic wheel of hard Parmesan appears at table side and a mouthwatering chuck is placed on your appetizer plate.  From then on, one of many skilled hands is attending to your needs every minute.  Dennis explains that this aroma and taste helps prepare your palate for the flavors to come.  That particular Parmesan is what is used in the kitchen for most entrees.  It quickly become clear that this is a head waiter that loves his food museum.  After that he describe the wines that he negotiated for while he was in Italy directly with wineries--the ones that were NOT being shipped to the US and why he wanted them.  Dennis then explains, from the cooks perspective, how each special of the day is prepared and helps you decide by asking questions.  Pavlov discovered the direct link between the salivary glands and anticipation of food.  Wasn't he really Italian?  Il Mulino rings that bell deliciously.  The appearance of the actual food and wine exceeds your imagination.  These are meals for the senses and those who appreciate the details which created them.  This is a complete evening so don't plan on rushing off to a show.  Il Mulino is the show!",

I had studied the menu for weeks, had picked out the wine I wanted, had planned my outfit. Saying I was excited is honestly an understatement. Of all the things I was prepared to be, disappointed was not one of them.  The service was seriously lacking. For the amount of money we were paying, the service was terrible. Our \"captain\" was terrible. He was far more concerned with the guys next to us buying wine to understand that we wanted to keep the cocktails flowing and get some desserts. The meal took 3.5 hours. If I thought the service was bad, I surely wasn't prepared for the food.  Horribly over-priced poorly crafted food. The \"free\" items they give you are flavorless. I've had better buffalo mozzarella from the pizza place down the street.  As for entrees, there were a variety of options at the table including lobster ravioli, truffle cream ravioli, chicken dishes, and some other things I can't remember. None of them memorable, some barely palatable, all of them over priced.   The best part was I had to go back to the hotel room after dinner because I got sick. Great time...in that not at all way.  I would not reccomend this restaurant to anyone. There are far too many top quality restaurants in Vegas to waste your money here. I wish I had gone to Circo or Sinatra instead.",

The restaurant crammed 15 guests in the room with two six foot tables; 7 guests per side with 1 guest at the far end and the other far end allows servers to squeeze by.  If you do that math that gives each guest 20\" of space which is the same as an economy airline seat.  The experience was far below my expectation of being at a 5 star restaurant.  When I returned to my hotel room I realized 45 minutes in the chair with my arms being pinned against my body has chaffed my sides.  Didn't even have dinner!  Between the antipasto and the primo I got up to ask the Il Mulino staff what could they do to help us out, however, the staffs response was so rude I decided to apologize to my host and leave.",

Once seated they give you two kinds of bread, chunk of excellent parma reggiano, salami and sauteed zucchini (cold) . My wife and I always split a four course meal after learning from our first dinner here about the huge portions and for today's lunch we had spinach with bacon salad, pappardelle with bolognese sauce, baked branzino, and panacotta. The panacotta seems more like a flan but it was still wonderful. We spent $220 without alcohol (includes 20% tip) and it was worth every bite!!",

It was sticky and dry with way too much truffle oil. I ordered the linguine con vongole. I usually have to add red pepper. Thank goodness I tried it first. It was so spicy I couldn't eat it. I have eaten in il Mulino in Atlantic City and New York and there was no comparison to the disappointing food here.  I thought the service was good from the bus staff, not the wait staff. I was disappointed when we chose a wine, (a relatively expensive bottle), and the waiter was not able to explain in the least, even though he had said he has tasted it. He said it was good. Thank goodness it was.  When our second bottle arrived, we were not even offered clean glasses and when we asked, our waiter got annoyed and decanted the wine in the same decanter. All in all, not a good experience, and rather embarrassing for me in the presence of my client.",

At the start of your meal, your server will bring by a spread of complimentary small plates: fried zucchini, an assortment of dry-aged salami and meats; bruschetta, crunchy garlic bread, and a large hunk of Pecorino Romano cheese. It's easy to fill up on the hors d'oeuvres, but you'll want to save room for the main courses.  Seriously, the decadent porcini-stuffed ravioli with black truffle-champagne is easily the best pasta dish I've ever had. The soft, melt-in-your-mouth, freshly-made ravioli in the creamy, luscious truffle sauce is pure ecstasy to the senses. #bestthingieverate",

With waiters dressed in full tux' s and bus boys in white jackets. You can dress casual or dress up its still Vegas. The Food. When you first sit down the food starts coming... Fried zucchini, Reggiano Parm, breads,and  bruchetta before you even see a menu, all gratis. The waiter who introduces himself as the Captain rattles off a number of specials perfectly. Here's your big tip about this restaurant. Order just one thing and split all your selections between 2 people. Besides being pricy the portions are huge. The food is excellently prepare and presently elegantly. Service is very attentive. Their signature dish not on the menu is; mushroom stuffed Ravioli with a black truffle champagne cream sauce. They don't tell you but its $50. More expensive I think then any of the printed menu items. Ask for prices on specials. We also ordered the pappardelle with Bolognese sauce (enough for 3 people) which was very good. Oh yes we had their Caesar salad excellent. The food the service very very good. At the end of your dinner they give you a shot of Grappa.... gratis again. It all felt a little 1950's and 2014 all rapped into one, but don't get me wrong I would go back in a heartbeat knowing the tips I gave you. Its high end fine Italian cuisine prepared like u were in Italy but huge portions. One other point I was not familiar with.... When we got our check there was a tip section, and a Captain tip section. I just left the customary 20%.",

They also serve you complementary fried zucchinis, bruschetta, and mussels.  Then the Captain will proceed to explain an entire book of specials that are not listed on the menu. I kid you not, it felt like an hour passed us by as he explained the specials for the night. Pretty impressive memory. Kudos to him.  I recommend that you don't skip out on the lobster ravioli as an app. It's a very rich and heavy dish, so I wouldn't recommend it for your entree.

So I ate only one bite and call the waiter and I returned the cuisine, because I don't want to get cancer by the burnt food. After that My appetite was gone at all. However, our waiter said to me \"The veal has some burning because this meat was charcoal grilling.\"  Excuse me?Of course I know what is the charcoal grilling, but this is just BURNT!!!!   My husband ordered Carbonara which was Ordinary taste and Ordinary taste reached also appetizer. I was too bad because il Mulino where is in Tokyo was more great and delicious foods. I never visit Il Mulino in Las Vegas.   Anyway, My merciful husband said: the staff was very attentive and friendly, they quickly apologized for the veal, and the carbonara and red wine was great.

    "text": "Il Molino is my absolute favorite restaurant... EVER.   My first experience is at their restaurant in New York City. When I found out they had a restaurant in Las Vegas, it was great news. Every single visit to Vegas, this is a must stop!!  The wait staff is crazy good attentive. The food is out out of this world. And the atmosphere is elegant and charming. It has a great outdoor patio with a beautiful view of the strip.   Seeing that I've been here countless times... I've had the privilege of trying so many delicious dishes! Things I recommend:  Chicken Parmesan Veal Parmesan Carbanera Veal Pork Chops Any pasta with Bolognese sauce Shrimp scampi Mushroom ravioli  Now, this restaurant is not cheap. However, the portions are huge and they shower you with a lot of food - so you really get your moneys worth. When you sit down, before you even get a menu... They give you a fresh chunk of parmesan cheese, sauteed zucchini, fresh garlic bread, fresh bread basket, sliced salami, muscles, and bruschetta.  Did I mention that the bruschetta is out of this world?!  Now, I've never been to Italy (but it is on my bucket list!)... But I have taken people here to eat that of been to Italy. They say this is just as good as any food you will have there.  Do yourself a favor, stop in for the best Italian food you will ever have! I promise you won't regret it :-)",

The prices may be high but all the food they bring out before you even see a menu makes it so worth it. I had the chicken Parmesan and my boyfriend had the rigatoni bolognese and both were excellent. I had mentioned it was my 21st birthday to the hostess and at the end of our meal, our server brought out a candle and flourless chocolate cake which was absolutely impeccable and delicious!!! Would definitely recommend coming here!",

My wife had chicken piccata and I had veal Milanese. Both were very good, but not exceptional. We got 1/2 orders of spaghetti bolognese and bucatini amatriciana , my wife loved the amatriciana. Our drinks were excellent, the Mulino Manhattan was terrific and my wife's Old Fashioned was excellent. Cannoli for dessert was excellent. They also sang happy birthday to my wife and gave her a complimentary dessert, which was very nice. The complimentary grappa at the end was also a nice touch. Overall a very nice meal, but a questionable value for the price.",

They first serve you with a hunk of cheese straight from the cheese wheel.  Then they give you salami, spicy zucchini, and bruschetta.  Our server i believe his name is Daniel, was great!  The way that he explained the specials drew a picture in my mind. I didn't even need the menu when he was finished.   Tried the classic caprese , excellent.  The porcini raviolli was great in the truffle sauce.  Loved the veal chop on the bone so so so good.  When I'm in Vegas I'm definitely coming back!",

We walked in at noon after they opened the doors, girl working the front barely acknowledged we were there. Going to the table we noticed how dirty the carpet was, at dinner the lights are lower. The waiter did not seem happy to be there, big difference from the guy we had before. The food was excellent as before but there is no lunch menu, the portions are the same size and price as dinner options. It was no wonder that the place was empty for the 90 minutes we were there, only one other couple. We will go back but not for another $150 lunch.",

The chef even sends out multiple small plates before you even order- all complimentary. (Sauteed zucchini, a block of fresh Parmesan, salami slices, bruschetta). We ordered the chicken parm, which was literally the diameter of my Plate, manicotti, and fresh gnocci with pesto. Absolutely the best Italian meal we've ever eaten. We finished off the meal-somehow- with a fresh piece of New York style Cheesecake which melted in our mouths. It was THAT good. Finally we were served a complimentary small glass of homemade grappa with a good luck raisin in it. Come dressed to impress and leave the flip flops and athletic wear at the hotel for the evening. Also be sure to make a reservation ahead of time. You will not regret this meal. It was fabulous!!",

I ordered a \"special\" aka old ingredients they want to be rid of as soon as possible. \"Maine\" lobster. So chewy and hard I could not even cut the lobster with my knife. not to mention it had NO FLAVOR, just awful dish. when we got the bill, this entree ended up being $90 too!!!   My boyfriend ordered the fruit de la mer (the ocean) a seafood medley pasta dish. scallops and shrimp were old and hard and fishy. there was also no sauce. just a clam water at the bottom of soggy noodles.  Treated like shit and was stared down the whole time by the host.  wtf. either the chef is awful or they hated us. weirdest attitudes from waitstaff.   should have sent the food back but didn't want to make the bad time even worse. felt violated walking out of there. and now we are sick to our stomachs from the old seafood. you would be better off going to Olive Garden.",

But this time, the garlic toast was so soggy and oily. They must have made them way ahead of time to be that bad.  The zucchini was also soggy and oily. Yuk.  We ordered the eggplant rollatini stuffed with seafood.  You had to hunt for the seafood and it was terribly heavily sauced.  We then ordered the ravioli with truffles.  No truffles to be seen, just a heavy cream truffle \"tasting sauce\"  We think they just used truffle oil.  That dish was $50.  A ripoff. Then we ordered the rack of lamb.  It was very tough and the mustardy gravy did not help, as it was also dumped onto the very uninteresting potatoes.  Our waiter, however, was so very nice and accomodating. Not his fault.  The captain sent us a dessert to make up for the bad food.  The dessert was delicious and the best thing we ate.  We will not go back as it was a very expensive dinner for not so good food.",

    "text": "It was a toss up between checking out Batali/Bastianich's B&B Ristorante at Palazzo and Il Molino at Forum Shops.  We chose Il Molino because we were turned off by B&B's menu of offal such as sweetbreads and lamb's brain.  There is no way my husband will eat oxtail, rabbit, wild boar, or duck liver.  Too authentic for us, I guess. But Il Molino ended up being a great choice.  The romantic classic dining room was warm and inviting.  When we were seated, tuxedo-clad waiters (more than one) promptly arrived to set down napkins and menus and carved chunks of aged parmesan from a giant wedge for all of us.  Additional starters included thinly sliced fried zucchini, sliced salame, beautiful rustic bread, outstanding bruschetta, and mussels - we didn't order any of these things.  It just came.  Our waiter spouted off a long list of specials and even brought a tray of langostines to the table to show that they were part of the specials.    We ordered veal rollatini with prosciutto and mozzarella, pappardelle bolognese, angel hair with tomato and garlic, lamb osso bucco with saffron risotto, chicken picatta, and fettucine alfredo.  Of course, we were all full from the appetizers by the time the giant-sized entrees arrived.  All of our dishes were very good but not outstanding or incredibly memorable.  The cuisine is classic Italian, so the menu, although it has terrific variety, isn't incredibly inventive.  However, seeing familiar dishes makes the food very accessible.  We ended with a dessert sampler which included pieces of tiramisu, molten chocolate cake, zabaglione with berries, and ricotta cheesecake.  Again, everything was great. In my opinion, what you pay for at Il Mulino is the stellar service.  Not sure if any cappellini pomodori or fettucine alfredo worth $26.",

Busboy was very nice though  Food: \"free\" appetizers were excellent. Dry cheese and a zucchini dish.  Main courses were not enjoyable at all...Shrimp al diablo and Canneloni. Portions were very large though..if only they tasted good :(   Price: Extremely overpriced  On our first trip to Vegas, this was our one really nice meal.  The place was recommended by a group of guys on our flight in who told us they went to Vegas once a year for the past 7 years.  We were extremely disappointed and felt robbed.  Perhaps it was our meal choices....  Would only go again if meal was free.",

Menu is hard to read: prices are in that curly font where 5s suspiciously can be mistaken for 3s! (\"My entree is $54 dollars! Damn! I thought it  was $34!) Service was also good, not great. (I love hispanic waiters pretending to be Italian...but then, who doesn't?)  Had to ask for menus three times. The decor is very nice: low-light, warm colors, dark wood. Did I mention that this restaurant is far too expensive?  There are better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. One that comes to mind rhymes with Schmalintino...also expensive, but almost worth it.",

Meals went through final stage of preparation near table, fun to watch. No feeling of being rushed although the room was jumping. Wish we had time for dessert, but had to head to a show.

    "text": "Alright, so I'm going to be completely honest here and say I worked here from 2008-2009 so I know the idiosyncrasy of this restaurant. I was a hostess and a bartender, and I really need to address a comment a reviewer made.  Seating: Just because you make a reservation on Open Table does not mean you are going to get an amazing table. Let me give you the gist of fine dining restaurants and table preferences, Il Mulino has a lot of very wealthy regular clientele that like to sit at certain tables just like most fine dining restaurants do. Just because a table is open currently, does not mean that it will be in 30 minutes or an hour. The average dining time at that restaurant is an hour and a half for a table of 2. Therefore, you can't get seated at a table you want if it has already been requested by another customer, especially if that customer was a regular. A reservation is a guaranteed seat in the restaurant, all table requests are as such, they are requests that can or cannot be accommodated at the maitre'd's discretion.  Anyhow, I haven't worked nor been to this restaurant in over  a year. I ended up walking in on Saturday evening with my date after our little adventures at the Bellagio and we had dinner here. To describe the restaurant a little, it's a gothic, romantic atmosphere with black iron chandeliers, plush red velvet curtains and dim lights. We got seated and enjoyed the sunset menu which was an an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. Upon sitting down we received the chilled sauteed zucchini which hasn't gotten any better since I worked there. It's drenched in oil and honestly just not that appealing. We also received some bruschetta and mussels, salami, a chunk of the huge (and my favorite) wheel of Parmesan cheese with a bread basket. All of that is complimentary before we even got our appetizer. I just had our captain order for us and he did an excellent job except for the appetizer, which was polenta and sausage. It was bland and salty. Our starting entree was a sampler of the mushroom ravioli which I died for. It's a porchini stuffed mushroom ravioli in a champagne black truffle cream sauce, yes it sounds amazing and it WAS. I so missed that. Following that, we had the main entree which was steak pizziola, sauteed spinach, and some amazing shrimp. I wish I remembered what they were called. They didn't have them when I worked there. We were so full but we still had to have the dessert which was PHENOMENAL. We had the tiramisu and finished off with some cappucinos. Oh no, just when you think it's over they brought over lemoncello and grappa. By the time we left, I felt like lying down and passing out. Everything I received in the restaurant was just the same as any other reservation regardless of me being a past employee, except for the double helping of free alcohol which is usually lemoncello or grappa and we got both. Honestly, i've dined at a  lot of restaurants and the customer service continues to be excellent and above par with a lot of other restaurants i've dined at. You might assume I'm just bias, but I think you can tell from my other reviews i'm a pretty honest person. Anyhow, if anyone wants amazing romantic Italian on the strip, this is your place.  P.S. I lived in NYC and both of the managers did as well. No the location is not the original in NYC, it's bigger and has more seating but most of the patrons said that it was comparable to the location in NYC :) So take that as you will, from New Yorkers.",

    "text": "My husband and I were eager to try Il mulino, unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations. We were in italy last summer and were hopeful that this would be True italian cuisine, but instead we got americanized mediocre italian food. We sat down and were greated with garlic bread and Parmesan cheese that was broken off of a large block of cheese. They then brought fried zucchini and another type of bread basket. Everything was overly drenched in olive oil. We ordered 1 glass of wine each which was very flavorful. For our main course I ordered chicken Parmesan which looked more like a flat pizza smothered with an excess amount of cheese. It lacked flavor and texture and the chicken was pounded so flat that it had no taste. My husband had the veal Parmesan that looked identical to my mess on the plate. It looked more like 2 frisbee's on our plates then meat. The food quality picked up with dessert. I had the tiramisu which was delicious and my husband had peanut butter ice cream coated in a hard chocolate shell, it was fabulous. We also had  cappuccino which was very tasty. We have traveled all over the world and have had some wonderful meals, but this does not make the list. The price did not justify the quality. For 2 people the bill was over $300.00 with tax and tip. If you want an outstanding, unforgettable meal in Las Vegas go to Gordon Ramsey steakhouse at Paris hotel or Otto ( italian food just like venice italy) In the palazzo by the canal.",

It is truly a dining experience.  Table 54 is my favorite spot in the dining room as you get a panoramic view of the entire restaurant.  There isn't even a need to order appetizers because they serve so many little appetizers, all included with your meal.  Amazing cheese, bread, etc.  Fantastic wine list and very knowledgable bartenders.  Everything I have had from here is amazing.  I always get a pasta dish with bolognese and it is consistently amazing.   I make it a point to try everything else that those I am with get.  Haven't ever been disappointed.

Reading about the crazy bottled-water charges, we simply avoided bottled water (duh... :) and went on to have one of the best meals of our lives!!   And thanks to the truly delicious food, I'm not even taking off a point for a few of the staffers who were a little on the bitchy side (many men wait on and service your table throughout the meal, it's those cocky, little pretty-boy ones who are a little much -- or, shall i say, a little lacking in their servicing skills).  Our actual waiter, however -- Fabio [ciao bello!!] -- was a consummate pro (making up for those bitchy weasels, luckily)....and was certain to look in on us throughout the evening -- a True charmer!  DO watch out though -- this food is soooooo delicious you may find that you overdo, so don't be afraid to split dishes.  WIth all the extras they bring for you, splitting will help not only with the bill (which will be high, but well worth it),  but with the ability to walk [vs. roll] out of the restaurant.  We'll definitely do a split-fest for next time (so that we can actually go OUT after dinner -- i mean, this IS vegas [baby]:).........we'll DEFINITELY be back !!!",

Wonderful roast potatoes, some of the best spinach I've ever had (sauteed with garlic), my friend had a divine salmon with what we all thought were some of the best mushrooms we've ever had... I could go on and on! I will also note, though. the beautiful simplicity of the lemon sorbet, frozen in a whole lemon: divine. And the best Affogato I'ver ever been served. All of the service was splendid. Our captain, Bali Kovary, was the best I've ever had. He is supreme. Give this place a try, ask for Bali, sit back and let them do their work.

    "text": "Our friends who live in Vegas wanted to take us to this upscale Italian restaurant, which they had experienced a few months earlier. When we arrived, we were impressed with the white tablecloths, the atmosphere, and the serving staff.   As soon as we sat down we were offered a chunk of cheese off the biggest wheel of parmesan I've ever seen.  It was very tasty and a nice touch to begin your meal.  After about five minutes, the server brought over bruscheta for each of us, but I found it overwhelmed with garlic, which took away from the tomato and basil tastes normally associated with this appetizer.  At this point, we hadn't even ordered our meals yet. Our friend wanted a wine that he had tasted on his previous visit, but it was no longer on their wine list. That was no problem, and the sommelier immediately turned up with exactly the wine we wanted. We were impressed!  Unfortunately that's where the great experience stopped. We each ordered something different and were surprised that everything was ala carte. I ordered chicken parmigiana and got one plate with a huge chicken breast covered in marinara. The parmesan cheese was sparse. White it tasted satisfactory, I was surprised that an Italian restaurant would serve any kind of parmigana without pasta to accompany it. To be honest, I can't even remember what everyone else ordered because all of our meals were pretty unmemorable. We were quite disappointed to have paid so much for so little.  This place is definitely classy, but for the price, I'd say you can find something much better somewhere else on the Strip.",

The minute we sat down The big hunk of Parmesan was sitting on the table and the captain started cutting pieces off for us.  Then the flood of food started pouring onto our tables.  It was awesome.  The fried zucchini, bruschetta + mussel.  Good nibbles before the real deal came.    The captain came over introduced himself and proceeded to give us the specials.  We all joked that we needed subtitles because he had a thick Italian accent and we had no clue what majority of the specials were.  We caught seabass, ravioli and veal hahaha.  It was a good time.    I ordered  the beef carpaccio for my appy:  Thinly sliced tuscan style beef served with arugula, olive oil and lemon.   After passing it around to everyone at the table for a taste, I had one bite left....it was a delicious last bite.    For my entree I had the mushroom ravioli. OMG DELICIOUS! I was so full by the time my entree came, but I forced fed myself because it was so good.  I also tried a bite of everyone else's to add to that. *ugh*  but it was all worth it.  On the table we had Ossobuco \"the manly dish\" lol (my friend Princess ordered this and the waiter looked at her wide-eyed and said wow, that's a manly dish) lol.  Lobster Ravioli, Sea bass, Lasagna, and Veal.  Every last dish was delicious.    Even with all this food we still found room for dessert.  Gelato, Tiramisu, flourless cake, and cheesecake.  HOLY CANOLI they were all good! The Cheesecake was the best cheesecake I've ever had.  The Flourless cake was awesome too.    Overall Food was great, service was great.  O I forgot the grappa was extremely strong, but apparently it's suppose to be like that.  Loved the restaurant, it IS quite pricy, but for me it's well worth the treat once in a while.",

Cesar salad is made to order and it has a great dressing.  I've had the veal Parmesan, which is a giant portion of tender veal topped with marina and cheese. It was amazing. Also tasted the special, which was lobster ravioli. Which was fantastic.  Great service.  A little expensive, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.",

He knew all the dishes and specials perfectly and our water, bread, was never empty. Had the caprese special and some eggplant/crab dish to start. Both were phenomenal. The mozzarella was soo fresh in the caprese. For main course, ordered the lobster ravioli and mushroom ravioli w/ truffle oil specials. Both were spectacular. I was so full I couldn't really appreciate my meal as much as I would have liked. Do not eat the bread! You'll regret it when your pasta comes. If you're looking for a great Italian meal in vegas, would highly recommend this place.",

It truly is a dining and culinary experience.  While Il Mulino is not a family style restaurant, everything was so good and unique that we turned it into one. We were sharing Grana Padano (cheese), bruschetta, garlic breads, country bread, focaccia, chicken Parmesan, veal, ravioli, shrimp fish and more.   A bit on the pricey side, but well worth the experience!",

The original is rather small and difficult to get a reservation. i always enjoyed the food there but never liked the cramped quarters and snooty attitude.  Basically, this is a clone foodwise of the NYC location but with all the things I didn't like about the NYC location improved upon. The food at the Las Vegas location is on a par with the NYC location but the attitude is gone.  Also, the restaurant is spacious.    Before you even have a chance to look at the menu, you are served large chunks of parmigianna cheese, chili soaked zucchini slices, various breads and other treats.  The menu selection is generally traditional and extensive.  Everything is well prepared and generously portioned.  My major complaint is that their wine list is a joke. The mark-ups are so high it is insulting.   If this was not typical for all the top end restaurants on the strip, I would have taken off a star for this alone.",

This Vegas impostor had 1 thing in common with it's NYC location.  Very high prices.  I should have known when I was able to get a last minute reservation for 6 on a Sat night.  The food was probably better then average but I held them to a higher standard.  Do not think this is what the downtown NY restaurant is like.  I would call this brand dilution and I hope they are making plenty of money because they sold their soul to do it.  Go to Rao's instead.  Also not as good as the original but a better representitive the \"ILL\" Mulino's",

The truffle mushroom ravioli is very good, and it is described as as \"special\" found on the menu. Both times, the waiter listed it as a \"special\", which leads me to my major problem with how management is running this restaurant. The waiter introduces him, and then begins listing off a thousand different entrees and dishes as \"specials\" not found on the menu. By the beard of Zeus, I can't recall this many items when deciding on dinner. Do the customer a service and put the items on a menu!!!   Other gripes:  - I inquired about a side of saucy potatoes that are served with the lamb chops. I wished to order these potatoes as a stand alone dish, but I was curtly informed that this was not possible. Dinner was served and the waiter surprisingly presented me a side of these potatoes with a wink of the eye. How nice of him, I thought. Later, the bill is presented and I see that I'm charged $12 for some chopped potatoes. GUY, AN EYE WINK WITHOUT DISCUSSION OF PRICE IMPLIES THE DAMN POTATOES ARE ON THE HOUSE.

For some odd reason, we didn't try Il Mulino sooner...we've been missing out on a great place. Who doesn't like a good Italian restaurant?  As soon as you get seated, a \"mob\" goes to your table offering you complimentary grana padano, spicy garlic bread, focacia, bruschetta, salami, sauteed zucchini, mussels and more bread. The garlic bread is oily? Who cares? It's delicious!  They have a lot of specials that aren't on the menu so your \"captain\" would have to recite the specials to you which could take up to 5 minutes - if you have a short attention span, you might be in trouble. Good thing I came here knowing what I already what I want. They cook their pasta to a perfect al dente.  Tortellini alla Panna: Meat tortellini, black truffle and peas in cream sauce. Excellent tortellini and the cream sauce was perfect and not thick. 5/5  Ravioli: Ravioli filled with mushrooms in champagne and black truffle sauce. The sauce is what makes this dish. It's creamy and truffle...and oh so yummy! I can eat this all day. 5/5  Tartufo: Half chocolate, half vanilla gelato enrobed in chocolate, served with whipped cream and zabaglione. I'm not a fan of whipped cream but zabaglione, I do like. The gelato has bits of cherries. Yum! 5/5  To end our meal, we were given complimentary grappa. It turned into a 2-hr dinner but it was wonderful.  If money is an issue, it can get pricey. It's about $60/person which includes entree, drink and dessert. But if think about it, after all the complimentary stuff we got and a fantastic meal, it was worth it.",

I opted for the stracciatella soup, which bought back fond childhood memories, and the arugula salad. The soup was good, but very salty and the salad was light and fresh.    This is a very old school restaurant, there was a small army of folks serving, very proper (in a good way!) and the room was classic elegance. It was a Friday night, but there were not many folks in the restaurant, which was too bad. They are located in the new section of the Forum Shops at Caesars. We really recommend Il Mulino - it's worth finding.",

Tonight the food and was just bad and the service, middling at best.   The usually delicious parmesan was not crumbly and deep in taste, but rather soft and bland. The zucchini, a soggy, oil laden mess.  My son ordered the mushroom and truffle ravioli as an appetizer and the sauce was think and bland. So disappointing. His veal chop, which was the special and well cooked, was really just bland.  At $75 for the chop, I would have expected a bit of flavor.   My dinner was sent back. I ordered pappardelle bolognese, which the captain highly recommended and mentioned was the most popular pasta dish. The dish was a bowl full of pink sauce with clump of overcooked broken pasta. There was not a single ribbon of pasta in the bowl. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he was very apologetic and noted that if they are \"too rough\" with the pasta in the kitchen, all the ribbons get broken. Really?? At the price they charge for pasta, I think it would be fair to have someone check the dish before it is served. They replaced this mess with linguini with clam sauce that was so over salted and spicy it was basically inedible.   Service was somewhat attentive, but there was a stream of different servers all night. I never saw the captain who took our ordered again nor did the same person ever deliver more than one dish.   So sad to see such a great restaurant fall to this level. You have certainly lost a customer. I am sure I am not the first.",

It was just like sitting in my mother in-laws dining room eating a homemade dinner with fine Italian wine.   We started off with the aged Parmesan cheese wedge with olives and prosciutto followed by a few appetizers (sorry can't remember them), and then the main course. My husband and I ate the chicken Parmesan and the truffle raviolis. Both were very good. For dessert the group tried a little bit of everything (choose the tiramisu) and we finished with limoncello and espresso. Overall, the group loved the cheese and the wine the best but still very much enjoyed their dishes.  For anything, go here for the authentic and old world, not rushed experience. Vegas lacks that feel and this place delivers. The wait staff was probably the best I've ever had in Vegas as well.",

    "text": "This really is a classy, old school-Vegas fine dining experience. The service was fantastic and attentive. We loved the antipasto, which included a hunk of the best Parmesan cheese we had ever tasted, a selection of bread, a zucchini dish, and salami. One person had Caesar salad for an appetizer and another had lentil soup--both loved these dishes. For the main course, we had the sea bass special, the gnocchi with pesto special, and the Capellini all' Arrabbiata. All of the food was wonderful and the staff was great about adjusting dishes for dietary restrictions and preference. The experience was great and not rushed at all, but something was missing for me just a bit. I think that might be due to be fact that there was a semi-limited number of vegetarian options and that Italian food without meat is going to be quite simple. Although we enjoyed our meal, we likely will not return when we chose to splurge on a meal in Vegas. One thing to also be aware of is that there are two separate lines on the bill for the tip--one for the captain's tip and one for the tip for the rest of the staff. That division just threw us off guard.",

It was superb! The service,ambience and food was second to none. We parked in valet, tip only, steps from the escalator and were there in no time. We were quickly greeted professionally, seated at a beautiful table and were treated like royalty. Even the bread was like nothing we've ever had. Daniel was our \"captain\" and was the epitome of promptness and attention to detail. The portion was pleasing and delicious. We will definitely go to Mulino again!",

They use to serve an amazing combination of complementary appetizers.  They no longer serve salami with the cheese, bread and bruschetta.  Greg the waiter said they got it from a local who no longer makes it so they no longer serve salami.  Another waiter said it was cut to bring down costs. A third waiter said he had no idea what happened.  Tension between the waiters and the manager was obvious.  Something was going on which was upsetting the waiters...   we order four different dishes and a couple of appetizers for a party of four.  The speciality appetizer of crab with egg plant use to be amazing with large pieces of crab. This visit it was mostly breading.  One dish was sooooo salty it had to be sent back.  Over all it was ok but not the usual amazing experience.  We worried the restaurant may be closing?  It is a little out of the way but in the past it was worth your time as the food and waiters were outstanding. We went on a Monday night so maybe it was just an off night?  I hope this is the case because many people would miss this restaurant if they closed.",

I was amused by the big ass block of cheese they put on the table. The cheese and the other complimentary appetizers were really good. I don't remember what I had because I was really drunk at the end of the dinner but I remember I liked it very much. It was some kind of pasta with red sauce.   When my husband popped the question, busted out the ring, and I said yes, a few  waiters (like 5 or 6) came out of the the kitchen and brought a big jar of limoncello. It was complimentary and all of them had a toast with us. That was so freakin cool! What's even more awesome is that every time a waiter passed by our table, they would have a shot of limoncello with us. It was surely a fun memorable night!",

If you are like me you'll notice there are a lot of five star reviews for this eatery... and a smattering of somewhat scathing reviews.  After experiencing Il Mulino for myself  - I  re scanned the reviews for my own edification - to better understand what the two-star-and-below crowd could have possibly been pissed about this place.   After reading their complaints, I happened to notice the percentage of \"bad\" reviews in the mix roughly mirrors the average percentage of those among us in society who are, sadly, diagnosed as having a mental illness.  So if I were you, listen to the glass half full gang on this one.   I could go on and on about why I believe this place deserves high acclaim.   Service was impeccable...they held our table for us during prime time on a Saturday night cheerfully while we tracked down a drunken poker renegade in our party. Then it was game on - It was flight of the server bumblebees the whole meal. Never waiting, never lacking. Yet we weren't smothered. Il mulino, you are the perfect girlfriend.   The ambiance was elegant and intimate without being pretentious. The food...well... You can't go wrong. From apps to the ridiculous tiramisu - made and served to you with a commitment to food excellence.  We will be back.",

    "text": "I went to Il Mulino on Veteran's Day, which is also my Birthday. Things started out pretty rough. I went by the restaurant for a recon two days prior to see if it lived up to its reputation for atmosphere and decor (it did). I also took this opportunity to ask one of the waiters questions that I did not want to ask at the table in front of my guests, which was beneficial. But when I told the girl I wanted a reservation for 4 on Veteran's Day, she said she didn't know when Veteran's Day was. To say I was not pleased is an understatement; I went from 0 to 60 in about 2 seconds. But my wife hit me and told me not to make a scene and make the reservation. I am glad she hit me and I'm glad I made the reservation.  The meal was one of the best I have ever had. Service was impeccable, staff was friendly and the Captain made us feel at home. We ordered some of the specials and some off the menu. It should be noted that Mulino's has what I assume is a pretty set group of specials they offer every night, which are not on the menu. They don't tell you the prices unless you ask, which can be embarrassing. All are a little pricy, but not out of line.   We had an eggplant and crab dish for appetizer along with some buffalo cheese, Italian meat and tomatoes. Both were delicious. The two ladies each had a fish dish, one was a fish cooked in rock salt, the other I forget. The men both had meat. My friend a steak (that you could cut with a fork) and I had a chicken dish. All were delicious. They gave me a special dessert for free because of my birthday.  One of the most impressive things about the restaurant - or at least  about our Service Captain (Raul') ,- is that he stopped us from ordering too much food. He could have easily made another $125.00 had he said nothing and just let us order. But it would have been WAY too much food. And he told us that. He even recommended we split the side dishes.  One thing to be careful of.....Italians have an after dinner aperitif that they will tell you \"cleanses you digestive system.\"  Well, it cleanses a LOT more than that. Baby, that is one STRONG DRINK. I had one made out of pears; I mean after all, how strong could something made out of pears be??? I forget what everyone else had. Then Raul' insisted I have some Italian brandy (or something) he brought around in a copper tub. He called in \"Italian Moonshine\" and that it was \"special\" and was free to me because of Veteran's Day.  DEAR GOD!!! I could barely find the door!!!  A wonderful night. Great food made even better by a great staff.  NOTE: The bill comes with two places to leave a tip, which I had never seen before. One place is for the \"Captain\" and the other is for \"Service.\" They don't tell you what to do unless you ask, which is embarrassing. But the \"Service\" tip is where you give your standard \"tip\" of whatever you want to give. The \"Captain\" tip is an extra amount that just goes to the table captain for outstanding service.  So if you do it like you are supposed to, your total tip could be as much as 30% of your meal cost. It's up to you.",

For 50 bucks a person that should not be the case. The food tasted like that one good Italian restaurant you enjoy any city USA (except 5 times the cost). We ordered a side of potatoes for 15 dollars and what we got looked like a serving of homestyle potatoes you get at say a Dennys. The service was impeccable but should be considering there is a captain who also expects to be tipped (FYI there is literally a line for the captains tip!). Don't know if that is a New York thing but I have never come across that and I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants. Save your money, way too many options on the strip to bother dining here.",

The food is exceptional classic Italian-American fare, and they plow you full of free appetizers before even thinking of handing you a menu. You pay for the service and the food, but it's worth it.

We were told that the service would blow our minds and Il Mulino did not disappoint. The captains and all the servers were checking up on us constantly and all the recommendations were great.  We had a party of 8 and we almost got full off the house appetizers. We made it party style and ordered the branzino, pounded veal chop, mushrooms, shrimp with risotto, and the sea scallops. Our captain advised us that the portions were large and that we should start with these 4 dishes (we actually did get full off the 4 dishes!) The wine recommendation paired well with the food. As testament to their service, 3 servers took each dish and split them for us in our room.  If you're looking for great food and great service, check out Il Mulino!",

I love the zucchini, parmesan, bruschetta but then after that things just get so average and slightly overpriced. Yes it is impressive that the waiter can rattle off 15 specials but at the same time why not just add them to a menu as it's hard to remember and know which ones sound good and their price. I've had 6 different dishes here over 3 visits and all are very average, the first time I was wowed by the appetizers and still think they are excellent but it's stopped making me love this place. Also, the lunch crowd is very small which means service this time wasn't great as the servers weren't overly interested and there weren't many of them.",

Unfortunately, we were still a bit worse for wear from the day before, so dinner had to be a bit lighter than we probably would have done otherwise. We were amazed at the number of free nibbles they hand out: three types of bread, a hunk of aged parmesan, bruschetta, a mussel and fried zucchini. They were all really well done, but it does fill you up a bit at the beginning. They also don't do corkage, so the bottle of wine we brought from Santa Cruz had to be held on to to have when we got back to the hotel.  To start, I had the fresh buffalo mozzarella with red and yellow tomatoes and the other half ordered the langoustine starter. For mains, we both ordered a porcini and truffle ravioli that was on special. The starters were great. The cheese was really fresh (I assume it's made in house) and the tomatoes and asparagus it was served with just went great. The langoustines were perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The mains were also really tasty, but the other half couldn't finish his. We skipped dessert as we were both really full, and nothing really jumped out at us (they have very traditional Italian desserts).  All in all the food was great and the service was outstanding. The ravioli ended up being incredibly expensive, so if I could do 4.5 stars I would. Although it's not more than we've paid for meals at other places and the delicious pre-starters really made up for it. They also have a decent wine list and decant the wines into pitchers which made for interesting conversation. It's a pretty solid place for a great Italian meal in Vegas (although it definitely seemed more like Italian food I've had in the US than Italian food in Italy).",

The moment we were seated, we were treated to mouthwatering starters--including parmesan cheese, slices of salami and marinated zucchini.  We ordered cocktails and began perusing the menu.  Oy vey!  So many choices and so little time!  I started with a traditional Caesar salad which was delicious.  The waiter said the dressing is made fresh in the kitchen and it was splendid.  My second course was Pasta of the Day with Bolognese sauce; it melted in my mouth.  My main course was Osso Buco which you could cut with fork.  Wanting to pretend I was eating healthy, I substituted the risotto with spinach--sauteed to perfection in garlic and olive oil.  Dessert was a scoop of chocolate and vanilla gelato that made my eyes roll back into my head.  We completed the meal with a complimentary grappa and then had to be carried out of the restaurant.  Il Mulino is our idea of food heaven.  We cannot wait to go back and try some other dishes.",

    "text": "In short, YUM. Went here while in Vegas recently with Lauren B. It came at the high recommendation of someone else and their kudos were well deserved!   Arrive hungry as this place brings you lots of food even before you order. The service was amazing with a full team paying attention to our table including the captain (which became confusing at tip time as there was a separate line for tip and captain tip, which we weren't quite sure how to handle)!  Upon seating, a large 20+ pound carcass of Parmesan cheese was brought to the table and we were each given a heaping scrape from it. Then, we received a small plate of meat, bread options (go for the buttery looking one - you won't regret it at least in the moment!) and crispy zucchini. We ordered the special Burratta as well, which they split into two plates for us. The Burratta was amazing as were the other items we had to start. I opted for the special Pappardelle alla Bolognese as I rarely turn down a homemade Pappardelle or Bolognese sauce. It was amazing. Seriously great taste and a heaping portion. We enjoyed some wine with our meal as well - a nice Italian Chianti. We were both so full we couldn't even consider dessert, but they will bring you some grappa to the table as a post-dinner treat.   Make a reservation - definitely a popular place and worth planning ahead to go there. Just be sure you are ready to mangia!",

I highly recommend El Molino because of it's personalized service and excellent food quality. It has great collection it has an excellent collection of wine.   If you're only going to eat at the restaurant and not go to the shops I will recommend that the best way to get into restaurant is from the front entrance of the Caesars forum shops if you enter the form shops from the casino side you need to walk a bit long to get to this place well worth the walk either way.   The atmosphere was very good I think the food was amazing and the staff was very attentive especially Denis but be careful with the one price the price in generally I think more expensive than normally but it's worth just make sure you know the price before you order you'll be surprised that even the water is charge on the bill.",

    "text": "Honestly, for all those following my reviews in Yelp, will be used to my 'straight to the point' and 'I don't rate service as people comes and goes' kind of policy when I rate a place. In this case, I will have to do a little bit of history, so I will break my 'straight to the point' policy. As Italians, my family and me use to dine a lot at IL MULINO, especially the one in NYC. We also used to come a lot to the Vegas one, and in our last 3 or 4 times, we had a superb service and food.  I will have to start my review this time by praising the service at this place, what I found it did not decline even a little bit (hence the 3 stars). Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing about the food. Let's start with the fact, we are still on vacation time (beginning of August) and even if the shopping mall is full of people this restaurant was not as busy. I remember other times where reservations were a must and even with them you had to wait (sometimes over an hour) to get your table. That should give me a hint of what was going on (I have to clarify, my last visit to IL MULINO in Vegas was in 2014).  Let's start with the wine list. It is way shorter than I remember and, guys, did you jack up the prices in it !! As a fan of Malbec, I asked for one bottle of the 2 they have in the list (being an Italian restaurant and you have only 2 selections of Argentinian Malbec, a country founded by Italians, pretty much, is kind of unacceptable). To my surprise, they were out of them (really?). I order a barbaresco instead. Guys, that bottle in the stores costs about 55 bucks, wholesale I adventure, around $25 (normally markup is about 300%). Pricing the bottle at $380 is kind of ridiculous, anyway, I ordered it. Now we comes to the menu. It is the typical 2 pages (it always has been), but then the waiter came with about 10 different specials for the night. Ok, guys, can anyone of you tell me how can we remember 10 different plates by hard when we want to decide on our order? What about printing a small card with all those 'specials' for the day guys? Just an idea. We were 4 in the party that night. We have a sea bass (full sea bass fish just oven roasted with salt), which I have to add a side of roasted broccoli myself (at a charge of course), we also ordered Spaghetti Arrabiata, truffled risotto and spaghetti vongole. Traditionally the Vongole sauce is made with Cockle not with Clams, but we can overlook that, as they are both in the same 'family'. Sill the taste is not the same. The truffled risotto, was creamy (which the menu did not say) and also cooked thoroughly, unfortunately the person eating it likes the rice 'al dente'. The spaghetti Arrabiata was good and super hot (as in the opposite of cold), so I suggest you take your time letting it cool down a bit. The person who ate the risotto, was fascinated with the taste of the truffles, but not impressed with the plate in a whole (and we are talking about an Italian mamma, who knows how to cook, capisce?). We finish our plates, I ordered and espresso and asked or the bill. Since it was someone's birthday, the manager sent us a small chocolate cake plate with whipped cream as a birthday cake which happened to be, probably, THE BEST PLATE we had in the entire night. We just munched it all in less than 2 minutes. Ok, guys, don't get astonished when you see the bill in this place. All that above, plus a couple of Pellegrino water bottles, plus tax and service charge (mandatory and added to your bill), was almost $700. Yes, you read right, almost seven hundred dollars. As I mention in all my reviews, since I know it is an expensive place, I do not complain about the price. If I cannot afford it, I won't sit down to eat there. But if I am paying big bucks, I want big 'returns' for it. I did not get that at IL Mulino, in Vegas at all.  Recommend the place? Yes. I will recommend it, but I will say, stay away from the wine list (if you can, order by the glass which are more decently priced) and stay away from elaborated plates, stick to the italian classics, the pasta. Cheers.",

The start of the meal was great, had the cheese starter and all the other small plates that came were nice. My mother ordered a cocktail and I got a glass of wine, and that was the last time we were ever offered a drink for our meal. Dinner started at 6:30 we left around 8:45, so during the whole course of time our waiter never asked either of us if he could refill our drinks. By the way, they have so many people working in this place, every other person besides our waiter came to our table, like I have no clue who our waiter actually was, I know there are bus boys, runners blah blah blah, but where the F is our waiter?...Any way, parents both got the burrata salad and they didn't like it much. I started with the oysters, which were fresh and nice, but they weren't shucked properly, so I had to use my tiny fork to get them free. I had the salmon as my entree, it was moist and lovely, so A+ there. My mom's veal chop was perfect, where as dad's was mostly fat, but the side potatoes were fabulous. So long story, not so short, pretty good food, crap service, I still want another drink btw, but I'll go back for another try.",

    "text": "Before a show at the Colosseum at Caesars, I came here for an early dinner.  Opening promptly at 5 PM, I was seated and soon a bevy of servers brought a number of different starters to the table.  First, a large wheel of Grana Padano cheese and gouged a chunk out and placed it on a small plate.  Then came Italian bread, focaccia, garlic bread, sauteed zucchini, and bruschetta with one mussel.  This before any menu was offered.  It was almost overwhelming that items kept being brought to the table.  The captain then told me the specials for the night without price information and he left me with a menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon brought and was kept refilled during my dinner.  When the captain came back, I ordered the Stracciatella alla Fiorentina soup, sometimes referred to as Italy's egg drop soup.  For the main course, I got the porcini mushroom stuffed ravioli in and black truffle and champagne sauce.  The soup was very good and very hot.  With the choice of breads I had been brought, there was a wide variety to go with the soup.  A bus person grated cheese and ground fresh pepper for the soup.  The white of the eggs were evident all over the top of  the soup.  Very nice.  The ravioli was good.  Again I was offered freshly ground cheese and cracked pepper and I chose both.  The ravioli were good but the mushroom taste didn't make it.  The pillows were unevenly stuffed and the flavor came from the delicious sauce.    For dessert, I got panna cotta with orange sauce and very thin rind.  It was a light ending to a heavy meal with all the bread and the number of ravioli that were served.  For the most part, service was good.  However, for a restaurant of this caliber, I would expect them to patrol the table a bit more and remove used sugar substitute packets.  This is one of my tests for the best of service from a high end spot.  The dinner was good, but Il Mulino is certainly charging Strip prices and there are better Italian restaurants on the Strip.",

    "text": "The food and service here are both excellent. The servers are nice and very helpful. We were seeing a show at the Coliseum at 8 pm so they made sure to pace our meal accordingly, so we'd be out with plenty of time to walk over.  The desserts were amazing, especially the cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake. The cheesecake was the best I've had.  They are also generous with small bites before your meal - Parmesan cheese, bruschetta, fried zucchini, etc.  The reason I didn't give it more stars is because we brought in a bottle of champagne that we'd been drinking on the way over from our hotel room (in Caesars), which had been a birthday gift for our friend. We just wanted to finish it before eating, since he had no way to save it and it was a nice champagne.   The servers kindly offered to put it on ice for us - and then the manager came over to let us know it was a problem. She lectured us for a few minutes and then we got a $50 corkage fee on our bill.   Meanwhile, we ordered apps, entrees, desserts and a bottle of wine, so the bill came to almost $600 without tip. We also were all staying at Caesars, and were seeing a show there (she asked, so she knew).   It just left a bad taste in our mouths to have our lovely evening marred by the manager's making a big deal out of something so minor and then adding a pretty ridiculous charge to our already substantial bill.   It's unfortunate because we'd probably all be recommending this restaurant to friends when in Vegas, but that incident made us all feel we wouldn't want to return.",

It started really well, good service, a very nice Captain, the appetizers were great, my husband loves pasta and I asked the Captain for his recommendation ... he told me, and I quote, \"the chicken parmesan is the best I've ever had\" ... being a fairly good cook myself and that being one of my specialties .. I took his recommendation.   My husbands dish (spaghetti & meat balls) was good, not wonderful, our salads were ok, wine was ok, but my dish was just AWFUL, I could not eat it, it was tough, overcooked and drowning in too much cheese. I nibbled around the edges but could not eat it, literally.  I sat for the longest time, waiting for the waiter to come, he never did .. when he did finally come by to pick up our plates, I told him it was not good and I could not eat it. Expecting at the very least to have him offer to bring me something else or remove it from our bill ... BUT, nothing. I was stunned.   They brought my husband a desert sampler and even sang \"Happy Birthday\" in Italian, which was thoughtful, but sorry, I was ready to cry ...   As I said, I had such high hopes ... I don't understand why the Captain was so dishonest, it's as if the cook screwed up and someone said, \"push the chicken parmesan\"  .. if it had not been for this truly awful dish the dinner would have been fairly successful.",

We had a party of 12 and they were able to accommodate us last minute since our reservation at a prior restaurant had mysteriously disappeared.   We sat down and the wait staff was very nice. Our server did make us comfortable while taking our time to order and asking if we would prefer a different pasta. That was a plus. The only thing I would recommend for the restaurant is to not have so many specials. The server basically read us the whole secret menu because the other items that were not on special was posted on the regular menu. Too much to absorb.  I had a great time, but I probably wouldn't come back unless I was craving Italian food in Las Vegas.",

I loved the Parmesan cheese chunks served with warm bread. Just to warn you though, portions are huge!  I'll know next time to share the main course, or order family style.

The Parmesan chunks, the excellent breads, the paper thin zucchini and mushrooms with delicious olive oil (that in itself would make a meal and are all brought to you while you decide on what you want for dinner at no extra charge).  The wine list is amazing and in a leather bound book. (They had wines for as little as $80 and as high as $29,000.  Yep it is no typo 29K for a bottle.) All the pasta is fresh, ravioli amazing, appetizers are diverse and delicious.  Everyone at the table enjoyed different items from Gnocchi to Mediterranean Sea Bass and all were amazing.  The food kept coming for over 3 hours and by the end we were too stuffed to even contemplate dessert.  If you win BIG in Vegas and are looking for an experience that will be remembered, then set aside about $400-$800 for dinner here and enjoy.",

    "text": "If you love Italian food and you're in Vegas, do not miss this restaurant!  I know it's hard to justify a 10,000 calorie meal when you're planning on hitting the pool the next day, but isn't decadence part of why we go to Vegas?  To spoil ourselves a bit?  If you haven't been to Il Mulino before here's my advice: skip lunch, grab a date, wear something not-too-tight, and show up ready for some serious, fabulous carbs.  Beware that the assortment of free munchies comes out before they even deliver the menu, so it's easy to get overly-enthusiastic about the fried zucchini, garlic bread, parmesan chunks, bruschetta, and spicy toasts and fill up on those.  Delicious as they are, it's worth it to save room for the ravioli.  Personally, my better half and I split a Caesar salad (an attempt to throw a vegetable into the mix), then split an order of the ravioli (which is always a \"special\" and not listed on the menu), then he gets the chicken parm, and we finish off with a dessert of berries and cold zabaglione.  It's a meal worth savoring, so take your time and enjoy.  You deserve it after losing all that money in the casino.  ;)  A note about the staff - they are always amazing and incredibly attentive.  And a note about cost - I believe the ravioli dish is $50 per order, which seems crazy, but if you split it and factor in all the freebies you ate the minute you sat down, it doesn't seem as bad.  Make an evening of it (particularly a romantic one), and it will be worth every cent.",

I couldn't stop eating the fresh goodness that was coming out of your kitchen! I was in love with your food!    You can imagine my surprise at my first visit to your sister resto here in Las Vegas -- yes, the waiter's memorization of the entire menu plus specials was impressive... but the splendor stopped until we got to the desserts and lemoncello. The trio of  house-favorite pastes that our table ordered to share came out like mush... and didn't go down well either.  The pesto sauce coating the gnocchi was flavorless (albeit extremely green), and the red sauce for the other paste course was also bland.  Well, the salted branzino will be the star of the show, I thought to myself.... but, I was (sadly) disappointed.  The fish was entirely too dry.... so that I was wishing I wasn't so quick to reject the scorned paste.    Yes, I'l Mulino Las Vegas, your dessert (especially the tiramisu) is spectacular, as are your servers... but I do not think I can visit you again until you take some lessons from your East coast sister.",

After eating at some other restaurants, including another \"Italian\" place, we decided this was easily the best meal we had in LV.  As other people mentioned, the staff brings you several mini appetizers to start. They are all traditional Italian preparations. Nothing flashy, but simple ingredients and well executed prep make them shine. We went to Italy for 3 weeks last year, and I would say that the food here reminded us of the real stuff.  I had the double cut veal chop that was on special. It was delicious. My wife had a combo of two different pasta dishes which the server was happy to assemble for her by halving two entrees. (I do wish he had mentioned the slight up charge for doing this. It was $2, but it's the principle that matters.) This made her very happy, and the portions were quite large. Service was well-paced and the \"captain\" did as good a job as one could expect. After asking him to repeat the specials a second time, and then asking him what he would recommend, I feel he certainly did us justice. As far as tipping goes... I have never seen a separate line for the captain's tip. So, I simply ignored it. No big deal. This was a very nice dining experience, and we would go back again.",

Many of the specials are the same, (though, perhaps Its because I find myself in Vegas at the beginning and end of summer, more than any other season, so perhaps its just dependent on what's in season... That's a fair thought, right?)  I have genuinely enjoyed every meal that I've had here, and typically shove too much food in my face.  It's all very flavorful.  The complaint that I would have with this place, is that their wine menu is stupid expensive... Their mark-up on them is astronomical... Probably 500%+, But, I can accept that, getting hunks of parm, bruschetta, zuccini, mussels, grappa, a selection of breads, salamis, and whatever else I may be forgetting, as compliments of the house.

The bill was only $400 for two so I'm not doing the high roller thing but I expect some decent treatment.  bring us the salad why we look at the menu.  No?  You can't?  The chef doesn't allow that?  What?  No?  Are you kidding?  The salad came.    Take the tired apps you sent out.  Yes they're free but they lack any assemblance of special.   This was an aggravating dinner when I should have been able to just keep my hands under the table without worry.  Super Tuscan was good but I guess they wanted me to apologize I only dropped $175 when anyone worth their salt would have went for the other bad selections at triple the price.  I know wine. I know it costs, but this wine list is so out of touch.  Great, it's expensive with lots of overpriced stuff.  Once a list like this establishes itself as expensive they think they can go off the chart and get double what other expensive lists get.  Romance the pouring of the wine.  \"We will jam 10 ounces each of wine in your glass and we know you'll buy another. \" Please you freaken idiot.  I ordered a bottle of water to quench and hydrate.    Caesar was OK.  Lamb dish the babe had was off the chart she said.  The pasta with seafood I had was so bland and so tasteless and so ugly, that I actually asked for lots of Cheese.  i figured I was drunk and I need to eat.    yes, I think we should all be tough on Il Mulino.  They charge big, live on a stellar reputation.  They are not Olive Garden.  But truthfully the babe digs Olive Garden more.  Easy uncomplicated, what you expect.  Just give me what i expect and don't make me work for it.  No big deal.",

    "text": "Delish as usual!  Flavors, herbs, spices even olive oil, really stand out in the food here.  The shrimp taste you are eating here is shrimp, not 'fishy\". Most likely one has been eating flavorless shrimp that has been freezer burned. Or washed in lord knows what to extend the life of the food not its flavor.   We are foodies, we notice things like this. We like to pay for a good meal, money is almost never an issue for us when it comes to dining out. I almost regularly seeing the bad reviews as a money issue. Not everyone likes to pay for a gourmet meal.  To each his own.  The other thing I notice is classless behavior on the part of the reviewer. Really, that's how you act in a nice restaurant? This isn't a Hooters.  . Guess I could of got bent out of shape with the following issues. Why would I do that, they are just small hick ups in life.  I don't go through life thinking people are just trying to F* with me.     Didn't like pushing bottled water. Used to be done quiet often at strip restaurants. Most have quit doing it. The local water is horrible. Trust me they are filtering it. Without doing that, food would not look as good. Cooked greens would look icky. Never mInd, the mall would be replacing water pipes as the build up of metals in the water would eventually ruin the pipes & they'd break.  I asked for a Pommery champagne. The server came with another brand, half empty. saying this was what was being served by the glass. Recognize this as a very expensive brand.  We were first table seated right after opening for dinner. So that bottle was either opened at lunch or the night before. Said sorry not interested. Manager - might want to stop thinking your customers are stupid & that we'll just  'go along.'     I ordered an appetizer size of the prawns. Stated it a couple times, waiter stated it too.  Brought me the dinner size. I can't eat that much & These prawns would not taste good next day.  Sent it back, no big drama.   Hubs says 'oh you gotta be on your toes when you eat here.'  I agree but the food is so dang good I'll put up with it.  IF the food wasn't good, it'd be a different story.    Life is about balance.",

However, I gotta admit, everything was a little overpriced and I just couldn't get over how salty some of the dishes were. I did thoroughly enjoy my beef and veal fettucini dish, but my dad hated his cannoli (which was apparently doused in salt) and my mom couldn't really eat her tortellini.   The meal started out very well, with a server hoisting a huge wheel of parmesan cheese, along with complimentary fried zucchinis, salumi, bruschetta, bread and mussels. I have to say the zucchinis were a little too salty for my taste and the mussels didn't taste fresh at all, but the bruschetta and salumi were very good, as was the artisan bread.   Wine list was extensive and quite an eye opener.   I wish I had tried their tiramasu, but maybe there'll be a next time?",

The service was attentive without being overbearing.  The waiters took care of us without ever interrupting conversations and only made themselves known when we needed them.   Before I even had a chance to put my purse down they set a GIANT hunk of cheese in front of me and started carving it out.  They also brought out salomi and delicious crusty bread.  All complimentary of course!    The appetizers and main courses were delicious and we finished every bite!  The cocktails were well portioned and you didn't feel like your martini wasn't stiff enough.    They even brought out an after dinner drink - Digest-if to round out meal. Not sure what the check looked like (it is Vegas afterall!) but I'm sure it was worth every penny!  Will definitely be back to this place!",

We started with the parpadelle with ragu  and the clams casino (although they don't call them that on the menu).  The pasta was awesome but the clams were a bit small and had too much breading on them.    For the main course I had the Veal Milanese which is my go-to-meal provided it is on the bone and not cutlets.  It was one of the best I have ever had.  Huge portion, perfectly breaded and fried.  I ate 2/3rds and then my wife had some.  My wife had the Salted Branzino which was moist and excellent.  She said it was one of the best fish dishes she ever had.  We ordered a beautiful bottle of Italian white wine but it was advertised as an 2008 and they brought out a 2010.  It was still excellent, but I am always surprised at how many restaurants advertise one vintage and then bring out another.  In this case it really didn't make much different, but it just goes to show that you should always read the label.  Given the portion sizes along with the free apps (cheese, fried zucchini, etc.) you have to pace yourself or you can easily get filled up before your main course arrives.  Yes, it was expensive, but meals like this are always pricey, but, hopefully, worth it.  It was a great experience and you will not be disappointed.",

The appetizers were below average - salty bruschetta that was prepped too early because the bread was soggy.  The generous cheese was tasty though.  $40 for seafood risotto that was salty, risotto was clumpy, and seafood was a bit rubbery.  We ordered an Amarone we've had before - overpriced and warm (really???  Not even room temp.  Sad.)  Better $$ at Otto for the same wine.  I'm giving it three stars because my husbands fish was better than the risotto.  Not great, but not bad.  Certainly not worth the $$$$.",

    "text": "Had a very good lunch at Il Mulino on a Thursday.  We had a reservation for 1:00 and there was only one other party in the restaurant, which is criminal, because this place is solid.  As other Yelpers note, they bring you a load of gratis appetizers:  parmesan chunks taken directly off a massive wheel, salami, a bread basket, probably the best zucchini I've ever had (dried and served with hot peppers and garlic), and garlic toast.  They gave us a ton of the zucchini too.  Of the breads, the spicy toast was my favorite, but the garlic toast was a very close second.  You could have bought a bottle of wine and just had a great lunch with all the stuff they bring you as soon as you sit down.  Speaking of wine, Il Mulino has an above average list with prices you would expect for a restaurant on the Strip.  So, not cheap, and no real deals to be found.  But, they are not out of line with other Italian joints on the Strip.  Italy is heavily featured, as it should be.   Even though we had all of the free stuff mentioned above, we decided on the calamari as an appetizer.  Very classic, fried crispy with no greasiness whatsoever and served with a nice tomato sauce.  This was not revolutionary or a departure in any way from traditional fried calamari, but a really strong example of what the dish can be.  For our entrees, we all went with specials.  I had the lobster ravioli, and my 2 companions had eggplant parm stuffed with crab and sausage and pappardelle with bolognese.  My preference was the ravioli, the eggplant, and the bolognese pasta.  Nothing was bad mind you, it was all very good pasta, but that is the order of my preferences.  The ravioli was stuffed full of lobster and the flavor came through.  It had sort of a pinkish sauce that was seasoned very well.  All of the pasta was cooked properly.  Service was great.  It was a bummer for the restaurant that it wasn't busier, but it was great for us since we basically had a waiter to ourselves for nearly 2 hours.  Had a couple of bottles of wine and it was a very good meal, better than I was expecting given some of the reviews I'd read prior to dining.  I would absolutely return.",

My husband loved the octopus appetizer. Best thing of all was the thin crouton like bread that came with the complimentary appetizer, so ask for two of those! We shared a dessert sampler and that was a fun way to go. Everything was delicious and the service was very attentive. Glad this restaurant is one of our host's favorite places to dine.   Classy ambiance and very good food. Our companions are regulars there and our group had many dishes including appetizers, soup, salad, pasta, fish, and chicken. All were delicious. Dessert was the stand out - a fruit plate prepared table side. Oranges were sectioned and fruit was complimented by a bit of Grand Marnier.  The reason I didn't give five stars was that my chair was in a very uncomfortable spot. We were at a round table and I was stuck between a pillar and the table so the servers couldn't reach the person to my right except by serving over me. There was no simple way to fix this problem for me as it was our host's favorite table. I just endured which put a tarnish on an otherwise lovely experience.",

For dinner I had the chicken scarpillo which was superb. Paulie had the papadelle bolganaise and Frankie had the special ravioli a mushroom truffle.

From the moment you walk in the door, you feel special, welcome, and completely catered to every step of the way.  The evening starts off with choice of water (sparkling or still) and offers of drinks. While settling in and looking over the menu, we were brought a chunk of rich parmesan (cut off the huge slab at the table) crusty fresh bread, and sauteed mushrooms.   Some in our group ordered appetizers (the mushroom ravioli was fabulous). I ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad. It came with a huge chunk of soft, creamy cheese atop thinly sliced heirloom tomatoes over a bed of fresh greens. All was drizzled with a rich Balsamic Vinegar dressing. It would have been a perfect meal by itself. For my main dish I had the Sole Meuniere with a side of asparagus. The beurre-blanc was light with just the right balance of lemon to enhance the delicate fish, but not to overwhelm it. The fish was cooked to perfection and filleted table side. Yes, I had dessert. Out table ordered three different items to share, but I must admit, I ate most of the Tiramisu. It was light and creamy and not overly sweet.   Service was outstanding - attentive but not smothering. Very professional and gracious. The timing and presentation were perfect. They were able to choreograph the entire evening to allow a leisurely experience while keeping us fed and attended to without intruding.   A dear friend recommended this restaurant to us. Unfortunately he passed away a few days after we ate here. My only regret for this entire experience was that he and his wife were not here to share this amazing meal with us.",

The experience begins with the wonderful greeting by the host/hostess. Every client is made to feel special and welcome. Once seated, someone with a giant half-wheel of Parmesan comes to carve out a small chunk and places it on your plate. Next comes bread, salami, zucchini and the best bruschetta you've ever had!  Every minute detail has been thought of and executed. The service is impeccable and perfect. The drinks are tops. The selection of Italian wines unrivaled.   I've had the Capellini Alla Arrabiata, Fetuccine Alfredo, Chicken Parmesan, and Branzino, just to name a few. Every, EVERY dish is amazing. EsPECIALLY the Branzino.   The desserts are to kill for, the coffee spectacular, and the grappa at the end of the meal just classy.   If you are looking for a world class experience, look NO FURTHER.

    "text": "In a few short words, Il Mulino is a beautiful fine dining Italian restaurant with delicious cuisine and classy ambiance.  Located on the second level of the Forum Shops at Caesars, it's right next to Tommy Bahama. It's quite a long walk from the parking garage or the room towers. Boyfriend and I were here for an early dinner. We were greeted and then led to our table. The minute we sat down, they started to bring us all these goodies. We got our choice of bread (the minute he said the word spicy, I said oh i'll take that!), salami and cold sauteed zucchini. YUM! What a delicious opener.   Then we were introduced to our captain and he told us the specials of the night. What caught my attention was the lobster ravioli. He said all pasta dishes can be made into an appetizer. Sounds good to me, small portion so I can get a taste of it. My lobster ravioli came with four. May not sound a lot but it can fill you up....I was already half full by that time. (Plus I still had an entree coming.)  For entrees we ordered: -Pollo in Crosta which is chicken sauteed with lemon and white wine in a parmigana crust. -boyfriend got one of the specials of the night: soft shell crab. It came with a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes.   I thought my chicken was alright. Very, very light flavoring....didn't really suit my taste buds. Which is understandable since my palette just had some lobster raviolis and those were fantastic!! I would get the raviolis again but not the chicken. Boyfriend thought his soft shell crab was good but he actually enjoyed my chicken more. Different strokes for different folks. Next time, I would definitely try their chicken parmesan or another one of their pasta dishes. There WILL be a next time; we really enjoyed this restaurant. We were too full for dessert but they gave us complimentary grappa to cleanse our palette.",

    "text": "Why I hated this restaurant.  I' m allowed one rant a year and this will be mine.  This is the most uppity, insincere restaurant experience you're likely to have.  Yes the atmosphere is over the top faux Italian and the waiters all wear expensive looking tuxedos but leave the attitude at your next failed acting audition.  Our set of waiters were so arrogant, smug and lacking in warmth.  An Italian night out should be about warmth, appreciation of the customer and genuine food.  Our main waiter made us feel cheap or lacking in taste every time a person didn't want an appetizer or wanted to split a dessert or was going to pass on that $40 glass of grappa.  Here's an excellent example.  I asked for the second cheapest bottle of wine on the menu--Chianti Classico for $80 a bottle.  Yeah it offends me that I can buy the same bottle for $12.  The waiter said, \"You'll really prefer the Riserva.\"  \"oh, how much is that?\"  \"It's $300\".   Well, thanks for the offer of letting me pay $300 for a $25/bottle of wine but I'll just plug my nose and drink that over-priced $80 bottle of banal Chianti.  Ok, the food is good--no question about it--but not outstanding.  I thought the cotoletta milanese was good and my wife enjoyed her simple papparadelle a pomodoro.  They made a grand production of the Limoncello and that was both fun and tasty.  Here's my humble conclusion.  Unless you are prepared to spend $200/person, expect to be treated like you're Jed Clampett on the Beverly Hills Hillbillies--coming from a waiter who probably earns 20% of what you do.  It simply wasn't a fun, edifying evening out.  Che peccato that we didn't go back to Parma which I gave 5 stars.  3 adults and 3 kids, one bottle of cheap wine, 2 appetizers, no dessert, 3 glasses of limoncello = $640",

    "text": "I really liked the Il Mulino in NY when I went 6 years ago so I thought that the one in Vegas would be comparable.  No, it's not.  The food here is basically a step above Il Fornaio but 2x as expensive.  I would probably have enjoyed my meal better if it had been more reasonably priced.  They start you off with a lot of fresh bread, fried zucchini, and some fresh bruschetta.  The best part of the start is when they bring a giant wheel of parmesan to your table and shave you off a little chunk.  This was delicious!  I thought this was a promising beginning but then each successive course sort of made me a little bit more disappointed.  The creamy fresh burrata I had to start was good and the portion was really large, but there wasn't any original or particular distinctively about it.  My boyfriend started with the fresh pappardelle in a meat sauce - I had a bite and it tasted pretty good to me, but my bf suspected that it seemed like the pasta had been microwaved since the temperature was so high.  For our entrees, I had the roasted whole branzino my bf had a lemony veal dish.  My fish was pretty good and very big, but I got tired of the same monotonous taste after awhile.  My boyfriend enjoyed his veal, but again, there wasn't anything special about it.  Service was very very fast.  Each successive course appeared within two minutes of the last one.  We were done with our meal in about an hour.  Our meal ended up over $250, which is similarly priced to a meal at, say, Babbo, but nowhere near as good or as memorable.  I would have been pleased with this meal if it had been about half the price, but as it stands, this place just isn't worth revisiting.",

We don't know why this is, but at dinner, the place is packed like anchovies in a tin, yet at lunch, you can hear echoes in the place.  If you want great service and very attentive waitstaff, go at lunch.  It's the same menu.  When you sit down, you immediately get salumi, cheese, and a few other items to get your juices flowing.  Then you can order drinks, wine, or whatever.  (If you are like us, you order two drinks and munch on appetizers and more cheese before even thinking of a main course and wine).  The bolognese here may be the best in the country.  Yes, it's that good.  And second full disclosure:  We've been to the NYC outpost (the original) of this restaurant, and this place is a perfect replica.  We return time and time again just for the bolognese.  The chicken parmesan is ho hum, but that's about the only negative we can think of here.  Everything we've ever tried on the menu is prepared and executed and presented without flaw.  Skip dessert but do let the waitstaff get you whatever limoncello is in the jug today.  It may very well be laced with crack - it's that good.",

Entrees were removed before being eaten, and the staff proceeded to produce a $700 bill for the table before she even recovered from the choking incident. This supposed high end dining experience consisted of a fast food drive-thru level of customer service. There are too many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas to waste your time and money at this joke of an establishment.",

    "text": "Went there on 12/28/2015 for a belated birthday dinner...for me!  Heard excellent things from a colleague and decided to give a go.  Everything everyone else said about the appetizers; the cheese; the grappa...all True.  The appetizers come as soon as you sit down.  Lots of different starches- garlic bread; regular bread, bruschetta, etc.  There was a eggplant appetizer and salami.  All very good.  The Captain goes over the specials- all of which are not listed on the menu he hands to you after he's done describing a list of specials.  So...pay close attention otherwise you  have to ask him to recite it again.  I had the mushroom ravioli and my husband had the seafood medley pasta.  Both very good.  I wanted to try some of the other specials, i.e., duck, fish, etc., but because everyone said to try the ravioli I decided I should try it in case I never get back there again.  We ordered dessert... and they gave me another one for my birthday.  My husband ordered the tartufo which was very good.  I  never saw it cut in half so cleanly before.  I had the lemon sorbet- very refreshing and a very generous serving I might add.  The \"free\" dessert was the chocolate cake which while sounded heavy it was actually very light.  Service was impeccable.  We never really saw the Captain again after he recited the specials and took our order, but the other waiters were all readily available to \"serve\" at a moments notice.  I would definitely go back.",

When you are seated, complimentary appetizers are brought out... a chunk of parmesan chisled right from the wheel, breads, bruschetta (I didn't care for this, was a bit soggy), a mussel, and my favorite, some zucchini concoction.  They were very thinly sliced, and I think sauteed or fried, with some olive oil, and served cold.  YUM.  There are little stoves set up at stations at various parts of the restaurant where they do some cooking, I guess finishing your dish because you can see and hear flames going up while you are there.  We started with the Caesar salad, which they made at one of the stations, it was great, one of the better Caesar's I have had.  (there was enough to split between two people)  For dinner I got the porcini ravioli with champagne cream sauce.  Amazing!  Hubby got the langoustines (grilled I think), which is kind of like a small lobster or large prawn.  I was afraid to order this, because I am picky about seafood, sometimes it is too fishy tasting for me.  Wow, I was pleasantly surprised!  They were tender and sweet, and the mushroom and pea risotto that was served with it was wonderful!  They make some of their own alcohol with fruit, I can't remember if it was brandy or not, and they also make their own grappa.  Unfortunately we had a show, so we were rushed and didn't have a chance to try it.  We will definitely be back on our next trip and make sure a show doesn't interfere with our dining experience!",

The actual ambiance is terrible the restaurant being a high end restaurant that requires you to dress appropriately(no shorts or sandals) had a cold large buffet room. The appetizers are great as the classic Il Mulino gives you delicious complimentary cheese, salami, and eggplant appetizers. Those were good. We ordered the clams casino which were ok very small and more bacon. My husband ordered a veal piccata which was also ok. I ordered pasta vongole with clams in a red sauce. That was also fair. We ordered an orange sorbet that was delicious. The service was very good though. The staff Cleared the tables at the right time. Waiter was attentive and knew the menu.   Over all it was average, I was expecting and hoping for the NYC experience.",

    "text": "I can tolerate bad food when there's great service, and I'll deal with awful service when there's amazing food.  But at Il Mulino, we paid $100/person for above-average food and below-average service.  You can do better in LV.  FOOD: Il Mulino starts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.  The parmesan cheese was great.  The bruschetta was decent, but I've had better.  The mussels were not fresh, but they're free.  None of the main courses wowed me, and at the price, they definitely should have.  The osso bucco ($48) was tender but bland, and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy, not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.  The lobster ravioli ($40ish) was overly cheesy and tasted nothing like lobster.  The veal chop (not sure) was totally dry and tasteless, like an overcooked pork chop.  The capellini with truffles and pancetta ($30) was the best main course, but I couldn't taste any truffle at all, so there was nothing too special about it.  SERVICE: Started great, ended pretty badly.  From the minute you sit down, servers swarm you and start throwing free food at you.  Awesome.  But our actual waiter was snide and inattentive.  When my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials, he scoffed, \"Really? Do I really have to do that again?\"  He forgot to bring out one of our dishes, which would have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.  Instead, after taking our order, he disappeared for the rest of the meal.  We ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.  Glasses went unfilled, plates uncollected.  I've had better service at Olive Garden.",

On their web site, Il Mulino boasts of world-class elegance but as far as ambience goes, I don't really see it standing out among other fine dining places on the Strip. We did enjoy the giant wheel of parmesan cheese being passed around from table to table and the staff being able to recite a long list of specials from memory.   They had complimentary bread and a side of zucchini, which were both way too oily. For our appetizer, escargots on mushrooms in a spicy tomato sauce. The escargots were tender although some had grit in them and doesn't make for a pleasant bite. The tomato sauce didn't do anything for me either. I had the roasted duck special with sweet potato mash and mixed berry sauce. The sweet flavors complemented the savory duck. The meat was moist but a bit on the chewy side. My husband had the bucatini and ordered a couple of glasses of Chianti Classico which they poured for us. I did notice that the wine bottle did not have the signature Chianti Classico black rooster seal. Not sure what to make of that. Anyway, the wine was OK so we didn't fuss. The bucatini was al dente and delicious. I have yet to meet bucatini that I didn't like. For dessert, we split the cheesecake. It seemed like a cross between cheesecake and pudding in flavor. It was surprisingly yummy. At the end of the meal, they offered us some grappa, which I would describe as Italian moonshine.",

I've always seen this place pop up so I figured \"What The Hell, Why Not Try It Out Now\" and boy am I glad that I did!!  II Mulino New York has officially made it to my \"favorite fine dining\" places to eat list! Looking for an elegant, romantic date night? Look no further! You can tell even before you walk in that this place really prides itself on exceptional customer service! From the time we walked in to the time we were wrapping up our meal, I can't think of one moment while dining that an employee didn't stop by and check on us. Our server was amazing, the staff who brings out the huge block of cheese was amazing, and even the person who was cleaning the plates off the table was great!    Since it was my first time here, I always like to pick the brains of whomever my sever will be to learn about the restaurant specialty cocktails and entrees. The menu had way too many good things to choose from but like the saying goes, \"When all else fails, go with what you know\" and I did exactly that! Our app/dinner selections were:  Complimentary Bread & Cheese  Oysters:   Pollo alla Parmigiana: Pounded, Breaded European Cut Chicken Breast Topped w/ Imported Cheeses and Marinara Sauce.   Pollo in Crosta 40.00 Chicken Sauteed w/ Lemon And White Wine Sauce In a Parmigiano Crust  Overall, everything was BEYOND exceptional and I really can't thank them enough for keeping that same level of service only an hour before closing! That speaks volumes to the moral of the management and team. I will be back very soon as I would love to dine out on their patio! Talk about VIEWS!!!!",

They greeted us by serving a large chunk of cheese off of a large block, and offered us a choice of three types of bread. The fried French bread was full of grease and very unsavory. I took a couple of bites and left it alone. They gave us complementary bruschetta, which was good. They also served some type of potato or eggplant dish, which was fried and reminded me of soggy French fries. We took a few bites and left the rest untouched. One of the servers cleared it later, and did not seem surprised that it was uneaten.   My husband ordered one of their specials, pasta with a bolognese sauce. It was good, but unfortunately made him ill by six the next morning. It was a combination of three types of meat within the sauce. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and ended up sending it back after one bite. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo as a replacement, which was good, but I have had much better. We were disappointed that the restaurant is so beautiful with superb service, but the food was so poor we will not return.",

Attentive and exceptional service, fantastic food and super awesome chef's complimentary appetizers like Parmesan cheese right off the wheel, zucchini chips, salami, tomato bruschetta and assortment of breads.  As soon as you get seated, before the menu is offered, you are treated to these amazing appetizers. My kids literally ask me to go here for the hunk of Parmesan cheese from the barrel.  Pasta is cooked a few feet away from your table, so it's served piping hot!! I love love that. I went for the vodka cream capellini with mushrooms and hubby chose the chicken Parmesan both were delicious! We also tried the 12 oz filet Mignon which was ok, the other Italian favorites are better.  The specials are on the pricier side, for eg mushroom ravioli in champagne cream sauce is $50, so better to ask the price of the special before ordering. They also charge split fee. For dessert we went for tiramisu which did not disappoint.  They also finish in style with complimentary grappa (alcoholic Italian brandy like beverage), apparently a digestif.. Perfect way to conclude a fantastic meal.",

This place is located in the Ceasar Palace Forum Shop. We came here on a Saturday night which was very crowded. We made sure to make reservations ahead of time and the restaurant also called us to confirm our reservation the day before.  They started us off with some parmesan cheese. I'm not a big cheese fan but their parmesan cheese was surprisingly good. They also offerred crackers, salami, in-house bread and fried zucchini. We ended up only ordering the main dish and drinks because their \"pre-appetizers\" were already plentyful.  I ended up ordering the lobster ravioli which was very mouth watering. It was rich and have just enough lobster that you can taste it all. The portion was quite large for me so  I'm glad I didn't order any appetizer.

Impeccable and shall I go as far to say as perfect and attentive service. A bit too many off menu specials to take in, but I grasped onto the Rock Salt Encrusted Whole Branzino. A few complimentary appetizers is standard Il Mulino but was a pleasant surprise for my wife and other couple. My problem is, I want to try everything! Food and service worthy of the price. My only disappointment was my Old Fashion cocktail was made with soda water and not fragrant, smooth or flavorful.",

    "text": "What a wonderful experience! Great attentive service and thoughtful wait staff. I love that they give several tastes prior to your entree/appetizer. That block of parm, I have dreams about. Also they are really nice if you ask for another chunk!   After going to Il Mulino several times, peak and non peak, the service is 100% regardless of how busy they are. Do plan on giving this place over an hour to eat at. This is a slow moment to enjoy the experience, not to shove food in your face and move on. Appetizer wise, the burrata and roasted red pepper was meh. I didn't like that there was only one slice of prochuitto. Entree wise, the clam pasta was just okay. There wasn't enough flavor from the clams, I found the garlic overpowering. Although those two dishes are advised to avoid, the salt crusted branzino is excellent. My most favorite dish here is definitely the squid ink pasta with crab. Giant pieces of crab and luscious cream sauce, no appetizer needed! Dessert is also great. Lemonchello tiramisu was fresh and light.  Price wise, it's as expected but you can clearly see where the high cost goes to. The wonderful staff, high quality ingredients, and beautiful ambiance. Would definitely go again anytime I'm in vegas.",

No hangovers, exquisite dining, and quality Vegas shows. This restaurant was highly recommended and we made reservations prior to dinner. This restaurant is nestled into the corner of the Caesar shops and just a skip and hop over from The Mirage. If I could imagine the most romantic, service-forward Italian restaurant - this is it.   This is TRULY a dining experience. Come hungry, and come ready to be serviced :) The meal starts with the legendary wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano and a few samples of appetizers. They really want you to enjoy the experience and take your time. They didn't provide the menus until after we had time to enjoy the cheese, bread, and appetizers which was SO refreshing. It's always nice to take time to reflect on the simple things in life such as fine wine, and the company of your friends.   The menu is sprinkled with traditional Italian fare and woven with house specials. We order a little bit of this and a little bit of that - you should too. If you're ballin' on a budget ... look elsewhere but if you have the cash to spend here .. do it. I will be back!",

Our son is all grown up and wanted to treat us to a nice meal. Both my husband and I now live in Vegas and this was our 3rd time dinning here.  The fried zucchini was a little soggy and chilled. However, the bruschetta was delicious.  We ordered fried calamari and clams oreganata for starters. Both were good. Main courses were Osso Bucco, Clams Vongole, Lobster Rivoli, Buccatini Amatriciana and Spaghetti Carbonara. The Osso Bucco was excellent but the risotto was kind of blend. Clams Vongole was tasty and so were the rest of the pasta dishes. Service was impeccable.  Overall, cannot be compared to their Flagship restaurant in terms of food and ambience...",

    "text": "Surprisingly underwhelming.  To start dinner, a wheel of Parmesan was brought to our table and the waiter cut two chunks for both of us. Great presentation, but the Parmesan we buy from Whole Foods is better. The Parmesan here didn't seem aged and had a soft texture.   The server then comes by, pours us a glass of water, and asks if we would like a wine menu. Our answer is of course \"yes\", so he says he'll bring the wine list.   Immediately following this interaction, small plates of food start coming out rather quickly. It was interesting. Could've been interesting in a good way, but it wasn't. All of the food that came out was SO COLD. It was evident everything delivered to our table was pre-made and had been sitting in a fridge. Everything was flavorful, but I couldn't get past the temperature.   So... four or so of these shockingly cold dishes come and go before our waiter comes back to our table. His first question, \"What would you like to drink - a cocktail/wine?\". I respond by stating we're still waiting for the wine menu. My statement was met with attitude from the server and he further asks if we're going to order glasses of wine or a bottle of wine.... I ask to see both options, but in my head I'm thinking wtf is going on herethere are so many people working with only a few tables seated and the service + food had all been subpar at best.   The wine list finally gets to the table and we put in our order for bucatini al'amatriciana and the veal chop. The bucatini is served with pancetta, not guanciale. The veal chop is massive.   For the price tag, I hoped to receive better service. The bucatini is nothing to write home about and the veal chop could have been better.",

A very expensive experience with food that is only good, not great (with exceptions).    But Il Mulino does succeed is being an experience.  The decor is elegant and \"rich\".  The staff, for the most part, polished and proficient, but not fawning.  You start off with complimentary breads including garlic bread, bruschetta, grilled zucchini, fabulous aged parmesan cheese.  All this before you order.  And you end the meal with complementary grappa.  The meal is well paced, the clientele interesting, and the food \"good enough\".  Since the main course portions are more than adequate, and you are already half full from the freebies, you can probably skip the appetisers.  Listen carefully to the long list of specials, recited at breakneak speed (interrupt if you need to), because a lot of the good stuff is here.  The bronzini baked in salt is much like signature dishes in fine restarants in Spain and Italy -- spectacularly good.  All of the pastas are good; don't order half portions as they are almost the same price as full portions.  Some of the meat dishes are only ok.  The bill will be high -- about $100 a person with a glass of wine, tax, tip, and maybe a dessert and side dish.  But if this is what you expected from Il Mulino, you will go away happy.",

    "text": "We were so excited to go to Il Mulino. My friends have been raving about it for years. Maybe our expectations were set too high, but it wasn't the best of times . . . it wasn't the worst of times.   What we liked.    No attitude at the door was a real surprise! The hostess was genuine and warm and we were seated at our table promptly at arrival.  The captain and waiters are all so gentlemanly in True Italian fashion. They never missed a beat!   The antipasti and assorted breads were the best part of the meal. That hunk of parm was one of the highlights for me -- so creamy and fresh.  Please sir . . . I want some more!. The amuse bouche was a tasty bit of bruschetta and yummy oyster and that was followed by a small plate of salumi and some delectable zucchini. The breads were simply decadent, the garlic one in particular. I could have stopped here and would have been completely content.  But no . . .   My husband started with the calamari fritti.  He is a calamari afficionado and was highly disappointed. The calamari was a little rubbery and flavorless, and the sauce bland.  I had the special of eggplant rolotini which came stuffed with crab and shrimp and a little cheese on top. It was so-so. It could have been so much better had they stuffed it with some ricotta inside and had a tangier tomato sauce. For a main entree, my husband had the Veal Marsala which he claimed was good, but not great.  While the service was elegant and attentive throughout the meal, they seemed to forget us when it came time to pay the bill . . . I thought that was rather odd in the US, but not so odd for the Italians who don't offer you a check until you ask for it.  As I said, it wasn't a bad experience; it just wasn't as special as I hoped.",

    "text": "WOW the best italian in VEGAS. I can fairly state that since I have lived here for 14 years and being from the east coast all I wanted to find was a good italian spot. Now this is on the pricey side, but the food is so worth every penny.  They always bring out a little appetizer with sliced meats and fresh cheese which I love. They also always end your meal with a little lemoncello, which is a nice touch.  I've ordered so many things from this place and have loved everyone of them! Eggplant Rolatini is to die for! I also had a papdelle pasta with a bolognaise that made my mouth water just looking at it. I've never been dissapointed with the food.  Why only 4 stars? Okay eveytime I have dined here I have gotten the same waiter.... he lists off about 30 specials they... half of them are on the menu, so i don't know why he describes them. The are litterally described word for word on the menu. So after he tells you 30-40 specials you can't even remember the first thing he said. he also really needs a mint... his breath is killer... makes me gag everytime. The good part is he does his rant for about 15min and that is the last time you see him. The bussers and his backup server does the rest.",

    "text": "I was going to give Il Mulino 5 stars, but the end of our dinner experience left a lot to be desired.  Off the bat, the hostesses were in on the little surprise I had for my two colleagues and they worked with me to execute it perfectly.  This was greatly appreciated!  And the assorted breads they initially brought out to our table... oh, these were the best breads I have ever had!  Fresh, buttered, and very flavorful.  They were accompanied by delightful little plates of fried zucchini and salumi.  One of the staff members went around with a huge, aged wedge of parmesan cheese and hacked off chunks onto our little plates, which we rather enjoyed.  Our food was near-perfect.  The calamari appetizer was done very well, though the amount of marinara greatly exceeded the available calamari.  I loved my porcini risotto which had the right texture and rich mushroom flavors, and my boyfriend's veal was probably the best veal I've eaten (we split our dishes so we could each get our grain and meat).  Dessert was delicious too.  5 star food.  The interior is not huge, but it filled up after 7PM.  White tablecloths and dark wood with higher ceilings and expansive views of the strip from the top floor of The Forum Shops gives Il Mulino a masculine yet intimate vibe.  They didn't seat anyone on the grand patio that day, but we could still see outside very well.  It was lively in there as there were at least two larger parties with a hint of drunkenness interspersed.  But overall it was very nice.  4 stars.    Complimentary grappa at the end was like hot jet fuel going down my throat.  The way they served it was fascinating: from a large urn-like container that was completely coated in a 1\" thick layer of ice, they ladled it out into tiny glasses.  It was super strong.  The taste is nothing like the complimentary ouzo one gets at the end of a Greek meal, but it was served with the same generous spirit of \"welcome and thank you for partaking in our meals.\"  Fumes rolled around in my head for awhile.  So why only 3* overall?  Two paragraphs:  The servers put on airs that I'm not a fan of.  It didn't help that our \"Team Captain\" of the servers acted utterly confused when I asked him if there were non-alcoholic house options (I was on meds).  He seemed mystified but apparently communicated well enough to the bartender because he brought back a delicious concoction containing  lemonade.  Still, the attitude of the servers was rather off-putting, and maybe they're used to serving rich foreign tourists because most of the fancy places we've been to don't have snooty servers like these guys.   Then the last half hour of our experience, the staff forgot us.  We were ignored after having been waited on very well for the first two and a half hours.  Look, Il Mulino, the last part of our meal is what we're going to remember the most, and it didn't help you guys just darted around us.  We had to actually raise our hands and say something for you to come over.  Second, the girl acted like it was a major inconvenience to split the check... and it was just four of us.  Do they not get conference-goers in town who are living on a per diem as paid by our individual companies???  Finally, nowhere did we see that they did not accept Discover credit cards.  Come on, a place like this doesn't accept Discover?? Not the staff's fault for being the messenger, but they should've put stickers up or something.  I'm glad we came here to try it, even though it's a chain, because the food was excellent.  I give it a lukewarm recommendation, but personally, I do NOT think that WE will be back, at least for dinner.  So many other places that probably give more bang for the buck.",

    "text": "Out experience at Il Mulino was nothing short of spectacular! Service was top notch (and we have dined at many top restaurants). Ambiance was petite and warm with a low hum of the patrons. Upon entering we were quickly seated and a gentlemen bearing an enormous wheel of aged Parmesan and a fresh bread selection. It was an impressive start of a meal we will never regret. Throughout the dinner, our table remained clean and staff were beyond eager to remove used plates to maintain a pleasing presentation as we ate. Cocktails were handmade and wine list was impressive. I had the pesce pomodoro with white wine sauce that was the most balanced dish of this type. My husband had the branzino (Italian sea bass) cooked to perfection, filleted table side and covered with a delicate lemon butter sauce that complemented the flavor of the bass so well. The portions were more generous than most high rated restaurants in Vegas. Even though we were already so full after eating most of our entrees, we still couldn't leave without dessert. I had the creme brulee (my favorite). It was creamy, sweet and the mandatory brulee crisp cracked perfectly. My husband had the tiramisu, it as well was made with flavor that wasn't too rich and the texture was ideal without it being soggy. Once we finished up, our leftovers were packaged neatly and more fresh bread included. The bill arrived, the prices overall were much more conservative than it's peers. A captain's tip along with a generous server gratuity was given and we were on our way. The only con I can provide is that this restaurant isn't 2,000 miles away. I could eat here every day and have the elite service consistently. Needless to say, we will be back here for another amazing dining experience next fall.",

Upon arriving, you are immediately served complimentary fresh Parmesan cheese, bruschetta and mussel, marinated zucchini and garlic toast.  The servers allow you time to enjoy with wine/cocktails.  The wine list offers an extensive variety of bottles and wines by the glass.  The menu is mouthwatering with an amazing selection of appetizers and entrees.  In addition to the menu, the table captain will make your stomach growl even more as he tells you the specials.  On our most recent visit, my husband and I started out with the shrimp scampi appetizer which was mouthwatering.  I had Dover Sole to die for!  My husband had whole fish Branzino that he says is the best he has ever had!  Their pasta and veal dishes are off the charts too.  And if you have room the desserts are a must!  And it doesn't end there, at the end of your meal the table server will offer you Limoncello.  If you want to experience Italian food at its finest, a trip to Il Mulino next time you are in Las Vegas is a MUST!!!",

    "text": "While we had a nice meal at Il Mulino I have to say that I am disappointed with our overall experience.  On vacation in Las Vegas, we decided to dine at Il Mulino Las Vegas. When we were ready to order, I had decided to get the mushroom ravioli. At the last minute I asked the waiter about a special he had mentioned.  The waiter proceeded to tell me about this amazing special including Parpadelle and white truffles.  The description of the meal went on for about 4 min. I decided I would try it and the waiter asked if I would like a small or large and proceeded to explain the small was very small.  I went with the large.  The meal came out, I ate my pasta which was OK, tasted like a fettuccini alfredo, and then the bill came.  I almost fell off my chair when we saw how much my meal was.  My pasta dish, which I declined to take the left overs (mistake), ended up costing $160 dollars! We were shocked. My son and husbands meals were around $50 each.  The mushroom ravioli (which was also a special)  I had originally decided on was $50. To find out that my meal was $160 was an absolute shock and I feel like I was grossly deceived by your restaurant.  When the average price on the menu is $40, it is your responsibility to inform your customers the cost of a meal quadruple the price. When I called the manager just to inform her that she should really tell the other patrons when a special is so expensive, she told me \"it's a special\" in the same sentence as telling me that the other specials were only around $60.  I gave Il Mulino a fair chance to redeem themselves for deceiving me and they failed to have any remorse over the situation.",

There is no way in hell these ravioli's were made in house.  And if I am wrong, they should be ashamed of the quality and the taste.  They were VERY fishy tasting and the pasta was mushy.  Never mind the fact that these ravioli's came with a $50.00 price tag, I wouldn't pay $10.00 for these.   To top off this travesty, they give you house made grappa.  Nothing enjoyable about it.

    "text": "My friends had been to this restaurant the previous year and had raved about it all year long. This year we made reservations for one of their birthdays. She was very excited, recounting the details from the previous year.  We arrived on time and were seated on the patio as requested. It was a very nice night and just captured the essence of Las Vegas. They immediately brought appetizers of fried zucchini and garlic breads to the table, as well as carved pieces off a very large chunk of parmesan. These were all very delicious. I had a wonderful arugula salad, and my wife had the prosciutto and cheese appetizer that was magnificent. For the main course I had the lemon veal. It was mediocre at best. My wife had the ravioli that we all agreed was no better than the Costco bulk ravioli (which is still good). During the course of the meal I had to ask several times to have my water refilled (this is not usually a big deal, but when they charge thirteen dollars for a bottle of water, I shouldn't have to keep reminding them that I'm thirsty). After bringing us our meals and making a quick trip around the table, our entire wait staff disappeared for over half an hour. Leaving our party and another couple alone on the patio. Going through the wine list, the waiter was continuously pushing a bottle that we weren't interested in. I checked on my phone and found that this bottle that they attempted to sell us for $215 retails at Vons for $22. Needless to say we didn't choose that one. We did choose a bottle that was good (I can't quite remember the label, but it paired very well). By the time we had finished, we were unsatisfied with the restaurant and went elsewhere for dessert.  No part of the restaurant, the food, or the service was awful. However, the combination of those when compared to the amount of money being spent made it a bad experience. We spent over $150 per person. For that amount of money I expect exceptional service and incredible food. I experienced neither mediocre of both. If you have money to waste, give it a try. But if you want a great high class meal, look elsewhere.",

I had made a reservation for 8:30PM, and called at 5 to see if they could seat us earlier, and they were so accommodating they found us a space at 6:30.  I can't tell you how much we love this restaurant.  the staff is very professional and polite.  the appetizers they bring out while you are looking at the menu is enough to fill you up.  They give you a chunk of aged parmesan cheese, salami, bruschetta, and this fried spicy zucchini that is to die for.  I always eat way too much before I have even ordered.  the pasta dishes are huge, fresh and some are prepared at a table by the front door so you can watch. There is not a dish I wouldn't want to try, and unfortunately I can only order one entree.  The desserts are also amazing.  Please don't miss eating here if you come to Las Vegas, I have been to dozens of high end restaurants here and this is one of the best you will find.  I am going back in December, and will make my reservation well in advance this time!  Buon Appetito!",

Tuxedo clad waiters seated us promptly upon arriving and brought a round of appetizers shortly there after including aged parmesen cheese cut directly from the biggest wedge I have ever seen. We also ordered a fantastic eggplant appetizer that was a special for the day. I enjoyed the porcini mushroom ravioli with a champagne truffle sauce as my entree and it was amazing. We ended our lunch with the tiramisu and the tartufo. Both were excellent. Afterwards we were offered complimentary grapa. I can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Not too ecstatic about this place.  We were there fairly late in the evening on a Sunday, place was packed.  With the starters and cocktails we were off to a fantastic start.  My girlfriend had the carpaccio, I had the spinach salad.  We loved these. However, for entrees both of us were disappointed.  The lobster ravioli was fairly light and ok tasting but nothing special.  My girlfriend said it tasted exactly like the lobster ravioli we get from Costco, definitely nothing to write home about.  I had the Dover sole special. The preparation and smells coming from this were amazing.  My grumble here was the prep was done the other side of the room, table side would have been memorable.  The fish was mushy, not firm and delicate, as I was expecting.  As well it had very little taste and too many bones.  The wine selection/service by the sommelier was a disappointment to say the least.  Overall compared to other fine italian restaurants I have eaten at(Cafe Juanita, Bartolotta etc) this one is low on the list from this experience.",

I had the luxury of decanting my bottle of wine after a win at the tables.  They will do it with a nice bottle of wine.

    "text": "Myself and a party of 10 others had dinner here last weekend. The reservations were made by a hotel concierge while we were at the pool so no research was done prior to this.   I would say the things to note are this: 1. the parm cheese and appetizers they bring out are complimentary and delicious 2. the wine list is quite pricey 3. they ask you if you'd like bottled water or sparkling water upon sitting down - THIS IS NOT FREE - we got charged for 8 bottles of water at $8 a pop and never did we see them opening the bottles at the table which leads to a suspicion that they might be getting filled up in the back  w/ a lesser quality bottled water (hopefully I am wrong). Curious if there is a free tap water option. I recommend asking. 4. there are a ton of specials the waiter rattles off that are not on the menu so bring your listening ears 5. the food prices were reasonable - $20-$40 range for most 6. there's plenty of food to share a meal with someone, especially after all the appetizers 7. I ordered Spezzatino di Pollo alla Romana - I was not impressed. The flavors were so-so and the artichoke pieces still had a good enough portion of the leaf on them that they were inedible as served. I spent at least 5 minutes trying to chew the first piece I mistakenly put in my mouth because I didn't want to spit it into my napkin.  I wouldn't go back again on my own, but would not be upset if someone else took me there.",

    "text": "Yet another Las Vegas incarnation of a \"big name\" restaurant that is all name and little game. My wife and I and our friend are all business exex in our 50's and were in Vegas for business. We reserved a table via Open Table (hey maitre d, shouldn't' that have been a clue that we were not a group of dimwits from some small town who think Michelin stars have something to do with tires?) We arrived promptly for our 8pm table, dressed in fashionable (read as expensive) jeans and such and of course my wife was flashing her 5 carat canary diamond ring. The hostess greeted us and noted that she would ask the maitre de what table to seat us at. He gave us the once over and she lead us to table 23, which is a four top in the middle of the room, which was about 2/3 full. There was a nice table against a window that was much more private and the hostess was taken a bit aback when we asked for it. My wife commented that we did not appreciate being given a crappy table, but that's Vegas: lots of ass, but little class. When we got to the table we wanted, the hostess had the lack if insight to comment that some people ask for tables in the middle of the room. Sure they do, just like people assigned to aisle seats on their flights ask for middle seats. The hostess did seat us and in the midst of her all attitude, no gratitude hissy fit, I told her that \"we did not just get of the bus from Omaha and we expect the same level of service as your NY location\".   So, big deal, they give you some \"free\" apps: nice sliced zucchini, a chunk of decent Parmesan, bread and some bruschetta. The drink taker had almost no clue about the wines by the glass other than genius remarks like \"it's tart\" or \"it's light\". Somehow, he kept steering us to the pricier wines. BTW, their wines were $14-$27 per glass. I settled for a $16 Sauv Blanc that was marginal. I then ordered a $14 Chianti that was equally average. Overpriced wine is another clue that a restaurant is all about money, not honey.   This part is the worst. My wife and friend asked if a single Caesar was large enough to split and asked if they could split a half order of pasta. Waiter: \"why yes, of course\"..... Check comes and these thieves charged for 1 1/2 salads and for a full order of pasta. Liars!  Next one really pissed me off. My wife and I wanted to share a chicken entree, but the waiter, I mean thief, said that it was a small portion, so I ordered another entree for me. Guess what? The dish was more than adequately large for sharing. Liars! And guess what else? Both her bird dish and mine were marginal as in dry and salty. But then I guess most of their customers were raised on Burger King and Mickey D's so they think dry, salty polity is the bomb. Of course, we didn't do our job and send our dishes back. My policy is often to take the route of why make a bad experience worse.   Bottom line: eat the apps and feign illness.... Leave a tip to cover their trouble and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I was on the fence for a 3 star verse 4 star review here. It really was a wonderful meal and dining experience so I went for the 4 stars. The only thing is how overpriced it is. I ate alone, for lunch, on a Tuesday while shopping at The Forum Shops in Caesars. I literally could have made a meal out of the \"starters\" they give you - fried zuchini, wedge of pamasan cheese, garlic bread and sticks, and brushetta and salami. All of that was so tasty. Because all of that came with my meal I didn't mind that my lunch entree was $36. I definitely think that is overpriced though. It was paparadelle in Bolognese sauce, very tasty! I was also a tad annoyed that I was charged $7 for water and then I asked for an iced tea and that was $8. Also, when I went to leave the tip, on the receipt it had a spot for a tip and then also a tip for the table \"Captain\" - I never heard of that before. So I wound up giving both of them a tip and my grand total for lunch, just for me by myself was $71! It was good and the service was wonderful so I can't complain. Plus I did want t o splurge on something nice. I probably won't go back next time I am there though because I think that you can get just as good food for less. Plus I hate that $7 water tactic.",

    "text": "Had dinner there two nights ago and was looking at the reviews today.  I understand where people are coming from and I'm at a disadvantage because I don't have too many other Vegas restaurants to compare it too.  It is a fairly upscale place in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Hotel.  The service is top flight.  The moment you sit down they are on you with fresh parmesan cheese, garlic bread, sliced salami and fried zucchini.  I had dover sole in butter and lemon sauce that was very good.  They present it to you at the table before they debone it and serve it.  Fancy, I guess, but hardly necessary.  It was way better than the dover sole at the Caesar's buffet I had the next night.  My wife had a baseball cut filet mignon that was good but a little overcooked.  I can't really blame the restaurant.  I keep trying to tell my wife they need to be medium rare to medium at most and she insists on telling them medium well which usually ends up being well.  This is a sure way to kill a great piece of beef.  The caesar salad was ok and the wine, while good, was overpriced.  My wife ordered a tartufo for dessert which we shared.  Now I'll claim ignorance about what a tartufo is.  What they served us was like a giant bon bon, cut into fourths, arranged on a plate with whipped cream and those little cookies that are shaped like pencils.  Anyway, whatever it was it was pretty good.  We finished the evening with something called lemoncello which I've never had before.  Another couple with us were from New York and the wife was an Italian New Yorker.  She said it was a licor made from lemons and vodka and was traditionally served at the end of an Italian meal in New York.  So there you have it.  The meal ran about $200/person but we had three bottles of wine.  Still, everything in the place is a la carte and it's not for those on a budget.  I enjoyed my meal but it sounds like most  reviewers felt the same as I did about the place.",

    "text": "Solid dinner here on our last night in Vegas. I've never been to the NY location so this was a real treat. As with most Vegas restaurants, the atmosphere is lacking but here the food and service were pretty top notch.  We were seated and given some yummy complimentary apps- a nice change of pace from most dinners now where you get charged just for a bread basket!   We ordered: An appetizer special- figs stuffed with cheese, wrapped in prosciutto w/ a balsamic glaze- super tasty!  Their signature Ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a creamy truffle sauce. Yum! Totally delicious. $50 was a bit insane but I'm glad I indulged this once  Their special Lobster Ravioli- good, nothing too amazing, I've had comparable ravioli elsewhere so not work the $48  The Tartufo desert-good, simple chocolate & vanilla ice cream sphere with a hard chocolate shell and whipped cream.  Not sure I'd go again because of the price but I'm glad I experienced it once. This is a \"can't go wrong\" Italian spot if you're ok with the price point. Also, once thing to note that was odd is that when the bill came there were 2 lines for tip- one for the Captain's Tip (basically our main waiter) and then a separate generic tip. There was no explanation given so I took the tip I wanted to give and split it 50/50 on each line. This kinda rubbed me the wrong way. Was the other tip for the busboys and other servers who came with the drinks, appetizers, etc? My husband referenced a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where something very similar happened with Larry and I immediately related.",

I couldn't been more impressed with the service and the food. There was multiple complementary items - starters, dessert wine, dessert, and champagne.   We ordered the beef carpaccio, the artichoke hearts, and caprese to start. I would highly recommend the carpaccio then the caprese. I didn't care much for the artichoke hearts with bacon - I feel like it wasn't incredibly impressive on taste and hitting multiple flavors of the tongue.   For an entree, I ordered the saltimbocca. It was a toss up between that and the lobster ravioli with a truffle sauce, which my friend ordered. Both the saltimbocca and the ravioli were phenomenal. Probably the best saltimbocca I've ever had, and I've had a lot of saltimbocca.   As far as the price is concerned, I felt the wine is overpriced, but I didn't have a problem spending $130 for a bottle of The Prisoner, which you can get in the store for $40. And overall price - no problem with at all. It was less than 100 bucks a person, which is pretty good, in my opinion.   Overall, great place. Don't take your own wine. Enjoy the service, it's nearly impeccable. Cheers!",

    "text": "Easily the best italian food I've had outside of Italy. The service is outstanding. You have the captain (the dapper older gentleman whose name escapes me) who rattles off a few dozen mouth watering \"specials\", a waiter who is especially attentive and the best when it comes to dessert and the bus boys that make sure your water is filled to the top every time you take a sip.   I've been to this restaurant a few times and each time I leave feeling satisfied and happy. They have a full bar and good italian wine selection. They bring to your table an assortment of \"goodies\" courtesy of the chef. You always get a chunk of delicious parmesan cheese and a basket of warm tasty soft and crispy bread. This time they added lightly fried zucchini and garlic bread. This is all before you've even seen the menu.  We started with this shrimp and crabmeat rolled in eggplant and it was outstanding. I had tried it before and insisted we order it since the spouse wasn't with me last time. Amazing. Even if you're not an eggplant fan. The captain explained that since they cook the eggplant twice (first fried - then baked) it takes away the bitterness of the eggplant. The spouse got the ravioli special with mushrooms and truffle sauce. It was amazing. I tried the chicken with asparagus, mushrooms, artichoke (hold the peas) and it was heavenly. My all time favorite though is the pasta with braised short rib which wasn't a special this trip or on the menu. I guess I could have asked if they could have prepared it for me but I wanted to venture out and try something new.  We got this orange thing for dessert. The waiter went and selected all this amazing looking fruit and assembled it right in front of us. Poured a healthy amount of liquor over the whole thing. Delicious.  Overall, it's a must try if you are anywhere in Vegas. You'll be glad you did. Make a reservation as the place is relatively small and in high demand.",

    "text": "This place is too stuffy and formal for Vegas.  I went here to dine with a few close friends last time I was in Vegas and we just felt uncomfortable the entire time.    My friend decided to wear a polo shirt and shorts which apparently is a huge No-No; the hostess gave us a stern warning and told us that normally we would not be allowed to enter - but she made an exception this time.  She should've added that along with the one-time exception, the wait staff would up their game accordingly, to make the dining experience that much more uncomfortable.   We were seated, at which point we met the most bizarre waiter I have ever encountered.  He had the personality of a finely polished ball of Italian marble and seemed entirely unable to relate to any type of human experience.  His main goals in life seemed to be to bask in the glory of a 200 lb wheel of Parmesan cheese that he brought to our table; and get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible.  Our waiter asked for our drink order immediately and either did not understand the concept of a drink menu and/or was extremely put out by having to bring it to us before we decided on drinks.  Based on his.. personality? I think it was more the former.    I'll add one quick thought on the food:  Good but not worth the prices they were charging - especially with this incredibly bizarre service and stuffy environment.  Also, I guess my veal marsala was \"too refined\" for a side of noodles or any other type of side dish accompaniment.    I should add that Il Mulino also has \"captains\" which apparently are some type of waiter team leader.  Captains also fully expect a tip - as seen by a tip line for both our waiter and the captain.  Good luck on how to tip in his fashion as we had no idea.  I would only recommend this place to amateur social scientists on the off chance that you might get our waiter.  Watching him interact with humans -  as if it was the first time ever for him - was a truly unique experience.",

    "text": "Amazing! Service and food were excellent. Honestly, I always passed by this place and thought it looked small, must not be that special. But went here for date night the other day and oh my goodness I was amazed. So romantic! As soon as we walked in, the decor was exquisite, each table had a single fresh red rose and a real candle that illuminated the dimly lit room. Each time I passed by a server/runner they always said \"Bellisma, please, bellisma!\" which I only could imagine was an endearing/polite term. Everybody was so nice and genuine and I loved the Capitan! It is very unique how the Capitan delivers the specials verbally and he was so charismatic. The view was stunning and I have never had Ossobucco taste as good as theirs in my life.. It was even better than my mother's ossobucco, and that says a lot. Price was cheaper than I had thought, we also had the chocolate cake with coffee and it tasted extremely rich but the texture was so light and airy... I bit into it and I would order it a thousand times again. The oysters were fair, good but not extraordinary compared to others I have had. We also got the pasta with clams, scallops, octopus... I forgot what it was called but that tasted great! The sauce was very light but flavorful enough, there were more than enough seafood too. I hate when there is never enough seafood but they were so generous with it. At the end, they brought us at grapa (if I spelled that correct) and I thought that was really unique as well, it helped with the digestion so we did not feel too full when leaving. I loved the overall ambiance, so romantic and professional and the food matched my 5 star rating as well!",

We told our waiter, immediately upon sitting down at the table, we had 7:30pm tickets for Elton John concert - also at Caesar's Palace. We were clear that we did not have time to dilly dally. The waiter did not concern himself with our time constraints. He took an exceptionally long time before taking our dinner order and did not bring our food to the table until 7:20pm, despite our repeated requests that he speed things up, so we would not be rushed eating. We only had a minute or two to eat before having to leave for the concert and wound up leaving most of our dinner on our plates. What we ate tasted good, but the overall dining experience was sub par. Later in the evening, I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager about our experience. She told me over and over that our waiter has worked for the restaurant for 13 years and has a good reputation. She also told me the restaurant was extremely busy this evening and that's just the way it goes on busy nights. Plan accordingly if you plan to dine here.",

This place means to feed you from the moment you walk in as several complimentary appetizers are served upon being seated. The menu is extensive and there is also a list of running specials not on the menu  ( the mushroom ravioli was on the specials and was wonderful)  Service was great and mindful without being disruptive to the meal.

We live in Fairfield County in Connecticut and we eat at some of the best restaurants around. I am Italian and know good Italian food. That being said, this place is average as far as Italian food. The veal oso bucco was a little dry. The risotto was pretty good. My wife's ravioli were good. The bigger issue is the cost. These dishes were both specials and the prices were not revealed when the waiter gave them to us. I never expected them to be priced so much higher than anything else on the menu. $50 for porcini mushroom ravioli???? $60 for veal??? This was crazy! You should never charge that much more for specials and not disclose it. Ravioli are never that much with lobster meat let alone mushrooms! Stay away from these jokers.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Il Mulino in 3 months, and I had a much better time this visit than my first, notably because of the service - the food was perfection both times. Our Captain the first time was unfriendly and pretentious. This time, our Captain - Wabi? - was extremely friendly and personable, as was Peter our main waiter and the additional staff that presented and cleared dishes.  My recommendation is to pay attention to the (very long) list of the day's specials and order from that menu because the dishes are more unique than the regular menu, which has your basic Italian staples. The list that the Captain rattles off is a little hard to remember, but if you have a good one, he'll repeat it. Also enjoy the starters of freshly grated Parmesano, bruchetta, and antipasti, but try not to fill up as much as you'd love to. I'm not a wine drinker, so I recommend the Lucrezia Borgia cocktail. I've had excellent Pappardelle with cinghiale, arugula salad, burrata, and eggplant with risotto dishes here. Absolutely every dish has been amazing, although the portions are HUGE. I wish I lived in LV so I could take my pasta home for later. :(   My mother was celebrating her 70th birthday and specifically asked to dine here, and they were so very nice to her and brought her a dessert (fabulous as well!) They also typically have complimentary Grappa but this night had housemade Limoncello that I actually enjoyed more than that I've had in Sorrento.  This experience redeemed Il Mulino for me, and I'll absolutely, 100% return the next time I'm in town, although I still think asking for a separate Captain's tip is absurd.",

    "text": "We booked this restaurant for our anniversary celebration in Vegas based on the reviews here. And seriously. It didn't disappoint. In fact, it surpassed all of our expectations.   First, the ambiance is perfect for a romanic dinner. The decor has a sort of old world feel that makes it seem like you've been transported to Italy. The lighting is dim, not too dark where you can't see your food or your date, but just enough to set the mood. As soon as you sit down, you are greeted with food. A big hunk of cheese, salami and some fried zucchini. I didn't tell my husband about this part ahead of time and he was super excited. Next came the bread and a taste of the most delicious bruschetta we'd ever had. I wanted to eat it all but I didn't want to fill up before even ordering my main.   We both settled on pasta with vodka sauce. My husband got the lobster ravioli and it was filled with huge chunks of lobster. It was so delicious. I got the gnocchi and had a religious experience while eating it. They were perfectly delicious little pillows of yumminess (yes, that is a technical term).   I didn't think we'd have any room for dessert, but I couldn't turn down a cannoli.  I love cannoli. While we were eating our dessert, the waiter came by and gave us a sample of grappa. Not for the faint of heart, grappa was described as Italian moonshine. And that's the best way to describe it. They say it helps with digestion so I gave it a try. While I can't speak to that, it certainly helped end dinner with a bang.  The service was also impeccable from start to finish. I highly recommend Il Mulino if you are in Vegas for a special occassion and don't feel like fancy French food or a giant steak.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my porchini mushroom ravioli, they were delicious. My mother-in-law's lobster ravioli were also very good. My husband liked his langustinos from a special menu, but said next time he would order my porchini mushroom ravioli. My father-in-law's osso bucco was good, but I had better in other restaurants. Unfortunately, his side dish - saffron risotto was badly overcooked (Gordon Ramsey would throw it in the face of whoever cooked it). Besides, nobody told us that it would be saffron risotto -- not all people like it, and it is important to highlight that it is not just a risotto, but heavily infused saffron risotto.   My sister-in-law's special order was delicious! She got herself veal marsala with some linguini. Pasta was cooked perfectly and veal was very tender, covered with tasty mushroom sauce. Strawberry mojito ($15) was very nicely made. You could feel fresh fruits with mint and quality rum.The drink was so good that I ordered it again, and if we stayed longer I would order third without any hesitation.  Now, the negatives. Do we have to sit and listen for 10 minutes while the \"captain\" is listing all the specials they have? Honestly, I have never had to sit through such a long list of specials, it was a little bit ridiculous. If you have that many specials, please print them out on a separate piece of paper, and if someone want a more thorough description the \"captain\" can verbalize it. Do not bring any free dishes if they are not good. With a bill of over $700 for 5 people without any appetizers I expect better than oily zucchini. Cheese was good (more of it please), brushetta was decent, but cold cuts and zucchini were not good at all. Just skip mediocre free food, do not even serve it.   I would definitely return, but be very careful with what I order. Go for their specialty, do not experiment too much.",

It is hard to imagine we would not have partaken in this opulent dining experience had we not signed up for the owners' meeting at the Marriott Grand Chateau .  Fortunately , the staff graciously excused our ordinary dress code.  A reservation is a must- we dined early at 5 pm . The atmosphere was intimate and intoxicating at times . The captain and his staff, including Ciro, Tremente, Edwardo, Suarez, Tyler, Scott and Denis presented us with unexpected , delicious treasures throughout the meal, including chunks of fresh parmesan cheese, cold sauteed zucchini, bruschetta, to a variety of baked breads and capping off the evening with a white raisin brandy tasting .  The captain introduced many lovely specials and highlighted his favorites from the main and theatre menu .  Our taste buds were popping all night and all four of us agreed that this was our most favorite dining experience in years.  It is literally tucked away on the third floor in the Forum of Caesars so many may miss this amazing foodie experience . The beverages were superb including my Aprel spritzer and my husband's Meiomi Pinot Noir. I rate them a 5 star plus +",

Il Mulino never fails to deliver an absolutely delicious and memorable evening and last night was no exception.  To start, as soon as you're seated, they bring out they bring out a selection of delicious breads along with a huge wedge of cheese from which they'll cut you a piece. The breads are so yummy - perhaps due in part to the high oil content, but if you're eating here, you've pretty much written off trying to be healthy at least for 1 meal, so just enjoy it :) Next up is some bruschetta (I'm veggie, but if you're not, it typically comes with mussels), fried zuchini and salami (again if you're not veggie). All of this, before you even order! To be honest, I was pretty full before I even looked at a menu!  We got the special mushroom ravioli in champagne cream sauce. Best sauce I've ever had, bar none. I'd almost go back to Vegas just for this sauce. The capellini with vodka sauce was almost equally delicious.  We were celebrating a birthday (which I had noted on my OpenTable reservation), so they brought us out a cannoli with a candle (on the house) and sang. It was really sweet of them to do this and the cannoli was to die for.  Oh, and did I mention the drinks are great too? Amazing wine selection and they make a really delicious sangria.  Overall, if you're willing to throw calorie counting out the window (after all, you're in Vegas), definitely go here!",

The zucchini was very bland along with the mussels. The garlic bread was very oily and the bruschetta was just okay. I would recommend skipping these.  We ordered the caprese salad and it was magical. The mozzarella was sooo fresh and the tomato came out super chilled. The balsamic vinegar was phenomenal. Highly recommended!  I ordered the capellini and the bf ordered the bucatini. We both loved our dishes. I loved my sauce a little more because I prefer cream sauces. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was well seasoned.   Service was good. Our waters were always full and the plates were cleared at the perfect time. Our server was a little persistent on drink ordering but I stuck with my water.   This place looks very romantical (yes I said romantical) when you step in, but you'll find that it gets loud in the dining room so you lose some of the magic.   I'll definitely be back!",

For the main course, we shared manicotti stuffed with spinach, ricotta, and mars Capone cheese with sides of spinach and broccoli. I don't know how one person could have eaten the whole thing. Even splitting the entre, we had leftovers, which we took with us and later gave to a homeless person who was hungry. We had no room leftover for dessert, but made room for a sinful chocolate souffle compliments of the house to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday weekend.  Considering everything, I felt the prices were quite reasonable. Will definitely return here in the future.",

    "text": "My brother recommend Il Mulino. My wife and I made dinner reservations for 12/3/16 and we were extremely impressed by everything Il Mulino had to offer.   The cheese was amazing. The different breads were amazing. The tomatoes are literally the best tomatoes we've ever eaten. The entree was very delicious - we both had the Lobster ravioli. Definitely one of my favorite dishes I've had - anywhere!   Now, let's talk about the service. My wife and I got caught up in watching how amazing the staff works together. It was like watching an orchestra perform. There was a moment when a staff member picked up an empty plate along with the tab from another table and when he was walking towards the back, he had the plate behind him. Another staff member walking towards his direction intercepted the plate so he could take care of the tab while the other member picked up plates from another table. I'll admit, I'm probably not explaining it that well, but it was a thing of beauty. It was just one example of how well the staff works together.  Another example is that not one time did my wife or I ask for anything. That's how attentive they were.   Next time we visit Vegas, we will make sure to come back.",

    "text": "It is not often that one gets to dine in a place where the service is flawless from start to finish. Il Mulino is such a place. Their attention to detail in every aspect of the experience is nothing short of perfection. During dinner, I inadvertently knocked my purse off of the chair, and before it hit the floor one of the staff was there to pick it up for me. The most excellent service in the world wouldn't be the same without the food to back it up, and I was delighted to find out everything we ordered was exquisite. In addition to what you order off the menu, diners are presented with complementary antipasti which begins with (my favorite!) a giant wheel of Parmesan cheese brought to the table, and a generous hunk of cheese is cut off just for you. It is quickly followed by heavenly garlic bread, focaccia bread, soft Italian bread, a plate of salami, and bruschetta (best ever!) with mussels (no shellfish for me, so I passed). Once we got around to ordering, we started with a Caesar salad, which we split. The dressing was perfect in flavor, without being overpowering. My husband ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, and he didn't speak for the entire time he ate, which means it was amazing. I ordered the whole Branzini, which is cooked in rock salt, presented for viewing (impressive!), then deboned and served with a light lemon olive oil dressing. This was absolute perfection! Since we were celebrating my birthday, the staff surprised me with a birthday dessert (although I did not order one) and a lively Italian rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\". It was the flourless chocolate cake; never have I tasted a chocolate cake that amazing! For as long as I have known my husband, he has sung the praises of Il Mulino. I am much more of a foodie than he is, so I knew this must be something special if he was so excited about it. He and a friend have made an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas for many years, and one of the biggest reasons is so they can dine at this restaurant together. Finally, I was able to join him! I can't wait until the next trip!! if it was possible to give 6 stars, I would do it.",

    "text": "Every trip to Vegas I build in time for Il Mulino, I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered. The food here is perfect. large portions, cooked to perfection, rich, savory and simply life's finest. The Tortellini soup, Carbonara and flowerless chocolate cake with a fine Italian white wine is a life affirming event.   Yes, it is expensive. Frankly, if you can't afford $100 per person (or much more depending on your wine and drink choice), don't come here. That simple. You have been warned. You get what you pay for. The food is the best but you pay a premium. I believe there is a Maggianos at Fashion Show mall if you want moderate priced blah psudo-Italian food. But remember, it's Vegas, on the strip, at Caesars, everything is expensive.   The service is impeccable. But this is a fine dining establishment, that does mean that there is a bit of institutional arrogance. If you are not accustomed to that, again Maggianos is right down the road.   There are con's here. The wine list is extensive, but even I find it to be a bit lopsided with big Italian reds when not much on the menu supports such belly busters. I would like to see their lighter red and white selection grow. The food is really heavy, and in the summer with 100+ degree heat even at night, it can be a little much to take if you are planning a long walk down the strip.   Both bartenders are top class. I do prefer my Manhattans served up and prefer not to have it shaken to death, but this is picky stuff.   All in all, the best Vegas has to offer.",

    "text": "My husband and I walked in about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and asked for a table for 2.  The hostess was completely thrown that we had just walked in and didn't have a reservation.  As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).    Meanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.  After about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip.",

    "text": "The good part about Il Mulino Italian restaurant is its wonderful location and charming atmosphere! Food is ok, really nothing special! Why? Because it's greasy, oily, heavy handed on sauces and either bland or not sophisticated enough which is not a good place to be considering all the great choices out there when it comes to Italian dining. When seated, the complementary parmiggiano, salami and a few other antipasti is a nice gesture but it's a bit old world and unnecessary if all you expect is exceptional service and cuisine which this place clearly can't provide. Some staff members are better then others especially the ones that are not italian! The ones that are Italian are way to proud of themselves and their attitude is a bit strange and unprofessional! Why? Because    our waiter for some reason had the audacity to grab the payed bill and check it right in front of us as we were still finishing our meal! Pretty embarrassing moment for this restaurant! By the way, I am an American citizen and was born and raised in Italy so for me to criticize the Italian staff isn't easy but I will this time because their attitude and manners is just pathetic. The favorable reviews posted are the reason I wanted to try Il Mulino and now that I have I am a little weary and unsure as to where these reviews are coming from! So, not the worst place in the world with a little luck but I will definitely never step foot here again.",

Don't get me wrong, the food is always prepared and served as ordered and it's absolutely the highest quality.  My only issue was a rude comment the waiter made when one of my guests asked for another piece of parmesan cheese, which is basically a \"no-charge\" appetizer. A few minutes earlier, I had asked for another piece and the waiter cut two smaller pieces and put it on my plate.  When my guest asked for another piece, the waiter said \"I just gave him two\".  It was said rather rudely, not taking into account that it was also on my plate that was used for other appetizers as well.  That being said, the captain and the meal were on point but I don't think the experience was flawless.  Maybe they should have offered a paid option, which we wouldn't have minded.",

It is expensive but we always feel we receive excellent service and delicious food in large portions. (We'll gladly spend the extra $100 on the tab to feel like we were tried like royalty and enjoyed more than enough food.) They never rush guests here too, which is nice. The ambiance is nice too. Of all the restaurants in Vegas to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we chose this one and it did not disappoint.",

    "text": "If you want an honest review of an Italian restaurant ask an Italian...My wife and I have been going to Il Mulino N Y for many years and always look forward to our meal there..We were asked to recommend and book a restaurant for us and two other couples on a recent trip to Las Vegas. we were a bit apprehensive in selecting Il Mulino LV because we had never eaten at that location.....well, we went, and here's my impressions. first of all, let's get this part out of the way.....THE FOOD IS OFF THE CHARTS GOOD...Very authentic Italian, just like Grandpa made for Sunday Dinner....You've read descriptions of the food from other reviewers so I won't go into descriptions of that, suffice it to say, the food is peasant Italian served in a  gourmet style...pay no attention to the nay-sayers..didn't see an Italian name among them... difference between Il Mulino NY and LV atmosphere...NY restaurant has been around for a while and is a bit worn which,I feel, adds to the charm..The wait staff in NY is less stiff, Far more friendly...Back to LV, we were the first to arrived right at 5:00 PM....no big welcome, not even an enthusiastic hello..We ordered cocktails at the bar and enjoyed them on the patio overlooking the strip...No one came to get us when it was time for our reservation so I had to track someone down to take us to our table...Now, I want to regress a bit....I had brought a very good bottle of wine from my cellar to share with my friends....note, I never bring more than one bottle of wine to a restaurant..I walked in with the wine exposed, nothing was said until I went to the Maitre D' and asked that my wine be opened and decanted...he then advised me of their policy of no outside wine..I said sorry I didn't know...he did make an exception and allowed my wine with the understanding that there would be a corkage fee and that I would buy another bottle of wine...all this done in a scolding sort of way saying I should have called first about the wine policy...he's probably right about that but, a little respect....I was probably drinking wine before he was born..I was handed the wine list soon after being seated..I was hard pressed to find a decent wine for under $200.00...did find one but not until after the waiter's strong encourage to up-sell me...corkage fee $40.00, a bit much...all that said, service was great food was real...\"You really need to go\"",

    "text": "Our dinner started out on an impressive note with the yummy appetizers as mentioned by other reviewers--parmesan cheese chunks, thinly sliced fried zucchini, pepperoni, and hearty bread. We had to ask for the balsamic vinegar to mix with the olive oil already on the table. Then the head waiter rattled off a long list of specials for the night (as though we were going to remember any of them. Why not write them on a blackboard or print out a daily special menu?) Since we had reserved for the $50/p prix fixe sunset menu, 4-6PM, all the specials he mentioned didn't apply, and when we told him that, he totally lost interest in us.    There were ample choices on the prix fixe menu, so among 8 of us we ordered mussels, calamari fritti, cannelloni and tasted each others portions. I have to say not one of them stood out. Mussels were not plump and juicy; calamari was not light and crispy; cannelloni was not thin like a crepe. For the main dishes, among us we ordered porcini mushroom ravioli, salmon, steak in marinara sauce. The only happy diner was the one who ordered salmon which was moist on a bed of veggies. The ravioli was doughy and the filling was mushy; the beef was smothered in the sauce and too salty. We also ordered a bottle of red wine for $115 since the \"house wine\" by the glass would have cost $27 according to our waiter. Our bottle was \"decanted\" in a pitcher. I have never seen this done in any fine restaurant. But it went down smoothly and helped make the entrees more palatable. Dessert should have been the piece d' resistance with assortment of tiramisu, cheesecake, and chocolate cake. It came on a plate all mixed together and covered with whipped cream and ice cream--not at all appealing.     In summary, the pasta for the dishes we tasted seemed commercially-made and the sauces were too heavy, nothing like refined Italian cuisine. The dessert looked thrown on the platters. They wouldn't give us separate checks for four couples whereas all the other restaurants did so. On the plus side were the appetizers and the service waiters who were attentive and pleasant. The dining room is also very attractive with low noise level. I wouldn't return to this restaurant as there are so many better ones to choose from, even with the prix fixe menus. Other reviews for this 3 day Las Vegas eating trip to follow.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here during our trip to Vegas and wow I thought that the mustroom black truffle ravioli was to die for! I absolutely loved it.  My hubby's dish was the lobster special and neither of us really cared for it.  The service was excellent though - real attentive, but with the price tag of the place (over $200 for dinner with drinks) I would have been surprised if it had been any other way.  We sat outside and had a nice view of the strip while we enjoyed our meal!",

The cheese is amazing, the chunks of reggiano are fresh and go perfect with the bread and a little red. Ive ordered everything from the sea bass to there pasta and there veal parm is insane. Its on the bone like a rib eye but its veal parm..  Good spot but pricey, recently dined with 9 guest and the bill was just short of 1500.  Buon appetit",

I wanted to try everything that was one the table because it looked so good. I took a few pictures of the desert and diner plates which i never really do. ***** Recommended for everyone! OH and try the Limoncello!",

    "text": "Outstanding. I'm reading some other reviews and scratching my head... I guess any place can have an off night but I can't imagine how you get Il Mulino to one star. A decidedly different experience than the typical LV restaurant in that it's quiet and refined. The service was impeccable and friendly; not condescending in any way shape or form. The food was outstanding in every way, from the appetizers they put on the table before you even look at the menu to the main course and awesome desert. If you think Olive Garden or Carraba's is Italian, don't waste your money here. If you want first rate house made food with awesome service, Il Mulino is for you.",

    "text": "our hotel (ballys)  recommended it..   the restaurant is 'fancy,' has a romantic mood: dim lighting & candles, and also a nice little view.  the waiters were more than willing to serve us, they were so friendly (maybe TOO friendly, they were like flirting with us, it was sometimes uncomfortable).  they all seemed to be \"italian.\"  but my friends and i are pretty sure that some of them were faking the italian accent. (haha)   we all ordered different pasta dishes.  i ordered from their \"specials for the night\" : mushroom and black truffle ravioli..which i couldn't finish, not because there was too much on my plate but because the black truffle was \"how do you say,\" too rich. also my dish cost $50.00.  overall, the food was OKAY, the service was more than great, because they gave us free shots of GRAPPA and LEMON CELLO!!  atmosphere is for couples.  we all had a good time at Il Mulino because the waiters were entertaining us, but other than that.. i don't think I would go back there or recommend it.",
