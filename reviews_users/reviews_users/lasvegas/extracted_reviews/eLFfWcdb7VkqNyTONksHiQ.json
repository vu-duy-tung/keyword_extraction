These guys are AMAZING. I can't express enough how good of a server they are other than that they are the best servers I've had the pleasure in meeting. Eugene made great menu recommendations (e.g. Beef tongue, Gen sauce, etc.). I have never been a fan of beef tounge in my life, but Gen's tongue is my new favorite on the menu. He also hooked me up with chili sauce and their special Gen sauce and i didn't even ask for it. All I told him was that I like their \"salad sauce,\" and BOOM, he's bringing all kinds of amazing sauces out to our table! In conclusion, if you go to Gen, ask for Eugene or Ozzy because I know I will!",

Our waiter could not stop laughing at and teasing us! It was hilarious, stupid and embarrassing but a great time!  Any how-this place was awesome. My friends and I felt it was too cool for the Galleria Mall; it really seemed like a District or Town Square-y joint. Very atmospheric, modernized intimate dining on the second floor of the mall. We also had a 20 minute wait so we left and wandered the mall until they texted me they were ready, which was super convenient. The whole experience from the moment we sat down to the time we finally left was awesome, super fun and just a great time. The meats were all delicious and it was really fun to cook and season your own food and sample the tables' creations.   I think my favorite thing was the squid bulgogi. It was hilarious watching the little white blob curl and quiver on the grill and it tasted absolutely delicious. The jap chae, glass noodles and veggies, was also really yummy, double cooked or not. I wanted to order another serving just to double grill as a joke but my friends are better at being decent adults and convinced me not to. The other fav was the soju; we got pomegranate lychee (you can mix flavors) and it was so delicious that two of us downed a pitcher in about 30 minutes.  All in all, if you're thinking about stopping by or want to try something new and are in the mood for all you can eat, do not pass this place up! It is so amazing and worth every dime!",

Servers are a lot quicker and surprisingly no wait at all on a Sunday afternoon. I tried most of the bulgogi, except the squid bulgogi and my favorite is the spicy pork bulgogi. Serving sizes are much smaller than other kbbq restaurants. Somewhat a good thing, so you can try their different meat selections. I still prefer Doh KBBQ! At that place, you don't come out smelling like smoke after.",

Out server was Ozzy and he was probably the best server I have had at any restaurant. Ever.

The prices here aren't so bad. Quality isn't really that great but you get what you pay for. It's AYCE and I must say major kudos points for having shrimp on their menu! There would be days I would crave meat and seafood but I wouldn't be able to decide where to eat... So in the end, Gen would be my choice! Best of both worlds! Also, you must try their flavored soju! It's amazing~ The service here is okay! I would recommend coming in after 9-10pm when it isn't so busy so that the servers could focus more on you and your table. I can't imagine how lunch and dinner is though! I'm sure it's really busy. Yikes. Anyways, I would totally recommend this place to anyone. 5 stars!",

I was a little disappointed though, I understand they just opened so they're still working everything out, but I was really excited for the rice paper, and they don't have any at this location!   We got the gyoza and it was mediocre. When we went for dinner the only menu item they didn't have was the Cajun fries. The meat is just okay, I think the meat in California is MUCH better.   I was actually impressed by the service though, everyone was really nice and extremely attentive.   I'd go back again in a few months once they work out the kinks, hopefully they have rice paper by then!",

When we arrived the hostess told us it was going to be a 45 minute wait. But we only waited 20minutes upon being seated.  Everything here is amazing. The service, food , ambiance. There wasn't one thing I ate that disappointed me.  We ordered almost everything on the menu so I can't go through everything. But let me just tell you, YOU CAN GO WRONG WITH ANYTHING! But the items that stood out to me was the \"roast beef\", kalbi, and the Cajun shrimp! (Cajun shrimp is spicy, juicy, just mouthwatering burst of flavor!)   At the end we got a green tea macaroon And coffee macaroon ice cream. Although it was BRICK hard when it was served to us, we let it sit on a plate ONTOP of the warm stovetop to let it thaw out for 5minutes. It was a perfect ending to our dinner.   I will be back!!! Even though it's a long ass drive.. It's totally worth the drive and wait!",

It's honestly is annoying and a nuisance when you have to tell your Server that you want more water, but not with JR. Also, Josh was a great Food Runner. He was very nice, energetic, professional, and he made great recommendations for other dishes for me to try out. Let's just say the Beef Bulgogi was delicious.

First off, we got plastic spoons when I asked for cutlery. Was told some story about guests stealing cutlery so they had run out. Then service was horrible! Started off ok, but went downhill. Waited over 20 mins for a bowl of rice. Asked for things that never got to out table. All the while, saw the waiter serving and chatting with other people. Ended up asking a runner to bring us rice. By this time, all the food was burnt or cold. We had lost our appetite. End of the meal, asked for the check, twice. Took an extra 5+ minutes to get that. The food was still good, hence the two stars. Service was just so bad.",

All the meat they have to offer is nothing special. They give tiny portions so you have to keep ordering. There is no dessert included.  Returned here about 2 months after I wrote this post and they took away the crispy calamari!! The best thing on the menu. Kind of bummed about that. I tried something called a spicy Korean rice cake. It was different. I liked the texture but not the sweet and spicy sauce on top of it. I noticed that they do have a macaroon machine out front now but it's an extra charge! Come on now! They could just include dessert for the high cost of the AYCE?   Honestly, this is place is nothing special, I'd rather eat at Doh.",

We went during lunch and the price for the all you can eat option was about $16 bucks which I think is pretty fair. There were a lot of meat options for lunch. Only 3 to 4 items were restricted for dinner. Something I really like with my Korean BBQ is steamed egg and pickled radish which they didn't have. We also had to request for sesame oil, salt and pepper which I like with my pork belly.   The service was good. I wasn't sure exactly who our server was though, there we're many people helping us.

Pros:  -$20/person for dinner AYCE (includes appetizers) -they change the grill plate like every 2 different meats -meat was fresh -service was fantastic -don't have to go to china town to get KBBQ  Cons: -Tori (one of the hostess) was SO incredibly rude. I gave her $60 for a $43 bill and when I told her I needed change, I got the worst b*tch face ever. What?! $17 tip? Rude.",

    "text": "We've been coming to this location at least once a week every week since they opened and we've never had a bad word to say about it ... Until now. As soon as we walked in we could tell that something major had changed and I'm not talking about decor or menu or anything like that. For the first time that we have ever seen, the staff looked defeated and exhausted. We've been here when it was so busy that there was a three hour wait and we've never seen them lose their pep and spark like this. We tried to inquire with staff about what had changed and got polite professional apologies but no one would dish the goods on what had happened so we checked in with a few former employees and learned that there have been major changes in management and it's clear that this is the reason for the polar opposite experience of what we're used to here. Don't get me wrong, everyone was still polite friendly and attentive but obviously very short staffed. Shea was our server and she was at the top of her game! Probably her best performance to date. Still smiling, still remembered everything, still taking the time to thank every table for coming in as they were on their way out after finishing their meals. Really exceptional job. Lauren was another super power keeping things going. She was bussing tables, making drinks, answering random questions at the front, smiling and greeting every customer that she came near, and pepping up the morale. I'm not going to lower my star rating yet because 2+ years is far too long to give up on this place so easily. We'll be back but we really hope things get back on track quickly because we'd hate to lose this weekly tradition over management changes. We thought Carlos was doing an excellent job. When he took over for Eugene we really never noticed any issues like we're seeing now and the changes we did see we liked. We'd love to see him back in charge again.",

    "text": "The hype was so real when Gen first opened, and with good reason. The selection of korean bbq restaurants in Las Vegas is mediocre at best. Hailing from sunny California, Gen decided to grace Sin City with its presence. I have dined there a few times and found it to be better than any other AYCE KBBQ spot in Las Vegas.  LOCATION/AMBIENCE Its main drawback is location, which is pretty much ACROSS TOWN from most people. However, I am willing to bet all the Henderson and east side folks are happy they no longer have to travel to Chinatown.   The restaurant is HUGE and very modern. There is ample seating and weird glowy lights and random shows playing on the screen. Looks more like a lounge than a restaurant. Since the place is so large, we never have to wait very long to be seated (or am I just lucky?)  Since it's located at Galleria Mall, parking is easy and plentiful.  FOOD The selection of meats is fairly standard so I won't go over every little thing. However, marinated thick cuts of pork belly, pork jowl, and large sections of tripe, which I all love, are quite rare in Las Vegas. For that I am thankful. The standouts are definitely the pork jowl, miso pork belly, and smoked garlic pork belly for me. I just love pork belly.   Beef tongue is also good but beef brisket is sliced waaay too thin, causing it to just fall apart upon cooking.   The appetizer and banchan selection is average. My favorites are the potato salad, salad, and thin radish for wrapping.  SERVICE The other drawback of Gen is its service, which is extremely inconsistent. Some employees are obviously inexperienced or just not motivated to work quickly and efficiently. In addition, there seems to be no organization, as you will be asked the same question multiple times by different people but end up waiting 20 minutes for a plate of meat and somehow receive 2 items you did not even order.  VALUE At 14.99 for weekday lunch and 19.99 for weekday dinner and all day weekend, Gen is very much worth the price. Just make sure you have ample time allotted to compensate for cooking, driving, and slow service. Overall meat quality is average but you get what you pay for!  Tips: - Request for oil on the grill to prevent sticking (why don't they do this already?) - You can request sesame oil and salt for dipping.  Yelp 100 Challenge - 2016 [5/100]",

    "text": "6 super hungry friends at an all you can eat Korean BBQ during a holiday lunch rush and one insanely busy (yet somehow organized) waiter named Ozzy! We literally ordered everything off of the menu that was available for lunch, which only excluded beef tongue and maybe one or two other items. Lunch also includes all you can eat appetizers for $15.99 per person!  Let me begin by saying that the table booths are a little cramped for 6 adults but we managed to sit elbow to elbow without too much of an issue. Once seated, we took inventory of the small bowls of sample-sized extras that surrounded the in-table circular grill and quickly received our drinks without hardly any wait time. (THANK YOU OZZY!!) Ozzy gave great explanations of everything on the menu and was attentive to some dietary needs we had, while maintaining a sincere smile and positive attitude. This means a lot in today's food service industry.  Our only problem presented itself when the food started arriving. The grill, extra sides, drinks and our place settings left hardly any room on the table for our food! It was like playing Jenga with dishes of meat and vegetables. It was then that Ozzy informed us that we could place items on the high shelf close to the wall if we were out of room. There is a pretty good amount of room up on that shelf, but it is awkward because it sits pretty far above your head and you have to stand up to see what you have placed on it. Without that shelf, there is no way we would have been able to fit all of the plates in our eating space.  We were SO pleased with the quality of the beef, chicken, pork and seafood that came out of the kitchen. The brisket was beautifully marbled, bright red, sliced super thin and absolutely melted in my mouth. The seafood was not slimy at all, which gives me confidence in rating the freshness of their ingredients. We went through maybe 8 plates of the brisket, 4 plates of calamari, 3 orders of KFC (yummy!), 4 plates of chicken, 2 plates of pork, 3 plates of shrimp and one plate of the volcano chicken along with lots of fresh veggies, pickled veggies and kimchi. You also get unlimited rice with your meal. Our favorite appetizer was definitely the fried rice sticks but the veggie dumplings are great, too! After a couple of pitchers of Sapporo and a TON of dirty plates, we finally hit our limit.  There are 3 minor complaints that I would give these guys - 1. The lack of larger tables for larger groups (just get 2 tables if you have a group larger than 4 to avoid our issue) 2. The restaurant itself is rather dark and people on one side of the table (away from the window light) had difficulty reading their menu. This is nothing a commercial lighting redo wouldn't address, however. 3. The wait staff is paid in a tip pool and are required to split their tips. Now this may seem fair from a customer perspective, but when you work as hard as Ozzy does side-by-side next to a low-energy, non-motivated waiter (who will remain unnamed), the problem becomes clear. Please, Gen, consider giving incentive and recognition to your hard-working wait staff on a regular basis! They SUPER deserve it!  I am giving Gen a 4/5 because of the 3 issues above. The food quality is amazing and is absolutely deserving of 4 stars. I would also say that the grill doesn't really get hot enough to sear the fat on the thicker-cut pork belly the way I like it, but this may just be personal preference. Maybe cut the pork belly a little thinner to combat this. Clean plates, cups and silverware and the overall restaurant seemed well maintained. I cannot attest to the cleanliness of the restroom because I did not use it. I also did not partake in any of the drinks over at the small bar they have.  Highly recommended and I will most certainly be back, with friends!",

The food selection... hands down... can't be beaten. Not sure why people like Gangnam bec. quality of food there and service sucks... they should go to this place instead.   Our server was Jessica and she was very friendly, polite, and very efficient. They had calamari, shrimp, squid, baby octopus as part of their all you can eat Bbq (yehay!!! If you're pescetarian). Their side dishes were very good too. I think we had 8 side dishes plus a bowl of salad, japchae, and radish wraps! It was really yummy!  The wait time, even though they were busy, wasn't so bad. Also, the ventilation of the place is good... we didn't end up smelling so badly like we've been soaking in Korean Bbq smoke.  Also... you can't beat $20 for the quality of service, selections of meat, in all of Vegas. The only con would probably be the fact that dessert is not included but that's a very minor con.",

However, we got seated quickly to a table! Once sitting down, our server NATASHA greeted us with such a great personality. We had to told her we were visiting from California so she went over the menu since our menus are a bit different. Natasha was very attentive, offering us refills, getting us all the small items quickly. She brought us sufficient rice paper, unlike our California locations who never have any or bring such a tiny amount. We were extremely satisfied having her as our server. Now as for the meats , the quality of it WOWED us! All of the meats were fresh and not too much fattening on them. The spicy bulgogi was actually spicy (yum), the glass noodles and Gyoza were amazing. In the 4 locations in California we have been to, we do not have Gyoza sadly. Overall, this place was amazing! Their staff are hard hard working and fast people and the owner is doing a great job with this location. The quality of meats and his workers are what keeps this place great. Hopefully on our next vacation to Vegas, we get to come to this location and have Natasha as our server. This Gen's location deserves a great yelp review!",

    "text": "After hearing about Gen from friends I'm southern California, I was so excited to see one open here in Vegas! A late lunch last Friday was a great time to try the place out. We got there around 3 and it was pretty empty - it is a big place to be honest.  After asking us if we'd eaten there before, our drink orders were taken and we were brought the sides typical of kbbq. The salad dressing, a nice vinaigrette with a hint of Asian flavor, was just phenomenal to me, I ate about two plates just to myself.  We started with steamed edamame and sesame chicken. I had to ask about three times to finally get the edamame. Luckily I had my salad.  The first meats we ordered were the signature steak, beef tongue, spicy chicken (one friend loves spicy) and small intestine (one other friend loves that). I didn't get any of the steak, but it looked great and my friends said it was awesome. I'll definitely make sure I get some next time I'm here for dinner. The beef tongue was good here, not too chewy.  Next we got the chicken bulgogi, pork belly, and the brisket, a go-to meat that never disappoints. Both types of chicken here aren't the easiest to cook if you don't use the scissor provided to cut them up first; some pieces are pretty big and won't cook through quickly and there was a decent bit of fat on some of our bulgogi. I don't care for pork belly, the but the two big slices looked really nice and my friend said they were quite good. The brisket, given to us in GIANT slices, was really delicious. The marbling was great and there weren't like huge parts that were just fat which I liked.  I think my favorite thing about the meats here were the portions - sometimes at kbbq, the plates of raw meat are so big that its hard to be able to try a variety before getting too full, but Gen's plates were nice and small, allowing us to try more things and never get stuck with too much to eat in order to leave no waste.  Before I was done, I wanted another small bowl of edamame. Again, I had to ask three times. The second time I asked if it was on the way, I considered saying nevermind, and I wish I had - this bowl was overcooked and pretty much every piece was soggy, mushy, and full of regret and sadness.  Besides the edamame being forgotten both times, the service was great. Every server was polite and I never felt like I was being annoying asking about the edamame. The food was really delicious. I can't wait to try this place again, either this one when I'm in town for another weekend or a so cal location the next time I'm in LA.",

They did not have any gochujang. I wanted to make some bibimbap.   Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4 stars  They were attentive. They replaced our grill when needs to be changed. Checked on us when our plates were looking empty. Friendly service!  Would I come here again? Maybe, if I was shopping at the Galleria mall.",

    "text": "First of all, this was not my first visit to Gen but hands down THE BEST.  I enjoyed a late lunch with my Fiance and our server, Alodia, was the best. Truly the kind of person I love to see in the service industry. Bright, cheerful, and had a good sense of humor. She also made great recommendations. It's safe to say that she is one server who truly cares about our job. Sadly, I don't understand why she is not in a position of management here? Her skills would truly serve the restraint well.   Anyways, we enjoyed a couple servings of brisket, bugolgi, tongue, and shrimp. Everything was delicious and perfectly cut and prepared all thanks to Chef Carlos! Really nice man who I met previously at a visit to Gen.   Fine cuts of meat, excellent service and a good vibe. Can't complain!",

    "text": "TL DR: It's worth the price because you're paying for the kbbq experience and distance if you live in Henderson.   So the service has always been wishy Washy for me. Some days it'll be on point. We get more than one drink refill and will be asked a good amount of times for meat orders. Other days I'll get one round and half of my appetizers before I feel full feel waiting for the waiter to order again. Ozzy and I think her name was Jessica. They were always attentive and I think for being the only kbbq spot I know In Henderson. I'm happy with what is here.   The four stars is for the iffy service, and the fact their bathroom floors are always sticky. I know you're busy .. But I like leaving a restaurant without worrying if my flip flop will want to stick around when I walk out.   Briskey, pork belly, steak, beef tongue, and roast beef are some of my faves !   Lord help me I think I first wrote this review half asleep, sorry for my elementary writing!",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a second chance because... I'm a very forgiving person. Mainly, hungry, but I'm forgiving too. I dragged along my brother and cousin (everyone needs a sidekick) while my five-year-old was in school. They've always wanted to try it, and so I saw that this was my opportunity to see if my first impression on this place still stands.  Remember last time I told you all that their brisket was very chewy and ew? Not this time! It was definitely melt-in-your-mouth goodness this time around! I fell in love with it so bad that I we ordered SIX of these babies. You heard (err... READ) me right! I said SIX! My brother wanted to try the bulgogi, so he ordered beef and pork bulgogi. Yo.. The pork bulgogi WINS everything! It was so damn delicious. I don't know what it was, but this is definitely the best bulgogi that I've ever had. The beef was pretty good too, but I'd order the pork over the beef all day, err' day!   Service was the same as last time. We had an attentive server. I don't know her name because either A). I forgot her name or B). she never gave it to us. She was cool, though. Let me tell you what WON my little visit there. It's the fact that they were playing old school hits. No, not Stevie Wonder or BeeGees. But I'm talking about old R&B songs from the early 2000s (i.e. Dilemma by Nelly ft. Kelly Rowland). My brother straight up told me, \"It's like they stole your (first generation) iPod and plugged it in.\" I was really feelin' myself when we were eating there. I wanted to stay just for the music.  I don't know if they changed their little SH*T \"EVERYONE AT THE TABLE MUST PAY FOR AYCE EVEN IF IT'S JUST TWO PEOPLE EATING IT\" RULE because my entire little posse and I all ordered AYCE lunch. That's why I didn't give them 5 STARS.   Definitely will be back here even though it takes 30 damn minutes just to get here -- I live in Northwest Vegas, y'all.",

If you have to wait, you can just stroll the mall and they'll send you an alert when your table is ready so that's convenient.   The place is very modern and it has a nice setting. The staff is nice but waiting for food when you order a certain amount at a time can get slow at times. That's why I suggest getting all you want to eat at the start.  Also, there's no smoke that will get in your face while you're cooking so that's an A+ from me!",

We ordered A LOT and the food came out very quickly. Zach regularly checked on us and made sure we were taken care of, and at the end of the meal my mom and her sisters were very impressed by his professionalism.  Great food. Amazing service.

You have a 2 hour limit, but I doubt you can enjoy this food for sooo long. We got the mushroom and vegetable dish which was 4 pieces of cut mushroom and 5 pieces of zucchini cut small and the rest of the plate was chopped onion! Seafood was very disappointing and meat was not fresh, plus it had aftertaste! My husband loves Korean BBQ but this place made him so disappointed! And you get cold rice))))",

    "text": "Prior to departing for our vacation, I found an online coupon for $20 off a $40 purchase at this recently opened chain restaurant, but noticed it was subsequently taken down so my wife called to confirm that we could use it.  Our AYCE meal included unlimited appetizers, meats, seafood and banchan (small side dishes).   We started off with a mundane and unnecessary order of gyoza. This was followed by orders of signature steak, Cajun shrimp and spicy chicken that we cooked on the grill.  The grill was replaced a few times and we ended up ordering just 2 more proteins, though I don't remember either.   The food was good, but there was a sameness to our second order since many of the proteins are marinated in the same ingredients.   When I went to settle the bill, our waiter said he did not think our coupon would be accepted, but he would check with the manager.  Once he returned and told us it would not be accepted, I asked him to send the manager over who reiterated that only a hard copy of the coupon would be accepted and not one printed off the Zip Code Magazine website.  The obvious question that he could not explain was how does the consumer know that some coupons (originals from the magazine) would be accepted while those printed off the website would not?  He said he would confirm the policy with the main office, but I seriously doubt anyone was working at 8PM on a Monday night. Instead he just scrawled out a hand written note of apology reiterating their (his?) policy.  I decided he was anal retentive and would not budge so I just paid full price.",

    "text": "Started going here when it first opened and loved it. But our last visit was just a horrible experience, one thing after another.   We were told to wait 20 minutes at first, then told to wait 30, which is no problem. We ended up waiting for an hour, which we also didn't mind because it was Sunday night but when we arrived it was empty and by the end of our wait, we've seen multiples parties with groups as large as ours get seated before us.   We were then told that our party of 8 was going to be spilt into 2 tables back to back. After waiting an hour we weren't just going to walk out. 2 tables next to each other opened up and we asked to be sat there. The hostess said \"ok, let me check for you.\" We wait another 15 minutes on top of the hour that was originally supposed to only be 20 minutes, only to be sat at 2 tables, back to back. Meanwhile, one of the other 2 tables that were next to each other was given to a party of 7 that showed up after us.  Already upset about this, the table that 4 of us were sitting at started leaking in the ceiling above the table (it was raining out). So now that half of the group had to move to a table even further from the other half.   We saw our server twice, three times maybe. We ended up ordering the majority of our food from the runners who were dropping off our orders or cleaning the table.   We chose your restaurant as a going away celebration for a friend moving to another country and now instead of spending it with 7 friends, the going away celebration was spent with just 3. No free meals or free desserts are being seeked for compensation. The plans along with the night have already been ruined. As a last get together for a friend, this is what the 8 of us will remember.  The only reason why I even gave 2 stars is because the food was delicious.",

Food is delicious and they don't give you big portions so you can try more! Ventilation is great here and the place is very modernized.  When I came here with only one other person, we were sat at a very tall and long table with two other grills. This table is meant to sit multiple small parties. Although, the atmosphere is loud, it feels a little awkward hearing the people next to you have their own conversation.  The only real down side is the payment method. When I came with a party of six, we were not told until after we were done eating, that the cashier can only do up three cards. When I was here with just my sister, we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us out. Even with that, the cashier didn't even apologize for making us wait that long. Both times, the cashier asks if you want to leave a tip which is always pressuring and a bit annoying. Come here for good kbbq, but expect to have to wait for seating and paying.",

My wife was in the area and my daughter said her and a friend had gone for Korean bbq ( another establishment ) and had really enjoyed it so they invited me down to join them at Gen, what a mistake.   Approx 45 min wait which for a popular place is to be expected, but the clubby music should have been a sign of all the soul (Seoul) that was missing from this 'restaurant.'   We waited for quite a bit for our waiter to find his way out of the weeds and over to our table, whereupon we ordered drinks one of which was a hot green tea. You guessed it, said tea never arrived, although we did get a cup of Lipton and later an attempted delivery of an iced green tea from the manager.   The meats came out quickly, but the vegetables we ordered only arrived after the waiter again made his way to us after the meats were pretty well done and consumed.    He again made his way back to let us know he was leaving should we need anything else, lol, there'd be someone else taking care , again lol, of us.   The new waiter stopped by to say he'd be taking over and I again mentioned the tea and the fact that the veggies came out so late. He said the other waiter had been busy with a large party so...  This is when the Mgr came by with the iced tea, and again said the waiter had been busy,( isn't this what you want as a server? I know I did when I was a waiter.) so we said thanks for stopping by but the experience was beyond salvaging at this point.   Our new server passed by our cleared table numerous times over the next 15 minutes w/o making eye contact or bringing us our bill to end our suffering.   We finally went back to the hostess stand asked for our bill and lo and behold they were still charging us for the tea we never received. Told em we wouldn't be back with the Mgr right there. No response was the response.   Long story short, don't do it and at $20 per plus drinks, it just ain't worth it.",

Food was great!  It's a bummer they don't have the steamed egg , bean paste soup , or the agadashi tofu that my friend wanted me to try. However they did have some bomb ass japchae( glass noodles) omg shout out to Carlos (the chef) for that. We had to order that twice it was so good! All the meats seemed fresh & well marinated. I like how the pork belly we ordered was thinly sliced & not too thick like most places. I like to eat all my food spicy so Adonia(our server) brought out the \"volcano sauce\" for me to try & that was so good too! I dipped all my meat in it. Service was on point & staff was attentive. U guys need a location  closer to the southwest side though please!",

The food is really good and will satisfy everyone as long as they eat meat. They also serve you a good salad that reminds me of the lettuce wraps from PF Chang's. I have eaten here 5 times now and it is one of my go to restaurants. I like the vibe of the restaurant too with the neon lighted booths and how everyone shouts Gen! When someone walks into the restaurant. Servers can be hit or miss, I have had great ones who are on top of things and ok ones that forget about you. You will probably have to wait to get seated but it is worth it. I'm glad I was able to find a good Korean BBQ place here in town.",

Always tender, thinly sliced, and oh so great.  It's not thick and chewy like most other AYCE spots. Their Banchan (side dishes) are the best!  Good variety  and seasoned well. Although they did do away with their spicy rice cake which was one of my favorites as well.    Another thing to appreciate is their well mannered and friendly servers. There's not many places where for the most part the entire staff has a great attitude and always makes you feel welcomed. Natasha is our favorite server, always on point and friendly.  The rest of the crew is just as great  GEN never disappoints, 5 stars well deserved.",

We were getting ignored most of the time but every time the couple next to us wanted to order they were serviced right away.  The second time was fairly recent (late birthday dinner).

I'm not Korean but if you brought a Korean person here I bet they would say the same. The service is great, they have one server to take your orders and an army of other people to march over to your table with the meats  you never have to wait long to get your raw meats.   I wish they had just a little bit more selection on the meats (I heard the Cali locations have more?) but otherwise the service is great. Their building had some issues with AC when it was 100+ outside but hopefully it's fixed.  I also appreciate the ventilation that's built in to the table. It's quiet and does a good job. You don't go home smelling like what you ate like in some other places.  If you need a quick Korean bbq fix and service with a smile, this is the place for it. I would just push the side dishes aside.",

The bulgogi is tasty, but you need to order multiple orders, as the portions seemed too small for 2 to share. The spicy pork, again was tasty, as was the Dakgogi (chicken).  The banchan is only kimchi, oi kimchi(cucumber), radish & mashed potato(??? Must be for folks who dont usually eat korean)  They do have some beer & wine. The iced green tea is very good.

I've been to the one in Rancho Cucamonga and Northridge and both had way better service with my party. I mean come one this is the one that most people go to in LA.  It's known for some good quality meat and service. It wasn't crazy busy but yes it was busy. But you think that with a huge party you would get more meat. It sucked because we had to call the waiter many times just to feed our party.   I do like the quality of the meat and the bonchon was great. But small portion for a party of 8 adults is ridiculous. I'll try this place one more time and hopefully it won't be small portions for my huge party.",

Also cannot complain about the playlist; they've always got 2000's hip hop and r&b hits to set the mood right.   If you saved enough room for dessert, they also have macaroon ice cream!

    "text": "The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because the food was good. The service experience on the other hand was awful.  1. When I called to make a reservation, I was told they don't normally do that but in my case they would make an exception. Funny how I received an automated text message an hour before our reservation time - not to mention when my party arrived, a hostess told me there was a mix-up with reservations so we would have to wait 30 mins. for 3 tables. Although, she suggested we could sit at 2 tables and used a tablet to show me the seating arrangements. (Gee, I thought they made an exception for our reservation...)  2. 9 people around 2 tables is not a good idea, especially when the staff doesn't keep the tables clean. We had to play Jenga with our plates and bowls ultimately having to ask for the table to be cleared. One server started to reach for one of the stacks at our table at the same time someone was putting food on the grill. The server then walked away without clearing anything from the table.  3. Due to the very limited space around us, one individual knocked her glass over and it broke spilling her drink every where. We asked for help to clean it and all we got was some napkins. No one bothered to help us clean the glass. I had to pick up all the chards and use what napkins we had to clean up the spill, plus I had to deal with the fact the drink was spilled all over me. The sauce tray was ruined and of course no one brought me a replacement.  4. They can bring beer out by the pitcher full and they have a fancy table dispenser that takes up a lot of room on the table as well. For those of us who wanted soda or water, we had to ask for refills MULTIPLE times.  5. One grill was replaced without question. The other, we had to ask multiple times for it to be replaced. When the first grill needed to be replaced a second time, the server questioned it as it it were a complicated task. There 5 people cooking on that one grill so what did the he expect?!  6. We were largely ignored by the staff group, yet they tacked on 18% gratuity - not a single dime of which was earned at our table. I observed the staff coming and going at other tables, yet we had to wait and wait for them to show up. When we made requests, they either forgot or it took a ridiculous amount of time before they showed up with what we asked for. However there were a couple times they brought food out that we hadn't asked for but, left before we could say anything.  Honestly, this could have been such an awesome experience. It's a shame the servers lack any real professionalism and they clearly don't care about the customer experience. Paying as much as we were charged should have come with a much more positive experience. That's the whole point of going to restaurants like this, but this place missed the mark big time.",

Make sure you try the KFC & Gyoza some of my favourite side dishes. The KFC is a bit spicy but it's definitely worth it! The service is always amazing and the staff is extremely friendly and polite. It's $20.99 for dinner and on weekends and $15.99 for lunch Monday-Friday. There are over 30 items to choose from too. Great selection in meats and sides!  OH ANOTHER THING...

    "text": "I have been to Gen about five times and although it is a great deal, about $20 all you can eat per person, there are cons to these pros.  When you walk inside you are met with the aroma of cooking meat, sizzling sound everywhere, lots of people talking, and the modern interior. I personally like the hustle and bustle aspect of the restaurant.   Every time I have went I did have to wait about 5-10 minutes each time because it always seems to be busy every night. My favorite place to sit is in the booth, there seems to be more table room which is handy since you'll have plates everywhere. The food selection is fairly large. Mainly just meats and the sides tend to be rice. The food is good if you can cook it right. I do feel sick a little after though, but that's because I try to stuff as much as I can into my stomach.  The service is where the cons come in. There are a lot of young people working and they aren't as friendly and excited to serve you as compared to other restaurants. They are very forgetful as well. I should not have to ask for another bowl of rice three times. Also they never seem to remember what drink you had. The service isn't completely terrible but I have had better. Another annoyance is that they always try to give us someone else's food at least three times a sitting.   The atmosphere, good. The food, good. The service, eh.",

Eat dish is seasoned with it's own spices and herbs which come out smelling savory and appetizing, unlike other places that use the same seasoning for all dishes.  The chicken KFC are one of my favourites.  The chicken are seasoned with a spicy seasoning and done just right, with the skin a bit crispy and the meat juicy which makes for a heavenly delight.  The glazed pork and chicken are also very delectable and mouthwatering.  All the flavor is kept in while grilling and goes well with a cold drink.  One of my new favorites is the  grilled chinese buns with condensed milk to make it something of a dessert.    Julian is Very Hard Working Server and Serve us Right and Very Respectful.",

The grill is circular and frequently burns requiring even more frequent grill changes causing delays in cooking and therefore breaks during eating.   I prefer Hobak on spring mountain. It might not be ayce but service and quality are both top notch. Additionally the sides are wonderful and they have steam egg (not offered at gen)",

    "text": "This place is really not bad at all. I usually have Korean barbecue on the west coast. That is where I originally tried it out the first time years ago even though of course there are Korean BBQ places all over.   Las Vegas is a place I do not go to very often. But it was the second time I have been in the area and someone whom I know was kind enough to show me a great place he had already eaten twice at (within the span of two weeks ) previously.   The premise of Korean barbecue is that you basically pay to cook your own food. But it is the price and experience that being people to come back to places like this. The menu of meat is extensive at most restaurants. This was no different. There is a lunch special during the week for all you can eat but the price is different during the weekend.   The place has a good energy and modern fusion look in the decor. Many tables with booth style seating ( what we were offered ) or a large sit down bar area. The wait was not too long as there were five in our group. As soon as we were seated the hostess let us know that even though it was lunch time, the dinner price was what was available during the weekend. It was still a good deal for the amount of food we ended up ordering. The different in price was approximately $5 but there was a reason why our friends ate here at least twice ( which they normally would not ).   The banchan put out and our server let us know the special appetizers that were available. Popcorn chicken, Korean fried chicken ( which is touted as the new KFC ) spicy pork bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chadol, steak, chicken bulgogi and some bovine intestine (gobchang). The last dish everyone politely declined to try.   Dessert options. While waiting for a table at the beginning I noticed a large waist height display freezer full of macrons. But these were not regular dessert macrons. They were filled with ice cream. Four main flavors were available but I only ordered while another one in our party decided to try one. I decided to get the mango and chocolate flavor.    There is a good assortment of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I did not partake but they have both sake, soju, wine and different beers.   Overall service was excellent. They were attentive and even took time to explain that we were able to adjust the heat for cooking. This was important as some meats required more or less heat.   They accommodated babies but I did not like that the baby chair was on the outside of the booth. Customers and employees kept walking by and out of curiosity there were many attempts to grab the food as it was put on the table. But there were no issues and the employees were careful.   They separated the bill for each person which made my group happy. This is a spot I would not mind visiting again.",

You can order lunch or dinner during lunch time I guess to get the extra items that aren't offered on the lunch menu but you can't order lunch for dinner I guess. The brisket is raved about here on Yelp a lot but I guess it left more to be desired as neither of us liked it very much. You cook your own food of course but the KFC comes cooked already and is delicious! Definitely recommended.",

Service is good, BUT even though we told the server we had never been there before and needed a little advice...none was forthcoming.    With a little trial and error we caught on to cooking times and technique.  The biggest problem was, at first, the grille was turned down really, really low so it took forever for anything to cook.   Another table noticed our frustration and suggested we tell the bus person who immediately figured out the problem.  After that is was pretty smooth sailing.   The only reason the trip to Gen doesn't get five stars is the lack of instructions re: the cooking time issue.  Okay, your thinking, \"How difficult is it to figure out how to cook chicken,  pork,  beef, etc?\" And right you are!   However, whole baby octopus, whole calamari?   A little less obvious!  The green ice tea was great.",

    "text": "i guess this place is a hit and miss when it comes to service depending on which server you get. The very last time I was here I was so disappointed with the service. First our server was a female and she was nice and after our first order she told us she's clocking out and that we are going to have a new server (she mentioned his name but I couldnt remember because this guy never introduced himself nor tried to serve us) and then I noticed this server that's serving the table next to us, which by the way had the same female server that finished her shift, so I assumed that this guy is our server too. But we kinda waited and he never approached us and he kept serving the other table asking them if they need something else, so my bf called him and asked we could have some more of the sauce (or dip) the server is polite and all, but he never came back with the sauce, and he brought more food to the next table, so we called him again to order more food and to ask for that sauce again, and he did come back with everything we asked for, but after that he never approached us again, he kept passing by and serving the other table but never once asked us if we need something else, when we needed a new grilling pan we had to call him again just so we would get help, and this is how it was the whole time, never once did he try to actually serve us, at this point I was so mad I was close to going to the front desk to ask who really is our server, although I know it's gotta be this guy orelse someone else would have already approached us. We still tipped accordingly out of respect but honestly I didn't wanna go back here after that night.. I don't know.. Maybe I will get a better service next time.. But im still very disappointed.",

I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the Hawaiian steak on the menu and the steamed egg. The kalbi meat was a little tough something that I'm not used to. Otherwise, the brisket and the Gen steak was really good.  Service was good, our waitress Janecia was really personable and talked quite a bit to us.  Julius was great, he came by and changed out the grill and restarted the fire for us after I turned it off.",

When it came time to pay, she charged another gratuity on top of the one included in the bill.  When I pointed this out to her, all I got was the deer in the headlight look.  I had to go through the math with her to show she charged the gratuity twice.  It ended up being almost a 41% gratuity she tried to charge me.  The manager wasn't any help either and kept making excuses why they couldn't reverse the credit card transaction.  This problem took 20 minutes to sort out because of their incompetency.  The food was good but since the opening a few weeks ago, they have definitely reduced the size of their portions.  I know it is AYCE but some items take awhile to come out. The delay perhaps strategically causes you to eat less.  In summary, if you ever get the hostess (not the asian one) with a party of 6 or more, ask her what the total is BEFORE she runs your card.",

    "text": "I am from Los Angeles and Gen KBBQ is AMAZING out there. They crack jokes, get to know you, suggest different plates, they make you feel apart of the family. I've been to this location twice and both experiences were ridiculous. Tonight's experiences was definitely my last.   First experience:  - Host was rude. Didn't greet me. Looked at me and turned to the other host and continued to chit chat about weekend plans.  - Waiter was MIA. The entire time. When he was there, he was so slow. I received more help from the busser than I did with him. Went back there to find him since the grill was so charred and I just saw him chatting with another waiter. Sweet.   Second experience:  - Host was rude, again. Same host from the first experience. No surprise there. But this time she was conversing with a guy. I assume he was a manager because he was wearing an Affliction shirt and not a black button up. Go figure.  - Poor waiter, he was so busy with 5+ different tables with larger groups. Had to ask multiple different bussers for water, extra meat, napkins, etc. before I even received anything. Within 1 hour, I asked 3 bussers + my waiter for extra meat and only received assistance once with a partial order.  - Bartender was standing behind the bar singing and laughing with absolutely no customers on that side of the restaurant. Might've been helpful to utilize her assisting customers rather than chatting and singing Adele at the top of her lungs.  - The manager came over and I thought that he was coming to check in since I had continually asked the bussers and the waiter for multiple things. Nope. He came to pick up the dishes and ask for the menu. Didn't even get a \"hi, how are you?\" SMH.   When will people understand that customers are what drive your business. Not having your staff mopping and cleaning 20 minutes prior to closing time.   Here's some advice, save your money and go to Tofu Hut haha. They may not have the 90s playlist or flashing neon lights, but at least someone will greet you and serve you food. You can get Korean BBQ anywhere. But without a focus on driving your business and creating loyal customers, you'll never get anywhere.   Gen isn't on the strip, so tourists aren't even easily accessible to them. We are locals and we are your target audience. A lesson in customer service and effective management would greatly benefit this location. Smh.",

Favorite things were ordered were the Kalbi and the chadol, pretty standard choices at Korean BBQ. If they had soup options like the steamed egg or jjigae I might have given an extra star. Overall it's slightly above average, I'll give them a few months to iron out the kinks before I give them another try.",

No.  Are the servers/bartenders the best in Vegas? No.  But this isn't some high end Vegas strip joint.  This is a restaurant outside the Galleria mall.  And let me tell you, it's worth every penny.  There is a considerably large selection of meats you can choose from for $20!  We happen to go here by mistake.  We intended to go to the steakhouse next door but this caught our eye and we lucked out.  My wife made me eat the baby octopus.  It did not taste like chicken, I repeat IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CHICKEN.  Whoever tells you that is full of it.  But it was good.  The meat portions aren't huge, which is good because you'll want to sample a lot of them.  And you really won't be able to try them all in a single visit.  You do all the cooking yourself.  We ended up paying $65 after two dinners, a couple drinks and a 23% gratuity.  The place has casual and open atmosphere.  It would be great to meet up with friends to have a great social time.  Glad we came across this place.  (Try the baby octopus.  Maybe ask for just 1, since 3 come to an order)",

The other night we had a party of 5 did our first order which was 3 orders of beef tongue, 2 orders of roast beef, spicy chicken and 2 orders of shrimp. 3 glasses of chardinay (spelt wrong) and 1 mango cocktail. The wine took 30 minutes to receive mango drink never came. First order came within 10 minutes.  Did a second order and it never showed up. Asked about 3 time they said next on line. After 35 minutes decided we were leaving. I would of been happy just paying for the 3 drinks and 1 all you can eat cause that amount of food would fill 1 person up. Nope charged for 4 all you can eats and the drinks were taken off.. Very unprofessional and sad. Seems with all the new servers they have gone down hill..",

They play pretty good music while your dining. Establishment is really clean although the restroom could use a little cleaning . Service is a hit or miss depending on the time you go I guess . Been here 2x in a matter of 2 weeks .1st time I went with my brother and my oldest daughter ,  service was very slow and they kept forgetting  items we ordered and we had to keep asking . Food was good though.  2nd time I took my husband and brother . It was my husbands first time every eating at an AYCE KOrean BBQ and he enjoyed it. This time around the service was excellent and fast . They had us seated immediately and our orders were out within 2-4 min. Our server was pretty nice and kept checking on us.  Honestly can't go wrong with this place . I've heard there are better places in Las Vegas but this location is down the street from my moms and it's connected to the Galleria Mall (after stuffing your face , you can walk around the mall)   I would come here again, I would consider this my go to AYCE korean place when I'm in Henderson .   My review of 4 stars is based on my 2nd visit and not my first because had it been then I could only give them a 2.5 for the food due to the service .   Give it a try , can't disappoint . (food wise for the price )",

He did a good job letting us know that it was broken and that they were in the process of fixing it the past few days, but buy some fans! A/C aside, the food was fine, but not worth $16 per person in flavor. Plus, with it being 100 degrees in the restaurant, it was nauseating eating in the heat! We ordered a little bit of everything, but most of it was just okay. Our actual waiter was fine, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad. He walked by us a few times to help other tables without checking in on us, but I didn't feel forgotten about. Overall, it was a very meh food and customer service experience, but for the price and the heat it was totally not worth $40+ with tip for two lunches.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.   Its already hot outside. I expect atleast to be able to eat comfortably not swimming in sweat! My son has asthma and could barely breathe! Its a shame me and my family are regulars and love the food here. My sons favorite dish is the kfc. We have been out all day and didn't eat to save our appetite for dinner so we decided to stay and still eat because they actually had the chicken today.  Thats one more thing too. You never know when they wonmt have something on the menu. Last week they had none of the fried chickens! ALL OF THE CHICKEN WAS UNAVAILABLE. And this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT?!? And the squid bulgogi is NEVER available. Why don't they just take it off the menu if you don't even serve it anymore??   Now every single time we come, we are either greeted by the hostess or not. You have to really try to figure out what day is a good day when these people aren't in a mood. Almost every single time we come, they are never smiling. And talk to you as if its such a bother to them to have to take you to a table and explain the rules. Its as if they really hate their jobs and take it out on us customers. What kind of hostesses are these?!? The lady that had a red shirt took us to our table today. With a very annoyed and condescending tone, asked us if we've been here before we said yes and she continued to tell us the rules with the same tone. Not once did she smile and had the expression on her face as if we had done something horrible. I've worked in the food industry and understand when a customer is being really unreasonable and rude. And since I understand that, me and my family ARE never rude yet we still get treated like this with the VERY FIRST person that is supposed to take care of us. We always just let it go because the service after that is usually okay and the food comes out really quick.   But tonight was the absolute worst! Appetizers were super slow, drinks didn't come until 20 minutes later, not even getting refilled until conpletely gone, grill kept turning off and our server did the best he could to fix it but was still cooking very slowly, we were getting meats that we didn't even order and find out the server made a mistake and it was for the other table, and most especially it was HOT. I suggest no one comes here during the summer since their ac is broken!",

Waited another 10mins while I see people that checked in after me got seated. Ok what's wrong with this picture? I went up again to ask the hostess if our table and she said yeah your table is being cleaned. I looked around and saw no one cleaning a table besides the fact that I saw at least 2-3 tables opened and already cleaned. Again I told the girl well u said that 10mins ago that it'll be a min till we get seated. after I said that THEN that's when all of a sudden our table was ready. Weird.  2- they discontinued the fried squid legs and agedashi tofu. Those were my favorite appetizers (well me and the rest of my party)!Minus a star for that as well. Why did they delete those two items? Please bring them back otherwise they'll for sure lose a loyal customer. Now that only brings 4things for their appetizer and their \"seasonal\" ones that they never seem to have because I've been coming here at least once a month and they never seem to always have them.   Other than that shoutout to JAENICA for the awesome service. She was killing it last night in her section. Always checking up on her table and refilling drinks promptly. She is definitely an asset to Gen with her Great service.",

I'd say the service exceeded our expectations, but after the 9th time of different servers always checking up on us & asking if everything's ok gets kinda annoying especially when your trying to enjoy your food. The only thing I had a problem with was the way their checkout system works, they do it on a tablet which relies on wifi signal for credit/debit card transactions. So if your card doesn't go through once they'll do it again. My card was charged twice, but hopefully that'll clear up. Overall good place & atmosphere, being that they're relatively new in town they can make some tweaks.",

We gave her our order and she repeated it back to us and yet she forgot our rice and getting a fork. She wasn't very tentative to our table when we wanted to order more food or even the people sitting around us.   The bartender is the only person who serves drinks, including sodas. Our server had asked the people sitting next to us if they wanted a refill of their Sprite. She had dropped of the cups at the bar and somehow there was some miscommunication and he thought they were dirty dishes. Luna was preoccupied with her other tables that 15 minutes had gone by until she finally noticed they didn't have drinks. She was apologetic every time she stopped at the table.   Even though this is a new restaurant, their servers definitely need a bit more training. I'm a frequent LA KBBQ eater so I know how the all you can eat thing works. The only credit I will give to this restaurant are the bussers. I didn't catch his name, but one of the busboys was frequently coming to collect our plates and ask for a grill change. You go busboy, holding down the fort!",

Seasoned just right and they have more than just meat options also included seafoods. Most disappointed thing was the house steak. No flavor at all. Make sure to always get the bulgogi options! Service was decent! I was absolutely happy when I got seated right away, only upset thing is that it's so hard to get the servers attention & they barely come to check on you. Out of the 60 mins I spent there, our server came check on me \"once\" I get it ur busy but it's a little unacceptable if you got more than over 20 servers the whole store.  The seating arrangements are weird. We were set to sit next 2 another couple that has already been there. And it' were so uncomfortable bc we absolutely could hear everything the other couple said to eachother. Other than that, weren't all that bad! Will come back!",

My bf has never had Korean BBQ so I figured this place would be great. We had dinner fri night and waited about 45 mins to an hour. This place was busy! They had a mall event going on so there was a line inside for small samples for those people participating. We ordered 2 orders of beef bulgogi, brisket, garlic squid, Cajun shrimp, popcorn shrimp, kimchi, spicy cucumbers, seaweed salad, veggies, fried squid and of course a Chardonnay. Warning! Orders of meat are decent sized orders. We ate almost everything because my bf took it upon himself to clean every plate. Bulgogi was my favorite, if you don't cook the brisket right it loses flavor.. There's a grill on the table and YOU cook your food.. So bring your cooking skills. I love this about Korean BBQ, the whole concept and experience... And the food is fresh and hot. Btw all you can eat dinner is $20... I was full and satisfied and well worth it. Only downfall newer businesses tend to be very busy and this place has a great ambiance but because of the busy madness we were unable to enjoy everything it has to offer. Round 2 soon for another try..",

We hope another REAL Korean BBQ opens around this area, like SURA buffet on Spring Mountain Rd, where customers are welcome to select and choose quantities of what they want instead of getting what PONY TAIL dumps on you. Also, HOT beverages should be offered, especially when serving excessively greasy food. Sorry to say this unhealthy fatty and unfriendly place is definitely NOT recommended.",

Unfortunately on this particular day we tried the KFC chicken and it was RAW, we notified the hostess and she was immediately concerned and notified the manager. Our server Julian was also notified and was too concerned. I want to say thank you to them because they really took initiative and just made sure we were ok hence why we enjoy coming back to GEN due to their great customer service. I gave them 3 stars because though Julian and the hostess were caring and made sure we were ok, their manager (an Asian man with glasses) clearly didn't. He came to us and told us he was sorry but our meals were only 50% off and that's all he could do. HELLO, we just ate RAW chicken at YOUR restaurant that could possibly contain Salmonella. Fortunately Julian and our hostess (people who care for their customers) told him we ate raw chicken and we should be compensated for the entire meal. So to the manager or who ever you are at GEN, you should be demoted or learn from your hostess and servers, they're the real MVP.",

This place is very LA, a little too much to be in a town like Henderson. Service was adequate, unlike most Korean places where there are rarely table touches and refills. That's a plus!   Now on to second, third and fourth visits; I feel service (food wise) has gone a little down hill, I've noticed now that this place is poppin, their meat portions they bring out are smaller. With it being busier, our parties are going through the smaller portions faster than they could replenish.  The sides are also smaller, oh on top of that, I'm really sick of them constantly being out of certain items. Some of these items are not seasonal.  When has there ever been a shortage of potatoes? I also remember the fried squid coming out with this awesome crack sauce, that no longer happens now.   The staff are genuinely nice and are always accommodating. I won't take from that.",

I came into this restaurant to join my party and because I was 20-30 min late joining my party they told me that I could not join my party based on their policy. I asked for a supervisor and when he came out and told me that was their policy I responded with \"what kind of policy is that?\" He replied I'm sorry ma'am that's just our policy & I continued to join party. Unfortunately, because of that so called policy we immediately asked for the check and left.",

They seated us promptly but then our order was forgotten about TWICE. Not 1, but 2 times \"the kitchen was overwhelmed and lost the ticket.\" The server was anything but attentive. He never refilled, never checked in. We had to ask another server where our food was and he came to let us know the kitchen had lost our ticket. I had to ask for manager, he did seem to attempt to fix the issue. My recommendation is the one in Glendale, CA - much better atmosphere and staff.",

We told our server, Tao, that we've never been here before and he didn't really explain the process of service, the food or anything. We've been sitting at the table for a LONG time and this server just ignores us. We've asked for items that he simply forgets. He shows up at our table again without any of the items we asked for. The food is really good but if you're waiting 15-20 minutes between each dish being served it kills the entire experience. We regret coming here and will never return.",

I went to sit down in a booth, the entire floor under our table was completely covered in grease/oil! My feet were sliding around when I was trying to scoot in to the booth. We asked the waiter kindly if we could move. He sent someone over to clean under the table. Which I understood that I guess because they were busy peak hour. The man brings a mop!! To clean grease...which did not help at all. I knew...it wasn't gonna be good. We should have left right there. But my kids really wanted to try it out. I had to put paper napkins on the floor to stop our feet from slipping. My shoes were covered in grease when we left, they whole time, something was dripping onto my shoe. Leather Vans RUINED. My sons water had a some kind of plastic string in it. We asked for new glasses of water. They brought an empty glass. Our food was coming out all messed up. I was so disappointed. It felt like they new we were having a bad experience and they clearly did not care, just pay us and get out. We felt robbed. $140.00 Dinner...$60.00 ruined Vans. Looks like I DID get robbed of $200.00.",

They have a really good Gen signature steak, Garlic Chicken, and my favorite was the beef Bulgogi. If you're feeling the appetizers, the fried squid legs & Special Korean Fried Chicken was amazing! The Gyoza was just okay. They change out your grills when it gets too charred so that's really nice.   We've been here twice now. We recently came right after Valentine's Day after they opened & they were pretty steady. Our waitress Alodia had a full section but she was very personable & friendly! They were out of rice for 45 min which I could see a lot of tables getting frustrated (we didn't really mind) but she made sure to keep on top of everything to try & compensate for the kitchen/management's lack of preparedness opening up that day. She compensated for it very well & made the experience great despite the little hiccup of no rice for awhile.   After a decent first experience & wonderful second one, we def will be returning!   Ps: payment at the end is really convenient as well.",

Yes, that Gen had some issues that bothered me, but the food was still really good.  As far as this place, the food was still very good.  But they had issues of their own.   Reasons for only 3 stars.  - ordered food but never got it all - I ordered beer and water, and I had to remind the server 3 times to get my beer and water - they didn't have all beer that was on the menu in stock - had several things on the menu that we couldn't order  because they were out.  - took so long to get our check after asking for it.   I still gave this place 3 stars because of the food quality.  The seafood, beef, pork, and chicken were all of really good quality.  And tasted great.   If they fixed the issues that I had during my visit, I would recommend this place to everyone.",

However nowadays, the staff isn't as friendly or attentive; but the food has remained consistent. Prices are fair but other KBBQ restaurants in the area have better food choices, particularly seafood.   I also bought a gift card here, and when my friend attempted to use it, the staff stated that the balance was $0. This was due to an incompetent staff member who incorrectly rang up the gift card. Good thing I had given my friend the gift receipt because that's the only thing that showed the amount payed. It took them awhile to correct the issue. Thankfully the issue was corrected but it was incredibly inconvenient.",

Howard made sure to check on us often and check with the kitchen to see what was up with the wait for the food. I asked to talk to the manager and scared him a bit. I told the manager about the experience, our great server,and the rude.bartender who had False advertised price for a sake bottle. He hooked it up with a free karaft for the table with sake believe soju,was delicious! I am from California and my Rancho Cucamonga location is the best but for the first location to be out of California its good but needs some turn up music and a stronger team. I'm routing for you!(:",

My favorite meat for this place is the beef tongue. (The way it crunches is so good) On top of that in the beef department, the premium steak, the brisket and the flat iron steak (thin cut but taste better than the brisket actually) are the top red meat cuts. I also consistently order the spicy octopus. For the appetizers I like the japchae, KFC, spicy tofu soup and gyoza. Overall, the environment is pretty cool. There's a bar area and it gives an LA feel (kinda like a club with a bar but clean and hip). The music is like 2000s r and b which I'm ok with. Most of the time there is a wait so I go to the mall next door until my table is ready. The only reason why it's 4 stars is because I feel like the service has gotten sloppier and meat wasn't as cut delicately before but I would come back.",

Okay, the breakdown is going to be feeling, service, and food. Should be simple... I hope   Feel of the place:  I love coming into this place. The color scheme is lovely and the set up is nice. The place gives you a comfy feeling but at the same time, it still feels trendy. It's pretty nice.   Service: Now usually I would give this place 5 stars no problem but the service this time made me knock it down. Now I understand that my family and I came in right as you opened. I fully understand that it was still a bit early in the day but don't blame us that you didn't get enough sleep. Our waitress was very moody with us. It was unappreciated, unwarranted, and very off-putting. Sadly, I can't remember the name of our waitress but I implore you to put a smile on if you're dealing with customers first hand.   Food:  I never have a bad thing to say about the food here. Sad to say that they ran out of things fairly fast. My server said that the kitchen had run out of fish cakes and pork belly. Maybe they hadn't gotten their shipment of supplies in but I hope it doesn't happen next time.",

    "text": "Not the best experience on Korean Bbq! We usually love this place! Our server kept checking on us and we keep telling him the grill is not working properly. Shrimp should not take 25 minutes and thin slices of brisket 15 Minutes. Our Pork belly took just under 40 minutes. We are usually in and out belly full and happy in an hour and 10 minutes. They finally changed our grill plate and we still had to wait for it to warm up and still was not working! He finally told the manager she came by and we showed her how close our hands were over the grill. Literally 1/2 to 3/4 inch over the grill. She checks it and noticed that the grill plate that covers the flame and distributes it was missing! She then cuts up our chicken and of course it's going to cook a little faster! However, it also made it really dry! We lost our appetite. Server asks if we're wanting to order anything else even tho we have the now cooked shrimp and extra dry pieces of shrimp sitting on our plate that we don't want already cause we waited so long for it to cook and they are dry now! Ughhh, and I was so looking forward to a great meal there! He brings the check, and the manager comes to check on us and asks how is it working now! It working a lot better but we lost our appetite because we waited too long for our food to cook! She takes our check and when she comes back, WOW a huge 15% off of our meal price. Not off the whole check. Saved us a whopping $6.60. They could've kept that damn $6.60!!! I would've been happier with the gesture of a comped desert rather than a measly $6.60 even tho the dessert was probably cheaper! Left there unsatisfied and still hungry! Just not for that food anymore! Had to go to Dairy Queen to fill us up with dessert so I can feel like I had a full belly!",

Justin, Natasha & the whole staff were fantastic.  Justin was very personable & helpful.  Love the modern decor, blue ambience lighting, cute red bar, also w/ the grill, a large projector screen, not traditional looking, but food-wise it was great!  Lunch is $15.99 AYCE, 33 items to choose from.  We ordered the Gyoza, Rice Cakes, Bulgogi, Cajun Chicken, Mushrooms & Veggies.  Next time, I would try the shrimp & the KFC, but I was so full!  Also I would order the rice cakes w/ the meat cause after eating rice too... it gets even more filling!  Also, the spicy chili sauce would've went great w/ the chicken.    Quick service, food was great, excellent location, friendly employees, $45 for two w/ wine, totally worth it so come w/ an appetite.",

They're so busy that the waits are almost an hour to an hour and a half with a full house. Mind you that the locations out there are 5x bigger than the one out here in LV. I appreciate good service more than I do good food. Here are our go to's:   Premium steak. I always cut the fat off. But that's just me   The flat iron steak. Similar to brisket, but juicier.   Beef brisket & beef belly.   Bulgogi if I'm feeling a little frisky.   Gyoza, extra kim chi & a side of rice.   I dont doubt that the quality has their days. But if you're not satisfied with the quality, just ask for another set. They're not gonna deny you food... you're at an all you can eat place!

The service is friendly but they always seem to be just slightly short staffed, or staffed with brand new servers. There's always a wait, so we try to come on weekdays for lunch. But needless to say, we love it! We come a few times a month. My fave: short plate (beef belly) My hubby's fave: pork bulgogi  My mom's fave: wine marinated pork belly My kids' fave: macaron ice cream I much prefer the thinly sliced meats with good marbling that are not marinated. Make sure to use the green tea salt...it's amazing!",

    "text": "Swanky Korean AYCE BBQ, what else do I need to say?! My friends who live in Vegas decided to take a few of us visiting from Oahu to this awesome restaurant. I saw one will be opening at Ala Moana Shopping Center within the next few months & I wanted to see what the hype was about.  Luckily for the 5 of us we only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night. For $20.99 you can choose from an abundant amount of meats, sides & seafood to fill you up. Each party is allowed 2 hours to chow down & drink up. The food came out really quickly so we didn't feel like we were wasting our 2 hours waiting for our food. Everything we ordered was delicious & I don't remember exactly what we ordered because I was just so hungry. Your set up comes with 4 sides to share (potato salad, kim chee, picked daikon & cucumber kim chee), salad, 2 sauces & rice.   The staff were very attentive. They always checked on us if we wanted to order more food, have our waters filled or just see how we were enjoying everything. I liked how they asked us if we wanted to change our grill often because it kept everything neat & not burnt.   The 5 of us got a pitcher of strawberry yogurt soju which was delicious. I think happy hour starts at 9 with a ton of drink specials.   If you love to eat, socialize & drink this place is the place to be when in Vegas. Now I have high expectations for the Honolulu location!",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars. The food quality is a decent 4, but the service was a crappy 2-3 star. I decided to give it a 4 due to the cleanliness of the place and neat use of iPads for ordering/paying. This restaurant caught me by surprise as they had some technological equipment.  I went during dinner and for the price of $19.99, you can't really complain too much. This is dirt cheap (well, not as cheap as SoCal) and will definitely be a great place after a workout or if you're just feeling super hungry/hungover. For a party of two, we waited about 40 minutes. Instead of waiting at the restaurant, the hostess took our number information down and said we'd get a text message when our table was ready. Loved this concept. I forgot which platform they used, but great job!   The quality of meat was fairly decent for all the beef dishes. I hated cooking the shrimp, but that was me. There was a mix-up in the beginning and they delivered plates that weren't ours.  No worries.  Appetizers (included in the price): I tried their popcorn shrimp and it tasted kinda stale. The fried squid legs were OK. I was not a fan of the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) as it tasted like Panda Express's orange chicken that was left outside for hours. The edamame wasn't that great either (seriously, how can you mess that up?!)  Service was really slow and our waiter looked consistently overwhelmed. It was clear he couldn't manage the number of tables. Once a server comes to your table, they enter your orders into an iPad Mini and the order gets sent straight to the kitchen. Servers would then bring you your orders within minutes, which was awesome. It seemed super efficient at first, but that's only if you got your waiter's attention.  Pro-Tip: Order all your dishes in advance because the turnaround time for ordering dishes is unpredictable. They also replace your grills too periodically, which was good. I was slightly confused why they didn't pre-grease their grills as our meats got constantly stuck on there.   Overall, this place was a solid 4-star restaurant that I wouldn't mind going again.",

I was solo and opted to sit at the bar which was completely empty since it was an early evening.  The entire staff here was really friendly and several of the employees transferred from So. Ca. to train new hires since they've only been open less then a month.  For those of you who aren't familiar with Gen they are a AYCE KBBQ.  Weekday lunch is $14.99 weekdays and evenings  and weekends are $19.99  The price includes salad and limited banchan but they offer additional appetizers for an extra cost each.  I ordered the signiture steak, baby octopus, cajun shrimp, marinated beef, beef tongue, beef brisket and miso soup. Being solo, the portions were large and filling to the point that I was plenty  full although I wanted to check out the dessert menu. Unfortunately  they didn't offer desserts yet - because they're so new.  After speaking  to the friendly manager from so Cal - he advised me there's several more Gen Bbq's coming to the Las Vegas area which will be convenient.",

This place is not as good as their CA locations, but is much better and WAY cleaner than any other AYCE kbbq in Vegas.   The biggest problem is the service. The wait staff seems to be all over the place. Nobody seems to have tables - every person services every table - which means nobody takes responsibility for each table. Asking about missing orders is futile.  Karage is hit and miss. It's been raw, rock hard and good - very inconsistent. In general, the portions are small, which is good, so that you can try lots of items without having leftovers.  This location has the potential to be great because the food is good. They just have to give their staff some serious direction.",

Anyone who's looking for a Kbbq experience this is the place to go even though it's on the other side of the town but it's worth it!  First of all hands down for our our waitress! She was amazing and very attentive! Unfortunately I forgot her name but I have never had that much attentive server experience at a kbbq restaurant. Not just our assigned waitress but also the other waitress and servers as well. For AYCE lunch is 15.99$ and Dinner is 20.00$ Which is way cheaper than the Kbbq establishments in Spring Mountain.   We waited couple of minutes to be seated because the restaurant was packed that night but we never had to wait that long for our food. Our waitress and our hostess told us we have two hours for AYCE to finish and cannot leave extra meat un eaten and we will be charged (just like all other AYCE places) We ordered AYCE of everything beef. Although it was on the menu, they did not have beef belly servings that night. We also ordered yogurt soju and man it was so yummy and sweet just like we wanted it! Unfortunately we were so full we did not prefer any desert.",

We've been to a ton of places, and I love the food, cleanliness, service, atmosphere, UNLIMITNESS and affordability of Gen!   Food: You can choose from tons of different proteins and veggies including spicy baby octopus, kalbi beef, chicken, and shrimp. There are appetizers such as gyoza and the freshest salad. There are relishes like kim chi, sweet potato mash, and bean sprouts on your table as well as spices and dipping sauces to make your food your own. For around $22+ a person, the possibilities are endless!   Service: We always have the nicest servers at Gen. We've been for birthdays and on other evenings and never have to wait long for food or drinks. They even change out the grills per your request if you want to avoid mixing seafood and chicken and beef etc.   The smartest thing to do, especially on busy weekends or evenings, is to get there early enough to put in your name (all of your party must be there to be seated) and you can even walk around the mall while you wait if needed.  Just writing this makes me want to go back ASAP!",

Lol  Our favorite is the japjae and the red wine pork belly, but everything on the menu is absolutely delicious!   The atmosphere at Gen is also very nice, it's  probably the nicest Korean BBQ spot in the valley.   We love it and recommend it to all our friends.

Korean condiments lined up on one side of the table. The steak was served marinated but lack flavor. You can order beef,  chicken, shrimp, squid, etc. Remember it's AYCE! The appetizers were good. Love the slightly sweetened noodles and crispy pot stickers. That was the highlight for me.   Service was fast and efficient.   Overall:  lots of meat! Incredible price/person, ambiance, modern interior and spacious. I'm definitely  going back. Con: need some kind of assorted Asian sauces on the side to give the raw meats some flavor when grilled.

The staff isn't the friendliest, probably because it is busy and they are rushed. Sat down and the menu is pretty comprehensive. Tried to order some beers for the table but the waiter was too young and had to get someone else to order. Got our food and about halfway done, no one came to check on us and we still couldn't place our beer order. Only when we were almost done did someone show up to let us order beer.   Food is alright, but can't expect much for an all you can eat place. Prices are kinda pricey as well but that's to be expected in a mall and in Henderson. I prefer eating KBBQ at some of the places on Spring Mountain as they are better quality and better service.",

    "text": "5 star review for our dinner at Gen. We went around 8:30 pm on a Thursday and there was no wait. We were seated promptly at a booth, which was very spacious given the extra ledge on the top. I think Korean BBQ places are always lacking table space since there's so many plates.  Our server, Ozzy, totally made our experience at Gen memorable.  He was very attentive and always came by right when we needed him to order more dishes. He had great recommendations and everything was delicious.  Coming from LA, I was so happy to see that Gen had made its way to us from Henderson. We had the dinner menu, and we got to have all you can eat appetizers in addition to the meat. The only downside is that they ran out of the seaweed salad, but there was plenty of other food to make up for it.  Must get: galbi, bulgogi beef, signature pork steak, bulgogi chicken, japchae  Good: chadol (brisket), bulgogi pork, garlic chicken with cheese fondue (interesting), fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, grilled veggies  Probably not again: fried squid legs, Cajun shrimp (too much work to peel)  As with any AYCE Korean BBQ, there are plenty of side dishes, rice paper, salad, rice, etc to accompany your meat. The staff was very attentive our your needs and changed our grill pretty frequently. The thing I love about Gen is the small portion size.  We were able to try so many things with just the four of us.  We also enjoyed reverse happy hour towards the end of our meal. We could mix two flavors of soju, our favorite was the Peach/Yogurt recommended to us by Ozzy. We also tried strawberry/mango and pina colada/yogurt which were good too. All of them are pretty sweet as soju drinks usually are. Overall, we'd definitely visit again!",

An hour on the weekend and 25-30 minutes during the week. The ambiance is laid back, clean decor, and very spacious, and for you single guys, the waitresses are easy on the eyes.   Food is spectacular. The spicy pork bulgogi, premium galbi, brisquit, and beef tongue are superbly marinated and great cuts of meat. Paired with the house salad and radish paper, you won't find a healthier, more fulfilling meal.   Our server was Alodia- very nice, prompt, attentive, and recommended all the right items to complete our meal.   We will come here every time we are in Vegas.",

However, I have to leave a two star because of the heat and humidity inside the restaurant. AYCE Korean BBQ is not cheap, I get it, but if I'm paying $160 for my wife and a few friends I expect it to be nice and cool inside.   The server was nice and sorry for the heat. He checked on it three times for us. The reason I go to Gen over the other Korean BBQ places here is because of the pleasantries, but this time I would've rather endure the poor Korean service from Lee's over the sweltering humid heat inside today.",

Alodia was always giving us more suggestions and constantly making sure we were okay. Overall, this place is great and I highly recommend it!

Our Waitress Alodia was very fast and efficient and I didn't have to get her attention to order more. I believe was his name was Greg, he was very good and fast at clearing  our table for more space. Great place! it's a must if you're looking for some quality kbbq!",

When you go there, ask for waitress Michalina, she is sweet, and caters to all your needs. She took very good care of us. And is very attentive. The steak that I ordered is no thin small piece of steak, but is a very thick and generous portion. Also when you do the All You Can Eat, they give you side dishes of Korean veggies as much as you want. Also they have other specialties like Cheese Chicken Katsu, Spicy Rice Cake , Jap Chae, Korean Fried Chicken to name a few that's also part of the All You Can Eat Menu. It's a clean and modern restaurant and you don't smell like BBQ after you leave. Top spot for Korean BBQ.",

I have had GEN BBQ in California, and I have to say that GEN always pleases me. Their menu is extremely extensive, which I love since other Korean BBQ restaurants have a limited menu.   A few advantages that GEN has over other KBBQ restaurants are: An extensive menu, a bar and great service. Can't go wrong with that.   I personally really like the pork belly. Grab a perfectly crisp piece of pork, dab it with some savory sesame oil and salt sauce, put a piece of perfectly grilled kimchi on top and enjoy a mouth watering, sensational explosion of deliciousness in your mouth.",

A nice surprise tucked away in East Henderson.  The menu was interesting.  Different than what you'd find in Chinatown, and the meats looked and tasted fresh!  It wasn't overly garlic-y in taste, which was a huge plus.  Some dishes were on the sweeter side, like the KFC and potato salad.  Not bad, just different.  I would definitely be back here, but make sure you come early, because it does fill up quickly.  Our server was Janicka (?).  Give her 5 stars across the board ;) and some free meals!",

During our wait, we observed multiple tables which sat empty, waiting for their place settings and when they did get their place settings, they sat people down but you could tell there was a disconnect between the clean up and set up crews. The hostess was doing her best to get people seated and the place was packed with people waiting. It felt like they were short staffed overall.  As soon as we sat down, the waiter took our drink order and plugged it onto their pos system. They took our app and meat order as well. Our food showed up first so we started cooking it and the waiter came back to check on us, but we hadn't received our drinks yet. He went back in and apparently our drinks were sitting on a tray waiting for someone to bring them out.  We ordered more food and had someone else's food show up, it was the table next to us. We think the rest of our food showed up, but by then we were decently full. Then our waiter just disappeared. It looked like they took people from the front of the house and pulled them into the back of the house to clean up. Another waitress refilled our drinks and she brought us our checks.  Usually the place is on par from our previous visits, but tonight was really quirky. Not sure if we'll be back until things get smoothed out again.",

I let the hostess know beforehand that I wasn't eating because I literally just ate with them. They wouldn't accomodate us and stated they were still going to charge me for sitting with them. Wtf. I literally have a receipt from an hour ago, and staff even recognized me. Welp guess it's economical to lose a table of 5 than to believe someone is incredibly full but still brought support to their business. On to the next kbbq @Arirang, which they btw accomodated us perfectly fine and have more authentic Korean selections for my guests :) Left two stars simply because Tau was a cool server from earlier, otherwise y'all ain't getting no more than one. Smh @ management.",

Its a great spot for a date! There's a huge TV screen that i hear plays music videos however, when I went there they were playing infomercials!?  I couldn't quite wrap my head around that.  Anyhow, i got the all you can eat menu!  Me and my brother ordered meat after meat!  My favorites for sure would be the beef cal bee and spicy pork!  Both were full of flavor.  I also tried the deep fried shrip, and octopus which were great as well.  The agedashi tofu was also delish.  I liked how they fried the tofu and served it separate from the sauce.  Get a side order of veggies as well to compliment your meat and your all good!  The highlight of my meal was the desert! They have ice cream macaroons here!  I've never had one before but i loved the strawberry one i got!  I'd go back here again just for the macaroons!",

They have it down to a science, everyone from the hostess to the servers works hard to make sure you are attended to. The only read I'm knocking them down to 4 vs. 5 stars is: 1) They hesitate to allow you to order more if you have a few items still to cook... which I understand to an extent but if we have 4 people and only 1 plate left, let me order... we are here bc we are hungry. Lol. Not a huge complaint but frustrating if you are starving. 2) I am a little disappointed that there are not more vegetables options... I love their selection of proteins and satisfied by the starch but I really enjoy veggies with dinner and with this they are lacking a bit. Otherwise, super happy and I will be back.",

I've only been to one other all you can eat Korean bbq spot, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this place definitely set the bar for any future Korean bbq spots I may go to in the future!  First for all, the sides were great. The kimchi, pickled veggies, seaweed salad, and potato salad were on point. Unfortunately, they didn't have all of the sides but I was pleased with what I had.  The JAP CHAE was beyond YUMS! The beef bulgogi was super tasty, too  and I really enjoyed the kalbi (but I think it was other another name) I wasn't too keen on the pork belly or the squid. Spicy chicken was pretty tasty, but I would recommend ordering chicken first since it takes so long to cook.  For all you can eat for $20 bucks (dinner), I'd definitely recommend this place. I have pretty high standards and I definitely feel like I should have tried so much more, but that's just another reason to go back!",

We came in at 10:30 and during the first round of our meal the hostess brought out our check saying \"were closing the register soon so heres your check.\" They close at 12am not 10:45pm. I work in the restaurant industry and can understand wanting to close the restaurant in a timely manner, but an hour and 15 minutes early when the register is most likely closed last is ridiculous.  When we came in, a table next to us left and a huge piece of chicken fell on the floor (see photo). It was left in the walking aisle the entire time we were dining in. I stepped on it once i forgot about it and so did my boyfriend. The server would accidentally kick it, but still not pick it up. It was disgusting.  Also, the appetizers sit out on the tables until someone comes which is gross and not fresh. At least other kbbq places plastic wrap them until someone comes. I took a photo of an empty table with appetizers waiting. No one ever sat at this table and they took the appetizers out probably to reuse them to sit out the next day.  Our water was not refilled once due to everybody being too busy closing. We finally got a water refill after we asked after we paid our bill.  Our server was one of those people that just took orders, but didn't provide any customer service.  2 stars for food. Food was good and quick and came out before our waters hit the table.",

The garlic calamari was also good, however the beef bulgogi was amazing and definitely the star of our meal.  The service was also okay, not great.   The immediate run down of all the rules was a little off putting and didn't really set the tone for a great dinner.   The cleanliness needs some work, the floor was covered in slick grease and sticky spots under the table.  Their wheelchair etiquette was excellent and for that, I would give them a 5 star rating. They found a bench I could transfer too, no one moved my chair away, so I had access to it.",

The manager who came to our table to check us out said as long as it is an original and not a printed copy we were good. They cant accept photo copied versions.

The food was very delicious and I would love to come back if it wasn't for the loud music.",

They do come by and change the grill when it gets dirty and start to burn the residue of the meats and marinade. The waitress comes by frequently to see if we like to order more. You do have to finish what you order, they will charge extra if you don't finish. The price for dinner is reasonable.",

If you are looking for a Korean BBQ joint with an awesome variety of meats and appetizers Gen is the place to go. I personally will choose Gen over an other KBBQ restaurant in LV. You really get what you pay for, so I'd rather spend a little more to eat here than at another stop.  Now for my recommendations, you absolutely need to get their Beef tongue! This is by far my favorite meat dish because of the texture. Also the marinated steak is really good as well. On top of that their potato salad and tofu soup is delicious.   If I were to rate just the food it would be a 5/5, unfortunately when I ate here last night it took our server nearly 20 minutes to bring our drinks to our table because he forgot. We literally got all the meat we ordered and couldn't find him. Once we had someone stop by our table to change our grill, we asked him for our drinks and he said he'd get our server and it took another 10 minutes or so.",

I can say that while the food is decent, it's definitely nowhere as good as their California locations.   On our first visit, service was terrible and it didn't seem like anyone knew what they were doing. Although service improved a lot by our 2nd visit, the food just isn't what I'm expecting from a Gen BBQ because it's straight up mediocre compared to their sister locations in Cali. Their meats don't taste as good and their steak doesn't have a nice fatty rind like I've had in Cali.   One good thing about this location is that they offer to change your grill top fairly often which is nice. It's also a little weird if you want to pay with a credit/debit card because they send a manager to your table with a tablet to run it instead of taking it to the register...just seems a little unnecessary but works I guess   Would I come again? If I was in the area maybe. This place is definitely not worth the drive down here unless you live in Henderson",

It could get pretty crowded during dinner around 7pm and in some instances where I waited an hour. There's a lot to choose from especially for the price and good variety of side dishes available. Right when we were seated, they gave us a plate of salad and japchae with the side dishes already on the table. The order came out fast. Overall the meat was good quality and service was alright.",

The interior of the restaurant is super nice and not comparable to most KBBQ spots, the food is plated/presented in a more upscale fine dining type of way, and I love that they serve a bunch of sides/cooked items, included in the AYCE price. But let me tell you...if you're going to seat seven people with one grill, at least bring enough meat to actually satisfy everyone simultaneously. This place has got tricks up their sleeves with the plating they use for their meats and sides. I mean, one tiny little plate of kimchee for SEVEN people? You got to be kidding me! It was a joke and kind of insulting in my opinion to be served ONE side of kimchee for seven ravenous individuals. We even asked for seconds and still got served the same amount. Gen, your concept of AYCE lacks the whole idea of what All you can eat Korean BBQ is all about! I was just a tad bit baffled. Lol. I don't mean to offend the establishment but try places on spring mountain or elsewhere and see where I'm coming from.   Other than that, the quality of the meats were mediocre. I had better at other KBBQ restaurants that were a lot more tasteful. In all honesty, this place seemed more of an Americanized feel. If that even makes sense. I wish I got pictures but I had such a long day and forgot to charge my phone battery. I wouldn't suggest this place nor will I refuse to come back. You'll probably see me back here if someone else suggests it and it's out of my power to disagree. Still sticking to Doh on Rainbow.",

    "text": "This Las Vegas location is great!  Gen Korean BBQ is basically the same everywhere... from Honolulu to Cerritos, and Rowland Heights... the service is cheerful and helpful!  The menu and rules are similar - two hour time limit; order four meats at a time; and finish the meats or get charged for the leftovers.    The main difference here was the free and plentiful parking at the Galleria Mall in Henderson; there was no wait; and there was no loud music!  My cousins, mom, auntie, sister, and I were able to have great conversation while we cooked our own food!  We had a great time catching up and talking about all of the dishes!    They enjoyed the Marinated Beef (with the slice of pineapple on the top) the best. It was tender, flavorful and quick to cook.  The banchan, rice, and sauces complimented our meats well.  We got refills easily!  The boy cousins got the Spicy Baby octopus and Cajun shrimp - they ate everything!  We got two of the three extra items that are served at dinner only - tongue and the previously named Hawaiian Steak (yangyum galbisal).  Delicious!  Out of seven of us, only two people had been to a Gen before this dinner.  Everyone got their fill at a reasonable price ($20.99 plus tax and tip) and had a wonderful experience!    Mahalo to all of the employees who were so patient with my auntie and mom!  They were happy that they didn't have to cook!",

As soon as we entered the door we we're quickly greeted and seated. Awesome!   Greg and Natasha did a great job of catering to our every need, and trust me.. my family can order haha   This is actually our first time at this location since we normally go to Sahara's location - but, it's equally perfect. Fast customer service, friendly employees (who I honestly give so much credit too because I couldn't do what they do), the place is clean, and I do appreciate the option of either lunch or dinner ($21.99/person {36 items}).   BTW, I normally order beef tongue &' it's usually all that makes me happy &' content, along w|rice. But, when I got the first order - I wasn't pleased at all. It was really skinny &' because of that, it kept sticking to the grill.   Thank goodness for my other half asking (which I should've.. but, didn't. Sorry!) Anyways, he asked if they could make it thicker - &' they definitely did!   Let's just say - I'm happy, content, &' satisfiedddd!   #kanakattack (Hawaiian Approved) haha",

    "text": "5 stars for Terry. Her was the best server we have had anywhere in the Vegas valley. I may have to update this review tomorrow if I get food poisoning. We ordered the last three pork bellies that we had not tried yet and one looked different than the other two. Took a bite and it ended up being spicy chicken not pork belly so it has to go back in the grill as it was underdone for chicken.  The beef tongue was deliciously seasoned and the definite winner for me. The Hawaiian pork belly stole the silver. The brisket was the runner up, followed closely by the beef belly and the short rib.  The Cajun pork belly was second best on the pork belly list.  The jowel was kind of inedible, so tough and chewy.  Didn't try the intestine, we were warned that it was a lot of work.  Didn't care for the octopus heads and the calamari, but we probably cooked wrong.  Shrimp were fun and messy.  For some reason they put the fully cooked stuff in the midst of the menu, 24-30 I believe, they belong on their own at the end.  Had the gyoza, which were okay. The pork cutlet, I didn't try. The volcano chicken, which was not all that hot to me, nowhere near something that needed a warning.  Children wanted an once cream sandwich, which cost just under $4 each.  We had several grill changes since the meat was thin and so would burn quickly if you don't pay attention Except the chicken, which should be thin..... Or not offered as an uncooked option, too much risk there.",

Yes, it was good, but completely average when taking into account other options and the decent food could not overshadow the terrible service. See below.  2. Service = 5 punches to the throat Upon arriving with a party of 4, we were told that there would be an hour-long wait for the underwhelming Korean BBQ experience (see above). Please note that you cannot make reservations here. However, after an hour, as we were slowly rotting away in the shadows, one of us sought an update and was informed that we had to wait yet another hour... and this was all while at least 5 tables around us were completely empty. Apparently, there's a policy that people who had put their names down before us would receive texts that their tables are ready and are given a 15-minute grace period to show up, but this is hardly effective if no one monitors that time limit and keeps open tables empty for 30 - 40 minutes while other parties are available in person to be seated immediately. Ultimately, we ended up waiting around 3 hours to be seated because we kept falling for the incremental increases to our wait and the False understanding that the food would be worth the lost time. I found a list of things that one can do with an extra hour due to daylight savings: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fkevin-daum%2F24-things-you-can-do-with-an-extra-hour.html&s=376aa8a81554088f2a43d1642f202ad2facfca4dfebe1aabc08e83b4676045bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">inc.com/kevin-daum/24-th...</a> -- imagine doing all of those things THREE TIMES.  3. That one guy at the bar = 2 thumbs up I will say, the guy working at the bar during the evening shift was attentive, competent and polite despite our #firstworldproblems.",

Last time we ate there we had a lovely young lady help us. I believe her name is Alodia, she was very helpful when it came to suggesting what to order and also answered every question we had for her. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because there was a little bit of a wait for rice but everything else is great! Definitely recommend this place!",

When you combine that with their good food, which has always been good, you really have a place you want to spend an evening.",

We were charged $10 for my 6 year old brother to eat a bowl of rice. Right off the bat, I got a weird vibe from our server; he seemed kind of annoyed. I ignored it and remained optimistic. Our meats kept coming but the grill wasn't being changed. Our server only came around a couple of times within a 40 minute timeframe and ghosted us. I waited 30 minutes for a drink refill. Also, I was certain that rice came with the meal, but we had to put in an order for it. A different server came around and started tending to us. We eventually asked if she was our new server, which she replied yes and informed us that our original server went home. She found it odd that he didn't bother to let us know that he was leaving. She saw that our grill was completely black and changed it immediately. She was friendly and attentive, which made the experience better. However, I don't think I will return to this location. The experience was just too negative, especially when there are other locations.",

There were about 3 appetizers missing, no ice tea, and they do not carry the famous Hawaiian steak here.  Not a fan of the kimchi, k.f.c, fried pork cutlet, and popcorn shrimp.  That being said we really enjoyed everything else.  The quality and unlimited amount of Korean Bbq was awesome!  Most importantly for $20!  The one thing that I really loved was the pork cheek (#2 hangjungsal) just as good as my favorite restaurants Kyara and Raku.  Service was fantastic also, especially Lisa!",

Cooked them up barely finished one whole piece. The Manager Jessica really lovely woman explained there were different seasonings and sauces we could get that were not served at the start. And we could order half orders. well we know that next time but for future first timers we recommend and also for people who forget. Please revamp the menu telling newbies what comes in a full order and comes in a half order. what other seasonings are there, and what else can there be that is secret menu worthy. We were told you learn these things as you keep coming. But speeking from a customer service rep for 16 years some people just wont come back if they don't like what they had or think its odd or ridiculious. Either way nothing wrong with what we had we will be back again",

On the other, the service was quite rude, and I still don't understand why. My friend and I were dressed appropriately, and we were super nice to everyone who was serving the table. The servers pretty much ignored us, though, and when our waiter deigned to make eye contact with us on his way around the restaurant, he always seemed to be annoyed that we were bothering him asking for a refill and was bristling with impatience when we asked for more meat. He was overly polite to the couple next to us, though, even though they were quite demanding; maybe it was because we were an ethnic minority that night?   Food and drinks took forever to get to us, and the portion sizes weren't consistent. We got a tiny little portion of beef bulgogi, so we asked for more, and the next time the portion was 3 times the size. It made it hard for us to judge how much to order, especially when you're charged extra for leftovers. The food tasted good, but I don't know if it's worth it when there are other Korean BBQ restaurants in the city with staff that don't make you feel like a leper.",

    "text": "This is my favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place! Even if it's a 27 minute drive from where I live, I wouldn't mind coming here on a weekly basis! I love this place mostly because of their friendly staff and their FOOD, duh! The interior design is a bonus.  I really don't know where to begin with this place. But let's start with location. It's right next door (literally, a 1 minute walking distance) to the Galleria Mall. They are usually packed on weekends and during the night time. So whenever I have to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, my party and I would look around the Galleria Mall to pass time. Along with the ease of reserving a table, they have an app you download that would notify you how many people are in front of you on the list, and tell you when your table is ready. Keep in mind that you can't reserve ahead of time via phone call, you can only reserve at the front check-in desk to have them write your name on the list.  Now back to getting seated. There are booths and high tables to sit at. The booths and tables are good for parties of 4-6? However, each both has only one grill, whereas the high tables have 2 grills for every 8 seats. The restaurant is still fairly new so of course everything is spankin' clean!   I usually come here with parties of 4-8 so we order by the BULK, literally. Our favorite appetizers are the:  1. Fried Squid Legs 2. Japchae! 3. Sesame Chicken 4. Korean Fried Chicken 5. Seaweed Salad 6. Salad 7. Rice (a must lol)  and for meats we love getting: 1. Marinated Prime Rib (#10) 2. Brisket 3. Pork Belly 4. Bulgogi 5. Spicy Chicken  The quality of the food tastes better/fresher than other AYCE KBBQ places I've been to in Vegas. They have a large variety of food as well, making the price of lunch ($14.95) and dinner ($19.95) all the more WORTH IT. And I'm glad I don't leave feeling gross and smelly like how I do at Tofu Hut or Haro. They have a bar and happy hour as well, but unfortunately I have yet to partake in that experience ): The ambience is trendy and classy since the lighting is dimmed. Don't worry you can still see your food and company still!  The customer service is great overtime I come here. No matter how busy or understaffed they seem, it is always quick and personable. We get our grill changed accordingly and have no problems with the workers.  I truly recommend this place if you're looking for an AYCE KBBQ place. The distance might be a deal breaker but it's no problem for me. Thank you for opening in Nevada Gen KBBQ!",

Even though there were lots of AYCE policies given at the beginning, I didn't see anyone really check if we follow the policies. That makes me feel really comfortable.",

It is conveniently located adjacent the galleria mall to walk off all the shameless flavor saturated in your gut. The marinated beef is mouthwatering. The chicken however, is a pain in the butt to cook. It takes forever. Besides that, the appetizers or sides that come with the food are deliciously simple, fresh, and crisp. My only complaint is that they don't have rice paper sheets. What does a girl have to make a darn taco?",

Food is the same as all the other Gens but what made this branch special is the service that they gave to me and my family. It was a busy dinner service with wait times of up to an hour but it was definitely worth the wait. This branch needs to thank Jan. Because of her, I can say that this is the best compared to the other branches. Not only was she beautiful but she was also very compassionate with her service. She made sure that we were enjoying our meal and gave us tips to make them even better. She knew the right time to come and check up on us and she was constantly available whenever we needed her. She definitely made my stay in Las Vegas a memorable one. Kudos to Jan!!",

So we decided to try here. Well for starters, when we walked in we were greeted warmly by the beautiful decor and friendly host staff. We were seating in booths that are quite comfortable. Service was amazing, we had the pleasure of having Ozzy who was supper efficient in eveything from water refills to explanation and recommendations to stuff in the menu! They even have appetizers included In the AYCE. Our meats were brought out quickly and they were delish. I will say the lack of bachan (side dishes) were very scarce and in the korean tradition (I'm half korean born and raised in korea) those are important. Non the less the appetizers did a good job in replacement of missing banchan. My son was enjoying his pork cutlet and even had 2 orders! I was too busy enjoying the food I forgot to take more pictures. Overall great environment, cost, taste, food and service! Thank you Ozzy again and know we will be back just for your service!!!!",

This place has been open long enough for these guys to get a good flow of things, but I guess some take longer than others to learn. Why do I have to ask 4 times in a span of 35 minutes for my rice to come out? If there's something going on that's out of your hands, that's totally understandable. But you gotta let me know so I won't keep asking! But every time I come here, it seems they just keep forgetting. Same goes for radish paper and rice paper. It's ridiculous. And it's bad when you notice that your server only has 2 or 3 tables and they're still struggling. I'd love to grab a job here just so I can empathize how hard it is to work here, because they make it look so hard.  I really wanna give this place, at least a 3 but even some of their meat options are going down the drain and it hasn't even been that long! The brisket is always too dry. They're lucky their short plate beef is good, it's the only meat I get here besides the beef tongue. So here's to you, Gen. Two stars. I keep coming here, hoping that it'll get better, but I'd rather go to Tofu Hut.   P.S. Their only good server that I've had was Seung (sp?) If you want the best service here, then ask for him.",

They took our order quickly and brought everything out pretty fast too. The food was good, but not amazing. The fact that it's all you can eat makes it a good reason to come back. My favorite was the boneless galbi. Most of the meats were tender, but they lacked a little flavor...maybe some more seasonings like sesame seed oil and sesame seeds would help and a sweeter more flavorful Korean BBQ sauce. There were several different waiters coming by our table making sure we didn't need anything, but we did have to ask a couple of times for a fork and to get more spicy cucumbers...but that might have been because of the number of people that were tending to us. Our main server, Kevin, was awesome!!! He made suggestions and had pretty good knowledge of everything on the menu. He was super polite and friendly too. If there was something he didn't know, he quickly went and found out.  The atmosphere was good, even though they had people working on the bar and by the door. They had music playing, but not too loud, and when happy hour started, they all cheered and yelled out, \"It's happy hour!!!!\"  All in all, it was a good experience. My friends and I will be coming back.",

I am all about customer service especially when I work in the same field. The ladies at the front was very welcoming to seat us. However our server Julian sucked. He did not look happy at all and it took him awhile to get our order. As soon as he came over, he rushed us to order our food  & seemed annoyed we were still looking st the menu. He forgot to get our drink order first before getting our food order. My boyfriend tried to talk to him but he was quick with getting our order then left. We had to keep asking other servers to get us refills on drinks or sides. He was gone for a long time and finally my boyfriend asked another server if Julian can place another order for us but he said he was on break. (That's unprofessional. a heads up would be nice)The second server I forgot her name (she's Filipino) but she was very sweet & actually made us feel welcomed. She also lost her voice  & said she was getting over being sick, but still had a smile and had great customer service. Finally when we were about to leave and we see our server again Julian and my boyfriend gives him the check, he did not say thank you or anything. As we are heading out the door, he had the nerve to ask us if we would go on yelp and write a great review for him because the person with the most reviews would get a promotion. Sorry not going to happen when you had crappy service & was not engaged at all. The second server I wish I got her name but she was awesome!",

The cashier was very overwhelmed and had to repeat our order 3 times but I didn't really mind considering he's probably had a rough day. However, they don't have any kind of system for distributing the custard, they don't take names or give numbers or anything like that. I didn't even get a recepit so I didn't even know how to ask for my order. Because of this, I watched people who were in line after me get their stuff before me. After 20 minutes of this, I finally said something and they just totally lost my order or I don't know what. Their frozen custard is good but their service on a busy night was greatly disappointing and not to mention it's rather pricy. I probably will still return when it's not so busy but beware when coming in during peak times.",

    "text": "We came in with a party of 13, and got quoted an hour and a half. Ridiculous amount of time, but we were set on Gen BBQ, so we decided to wait. And although it was closer to 2 hours before we were sat, our server Samuel and the delicious food made the wait well worth it. Let's just start off with a big ollll' round of applause to Samuel. We were probably one of the most obnoxious crowd, with hungry and needy people,  but he was able to not only accommodate every single one of our requests, but also had such a good attitude and everyone brought out our food so quick. He even sang happy birthday to my brother with everyone! :) So now the food. Over 30 different, all delicious, selections for only 20 dollars. Whaaaaaat. Our party was put on two tables. Our table had 7 people. We ordered 18 briskets, 2 pork bellies, 11 beef tongues, 8 bulgogis, 2 orders roast beef, 1 calamari, and the list can go on. Every single dish was delicious and you bet we finished all of our orders. The only reason for the 4 stars was because the hostesses quote inaccurate wait times, and a party of 13 can get super impatient, super quick. And also, the tapas were very minimal.. I've never had gen bbq in california, but I've heard everyone rave about it so I didn't really know what to expect. But they are by far the best kbbq in town, even if it is a good 30 minute drive, it is all worth it!! Samuels the best!! :)",

But I decided to give it a 5 start anyway because of their seafood variety, great customer service and fun atmosphere.  My husband had been wanting to go here since I told him that I really enjoyed one of their California location. This place is just too far coming from Summerlin South considering there are a few closer similar joints to us in the China Town area. We used to go to Hwaro despite of their not so good service because it was closer. When our kbbq date was up, I decided to bring my husband here for a change of atmosphere . The menu selection was great. The food was good too. For some reason I still really like their California locations better. Hubby said to give this place a 4 star. Said that he liked the service here better than Hwaro but he thought Hwaro's food tasted better. I'm giving it a 5 start because they offer more seafood option and I only eat seafood. They have shrimp and squid in different styles. Customer service is also great! Ive always believed that a great restaurant staff can play a huge role and help enjoy a good enough tasting meal. Rather than putting up with a crappy staff and could barely enjoy a tasty meal. Actually there is just one guy that irritated us at Hwaro and he's ALWAYS there lol. About 5'5 korean server, attitude.",

We were next door at World of Beers when we decided our group needed some food - we knew that Gen usually has a wait list so me and a friend walked next door to reserve a table. We told Marisol, the hostess at the time, that we had a group of nine. She said the wait would be approximately 45 minutes to an hour - this was fine since we were finishing up at WOB. She asked us whether we would like a high top with two grills, or the tables which came with three grills. We opted for three, set the reservation, and waited for the opening next door. After about 50 minutes, we still didn't get a text with an update on our table so the group just walked over to Gen... apparently there was a 'mistake' and we had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes longer...fine. After the next wait, two of us asked Marisol what the deal was... and apparently now we would be getting a table with only two grills. We told her that we originally asked for the table with three grills - seeing her reaction, she knew that there was an issue.   Marisol walked over to speak to their manager Carlos and told us that if we wanted the 3 grills, we would have to wait another 30-40 minutes because another group was placed in front of us. Absolutely not - we were not waiting anymore.   In the end, our group got split up into two tables with two grills total.  I don't know what the deal was but steer clear of Marisol and Carlos because they definitively don't know what they're doing.",

For appetizers we got the Korean fried chicken and gyoza. I basically ate all the KFC chicken myself, it was so flavorful! The hostess Kris and our server Ozzu also offered some of their recommendations, which was helpful.  I really enjoyed the marinated steak and and the bulgogi (#5). Wasn't too much a fan of the fatty brisket.  Ozzy was very attentive, stopping by our table often to ask if we needed anything more.  You have two hours to eat so take it easy. By the time I left I was stuffed and slept with a happy belly that night.",

At $19.95 for AYCE dinner, and cheaper for kids under 10, it is reasonably priced, and the quality of food is very good. The appetizers are included in the AYCE as well.  The banchan (side dishes) are limited, but tasty. I liked the cucumber and potato salad, but don't like that they put cilantro in the shredded daikon.  The bulgogi chicken and bulgogi beef were good.  They don't freely give sesame oil, so if you're into that just ask and they'll get some for you.  The entrance is out front outside the mall, facing south.  You can check in, and download an app that notifies you when you're getting close so at least you can visit the mall while you wait.  Being it was their second day open, the staff did okay but it'll get better with time.  We are definitely going back.",

However, the last few visits have been noticeably different as far as service, quality of meat, and overall dining experience. We literally have to ask for our waiter/ waitress to return, our empty plates are piled high at the edge of the table and bus boys will walk by without touching them, and items that we order never come out unless we ask for them repeatedly.  As far as the quality of meats go, we always order their #1 and you get a beautiful cut of steak. Lately the steak has been brownish/blue on the edges like it was the cut on clearance at walmart.  I'm not sure wether this decline in quality is due to new management or just random bad days for them, but I do know I'll be finding a new place to try for Korean BBQ.",

Their salad is the only thing that is still amazing, god I love it! We ordered rice and barely got any in the bowl that was served, you would've thought it was half eaten already.

Macaron ice cream sammies at the end are a must!  Service is great with the exception of when our food and orders arrives at our table. Especially during a bigger party. Tonight there were 9 of us because we were celebrating some festivities. We had 3 grills. I was so annoyed when they'd bring our meats, appetizers and even drinks out. They'd just place them anywhere on the table and my family has to figure out amongst ourselves what is what and where/who they belong to.   There's gotta be a better system about who ordered what on the table. Just because I order a cut of meat, doesn't mean I'm going to know that it is what you brought out especially if you just placed it at the other end of the table. Same with our drinks, which should be the easiest thing for them to do.",

    "text": "Gen from outside the entrance looks like a really quiet restaurant. Yet as soon as you emerge through the front doors the fun environment, the colors of the lighting and the beats from the music just fill you up with this awesome vibe that is Gen. The decor of Gen is very modern yet has slight classy aesthetics of the Korean culture sprinkled through the layout. It's actually very eye catching once you come through the entrance. For the style alone I give Gen 5/5 stars.  Let's get down to the main part of the review here. The food, the comfort,  and our help/service.  Gen is all you can eat...and the pricing is actually very reasonable. $20 per person isn't bad at all! Especially if you have 34 choices of meats and items + any of the appetizers + all of the sides. All of that for just for $20! My wife and tried as much as we could. We started with appetizers: gyoza(fried), edamame, japchae, pickled veggies, potato salad, and a salad. -Only gripe was the edamame which was a little over cooked but didn't stop me from enjoying them. Everything else was delicious! Now the main part....MEAT! So many wonderful choices!  We ordered: Beef bugolgi, garlic chicken,garlic calamari,steak strips,pork cutlet,cajun shrimp, roast beef, bugogli chicken, and I know more just can't remember it all. Everything was freaking delicious! The portions were not too much nor too little. The plethora of flavors kept my dance buds dancing all night. Gens good easy get 4/5 stars  All this yummy food was accompanied by the awesome booth seating we asked for. The booth was comfortable, soft and supportive. The tables had a nice feel to them, like a mixture of vinyl and marble. The table was large enough for our multiple plates, our drinks, the sides and our entrees; with plenty of elbow room to spare. Oh and I almost forgot the cooking pan sits dead center of the table! So all in all the comfort level was indeed a 5/5 stars!  Now onto the icing on the cake , the service. Adolina was our main service of help for the night and she was awesome!  Really attentive and friendly. She made recommendations that were awesome! She always had our glasses full and prompt when making sure our cooking pan was replaced immediately when it started to have all the excess burnt food sizzling on it. It's easy to express that Adolina was just pure awesome sauce; friendly, fun, informative, and an all around suburb waitress. We will be back for her service and friendly smile along side the food!  Adolina services alone help give Gen a 5/5 stars.   So to sum it up for you yelp readers, Gen is fun, has great food, energetic atmosphere and has amazing service. Let Gen be your next Kbbq experience!",

Once your seated the server instructs you these is a 2 hr limit and if you don't eat the stuff you ordered they will charge you more. Oh I forgot to mention it's a all you can eat. The menu consists of 36 items with a few of the items is shrimp, beef tongue, sirloin steak, chicken. They bring what you order very quickly. You have a very hot grill in your table to cook all the wonderful meats you choose. They give you 8 sides to  enjoy as well. Kim chee, mashed potatoes with corn , coleslaw,  etc  the other great part is it's only 21$ a person. I highly recommend trying Gen it's located at the galleria",

I blame the side dishes on the table that are always sitting there before anyone is seated. I watched a table from beginning of my meal-end and saw the sides still sitting out. Is that potentially a health violation?!  3. The chairs are falling apart! If you're wearing shorts, as I do in this Vegas heat, forget being comfortable! The seats will scratch your thighs all meal long.  I want Gen to step up their game because they're in a good location with lots of people loving the food and atmosphere. Don't let yourself slip!",

    "text": "The previous reviews of this place had me expecting good food and crappy service. They were spot on! The crap service in my experience came from the hostess stand not so much the server. We walked in at 5:30 and the place was packed. We were told the wait for a table would be 30-35 minutes, whereas the bar would be available in 5-10. We opted for the bar, and the hostess took our name, asked us for ID and said we just had to wait for them to set up the bar seating. We waited about 15 minutes, watching the bar seats get pulled over and the ban chan placed around the burner. Meanwhile a couple walks up and I see them getting carded as well, thinking oh they've chosen to sit at the bar too. I see a short conversation between the hostess that took our name and the one carding the new couple, then she turns around and leads the couple to the seats we had already waited 15 minutes for. I immediately look to the the girl that took our name and she responds \"She didn't know you were waiting, I'm sorry.\" She spoke while rolling her eyes and talking as if she could care less that we were inconvenienced. We then had to wait about 5 more minutes for another place to be set up. I was so mad, by the time we sat down the other couple that bypassed us already had meat cooking on their grill. When we ordered, it literally took 15 minutes for our first plate of meat to come out. The spicy baby octopus was the first to arrive. I do like that the portions are small, so you can try many things without being too stuffed. The pork cheek was too thick and tough, and was void of flavor. The premium steak wasn't ribeye, but was still tasty. The smoked garlic pork belly was salty and smoky deliciousness. The red wine pork belly was good but very sweet. The pork steak and the spicy pork bulgogi might have been my favorites. The garlic calamari was flavorless. They were out of squid. The garlic chicken with nacho cheese was underwhelming. The marinated premium steak was small but tasty with a sweet pineapple ring on top. The beef tongue was a bit bland. I will say that sitting at the bar has its benefits as you're able to ask your server across the bar for drink refills and meat refills. All being said, if you show up when they're not busy, or stand far enough away from the hostess stand to not notice them shuttle in people that came in after you, you might enjoy your experience here. As for me, I'll be trekking back Hwaro to get my fix.",

    "text": "Went here for my brother in law's birthday. First thing, it was a long wait but I kind of expected it as it's close to the holidays. Once we were seated, our party was seated in two different booths so we were separated from each other. Then came the service. It sucked. We asked our waiter for more kimchi and other small things and they never showed up. When we placed our order, half of the items we ordered never showed up. We had to constantly stop him or another server to bring us our orders which still some orders didn't come or it was completely wrong. It was very tiring having to constantly wave down a server for more drinks/refills and to order. We were barely checked up on as the servers were too busy playing around or focusing on another birthday party. The food was ok not the greatest but not the worst either. To add to the disaster already, the server and or cashier lost $100 of our $300 something bill. We waited an extra half hour while they investigated. As the cashier swore up and down that she counted her drawer multiple times. Which I found very odd as when you receive cash, you count it and if it's the wrong, you do not put it in the cash drawer, you keep it out instead of mixing it with the money in the register. The manager finally determined that she had miscounted. If it wasn't for my other brother in law saying that we were embarrassed (which we were and had small children with us and keeping them calm and controlled during this ordeal was hard) and waited half an hour, we probably wouldn't have gotten the free tray of macaroons for their mistake. It was just a disaster coming here. I will probably never return as there are better Korean places in China town and in the neighborhood.",

Now Korean restaurants are few and far between in the valley so I had to rely on yelp reviews to decide where to go. Once we committed to Gen, we got very excited!  Aside from the to-do of the Grand Opening, we enjoyed the wonderful flavors of Korean BBQ! The three of us had the All-You-Can-Eat menu and from the appetizers to meats and seafood we were very impressed with the flavors and quality. The service was also very good! We will definitely be back and will bring others!!!",

He was also present for whenever we wanted to order more and that's amazing because the usual problem here is that servers can disappear forever or forget to bring things you ask for.

We woke up late that day, came here around 2pm for our first meal of the day. A few hours later she was vomiting on and off for the rest of the night.  The only things she had that I did not was the shrimp tempura and an iced green tea. My money being on the shrimp.  Stick to the meat and avoid the seafood as a precaution.",

But the last few times we've gone here, they have told us they \"don't have RICE PAPER today\" and this has been the case for the last 2 visits. It's an off menu item but we absolutely love the rice paper and I'm afraid they no longer serve it. Someone please let me know if anyone's come more reverent and have had it!",

    "text": "First let me say how excited I am that there is Korean BBQ on this side of town. Absolutely pumped. We've been twice already since it opened. The service was really good the first time, and kinda shotty the second time. It was a little slow, but if you order enough each round, you typically have no problem flagging someone down before your food is gone. I also felt like I needed to ask for every little thing (rice, lettuce, sides, etc.) and they were way less busy the second time so I'm not sure what was going on. There are also a ton of options and variety which is great (wish they had 1 or 2 more veggie options). They will gladly let you switch your grill top or you can ask for oil if the grill top starts to make everything taste burnt due to older food sticking on it. Highly recommend this to anyone who lives on this side of town.",

We've been here during some great days and some just sub-par days when it gets too busy. Today my little brother and I came for an early dinner and it was close to amazing!  First off, it wasn't as busy today because we came around 4:45 on a Saturday & stayed for about an hour (beat the rush hour!). The meats came out quickly and with generous cuts, our drinks were refilled in a timely manner, they offered to change the grill twice, and we even ordered 2 green tea macarons for dessert at the end which is an extra charge.  However, the experience was great because we had a GREAT server-Jessica. She was very polite, helpful, checked up on us regularly AND she looks around while she walks to make sure her tables are doing okay. She offered suggestions on menu items like a good server should, but her friendliness and attentiveness were what made her stand out. Like I said, I've come here often, and it's normally a hit or miss, but she went above and beyond. Thank you for the great service!",

I'm from Cali and they have several locations out there and I have to say their Vegas location is just as good if not better cause they have great service here. Every time you come in everyone always greets you and I LOVE how large this restaurant is cause there's hardly ever a wait here. Many of the other Korean bbq blacks I've been to are much smaller and only have like 12-15 tables. This place has like at least 30 tables which helps out a lot. Specially on weekends.   My favorites are the Beef Bulgogi, Hawaiian Steak and the Beef Brisket. I also like getting the gyoza, the pork fried dumpling  things. Very good. Also I love the salads they're very basic but the dressing makes it amazing. I even get a side of the dressing and dip my meat in it. They have a ton of complimentary sides like kimchi, edamame (which you can order a whole side order of) potatoe salad, Cole slaw, tofu, and more. And these are unlimited as well. Some Korean bbq spots charge you extra for these sides. The strawberry lemonade is amazing btw, probably the best I've ever had right next to Lucille's.   This is definitely a great Korean BBQ spot especially if it's your first time, I think you'll have a great experience.",

Only feedback is that we arrived about 9:30pm on a Sunday and were seated at the communal table on the east side of the restaurant. No problem there... However they began to shut down that side about 10:15 while we were still eating an the clank of dishes and smell of cleaning products dampened our dining experience. I wish the hosts had sat us on the main side that wasn't being shut down... Especially knowing we would be there past the other guests.  However Jan ended our evening in a great way with a big smile and invited us back soon as we were leaving. Thank you Jan! Overall great food and service and we will be back!",

    "text": "Considering this place is slightly more Americanized the service was stupid bad! Our server had a section of nine and as much as I wanted to feel sorry for her, all she does is use the iPad and get drinks... so why was she so busy to take MY order?   The place is fully staffed?!   My favorite was when we tried to order seconds and our grill burned for a good 10 minutes, drinks were empty, before she comes over and asks if we're done...?? Not to mention she lets us know after my other half complains that they are out of some of the meats we ordered.  After the next set of food arrives, everything shows up in 2s.... So, I ordered a good 6 dishes and she comes out with 12? I'm sorry but I never said 2 of everything and I certainly cannot eat all of that. Don't understand where her brain was.  Super frustrating to be excited about KBBQ next to my house to only stick to Chinatown with my angry waitresses with broken english who always let me leave with smiles.",

Spicy Baby octopus was yummy which is worth order twice or more. Beef and chicken there were really thick, cut in pieces b4 or while u cooking. The spicy pork is also perfect. Need to change the grill often or if u don't mind. No oil on the grill so it always make meat over cooked.",

The smoked is sucked into the grill area rather than a vent above the table.  The food was good! They ran out of the Kalbi style meat though.  The appetizers were good.  The salad was simple and light.  They don't have much dipping sauces (brisket sauce and sesame oil) was all they had.  But over all good for the price.",

    "text": "If you want some good AYCE Korean BBQ, GEN is the place to come.  I have to say that the wait for place is awesome. They were able to seat 7 of us in 10 - 20 mins @630pm on a Friday night. Pretty impressive.  Their sides, appetizers, and meats are delicious. I'm very pleased with their food and all the different varieties meats they have to offer.  TIP: When ordering especially with a large group order in small increments. We did the mistake of ordering a lot and them bringing everything all at one time. Don't get me wrong. I love fast service but we were literally running out of space on our table. So that was little irritating. But after cooking a few meats as fast as we could we eventually made space.  //GEN has a time limit when dining. 2 hours. To most this is more than enough time to dine. But I find when we dine especially in a large group 2 hours fly by. So when we reached our 2 hour limit they had no problem letting us know. I was a bit upset because we were still ordering. However we were ordering alcohol. We ordered 3 pitchers of Sapporo and 3 bottles of sake and 2 other bottles of beer. So it wasn't like we were just sitting there doing nothing. So we had to rush with our last pitcher.  //One more thing that was a bit bothersome was that we had 3 different servers. Which was fine because it felt like if we asked anyone for anything they would gladly get it. But I just felt like if we were going to be served by someone else other than our server than maybe an introduction was of been nice instead of Eddie saying oh I'm taking over for Kevin now but I'm leaving so I'll come back and introduce your next server ... and he never did.  So the night wasn't perfect but we had a great time and ate great food. Oh! and dont forget Macaron Ice cream sandwiches!!! We'd definitely comeback again.",

Interior: Unlike most KBBQ place which has a pretty casual vibe inside, the inside of this place was so fancy! It was also really cool and not smoky like some kbbq places.  Grill: The ventilation of the grill is great! Usually when I am at kbbq, I have smoke blowing in my face at some point. Not here!  Selection: so many different selections for a great price! I love that they have various type of sea food instead of just one. Most places I have been to, have different menu set with increasing prices so I always feel like I am missing out by going cheap. Or if you go to a cheap kbbq place you get like five selections.  Side Dishes: I usually don't eat these and they didn't have a great selection (some places gives you ten different dishes). I did love the potato salad and the fact that they had pickled radishes. They ran out of rice paper when we went :(  Price: Reasonable lunch and dinner prices. I went for lunch and loved it. I would say lunch price is most worth it for me.   Service: Really nice service! Water refills! They changed out grill so often and was always asking if we need something. Paying was super easy because they brought the electronic payment system over so we can pay. We didn't have to wait for the check or anything.",

    "text": "I heard all the hype with this place from all my Cali friends and was craving kbbq real bad so decided to check this place out! & then also ended up coming back the very next day lol.  It's located outside of Galleria mall by JC Penny. Parking was a lil shit both days but they offer valet. Interior is veryyyy nice. One of the nicest kbbq restaurants I've been to (I haven't been to many). There's even kbbq stoves at the bar, I thought that was pretty freaking neat haha.  My first visit here was with one friend. We walked in and about a handful of workers looked at us then looked at each other like they didn't know what to do before a few of them finally greeted us. We only waited about 5-10 mins to be seated so it was not a bad wait. Our waiter was really nice, she already seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't hesitate to explain it. AYCE Lunch is about $14.99 while Dinner is $19.99, not bad!  Second visit was with a much larger group. Waiters still all over the place but I cut them some slack since they are still pretty brand new. You know, they forget my miso soup spoon, the straws, ask us if we ordered Premium Steak as we are CLEARLY ALL getting out of our chairs to leave lol. It's all good though, I'm still coming back!!  Anyways I wanted to get this salad issue  off my chest cuz I thought it was kind of funny. During my first visit, after we had placed our order, my friend and I noticed that the couple next to us, who was seated AFTER us, received their salad before us. Or at least we though it was their salad because the way it was placed closer to their invisible dividing line so we asked for our own. Even the couple wasn't sure if it was theirs or ours so no one ended up touching it. We end up getting our own, then like 30 mins into the waiter brings out a 3rd salad all confused but just sets it by them anyway. AND THEN when we were almost finished with the meal, a different waiter finally tells us \"oh that's your guys salad btw\" I was like -___- why would you put it on that couple's invisible dividing line then!?!? Gaaah man get your salad shit together lol. Anyways, the food!!  Favorites: The brisket, spicy pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, cajun shrimp, sesame chicken appetizer  Least Favorites/or just straight up hated: Red Wine Pork Belly (hated), Miso Pork Belly, Regular Pork Chop or Pork belly (I think).   The red wine pork belly literally just tasted like wine. I felt bad because I didn't care for it at all and neither did my friend who originally wanted it. The miso pork belly was slightly better. It didn't taste like miso at all and didn't have too much flavor. Now I THINK this was the pork chop, if that was even on the menu but all I know is that I didn't like it at all. It was probably the way we cooked it though but still, I just didn't really enjoy it.  The spicy pork bulgogi is a MUST. It was my most favorite out of everything. & brisket, well, I just love any brisket. It tasted like every other brisket. Nothing special but I really enjoyed it.   Overall, the service could be better. I know they are all starting out but hopefully during my 3rd visit it will have improved. Food is pretty good for the price. Place is spacious and is a great place to eat after shopping!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and while the ambience was great, they really need to work on customer service. The night started out great, but 20 minutes into our dinner, our waitress disappeared. She never came back to tell us she left for the night and that another person was going to wait her tables. This particular waiter was nice, but not very attentive. Our food came out really slow at this point, and then they forgot one order and got another one wrong.  Terrible.  We've been to a handful of other AYCE Korean BBQ places, and while the food here wasn't bad, it wasn't the greatest either. The portions were smaller and the appetizers not very appetizing. May be if the waiters were more attentive at helping customers, I would have had a better experience.  In fact, there were more workers cleaning tables and changing grills than there were employees waiting tables.  I sure as hell ain't hard to please. Great customer service goes a long way for me and I was sorely disappointed with the service and the night overall. My wife wasn't as critical of this place as I am, but she also wasn't happy.",

They help each other out so you won't need to have a table piling up with plates. I recommend their popcorn chicken, cajun shrimp, cajun calamari, pork bulgogi (marinated really well), prime steak and japchae (noodles). They also have soju (although I haven't tried theirs yet, maybe in the next visit)",

Place is very well spread out, their 6-person table has enough elbow space.  Parking is great as its located by the mall. Expect some wait time on the weekends at lunch if you get there late.  Price is just right for the buffet. My kids love the premium pork belly and KFC.  And the 2 hr limit is perfect for lunch, unless you have a big group.  The selections was a bit limited or didn't have enough variety. Looking for a few more inerts/more meat selections for some Korean Authenticity. I guess its catering to the customers.",

    "text": "The search for the best KBBQ in LV continues.... After my friend heard about this place on NPR and seeing so many great reviews, my friends and I made the long trek out to Henderson in search of some great AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ.  Unfortunately, this did not end up being the mecca of KBBQ we had hoped it to be...  Firstly, the decor was weird! It was very modern and young, like it was trying to cater to KPOP teenage fans or something. It was also way too clean to be authentic...If I can't smell the BBQ, that's not a good sign!  Second, the BBQ was only OK. At least they had bulgogi/steak/pork belly/ spicy pork....but they didn't have galbi....like no marinated bone in short ribs in sight! What? Also, the portion sizes when they came out were kinda small....but I guess since it's AYCE, it doesn't really matter. I will say that the jap chae noodles were garlicky and delicious and I may have ordered like 3 plates of it :) Also, for $20/pp it's a good deal.    Finally, the service was HORRIBLE. I mean, who are you hiring, Gen? High schoolers? These kids had no idea what was going on, told really odd/weird/inappropriate jokes, forgot to bring us multiple items (sauces, ordered meats, water), and honestly didn't listen to us half the time when we asked about items on the menu. For example: -- Us: \"what is the difference between the premium pork and the regular pork?\" Waiter: **stares at us, then walks away** -- Um, you could have even just said I don't know, but don't just ignore us!  *shakes my head*  Get it together, Gen! It's like amateur hour here!",

    "text": "Excited to try out this popular LA chain that's finally migrated to my home in Las Vegas, the impressive interior attempts to portray a higher quality establishment but fails with mediocre quality of meat.   Came here with a friend on a decently busy Wednesday night and was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. Typically kbbq places are pretty plain with poor ventilation and leaves one suffocating in smoke, and clothes soaked in kbbq sweat; however, gen knows this and did a great job at it.   Service: Friendly greeting by the hostess, attentive staff, and overall a pretty pleasant experience with the employees. Meat came out quicker than expected.  Apps: I wanted to save my room for the meat and only got the K.F.C. which are boneless yangyum style chicken thats marinated in a more tangy/sweet than spicy sauce. Like a much crispier orange chicken that was very good  Meat: We got the sirloin, brisket, tongue, pork belly, pork belly garilc, and galbi. All of which was pretty disappointing. The brisket lacked a good amount of fat that resulted in dry meat within 20 seconds of grilling, the galbi's marinade was a bit weak and didn't have the sweet goodness i'm used to enjoying. The pork belly garlic was very salty....  Bill: They do the tablet checkout method when it came to paying with a card (no discover accepted) but what i didn't like was the manager holding the tablet and watching me leave a tip which made me uncomfortable. I felt an unnecessary pressure for something I should be comfortable about doing.  Overall: Las Vegas lacks good kbbq and this one is no exception. I'd come back if i'm deeply craving it but otherwise wouldn't recommend it",

It is about $5 cheaper than all the AYCE Korean BBQ joints that i have been to so far, although all the ones i have been to may have been mainly in California. Since i have been to the GEN in Cali, i was expecting pretty much the same thing. I was WRONG.... i also decided to come here a little while after they had opened so that they could get all the trial stuff out of the way. They still have MORE to work on in my opinion.  We had one of the NEW servers take care of us which I THINK his name was YOUNG-UHN?.... ahahahha something along that line he was great service wise. Although his first day on his own he did quite well taking care of us especially w/ his up beat personality. He kept us up to date w/ anything that may have taken some time. A bit disappointed when we asked the manager for a refill on salad & did not get it right away especially when you are a manager...   The meat was OK... the best thing was the BEEF BELLY & MISO PORK BELLY. I typically love the PORK JOWEL meat but it had a nasty old stench to it & it wasn't even slices it was just the whole chunck of it =\\    REGARDLESS.... I probably may be back when I'm in the area... definitely would NOT go out of my way to crave it like I would in Cali.",

I ordered a variety of meats like I usually do, and of course it's a little busy, so a wait time is to be expected. But what really disappointed me was waiting 30 minutes for an appetizer, KFC chicken. When we started seeing multiple plates of it being served to other tables we asked what was going on? We were informed the fryer was not working and they were down to one. Eventually our chicken came out and it was cold.   At this point, we asked to speak to a manager. He came to our table and we asked him if he knew if the fryer was down. He seemed very confused. So not sure if a fryer was down or they just forgot about our dish. But either way, neither the manager or the waitress apologized/tried to make things right. Overall disappointed in how this was handled.",

They do have the meats and the flavor of those meats have hints of Korean flavor, but its clear that their goal is for you to throw on the feedbag and chow down. It is clear that they are not interested in their patrons enjoying an authentic Korean culinary experience. I can accept that. No gochujang? Ok, It's like the ketchup of Korean and you don't have it. Might as well just have the ban chan be dill pickles and olives.  My second visit had me fuming. I had a coupon and showed it to the waitress. She said ok and told me to give it to her when the bill came around. The meal was uneventful, aside from the shame of no gochujang. The bill came via the manager and I provide my coupon. He tells me they do not accept it anymore. I point out that it is not expired and I did show it to the server; she did not alert me to what he is telling me now. The manager tells me that they do not accept the coupon anymore, nothing he can do, it came down from corporate. I pointed to the waitress and said she told me to just give the coupon to her when the bill comes. The manager told me that staff is new, they are not trained.  Long story short, they did not honor my coupon. What made me angry was that the manager was argumentative and made no accommodation for the situation. No apology. The server essentially accepted the coupon when I showed it to her (as the coupon stated) and then the manager said J/K... ha ha.  Tip: the customer is NOT always right at this location.",

    "text": "Not that I've been to better korean bbq places it's just that I don't really care for this place, and my last visit left a sour taste in my mouth.  The first time I went was fine.  We had four people and got sat relatively quickly at a table with two grills.  We got our food and cooked.  The flame was really low so it took a long time to cook/eat but the experience was fine.    The second time was a mess.  We had 6 people this time and got crammed into a booth with one grill.  The place was really busy when we went so we weren't really expecting fast service but what we got was a snail's pace.  We got our drinks and free sides quickly enough but with those, our entire table was already filled up.  Like there wasn't any room to put anything!  We all ordered our food and it came out but the servers didn't have anywhere to put it so they kind of just looked at us to either finish the free sides (which are supposed to accompany the meal) or hold the sides so they could put the meats down.  None of us could eat at the same time and we had the grill so filled with food (one from each person, with one or two people left out bc of room) that the food took about 45 minutes to an hour to cook!  This was totally unacceptable but we couldn't complain because our servers didn't come back for another 45 minutes or so.  Our table was literally piled high with used dishes and empty plates, some 6 plates tall!  We got so upset at how long it was taking to cook the food that we decided to just order ready made dishes.  Half of what we ordered they said they were out of, even though the table next to us ordered the same food ten minutes after we did and got it promptly delivered.  We were honestly so pissed at this point.  I hate their two card policy, I hate how expensive it is when we are doing most of the work, I hate how little seasoning they give with your food, I hate how weak their grills are, and I don't understand why this place is so popular!  I am giving it 2 stars because of my first experience.  The last time I was there definitely gets a 1 star.    I will not be coming back here.",

    "text": "I love all kinds of food from street food to 5 star. However, I'm not always that adventurous when it comes to new and different foods unless I know what it is. I have learned to try more things the older I get and tonight was a perfect example of why we should try new things. The dinner was amazing and I lost count of my new firsts. I think I'll be full for the next few days! There were 7 of us and we tried at least  1/2 the menu items. There was nothing bad and some liked different items over the others. Quality ingredients and so many different flavors. One of our favs was the Volcano Chicken and they warn you but I'll add to that - it will clear your sinuses and we joked it made it so we could appreciate all the other flavors! I kept going back to it. One word of advice - start out with a few dishes at a time. Yes, it's AYCE but you don't want your table loaded with dishes and it's hard to cook and serve and worry about which plate had raw food. I watched other groups that did the few at a time, immediately dropped the meat/seafood/etc on the grill and handed back the empty dirty plate to the awesome servers and ordered more. Also, you can request new/clean cooktops which do get blackened after cooking. We weren't told this but saw other tables and then they replaced it several times. We will definitely be going back. The price for what you get is an added plus. When you're offered so many options, try something new. I'm so glad I did.",

Service is great, I love the staff there what a difference in treatment compared to Las Vegas. When it first opened, it was so busy I could not get in until an hour or two later.   Waiters and waitresses are very attentive to your requests, if they have it they will get it to you asap. Drinks are average price, it's understandable-they run out of special cocktails sometimes.  The decor is sleek and modern, the audience is very diverse. I would give it five if they start developing a customer's promotion system, give me a free meal for how many meals I already had at the place.  Fresh, modern, and tasty!",

Imagine this a food paradise tangled in with glass noodles a delicious doping sauce and flavored salt to blend right on your palette. Then imagine where you could ever find such a place right here nuzzled in a quaint corner of the galleria mask right next to Red Robin. I have been here three times now and have not experienced but one bad thing when the waitress for whatever reason decided to ignore me seemingly because I was by myself but water under the bridge after I got that amazing stuff in my belly I recommended the beef tongue and filet order often and in excess it dies get crowded the glass noodles are spectacular! Also if your are of age try the soju it's delicious here and during happy hour fairly well priced too.",

Waited 10 mins and was seated in a booth with a high chair as requested. When we arrived we were starving! Our waitress was awesome from start to finish! Customer service is very important to me because im a waitress myself and of course who doesnt want a great experience dining out. We have like 5 rounds of meats. Everything tasted good. We tried their calamari, gyoza, fried korean chicken, spicy tofu soup. OMG that soup was delicious. We requested a lot of things from our waitress. Each time she provided it with us with a smile and her body language was again great! I would definitily come here again!",

We ask do they have big table for 11 they said they have it. We got in and they divided to 2 tables 10 and ... and then they told us he AC is broken. Why T heck didn't you tell me on the phone when I called in. Made me drive for 35 mins now tell me that ????  Moreover, when I got to the address I called and asked I can't see their store? The one on the phone said find your way here. I said I had the address. I'm here and I saw Jc penny n Macy's but I don't see Gen. she replied there are so many Jc penny n Macy's. Find ur own way to get here. I'm like WTF???  We got in they said 2 hrs for each table but looked what happened they took 30-45 mins for the food after our first round. It wasn't that busy.  Will you come here? Again?   Am I too picky? Of course not  They we were being rude to us first.",

I told him where I sat and as soon as he walked over, the hostess, assistant manager, and shift manager were so quick to assume that he was there to free load the AYCE and kicked him out. They all approached us and created a scene to explain the policy. Uhh...we would've paid the extra $20 to have the additional party join us, but don't just assume he showed up eat there!  And after all that scene, the assistant manager was about to make the exception after I kept arguing with him. Sad to say, we won't be going back there again. Maybe it's time to hire more mature staff who can handle those situations better regardless of the policy you are trying to enforce.",

We arrived for dinner Sunday around 5 and it was not that busy which is really nice! Towards the middle of our dinner I noticed the crowd for bigger so I do recommend showing up a little early if you are going to have dinner with a much larger group. I love how the longer tables are set up with 3 grills and seats up to 8 people, 4 on each side so it gives a interactive vibe. Our server Ozzy was absolutely over the top amazing! He checked on us many times and made sure we always got what we requested and treated us very well! He was also very nice about recommending certain dishes! Lastly I highly suggest trying the macaron ice cream sandwhiches, especially the vanilla or green tea!! We will most likely be returning again soon!!",

    "text": "Fair price for all you can eat Korean bbq; however, there is reason to mention that this place lacked the authenticity of Korean bbqs I experienced in Korea. The meat is average quality and you're definitely getting the quality that matches the price. The portions are relatively small, but each person in your party receives up to 34 menu selections - including the sides. The steaks and galbi are pretty decent and probably the best value of the all you can eat menu. If you are a fan of Sundubu (spicy tofu stew) like they have in Korea, I don't recommend their side of it. It was pretty watery and not hot at all. My friend ordered the sesame chicken and it was overcooked, extremely dry, and lacking in sauce and flavor. The samgyupsal ( pork belly) selections were absolutely delicious, especially the pork belly marinated in red wine. I would also recommend the chabol (thinly sliced pieces of beef). Service was divided in quality in aspects of who was serving you. Individuals check in periodically to see what you'd like to order and also change out the stove (whenever you feel) to maximize the flavor of the meat. The menu was lacking in the side selections in comparison to other korean bbqs, such as steamed egg and bean paste stew.   Overall, this place doesn't even come close to other Korean bbqs I have experienced. If you are in the mood to eat a ton of meat, want to ease into the korean bbq experience,  or looking for an easy place to fill yourself up, I recommend this place to satisfy those desires. You can't expect highly of all you can eat bbqs, but this one is pretty decent. It does beat the other restaurant selections in the galleria and is a nice place to stop after shopping and running errands. It really depends on what you're ordering, but personally I'd invest in a better quality bbq if it was a nice occasion.",

Our waiter was not very helpful at all. Yes he was attentive but at least explain to us what is included instead of saying 'uhh, you have to get a appetizer, it's included in the meal.' UHH, well if you don't explain this to us, then we don't know.  What killed the experience was when we ordered our second plate of brisket. Honestly, I don't think that was brisket. Usually brisket is thin and cooks quick. This took forever to cook and was chewy as heck. It was not good. And when we tired to ask the waiter if it was indeed brisket, he got all rude and said 'well that's what you order right?' Okay, thank you but I'm not coming back after that.",

Warning: no lunch pricing on the weekends.   We arrived and sides were already at our table, never seen that before. Server was quick to take our order and bring us out items. Long story short, we were in and out within 45 minutes. Super impressive for us given all LA locations always have at least 45 minute wait to be seated.   Overall, quick, delicious and clean location for lunch.",

I do not say this lightly, Blake was by far one of the best servers I've ever had ANYWHERE. He's a hard worker and would recommend coming here simply because of the service.

Also, his profile links to his Facebook, which shows he works at Gen Korean BBQ House.  Enough about their gaming the system, to artificially inflate the ratings for this new Korean BBQ joint in Henderson. My wife and I were unsure where to go, as she is half Korean, we eat at a LOT of Korean BBQ places, in Vegas, and on the road. Galleria's newest food additions all look amazing from the outside, and this place was busy for a Monday night! The check-in process was great, you give a #, they text you your progress in queue.   We were seated, and had the standard corporate greeting, \"Is this your first time eating here with us? Oh, great, let me explain...\" of course it is, you have only been open a couple days. Our server had minimal knowledge of the food, but brought out our drinks rather quickly. And then, a second person came to bring our drinks out. Overly efficient, or inept duplication?  Our food was ordered, after being told there is a two hour time limit for the AYCE foods. The menu looked like there was a wide selection of options. Our first round of meats came out, and only two of them were right.  So, they brought out 2x the drinks, and 50% wrong food to start. My wife ordered edamame, and was brought out a salad.   When they delivered the meats, they gave my wife her boneless Kalbi rib type option, and put down some thinly sliced meat, and said it was spicy pork. They dropped off chicken and what they said was bulgogi to me.  Spicy pork is coated in a red paste, but she gave it a try, just in case. It was beef bulgogi. When correcting it, they took the beef bulgogi, and brought out spicy pork. What they told me was bulgogi was pork. It took a while to get the right food brought out, after having our server tell me that beef turns white, depending on the marinade used. Ummmm. No. Pork turns white, beef turns brown, please try again. That got straightened out, thanks to a California trainer.    As to the flavor... the chicken bulgogi tasted like burnt soy sauce, and the beef bulgogi was just flavorless mush.  After that... We only saw our server as he spent 20+ minutes chatting with a guy two tables over. Other tables around us were heard asking random employees, \"Who is our server?!\" We waited, and waited to pay. Finally, we just got up and went to the hostess. They aren't supposed to get our check for us, but did. Upon giving them a quick rundown of how our visit went, they got the GM. He is a very nice guy, who took our feedback, as a manager should, and said he would address the issue with his staff.",

    "text": "OK so I was excited to try this place because I've had great Korean barbecue back in Los Angeles. My husband had never had Korean barbecue so I wanted to take him somewhere. The food was mediocre. But let's start with a list of complaints and suggestions. The soda machine was apparently out of order I heard one waiter telling another waiter that it had been down since 10 AM, mind you we were there for dinner for about a 730PM time frame. (you would think on a Saturday probably one of their largest revenue days of the week they would have a repair man come out and look at it and get it fixed in a timely manner?). First disappointment but we moved on. They give you scissors and tongs to cook the food on the grill. Typically you are using the scissors for raw meat so it's not something you necessarily want to use again after the food is cooked. They give you Chopstix to eat with--the waiter asked if we wanted forks, we both said yes yet, they were never brought to us. No knife to cut the meat after cooked...didn't want to use the scissors that were used for raw meat...  My next complaint would be the lighting,I understand that they are trying to create an ambience and set a mood, however, any place where you are cooking your own meat and trying to see if it is still raw, this is a poor decision to have such poor lighting. The lighting is so low it was nearly impossible to check the meat if it was still raw.   They had our grill really low and our food was taking forever to cook. We asked one waiter to turn it up and every time our waiter walked by he'd turn it down. Rinse repeat. This happened 5x during our stay. The grill controls are also on an awkward place in the booths, so it's difficult to control yourself. The one I ate at in LA had them on the table so it was easy to turn down when your meat was finished cooking etc.   On a positive note, they were very attentive about drinks and changing out our grill top when needed.",

But unfortunately, I think it should be a soft opening since they didn't have a lot of items on the menu.   My body was so ready to dine at a decent kbbq in Vegas since there are really none worth mentioning around here/worth the price lol.  I was taken by surprise with the items that they had because they had Cajun fries!!!!!!!!! But of course, they didn't have it :-( They also didn't have gyoza, tofu, or any teas.   Meats are ok, but to me... the Cali locations taste a lot better. I love love love the garlic pork belly, but for some reason it just had a weird after taste lol. Brisket was pretty dry as well, even when we tried to cook it medium.   What I did like was that they serve Japchae in big portions!!!! My fav. The KFC Chicken was pretty good too, a little too saucy, but still good.   The service is A1, they try their best.   I've been to two of the locations in Cali & this one just disappointed me a little. But I hope the employees don't get discouraged because you are all doing the best you can & I see the hard work you all are putting in :-) Customers should understand that it's the grand opening and should be a little nicer to the workers for things they have no control of!   I know this place will do well though because there aren't many kbbq places in Vegas and Gen is pretty well known.   GG LV.",

    "text": "I've been to many Korean BBQ joints and this place is definitely a bit fancier than the ones you find in China Town. The meat selection is very impressive and you get your average Korean BBQ experience when it comes to taste. The only couple of complaints I have is that its always packed (my fault for always going during dinner time) and the amount of space on the table for plates. If you have a big party, you will definitely be combining plates to make some extra room to eat.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place for a while on the recommendation of a friend of mine. Make sure to get there early - they do not take reservations. (And an FYI - they only do \"lunch\" pricing on the weekdays. Dinner pricing applies all day in the weekends).  For $15.99 (for lunch) on the weekdays or $19.99 for dinner, you get an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord of appetizers (they never have the fries - ever) and specialty meats and sides. You had better know how to use a grill, or else you may have a difficult time cooking your food here - you cook it - the staff does not.  The staff are polite and happy to explain how the place works. However - if you have leftover food, you will face additional charges to your bill for wasting it. I've never had that issue, but the warning is there. You also have only two hours - or else you will get charged for another dinner if you decide to sit around! The staff are quite busy here, and it seems to be quite disorganized. We waited for almost 20 minutes for refills on water. If your grill gets dirty (read: charred) they will happily change it for you though.  I suggest the brisket and the roast beef. The marinated meats (especially the chicken) are difficult to cook right and burn easily because of the sugars involved. The pickled radishes and mashed potatoes are good, too.  I would suggest this place for the price, and give it 4 stars, but -1 star for the madness of disorganization. Happy eating!",

    "text": "The food is really good, but they really need to work out their service issues. There seems to be varying levels of experience in the waitstaff. I started by ordering some hot tea, and the server tells me they don't have it so I pointed it out on the menu. He says again that they don't have it which I took to mean that they ran out?? I then asked if the green tea is sweetened and he says a little bit but they can always make it sweeter. I said I actually don't want sweetened tea so I ordered an unsweetened ice tea and he proceeds to ask if I want sugar packets. I got the sense he's new to waiting tables and doesn't know how to veer off from script.  He then comes back 5 minutes later and apologizes for forgetting to start up our grill. He walks away and we had to flag him down to take our order. That was the last we saw of him. After that we were waited on by a girl who seemed more comfortable at interacting with people.   I noticed the table next to us was asked whether they wanted their grill changed out while they were still cooking their food. Uh, where are they supposed to put the raw meats in the meantime? We weren't asked whether we wanted our grill changed until we were ready for our check. I think management should work on establishing more consistency.  We quite enjoyed our meal until it came time to pay. I think this restaurant is trying too hard to be hip. Instead of having your server take your payment or going to the front of the restaurant to pay, you have to wait for the designated person to come to you with a handheld card reader. Our server apologized for the wait and said there would be no wait if we paid cash. Doesn't the restaurant realize people don't carry cash anymore? And don't they realize they are a full-service restaurant and not a little food truck or cafe? There were so many irritated people waiting to pay it was unbelievable.   Please invest in a regular cash register. I understand it takes away the coolness factor, but it'll make your customers so much happier. Here's a tip to fellow diners, ask to pay your bill 30 minutes before you're ready to leave.",

    "text": "This place is way over-hyped, I don't see what's so great about it. Came in around lunch time since I was in the area and it was busy so we waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The whole restaurant was pretty dark and playing loud music.  We got seated at one of the high bar tables, in which there was barely any room to put our plates. There was only 4 dishes of banchan, which is really small compared to other kbbq places. They didn't even taste good, nor were they ever offered to be refilled once the plate was empty.  Our waiter came immediately to take our drink order and then our food order. He disappeared after that and we never saw him again. We had to ask the busser in order to get more food. Our water was never refilled and we had to ask 4 times.  Whoever gave our food to us didn't seem to want to be there. She just mumbled the name of the meat, slammed it on the table and walked off. This happened every time, it made me not even want to order anymore. It also took a while for our dirty dishes to be taken away. I asked for an extra bowl of rice, waited a bit and it never came - so I asked another girl. Waited again and it never came. I asked one more person and it finally came after 20 minutes. The food came out pretty fast but it was alright, nothing special.   The service here was shitty. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You're better off going somewhere near china town.",

There was a 3rd person standing at the host stand on their phone they seemed by far the nicest with out saying a word or giving a glance at us. On the plus side the place looked cool inside the whole 30 seconds of my visit. So much for the 4 stars.",

    "text": "First, I'll begin by stating that I'm from LA and have also lived in OC, and I've also been to Seoul, so my standard for kbbq is pretty damn high. To be fair, I'm not going to compare this place to my spots in Cali because Gen doesn't stand a chance for many reasons. On that note, I think it's common knowledge that the kbbq scene in Las Vegas is pretty weak and leaves much to be desired. Sorry, but it's True.  Enter Gen House. First impression: Ohh my my my.. The atmosphere is definitely chic, like something you should come to expect for a kbbq spot in Las Vegas (I know it's in Henderson, but whatever). Gen is centrally located in a mall, so parking is of no issue. Waiting in line, however, can be sporadic, much like most kbbq places.  Like I said earlier, I can't compare this place with my spots in Cali, but I can, however, compare the service. Enter Jaenica (heart and music note). She was simply amazing; I couldn't ask for a better server. Seriously, she's the best, I can't emphasize that enough. She catered to our needs very quickly and was very entertaining to talk to--cute, too.  There's nothing much to say as far as the food goes, other than that it was pretty standard for what you would expect for a ayce kbbq. Nonetheless, I do have two gripes: kimchi and bean sprouts. I don't even know where to begin, but of all the sides, kimchi reigns supreme and should not be compromised. The ones we got were watery and were mainly the rooted end of the cabbage--very disappointing. On the other hand, the bean sprouts, second in line to the throne, is missing in action! Where are my bean sprouts?! Seriously, Gen, get it together.  All things considered, I definitely recommend this place for your ayce kbbq needs. This is the spot in Vegas, hands down, no doubt about it. Still in all, I'm inclined to give Gen only 3 stars because of the kimchi and bean sprouts ordeal. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but these are Korean staples, so add more love in the kimchi and bring on the bean sprouts! But to sum it up, this place deserves 4 stars since Jaenica made such a great impression on me with her outstanding service and witty humor. I shall return--bookmarked.",

They take us to the tables.  Yes!! We were seated at 2 seperate tables then was told we would be charged an 18% gratuity for party of 6 or more.  We then ask for a manager and was sent an inexperienced hostess as a reprensentative for a manager.  We told her how long we waited just to be seated at 2 separate tables as a family and on top an 18% gratuity for 6 or more.  The hostess then blames us and says \"Did you tell the hostess you wanted to sit together?  If not then thats not our fault.\"  Last time I checked saying party of 8, its implied and common sense says we're here together to sit together and eat together.  I have never ever been seated at different tables  w/large parties in my life. We could have only waited10-20 mins to sit seperatly instead of almost an hour 20 mins.  Then I asked her to justify the 18% gratuity.  We were split up, we are no longer a party of 8, there is only 4 being served in our group.  We should have left then.  We ordered drinks and 2 drinks didn't come til meal was almost over after notifying them numerous times that we're still waiting for drinks.  Same with food, everytime we put an order in they forgot 1 or 2 items and after asking and being told it was on its way, it never came.  I don't know how the other half of our party faired but I doubt it went well.  They didn't look happy and left about 45mins before our group.  I've been here many times and would rate it a 3.5 but after this last experience, I doubt I'll/we'll go back or recommend it to friends/family. This is the 1st I've ever asked to speak to a manager, hopefully last.",

Kristina was our server and she was wonderful! order always came out right which is impressive considering they've been open less than a week.   we will definitely be putting Gen on our rotation of fav places to eat.",

She greeted our party of 7 and went straight to asking what we'd like to drink and what we'd like to order right away. We enjoyed her service very much. Thanks Susana, we won't give up on Gen just yet!",

    "text": "I came back again.  I'm adding a star. Had a friend visiting from Germany and I figured he'd eat his fill of typical food available on the strip.  This would be fun and tasty.  My server tonight was on it. He changed our grill and offered food at appropriate times. The music selection was phenomenal (Friday night).  Drinks were excessively slow coming out. This was obvious after eating the KFC and having meats already cooked, still no drinks. I don't get the holdup on that. The thin sliced ribeye wasn't as tender as normal. Otherwise, this was a good trip.    Some confusion when it comes to bar seating.  We were going to sit down and the bartender walked away to ask the front.  While he's doing this three people walk over and basically push us out of the way and sit down.  They were not seated by the front staff.  Whatever! I waited the hour wait next door at the beer place.   I've eaten here many times in the past year and a half. I love that they have booths, my preferred seating situation. I've sat at the non booths before and found it less comfortable and intimate.    The meats are normally very consistent.  With my last trip, last week, there was an excessive amount of fat on one of the beef orders.  I think it was the bulgogi. It was still tasty.  My annoyance was our server.  He seemed way out of it. Not returning to see if we had our order. Didn't check the grill before we were choking from burning fat juice. We reorder meats after flagging him down and he forgets. Remind him that he forgot and he doesn't put in the full order.  He was just overall weird.  Told us the history behind his name (Z) and said it was because he's a loser and always last like the alphabet. I don't want to hear this. I can't be a therapist for my server. I just want to eat and not choke to death.   I'll go back but I will ask for a new server if need be. We should not wait for extended periods in an AYCE restaurant that is only required to bring raw meats.",

    "text": "First Impression: Holy smokes this place looks incredible. The restaurant appears to be very clean. The staff are kind and the borrow looks well stocked. The tables are extremely clean and set to perfection.  Food: Gen is a buffet style all-you-can-eat for 2 hours. I've been to a few Korean barbecues over time, and this by far is my first choice due to the large selection they have. When you have so many choices to choose from, sometimes it can be overwhelming.... However they have just the right amount of choices to keep you smiling. A huge plus to this restaurant is the free refills on drinks. I've been to some places where you pay $2 for tiny can of soda and this restaurant understands a good value.    For those of you who have never been to a Korean Style BBQ, there is a grill in the center of the table where you grill your food yourself and I was pleased with the size of the grill. I've been to some places in the past where the grill is a tad smaller leaving you with less food. Oh and yes the food is amazing.....  Cost: It's a very good price for an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. Somewhere in the ballpark of $20.  Cleanliness: This restaurant had it. Everywhere I looked have been cleaned. The floors, the tables, the walls. It was aparent that the owners of this restaurant care a great deal about what it looks like, and how the cleanliness affects a person's meal. Huge +1.        however the cleanliness factor doesn't just fall to the front of the house. The restrooms were also very tidy and clean. All the tissue paper and paper towels seem to be well stocked with no issues, and in the areas you would think they would be some dirtiness..... There was none. Hats off to Gen.  Staff: The staff were extremely pleasant and polite. if you have a question they never made you feel out of place and we're always able to answer the question promptly and appropriately. There are a lot of choices to choose from on the menu and they were able to help guide you through the process if your new there. Every time the grill got dirty with burntness, the staff were right there ready to swap out the grill cover for you. Awesome....  Overall: I would 100% return here as I already have and will continue to do so. I'm very picky on where I eat and Gen Korean BBQ has lived up to my expectations. With the staff being respectful, kind and knowledgeable as well as the restaurant being as clean as it was, this just adds to the fact that the food is absolutely amazing. it has become one of my favorite restaurants here in Las Vegas, and I think it's only fair that I blurt my review out about it so that everybody knows how great it is.  Note: Unfortunately I forgot my phone in the car so I was not able to take any pictures but trust me when I tell you everything in this review should paint a beautiful picture",

I had zero expectations and left with being so satisfied.   1. The interior is nice. When you walk in, it's  dark and spacious with high ceilings. I'm also a sucker for cool lighting. It's clean and seems like a perfect spot for a date.   2. The price is actually really great especially since it's at the mall, all you can eat, and high quality meats.   3. Customer service isn't  terrible but the second time coming here, our waiter kept forgetting several things to the point where the entire table noticed it.   4. Location is obviously great. You're at the Galleria Mall and the most popular area of West Henderson. Most of mall restaurants are just average  so Galleria is really stepping it up.  Come here if you live in Henderson and don't  want to drive all the way to Las Vegas to get some good KBBQ. It's  definitely legit.",

    "text": "The convenient location in Henderson and the affordable price make Gen one of the top choices for a hungry carnivore like myself. Even though they recently raised the AYCE price a dollar (dinner $21.99), everyone including the light eaters in my family, can still get value for the cost.  We avoided the location probably the first 6 months after opening because it was so busy, but now we hardly ever have to wait, even at peak times. You can either sit in a booth in the dining area as soon as you walk in, or at a high top in the dining area to the right. Both areas are dimly lit with fluorescent blue lamps providing most of the illumination. Service has been consistently good for us with an occasional server that isn't with the program yet.  There were recent menu changes with some additions and subtractions. You'll still get the regular unlimited banchan served in small dishes with an order of salad and jap chae waiting for you when you are seated. The number of meats available has been condensed, but with 36 items, there is still a sufficient amount to find the ones of your liking. Just order by number, and within two or three minutes you'll start receiving your meats once the server enters them on the their ordering pad. Cooking your own meat is something I've become less a fan of because it takes a serious chunk out of your eating time, especially when you come with two or three other hosses that'll clear the grill before you can say, \"save me some pork belly.\"  The premium steak (#1), chadol (brisket, #4), signature galbi (#10), premium pork belly (#18), Korean fried chicken (#29), and shrimp (#31) usually kick off the feast for us. While not the highest quality meat I've had compared to other joints, there aren't too many AYCE places where I can fill up for a better price.",

Order the KFC Appetizer, Jap Chae glass noodles, and gyoza to start. I normally order two or more orders of the KFC because it's just that delicious! We've recently switched from white rice to rice paper which helps us save some room for more meats. You should try it!   Red wine pork belly, Gen signature steak, spicy pork bulgogi, and lots and lot and lots of Gen Chadol which is the brisket. We order all those over and over again till we're full!   They also come with sides that are already available at the table upon sitting down. I usually only eat the fish cake, sweet potato and kimchie. The rest I kinda just push aside. They're kind enough to get me some more of my favorite sides if they see you run out.   You can also ask them to change your grill when you feel like it's a little gross from all the cooking. They'll gladly do it for you. This place always has a good amount of staff working and will always have people constantly checking on you throughout your meal.   Aura of the place is nice. My BF especially likes the old school songs they play in the background.   Will always be back!",

I came up to Vegas for my friends birthday and of course we wanted to do ALL YOU CAN EAT. BBQ is also her favorite so it was perfect.  It was basically ~$20 and you get to order as much as you want. Just make sure that you eat everything because they will charge you if you have too much left over stuff.  I really love the khalbi and the Teri beef...  all their little sides are also really good. I always have to order more of them.   I think the best way to do these kinda all you can eat is to do family style and just share everything so that you get to eat a little bit of everything. Everything comes out relatively fast because you grill it yourself.    On a side note, our waiter was really cute and I thought the food runners were also easy on the eyes  so that's just a bonus!",

I understand the idea of everyone serving you for a faster service, but it was not executed very well. Instead, they seemed confused and often there were tons of miscommunication or missed orders.

One of the best things about Gen is how they run their wait list system. You first give your name and phone number to the hostess and when your table is ready, Gen will text you. I really enjoy this system because you don't have to stay in the restaurant the whole time. You can go into the mall and go shopping!!!  The Staff: 5/5 I've never experienced any issues with their staff! They're very quick putting orders in on the I-pads they carry around, speedy at delivering orders and re-filling drinks, and excellent at replacing the grills. All of the staff I have come across have been very friendly and helpful.  Food: 5/5 Compared to many other KBBQ places, Gen has so many more options! Some of my favorite meats include the Red Wine Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgolgi, and the Premium Beef Short Ribs. My favorite side dish is their Kimchi!  The Prices: 5/5 The price is amazing! I think it's one of the cheapest and best KBBQ places in Las Vegas. If you live far away, the drive is worth it, believe me! For AYCE lunch it is $15.99 and for AYCE dinner the price is $20.99.",

She's very attentive and I appreciate her taking a little bit of her time to get to know what kind of meats we liked and suggesting her favorites. Our waters, brisket sauce, and sides are always refilled right away and with her, she offers to have our grill changed before we even think of it ourselves. I would give this place a 5 star if we're basing this review off of her and her service alone.  We had a different guy this last time and his service was okay, leaning more towards blah. It seemed to me that he cannot handle all the tables he decided to take on that day. Even with others delivering the food, refilling our waters and changing our grill, it still took him a long time to come back and check on us. It was to the point where our grill was so burnt that we had to flag someone down four times to get it changed. He disappeared in the back of the house for about 15 mins which made me wonder if he was also slicing the food back there. One star off for this guys service.   Their food is delicious though. I always order lots and lots of Gen Chadol (Brisket) and Pork Belly. I do prefer the pork belly with a little fat because sometimes the brisket is a little dry for me. The signature steak (#1 on the menu) is great when they're cut at a perfect size. Too thin, it shrinks, and too thick is hard to chew. Red wine pork belly is a must and also the miso pork belly.   Lunch price is $14.99!",

    "text": "Geez, 600+ reviews?!  Many of these reviews lack merit, but...   True fact: A LOT of people do come here. It is very busy all the time. Even on this unassuming Tuesday evening.  Friends that I know are not Yelpers are repeat customers.  Pro-tip: Be smart about the time you come or be prepared to wait. I have never waited more than 15-20 minutes the two times I've been here.  Arriving Tuesday at 6:40 PM. Seated at 7:00 PM. Dined 7:00-9:00.  I could see the hangry folks waiting from my table. The waiting area was packed from 7:00-9:00. Meaning diners like myself ate for 2 hours. No table turnover. Duh. So come early or come really late. You're welcome.  #1 - Gen signature steak - Want to feel like a pro chef? Season that baby with the salt and pepper from the little dipping dish. Bam!  #3 - Gen chadol - thinly sliced brisket. Get this. Like at least two times. It cooks very fast!  #5 - Gen beef bulgogi - thinly sliced, marinated sweet and savory. We got this twice. It comes with onions, get those on the grill too!  #8 - Beef tongue - Not bad!  #10 - Gen yangyum galbisal - marinated premium steak. Pretty good!  #15 - Spicy pork bulgogi - Great flavor! Not too spicy.  (In general, not a chicken fan when it comes to KBBQ)  Pork belly options:   #17 - Smoked garlic pork belly - Least favorite. Garlic flavor was weak.  #18 - Red wine pork belly - Yummy! You can really taste the red wine.   #19 - Miso pork belly - Yummy! Very tasty!  Seafood options? Too full to consider, but we did try the #22 garlic calamari and it was okay.  Other food items: - Salad - Very good and fresh tasting - KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - A bit sad. Not my favorite. - Tofu appetizer - Looks nothing like the photo on menu. Grossly heavy breading. Skip.  - Gyoza - Not mind blowing in any way. We got three times though. The kiddos enjoyed the crunchy treat. - White rice - Needs a lot of improvement. For an Asian establishment, do not serve hard rice okay? - Jap chae - 2 orders were sufficient for 5 adults. Not bad, not the best. - Rice paper - not available. Boo! - Radish paper - pretty good actually. - Spicy tofu soup - It was okay. Did not taste \"authentic.\"  Did I enjoy my meal? Yes. Would I come again? Yes.  This really is a generous 4, considering some flaws with customer service. I liked the food, so I'm not complaining.",

    "text": "Bomb Korean BBQ for a bomb price. $20 AYCE dinner??? Count me in! Service is incredible and everyone is so sweet. I was never a fan of pork belly until I went to Gen, simply because no one really flavored their pork belly. But this was also back then when we didn't have all of these other KBBQ spots that have been opening up these past few years.  Their red wine pork belly is SO AMAZING!! Must try!! Smoked garlic is good too but the red wine... it's a must. I love pork belly now, way more than I used to love brisket. Which is a lot. I also recommend the Hawaiian steak I think it is..? It's some type of steak on the menu and it's so good.   They offer tons of options for dinner, including various appetizers. One being a spicy fried chicken that had me spitting fire... and I love spicy food. That chicken was something else.  I hate that gen opened up in Henderson, because it's so far so I'm hoping they open another location closer to my side of town sometime in the near future.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for lunch today. Apparently they don't have any lunch specials for the weekends so we were forced to pay the all you can eat dinner price. Which was fine considering you have the option of a lot of different menu items.  Let's just say the food was awful. Not worth the price at all. The slices of chicken they give you to cook are large and misshapen, very hard to cook on an open flame, no knife to cut them up to make sure that each area of the chicken was fully cooked.  This would be fine if we were eating beef, but chicken is very dangerous to potentially eat raw. I found myself biting around areas of chicken to make sure it wasn't raw.   The side dishes that are already at your table when you arrive look like they've been sitting out all afternoon. And they don't remove the plates that your raw food comes on so you're basically sitting next to raw poultry juice all while eating your meal. The food that you can order that's already cooked clearly looks like it's been sitting out as well.  Also the restaurant is just generally filthy, bus tub (dish carts) everywhere. And food crumbs on the seat and floor.  I can honestly say I left feeling sick. Paid $40 to leave hungry and grossed out.",

    "text": "* Let me first say something, I've tried other kbbq restaurants, but this is, by-far, my favorite lbbq of them all. They give so many sides that the table is basically full and I LOVE the sides. This is probably my 3rd time eating there and it ceases to disappointment.   * Once you walk into Gen, you get a feel of the aesthetic look of the restaurant. It looks like it would be one of those super expensive restaurants you'd find at the strip, but let me tell you something, the price is great! For all-you-can-eat, it's $16 for lunch and $20.99 for dinner. It sets a great romantic mood because of the darkness and pastel lights. It's usually busy there but it's really nothing to be worried about. The wait to be seated was very short; sometimes there's no wait at all. Although, on the days it's really busy, it's kind of hard to get the waiters attention so you could order more.   * For the sides, they give clear noodles, kimchi, spicy pickled cucumbers, rice cakes, peas, salad, and others (I'm not sure what they are tbh). They all taste amazing and I could basically just eat them and get full. But anyways. We (2 of us) lasted for about 4 rounds of orders. Our favorite orders would probably be the Gen Chadol (beef brisket), Gen Beef Bulgolgi (marinated beef), and Chicken Bulgolgi (marinated chicken). Of course we've tried a bunch others and they're just as amazing. They're all flavorful and not bland like other meats in some kbbq's.   * Would I go there again? YES!!! I have and will continue to do so. So far, it still marks as the best kbbq for me.   * Rate 10/10 * $",

    "text": "There was a time I had given up on the KBBQ in Vegas. The quality was either terrible (Tofu Hut) or the price was just outrageous (Woonam Jung). But fear not, deer friends, Gen Korean Bbq house is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the situation, hopefully, in order to execute the awesomeness of the situation, and finding that shining light, that wherever it takes us, we will find a way to succeed. I don't know what that last sentence was, I was on a roll. And sometimes, it's just hard for me to stop. Like the copper top. Who likes to drop. Bippity bop.  Gen Korean comes by the way of California, a chain that has proven its popularity, particularly the Tustin location. This is also the only ayce kbbq in the Henderson area. I've heard the buzz and wanted to check out their stuff. I also heard it through the grapevine that they had something called 'rice paper'. I was like \"Rice paper?!?\". And then I left to try it out.  For some of you who have trouble finding it, Gen is located on a new part of the Galleria Mall that had been built out. For some reason, I thought it was near like the Sauce restaurant and stuff. But it wasn't, it was connected to the mall. So look at the mall, and you should be able to see it. There is a sign. A big one. A very big one.  Walking in, I liked the interior. It was modern, new, and fresh. But, it didn't feel too uptight or rigid. And you know I'm all about that. And then some. Picked out a boothy (boo), and started perusing the menu. One thing I noticed as I was about to order was that there were none of those huge air vents that are normally located above the grills on a kbbq table. Then I looked at the grill. Ermahgerd! They have the side vents that are located right next to the grills to suck up all that smoke! The only other place I saw this at was at Gyu-Kaku, and I thought that this was the greatest thing in the world. Right there Gen (Bennifer), you've got a big fan right ova' heah!  Onto the food itself. There weren't a lot of misses, but of course there is on every menu, so I shall inform you. Popcorn skrimpy's. If you're expecting Taiwanese popcorn skrimps, you will be disappointed. These are more of the Chili's or Applebee varieties. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The other people I was with thought that all the other appetizers and sides were good though. And normally, my favorite thing to eat at a Kbbq is kalbi (marinated short ribs). I thought the ones here were OK. The meat quality is very good, but I felt as though the meat could have been marinated for a longer period of time. It tasted more like a steak. And steak is great. But kalbi... I need a bit more of that flava flav, catch my drift ;). And the skrimps (the ones you grill). I'll go on record by saying that I've never had good skrimps to grill on a kbbq in Vegas. That trend will most likely continue.  Everything else was rock solid. The banchan is really good here. All the other meats that I've tried were excellente. Keep an eye on that #9, that beef short plate. T-ara was right about that one (I applaud you if you got that). One of the best meats I've had at a kbbq in a looong time. Surprisingly, their bulgogi (thin marinated sirloin) is probably the best in Vegas. Haven't had a good one in a while, and this one was really good. Probably a close second to the short plate. All the meats here are amazing and the grill is heated perfectly to cook them all.   The service was good here. I've read the reviews and it looked like it would have been inconsistent, but it seems that Gen is constantly working on it, and for myself, it was probably one of the better services that I had at any kbbq in town. My drinks were always filled, and so were the banchan. They were also taking our orders quickly after we had finished our meats, so I was impressed.  Gen is my go-to Kbbq in Vegas. This place has everything I'm looking for when I go out to one, and so far, stands head above the rest in town. Oh and Gen's famous rice paper. B to the omb.",

We arrived at 10:40 pm and last call was at 11:30 pm. Plenty of time for us to enjoy it all since we've had experience with kbbq under our belt. We were seated immediately and our server Ozzy greeted us and from the very beginning he led us into a great dining experience.   The food was delish, Ozzy made sure we were always doing ok, and he even offered to change out the grill multiple times. Even though it was late into his shift he always had a smile on his face. Everything was great!   The boyfriend and I will definitely come back.",

Whenever restaurants from California and other places develop a location in Vegas, it is always nice to know that I don't have to travel too far to go to a place like Gen again. Even though Gen is 30 minutes away from where I live, I would be down to make a trip to Henderson just to get Korean BBQ!  Compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas, Gen Korean BBQ house has one of the best deals for AYCE! It is only $14.95 for lunch and $19.95 for dinner! Even though their AYCE cost is cheaper than other places, Gen's meat quality is excellent! From their beef brisket to their marinated pork belly, everything is very delicious at Gen. Gen is the only place I would enjoy eating pork belly because I believe that other Korean BBQ places cannot compete with the pork belly that Gen offers! In addition, Gen has A TON of choices for AYCE menu items that you can go from your basic brisket and bulgogi to delicious Korean fried chicken and japchae. Gen is also the only KBBQ place in Southern Nevada that has rice paper! I have been waiting for a KBBQ place to come that offers rice paper because eating KBBQ meat with rice paper is WAAAAY better than eating KBBQ meat with your typical bowl of rice.  Whether you have to make a 30+ minute trip to deep Henderson like me or even live close to this place, Gen Korean BBQ House is definitely worth going to!",

That's what 'd five star is for. Being in 'd food industry myself, I know what I needed from my server so I can completely enjoy my time 'nd food. She had to take care of a group (9ppol) 'nd she didnt just left us there hanging but took 'd time to let us know ahead of time that she might take a minute to check up on us again if we needed more food.   Well about 'd AYCE KBBQ, $20.95 for dinner is worth it. I give it 4 stars based on the number of meats 'nd seafood you can choose from including the appetizers. 'd 5th star is probably lacking on flavor comparing to all other kbbq I have tried. But all 'nd all it's not bad. The ambiance of the place is great too. Try it!",

The music was incredibly loud obnoxious club type thumping garbage. When the waiter arrived whole my friend was in the restroom, I told him to bring what he thought we would enjoy, and he ordered for us. The food arrived via busboy in about 2 minutes and I said that it couldn't be ours because I had just ordered and he said that since they order thru an iPad the food comes out right away...but before we got our drinks? What arrived was raw squid, octopus, head-on uncleaned shrimp, three plates of beef, rice, salad and 10 accompanying side dishes. It looked good but was entirely too much food for 2 people, easily enough for 4 or more and I'm a big eater. We cooked and ate about half, but the food was flavorless and watching the  eyes pop off the shrimp as it cooked was less than appetizing. When waiter asked if we wanted more, I said that we were thru but would like to try the ice cream. The macarons were delicious. When the waiter arrived with the check he then told us we would be charged $5 EXTRA FOR EACH PLATE OF FOOD that we didn't completely finish. Why would they bring enough food to feed an army for two people? Ultimately didn't get charged the extra fees. Didn't really care for this place but it did seem like others were enjoying themselves. Just not for me I guess.",

    "text": "Intrigue and good company brought me in to Gen last night. The atmosphere is comfortable and trendy, the food selection is plentiful, and the staff members are very pleasant. However, the service is subpar, the quality of the food is nothing special, and the sanitary condition and cleanliness is questionable in parts of the restaurant that give pause to parts unseen. The confusion and disorganization however became a primary focus instead of enjoying the dining experience.   I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, but I don't live in Henderson. I needed a reason to travel this way - and my friend's invitation was the motivating force. I was excited as I love cultural food varieties and the concept of a cook-it yourself Korean BBQ peeked my interest.   Upon walking in to GEN, we were told our wait would be 30-minutes as they were quite busy. So, we headed over to the bar for our wait but became confused where to sit. It is an eating bar so grills are located between seats. I would have had no problem sitting down regardless of the grill plates, but the restaurant policy is obviously to presets the standard sides along the grill plates (e.g., spicy cucumbers, Korean potatoes salad, kimchi, meat dipping sauce & salt). I think having people stand around preset food is a little unsanitary. So, my stomach was slightly turning before ever sitting down to eat. Upon being seated, our assigned table also had preset seasonal sides at the table. This is truly a strange concept - I mean we are not talking about sealed condiments or salt & peppershakers. We are talking about open ramekins of food on tables in a busy restaurant with numerous people eating around these tables were preset food is placed. Not even the silverware in this restaurant is open to the elements - why the food?  We first ordered some Gen appetizers to give us time to look over the meat selection on the menu. The Crispy Squid Legs were tough to eat. The Gyoza was very good. The Pork Cutlet was good but arrived lukewarm. About 10-minutes after we received the three appetizers another server tried to bring us another set of appetizers not realizing we already received our order. But, the atmosphere of confusion doesn't end here.  Throughout the dinning experience we tried many selections of meat. We had the Gen Galbisal, Garlic Chicken, Gen Chadol, Pork Belly, Smoked Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Spicy Octopus, and Cajun Shrimp. There was really nothing that stood out as an amazing choice. Some of the meat had great flavor but most was bland that had to be dipped in the salt sauce provided. The garlic chicken came with a cheese like dip in a tin ramekin that had to be tossed on the grill plate so it could be made dippable.   Food runners would drop off ordered meat selections and run as abruptly as they arrived. At times, we were confused about what had been delivered - and searching for someone to answer this question after it was dropped off was futile. The answers tended to feel more like  guesses. Some answers were blantantly not correct with what appeared to be staff feeling compelled to give an answer - any answer. For example when asked what the side selections were, I was told my romaine salad was the seaweed salad :) I know what seaweed salad looks like - so really? When I asked what meat selection was dropped off - beef tongue or Gen Chadol, I was told it was Gen Chadol. It was a different quantity than was previously ordered and it didn't taste quit the same,  so I used the menu pictures for comparison. Yup, I ate my friends beef tongue thinking it was my Chadol.  The service staff appeared to be going in two directions at the same time - rather consistently. It was standard to wait long periods of time to have the grill plate replaced (or lit). Meanwhile, inhaling the burning smoke from food particles that fused to the stainless steal plate and produced a flowing, burning stream of smoke not caught by the under grill filtration system was uncomfortable. It really ruined the mediocre experience!   Cooking the meats on the grill was easier when oil was put on the grill plates because the plates are super hot and the meat instantly sticks. Some wait staff would bring oil when changing the plates and others would not. Often times by the time you realize THIS server didn't bring oil, and didn't ask if any was desired, he was off and running. If you were lucky enough to catch a waiter to ask for oil the wait was usually 5-10 minutes. Additionally, not one server could tell me what kind of oil they were using on the grill plates.   Lastly, there is a garbage and plate collection station outside of the restroom area. It is an unsightly, gross scene.  I can't stand to see dirty dish stations. That is something that should be in the back of a restaurant. I am not sure the flow of this restaurant was considered before the opening.  My Mango-Tini was really good! -  In the end, I won't be in a hurry to return.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Gen Kbbq for a date night (10.29.16). We are frequent kbbq go'ers; Tofu Hut, Hwaro, Korean Garden, etc. while we absolutely love Hwaro we decided to give Gen a try!   Initially going in, I'm impressed, the ambience is nice very modern and semi fancy and looks like a proper place for a date night. I'm excited before I even sit down! They were very busy but within about two minutes we got checked in by a nice girl she asked for my number and name and told me I'd be notified by text when the table is ready. We decided to walk around the mall and in about 20 minutes I got a text (when I was told 30) which I was happy about.   When we got seated we were immediately attended too. Our initial server, Ozzy, was kind and described the menu and banchan to us (by the way he described it you could tell a lot of first time KBBQ go'ers come in) he took our drink orders, appetizers, and initial meat orders.   MEATS: On the menu it says PREMIUM kbbq THEY ARE NOT LYING! The brisket was absolutely delicious!!! I love brisket from any BBQ spot but this wins the cake by far. We also ordered, spicy baby octopus, their premium steak, red wine/ smoked garlic pork belly, and beef bulging. We wanted to try more but we were too full. All the meats were marinated nicely and some came with onion and peppers (pleasant surprise) the meat is quality and I'd recommend any BBQ lovers to give it a shot! (Oil and salt available as well)  After our 1st round of meats we were waiting with a bare grill.. our initial server Ozzy was nowhere to be found... this was going to bring my rating down to a 3 or 4... until about 5 mins later EUGENE came and refilled our drinks and took our order, and our secondary server JUSTIN was extremely kind and helpful and in the most genuine way! (Not fake over over compensating)  Eugene and Justin turned our almost bad night into a great one constantly refilling our drinks, changing our charred grills consistently, checking back in, and bringing our meats out swiftly. 10/10 service by them!!   Overall, we had a great night, delicious BBQ and to top it off they had macarons that were exquisite as well (while I'm not an expert in pastries the green tea one was amazing). I would recommend Gen to new and veteran kbbq go'ers! TRY THE BRISKET AND PORK BELLY!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I understand they have only been open 4 days and are going to have some hiccups. That being said, I am also going to be very honest, as always, in my review.   We arrived a little after 8PM and checked in to wait for a seat. We were told 20 - 30 minute wait and they took my number to text me once our table was near ready. We were called to our table and all seemed to be going smoothly.   We were seated, ordered water and a sprite. We were given info about how the restaurant works and whatnot. Our server brought our drinks, followed moments later by someone else bringing another Sprite - lack of communication, not a big deal. I'd rather have 2 than none. They start you out with banchan waiting at the table. The Oi (cucumber) kim chee was good, I don't really care for the other sides, which seems a waste to start them at the table instead of letting people order them.   We ordered 4 meats. Spicy pork (one of my favorites), chicken, beef bulgogi, and the closest thing they had to kalbi. The meats were brought out - they put the beef bulgogi down and told me it was spicy pork (BIG difference both in taste and looks) - the beef bulgogi was actually non-spicy pork, the chicken was garlic chicken, and the other beef order was possibly correct. When I asked about the spicy pork, the server didn't really seem to know what I was talking about. He went and checked with the kitchen and then returned to get the correct meat out. We then later discovered that the beef bulgogi for my husband was the pork (which he doesn't eat). It took forever to have someone check on us so we could ask about the mix up. It was replaced fairly quickly, but the rice had already gotten cold waiting for the meats. I also ordered edemame, which never arrived.   We ate the food, which was rather bland. The spicy pork had some flavor due to the spicy, but the rest of the meats did not have the traditional korean flavors. The best tasting part of the meal was actually the Oi. Our server checked on us a total of one time, about 5 minutes after the food came out, to see if we wanted more food. They charge if you have leftovers on the plates, so we wanted to wait until we had actually had some food to eat. Good thing I don't eat that much anymore, because he NEVER came back! We ran out of meats, I never got the edemame (though we did randomly get a salad we didn't order?) and we ran out of drinks. After waiting for a LONG time, we realized we had been there nearly an hour and had been served ONE serving... seriously? We waited for the check. And waited. And waited.   I heard the table next to us call someone aside \"hey bro, who's our server, we'd like to order\". So, it wasn't just us being neglected. We waited a couple more minutes for the check, which never arrived. I got up and the husband followed. We walked toward the doors and were wished a good evening. Honestly, I was tempted to just leave, but I'm not that kind of person. We could have walked out without paying and no one would have known. Not a great business model.  We asked if we could pay, and the girls up front looked confused. I explained the situation and the manager was called over to speak with us. We explained it again, spoke with the manager for a few moments, paid our bill and left.   For nearly $50, I would rather go down to SURA for more flavor, better service (serve yourself from the food bar) and only a few dollars more per person. Honestly, I doubt we'll be back. I know the husband is not willing to go back at all. Hopefully they can use this as a training experience, but that still wont fix the lack of flavor.",

    "text": "Came here for a work dinner (yay! we made goal this month!)  Friday night and GEEZ it was packed! Expect a bit of a wait, but nothing horribly unreasonable. Probably took up around 30-minutes, during rush hour. You should get here earlier if you want to beat the crowd. They don't do reservations, so by the time we were seated, I was starving. It's $20 all-you-can-eat so it was a total steal compared to places like Sura, Honey Pig etc.  We had the smoked garlic pork belly, galbisal(?), beef tongue, and garlic calamari several times. I think I found religion. THIS must have been what heaven tasted like. The pork belly melted in my mouth. Although I felt like my party overcooked it a bit, our server (Terry I think his name was), helped us out. Most of my coworkers never had KBBQ before and when I wasn't paying attention, they seared it on their side of the grill for a little too long! It was perfect the second time around. Salty, well-seasoned enough to give you a heart attack. Glad our server paid attention heh. Coworkers were kinda hopeless haha. I mean, how hard is it to cook meat right?!  The kalbi was AMAZING. Thick, marbled meat that sizzled beautifully on the grill, it tasted fresh. My best friend (korean), is pretty critical of KBBQ joints and this, by far, blew her expectations out of the water! I can normally tell when she doesn't say anything and slightly nods and doesn't criticize the food. I was kind of shocked because she absolutely dislikes going out to eat korean foods that fall short of her expectations. Her number one complaint is usually freshness and Gen, she admitted, was pretty damn good. FINALLY, she and I can agree on something.  We had a couple waiters tend to us, but Terry stood out by doing a good job of refilling our drinks (I drink water like it's alcohol) and keeping an eye on my companions when they were stubbornly cooking the meats themselves.   Decor is very stylish and modern. Fits right in with Galleria. I like the open-air floor plan. Whatever ventilation system they have, it was way better than the other Gen I went to in Cali. My clothes didn't stink of pungent meats, which is a refreshing change. My friend complained a bit about that lol.  For the price, the quality is unparalleled. It's about $15 AYCE for lunch! Even better! I'll have to bring my other friends here next time!",

You're not going to get an amazing experience from the staff, they are more of just runners to bring you your uncooked meet. It will be the people you bring to eat with that will make the night amazing. Order all the different meats you want and they bring them to you. They crank up the grill at your table and you cook it your self. It's way fun and again... ALL YOU CAN EAT LOL",

    "text": "Decided to try this place because my boyfriend loves the location in Cali and we were excited that they opened one here in Henderson. To start off, the restaurant looked very clean and modern. There were plenty of seats and the vents did a great job at keeping the place smoke free and not smelling like a grill. Although it is a big restaurant, you would have to wait for a little bit since this place is plenty popular already.   At first, most of the staff members were very attentive. We were greeted once we entered and put on wait-list. Once we got to our seats, our server, Yuhao, did a great job at explaining how ordering food works, any drinks to start off with and what was or was not available for the day. Yuhao did a fantastic job at serving me and my friends. He constantly checked up on us and refilled our water.  The food served here is great. My favorite dishes were the brisket and KFC chicken. They have the best brisket ever! It was very nice to find a Korean BBQ place that served unlimited appetizers. A lot of their appetizers were good, especially the popcorn chicken. My friends and I also tried a lot of their meats that contained the \"thumbs up\" sign but found that a lot of them were not that great. The smoked garlic pork belly tasted like bacon and the red wine marinated pork belly tasted like Chinese sausage. I was very excited for the garlic chicken but was disappointed when it tasted like grilled chicken with nacho cheese. Besides those three, all of the other dishes were delicious and had a lot of flavor to them.   However, toward the middle of our meal, we noticed that our great service was dying. In the end, it seemed that our server was off the clock and new servers clocked in. This is where the customer service went from 10 to 0. None of the new servers ever bothered checking up on us. We wanted to order more food but it was almost impossible to get someone's attention even though my friends and I were constantly staring at any staff walking past our table. After two tries of trying to get someone's attention, I had to wave my hand and give the server the \"come here\" gesture for him to come to the table. My friend decided to order another appetizer but after waiting for over 15 minutes, he never got the food. We decided to just ask for the check and leave.   Overall, I would come back here because the restaurant has a lot of space and I love their appetizers and meat. $20 for unlimited appetizers and BBQ during dinner is a bargain. They just need improvement on continuing to take care of their customers after the servers switch shift.",

    "text": "I know this is a long one, but you're going to want to read it.  Okay, first problem: We were a party of 5 (for a birthday) on Saturday and came to the restaurant around 6:30 PM. We were told before we got there that the restaurant didn't accept reservations. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. We took a place in line (using their app) and shopped around the mall. After about an hour, there were still 20+ people in front of us. Instead of the 1-1.5, we were not seated until 9 PM! That is 2.5 hours, my friend! I want to kick myself for waiting that long for the crappy experience we had.  Okay, next issue. Our server asked if we wanted any drinks. We asked for waters with lemon, I asked for an alcoholic beverage. The server told me that she was underage and couldn't serve me alcohol, but she would have someone come ASAP. No one ever took my drink order the entire night, but preceded to give me their happy hour drink menu at 9:30 (when happy hour started). I left the menu on the edge of the table, but it obviously wasn't enough of a reminder (way to up-sell). I gave up at one point because I figured if they took that long to take the order, imagine how long it would take to have them serve it. We gave our orders (I ordered most of the \"recommended\" dishes.) which included a few sides of glass noodles and rice. The waters came with a plate of lemons because, according to the waitress \"the bartender was too lazy to put the lemons in glass\". WTF is wrong with your unprofessional staff? Why would you tell us that? And why is a bartender having to prepare WATER???? And isn't it ironic the bartender apparently makes the waters, but not the drink I was trying to order? Whatever, anyways, on to the next issue.   My boyfriend and I received our raw meat orders. We started grilling it up, but the 3 other guests did not receive their orders. When the waitress stopped to check on us, we pointed out that it is raw meat (therefore it shouldn't take that long) and it had not come out. She said that they were busy, and it shouldn't be that much longer. 15-20 minutes later, she came back and told us that the kitchen \"lost our order\". We ordered everything again, including glass noodles and rice.   The only plates I would recommend:  K.F.C. Tofu Glass Noodles  All of which were already prepared.   The raw meats were pure fat or tasteless and bland.  Not only that, the waitress was the only person that was slightly nice to us. The other servers were just tossing plates on our table and mumbled which dishes they were, then ran away as fast as they could. We had no idea what they had tossed on the table because we couldn't ask before they dipped out. Also, the person with the credit card machine (I really hope that wasn't the manager, because if so, this place has no hope) had a really bad attitude. The whole time we were there, we felt we had to ration our water (even tried to steal one of the pitchers for the table), the main dishes never came out with the sides (rice and noodles), and it was very difficult to get the servers to take our empty dishes. The shrimp and pork belly were the most unappetizing dishes. The shrimp had a funky taste and the pork belly was all fat.   Here's the cherry on top: I walked into the ladies room before the check came, and our server was curled up in a ball in front of the sink, next to a stall. Listen, if you're going to break down, please have an ounce of professionalism and cry in a stall where customers do not see you. Or, if you're sick, please call out. It isn't very appetizing to think you're getting sick, then serving my food.  If I owned this restaurant, I'd be pissed. The staff was extremely unprofessional, you need a complete overhaul. I'm shocked this place has the rating it does. I am so bothered by my experience, I'm going to tell everyone to never come to this restaurant and to go to Chinatown instead. I really don't care how cheap it is, I'd be happy to pay $30 for AYCE to never experience that again. Your unprofessional employees are going to make you lose customers and money. Good luck with that.",

    "text": "FINALLY.   I'm so happy that Gen made its way to Vegas because I go to the one in Tustin ALL THE TIME since I go to school in Irvine. For $20, you really can't complain. They have a fantastic selection of good quality meats, along with some other goodies like fries, fried chicken, etc.  I went with a group of friends the night after they opened and we were a party of 9. They ended up splitting us up into two booths, which was understandable since we were a large group, but we saw that there were tables on the bar side of the restaurant that looked like they could've seated us. We figured they must've been reserved or something, but it sucked that we couldn't sit together and it felt awkward screaming across the aisle to the group at the other table.   If you're used to more traditional KBBQ, you may not enjoy Gen. I'm Korean so I've had my fair share of KBBQ and Gen definitely keeps it simple. I was a little disappointed because they don't serve the steamed egg (gyeran jim) or the soybean soup (doenjang jigae) here. I also asked for rice paper, which I assumed they had since the Gens in CA have them, but the server told me that they don't serve that and he offered me tortilla wraps (?!)  in lieu of the rice paper. That was interesting. They were also sold out of a LOT of the appetizers when I went, but I guess that was understandable since they opened the day before.   Service was eh. It was difficult to flag down a server at times, but the meats came out fairly quickly. The servings of meat was pretty inconsistent though. We ordered the steak multiple times and a couple were paper thin while a couple were thick slabs. When we ordered chadol, the first plate was full, but the next plate we got literally had 8 pieces.   TL;DR: Good KBBQ place that was definitely much needed in Vegas. Don't expect traditional KBBQ here, but it'll definitely hit the spot!",

We were not told how to cook anything or what sauces were to be used.  Yes, I know we should \"know how\" to cook at Korean restaurants as its very simple ... Buy would have been nice to have waiter to explain how everything worked.  The service of the busboys is awesome. Music is that of a day club...Except day clubs don't play it as loud.  I would pass on this place if you have read this far.",

Possibly.   \"I had to ask for the check at least 3 times ... There is a coupon that offers $20 off of $40. This coupon is available online and says \"valid if printed\".  ... I waited another 30min, before the waiter came back with the hostess and said they were sorry, but they no longer accept this coupon. I asked to speak with a manager.  I told them that I had already spoken to a manager earlier and he had told me that this coupon was OK! But now, after waiting more than an hour for a table and an hour more just to pay, the bill was $20 more?!   Instead of allowing us to pay and leave with the understanding that in the future the printed coupon would not be accepted, the manager simply said it was out of his hands because it was a decision that corporate had made. BS  When I got home I couldn't find the original coupon, so I just gave up, came back, and paid for everything.\" 12AM, 4hrs later, livid  Spent more time waiting on the staff than I did enjoying my meal, and that's including the time it takes to cook it!",

For those that gave this place 4 stars or more, they should visit Hwaro on Spring Mountain to see the difference. I first visited Gen when they first opened in Henderson and I thought the food was mediocre, nothing worth driving out of the way for. Recently, I happened to be in the area and stopped by (after seeing 4 stars rating) to check it out again. Believe or not, the place and food actually got much worse. The meat quality was awful; the beef was so bland, looked old and dry, almost like the juice has left the meat. The place was kinda dirty and the hostesses were unfriendly. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the waitress Shea. She was the only good thing about this place. She greeted you with a smile and kept checking up customers regularly even if she got so many tables to cover. Good job Shea!!! Bad job Gen!!!",

This time, I actually give them a four star rating because of how impressed I was with our server Jaenica and how she took care of us. The reason why I gave such a low rating beforehand was because of how the service was and how the servers were completely confused and not communicating with one another.   The food was better this time. The portions of the appetizers now, especially the popcorn shrimp was a lot more than how it was before. The meats had more flavor this time and the service, even though it was busy, was much better.  I was fairly hesitant to come back to this place after hearing more negative comments about it. But I'm actually completely happy I went back because I'm definitely not down to drive too far again for some good Korean bbq.   Thanks Jaenica for the service! You were great to my family and I.",

As you order, they are not like the other places in Chinatown. They pump out the plates faster than we could grill and eat. The service is commendable. Julian was fantastic. He came by often with refills and placing more orders.   With a party of 8, it was easy to be sat. The huge area definitely makes for turning and burning.",

I loved that this place has a lot of different appetizers and sides to choose from but THEY CHANGED THEIR MENU!!! Their banchan is so pathetically small too. U can finish it in one bite and constantly have to ask for more sides. They should just give a bigger portion of banchan so they're not always running back and forth to get the sides on the table. I went thru about 5-6 plates of kimchi sides and 7 potato salads and it was just my BF and I.   Onto the meat- Ordered the brisket because that's my favorite to eat. Its ok. The galbi used to be good and tender as well but this time it was so chewy I couldn't even swallow it. Smoked garlic pork belly was good though.  A couple eating next to us ordered a meat that I wasn't sure what it was so I asked a waiter and he told me its roast beef. So I said okay I want to try it and when it came out it was totally different than the plate next to us but they just said its a \"different\" cut. Idk.  Overall, I am disappointed and will not be returning. I'll stick to eating $13.99 tofu hut because it's WAY better than gen and bang for your buck.   Side note: the table next to us ordered an iced sweetened green tea and when they recieved it , there was no ice and it was not sweet. Lol weird",

Their side dishes taste pretty good as well; although having come here just recently, it seemed like the portion of their side dishes has gotten smaller and smaller over time.

The ambiance is very nice although it is quite hectic inside because it is a go to place to most teenagers and get together. The service is great, but when it is very busy, service may take a little longer than usual. This could go from 3-7 minutes wait depending how busy.  This has been few times I have eaten at GEN Korean BBQ and I must say, the reason I was able to make this a 5 Star review is because of two fantastic servers. ALODIA and EDDIE are by far the best I have ever encountered with. Family or friends, they seem to always bring a nice vibe towards their customers. They are fast, patient server and well-informed in customer service. I would recommend them in a heartbeat. See for yourself :)",

She loves cooking her own food and ordering whatever she wants.  She always finishes with the Mango macaron!  I always ask for chili sauce, garlic and such to season my food with as it cooks.  Just ask. :)  The beef bugogi is the best, in our opinions, but I also love the chicken with garlic (comes with cheese sauce on the side.... just try it - trust me!)  The KFC is great and granddaughter adores the crispy rice rolls.   My favorite thing is the japchae - our waiter - who we always ask  for - brings it over to our  table as soon as he sees us!  lol!  Highly recommend...  ask to be seated at one of Terry's tables!   Oh.. did I mention it's AYCE?  Reasonable, too!",

Julian was an excellent server! Sometimes we get service staff that is too busy or distracted by multiple tables, but Julian made the experience like a normal restaurant with the right amount of follow up and didn't require us to wait long for making our next order.   Definitely give this place a try when your on this side of town.",

It just so happened when we got seated they did their usual happy hour chant, or so it seems. My Jameson was only $5 and Sapporo $4, not bad.   For those new to Gen, it is all you can eat (AYCE) and is $21 per person. It includes all the meats you expect and their sides too. The service was really good this night always checking up on us. As for quality, this was one of the best I've seen at a $20 AYCE place. Barely any fat at all on the brisket and they were not frozen either.   This is a great choice for dinner if you're looking for something off the strip :)",

    "text": "The king of Korean bbq's has finally come to Vegas, and it doesn't disappoint. Their menu has a large selection of 32 different types of meat, 29 if you're stopping by for lunch. My personal favorite on their menu was number 10, their premium marinated steak.  One thing this gen lacks though in comparison to the California locations is the infamous rice paper due to it being a Las Vegas health code violation. But I didn't complain, I never ate the rice paper anyways. What I was disappointed in it missing though was the rib fingers (meat between the ribs), and the daikon radish.  But despite that, gen still packs a punch in the gut, a good one that is! Their appetizer menu will keep you plenty satisfied in between main course orders and their selection is pretty large, unfortunately the seasoned fries, popcorn shrimp, and calamari are usually the first to go so I've yet to try myself. Wait times can take up to an hour, and the room occupancy is slightly smaller than their California counter parts, but still an hour wait beats the 120 min wait I've endured in the oc and rancho locations.. So be ready ahead of time.  Over all though, nothing beats a $20 all you can eat premium Korean bbq. Just be sure to clear out your schedule if you plan on going because you'll need it open for the food coma recovery!",

She's been our server twice and she very sweet, consistent, and most of all since the squid fried legs and shrimp popcorn are not on the menu for some reason she has that magic and we're still be able to order it. Keep it up Jess! See you soon. Lol   On the other hand shout out to MARISSA she's one of the receptionist to be honest and straight forward she's rude. I don't think she loves what she's doing. She probably need to quit her job! Came in today no line nor no people waiting. She greeted us, turn around, started chatting with other co worker, looking around somewhere after 10 mins she greeted us again and she paused for about good 2 mins before she told us that we can be seated. Is it that hard to accommodate a customer when they walked in? She could've said \"welcome to gens, I'll be right there with you\" or something. Ohh plus when we're about to pay why give so much attitude? Because we didn't add a tip on the card? Sorry but we prefer giving cash for tips. Well I'll still come back because of the food and good servers. Pls Marissa be nice with your customers. *rant ends*",

The only thing I have to complain about is the wait time but there's nothing they can do about that.  The best part is that it's $20 for AYCE which is awesome. I hope it stays this way bc I will come back like every week. I hope it's not a thing where they get a lot of people and then raise their price. They should open another on the southwest side of town lol  I definitely recommend this to everyone who has doubts about it bc it's honestly the best in town and I go eat KBBQ a lot. Awesome food at awesome price.",

The wait for 2 people to get seated was about 15 minutes and we received a text message when our table was ready.   We were seated at one of the high top communal tables. If we were there with a group it would have been fine, but as a couple seated next to another couple it felt awkward and tight. The music was pretty loud as well.   Our server was ok to begin with, but as our meal went on it got harder to get a hold of him. When we did get a hold of him, he seemed a bit befuddled. It also took a while to get orders delivered to the table. I've never been to a Korean BBQ joint where we had nothing on the grill for longer than 5 min. tops. Here we waited about 15-20 min.   The plain brisket, pork, and roast beef were good, however I would advise against the marinated meats. The macaron ice cream was tasty and the perfect size. The price for dinner was comparable to other places around town, but there's really nothing that made us want to come back.",

They have only open for 8 days and it's packed, came here for lunch @12 ish and had to wait for half an hr. Wkend is $19.99. They let u order 4 item at a time and everything on the appetizer. They didn't have Cajun fries and Popcorn chicken, which I didn't care for anyway. The KFC chicken was crunchy and tasty.   They have galbi(short ribs-boneless)... So delish.. MUST order!!! I'm not a fan of pork belly but the #17 smoke garlic belly caught me by surprise.. Not over powering with the smoke flavor.. Really good  All the side dishes were on par. I don't know how many times my niece and I order the side dishes, japchae was alright and I didn't like the fried rice cake(weird texture) skip it!!

Compared to the socal locations I've gone to in Irvine and Chino, it was just bad. The dipping sauce was so bland, the marinated kalbi wasn't good, the side dishes weren't good at all (ie: overcooked japchae and weird seasoning), and my plate was dusty. Also the main thing for me was that there's no bean paste stew... at a kbbq... wuut!! (Okay if you're not Korean I guess it doesn't matter much?) I also don't think they had steamed egg either but double check. Anyway I dont recommend this place to anyone.. better off finding a place in chinatown!",

It's a little intimidating when you never actually cooked on a Korean Table grill for yourself, but once you get the hang of it it was great. Our server Raymond was very attentive and Swift was bringing out the dishes and clearing the empties. The Decor is beautiful and The lighting focused on your table. We tried several dishes but my wife and I's favorite was the number 10 which is a delicious food and sliced beef to cook something a minute or two. The all you can eat style I want you to try many different dishes without filling up on one. We tried the Cajun shrimp only to discover that the heads were left on not something Americans are used to.   Dinner all you can eat is $19.95 it's well worth it.

You cook the bbq yourself but they should really consider switching out or using a different grill top for certain meats since certain ones just burn and stick which seems like a waste. The chadol kept sticking and got ruined but meats that are marinated cooked well and was delicious. Some of their side dishes were pretty good and during busy times it can be hard to get good service. Overall food is good and service can be good depending on what time you get in.",

Our servers are always looking for ways to enhance our experience. I wanted to give special shout outs to Blake and Shea (her name tag says \"Butters\") for their awesome work and personalities. Blake has served us many times prior to tonight, and every time he comes with a huge smile and a an urgency to his customers. Always looking to refill a drink or bring us more food. Interacts with his customers well. Overall awesome service! Tonight was my first time meeting Shea. My girlfriend saw another table who had cheese sauce and of all the times we've eaten here, we had no idea they had cheese sauce (which she is a sucker for). So Shea walked by and we asked her to bring us cheese and she tried to get some for us but I guess they only serve the cheese sauce if you order the Garlic Chicken. We asked her to bring us as little chicken as she could and she did her best and it was very much appreciated. She was very friendly, easy to talk to, both Blake and Shea deserve a shout out! Great team, great food, my girlfriend and I will always keep coming back!",

    "text": "Long overdue review for the restaurant and the server TERRY.  My friends and I are from out of town and were looking for any korean bbq AYCE places in Las Vegas. We came across Gen Korean bbq and we couldn't believe it was only $20 for AYCE because on the east coast, its always $30+.   The menu is very generous and you can choose a lot of different things from the menu. We always get the pork belly because we normally judge the restaurant based on the freshness of the pork belly and the beef. There were different choices for the pork belly and we tried every single one and it was all very delicious. I'm actually use to having lettuce for wraps (to wrap your meat around) for korean bbq so i'm not sure if that salad they give you cuts it...even though it was good as well.  I also wish they had more side dishes and gave you more kimchi initially. I'm assuming thats for costs reasons so they don't waste food so i KIND OF understand why they do that. But AUTHENTIC korean restaurants, gives you about 8 side dishes for your tatsting initially. Happy hour starts at 9:30 and we tried different flavors of soju. The yogurt soju was delicious even though, they water it down A LOT...which is kinda a turn off.   But honestly, the best part of the meal was our server, Terry. I have NEVER met a server that was so down to earth and friendly as Terry. He was SO attentive and quick on everything that me and my friends were very \"wow\" by his performance. We gave more than 25% tip because of his service and friendliness. We even went up to the manager and told him how excellent this server is and how he REALLY deserves a raise. We honestly came back two days after because of Terry and his service (and the food) :)   I highly suggest you request Terry as your server because you won't regret it.",

    "text": "I went by myself for lunch and a drink. Lunch was $14.99 and the soju, if I remember correctly, was $10.99. I ordered 6 different meat dishes, a plate of fried calamari, and a plate of tofu so I had quite a bit to eat. My waiter, Seong (maybe Sung?) took my order and came to check up on me several times throughout the meal. He came often enough so I never ran out of food, but not so often to the point that I would feel bothered. During my first round of ordering food, I only ordered one dish but he suggested that I order one more dish since the dishes aren't full sized. That was a definite plus since that allows customers to try a lot of different things, then go back and just keep ordering whatever is best on the menu to their taste (Remember that this is a buffet so you're getting a great deal here). In short the service was excellent. I would say the top pick goes to any of the pork belly dishes and also the spicy squid dish. Both need were cooked at the table, taste great, and the pork belly is just the right thickness and doesn't burn.  It's new, clean, and modern looking. Relative to food, service, price, and decor I think Las Vegas has found a new bidder for best Korean BBQ joint. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "My husband and I wanted to try this place because we love Korean BBQ's. They were busy so we had to wait a little. When we were seated, we ordered what we wanted to try and the server started our grill. After putting the meat on the grill, the burner in the grill goes off. In mid-cooking mode, we tell the server, he lights it and says \"don't cover up the whole grill because it needs air to flow.\" But it goes off again. He lights it again and props up the grill tilting it on a side and tells us to see if the air can flow better but if it goes off again, he will move us to another table. Sure enough, the grill goes off. We get his attention and he moves us to a booth. We are very patient people and we understand these things can happen but when the bus person who was moving our food asked my husband how everything was and my husband replied that we haven't eaten yet, he said \"I don't know what's going on,\" \"sorry for asking.\" Really??? Even if he didn't know what's going on, he could've said sorry for the inconvenience because obviously something was wrong if he was moving our food to another table?? But he says sorry for asking...... Customer service skills people! Don't know how the food tastes because we were disgusted with their customer service and their cleanliness. Both tables were not clean and I had to use my napkins. Very disappointed, we were hoping to enjoy Korean BBQ tonight.",

When it was time to sit us, they took it upon themselves to sit us on two tables. They didn't ask us and just assumed that it's ok for them to sit us on two separate tables. This was after waiting 50 minutes already.  We refused the 2 tables, which they didn't like when we did.  Another 45 minutes later, we are still waiting. One of the managers was rude (the chubby caucasian guy).  He said that \"you originally said 11\" which we did, but corrected ourselves within 10 minutes of signing in.  And what's that got to do with trying to sit us separately and making us wait longer than usual because of poor management and not training their employees correctly.  He was not apologetic at all, like it's our fault on why we are still waiting. Poor customer service. The food is probably good but I wouldn't know because we are still waiting!!!! Almost 2 hours now.",

    "text": "Our friend has been raving about this place since they came to town.  He came from LA and has eating it there many times.  So we finally trekked across town (40 minute drive) to give it a shot.  After we got there we knew there would be a wait but it was another hour! OMG this had better be good.  We were finally called and sat down.  The first part of there service seemed slow, we asked for water and a few things to start but it was our first time so we need some time for the rest.  By the time we ordered our next round our first round had not come yet...  All in all I think is was just a really busy night and the lull slowed them down a bit, pretty understanding of that.  When it did come it is small portions so it is good for the AYCE setting but please don't under estimate or they will charger you for not eating.  We paced ourselves, one if the things I really liked is the variety of meat they had.  I am a Bulgogi so give me that with one other thing and I am happy.  Here I tried so many things it made the experience fun for me again.  The different kinds of meat I tried was great, the service was great, some of the appetizers were good.  A few downfalls in my mind is they seved the lettuce chopped on the side (like a salad) I like to warp my BBQ in lettuce with all the toppings.  They were also missing the soybean sauce one of my favs but because they serve the lettuce chopped it wouldn't matter anyways.  They do have a Radish wrap our friend loves my man liked it I am not a fan but that is only because I don't like radish, so that has nothing to do with the restaurant.  The other wrap he loved was a rice paper wrap.  I tried it was amazingly difficult to work with and all my food fell out anyways (horrible), not a fan but whatever that is a personal choice.  I am still giving 4 starts because all the things I disliked besides the lettuce wrap and the soybean sauce was a personal choice.  The restaurant is Really good the meant is great and some of the specialty meat is absolutely amazing!  I like the small serving sizes because it is an AYCE they portion it on the small side so you can eat more kinds!    All in all, Great service, Good timing, could be a bit better expelling the menu if new even if our friend has been, food delivered quickly after the first lull, flavor of the meat and cuts of meat very good!  Could add non chopped lettuce, could add soybean sauce.   Pretty good stuff I might be back if on this side of town again!  If I lived on this side, well 100%",

However, time went by, servers did not walk next to us intentionally. I asked another server to get our server, he completely ignored us. We did not see our server for 30min. When he finally showed up, he looked upset and we felt very uncomfortable. Furthermore, they brought us the wrong order twice.   I talked about this service with other people who visited separately.  We concluded that the restaurant tried to slow down our order.   I am wring this review for other people not to come but to warn the owner or manager that if they keep doing business like this, they will eventually lose their loyal customers in the long term.   In the hospitality industry, we say that word of mouth spreads 10 times more than good word of mouth. If the owner want to keep his or her business for the long run, theyd better raise the price or fix the problem",

    "text": "OPENING DAY REVIEW  Moving from California, my husband and I are tough customers. You see, mostly every kbbq at California have similarities in menu options but the quality of the meat is what matters the most for us. That's why you wouldn't catch us in any 9.99 spot in California anymore since we've experienced a handful of premium quality meats in the 19.99 or 25.99 spots or even worse, per plate! Eeks now that's pricey but delicious!  We went at around 4pm. The crowd was a good crowd. Wasn't too hectic. We were seated within 10 minutes of waiting with a group of 7 (two kids included) which are 9.99 four years and up. Gratuity is included in groups of 6 or more FYI. We had to remind them of the salads and jap cha noodles since you can notice that with so many side dishes available, they can't keep track of whats supposed to be handed out without question. Haha. We weren't offended at all. We already know wassup. Being a waiter/waitress in hard enough, now imagine at an AYCE kbbq spot, that's almost suicide so  we have respect for them and try to be patient with no more than having to ask more than 2x of a 5-10 minute wait span.   Their noodles are really! I've tasted a good amount of glass noodles where it either had too much onions and carrots and everything mixed it to ones that were hella peppered up and all you taste was pepper to ones that were overly oiled and flavored up. This is a winner for me! Light on everything topping and flavor wise. Brisket meat was on point. Good cut and good enough fats on it. We tried their house steak but wasn't my favorite. The gen at California had thicker cuts with better texture on each bite. We used to just ask for pepper and salt to season it before throwing it on the grill. The beef tongue was one of the best yet, I'm speaking for my husband at this point coz I don't eat beef tongue at all but he kept going and going and going on it. He asked for lemon on the side so he was really happy with that. The Cajun chicken was devoured by my mom. She expressed how much she liked the seasoning as well. The pork belly was delicious. The wine pork belly is good if you're into wine marinated meats. You will taste the wine I can promise you that. The Cajun shrimp was good. You don't get that ocean taste. The calamari was alright and squid was alright. We really missed the Hawaiian steak that the Gens offer at California. That was honestly one of my favorites dish selection over there. Salad was on point! I don't know about you but I am a salad girl. The dressing was perfect. The slices were perfect. I went on and on with that. I literally had more than 10 plates of their salad alone. Perfect spice. Their brisket sauce is good too. Not too strong and not too light. They will change you grill no matter how many times you ask! Also you're not stuck with one waiter/waitress. Don't be shy to just ask anyone. They're all friendly and ready to serve you.  3 disappointing facts .. NO RICE PAPER, NO EGG POT and NO TOFU/BEAN SOUP! I've talked to the manager about it and he said they will not get any rice paper, they will not get egg pot since they didn't offer that in Cali and I stated that the Gen in California, Cerritos was starting it since I was there before we left for Vegas. They will not get tofu or bean soup since they offer miso soup and honestly their miso soup is too strong and too salty and very plain. No green onions on it nor does it have an tofu in it at all. It's more like a a tofu soup pack that you just microwave at home -__-   Overall, we're going back for the price and quality of their meats and side dishes. But very sad and upset that there's no rice paper and no tofu soup at least. The manager said he'll pass on my request and suggestions but I don't see it going that far unless we all team up and complain but then again, they're already winning with the price and quality they offer so I'm pretty sure people wouldn't give a damn in the end of rice paper or soup coz it's all about the meats anyway right?!   THANK YOU FOR OPENING UP GEN KBBQ! You've given me a little piece of \"home\" leaving California to live here :)",

I can't really say what to eat or what not to eat because EVERYTHING I tried was outstanding!!! The wait time wasn't that bad - be patient, it's worth it. I especially enjoyed the price of the AYCE venue. I'm shocked to see this place rated as 2 $'s because compared to other Korean BBQs in this city, this far exceeds expectations for price. I think it's hilarious when people rate these types of restaurants low because of the quality of the food...especially when the customers control how to cook their food. Only recommendation would be to expand the restaurant to accommodate more customers. Saving the best for last...this city is filled with rude and unpleasant-to-talk-to-type of people. It was refreshing to have a waitress (Jessica) as friendly as we had tonight. She is very attentive and caring...I just wish more people/workers would be the same way in this city. Thanks for an outstanding experience; I will recommend this place to friends and co-workers....and I recommend this place to all yelp-ers.",

Our first round of food was great and on time, then things went downhill from there. The kitchen ran out of rice server said it would be 20 minutes and we never got it while we were there. We never got our spicy calamari it was given to the wrong table. We ordered 4 more plates of steak since we thought it would come quick. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for our food. Our server finally came and she didn't know we never got our food, she sincerely apologized however the damage was done and we were very pissed off at this point. It was a shame this happened this was a nice place but after we seen some of the staff get off of work, order their food and receive it quickly without any problems we were soo done with this place.  We had to ask for our check from another server or manager since our server never came back to check on us. We got our check and the guy didn't even ask if everything was ok,  because clearly he knew we were upset. I would never come back and will not recommend this place. How do you run out of rice in an establishment like this is beyond me.",

Service is what really dropped my rating to a 3 star due to:   The service really lacked took 20 mins just for a drink and wasn't really that busy at considering they have 2 servers per area it seems like.  Hostess was talking way to soft way to soft could t hear her over the crowds of people or music that's with leaning in really close.   It really just seemed like there was a lack of leadership on the FOH.",

So my friend went to their opening week where they offered the free dinner voucher. My friend being the total noob that he was dropped his voucher in between the cracks of the seat and the wall. While looking for the voucher in between the cracks, he also dropped my iphone in there as well :/ What happened next was just pure history textbook. 4-5 of the servers did everything they could to salvage my phone using utensils, sticks, utensils taped to sticks, etc etc. They probably spent 30 minutes digging around in the tiny cracks, as if they were digging trenches on D Day to save their lives. In the end, the assistant manager Bryan (with a y) was the hero, but I definitely want to give a shout-out to all those brave souls who risked themselves to come onto the front lines and gave it a shot! So I would just like to take this opportunity to salute the fine men and women serving this fine establishment. Without the courageous men and women of Gen, I would never have gotten my iphone back! And for that I salute you, especially you Bryan with a y. 20 stars.",

He forgot our order multiple times, and never told us that something we ordered wasn't on the menu anymore. When I asked a girl working there for my water, she acted super confused. It took them 15 minutes to get our check. I asked the server for it multiple times, and he said \"I'll ask for it\". Why did my server have to ask for our check? Also, my server asked my sister how old she was for no reason. We didn't buy alcohol and she was very embarrassed. The door was full of people and the hostess ignored them. This place needs help. Do not recommend and was embarrassed I brought my sister here on her trip to Vegas.",

After being seated, we ordered the dishes and the food came out pretty fast. We soon ran out of side dishes and the dipping sauce. Our server was no where to be found. After about 10 minutes of looking around, someone came to change our grill and I asked for assistance. The person said he would inform our server. After about another 5 minutes, a different server helped, but he came back with half of what I asked for. By then I'm over this experience. I didn't even wait for the check. We went to the front and paid. I complained about the service to the front and the girl shrugged it off and asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and I asked what would be done and she said she didn't know with a giggle. I wish I didn't tip, but being from the service industry, I couldn't get myself to do that. I am highly disappointed. I only saw my server one time throughout the whole meal. I didn't enjoy dinner because I didn't have what I wanted to compliment my dishes. Plus, we didn't even get everything we ordered. Horrible. This is my first review ever. I was so upset, I had to share.",

While it seemed that she was the only server on the shift and a handful of tables she managed to make sure that we were all taken care of.

    "text": "With all the talk about Korean BBQ lately, this place what somewhat of an overpriced  let down. There were a few good things about this place. We were seated very quickly, and when our food order was taken, we got our meat quickly. The restraint in general was pretty cool. It was semi \"family style\" seating and semi private seating. There was also a large tv projection on the wall. However, the food was mediocre. Because we are cooking the food ourselves, I expected the food to be better spiced. In my opinion the only thing that wasn't bland was the edamame, which the customer doesn't cook. The cheese sauce from the garlic chicken tasted like Velveeta cheese. The service also sucked. We had to ask our grill to be changed out, ask for refills and they didn't ask if I wanted change for my bill until we asked them about it.  All in all, the quick service at the beginning of the night and the \"ambiance\" of the restaurant is the only thing giving them stars.",

    "text": "I had two sub par experiences at Gen BBQ. The first time I went into Gen BBQ I asked if they had any a la carte options since I am vegetarian. The hostess (I believe the lead) said \"we only do all you can eat\". I asked if I could just order a few things off the menu and she said no and was not very understanding about it. I was disappointed because my boyfriend really wanted to go. The second time, I decided to get the regular all you can eat menu and just eat vegetables, I asked if we could sit at the bar (so my boyfriend and I could have different grills). Again, without listening to the fact that I am vegetarian, she said no because no one was serving at the bar. I said I did not want to order drinks, just food, and she said a server could not take my order over there. She was not compensating and I don't think she even listened to my question. My boyfriend and I sat at the same grill, and she failed to communicate to the server that I did not eat meat and every time my boyfriend ordered a meat portion the server would assume two orders and brought us TONS of meat. I ordered a bottle of sake, and the server did not serve it with a glass. Just the bottle itself. The food is bland and the dressings seem to not be helpful enough to sustain its flavor on the VERY hot grill. The atmosphere is nice and has a electric blue undertone which makes the vibe of the place comfortable. Unfortunately, the service was not good and the food was bland. Don't order too much food (or make sure the server doesn't bring out two of everything, in my case!) note: they will charge you for uneaten food. I will say, if you eat meat, and are okay with paying a hefty price for prices of average meat, this might be the place for you.",

I was honestly shocked at how bad some of the meat we were given was, a couple plates were about 75% fat and gristle, and the rest were much more fat than usual.  The supposedly premium dinner cuts were just as bad, if not worse, than the basic cuts.  Would not feed meat like this to my cats, let alone a human.  All of the beef dishes had a weird-bad taste to them that I couldn't tell if it was rotten or just poorly stored, and I was afraid I was going to be sick later (but I wasn't).  The crowd was quite low for a Saturday, big change from all the other times I've been here before.  This place is clear across town for me, and I would pass a lot of other kbbq places to go here, but no more.  Even if it were half as expensive it would still be too much to be given plates that look like the bits that I would throw in the garbage if I were cutting up a raw steak at home.",

    "text": "My family took me here last night for my birthday dinner, recommend by a friend. It was really awesome atmosphere and the food itself was great! The reason why we give this place 3 stars (less if it wasn't for the food being as good as it was) is because we felt our server didn't interact with us at all. She actually didn't do much at all, the runner, I'm guessing did. Although he didn't explain what anything was initially either he did answer all our questions each time we asked and took the effort to explain what the side dishes actually were and what the sauces for meat were etc. So besides taking our drink order and bringing the check I don't remember our server at all. She also made us feel like we were inconveniencing her. I'm not sure if it's because we had children with us or because she assumed we were not going to tip, but it made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience. I myself was a server for 10 years from Fine Dining to Commercialized places and so I know what it's like on the other side. Hopefully, she also knows she was only given a good tip because I know she has to tip the others out (Runner, Bussers, Bartenders and sometimes Hosts)and they were great and shouldn't be at fault for her actions.   It was our first time there and not only did we have no idea what we were doing, we had no idea what anything was and had to flag down people for items and answers. We also felt rushed trying to order and there wasn't even a wait. It would have been nice if she had just offered assistance or knowledge or even ask if we had questions. These are all basic necessities of being a server. At the end, the server did bring a birthday dessert which was really nice, but she just set it down and walked away. The gentleman host up front actually remembered and said Happy Birthday as we were paying. Overall we will be back for the food and atmosphere, most likely and at least we did end up figuring out the process and items of this cool experience so now we know which will make next time perhaps more enjoyable. Was just disappointed",

Atmosphere is consistent, but Vegas menu is different and appears catered more towards an American palate.   The (raw meat) portions are served smaller; let's call it a single person serving. No complaints about this approach (just a heads up). Quality of meat appears of \"better than average\" (for now, at least). Large selection of meats as well as a good selection of appetizers.   An \"A\" for effort on service, but they've plenty of room for improvement. Long periods of waiting for the next order, bringing the wrong things, and having to remind the server about the orders. Staff does not mind their P's & Q's, which isn't a deal breaker, but leaves a lasting impression when a tray of raw meat darts past your face without so much as an \"excuse me\".   Overall, I recommend Gen to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ. Not your standard creature comforts, but a good meal nonetheless.",

    "text": "Very enjoyable first experience! First time trying Korean BBQ. We were here on a Saturday at 12:00 pm and had no wait at all. Service was fantastic. Food was brought out very quickly and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and advice. Her name was Kalin. Be aware this is 90% meat menu. Not a lot of veggie options if that's your thing. All pork belly we tried was fantastic. Red Wine pork belly was my favorite. Beef was also very good and chicken was just ok for me. Did not like the shrimp just because it was too messy and too much work.  Felt like we got very good value for the price $20 ayce.",

It again did not disappoint!  First of all, our server Andre was the best!  After letting him know how much we appreciated his attentiveness, he let us know that he is not even a permanent server yet! How can this be? He was great! I hope that the next time we are there he has been promoted! The food, also, was excellent. We ordered the signature steak, beef bulgogi, pork jowls, pork bely, and garlic chicken. We couldn't decide which was our favorite, but knew it was not the pork jowls...tasted good but too chewy. Also, I still don't get the cheese with the garlic chicken...the chicken tastes great WITHOUT the cheese! Great experience, great food, great service!",

The wait was only 15 minutes.  We don't like the fact that they already put out the slim # of banchans on the table already.  And also, though our server was friendly, she had way too many tables to get our orders out in a timely manner.  There seems to be a miscommunication somewhere when she said she will get another green tea for me (after taking away my drink), and her returning 10 mins later to see how we are doing, when I requested for my green tea.  She mentioned that someone was suppose to bring it out.  I don't know, maybe because they are still new so they still have not figure out the waiting staff logistics just yet...but this place doesn't impress me much.  The meats were good quality, but the time it takes to put in the order is very poor.  Everything comes out in very small portion too.",

Their side are pretty good nothing crazy, but I do enjoy the mashed potatoes they serve. The server was really nice as well, super attentive.   The only issue was with their new macaroons in the case by the check in desk. When we first got there to put our names down, I was looking at them and noticed A HAIR ON THE MACAROONS! I told the girl at the desk & assumed she took care of it. We left and came back when our booth was ready, about 45 minutes later, and the hair was still there!!!! Don't eat the macaroons.",

Waters were forgotten til probably after then 2nd round of ordering, even after a reminder. BUT after waiter took our first order, WOW the meat came out fast ! .................... that didnt last long.. it took forever for the orders later LOL dang it !   grill - noticed the venting wasnt as good as it was the first time i went. first time, i was super surprised how well they worked for the grill-side venting system. quite the bit of smoke escaped this time around. another note, not sure if it should be a blame or its just a common thing that happens... the ring of fire under the grill has a metal cap on top of it that helps evenly distribute the flame/gas... tends to get hit when waiters/whoever changes the grill. we tried to fix it a few times but still had trouble. it wasnt until the manager saw us struggling and came to fix it that it was fixed... up till then, we just had to keep rotating the grill to have the high/low spots for things XD   side dishes were definitely lacking. we had like... 3? maybe 4 diff items? wao o.O was it always this low?   this time around, they had the rice paper o.O wonder what changed ... hopefully its within health district ruling @_@ still dont have my sliced daikon \"paper\" i like to wrap my meats with before eating.   meats were the same. my uncles fav were the #1 signature steak and #2 pork jowl. #3 brisket was a bit on the leaner side this time.   overall still a decent deal for $20. yeah kind of far but eh i dont eat kbbq that often anyway... so im ok with the drive Lol",

    "text": "Went on Sunday 11-8-15 with my friend Jamie P.  I don't know what I can add that the 500+ people before me have not said, other than they seem to have worked out the service issues that they had in the beginning.   I've only been to Korean bbq one other time at Shilla BBQ here in Vegas, and it closed down.  It was really gross and dirty so with that being my only experience to compare it to, this place was very good to me.   I got the AYCE menu and a coke and my total was $28.47 with tax and tip.  I didn't realize that dinner prices apply all day on Saturday and Sunday.   ___________\\\\\\\\Things I liked:////  -The waitress did not get judge-y when we ordered a ton of stuff.  -The meat was super fresh.  -The salad was really tasty.  -Their rice was really good and sticky.  -Server was very attentive and brought refills and asked if we wanted more meat.  -Food came out really quickly. -Huge variety of meats.   -The decor is beautiful.   -The baby octopus are HUGE.  I was expecting the tiny ones like some chinese buffets have but these were like the size of my hand.   -Spicy rice cakes are wonderful.  I like them grilled.  ___________\\\\\\\\Things I didn't like://// -There was a huge spiderweb in the corner.  Didn't this place just open?  -The potato salad was gross.  Imagine cold mashed potatoes with pickles in it. Blech.   -We had to ask for rice.   -Banchan was sitting on all the tables prior to seating people.  I found that pretty gross.  What if flies landed on it, or worse, some kid comes by and sneezes on it??  Ewww.   -I asked for rice paper and was brought some chewed up sheets that wouldn't even stay together.  I think they were old or something.  -No macaron ice cream sandwiches like the other GEN locations.  BOO!!! -They were out of french fries and mac & cheese.  (like the only 2 things for kids)",

We haven't been back and have instead been going to Hwaro Korean BBQ in Chinatown.  They have rice paper, lots of sides, and the quality is better.  Hope Gen can get back to its glory days.

The wait isn't bad, even if there is a long wait on busy nights, the mall is literally right there.  They have the best tasting beef belly! They also have different flavors for their pork belly. I tried the volcano chicken and it was actually spicy so that was great.  I like their selection of sides including spicy rice cake, rice paper, gyoza, japchae, etc. I wish they have steamed egg though. Adonis and Ozzy were amazing they were both attentive.",

The food was excellent and of high quality, with quick service.  And you can't beat the value of the all you can eat dinner format.   Tables are a bit crowded (with food) but manageable with a party of four.  You just need to share cooking time.  Would be perfect for a party of two or three.   Definitely returning here!",

    "text": "I have never had Korean BBQ before, and for my first time I have to say it was really good. I went with my friend Rachel and a couple of her peeps. We arrived a little after 12:30 and waited just a few minutes while they prepared our table. I thought we were getting the lunch price, but they do not do lunch on the weekends. Still at $19.99 pp, that is not a bad deal.  Our server was nice, she did have a very thick accent so it made it kind of hard to understand her. She explained the menu to us, and how it works. Everything is AYCE, so you can order as much as you want. Most everything comes raw, and you cook on the grill in the middle of your table. This way you can cook to your liking. You are given a menu with a list of different meats, as well as appetizers. The items we tried:  Appetizers Gyoza- Really yummy. Little fried dumplings with dipping sauce, one of my favorites Edamame- It's edamame with salt, nothing good and nothing bad. Sesame Chicken- Fried and comes with sriracha mayo (I think) dipping sauce  KFC chicken- Korean Fried Chicken, tasty with a little bit of spice. Reminds me of General Chix Popcorn Shrimp- Not much to say bout this one. Came with the sriracha mayo that is yummy. We wanted cajun fries, but they were out.  Main Course Salad- Comes to your table with your dinner. Had a delicious ginger dressing on top. Veggies- Mixed veg, green pepper, green onion, and zucchini I think. Tasty when grilled. Spicy Rice Cake- OMG these are delicious.   Garlic Chicken- Comes with a side of jalapeno nacho cheese, wtf?? Not that garlicky. Beef Bulgogi- Yummmy.  Spicy Chicken- This is very spicy!  Spicy Baby Octopus- I wanted to be adventurous and try this out, but I didn't like it at all. it was spicy and chewy.  Brisket- This was my fav. Super thin and delicious. Rice- White rice to accompany our meal  We ordered a lot of food, and by the time we were done, everyone was super full. I would be careful in ordering because if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, like ours, you might give yourself a stomachache trying to finish. The thing is, you can't take anything home and they charge for uneaten meat. All in all, I have to say this was a fun experience. I told my boyfriend about it and he can't wait to go. It's safe to say we will be back.",

    "text": "I've consumed so much KBBQ in my lifetime so far it's actually rather scary. I've had Gen KBBQ at numerous of their locations both in SoCal and the one in Henderson, NV. The Henderson, Nevada location leaves a little bit to be desired over not only other KBBQ restaurants, but other Gen locations.   Their menu seems to be toned down here a little bit, and is rather Americanized. Growing up in Los Angeles, you have a lot of authentic choices in terms of cuts of meats and sides at KBBQ restaurants. Gen offers them, but they just taste...a little different. A little, less dramatic, should I say. And to my earlier point, is what causes me to highlight this location as being rather \"domesticated\". Which is a shame.  If you come to this location, be prepared for a wait, much as you would at any of their other locations.   The staff here is all VERY polite and friendly, and service is usually rather expeditious, which is the only plus side to this being \"Americanized\". If you've been to Korean run KBBQ restaurants that are authentic, you know good service is the last think you should expect.  All in all, good restaurant for KBBQ.   Would I come back here again? Yup.  Would I recommend this place to others? Sure, as long as they aren't expecting something too authentic.",

The grills suck the smoke through the sides, so you don't get so much in your clothes.   Another plus for me is their appetizers. I love the deep fried squid legs and the KFC (Korean fried chicken). The place gets really busy, so don't be afraid to place a large order at the start, since more than likely you'll only get checked on a few times. If I go in a group of 5, I'll start out with an order of 5 or 6 of everything (brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, etc.), then add on more later as needed. In terms of dessert, they offer those macaron ice cream sandwiches.   All in all, not a bad deal, just try to be prepared for your order.",

The location was difficult to find because they are connected to the mall. So your GPS might say go inside the mall it's actually not. It's near red robin and chevy's.  The time we arrived it was about lunch. They weren't as busy so we were seated right away. Once you are seated all the side dishes is ready and their service 5 star. They took our order pretty fast. The downside was that we didn't get our appetizer first the main meats and dishes came out before the appetizer which was okay had food in front of us to munch on. The food was excellent. We didn't care so much for their premium steak so I wouldn't advise to get that even if you are a steak lover, it was really bland. I would recommend to order from all the \"thumbs\" up listed on the menu. Their price is different on the weekend so on the weekend their lunch price is dinner price and the 14.99 is only valid on the weekdays. Overall, I would come visit this place again, their service is excellent as well as their food and the cool part is that once you pay you actually get your card back because they come to you to slide your card.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ, and this place is definitely in my top 2 list as far as Las Vegas goes.   We were seated within 10 minutes, which is unusual for a Korean BBQ place since it usually takes much longer. After being seated, we were informed of all of the menu items we were able to order. The menu, especially for the price, is a lot more that what we were expecting, ranging from beef briskets to marinated squid. All of this, of course, is all you can eat (AYCE).  After going through 5 orders, I already knew that this place was going to be a favorite of mine. The meats were delicious, and unlike some of the KBBQ places I've been too, the quality seemed excellent as well. The portions that were brought out at one time did not seem as large as other places, but since it is AYCE, this problem is alleviated. The servers were very attentive and came to us frequently, and waiting for the next batch didn't take an eternity. The appetizers and side dishes are very much appreciated and delicious, and I feel that the atmosphere was excellent.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience, and if it was not so much farther than any of the other KBBQ places from my house, I would come here much more often!",

We went on a Saturday night around 8, and the hostess told us the wait is about 1.5 hours. I said that's fine and wanted to put my name down. The she proceeded to \"warn\" me that their last call is at 11pm and if we are not seated by then, we can't order and that's completely my responsibility. I was very confused and said \"... but that's 3 hours from now and you quoted me 1.5 hours for the wait...\" She was like \"I know, but I just need to let you know that.\" I'm sure there's another more inviting way to tell me the same information.  Our wait ended up being ~45 min to an hour. I'm not sure if the food is worth that long of a wait (while I am fine with waiting for 2+ hours for KHDB) and the interaction with the hostess was definitely a big turn off. Probably won't be back anytime soon.",

Service and atmosphere are all a step above other Korean BBQ places. The price of $20 for dinner is much better than other places especially considering the quality of food. The reason for the one star rating......I witnessed an employee leaving the bathroom stall doing #2 (not the urinal) and not washing his hands. Not sure if I'll be able to eat there again it's a shame because they are clearly the best overall kbbq place in Vegas, and they allow single diners.",

    "text": "Would we want to go back..... Hmmmm NO! for sure NO! It was Tuesday at 6PM and the place was busy but not packed, there were free ready tables available, yet we had to wait - why? After waiting for few minutes we were walked to the table. Side dishes already on table - makes you wonder for how long these were there for. The side dishes selection, size and taste had a lot to desire. The place has high ceiling there's loud music and we had hard time to hear the waiter who was standing right next to us. We ordered their favorite meal #5 and #10. The waitress brought the meat to our table but started to serve it to a couple sitting next to us. The burner was not on. We called waiter to turn it on, he did. then you need to wait to have the burner plate to heat up - it never did. After about additional 5 minutes of waiting - the burner was still or again not working. We called the same waiter. He turned it on again. That was well over 15 minutes after we walked in with raw meat on the table and still cold burner. The burner was yet again not working. We called the waiter - again - he called manager. Do you know that manager has magic touch? Yeah he does and the burner was up and hot. In the meantime -since we were starving we ordered appetizers that is supposed to be ready to eat. The 1st round of the meat was already done and appetizer nowhere to seen. When we finished the #5 and #10 appetizer arrived. Taste wise - not much so far. Let's order some pork. Pork belly arrived - after we called waiter. Hey look the burner is off again. Called that guy and he turned it on. Got that pork going - at the end it was so greasy that most fat bacon has nothing on it. My wife refuse to swallow it. Then she ordered something that should fix the bad taste and improve bad experience. So how about chicken. Chicken arrived - hey look the burner is off again. OK that's it! Enough it enough. We call them to take that raw chicken away - paid the bill and left. Nobody came to talk to us to apologize or trying to remedy the bad experience. Price for the entire dinner was in upper range, taste was not much and waiters - we just could not hear what they are saying. Even if this place is just one of few in town we would not come back. Thank you but NO thank you",

From what I heard, the portions are smaller here in Vegas but it's AYCE, just keep ordering.   Just driving up to Gen I knew the wait was a little long and surely it was. definitely worth the wait. (Waited 1hr 30min on a busy night but didn't mind because we walked around the mall) Waiting area was pretty small but The texting feature they have was awesome. Better than waiting outside, not hearing your name get called & losing your spot in line.  Glad this location is far from the other KBBQ spots because if they opened up in Chinatown, they'd put the other KBBQ spots to shame. Ha. Service was great && Pork belly . beef tongue. On point!

Great price for a good amount of choices. Alodia was our server and she was super cool! She's funny and very chill! She was good with checking up on us and making sure our dinner was everything we wanted it to be. The only downside was that I felt like there was no privacy where we sat because there was another group right next to us at the high top tables. That was the only awkward part, so if you're in a group of two, I would recommend asking for a booth. Other than that, everything was great! And Alodia, if you're reading this, I'd like my pork silver please. Haha, thank you for your service!",

The first time I had it in SoCal it felt like a 12 gauge shotty. Korean BBQ could be this good AND affordable? I literally have spoken about it as if it was a religion to my friends. All hail $19.99 Korean BBQ ($14.99 for lunch) with an extensive menu and and quality cuts.  The interior is the most \"upscale\" Gen I've been to with its blue neon lights and the layout is efficient and spacious enough for any size parties. I believe there is 36 types of meat on the menu, you can order up to 4 items and all you can eat appetizers. Service may be a bit too attentive, last visit I had servers and managers table touching back to back within minutes of each other, but is too much service really a fault? Table with banchans were all set up before I sat down, doesn't sound like a bad thing to me!  What separates this Gen from the other's in California are the only cons. First there is NO rice paper. I love rice paper, and I know others do as well, but I was informed its not possible to carry because of Nevada law requiring it to be refrigerated and that causing it to not be appetizing to eat. They have tortillas as a substitute but its not a solution, definitely don't expect to be making Kogi's or Komex table side. There are a few missing items, notably steam egg and some other favorites. Call me crazy but I feel like some meats are thicker than they should be (brisket).   Besides all of the above Gen Henderson still reigns supreme in the Las Vegas Area (even if its in Hendertucky).

There will probably almost always be a wait time, but the great thing this place offers is that they'll send you a text when your table is ready. I found it pretty convenient since you can kill time in the mall while you wait.  This place is HUGE! The biggest Korean barbecue place I've been to, which can also be why service wasn't up to par. We were seated at the high tables - something I've never experienced before. I'm not sure if they're still working out kinks with their burners, but our burner went out at least 4-5 times. It wouldn't be much of a problem if service wasn't so slow.   Now their appetizer menu is pretty darn impressive compared to other places. They also have a unique menu for their meats. I wasn't impressed too much by the quality though. It lacked finesse and that special \"oomph\" that sets it apart. I personally found the environment and decor more satisfying to my eyes than the food to my stomach.  I guess you can say I probably won't be returning for a while.",

    "text": "Dining at Gen Korean BBQ was by complete accident today and was very hesitant at first since it was located in a mall as well as an all you can't eat place, but after caving into the love of my life...all I can say is wow, this place is awesome and the flavoring was perfect not to mention we had a great server named David from Hawaii. So make sure you ask for him, he was hustling and bustling and ensuring that we were happy as well as his other customers.   I'm definitely picky when it comes to food, so make sure you try this place out. My favorite dish was the Gen Beef Bulgogi (sweet one) and their side appetizers of different kimchi. The disappointment was that there were no short ribs with the bone, but if you like it without the bone then you've come to the right place. This was my first and definitely not last time to dine here.   Last note, it's hard to find this place if your looking at the galleria mall map. So the best way to get here is to go up the escalator to the second level next to Larsen's at the main entrance area before you enter into the mall.   Enjoy and eat up!!!",

If you are looking for traditional KBBQ restaurant, this is not your place.   The food was a huge dissapointment. The marinades lacked traditional flavor and meats did not seem to be of good quality. The combinations of side dishes were weak to say the least, as we were only given 5. They were even out of half of the sides of we asked for, unfortunately.   I understand wanting to cut down on wasteful eaters, but portions were miniature compared to traditional KBBQ places (example: they served my party of 4, 4 slices of galbi per each order... SLICES). However, if you are choosing to eat here I would not venture very far into their meat section...for example chicken with cheese sauce--absolutely bad.",

Granted we had a party of six people and they were busy but they did start to slow down and yet we still were receiving poor service and when we went to pay we found that there was a 20% gratuity for our table!  My friend was treating that evening and he did not want to argue about the bill so we let it slide.  This evening my husband and I went and walked in before midnight which it states is their time of closing.  They informed us that their kitchen closed at eleven!!!  I was upset and we left. They need to post that they stop seating at eleven in their website.  However as we got in our car the time on the dashboard said eleven which means we were there before eleven pm.  Then I also remember that when we were there with the party of six previously that we still ordered food after eleven pm!  This place needs to get their act together.",

To begin, Our server, Luke (AKA Luke Skywalker) was, what I could only describe as, a boss. He gave us fantastic recommendations, was knowledgeable of the menu options, as well as providing superior service that we could not find in most restaurants. The food could not have been better; we had the #10 steak (I'm not sure exactly what it is called), but it was absolutely delicious. The chicken and spicy pork bulgogi were all fantastic choices. Affordable prices, great for a date night, and a huge selection of foods for all-you-can-eat. I must say, I have not been this blown away by a restaurants service and quality in a long time. I would highly recommend Gen Korean BBQ House.",

My favorite is the beef tongue, short plate, chadol, kalbi, bulgogi, and the spicy BBQ pork. Their banchan (little side dishes) is also delicious!  My least favorite part about this place is the long wait. Be prepared to wait.......sometimes an hour or more before you get seated on the weekends. Other than that, this place is one of my favorite AYCE Korean restaurants.",

But anyway, like the other party of 6 we were seated at that back table. The grill was hardly warm. It would have taken several hours to cook a reasonable amount of food for 6 people. Management was downright cruel- not just rude. The meat was sitting on the table becoming a health hazard along with the food on the barely warm grill. Compared to a proper grill given at every other Korean BBQ establishments that we have ever been to (many)- this grill was a joke and one might question if they do this on purpose since this is \"all you can eat.\" There are many other much better places for Korean BBQ. Do your homework! :) Sort by low reviews!! You will read the truth!",

If you enjoy waiting, only to be ignored, then treated rudely, to pay out the ear, to get sick to your stomach, by all means . . . . Next time? OH HELL NO!!!! We waited over an hour and a half to be seated and sat in the back. It's supposed to be all-you-can-eat, buuuuut, by the time they come to your table an hour has gone by and it takes 1 hour to cook the meat for ONE order. I believe that they purposely don't have very hot grills so people cannot order it that much meat. It's absolutely horrible, and three people in our household were sick after we ate there. Don't even bother complaining to management! I had to go through three staff and the assistant manager and then ultimately the person called \"manager\" who doesn't know how to manage anything in our opinion, including his crabby, patronizing, whiny, bad attitude. The food is so substandard, it makes hospital cafeteria food look gourmet. This restaurant is part of a CHAIN. The only authentic thing was the bad food hangover of loose bowels and queasiness.  Patrons beware. Gen bbq, I hope you get shut down by the health department. Your restaurant smells and you ought not to sit customers by the bathroom!!!!",

He was around constantly to wait on us and he brought everything out quickly. He explained each dish and it's name before he serving it so we knew what each meat was. I told him \"thanks for being very attentive and for checking in us\". He replied, \" of course, I got you.\"  That is service above and beyond what I expected.   Also Josh was always there when we we needed rice and other items. Excellent servers - these two.   Thanks JR for a great experience at Gen and thanks Josh for also providing top-notch service. Your service tonight will definitely erase the memory of the bad experience I had previously.   Lots of food. Great price!",

Check In: First of all when they send me a text when my table was ready but they say \"your table will be ready soon\" is NOT the same as my table IS READY. It's either ready or it's not. So I didn't think anything of it so when I did check in with the hostess she said they gave my table away and that one is being bused and we'd be seated. Two other parties got seated before we got seated. First turn off.   Service: Was fine...   Food: Not much flavor and the sides were pathetic. Also, we found excess cartilage in our calamari. It's not our job to check what goes out on the table. We wanted Gyoza but they were out of that. The only memorable food item was the sesame chicken and the beef tongue.   Would I eat here again? No, I am forever faithful to Tofu Hut!!!",

    "text": "Coming from LA, I'm a bit biased towards Korean BBQ since I've grown up eating Korean BBQ in Koreatown in LA. However, in Henderson, Gen contends to be a very comparable KBBQ venue for transplants from LA.  The lunch is $15 on weekdays and dinner (and weekends lunches) are $20. The premise is all you can eat (AYCE) meat, and most of the meat is decent quality. Some AYCE restaurants serve low quality meats so they can bring your a tremendous quantity, but Gen doesn't compromise quality. The beef brisket and tongue are very tender and juicy even if you have to cook it yourself and believe me, I've gotten way more plates of those order than I should. Their pork belly (samgyupsal) is worth trying although I'm only a moderate fan of that cut. Their soy sauce has a mild tart and sweet flavor which adds a unique flavor when you dip meat into it. You can ask for all sorts of side dishes included in the price such as japchae (glass noodles), calamari, tofu soup, etc.  I'm somewhat of a KBBQ veteran having eaten at many AYCE KBBQ places, and Gen is near the top in my overall list of KBBQ to visit again.  The parking is at the Galleria Mall. And if you have to wait for seating, which can happen during dinnertime, you can always wait while shopping at the mall.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive even when business gets busy.  They have you pay your check on an iPad which can be unsual for some folks, but they make the process very easy and low-pressure as they look away when you select a tip amount in front of them.",

There's usually a long wait for dinner but they have an app you can download which tells you how many people are in line ahead of you.   I really like the garlic chicken with fondue and the bulgolgi pork. I also tried the rice wine which was strong but did it's job lmao   CONS: Most (save maybe 2 or 3 people) of the staff seem snobby and unhelpful. Pretty much like college students that hate their job. I've been there before but I don't appreciate it when I am tipping you.   All in all, this place is great.",

    "text": "With all the surrounding hype and negative publicity regarding their reviews it was time for us to finally visit Gen. It has been almost 3 years since I last set foot in a KBBQ place since leaving California, there was always that hesitation that nothing could ever compare lol.  All that changed when I tried Gen for the first time last night. The food itself I would give 4 stars, more on that later. What really sold me on this place is the crews dedication and quality of service. TOP NOTCH. I have never seen a group of people work so good together, everyone was in sync. It wasn't like, this is your table/area you deal with it. They all pitched in as far as clearing your plates, asking if we needed anything else, can I replace your grill? And all with courteousness and smiles to boot. It was fine dining caliber of service for sure! Our waiter Ozzy was wonderfully pleasant and friendly, almost giddy lol like he truly enjoyed being there. I think that speaks volumes on how management runs this place. Though it was busy on a Wednesday night it wasn't chaotic.  For starters we ordered their crispy sesame chicken and pork cutlet, both moist and flavorful. The banchan offered were tasty though I wish there was more choices, I would've loved to see some bean sprouts and fish cakes. The meat selection was plentiful, too much choices if you ask me. We settled with the crowd favorites:   -Gen Yangyum Galbisal (marinated premium steak) only offered during dinner AYCE which is $19.99 by the way. Delicious marinade that you can really taste.   -Spicy Pork Bulgogi I'm a weak sauce and a sissy so I didn't enjoy this as much but hubby loved it. The beef bulgogi on the other hand was melt in your mouth goodness!  -Gen Chadol is my go to in every KBBQ place, it cooks very quickly and it's scrumptious wrapped in Rice paper (another HUGE plus for this place is they carry rice paper, brings back such great memories of home) and dipped in sesame oil and salt. Ahhhhh I'm craving this again!  -Smoked Garlic Samgyubsal (pork belly) is the least of my favorite, though it was good and tasted like bacon, the garlic flavorful was not prominent at all.  Of course we couldn't leave without trying their Macaron ice cream sandwich. It was tasty but not worth the $3.95 price tag in my opinion with its minuscule portion. Definitely looking forward to going back, it's a great place to eat and be merry with friends and family. Only bad thing is it's quite a trek for us to get there but maybe that's a good thing or else we'll find ourselves here a little more than our waistlines would like.",

These are just a few reasons why Gen Korean BBQ gets five stars:  -Friendly staff: If you don't know what something is, ask and surely they will tell you.  Also, they are happy to provide suggestions based on your likes and dislikes -Good quality meats.  No nasty cuts. -Fast service.  Some yakiniku spots have you waiting DAYS for raw meat.  Not here! -Efficient.  Once we were ready for our check, the host came around with an ipad, swiped our card and printed our receipt.  Painless! -Yummy Korean food.  Good dobbokki, especially in LV is hard to find.  They stay True to Korean specialties while making it accessible to everyone.  Even my in-laws who are kind of picky, LOVED this place.  My FIL kept asking \"what's the catch?!\" in disbelief!  Best part is that a new one just opened in Hawaii.  Once the hype dies down and the wait isn't three hours, I'll be there!",

It being Mother's Day we expected to wait long. Longer than the wait we had. Given it was Mother's Day we actually didn't wait long. I checked in at 4:30pm and was told it was going to be a 60-90min wait. They took my name and phone # and texted me when we were close. We were seated by 5:30pm and out the place by 6:45pm! Impressive!  The service was spectacular! From the start to the end and everything in between! It was a well oil machine, in my opinion. Ordering was easy as the server had iPads (or some electronic device) that they used to input our order as we spoke and the food was out to us in minutes. They had servers to take our orders, bus persons for drinks and \"runners\" as I call them serving our food. From one order to another, wait was minimal. We even had someone offer us a grill change in between! The meat was nice and fresh. Selections of meat was outstanding and to top it off they had appetizers that were included in the AYCE price of $19.95!   The place was more of a lounge feel. Dimmed lights and loud music. It was nice! I definitely think it's more for adults because of the feel but it was still a kid friendly restaurant. They had spacious booths and walkways. I personally won't take my kids with us here but if you had to, there's no harm as several families had babies to kids with them.   Another thing I loved was the place was not smokey! We didn't leave smelling like Korean bbq like we would at any other kbbq joint. They had the new grill that had the vents on them and smoke went directly in. It was awesome!  Will definitely be back for more date nights or girls night for sure!   Great job GEN!  Btw, out server was Justin and he was awesome!",

I came with my aunt and uncle who were visiting from California; they also had a friend from Taiwan with them. Even though we were only a party of four, we were seated at a table with two grills, which was nice. We came on a Monday night around 7PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Our waitress was rather nice and her shift ended during our meal, but our subsequent waiter was also quite attentive and friendly.   The menu at each Gen is slightly different, but I feel like there were less items on the menu than the ones in California. The quality of the meat was good, but also not as good as California. There were fewer banchan and no rice paper here, and you have to ask for the daikon radish sheets. Portions in general are smaller, but since it is AYCE, just ask for more.  Overall, a solid meal at a fair price, but not as good as the California locations. Also, it was a little bit warm in the restaurant during our meal; you would think they would turn up the A/C more given that it's summer in Vegas and there are a ton of barbecue grills running.",

    "text": "I usually eat at Gen on special occasions or when I have friends visiting from out of states. Every time before I entered, I looked at the menu displayed at the main entrance to see if Gen have the steaks that Gen serves during lunch time. I will see it displayed but when I am ordering with my family or friends the steak, even when the Restaurant just opened, the waitress will tell us , \"I am sorry we are out of the steak.\"  The problem is, the menu on the main entrance and the menu that they gave me and my family or friends did not say, \"out of stock on the steak.\" The waitress waited until you start ordering.  The other problem with Gen Restaurant about ordering steak, they always \"out of stock.\" One time, we ordered 3 different menus and guess what, the waitress told me with my family, we are \"out of stock.\" Imagine, 3 consecutive orders were \"out of stock.\" I was invited with my spouse back to Gen Restaurant by a friend. I told my friend that Gen Restaurant has this habit of \"out of stock\" on their menu. She told me that to give it another try and if it happens again, we will never go back to Gen Restaurant. Guess what? There was no steak again, as usual response,\"out of stock.\" For me, this is a pattern. Gen displays a \"False Advertisement \" to the public. I need to contact the agency that enforces the Consumers' Act because this is not the first time that this \"False Advertisement\" has happened. For the readers, I used to work in a restaurant and I know what the things the owners in the restaurant are not supposed to do. For the future customers, I wish you luck because by writing this article whether Gen Restaurant will take it constructively and have the menus always \"on stock\" or you will be the next VICTIM of \"out of stock.\" Lastly, for the new customers, be prepared to be embarrassed by Gen's waitress. Gen Restaurant is \"Eat All You Can\" but when you call the waitress to order, they tell you as a customer, \"You still have food on your plate.\" I am the customer. Why comment that \"You still have food on your plate.\" Then again, future customers, good luck and enjoy your unwanted menu on your table Gen Restaurant because \"out of stock.\"",

I liked that we had little sides waiting at the table for us. We arrived party of two and had to wait ten minutes for our table, even though was a lot of empty tables, but there must be a shift change or something or section rules, I don't know. Lots of employees though.   The dining was nice. Except when you ask for extra settings for my friends arriving. It's all good, we just got up and walked to a neatly set table and grabbed the extra settings so they can eat. The dining was good. The food was equal to the price.   Except when it comes to splitting checks. They can only split the check three times. We spent more time waiting for the check than eating. We got up and just paid up in front no problem. The lady who takes the money usually walks to each table with an armful of electronics. She looked like she was going into an intergalactic battle.   Food was great, service was awkward with how to pay.",

    "text": "I went last night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The ambiance is nice and quaint with nice decor. It is conveniently located next to the Galleria Mall, which prior to that, I was just at because I picked up a gift card because of a special promotion. I asked the front desk if this could be used at Gen KBBQ and she said yes.  When I got to Gen, I wanted to make sure so I asked the hostess before signing in if we could use these Galleria gift cards but she wasn't entirely sure. I handed both cards to her and  she asked her fellow hostess whether or not they'd work. They both said yes.  The food is alright, typical kbbq. Honestly, it kind of sucks that the meat portions are so small so that we have to keep on ordering back and forth. I would say that Gen has more focus on it's appetizers, but that's my opinion. Our server was somewhat tentative, I never got a refill at all until the very end...  We changed our grill plenty of times like at least 5-6 because of how charred it'd get. It sucks that they don't provide oil on the grill anymore like they used to.   When it was time to pay, I gave the same hostess that I had spoken to both the gift cards and she then told me that they actually don't accept them after running the cards and went to go speak to the manager about it.  Long story short, this review is more focused on the customer service. I ended up paying my debit card which I didn't mind but next time, don't provide me False information... especially if you had another hostess agree with you, when in fact, were both wrong.  Next time, if you don't know, ask the manager. I would've been more understanding.. but boy, was that a hassle. I'm not entirely sure if I'll come back.",

They should have put us in a larger table but oh well. Sides are nothing to talk about as they all are the norm in any Korean BBQ place. Nothing that really wowed me except for the macaroon ice cream. If they could beef up (pun intended) their sides it would make for a 5 star place. Ambiance is nice as well.",

The service is good, they bring the food quickly, and there's lots of it, but the marinade for the bulgogi just isn't quite right: it tastes like it's just soy sauce without any ginger or other seasonings.  The kimchi selection isn't what you'd get in a place in Chinatown, and I prefer a place where I go get my own selection from a line (Sura, five stars), instead of them bringing it to me (like at Mother's).  However, if you're in Henderson at the Galleria and you just HAVE to have Korean BBQ, stop here.",

    "text": "I went yesterday for the first time with my cousin and her boyfriend.  We figured all you can eat for $16 was a pretty good deal.  Once we sat down, we were told prices were higher for President's Day (about $5 more), but we're already there so no big.  My cousin and her boyfriend ordered calamari and brisket and got their food pretty quick.  I ordered crispy sesame chicken, but what I wasn't told was that there would be a wait (at least 10 minutes).  I had some salad and rice to munch on, but it was annoying to have to be the one to remind our waiter about my food.  He'd come by asking if we were ok, and I'd have to tell him \"just waiting on my chicken.\"   He would tell me it's frying, but he never said why it took so long.  I worked at a restaurant where we fried food, it would never take as long as this did.    When it finally arrived, it definitely didn't look like the picture, just 5-6 pieces of shrunken fried bits.  Half of them actually had chicken in it, the other half were just pieces of fried skin.  I ordered Cajun chicken next, which came out pretty quick, though it was hard to taste the Cajun flavoring.  Then our waiter forgot my cousin's final order for more brisket.  Most of the food (minus the chicken) was actually decent once it came out and was cooked, and the presentation inside is neat, almost has a club like atmosphere, high end.  But service brought this experience down. If our waiter seemed friendlier, it might have not been as bad, but he just seemed like he was running through the motions for basic service.  Plus, for those who have never been to a restaurant like this, you cook your own food.  There's a skillet/stove top in the middle of your table and you put your raw meat on there to cook.  Yes, it's unique, but you're paying them so you can cook your own food.  Sure they're providing the meat, but it might not be worth it to you.  In addition, you cannot leave any leftover meat or else they'll charge you and you have a two hour limit.  Now this is common with other All You Can Eat places (like sushi), but if you want to eat without restrictions on how much to eat and for how long, stick to somewhere else.  I wanted to try this place, but now that I have, I probably won't go back.",

The food was great, the staff was awesome UNTILL they got this new asian manager that goes to your table and pretends to clean up your empty plate but in reality she is seeing the portion of your food including rice. We use to get a decent size rice bowl then for some reason our rice started becoming half of the bowl when we order for more rice. This managers customer service is fake. Its sad that GEN was one of my favorite places to eat at and ill make sure to never come to this place again. I feel bad for the hard working staff that has to deal with her. If you hate your job, find a new one. Its not our fault that you had to manage this GEN!",

    "text": "Our last two out of three experiences have been terrible and inconsistent. Last time, we were not offered salad and the \"mushrooms and vegetables\" plate was a few button mushroom pieces and onion. Tonight, a salad was waiting for us on the table and the mushroom and veggie plate had a heap of shiitake mushrooms, red bell pepper, onion, and scallion. This is also the second time in a row I've ordered the iced green tea and it's essentially been green water. There is literally no flavor in their tea.  Tonight, pretty much everything went wrong and the service wasn't enough to make up for it. Our grill did not work. Our chadol had been on the grill for 10 minutes and was still pink. First, our server told us that they weren't allowed to turn up the grill. Then she had to go ask the \"head waiter\" for permission to turn up the grill. And then that person didn't know so they had to find a manager. After a few minutes of waiting, we were told they could not turn up the grill. When I pushed the issue, we were \"allowed\" to move to another table, which took more than 5 minutes to be cleared out. Moving was a messy process. We were told we only had to bring our drinks, but the salad, our dipping sauces, and our tongs did not make it to our table so we did without.   Once we got settled in the new table (minus some of our stuff) we got bowls of rice. My mom's had a long, black hair on top of the rice. Our server carried it away, joking that \"at least it wasn't hers.\" Thankfully, this table's grill actually worked and we were finally able to eat some food. Service really took a nosedive at this point. We never got refills on our drinks and our grill was pitch black and smoking badly before we finally got a change. We got KFC that was stone cold and hard. We asked for two more plates of bulgogi and only got one. At this point, we weren't full but we were tired of dealing with the crappy service and opted to get the check. With so many authentic KBBQ spots in Vegas, we're not coming back.",

Food was delicious but the sides and accoutrements were a generally watered-down, Americanized version of everything. The green tea is Lipton.  Our server was very nice but looked like he was walking around in a daze most of the time. Service was inconsistent. If we ordered 4 items, 2 came out. If we ordered more sides, nothing came out until we asked again. I overheard him messing up a split check at someone's table and then just sort of shrugging it off instead of fixing it.   But overall, it feels like a fun place for a family dinner or a cool date. They also have a decent happy hour and reverse happy hour starting at 8pm.",

I love the colored lights and they always play good music!   The food itself is absolutely delicious and they have a various of items on the menu. Whether if you want more meat or appetizers, there's always a handful to choose from! My personal favorite is their red wine pork belly and the KFC. They are definitely a must try!!   The service is spot on and the hostess immediately greets you when you walk in. For the waiters, they always check to make sure your table is satisfied. So far I never had any issues which makes my experience smooth sailing.",

If you know KBBQ, it never feels clean, which is understandable because of all the grills, so to feel like the environment is clean is pretty awesome.  The staff is ok, occasionally I have to flag someone down.  And because you're getting a few people at the same time you're not to sure who got the order.  There's are times I received nothing and other times I received three orders of the same thing.  So besides that hiccup it's actually a really great place to eat.  Obviously it has an American flare to it, but if you don't want to wait, get good food, and not walk out too smokey check it out.  It's definitely family friendly so all is welcome.",

I was pretty disappointed but it's just tea, I got over it (kinda lol)  Food comes out fast!! And they changed our grill when it got gross looking, which I greatly appreciate!!!!

There are a few more selections during dinner, but the lunch selection is pretty generous in comparison to most AYCE KBBQ places.  Meat quality is pretty good, and it's comparable to my favorite Gen location in California. My only gripe is the steak is not as good quality and cut pretty thin in comparison to what I'm used to.  Service: 0 - Is it possible to give a negative number?  Our hostess was bright, friendly, and welcoming. The servers were not. I've been to this particular location twice, and the service has always been lacking. Servers are often hard to get a hold of because they were either huddled together, talking, or they'd drop off a plate and run off before you could even get a word out. When they take your order, they look disgruntled, as if they were forced to be there and you had asked for something more unreasonable than a plate of meat from the menu.  I don't particularly need my servers to be super cheery because I realize working in the service industry can suck, but these servers need an attitude adjustment. I'm not sure what happened with this particular location, but all the ones that I've been to in Southern California have awesome servers.  Ambiance: 4  All Gen's look the same. This was is on the smaller side, but there's never really a wait. Lots of parking in the mall.",

Let's start off that our service was very attentive. Our server was friendly and quick to meeting our needs. We received our meat and side items immediately and we had our grill replaced about 3 times. Our highlight items are the kalbi ribs, pork belly, and prime beef. For $21.95 the prices are reasonable considering dessert isn't included. I wish the rice paper was included as well. I did notice that our plate were chipped. Not sure if that's something they seem to care about considering there was more than one chipped dish, which could be a potential hazard. Also, expect to cook, it's not like Hobak where the server cooks the meat for you.",

They have it all sirloin steak, beef and pork bulgogi, short ribs, various pork bellys, brisket, pork chops, chicken, shrimp, calamari, tongue, Korean fried chicken, octopus, intestine, and so on. Just check out their menu. They also have dessert and alcohol but they're extra. Everything is good here the food and the service.   The only knock on them is the music is cranked up way too loud.

One thing that I really like about Gen is the ambiance. I've been to quite a few Korean BBQ restaurants and I would say that Gen is #1 when it comes to ambiance and cleanliness of the establishment. The food are served in nice looking plates. The only thing that is stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the fact that sometimes, it is extremely hard to get a table and they do not take reservations. Another is the fact that they don't have fish cakes, which is OKAY because what they're missing with the fish cakes, they make up for in their large selection of appetizers. So all in all, this place is pretty great! I highly recommend it, especially during lunch! Great price and less crowded. :D",

I have worked in restaurants for couple years and I definitely know how hard a AYCE restaurant can survive in Las Vegas. I have been here over 5 times and have seen it's growth week after week. Some people compare this GEN to the GEN in LA. However, it is a whole different thing. The ingredients prices are much higher than in LA. With $20 bucks to eat lots of choices of meat and other side dishes, you can't get it anywhere in Las Vegas. This place was a little mess at the beginning before its grand opening. However, it's getting better and better now. Also, I really want to recommend the server Howard I was served twice by him and he definitely elevates my experience at GEN. Also, Julian as a food runner, delivered my food really fast. He is cute!",

Last night the salad and Japchae was already at the table. FOR ME THAT IS A NO, because it's not sanitary to me. I mean how long has that been sitting there? I'm fat, so I still eat the fish cake and kimchi. 3rd BATHROOM WASH TRASH! The floors were sticky and it was not properly clean. I understand they have the dinner rush, but please have someone delegated to clean the bathroom at least every hour to the hour. 4th service was great, Ozzy you were great! Always making sure we were good, and making sure we got our food right away. They even accommodated my weird request of just having a plate of lettuce no dressing .They were always asking to top off our drinks or to change our grill.  5th the real review on the food: meat was really good, I don't think you can really go wrong with the meat at Gen. If it sounds good, 8 out of 10 times it will taste good. THAT BEEF BELLY THOUGH! THAT IS A FREAKING MUST TRY!!! Chicken and cheese sauce is good as well. Red wine pork belly is so sinful. Sesame chicken my favorite. Only complaint is that they NEVER have Squid Bulgogi.   PS: Ozzy I was trying to get you and my tall man friend together.    Gen is a great place to eat, GOOOOOO!!!!!",

As for the food, it is more Americanized compared to other kbbq places but it's still good! My favorite would definitely be the beef bulgogi. Least favorite would be the pork steak (it was dry and it kind of had a weird taste to it). I also ordered the lychee soju cocktail since happy hour is 9:30 to closing every day. It's $11 instead of $15 for a 32 oz drink and it's so good!!!  AYCE dinner is only $20.99 which is cheaper than most kbbqs around Vegas and it includes appetizers as well!",

Luckily, there were four spots at the bar that we were able to nab, which still made for a fun experience.  We did the AYCE dinner experience and honestly, it's a great price for what you're getting. The bar was set up so that there was a grill between two people and we were still able to talk and enjoy each other. The noise level was a little high, but nothing that dampened our experience.   It's not even worth listing everything we tried because I'm pretty sure we tried about 60% of the menu. It was all very yummy and filling and I didn't think the meats were too salty or anything. Our waiter was great and accommodating and since we were at the bar, the bartender was great as well. Our grill was changed out once it got pretty dirty, we didn't even have to ask.   Summary: There are a lot of options on the menu / it's a large, great space / clean and great customer service / yum.  Next time: I want to try their desserts that they showcase in the front - was too full from dinner last time!",

This restaurant is located at the Galleria Mall. Service is inconsistent... there are good days and bad days but mostly good. Selections vary and the quality of the food is okay.   Theres some days when the flame of the grill can be low or hot. Whenever it's low, it takes a really long time for it to cook.   We always get the pork bulgogi, GEN premium steak, pork belly, beef tongue, and Red Wine steak. They also have appetizers like gyoza and the jap chae. Sides are unlimited, of course. Everything legit tastes better with the sauce though. Stay away from the beef bulgogi. We ordered the beef bulgogi once and it wasn't that great. Another thing is that they dont have steamed egg which can be disappointing.   In all cases, I prefer Hobak, Magal, or DOH.. Although Hobak and Magal aren't AYCE, quality and taste matters. is what Hobak and Magal exceed in. Other than that, I will continue to come back here with friends once in awhile.",

    "text": "Very good Korea BBQ at a very reasonable prices for both lunch and dinner. The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working/living in this part of Las Vegas.  Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.  There seems to be a lot servers/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change).   I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.  Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.  They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).  As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.  Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).  As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.  So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.

    "text": "I've eaten at Gen KBBQ in LA, so I was very excited for them in open in Las Vegas! Because they just opened, expect a very long wait, regardless of your party size. A table for two at 8pm on a Friday took 1.5 hours to get seated. Fortunately, they have a very innovative check-in system where they take your phone number and text you when you are almost ready to be seated, so you can walk around the connecting mall to kill time. They even have an app so you can monitor your place in line.   Dinner - $19.95/person - 32 items + about a dozen more items from the appetizer menu! Very good price (considering a lot of KBBQ AYCE joints are over $20), wide selection, and qualify food. I especially loved that the jap chae (glass noodle) is included because most places account it as a separate item outside of their AYCE menu.   Service is in progress. Our guy forgot simple needs like white rice and waters after being prompted twice, and I was sooo thirsty in between eating all the salty dishes. But I won't ding them on that because he seemed new, and I applaud him for keeping his composure amidst a very busy night! Things should pick up after some months.  Gen is definitely my go-to for KBBQ in Las Vegas!",

Very attentive and constantly will ask if you want anything else. Yes Please!  Food is top notch! The kids loved cooking on the hot plate.  The only negative (for me) is the smoke from the burning fat on the grill. There isnt an air vent to help with air circulation. So once you walk out you'll smell like a Korean BBQ Restaurant. So for that I took off 1 star.   Go try it!!",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place due to all the rave reviews. I went here within 9 days of opening, and there were already over 155 reviews due to the soft opening. It speaks for their reputation carrying over from California.   I like their text messaging system during the wait, so you can walk around the mall. We were told that the wait would be 30 at most so stayed put at the bar area, but it was rather 45 minutes, and that's a lot when you're starving. I WAS HAAAAAAANGRY.   A great idea and concept that they have a variety of tapas available besides korean BBQ--there is no place like this in Vegas.   One major critique about this place is their grill pan. It's stainless, and without any oil to properly coat it, your meat will stick and get stuck, unless you constantly move it around. This was most challenging for thin cuts like brisket or bulgogi. And evidently, it would burn so quickly so the grill change had to be conducted frequently. On a side note, we had to ask them for something to put on the grill pan, and it wasn't incorporated into the server's routine. Not sure why we had to ask, since it would save them extra work (changing pans) if they came up with a way to prolong the grill pan cook cycle.   We tried a variety of meats, and I wasn't too impressed with the quality, but what can you do for $19.99/person. It's a sweet deal. Service was highly disorganized, where you'd ask for your bill to the server, but some lady would come with an iPad to do this transaction separately. I get that each person has a role, but, it took about 15 minutes for us to get the bill, and as they charged for 4 people instead of our head count of 3, we waited for another 10 minutes for them to correct their mistake.   Since they have barely opened, and are still short-staffed in comparison to the demand, there was a lot of chaos, disorganization, and some confusion, which I assume will be figured in time. I think most important is that even if the organization were resolved, I wouldn't go back due to the quality of the meats and food being average.",

    "text": "A sight for sore eyes here in Henderson! (Especially for those SoCal peeps that crave KBBQ like I do sometimes)  The recently opened Gen is at the Galleria at Sunset mall in Henderson. The restaurant is not attached to the mall however. It is located directly to the left of the main mall entrance.   I have been long awaiting a good KBBQ joint since I moved to Vegas. And as luck would have it, it just opened in Henderson!  I visited the second day of opening so things were still being kicked into gear with the staff and service so I can forgive some blips that we had like missed orders and the waitress dropping a glass of water on my friend. (ooops)  The AYCE menu is extensive and very reasonably priced imo. $14.95 for lunch (open-3pm) and $19.95 (3pm-close)! Appetizers are included in the price as well. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu with a few 'premium' items left off.   Of note, I really enjoyed the chadol (beef brisket), beef tongue, spicy rice cake, garlic pork belly and agedashi tofu! Granted, there wasn't anything I didn't like, but you get the idea. They were missing the pineapple steak from the menu, however. And I wasn't a huge fan of their side dishes :( There is no rice paper here but they do give you thin radish slices to wrap everything in!  They also serve alcoholic beverages but I didn't indulge this time around. The parking is also plentiful in the mall lot. The decor is very swanky and modern which I enjoyed and there is greattttt ventilation (which my KBBQ veterans will know is very very important)  It's a great addition to Henderson and Vegas and excited to have a place to satisfy my KBBQ/meat cravings now :O",

They've completely destroyed all essence of Korean flavor in all their dishes.   Meats were not marinated or presented well-incredibly bland and not of good quality. I want to say they have tried to make this place mainstream and by doing so made kbbq terrible. For example, they had bloody French fries and fricken nacho cheese garlic chicken in their menu-it'd be fine if it was good but it was really just awful.   Overall, Portions small, flavorless meats, not tender, service was slow, not authentic.",

The only thing I was a little bummed about is that some of the appetizers are seasonal.  The bean sprouts in particular are one of my favorites...but at least they had the potato salad.

The food was good and it's ALL YOU CAN EAT! If you like beef or pork, this will surely satisfy your hunger. They also have side dishes/appetizers like seaweed salad (YUM!), kimchi and popcorn style shrimp- to name a few. They have a full bar so that, if you wanted, you could pull up to it and have a few cocktails, or you could have them served to your table. The drinks are not included in the all you can eat price of $14.95 for lunch, but you really cannot beat that price. Give them a try, especially if you have never experienced Thai BBQ before!",

We are at our vacation home in Las Vegas and looked up best Korean BBQ and found Gen in Henderson.  So our standards started out pretty high.  The meats are delicious and a huge variety for the price! The sides are also wonderful and tasty.  They don't have steamed eggs but they offer a big selection of appetizers that are pretty good.  The environment is one of the best and very hip and trendy, with blue LEDs to create the ambiance!  Hopefully, it will be kept up and cleanliness not let go. The only negative I have is the shortness on wait staff.  They have so many hostesses up front, who btw don't seem too sharp; but waitstaff availability was a bit scarce; they were excellent but just very busy and not enough of them.  Enjoyed our meal and will return and hope they address the shortness on waitstaff.",

We asked two different servers to find Sam and 20 minutes later, still nowhere to be found. We had to go up to the hostess to pay our bill. We still tipped him $5, but he definitely did not deserve it. So you're welcome Sam.   Overall, I would recommend the food at Gen. However, if your server is Sam, I'd ask for a different one.",

Walking in, I already had a biased opinion formed due to my terrible experience at their TUSTIN location. I can't say I had a better experience this time around either.  I understand this is a pretty new location but the kids all seemed young an inexperienced.  They also need to step up their banchan portion game! This was also an issue at the Tustin location. I asked for extra kimchi. They bring the little thing with TWO pieces in it. TWO! I was like Oh gee. Can I have a BIG BOWL of kimchi please, perhaps with MORE than TWO pieces in it? Thaaaaanks! I mean, seriously. Wtf. Banchan + Korean BBQ go hand in hand! Especially kimchi! What the damn hell! Besides, the more I ask you for something, the more annoying it is for BOTH of us. I am an unhappy guest with no kimchi and you are an unhappy employee who had to keep going back and forth to bring me said kimchi! How bout just a niiiiice portion size to keep your guests satisfied?? They have little banchan anyway, meaning not much variety, as well as TINY portions.  They didn't have rice paper. They didn't automatically give you garlic and jalapenos.  They do have appetizers you can order which is different and they also have some lunch box options which is nice too. That's about the only positive thing i can say. Oh and thank you RICHARD for changing our charred grill. Even tho we were pretty much done eating it was still nice of him!  We only had the beef brisket, premium pork belly and spicy pork. It was all pretty MEH.  The banchan was pretty mediocre as well.  This is the third and LAST time I will ever waste my time, money, and calories at any GEN restaurant again!",

    "text": "This isn't your ordinary Korean BBQ restaurant! It is actually new and for the price, the service and the atmosphere, you can't beat it. If you like Korean BBQ especially All You Can Eat, I definitely suggest this as a bucket list when you're in Las Vegas, it's a little ways off the strip but definitely worth it!  The set up is pretty modern. It almost looks like a nice night/bar club, with neon lights to eccentric the visuals and seating from high top tables to regular booth tables. Unlike most KBBQ places, this place is well ventilated and doesn't hit you with that strong BBQ smoke smell. The ventilation system used here is actually different from others that I've experienced. Most other places have an overhead vent that sucks the smoke out, however here, they have it built into the actual stove. So when you are cooking you meals, the smoke is instantly sucked right back down. Don't worry it doesn't affect the taste, or smell of the food.  The price to do all you can eat was only $14.95 and that included your big list of meats to choose from, up to 20 different types of meat! You can't beat that, most other places only give you from a range of 3 - 6 types of meat. Also to add, the All you can eat also includes appetizers! So for that price and the ability to PIG OUT, definitely can't pass that up. I would definitely recommend to try everything! The different marination of pork bellies, to bulgogi, to cajun shrimps and squids.   If you are wanting to enjoy a alcoholic beverage, they also have a bar there that serve pretty good signature drinks. I had a Lychee Martini and it was on point! Especially for the price of $2.83! If I wasn't so beat up from Sin City, I would have ordered more!   The service is great, all the servers take time to come serve you and help one another out. They are also using modern technology (tablets) to take your order so that helps expedite ordering. They even use a tablet with a portable receipt printer so you don't even have to wait long to pay, they'll take care of you right then and there!  Definitely recommend! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I reeeeeally didn't want to give this place 1 star, but I didn't have a choice. Let me start by saying this is my absolute favorite KBBQ place in LA (born and raised there, and I was so excited about its LV arrival). I live on the south west side, and am rarely ever in Henderson. Let's face it, if you're gonna cross the 15, it's gonna be a whole day event!  We tried to go in after the UNLV/UCLA game @ Sam Boyd, and figured we'd have plenty of time since they close at 12. We left the game at the start of the 4th quarter and got to the restaurant at 10:55pm, and figured we made it right on time. Unfortunately, the hostess informed us that they weren't taking any new tables. We asked them what time they close, and she said 12, but the kitchen closes at 11. We asked them, just for future reference, what time their last seating is, and she suggested we arrive at least by 10:30pm.   If that's the case, then there needs to be some kind of warning or signage or something! Unless it is mentioned otherwise, a restaurant's last seating is typically when the restaurant closes.   Definitely not sure if or when I'll be back because I have no idea when I'll be back in Henderson. I had such high hopes for this place and am really disappointed in my first visit there.   Sidebar: not sure how I feel about rumors of offering free beverages in exchange for good a review, either.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of six adults, two babies, and one toddler. We couldn't fit at one table so they split us up with two booths next to each other which is fine. The decor is very spacious, modern, sleek, and with the blue neon lighting throughout the restaurant, it has a trendy, loungey feel to it. They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday. Since this restaurant is new and popular, we didn't want to wait an hour. We turned out to be right because people started coming in and they got busy with people waiting.  They charge the $19.99 dinner price for lunches on weekends. $14.99 for lunch on M-F. Dinner is $19.99 everyday. You can order four apps and meats at a time. The servings are small. Some people have complained about the portion size but I actually like it. That way, I can try more things and I tend to be a greedy KBBQ eater. I order too much sometimes. They were out of a few apps that day which I wanted to try. Out of the apps, I liked their sesame chicken the best. Their kimchi is really good too. I find that if I like the kimchi a restaurant serves, I usually end up liking the food as well.  We ordered beef brisket, Cajun shrimp, galbisal, miso pork belly, beef tongue, chicken bulgogi, and beef short rib plate. We repeated some of the orders. I like the galbisal the best. I liked the seasoning on the Cajun shrimp but it was too much work peeling the shrimp. I rarely get chicken because it takes too long to cook and I'd rather eat red meat. We only ordered it because my friend's kid likes chicken.   We received VIP service. Our waters were constantly refilled, our grills were changed 6-7 times, got more banchan, and the servers checked up on us often. The cons: no gyeran jjim (steamed egg), doenjang chigae (fermented soybean soup) and no dduk bo ssam (rice wrappers). Also, I'm not a fan of their grills. They don't have an overhead hood system. The grill burned too quickly and it needed to be constantly changed. However, you don't leave with that terrible KBBQ smell on you so I like that part.  I haven't been to the CA location but looking at the pictures, their portions seem larger and they offer more items. I'll have to visit one of the CA locations to compare one of these days. Other than the lack of some KBBQ staples and the grill burning too quickly, it's a pretty good deal to satisfy your KBBQ fix. I felt so fat and satiated after.",

The meats are some of the most fresh I have ever had, and our server Lisa (along with like, five other servers) kept them coming at breakneck speed!  The buzz is hot right now, so expect at least a 45 min to an hour wait on Friday and Saturday. I'm sure some of the hype will die down eventually, and so will wait times. But even so, totally worth it. I live only 10 minuets from here, so I know I will be here often.  Lunch prices for AYCE are $14.99, Dinner is $19.99, and that includes sides as well. Gen has upwards of 6 or 7 locations, so they must be doing something right. Come see for yourself!",

We had a party of 12 on a Wednesday and were given an hour to an hour and a half wait which we begrudgingly accepted. Close to an hour and a half later, we went to check on the status of our table and were told we would have to wait even longer than our original wait time because there were no tables big enough for all of us and no two six-person booths across the aisle from each other. So, we opted to sit at two different six-person tables on either side of the restaurant. Horrible planning on the staff's part and that is why I had to dock two stars.  As for the food, it was delicious and an amazing experience to cook it at your own table. We tried the pork belly, ribeye, etc. Pretty much a wide range of the selection offered on the menu. I would definitely go back for the food. Overall, it was a good experience and our server was super nice, but the wait time and issue with the large party was frustrating.",

If they wanted us out, since they were closing \"soon\" (last call was 11:30) they could've replaced our pans to cook more frequently to be able to cook the food faster. It was my sister's birthday and they separated our party of eight across the room. We couldn't even see each other. They took advantage of the gratuity and were completely useless the whole night.

    "text": "This place blows - don't be fooled by the 4-5 star reviews given from the freebie promotion they ran during their grand opening phase.  Please ignore the people who proclaim this is the best AYCE or Korean BBQ they've ever had.  It's not even close to that -  I would say it's the worst in Vegas.    Pro's - cheap, 20 bucks, a lot of variety to choose from, and while you wait you can kill time in the mall and dl an app that shows you your place in line which is updated frequently   Cons - oh boy.....  Gimmicky and lacks any Korean culture/experience.  Waiters aren't knowledgable of food.  You can only order 4 orders of meet and they are TINY portions.   We must have placed a good 5-6 orders.  A plate of brisket will have 9-10 pieces.  Everything you pretty much have to ask for like sesame sauce, rice.  They don't offer rice paper or lettuce.  The meats are average at most.  A few of the apps were frozen.  I could go on....  Pretty much go anywhere else.  If you wanna save money then go to Hwaro which is the same price. Or pay 15 bucks more for dinner and get much better food at Lees.  Or pretty much go anywhere else but here.  This place seriously sucks a55.",

    "text": "Tonight was my boyfriend and I's first time at Gen. We finally had a day off together for us to go on a date. To start off I went to the register to get a table, but when I went up the host and the two servers ignored me and proceeded with what they were doing. Fine, I understand it was busy, but they could have said \"we will be with you in a moment\", but they acknowledged me without saying a word. To keep this review somewhat short the waiter (he had a pony tail and glasses) forgot half of our order and we had to constantly remind him to bring our food. After we finished our first order we were ready to place another, but when we looked over the waiter was on his phone. We were left without food for a good 20 minutes, my boyfriend got so upset that he spoke with the assistant manager (Bryan); he did offer to only charge us for one person but when the check came he charged us for two. Apparently the server was off, but he didn't let us know, and we had to order from the busser that was clueless on what the restaurant served. We also asked another server if they had a certain soup and he said \"I don't know\" and just walked away. Honestly if we didn't say anything I think we would have been left at our table without service and food. In the end my boyfriend had to ask for a refund since we basically didn't eat anything. I expected a lot from this restaurant since they are extremely popular in L.A.",

And when the birthday boy got the check it's only shows 20%. I really wanna know how dare he lied to a birthday boy which is only 19 years old! This is not about training system , this is about their personality. Really disappointing of Gen group also really disappointing of UNLV. Cuz the person who lied is graduated from UNLV. Really wanna know with his personality how does UNLV let him graduated. Second , I checked all the reviews. Pretty much there have a lot ppl had same experiences. Why Gen group they never improve ? Looks like they even don't care about what we wrote. I know Gen is only open a month . So what? If u guys not ready for open a business like this. Then finish the training . Don't open when you are not ready.  Third, just wanna let everybody know I went to Gen in LA before. the service and food quality r better than Gen Las Vegas . Much better. At least Gen @ LA they didn't lied about discount.",

They also have an app that displays your spot in line, which is very helpful. Our server Howard / Yuhao, was exceptionally friendly. He provided great customer service, very accommodating to our every need. He explained the menu to us, like how the appetizers come with the price of $20 per person. The coca cola drinks are refillable, not like some kbbq places where you buy sprite by the can lol. My wife and I ordered the usual brisket and beef bulgogi. On top of that we ordered spicy chicken, Cajun shrimp, marinated beef steak. For our appetizers ordered the popcorn shrimp and Gyoza. I'm going to make this short and simple. The brisket is the business. Bulgogi could be a hit or miss depending if you like it more sweet or not. The Cajun shrimp was a miss for me, as it was lacking in flavor. The spicy chicken, it is delicious especially since I love spicy food. The marinated beef steak is delicious, has a nice garlic kick to it. For appetizers I liked the popcorn shrimp, the Gyoza was very lackluster. Overall the dinner was awesome! I suggest you ask for Howard as he was really tentative to our every need! I'll see you soon Gen kbbq!!",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Pretty decent AYCE price, some good picks on the menu, and an overall unique vibe. With the huge spacious interior and counter-style seating areas, it almost feels like you're eating in a very modern adult-sized lunchroom.  My main issue was their lack of preparation and efficiency. This restaurant ran out of rice... RICE! We had to sit waiting with our ready-to-grill food for a solid 20-30 minutes before rice was served. If it was any other item, I wouldn't have knocked a star off my review - but any person who has had K-BBQ knows rice is the most necessary part of your meal. They also gave us a crazy small (and laughable) portion of edamame so I assumed they were low on that too.  I know they are reasonably new and having such a large restaurant (with so many mouths to feed) must be an adjustment, so I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and hope not to experience that same problem again. Our server was very nice to us and I'd easily come back again, especially during happy hour.",

    "text": "Came here with family for the second and I honestly don't understand the hype.  The meat taste good however the more we ordered the thinner the cuts of the meat got. Which I don't understand as I am paying for AYCE. If this is the case then I should've just gone to another kbbq place that would not have skimped out on my orders.   The wait was long 45 minutes which I don't mind if it's for good food. When we got seated we were immediately greeted by a very rude female server. I'm a server myself so I understand what it is like being a server. However the service continued to be ridiculous. They took forever to even take our drink order and it took even longer for the drinks to arrive. Our server just ignored us the whole time. Each time I wanted to order something I basically had to go out of my way to flag down the server which at first didn't bother me because she might have just been overwhelmed but I realized she was going to all the other tables and ignoring us. Everytime I had a question she just snapped at me and was very defensive.   Food was very slow to come out so I honestly just lost my appetite in between the terrible service and the length of time I had to wait for my food.   I will never understand why this place is so popular, I'd rather stick to places that care about their customers.",

He seemed pretty young and inexperienced and definitely very busy. We what are the vegetables for my wife in we had to ask 3 times to get them. We decided to try the AYCE. I thought they would have had a lower price for lunch but on Sunday it's the same price as it is for dinner. That was disappointing.  The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. The kids enjoyed watching me cook the food on the grill which is always fun. But overall, I will stick to the mom and pop Korean BBQ places.",

They have a large variety of meatsfrom seafood, chicken, pork, and red meat and appetizers. I can never get enough of their Japchae noodles-- keep em comin'! Also, there soju is probably one of the better sojus I've had. I almost can't taste the alcohol, BUT it most definitely creeps on you. I recommend strawberry, lychee, mango, and the yogurt flavors.   The only thing I was not a big fan of was their dessert macaroon ice cream. It taste like it's been sitting and it's too hard. Cute ice cream though!",

He was a young kid and was so accommodating. His service was impeccable and we were a pretty needy table. He definitely made our time last night enjoyable. Unfortunately, he had to leave and another waitress served us and wasn't the best. We waited 15 minutes for her to even come and introduce herself and had no food to cook so we were just waiting. Then we waited another 15 minutes for the food to come out. I wasn't too bothered but what really got me upset is we told her it was someones birthday and if they can sing and she completely spaced out and forgot so it never happened. :( Nonetheless, food is great!",

    "text": "I first tried Gen in California and I liked it. You get a nice variety of meats at a very reasonable price. There are some appetizers that are part of the AYCE menu. Price per person depends on when you go: weekday vs weekend, lunch vs dinner. We've been here for lung during the week which is probably the best time to go because you avoid the ridiculous wait during the weekend AND it's only $15 per person.  The banchan was good. From the AYCE menu, we tried: brisket, bulgogi, garlic pork belly, signature steak, KFC, and jap chae. I liked everything especially the garlic pork belly. Yuuuum!!!  The thing I like the most about Gen is that each grill has its own vent. The smoke doesn't even get a chance to go up more than 2 inches - it gets sucked in right away so, you don't end up smelling like grilled meat!  Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich - it's not part of their AYCE menu but it is available. The flavors they have include coffee, vanilla, mango, green tea, etc. They're ok. The macaron shells are very dry and hard. The ice cream in the middle is icy. Skip this and just eat all the meat!",

Im not sure if it's because there's a new management which explains the low-quality meat they offer. I've been here several times this year trying to give this place another shot and there still hasn't been any improvement. The meat tastes awful like you're taking a bite of straight up cow and the seasoning doesn't even help at all. But I will say, the staff are always great here! They make sure to take good care of their guests. But Ive tried way better KBBQ in town that has more to offer than here. Don't think I'll be returning again...",

    "text": "Meh, I don't get the hype over this AYCE KBBQ spot.  Literally everyone has been raving about GEN so I finally went to check it out with a friend who's never had KBBQ before. I was really excited and looking forward to try a newer KBBQ spot in town, especially after hearing all of the positive reviews.   It's definitely the most Americanized AYCE KBBQ I've ever been to. All of the KBBQ places are usually employed by Koreans, smaller hole in the wall type restaurants (besides Sura, which is huge). GEN is located in Galleria Mall and the inside is ginormous and quite colorful. The ventilation is great so you don't have to worry about leaving smelling like a walking piece of grilled KBBQ meat. I couldn't help but notice that they played old school R&B and love songs...(?) The menu also strayed a bit away from a traditional KBBQ menu. Some apps were popcorn shrimp, edamame, and fries (?!?) Interesting choices to say the least.  The meat was subpar. I usually go for brisket but since I was with a newbie, I ordered a variety of meats to share:   - Brisket; Pretty good! Very juicy - Bulgogi; Fatty, the marinade was so-so - Kalbi; Tender, same marinade as Bulgogi but the quality of meat tasted better  - Spicy Pork Bulgogi; One of the more flavorful meats, not very spicy but tasted good. Also fatty - Pork Belly/Smoked Garlic Pork Belly; The slices were SO thin that it cooked really fast. I've cooked pork belly enough times to know when it's time to eat, but these thin slices tasted like pure bacon - Spicy BBQ Chicken; Took FOREVER to cook thoroughly and tasted like a teriyaki stir fried chicken. Definitely not worth the wait. Took over 10 minutes for sure  - Spicy Baby Squid; We ate the legs and not the head. We both actually really enjoyed the flavor  The salad was good and tasted similar as salads served at typical KBBQs. For dipping, we each received soy sauce/vinegar and salt/pepper. I had to ask the server for sesame oil to add into the salt/pepper. The banchan (side dishes) tasted average. We also ordered Japchae (Korean stir-fried glass noodles) which was tasteless and dry and the Fried Gyoza which was unmemorable.   Overall the service was pretty decent. They changed the grill out for us frequently (which was good because the meats would burn and the grill would get black rather quickly... they didn't use any oil on the grills) and our waters were refilled whenever empty. We had to call a server over to order more meats a few times which was the only negative, especially since they weren't very busy on a Weekday afternoon.  I think I went with too high of expectations. Unfortunately I was not impressed. I would give GEN:  -1/5 for the overpowering grill which we kept trying to decrease the heat but would somehow end up burning the grill anyway  -2/5 for the side dishes and apps  -3/5 for the meat taste/quality -4/5 for the overall customer service -4/5 for the ambiance (gorgeous restaurant but doesn't fit KBBQ? The love songs also caught me off guard when trying to feast on meat and kimchi...)  I'd recommend venturing to Spring Mountain for a more authentic and tasty AYCE KBBQ dining experience.",

    "text": "There is an obvious lack of Korean BBQ restaurants in Henderson, so Gen has become my go-to place for a late KBBQ craving.   Environment: The inside is very trendy. Neon lights, a projector, and various sections of seating including low booths, high tables, and a full bar. The lighting is somewhat dim but the overall atmosphere is fun and the restaurant is usually full, however not full to the point where I have ever had to wait for more than 20 minutes for a table.  Food: Going to an All You Can Eat restaurant you obviously must sacrifice a little bit of quality for quantity and that's what you get at Gen. However, they do have a rather extensive menu, with stand outs being the Garlic Calamari, Signature Steak, and Premium Pork Belly. Additionally, they do have happy hour later at night which gives you a couple dollars off Beer and Soju.  Service: The service is overall good. They are typically adequately staffed and even if my server seems out of reach there are various other employees habitually checking up on us. Additionally, they are attentive in bringing all the sides I typically request.  Overall, Gen is reliable option for KBBQ if you are in Henderson and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown.",

They serve everything from premium steak to brisket to bulgogi to pork belly to short ribs. The first few meat dishes that you order will come out more fresh than the subsequent dishes which appear to be more frozen. Banchans are simple and they give about eight different dishes to try. Beverages such as soda, teas, and alcohol are not included and come at an additional cost. Dessert is also not included, however macaron sandwiches can be included for an extra $3.95. All in all, a typical kbbq spot with mediocre service and mediocre quality of meat.",

The two stars is for the time advertised of closing, which is 12am, on all platforms, Yelp, Google, etc. What is not advertised is the last seating time, 11pm. I completely understand a last seating, average Korean BBQ customers do take awhile to eat, so a last seating makes sense. What is not understandable is the fact that My girlfriend and I walked up to be seated at 10:55, 5 minutes before last seating, and an hour before actual closing time, and the door was locked. I waved at a couple of workers there, looked like they were hanging around in the booths, the man looked at his phone with annoyance, walked slowly up to the door, unlocked it and said, \"Sorry guys we closed 10 minutes early tonight.\" I said, \"but you guys close in an hour and 5 minutes\" to which he responded, \"we closed before the last seating.\"  Very disappointing to come all the way across town, thinking we made it over an hour before closing time, just to be turned down because the workers wanted to close 1 hour and 10 minutes earlier than advertised.",

With an AYCE lunch price of onlyyyyy $17/person, how can you not come in for lunch?! Usually places like this are over $20, so this place is practically a bargain - a delicious bargain! My girlfriends and I came in around 1:30p and were seated with the quickness! Our server Natasha was awesome and very attentive!   The concept is super easy, you order from their 32 meat/seafood selection with some items already cooked, otherwise it's raw and you cook it at the table grill. This experience is fun and interactive!   The meat favorites are the premium steak, Bulgogi, brisket, VOLCANO chicken!, spicy pork bulgogi! Also order the salad, the salad is bomb!   Enjoy!",

Way more 'upscale' than other KBBQ places I've been to.  It's chic, clean, and if i didn't know better, I wouldn't think it was a KBBQ restaurant!  The menu is vast and at $21.99 for AYCE dinner with 36 options to choose from, we were ready to get our feast on!  Plate after plate of gogi came out one after the other.  My favorites will always be the samgyeopsal (premium pork belly), chadolbaegi (gen premium chadol), galbi (gen signature galbi), & there was this one other dish that we ordered that I just couldn't figure out what it was!  I kept ordering thinking it was one dish, but a different dish would come out. Haha.   Maybe it was the beef belly?  Not sure, but it was a thicker cut of meat and so freaking tender.  The Hawaiian steak was also pretty darn good.  I didn't take very much photos of the food because I was way too busy cooking and eating!    Our waiter was incredibly patient with us and super friendly.  We did come in a bit late (a little under an hour before closing) and we were one of the last to leave, but our waiter never made us feel rushed and he was just overall super cool.  He never left us wanting and changed our grills out and filled our waters in a timely fashion.  Overall, really enjoyed myself here and loved all the dishes I tried.  My stomach was at the brink of maximum capacity towards the end of the evening, but I always, always leave room for dessert. I ended the night with dessert (duh) in the form of a macaron sandwich filled with strawberry ice cream.  The macaron cookie was perfect with a thin crunchy outside and soft inside.  Delish!  Looking forward to coming back here next time I am in Vegas.",

Get a reservation if you are coming on a weekend night. We had to wait 30+ min for ours. But luckily it's located in a large shopping complex, so if you are stuck waiting, you can walk around like we did. The short rib was my favorite, but honestly all of the meats on the AYCE menu are very very good. All were excellent quality meats. The sides I thought were plentiful too. Caution with the salad because they give you a huge portion. Service was nice and the drinks were fun. We got the alcoholic peach in a pitcher and we were able to share that with a large group.",

Our dinner last night was by far the best experience we had. Friday night and there was no wait for dinner for 2-4, got sat right away and shown that it was happy hour and given the specials. Our server Jay was fantastic and made some great recommendations and helped us through the menu when we had questions.  Their menu has a large mix of meats/seafood options. They have the traditional small bite items on the table that welcome you to Korean BBQ. Also on the menu are a few kitchen prepared items that are included with the AYCE, Korean fried chicken, jap chae, and a couple others. A few of the standout items: Beef Bulgogi (probably the number 1 item), brisket, short rib and beef toungue!  One thing that stood out on this visit more than those in years past was how fast the service was. Honestly I don't think it ever took them longer than 2 minutes to bring out any of the orders that were placed. This is awesome because, you don't want to spend a bunch of time waiting on food you then have to cook yourself.  Definitely a great place for either the novice or veteran KBBQ visitors. With such a good value for money and consistently good quality and service, I will very much continue to go, and so should you!",

The booths are spacious and the tables have enough space for your AYCE experience.  The staff has always been great with checking up for more orders, keeping the drinks fresh and replacing the grills timely.  The service has been consistently good even during packed visits.  Gen Korean BBQ:  My favorite appetizers are: Jap Chae, Gyoza and the Cheese Pork cutlet.  I dig how the pork cutlet is stuffed with cheese inside.  My favorites for the grill are: Signature pork chop, premium steak,  the pork and spicy pork bulgogi, beef belly and the spicy baby octopus.  The spicy baby octopus is especially tasty to me as it's packed with flavor and not too spicy.  The bulgogis are solid and the premium steak is flavorful.  The banchan/side dishes are tiny in portion but the servers are good with getting you re-stocked when you ask.  Overall for the price, Gen provides a good ayce Korean BBQ experience.  The service is very good and the quality of the meat is fair for the price you're paying.  They are a safe space when I'm feeling AYCE Korean BBQ on my side of town.   Enjoy!",

For anyone who has never experienced True Korean Barbecue, you'll love it! Your kids will love it, your date will love it! You get the idea. It's an experience. Let me explain, you're not just eating the food... you're cooking it! If you're not a conversationalist, then you'll have something to keep you occupied. If you're not a cook, you'll learn. If you like to be waited on, let someone at your table take over. If you don't cook the food, you won't eat the food! Hahaha!   Anyway, it's truly a blast! There's a large variety of dishes on the menu! And the staff will certainly help you get started! Oh and be prepared to smell like barbecue when you leave! Hahaha  Give it a try and have fun!",

The price for the all you can eat lunch is affordable, $16.99 per person and the food that comes out of the kitchen is well marinated that after you cook it, the flavors burst in your mouth. You also have the option to not have rice with your meat but ot can be substituted with radish.  We have gone to this place many times and have celebrated many occasions here.  Just like the last time, I recommend this place for all to enjoy! Satisfaction guaranteed.",

    "text": "Four of us were seated as soon as we walked in, at a table with dishes of food already on it. We thought it was weird and looked around to see if it was just maybe our table already set and ready but they all already had food on them. That was strange to us but we moved on.   The server came over and took our drink order and we asked how the menu worked and told him that we've never had Korean bbq before. He told us about the few cooked items and the rest being raw. We started with calamari, spicy octopus and some sort of meat. The octopus came out a literal  octopus. I mean I've eaten it before but holy crap. And, we were given scissors and chop sticks to use. ?????? We couldn't eat it, we moved on. The calamari came out alright and the meat was good.   We asked for soy sauce a little ways in for our rice and we were brought a small little dish with four compartments all filled with soy sauce. There were four of us there....all sitting at different parts of the table anddd we had no silverware so I guess we all were supposed to share?   We also ordered raw shrimp, I was excited for that, those should be good. When they were done, I tried to peel them. All four of us at the table tried to peel one. Not a single one of us could peel it and eat it so I can't even tel you how it was. It would be helpful if they were at least precut down the back for easy peeling later.   The good things. Service was great, confusing as heck, but great. Our server was nice, the porters were working hard. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out. The layout was cool.   The macaroon dessert was killer! I could eat many of those. If they explained more about cooking and gave more utensils and just made it all around easier to be able to cook and eat, I would totally go back.",

    "text": "I tried this place during the 2019 Vegas Restaurant Week, but before going any further, let me set the stage.   I'm a HUGE fan of Korean BBQ, so my bar is really high. With that said, I felt this place was all-around very good in terms of food, service, value, and ambiance.   The food at Gen Korean was close to some of my favorite. However, the meat didn't quite satisfy me as my favorite go to Korean BBQ Vegas spot. Nevertheless, this place was up there. You cook the meat yourself, so you can't complain about that, but I did feel the seasoning wasn't entirely my favorite---or maybe it's because my favorite spot has dipping sauces and this place has dipping seasonings? I don't know.  The service was on point. Nothing negative to say. Great staff.   The value was on par with other Korean BBQ spots in the area. However, I was admittedly a bit disappointed to see their Restaurant Week deal wasn't really a deal at all. It was all you can eat as is their menu, and basically you received a free drink OR desert. Kind of strange to not give a but more off the price of the all you can eat Korean BBQ.   The ambiance is where this place rose to the top. Many Korean BBQ spots I've been to (including my favorite) don't have the most comfy seating or fun/happening lighting. But this place does. I think I only saw cozy booths in this place, and not the old school booths found in diners, but fancier and more posh booths. I almost felt like I was in a Vegas night club, hahaha.   I will definitely be back.   Take it from this UNLV Professor, the final grade is a B+ with the breakdown as follows:  Food  B Service A Value B Ambiance A+",

I would say this location is just ok. I don't know why but for some reasons our meats burnt pretty easily here and they stick to the grill. We tried lowering the fire and also cook the fatty meat first so we would get the grease on the grill. It was also weird for me that they serve the tofu soup in regular bowl - most places will serve it in the stone bowl.   Overall, it's not a bad experience but some things are a little bit different compare to other Gen locations I've been to. When we were here, our waiters have been very attentive. They always come back to take our meat order and clear our plates. So can't complain there. I'll probably come back often because It's the closest Korean bbq place from where we live.",

Another company in Las Vegas, which would rather prefer GREED over acceptance.  I am here with my family and friends. It's hard to deter an entire group from eating somewhere, just because I eat less than my 3 year old.   It is 2:30pm on Sunday- August 25, 2019. Owner, please speak with your manager on duty.   --- Foodwise- Gen Korean BBQ is a 5* dining facility. Great atmosphere. Great good.

They have a variety of items that range from cooked volcano chicken to delicious beef bulgogi.   I came with a party of 6 and they had the high chairs which is a first for me. They are a bit less roomy than the rest of the seating so I found my self dropping my chopsticks twice through my visit. So if you have a smaller party you get a booth which is lovely and roomy.   I will have to say they were super quick with getting out the meat to the point that the drinks came out later than the meat. I'd have to say they were pretty quick with that but we found  ourselves with about 7 to 10 empty plates on our table waiting to be taken away which left us with even less room.   The flavors of some of these dishes are outstanding. We had ordered about 3 different raw chicken dishes but didn't get to taste any of them sadly because they were being shared for 4 people.  We did get to try the volcano chicken a cooked dish that was pretty good its spicy but it doesn't hit you until your 3rd or 4th one but I definitely reccomend.   This comes along with a recommendation for the premium chadol (Beef brisket) it's one of those that are a quick cook and good with the sides they have to offer. The Jep Chae (glass noodles) are a good side with any dish such as the spicy pork belly yum.   This place is gonna be one of those that I come to anytime i have a craving for Korean bbq that's for sure.",

We actually just made one in Hawaii and it's a little more expensive for lunch/dinner prices but at least the service is SPOT ON in Hawaii. First we were being served by a girl and then all of a sudden, she stopped serving us and a guy started serving us. I asked her two times to PLEASE give me extra dipping sauce. She totally disregarded it and just helped someone else. I had to ask our *new server* as well, two-three times he passed by and I had to ask again, and again. He finally brought it to me, it was filled in a super big bowl.  Although we're going to different Yakiniku places, they should always have a set standard. If our grill is burning, and we ask you to change it. Why question us? We asked if they even change it while we're there and the guy looked at us with a confused expression ????? He came over to change our grill, he asked us to scrape our own meats and veggies by ourself then he was gonna change it. Everywhere you go, if it's not a fully self-serving place then they're supposed to do it for us but wtf??? Then he just says \"we don't do that.\" By then we already lost our appetite.   Overall, Customer service sucked. The quality of the meat here was not good, everything was mediocre. There  is so much more better Korean Yakiniku restaurants to go to in Vegas, don't fckin go here!! Save your money and go else where. As for the workers, you guys should come to Hawaii and see how much more an enjoyable experience you'll have, and the great service you would receive when you're at a properly trained Restaurant.",

Grill was changed when I asked and the food took 2 minutes to come to the table so we could cook it :) the only thing I wish was that the AC was stronger. I know we are cooking on grill in the middle of the table and this is Vegas and it was 115 outside but when I got in here the temperature was almost the same as the outside.  I suggest come friends and groups. Lunch menu is great for 16.99 and dinner is the same plus a few extra that are worth it if you come in hungry for 21.99.",

We were almost full and were hungry by the time he finally came to get our next order. Even after asking for kimchi and salad twice, we never got it and our waiter finally brought our kimchi after all our food was gone and we were literally about to pay. The food was great just like my first experience, but the service was not and needs improvement.",

Our server's name was Raymond and I have to say he was awesome. Raymond was very attentive, patient and polite despite the busyness of the restaurant and the eagerness of our kids.   Dinner at Gen is always delicious and their huge selection of meat is great for my picky eaters. The atmosphere is beautiful with their chic decor. The restaurant is clean and they have a great set up.   Always a five star experience at Gen, but tonight I wish I could give six stars for Raymond.",

They aren't super picky about meat quality either so they enjoyed the food as well.  The service was off though, we were greeted by a young man that started us off and introduced himself to be our server..  How ever he disappeared shortly after we got started.  After 10 minutes or so another male server took over and he was REALLY nice but you could tell he was slammed and was trying to handle many tables.  No manager ever came by and asked how things were and I felt the quality of the meat was low.  No chicken breasts, only thigh meat and the red meat/steak was fatty.  No many veges to choose from either.  We will go back if our kids request it but not for our own benefit.  If the service issue hadn't happened I prob would have given them 4 stars.",

The best was the KFC chicken from the apps. Idk what's in it but the sauce with the crispy chicken was great. We had 4 of those orders.  The grilled chicken was the only bad part. The spicy chicken was the best one just wish the pieces of chicken were a bit thinner because they took a long time to cook and 2 of us did it eat any beef or pork only chicken and shrimp.  OMG the Cajun shrimp was the best part we literally had 5 orders and each order came with 5 shrimp. We got our money's worth with just the shrimp.  Just beware the shrimp is with the head and not deveined, if that doesn't bother you it's a must try.",

I was really excited to share this with my husband as something different and what I hoped would be as great as what I had as a teen.   Umm yeah. Our first server was terrible. At the beginning, I asked how it worked (since we had not been here before) and she didn't explain anything other than it is all you can eat, but make sure you read the clauses at the bottom of the page on the menu. Didn't explain the 4 random dishes sitting on the table already, how it works, etc. Whatever. I asked for soy for my hubby, and she looked at me like I was insane. SOY? WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY??? What Kind of establishment do you think we run here? You have some, well you have a sauce, that isn't soy, it's slightly sweeter, but there ya go. Fortunately, we were taken over by a new server after our initial order. We did manage to get some soy too.   Food- It was sad. Maybe we hit an off day, or maybe it just is crap, but the quality is nothing. The pre-cooked things were all either overcooked, hard, or stale. Nothing was fresh. Nothing. Second note, if you get the marinated shrimp, ask them if there is a technique to get the shells and heads off without totally getting it everywhere. I had no such luck and had so much gunk all over my hands trying to get it apart. UGH. There was no flavor to anything. It just had no redeeming quality, aside from our second server, the bussers, and cooktop swapper were all incredible friendly and nice. We tried almost everything, and I can't say I would try any of it again. 2 stars just because it is all you can eat (again, read the clause on the menu....and note they have cameras on the facility...in case you were thinking of slipping some chewing calamari or cow tongue in your purse to avoid being charged extra for it) , service was nice, and the process is fun.   Won't be back. ever. Love the concept, hate the execution.",

    "text": "Upon arriving - the decor was ok and the staff was friendly.   Once seated, the hostess told me about the all you can eat option, but did not advise that it was mandatory. We ordered drinks (hot tea) that did not arrive until 10 mins into my meal. My Mom doesn't eat meat, only fish, so she ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer. I told our server about this and she didn't say anything. She also ordered the seaweed salad (which never arrived).   Upon receiving the bill, I saw a charge for 2 all you can eat meals. I let the hostess know we only had one AYCE as my Mom is not able to eat meat, so she ordered an appetizer which the server acknowledged. She let me know AYCE is mandatory and she would have to get the manager.   The ONLY reason I am giving this restaurant a 2 star rating is because the manager was extremely accommodating and pleasant about this issue. He didn't hassle me and fixed this issue. He advised that individual pricing is on the menu for appetizers only as a courtesy for lunch, not dinner (again, not explained). Thankfully though, he was great.  The food was OK, nothing like the quality or authenticity you'd receive in China/Korea town.   I will probably never return to Gen.",

The wait was long (30+ minutes on a Monday evening at around 7:30pm for a table for two), but our server, Lisa, totally made up for it. She patiently and pleasantly explained how everything worked and made recommendations for us newbies. We really enjoyed the marinated steak, and my husband loved the pork belly (the garlic and the red wine flavors). I wasn't a fan of some of the unseasoned, thinly cut beef options, but my husband seemed to like them. Lisa provided awesome service and was so nice, which really made the evening for me, especially being more than a little nervous to try this new type of dining experience. I don't know that this will be a new weekly restaurant for us, but we'll definitely come back!",

It's pretty easy to get their attention and they comes around to check if you need anything. The environment is nice, less smoky so the smoke won't be in your face the whole time.  The bad: The food is tasteless. They need to marinate it long. waited for 45 mins for our food, and then we have to reorder them. They probably lost our order because there's a table that came after we order our food and got thee or food already. The portions are small so you have to keep ordering and wait for the food to come.  But we did come on a holiday, maybe they are too busy. I don't know if we will come back again though.",

They told us there was a 20 minute wait turned out to be more like 30 to 40 minutes and all the time l saw there were open tables just sitting there why are you going to make people wait when you have open tables I just don't get it. But things became a little more clear from the hostesses but they don't know what the hell they're doing, walking back and looking at the empty tables over and over again taking my phone number to text me when the seat is ready yet not even using them just calling out my name, and you have waiters thatthat literally said please give me the number instead of the name when ordering it's easier for me. Also it would be easier for you, is to not act like no one's ever asked for soy sauce or to ask us if we are finished over and over, but at least  bring the check at the end of the meal, we had to walk up to the counter because nobody came by for 10 mins?  The food quality and keep mine I have nothing to compare it to other than a one time Korean restaurant was OK then you have the short ribs off the bone and while there was a lot of options there wasn't a lot of blow you away quality when It came to the meats and very little flavor-marinade-sauces  There is definitely value in the $20 the all you can eat and maybe they're still going to improve the service which might put three-four star which in my mind means it is worthy of a least one more shot but I'm not in a rush to go back",

Unfortunately this location did not live up to my expectations. The first reason is that they didn't have the rice paper that the Tustin location has which I loved. Secondly some of the items on the menu was not available for ordering. Thirdly they didn't have the steamed egg that Tofu Hut has which I also enjoy. Lastly the Cajun shrimp had a funny taste which is a bummer since I love eating shrimp. So I guess I have to continue driving across town to go to Tofu Hut.",

There are 29 items you can choose from including raw meats to grill at your table (bulgogi, pork belly, chicken, calamari, octopus,etc.).  plus appetizers. The best items were the rice cake in spicy sauce and kfc (korean fried chicken). Now you might be wondering..why 3 stars? Well, the meats were not really marinated that well...the meats tasted as if they were just dipped in the marinating sauce and served to us. Thus, they had little to no flavor. The \"grill\" itself was weak so it did not impart any \"grill\" flavor to any of the raw foods. The fried items tasted way better. I would say this place is good bc of the AYCE cheap price but weak on grilled flavor.",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night and understandably there was a long wait. 45 minutes for a party of two, but great thing is they can send you a text when your table's ready, eliminating the need to stand around in a cramped area. Allowed some time to do some quick mall browsing. The 45 min estimated wait time was very accurate.   The atmosphere is really nice and feels more like a high-end sushi or lounge type of environment. Definitely not the traditional Korean restaurant look. But the vibe was vibrant, active, and seemed fun. Couple big screen TVs that were airing sports. Seemed more geared towards the younger crowd and families. Decent alcohol selection.  We were seated at the bar. As someone who prefers more privacy when dining, I didn't like it at first, but found that it was a great spot to be seated at since it was easy to flag someone down or have servers continually stop by for orders. Our grill went out several times, but finally someone devised a way to keep the air flow going. I liked that the grill was set down into the table, which helped keep any grease splatters to a minimum.  Highlights: #10 Marinated premium steak - very tender, and was our top meat choice Salad Side dishes - I loved all their kimchis. The cabbage, radish, and cucumber. Just the right amount of fermentation for my tastes.  Average: #17 Smoked garlic pork belly - came with the rind, and was flavorful but a bit too much of a smoked flavor Brisket - used to smaller pieces, and every piece had quite a bit of fat on it Cajun shrimp Fried squid legs - crispy Fried spicy rice cake - I love rice cake so naturally I loved that this was offered. However don't expect the 'spicy' sauce to be in any way similar to ddukbokki (Korean spicy rice cake). It was more of a sweet chili sauce.   Didn't enjoy: Seaweed salad - Seemed frozen, and one of the ingredients in it was overpowering in a bad way  Wanted to try popcorn shrimp, but we were told that they had sold out of it.   Have to ask for rice, sesame oil, soybean paste, garlic/jalapenos.  Let downs: No Korean boricha barley tea, no gochujang (red pepper paste), no soybean or tofu soup, no steamed egg, no rice papers. No desserts (afaik)  Service was prompt and empty plates were taken away efficiently. Unfortunately we forgot to catch everyone's names, but we were helped by several servers who were all friendly and eager to help.  This isn't one of those BBQ places where the server comes by and helps you cook your meats. (Never realized there's people out there who expect the server to cook all your meats for you!)  For $20 a person, Gen Korean BBQ is an awesome deal. Even with a generous tip, it's still cheaper than most other places. What sets this place apart from other Korean BBQ places in Vegas are the atmosphere, service, and much wider menu selection. Definitely a good one to add to the rotation if you're a KBBQ fan.",

Well I have not only  found a gem of Las Vegas here at Gen, but also found the best waiter I've encountered in a while. I don't say this lightly, being that I have waitressed for many years myself . In description a good waiter is, pleasant, sincere, swift with service, engaging, presentable in dress, and mostly goes beyond their descriptive duties to satisfy the customer and give them an enjoyable dining experience. Well, Eugene, my waiter, encompasses all of this and more.  I say this because I have now had him as a waiter twice, and his enthusiasm for serving is contagious ... He suggested that we try \"new\" items, which I enjoyed. He finds out what you really want in your dining and goes the extra mile ... We never had to look around for service, drinks were always full, and we left feeling we got what we paid for and more... So, if you want that dining experience that I have just shared, go to Gen and ask for Eugene!!! I will! .. You Rock Eugene!",

Due to some negative reviews both here and on tripadvisor, it made us wonder how it could be so good for some and so bad for others. I'd say go check it out for yourself. Our waiter was Ozzie. Very nice fellow, took his time explaining how it worked. It is an all you can eat but where you order and they bring it to your table. They bring you as much as you want and they also checked back regularly. I'd suggest the KFC (Korean fried chicken), the pork ___ (I forget what it was called but it is an appetizer that comes out cooked) also the pork steak. The apps come out cooked, the entrees you cook yourself in the center of the table. The regular steak is nice, and is the spicy chicken bulgogi. tip: do not get the brisket. It is too thin, it cooks to nothing. Waste of time really to order that.  The only down side was the Asian hostess was a very sour woman. No smile, nothing. It was as if she really hated her job. I hope she finds a job she likes so she can be happy.",

Drinks were reordered twice before they arrived, several requests for items had to be requested more than once. When the fire went out and the server could not get it to work after several tries he offered to get us to another table, it never happened. After waiting for about 20 minutes in the middle of our meal we decided to pay the check. The manager gave us a 20% discount on our check but never came to the to apologize. I will not be back.",

Our server was great though but i guess theyre understaff? im not so sure coz i just cant explain why their food was coming out so slow. anyways, i was just being patient and waited for our food to come and not complain. so we already ate and everyone was satisfied already. But another incident happened, so at the table located at our side, some crew members were cleaning and all of the sudden a splash of red sauce went through our table and went through our arms and hands. So i immediately turned to my left side and looked at one of the crew member waiting for him to apologize but no he just looked at me and continued on cleaning. I just think that it was just rude of him and they should be more careful cleaning too. i gave three stars for now because of the service and rudeness of one of the crew members. but im just hopeful that the next time we dine here they could hopefully have improvements.",

On our last visit we had a brief wait to be seated, but we seated pretty quick (lunch buffet) and our server came, got our drink order and our meats and we started eating, as we were still cooking/eating the hostess that seated us not 10 minutes before came over with the bill and told us our total. I was really confused as we had barely just sat and she was the one that sat us, I told her that we are still eating and going to order more meats and she said \"oh okay\" and left. About 10 minutes later she came back with check in hand, with the card reader and said \"okay you must be ready by nooooowwww!\" My Husband and I were both completely shocked but more assertive this time and said \"no, we aren't ready we just got here and we are still eating.\" She left and our server came over and we explained what happened, he went to the hostess station and inquired and the hostess had the wrong table. I wasn't very happy with her being so pushy, our server handled it well and he was nice about it. I do really love this restaurant regardless of our last experience.",

Staff is totally inexperienced and no management to train or lead obvious except the only guy over 20 sitting at a rear booth with a computer and never once asked if he could assist. First off, we had no idea what to do with the grill... So when we asked, we turned It on, but it didn't work so we waited to get it lit. Still didn't work, so we waited again for someone else. He had to keep the grill cooking surface at an angle, so veggies rolled down! I asked three people for a fork. Finally went and got one myself. No one explains what/how this dreadful experience works. We got KFC chicken for appetizer and it was stone cold. We put it on our grill. We told our waiter and he said, \"that's great\"! We then had marinated beef, but it burnt the grill and we were told that you should cook raw meat first... And why didn't you tell us that before? Horrible experience with a staff who is totally green. NEVER would we go there again. WE asked for the check and that took ten minutes!!!",

Although I think Tofu Hut is so much better (but thats just my opinion). They have good brisket, but how can you go wrong with brisket? Its not seasoned anyway lol. The main thing I dont like about this place is the dipping they give. Its some type of sea salt with green tea leaves or something Idk but I didn't like it so I asked if they had salt and pepper with sesame oil and they did but again it was sea salt which can be too salty. The meat options are over whelming and their kalbi was not that greatly marinated. the steak was horrible. very dry and unseasoned. The pork belly was good, but again like the brisket, you cant really go wrong with it, its not seasoned. I did like how they often changed the grill out for you when it became dirty. Another reason why I rate this place 4 stars is because of the shrimp that they offer on the menu and the squid legs I believe they have as well. My boy friend orders those two things endlessly. Although I don't eat either of them, he loves them so thats a plus. I've noticed that they have ice cream macaroons which I'd like to give a try but of course you are charges separately for those.",

    "text": "This was my first Korean BBQ experience, and I've got to give the staff at Henderson a big hand for making it a more than enjoyable experience. My hostess seated me quick and explained the process of how KBBQ worked thoroughly and most importantly simply. My waiter was David if I remember correctly and he always managed to check my table despite the place being close to a full house at the time, needless to say the service there was really good.   Onto the food, I got the 32 item dinner and ordered I think 9 different items, 5 of those being appetizers. I loved the appetizers, they were delicious and were cooked already. With that being said, if you're like me and tend to burn things when you cook because you have bad judgement, the other entrees somewhat vary on your own grilling skills. For me burning almost all of my raw entrees, they were all still really really good (I also only really ordered the spicy foods so I can't really speak on behalf of any of the other item choices) and I was so full by the end of it I ended up spending at least 15 minutes in the bathroom.  Since we're on the topic, they've got one of the nicest bathrooms I've ever been to. The dark toned color scheme and dim lights made it really easy on the eyes, I felt as if I was in Van Gogh's starry night, it was so serene. Not only that but the height from the floor to the toilet seat was perfect. I am a 5'5 male, a little short compared to Nevadans, but I swear either that toilet was made for me or I was made for it, didn't even have to go on my toes and get that awkward position where your legs go numb. Not only that but there was a side rail for stability so I didn't have to awkwardly hold my knees or hips, also thought I'd mention it was at the perfect height that just seemed to cater to the comfort of my arms. The toilet seat also wasn't one of those weird small circular seats that just cuffed your butt and suctioned it down as if that would be the spot you'd die in, but an innovative oval-esque shape ending with a pointed tip, seriously, when I call it a porcelain throne, I mean It. Don't even get me started about that rectangular edged iron cast canyon that is the sink, the possible hand washing techniques that could go on in there.....just endless. Gen/10 would eat all the spicy food at Gen again just to reclaim the throne.",

We came in during lunch hours so they gave us the option of  #1 was the lunch special $15.99 & #2 was the Dinner special $20.99, with the dinner special you have more meat options but because I'm more of a chicken type of girl we ordered the lunch special. We sat in a booth that was by the window and the atmosphere was cool laid back kind of place. Now I must warn you it does get hot because everyone is cooking so expect it to be warm. As soon as we sat I know I wanted a adult beverage. I told Ozzy what type of drinks I like and he suggested the flavored SoJu I wasn't sure of which one to get and he told me we could mix flavors! YES! so I went with strawberry and mango OMG was it DELICious. We ordered the Gyoza for our 1st appetizer it's the best I've ever had! It was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. They dipping sauce was lite and tasty and didn't overpower the Gyoza. Our 2nd appetizer was the Cheese Pork Cutlet that was very good it was crunchy on the outside while the pork was tender oozing with cheese, this also came with a dipping sauce and it was good but very strong. For our Entree we had Gen Chadol (Beef Brisket) it was so tender and cooked quickly they give you a dipping sauce and seasoning for your meats. We had Chicken Bulgogi and it was marinated in a sauce that had a little sweetness to it with no need to dip it in any sauce. We did have a few more things but I honestly can't remember what we had since I let my friend do all the ordering but I must say EVERYTHING we ordered was incredible. I'm defiantly going back .... maybe next week.",

Super fast service when you request a meat. Great quality and fresh beef and ck. Full bar is great too. 1 thing that could use a little help is the sides.  not a lot of variety or too great but still an amazing,  clean  and convenient option for Koren in henderson.",

Which I didn't mind because you were able to leave and shop inside the mall. They have this really awesome system were they send you a text letting you know when your table is almost ready. The decor is really nice, clean.   Finally, time to eat. We waited FOREVER for our rice to come. We can't start eating without our rice! Haha. They serve small portions of meat, so your constantly looking for the waiter to make more orders. We're a party of 6. Two small plates of brisket will only satisfy one person. Having to constantly wait for them to bring out more meat & changing the grill just had me annoyed to the point where I just lost my appetite. Everyone looks so puzzled, & disorganized. The food was actually good. Which is why I rated it two stars. It's just the service that killed it for me! I rather go to China Town! :(",

It was alive- great music, a lot of people having a wonderful time with friends, and an attractive decor.   All that aside the food was top notch. There wasn't one item of the 32 meat's provided that wasn't great. Granted, I didn't eat all 32 but gave it a good try!  With that said I will be back as many times it takes to give it all a sample. I know I won't be disappointed.   Lastly, the service was over the top! Krinke was amazing! There wasn't a moment that my girlfriend and I went without. The food came at a perfect rate, the drinks never ran dry, and we felt like we were the only people in a nearly packed restaurant.   Thank you Gen for giving Henderson one hell of a restaurant.. and thank you Krinke for being amazing!  Well done!",

When I go for AYCE I stay clear of the fluffy stuff and go straight for the meat!!   On my most recent trip I tried 8 meats: [1] Beef Brisket, [2] Beef Tongue, [3] Beef Bulgogi, [4] popcorn shrimp [5] Smoked Garlic Pork Belly,  [6] Pork cutlet , [7] Gen Signature Prime Steak, and [8] Marinated Prime rib meat  My favorites are always the , Beef Tongue, and Miso soup. The table is equipped with five side dishes which are bottomless of course. I think what makes this Gen location stand out is their outstanding service. Regardless of how busy the restaurant is, I feel like they are always well staffed and the employees are very quick and helpful. I can't wait until my next visit, so I can stuff my face with more prime meat!",

My husband's friend is a GM from GEN BBQ in California and they have this sauce called GEN sauce. It's a great addition to your bbq we love it. I guess the management here in Vegas couldn't MAKE this sauce but they can give you the ingredients and you would have to make your own. Easy as 1 2 3 but it would be nice to just make it easy. Other than that, everything is awesome. I actually have one of my friends get hooked on this place too. Btw, we live on the other side of the town. It is just worth the drive!",

Server didn't even bother to drop by and ask if we need to order again. Our pans are so dirty that the food tasted burnt. We asked for a replacement but it took awhile as well. Servers cant be found anywhere.   The food is ok, there were other korean restaurant i have been that are way better especially when it comes to customer service.  To manager, you gotta teach your employees customer service because its not about the food alone but how you keep your customers taken care off.

Wasn't a fan of the squid -- tasted squidy aka very previously frozen. However, the Octopus was very yummy that my friend and I ordered it twice.   The venue doesn't really look like their geared for large groups of people, there are roughly about 8-10 table top for large groups, but it's best for solo or 4 people max if you want a shorter wait time.   Tip: the saucy dishes will take longer to cook b/c it coats  the grill, turn the grill on max when you first turn it on so you can get a good sear then lower as necessary :)  Bon Apetite",

Now, For the negatives. This was our 1st time and they explained the menu very quickly.  We had to ask 2x for our noodles and steak and soy sauce.  The HUGE negative is my 12 year old son ordered the ALREADY COOKED Sesame Chicken and after eating most of it he offered me a piece..... it was RAW! We told the waiter. Who apologized. However, I'm sorry but u just fed my child RAW chicken. My son then didn't want anything else to eat.  When the cashier came with the bill she asked if everything was good.... Um no.  I explained to her what happened and all she said was sorry. I didn't expect all of our meals to be free. However, I did expect my sons to be. That would have been customer service.  I can think of better ways to spend 70 bucks and be just as full and not have to worry about food poisoning.",

Our waiter Julius was awesome he gave us great tips on what was tasty so we didnt waste our time on the other stuff! Everyone there was quick and super friendly which made our first experience perfect. Food was was good and they just kept bringing it out . I look forward to the next time hopefully its the same!",

I have been to many Korean BBQ including the ones in Korea.   This place would NOT be on my list to go. The atmosphere is not what I expected. The waiter we had was not friendly. They squished seven adults in a small booth with not enough table space for food to grill and eating. We basically cooked our food ourselves. The condiments were mediocre. No service. Maybe because some of us were Asian? I don't know.  The price is cheap, but so was the quality of the meat. I definitely had better. Overall, the whole experience was not that good. I was hoping I would like something to come back. I think for people who may not have experienced the whole Korean BBQ thinks this is great, but not for me. I will go elsewhere. Too bad, we need a great place in Henderson. In the meantime, I will do this at home or go to the west side of town.",

Gen is now my favor Korean BBQ place!!  We all like the Gen signature steak. We kept reordering it as the meat was so tendon although we cooked it well done. Of course, you will never go wrong with beef tongues and the ribs (kalbi) which are the must order items in any Korean BBQ restaurants. Gen also offers other dishes like spicy octopus (yummy), shrimps, rice cake etc. However, the restaurant doesn't have the steamed eggs...which was a bummer to us :(  One thing we really like about Gen is the smell did not get on our clothes or hairs like most Korean bbq places.  We realized the smoke from the bbq meat goes away from the side of the grill, not the hood hang on the ceiling. Thus the smoke won't go anywhere and that I think it's a very smart design.   By the way, the portions are small. We usually ask the waiter or waitress to place enough order for our party.",

With that being said, nothing less was expected from this particular location. With the restaurant being placed in a trendy plaza across the street from sunset station, it was very easy to find.   I am by no means a food critic, but my opinion holds a restaurant accountable to 3 distinct factors.  Service - Every staff member that helped me during my stay was more than polite. They were not afraid to smile, let alone assert their helpfulness in my dining experience. The professionalism exhibited by each and every one of Gen's employees has lead me to believe that its management team knows exactly what they are doing.  Food Quality - Gen's quality of its side dishes and fresh meat has never failed me in all of my years as a customer. Henderson was no exception.  Ambience - The atmosphere here is no different than its counterparts in Southern California. People not only come here to have the pleasure of eating whatever and however much they'd like, but to also enjoy a pleasant time with family and friends. Whether drunk or sober, my time here is ALWAYS something i can look back to. What's a good restaurant without good memories?  Gen, I love you.",

Trust me I've eaten way better kbbq for less of the prices in town.

The first person I asked was a hostess at the front. Who looked at another hostess and said \"ummm ok\". Who then talked to maybe their supervisor or manager?! Then a server stopped at our table and made sure the hostess already stopped by to close our bill. We said yes and also asked her for a cup in which she responded the same way \"ummmm ok\". The first gal came back and finally told us they don't give cups for drinks to go. SOME FUCKEN BULLSHIT! WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL US THE FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF MAKING US WAIT!?",

I've been to the Gen locations in Southern California and I can honestly say that this location has the BEST customer service I've experienced. The waiters/waitresses are always so attentive and they are on top of grill changes. I wish all restaurants I go to had great customer service like Gen Henderson.  The quality of the meat is always good too. The must-try item on the menu is the Red Wine Pork Belly and their Premium Steak. The appetizers I always get are the Spicy Rice Cakes and the Jap Chae--SOOOO GOOD. They have a new item on the menu, the Volcano Fried Chicken. WARNING: the Volcano Fried Chicken is spicy AF--make sure to order a small portion first to try it out because the spice WILL creep up on you. One thing I wasn't too excited about was the Spicy Baby Octopus, it just wasn't for me.   Because the place is popular, I do suggest that you call ahead of time to ask how long the wait is so you don't end up waiting for 2 hours for a table.  If it's your first time trying kbbq, you won't be disappointed trying out Gen.",

She was so prompt with our orders and refills for our drinks.  Location: At the mall. Plenty of parking (parking lot). Easy access and easy to find.  Food: Beef tongue and the beef short plate was really good today. Brisket was so-so and it may be due to the flavor? We aren't sure on the reason why on that one. I wished they would give us more of the side dishes at one time so we don't have to keep asking for them.  Service: Really great, attentive.

Wanted to give our amazing server SHEA a big shout out! We came on a busy busy Sunday during the lunch rush and she gave us great service. Always checking with us and gave us recommendations on what to pick. I brought some first timers with me and she made their experience one to remember! Hopefully when ever we come, we'll have her!   Lunch M-F is $15.99 30 times Dinner + weekends $20.99 34 times   Ban-Chan is pretty good, usually Kim chee, Kim chee cucumbers, pickled Dikon/onions, sweet mash potatoes(similar to shoyu potatoes), & green salad. Would be nice if they had bean sprouts! Refills included.   My favorites: Galbisal - didn't realize this was Boneless kalbi until my 3rd visit Reg/Spicy Pork Bulgogi, garlic pork belly,  Shrimp, crispy rice stick, jap chae, squid, Beef Tongue!! -must have, if you just order it and let your party try it! They will just think it's yummy beef! Lychee Soju is seriously dangerous and should be drank! Mmmm Save room for their ice cream macaroons....$4, but worth it! Coffee is my pick.  Green tea is yummy too.",

Nothing about pricing, what to cook, how long to cook, or anything at all. Ordered food and after 20 minutes had nothing and he assumed it went to the other end of the table. Stephen made sure we got our food, helped us cook properly and made sure we were taken care of all night. All of our separate checks were just placed on the table and not even handed out. Rude and unprofessional as a server. Please bump Stephen up because he makes the customers feel happy and satisfied!",

    "text": "Somewhere in between 4 & 5 stars, but being a little generous here because I understand the stresses of working in a busy environment.  Went here around 7PM, & wasnt surprised to know that there would be at least an hour wait. It's dinner time at an AYCE location, no biggie. Once we were notified that a table was ready two dishes, a salad & noodle, were brought out as appetizers as well as 6 little sides arranged by the grill.   We ordered brisket, pork belly & premium steak to grill. We also ordered this panko breaded chicken & cheese with a dark sauce... I want to say it's similar to katsu, even the sauce. Also KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) that came with a creamy sesame? sauce, both were pretty good! Rice all around & of course we had to get more of the noodles.  Our server was a little busy & had to come back to the table multiple times when he could have made it with one trip.. but it was just simple things like refilling drinks or getting sauce. And at the end there was a mix-up with checks from our table & another table getting the wrong change. Because of those things, I gave 4 stars.  Maybe coming back at a less busy time (whenever that may be for dinner) it'll be a more seamless experience with the service. But the quality of the meats were great, & the food that is already prepared is hot & delicious! Can't want to go back!",

    "text": "From 5 stars after this experience we had to bring it down.  We very frequently visit Gen at Galleria Mall as it is a usual favorite of ours. However this time around I'm throughly disappointed that we had to wait 2hours to be seated. I understand that it can get busy. Although after seeing a bunch of other parties of different sizes from 4-6 people come in and get seated before us was beyond me. We had a party of 8 and was told that the wait would be 40-50 min. Upon finally getting seated after 2 hrs the food and server was great. Until the bill came out... We were initially told that since we waited 2 hours and we didn't get to sit with our whole party we wouldn't need to pay gratuity. Well the gratuity was charged. When it was brought to their attention that we were still charged they took it off but added 4 extra people to our bill which made it a party of 12... To us it seemed as if it was added on to make up for the gratuity they took off. Quite frankly we were a bit ticked off at this point. I mean did they think we were not going to notice?! How many other people has this happened to???? Don't get me wrong even if the gratuity was taken off we still took care of our server since he was amazing!",

    "text": "Came back here last month! There really is no waiting in Vegas/Henderson unlike in SoCal and in the Bay Area. Gen is still my all time favorite AYCE KBBQ (Although K-Elements in San Francisco may soon top that), and prices are damn cheap! Servers are friendly, decor is nice, has a very hip feel to the establishment. Banchan comes out as you're seated, and they have a very good salad dressing. They haven't done this before at any of my previous visits to any Gen locations, but they now have a Japchae ready from the start, so I don't have to order it. Soft tofu soup has gotten a lot better compared to the last several times I have ordered it. It actually has some flavor now. Most meat seems to be pretty decent quality, and flavorful. They have a huge selection of meats! I have tried the appetizers on occasion too, but I think you can pass for the most part. The thing that puts everything together is definitely the sesame oil dip/sauce. I don't know what they do differently from other KBBQ places, but this one has a little bit of sweetness and saltiness that works with all of their meats. Prime steak is nice and juicy, kalbi is good but wish they brought out more on one plate. Most of their pork belly taste the same to me. They have the down draft system here, so your clothes won't smell like crap after and you can still go out! I know Sura BBQ is in Chinatown and the kalbi is pretty good too, but I'd rather not smell like charred food after I eat. At $20.99 for dinner, I'll be coming to the Gen in Henderson when I'm around and avoid the 2hr long waits that I have in the Bay Area.",

The lady was about to seat us totally totally in the corner next to a seat two other people were next to and I felt it'd be awkward since the whole row was literally empty and sitting next to these people in the corner would be a really awkward dinner hearing both groups conversations so I asked the lady to be seated somewhere on the empty row and she seats us on the other end next to where they put all the dirty grills since supposedly a 6 person party was supposed to sit next to us (but they never even showed up until closing!) anyways. Our server was Eugene and he had probably the best customer service than anywhere I've ever been! He constantly made sure we had napkins, sesame oil, orders in, grills changed, and etc. basically his customer service totally made up for the host trying to put us in the horrible corner. Now The food, the meat all tastes like way better quality than honey pig, or even some of the korean BBQ on the southwest side of Vegas. I didn't get really bad indigestion from eating here versus any other korean restaurant. The only thing that's possibly different is their sesame oil, it doesn't taste that great with my pork belly versus other places, and their spicy tofu soup lacks a bit of authenticity but other than that; they also have Cajun shrimps you can grill and a huge variety of meat selections I mean so it makes up for it. I'd give this place a solid 4 stars but our server Eugene was so awesome I have to give 5 stars. I'd def recommend or probably bring all my friends here if we have time to drive across town",

She has been to places like this in the past but on this trip she just was not happy with the idea of this style of dining. Our server, Alodia, was just so kind and patient about the entire experience. A lot of establishments tend to make my mom uncomfortable in these types of situations but Alodia and Gen went out of their way to accommodate us and make sure we still had a great experience even during a stressful time. Even had the food been terrible, I would be back based of the service alone. Thanks!",

Las Vegas can finally say it has a place locals can enjoy without waking thru a smoked filled casino and getting ripped off for small portions of meat and bad service.  The atmosphere was 5 stars.  The staff all worked together including management to make sure guest satisfaction is kept at the highest level possible. Everyone smiled and wanted to assist you in anyway possible.  Cooking your own dinner at the table has never been so much fun.  Anyone going on a first date this is the place.  Paleo dieters paradise.  The menu is massive and portion sizes are extremely generous.",

It has a modern, industrial feel to it.  The hostess who greeted us wasn't really friendly but our server Mizzo made up for it. He was attentive even though it got really busy for dinner.   Tips for anyone wanting to try out this place:  1. Make sure you're very hungry! This place is an all you can eat place.  2. Make sure you finish all your food or else you'll get charged extra.  3. If you order anything chicken, just know it takes awhile for you to cook!",

I personally won't be coming back to this location again. They should put a sign outside stating its not all you can eat meat and time is limited! Not only that we paid. $189 and we didn't even get enough of meat is it wasn't worth it!",

I mean all you can eat Korean BBQ can't ever go wrong. Also the fact that this place is classy and had great service sets Gen above the rest. We had a long wait for good reason, a ten person party, which is the max for a table. We spent our 45 minute wait at the bar and enjoyed the wonderful flavors of soju. Once we were sat they brought us salad and sides. We ordered almost everything on the menu.  I liked it all but recommended you order the red wine marinated pork belly and the tung. I know the tung sounds out there but if you like the brisket you'll love the tung. At the end of our meal happy hour started (9:30-10:00) and we made sure to finish the night with the remaining soju flavors. But if I haven't made my point and the bottom line of this post is that Terry is the best ever.",

All the other ones give me memories of flies and dirty tables. This one does not. Their alcoholic drinks are nice, had me all giggly.  I do hate how fries are on their menu and every time I've gone there they have not had it. Also, NO dessert...what? Nothing at all? Another thing I did not like was how service each time has been all over the place, with people taking orders and then forgetting food. This happened each of the 5 times I have been there. But, as I mentioned before, this is the cleanest and nicest looking Korean BBQ you will find here, so I'm torn.",

I politely told the hostess that greater us that we would come back later.  My wife and I are bqoth in the industry.

Everything is seasoned well and the glass noodles, while they look like worms, are delightfully savory and delish. The service is hit and miss. When they first opened, I had exceptional service twice, since then, not so much.  A few weekends ago I took my brother and his GF here for lunch, Sunday is dinner prices all day. No problem there, it's still a good deal with the amount of meat you can order. However, it was hot. Like the temperature inside the building was so hot. It was a hot day and I was hoping the restaurant would be cool, but nope. And we didn't get prompt water refills. We had to ask multiple times for dishes and grill changes.  I can forgive all things except the lack of water refills. If you can't quite get the place cooled off, I get it. If you are short on clean grills, I get it. But, leave a carafe of water for the table if you are prone to forgetting. Leave more than one carafe if it's hot as balls and your table keeps asking for water. We are dying, mister! I will be back again though. The food is too good to hold the heat against them for long. I'm hoping they get the air conditioning sorted out and that they can get the staff up to its former glory. If they can do that, it would be 5 stars. Yeah. Meat. It's good.",

I'm also a variety kind of guy, so I like all the options of meats, and their appetizers are definitely top notch. What does lack short though is the taste of the meats, some of the meats lack flavor, if they even have any.  As far as the atmosphere of the restaurant, I think it is very modernized in comparison to other Korean BBQs in town. The vibe is nice, background music is great, there's sports playing on a giant projector. Very fun to come in and just have a good time with friends. Overall I come here about every two weeks or so just because it's so close to me and I'm in the mood for some Korean BBQ.",

They do have long lines though but they have a good app to track your place in line so you can wonder around mall while waiting.",

    "text": "As others have previously mentioned, this is probably the most Americanized Korean BBQ restaurant you will ever find here in Vegas. It's also part of a chain, but do not let that detract you from coming here as this is one of those cases where the quality comes in stark contrast from its low price of 14.95-lunch and 19.95-dinner (that's WTF-cheap).    Sadly enough, I was very disappointed to find that they did not serve fish cake as part of their banchan. Unlike my significant other, I'm not a HUGE fan of Korean BBQ, but I do love my fish cakes. I always order 5 servings every time I go to one.   What I found very unique was their large selection of BBQ in comparison to other BBQ places. I believe  there's 32 options, including some, but not all of the appetizers. The only thing I'm disappointed about in their selection is that they don't have steamed egg. I feel like that's an absolute must AND classic anywhere you go!  My favorite meats (and we tried everything) at this location include the premium beef tongue, red wine pork belly, and the Gen chadol. I was particularly surprised to see the red wine, as that was an option that I have never seen at all at an AYCE before, and it tasted quite savory if you ask me.   Don't come here for the appetizers even though the large amount may tempt you. Save your room for the meats as the appetizers are skip-worthy IMO.   When you come, be prepared to completely serve yourself. Nobody's cutting your meat into bite-sizes for you or starting you off with grilling the first order. You get a scissors and some tongs and you are off on your own. I thought that was the fun part if you ask me, because I absolutely hate it when the servers do it for me. I feel it detracts from the experience.   A solid AYCE BBQ place for an extremely competitive price. It's far from my area, but I really can't ask for anything more.",

I was expecting to cook it but once it was placed in front of me it took me back haha.   Our hostess was very helpful and knew the menus back and forth. We were given suggestions and tips. The only thing I regret getting is the baby octopus. I didn't like the texture and should have stuck with the shrimp lol.   Sadly my husband doesn't want to go back but ifs tine wants to go with me I'm happy to join. The macarons were delicious as well.  We got the all you can eat for 19.99 and we got: steak, brisket, Cajun shrimp, marinated chicken, rice, and so type of delicious noodles. It was a great experience and I hope to go again!",

FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS: First off, I am an extreme shrimp fanatic. So I highly recommend the Cajun Shrimp!  I also love their spicy pork belly. BUT, the spicy pork belly comes in big portion! They're super thick. Also, I recommend their Gyoza & Volcano Chicken if you like something spicy with a big kick!",

The menu is AYCE and about $16 lunch /$20 dinner (weekends are dinner price all day) and has a wide selection of beef, pork, chicken, and seafood. The food is fresh and comes with a selection of more traditional(ish) sides like pickles, radish, and kimchi. The service is fast and friendly - with a special shout out to Ozzy - who made us feel welcomed and made some great reccomendations. The only reservation I still have is that the cold sides are placed on the tables ahead of time.

We ate our usual but my son didn't eat per usual cause it's not his type of food. He's always been free in our other trips but this time they charge him $9.99 and he didn't even take a bite of anything. I read the menu and it said 40 inch and under I guess he grew since then lol. But my husband went and told the front about the situation and she kindly remove the fee but now we know that our son is too big to be free it was actually only 1/2 inch from the free lol. So now since he isn't free I doubt we will be going there with him unless we don't have him around then maybe yes but otherwise we will be going to an a la carte type of place cause I don't even eat that much for all you can eat anyways. Overall the place is a deal but their prices did go up. For a person who can eat a lot it's a deal and the food is good for the price.",

However because of the vast amount of servers they got our orders wrong a few times and ended up having to ask them to take it back or that we didn't get something.

Limited banchan, side dishes. You get 4. That's it. They call them \"seasonal\" but I call it lazy. 4. The spicy tofu soup took over an hour to make and served. 5. Service was pleasant but slow.

I was a bit disappointed by the food. My sister commented that the meats tasted rather Americanized and I'm inclined to agree. I always get favorites like beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi at other Korean restaurants but when we got the food, it just didn't taste right. It tasted overly sweet and the charcoal flavor wasn't really there. The Korean fried chicken ended up being like this weird sesame chicken.  However, surprise hits were the beef brisket and the beef tongue. Both meats were sliced very thin and cooked really fast. The flavors here were nice, and we kept on ordering multiple orders of beef brisket.  The mashed potatoes were really good. The potatoes were slightly sweet (probably due to apple) and had some corn. We had multiple orders of this dish.  The grill we had was really weird. Despite using a lot of oil, the grills kept sticking. Maybe the heat was on too high? Maybe the grills were bad? Combination of both? We had to get the grill changed out like five times.  Also initially the service was really strange. Our server seemed disinterested and almost hesitant on getting us orders of food. Later on she lightened up and was more friendly about it, but the relationship started out strangely.  Anyway, this place is okay, a lot of the meats tasted funny, but there were some good hits.",

    "text": "It was a dark and stormy night. Bolts of lightning were streaking across the sky. Grey clouds rumbled by threatening to dump floods of epic proportions down upon the slickened streets. It was a Friday.  My friend was having her birthday so her and her kids jumped into my Dodge Ram limousine and headed south to Gen Korean BBQ, located in the Galleria Mall off Sunset. As we arrived, the combination of the weather along with the Great American Foodie Fest across the street made us think that grabbing a table would be no problem. How wrong we were. It was a 45 minute wait at 6:45pm. The restaurant was filled with groups and groups of asian people. There were asian people flowing out the door onto the sidewalk. All for $19.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ. I was both impressed and thinking this was going to be great.  A text message summoned us to a table set for 5, in a comfortable booth with a low set grilling device built in to the table. An appetizer of edaname, and seaweed salad accompanied the already served small dishes of various Korean appetizers like kim chi and others. A brief flurry of ordering steak, kalbi (not called that on the menu), pork bellies, roast beef, squid, baby octopus and others. They had some interesting variations on the pork belly like smoked garlic (ordered) and miso flavored.   A tower of Widmer Hefeweizen and a few carafes of Soju got the party started. Lots of cooking and soon plates were filled with various meats. Unfortunately for me, none of it had any flavor, it was very bland and basic. A small dish with salt/pepper mix and a few drips of a liquid flavor were also given to each diner, but this wasn't going to offset the bland flavors.  Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I would come back because the food was just blah. Service was hectic, but when you ordered it came out from the kitchen fast. The table was barely large enough to hold all the plates and drinks. There are other Korean BBQ places that place an emphasis on flavor. This place is popular because you can eat a lot of food for $20.",

Jaenica (I think that's her name) was an excellent server and very friendly and serviced us well especially me haha.   Will come back again but probably only when I'm in Henderson. This place is out there in like the boondocks  Ok now that I had time to digest the slaughter, let's take a look at this subjectively..  Tofu hut is 14 for late night and 18 for reg. sura is like 23. sura is the worst. I would not go back on my own accord. Very small selection and unappetizing presentation. Tofu hut is limited but convenient and had beef tongue which is my favorite. But tofu hut is busy, very greasy, and I leave there smelling like Korean BBQ...  Now to Gen. I was super Impressed. I wanted to order the dinner for lunch and pay 20 bucks but the people I was with didn't want that. The lunch special for 15 bucks is amazing value.   For starters their pan chan (side dishes) was great. Also all appetizers were included in the ayce price and included miso soup, sesame chicken (more like a karaage chicken), popcorn shrimp, and pork cutlet, gyoza, and many more. Already I was impressed with this.   Now on to the meats!!! Many different meat selections, a few chicken choices which is rare cause most Korean BBQ has only one. The #1 item on their list is actually a whole steak. We ordered 3 of those. They had 3 different kinds of bulgogi. Not my favorite in general but it kept my white man friends happy which is good.   Also the grill was designed like a gyukaku or Japanese style BBQ where the it was below the table a bit and holes around the grill sucked up the smoke so the restaurant was not smokey at all and your clothes are smelling like clothes still and not like ur slaving away in the kitchen.   Now the service. I had an Asian guy come up to help us 3-4 times, a one republic boy band waiter help us 3-4 times, and also jaenica who was super friendly and works three jobs come and help us about 4-5 times. So even though I like to talk to friends during this time and don't like to be bothered much, I felt the service for the general population as a whole would find this place outstanding.   Cons-  This restaurant is in Henderson, Arizona almost next to Phoenix. And I wouldn't recommend going and expect to sit more than 5 people on one table. I would recommend 3-4 people or 5 people with two of the, being petite women.   Other than that, A+ rating for value and gets the Michelin-Fuks 3star rating",

    "text": "Opening day at GEN- long awaited while the mall built out- and finally here!  Worth waiting for, and worth coming on the opening night.  Didn't seem to have any teething issues with the service, no confusion etc typically associated with an opening- everything was spot on.  The price:  19.99 per person AYCE, a bargain for LV, as all of the other places in town are a few $ more.  The ambience:  Not a normal AYCE BBQ place- more of a laid back modern vibe with nice decor, music, and lights. Almost like a bar with cozy white leather booths, huge tv, and great view of the mountains.  The food:  32 choices for the AYCE- a lot of different marinated beef choices, chicken and pork.  Tonight had the #1Gen Signature steak (Not recommended- chewy and no flavour), #3 Gen Chadoi (Highly Recommended- very very tasty), #5 Gen Beef Bulgogi (very good also- nice marinade flavour), #14 Cajun Chicken (Nice sauce, spicy and deep flavoured), #17 Smoked Garlic Pork Belly, and #32 Miso Soup (Very rich and good Miso base).  It comes with the usually side dishes which were laid out before getting to the table, so they were not fresh- they should be brought out after you sit down, they were mostly left untouched because either hard or a bit dryer out.    The salad and Jap Chae glass noodles were constantly refilled because they were eaten so quickly.  The grill is nice, it doesn't smoke upwards, the venting pulls it down, and you can't hear it at all, and doesn't leave the typical grease spatters on the table.  Changing the grill was done frequently, but the guys doing it simply picked up the old *hot & oiled* grill and run off with it.  No cart, no tray, no towel, nothing.  I wonder how long until someone burns themselves or slips on the oil dripping from it.  Opening day glitch maybe...    Easy payment, swiped at the table with a square, and ready to go.  Definitely coming back here- and skipping all the other Korean BBQ in town at this point- all the rest are overpriced, dirty and random.  Thank you for coming to LV, GEN!!!",

    "text": "GEN Korean BBQ (ayce) is no stranger to the Korean BBQ market, nor it's following fanatics of the grill galore at your table top and turns even the most decent mild manner human being into FEASTMODE. With several locations, well established in California (mainly so-cal), GEN brings the flavor to Southern Nevada in the city of Henderson (basically Las Vegas) but to be politically correct..it is in Henderson & situated in the Galleria Mall main entrance along side other restaurants.  I do compliment the fact that Gen provided an outdoor menu located by the entrance pathway for those not familiar with the delicacy or those just curious of what will be served...of course alongside prices.  This does give the opportunity for the customer, the option to decide whether or not they want to eat here without stepping inside, only to walk out in slight embarrassment...depending on one's personality.  (This could be a good thing or bad thing for GEN) I decide it is a good thing for me as a customer and to know what is expected.  Since the restaurant is located in a high traffic shopping mall, parking can be a hassle, especially at peak hours.  Wife and I arrived at an off time, around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Booths were in full use with a couple of hungry patrons before us waiting to be seated. We were given the option to be seated advanced with an open area at the high tables (somewhat like a bar area with high chairs) but we opted to wait an additional 30 minutes for a more comfortable and intimate booth. I do applaud the host for recognizing the option as others not willing to wait...would be able to jump on it.  Low & behold, our 30 minute wait turned into a quick 15 minutes as we noticed the patrons before us, being seated in timely fashion.   ***** Please note that peers and colleagues have noted that waiting time can be very long especially at peak hours...so we got lucky.   Weekend price was fixed all day to a reasonable $19.99 considering it was a dinner price & everything on the menu was available. If you are looking for a cheaper price & time permits, definitely come in during the weekdays during lunch hours, but do caution limited menu items for ayce.  Ambience was very modern & contemporary...very different compared to the casual and Asian feel of the usual Korean BBQ places here in Vegas and Chinatown area anyways. It had a feel to somewhat being in a VIP night club to an expensive gourmet restaurant. Background music was mild in sound, but could have been drowned out caused by Noise level chatter. It was some what loud, but not as bad as a Chinese Dimsum restaurant I won't name since I am not reviewing it.   Upon being seated, our hosts & servers were on point & seemed to check back frequent for more food order requests, taking empty dishes away & making sure our experience was on par. Menu choices were a-plenty in variety which I appreciated & even included appetizers to the ayce menu. Some of their portions per order were on the smaller side, but since it was ayce...it didn't matter, because you could request more & more until your heart desires...or until your stomach can FeastMode no more.   I was disappointed in the brisket, being bland compared to other kbbq joints. Their dipping sauce was limited as well as the seasoning & oils. I cannot complain on that area though, because I did not ask to see if they had any hidden in the kitchen.   Over all my experience was definitely on par & did fill me and my wifey's Tum~Tum to the brim. I do knock off one star as I have tried many kbbq joints...4 stars is being generous...as taste was mediocre and comparable but not better than cheaper china town locations. Again variety, service & ambience gave a very slight edge, but not by much.   I think the real winners here are the Henderson locals who do not have to drive out to Chinatown to get their K-Fix. As for me living in Summerlin it is quite a drive, so I do not see myself coming back anytime soon, as other competition are much closer. This does not mean I won't come back. Vegas is small so even a drive out to Henderson isn't that bad compared to California standards. Am willing to give it another go if I am in the area or bringing others out to try it.   I think Gen did a good job, & it's always nice to have another option to go to. It gets my approval and recommendations to try and check out...so if you are in the area...check it out too!",

Was seated within the minute and had our appetizer order taken care of by Ozzy. He was very thorough in explaining the menu and how everything works. Ozzy was friendly but this review is mainly for our server Luis and his impeccable service. There was not a moment missed where Luis did not read our body language or mind when we had a question or wanted to put in an order. The absolute most polite young gentleman I've ever encountered as a waiter. Drinks were never empty, grill plate was changed frequently, orders were put in efficiently, all with a smile and the friendliest demeanor possible.   Food was distributed in the most efficient and timely matter as well. The food was quite delicious and in reasonable portions per order. My personal fave: Beef bulgogi and the Korean fried chicken. My boyfriend enjoyed the beef brisket slices too. If you have space, try the macaron ice cream as well, green tea was yummy! Definitely recommending this establishment, and if you're lucky, Luis will grace you with his humble and sweet service.   Seattle salutes you Luis + Gen Korean BBQ!",

It's a 20-30 minute ride from where I live, but that's a good thing or else I'd be going here everyday!   As usual, I order lots and lots of briskets!!! That's my ultimate favorite, pork belly and kalbi come next. I love that this place has other appetizers as well, squid legs being my favorite. But like I said briskets + mashed potato is the best thing ever. Oh may I add that I like to dip this with the sesame oil with salt instead of just the salt.  Per usual, the experience is great. My last visit was tip top, thanks to ALODIA. It wasn't too busy that time, we just missed the lunch price! She came back to our table a few times to constantly check if we were doing okay. I don't really ask for much in service as long as my food is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> but since we have so many plates of meat all at once, our table was always clear of plates we don't use. Over all, it's always great here at GEN and no doubt we'll be back.",

It was cool to not only go someplace we haven't been, but also have them experience it too. Thanks mom!   Wait for tables weren't too bad, maybe 15 minutes. Unfortunately we had to be split up. Some say at the higher table while the rest of us were at the booth. Little kids must be at the booth. It can be a little challenging because there isn't too much space, plus when you're trying to cook and hold them at the same time..   Lunch price isn't valid on the weekends. That was a bit of a bummer, but we were sure to eat up!   Service is prompt and friendly. You get your drinks fast and they're on it with refills. Ordering is simple they have a device that puts in your order, so you get your food fast.   Some of the foods are already cooked... Think it was all the fried stuff.   Can't wait to go back again!

I loved the garlic chicken with the jalapeno cheese sauce and the brisket!   Our service did not start off great with a server who knew she was going to be off shortly after we were seated. I usually feel my dining experience starts off with the server. She did not seem happy to be there and when we asked her for something it seemed to be a bother to her. The server that took over for her was 100% better named Ozzy. Ozzy was enthusiastic and very nice to make sure we have a wonderful dining experience. He made great recommendations to try and definitely convinced us to come back in the future.  I am glad Henderson has a place like this now. Great ambiance and great food! Look forward to coming back. :0)",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I eat AYCE A LOT. Like once a week a lot. Like sometimes twice a week a lot.   Gen has been on my radar for a few weeks now and I did I enjoy my dinner there this week. I have to admit that it was more for the experience and the great service standards they keep that made me enjoy it. The food ended up being very average. Is it a contender for a go-to Korean BBQ spot? They did have a lot of pluses, but in short, no. I'd describe this as KBBQ for the masses like Olive Garden to Italian food. At $15 for their lunch menu and $20 for their dinner menu the price is pretty average for Las Vegas.  I'm going to assume everyone understands AYCE Korean BBQ: you cook your own meat on a grill and eat the meats with a variety of mostly pickled side dishes.  Gen is in a beautiful space outside of the re-vamped Galleria Mall. There is no entrance to and from the mall through the restaurant. The servers and hosts use a tablet to check you in, place orders, and ring up your meal. This made the meal enjoyable as the tablet sends tickets to the kitchen in real time. That means that food is coming to your table before your whole order is taken.  The restaurant has a lot of open and shared seating to accommodate small parties and large parties if necessary. I think one of the high counters can seat 12 people on 3 grills or 3 groups of 4 on those same grills. It was so annoying to me that nothing separated some tables because figuring out who gets what space. Also the staff would bring stuff and I wouldn't know who it was for: us or them. They seemed annoyed that I kept asking if the food was ours or theirs lol.  They boast a 30+ item menu which is completely AYCE. They have appetizers like chicken karage and fried spicy squid tentacles that set them apart. KBBQ can get boring even if you love meat. Having fried appetizers really add something to the meal that satisfies my taste buds. With that being said, most of the appetizers were just okay. We tried the agedashi tofu, fried chicken, KFC chicken, sea weed salad, squid tentacles, gyoza. Everything was a-okay, but nothing stand out, nothing special, and nothing I'd order all night.   The seafood proteins they offer like whole shrimp, baby octopus, and squid are unique to me and were my favorite part of the meal. The spicy shrimp was very good! Flavorful and spicy. The garlic squid was also good- tender and flavorful.  Out of all of their sides the one I liked most was their salad. Their dressing was very good and I asked for refills a couple of times. Their spicy tofu soup was also good. A lot of tofu and the perfect amount of spice.   Now that the good is out of the way here comes the down side.  Although the list of meats they offer was extensive, none of them were anything special. There was nothing I'd order a second time. We probably ordered everything and I found their meats to be some what off. Average quality? Or maybe just not what I'm used to. The end of all of their pork belly meats were cute way too thin. They all had a hard rubbery cap too that was almost plastic-y. I also commend their \"signature steak\" to be a nice offering but it was just boring and bland. Their short ribs were also a miss.   The meats I thought were okay: red mine marinated pork belly and of course the shrimp and squid.  I did enjoy my experience at Gen. I like what they're doing by introducing Korean BBQ to the masses outside of China Town. Im pretty sure it's a chain as I've seen friends in other states post about it. My highlights for this place was the great service, the \"ambience\", and the variety in their menu. With their pretty big seafood selection I'm sure anyone can find something to eat here.   I did make It a point to try the meats I was interested in as I concluded I probably won't go back. I give it four stars because I feel like I just personally didn't like it. There wasn't anything BAD that happened and there wasn't any BAD food I just didn't like the food as much as I like other KBBQ places. They did have a few service missteps like forgetting things and then never coming back at the end.",

Their menus show some items they don't have as well, like macaroons. I guess maybe they could be waiting to introduce their desserts after their staff is more established?",

The meat was good I didn't see any bad meat or anything, the waiter was quick at giving us refills on the banchan. The japchae and the gyoza were out of this world. I highly suggest 5 orders or more of beef tongue. Intestine while kinda awkward to cook is amazing. They had this new thing where it was pickled radish slices and you could use it to wrap your meat instead of using the lettuce which was really good too. I would definitely come back to this place.",

We did not mind because they have such a huge selection that it really satisfied both of our palates albeit being very different! It's honestly the best kbbq in town. I am also one for service and our server, Seong, made the experience all the more pleasant! He was so attentive and quick.

I guess it was a good thing because it died down a bit but we also went a little bit later at night and were told we beat the dinner rush. When we entered we were seated right away. I didn't like the fact most of the tables were already set with banchan on the tables. I know they're prepared in advance but I don't like the fact they're set out In advance. Ambiance has a club type of interior with a bar and high tables on one side and booths on the other side. I was actually impressed at the service. They had adequate staff and we were checked on multiple times not just from our server but others as well. I liked most of the meats we tried. Rib eye was an obvious choice but they also had garlic chicken with fondue. Not quite garlicky, the chicken didn't have much flavor and the cheese was more like nacho cheese from a can. For the price point the meats were pretty good and I like the fact you can order appetizers as well but was surprised there was no steamed egg. I don't mind because I don't eat the steamed egg but my other half lives steamed egg. Solid KBBQ not the best or worst. Tofu hut is still my fav even though it's not everyone else's first choice I would choose that place over and and again. This being closest to me I'd still rather go to Tofu Hut or DJK.",

The side dishes next to our table were sitting there for an hour!! And the meat is mygod so fucking bland. The GARLIC belly tasted like ham not garlic. WAT DAFUQ. Worst kbbq experience ever. If you want real kbbq thats good go to the strip right next to walgreens is ginseng kbbq. Im not sponsored or some sht. They have real korean aunties who will help while u cook ur meat. And the meat is waay better there",

    "text": "I am genuinely happy that Gen opened up in Henderson at the Galleria mall. For the last year (and for the next 6 months only! I'm counting down the days!) I've been living and going to school in this area. All the Vegas Korean BBQ places are clear on the other side of town and I'm never usually in that area. Pretty much the only time I ate kbbq was when I went home to LA. So I'm really glad that one opened up here because it is going to be my default kbbq spot simply because of the proximity.  That being said, I am extremely familiar with Gen and have dined at multiple locations. It is honestly my default kbbq spot back home too since they have one in Torrance, CA and I don't have to drive all the way to Koreatown. Compared to the California locations I've tried, this place really isn't that great. It's okay for what it is, but it could be better.  One thing to keep in mind is that Gen is not your traditional kbbq restaurant. It is more Americanized/modernized. This is reflected in the decor, which is very \"nightclub\"-y. There are also no hood vents, as the ventilation system is under the table/surrounding the grill. There are also no traditional staples of kbbq such as steamed egg and Korean pancake (which I love and wish Gen would offer). There are Americanized appetizers such as cajun fries. Actually, the appetizer thing is new to this location if I remember correctly. They do not offer rice paper at this location, and you can only order 4 meats/apps at a time.  The service is pretty bad. I have been here 3 times so far and I've had to search for our waiter every time. It's too bad I don't remember the names of the waiters. The first one was the only slightly decent experience as he was on point with service up until the end, when it was time for us to get our bill and there was no one around for like 20 minutes. It really sucks to have finished all the meat you cooked, without being checked on by anyone, and wait for 10-15 minutes before someone finally shows up and asks if you want to order more meat. Bad service isn't really localized to the Henderson location though, it is a complaint I can make of most Gen locations in California. They really needs to implement the button system that traditional kbbq restaurants have.  The table ventilation system can be a big issue. I haven't had too many problems at this location with it, but the flame in the grill can and will go out, causing you to have to find someone to light it again. One time we went, the couple next to us had to have theirs relit 3 times within what was probably a 10 minute period. If that happened to me, I would be really annoyed.  The Gens in CA offer macaron ice cream sandwiches as a dessert (not as part of the menu, you go up to the little freezer by the host stand and pay for one there), but this one does not have that, which is really disappointing.  As for whether or not it's the best kbbq in Vegas, I can't really say. I do genuinely enjoy the meat and the marinade flavor. The spicy pork bulgogi is one of my favorite things of all time. However, this location serves much smaller portions than the California locations do, and I don't know why. It's not that big of a deal for me as I usually go to eat here with my boyfriend only, but considering the 4-at-a-time rule, if you're trying to eat here in a large group some of you won't get to eat. Or you'll all eat really teeny tiny portions, like one slice of brisket per person.  A final note to my unnecessarily long review, because this really rubbed me the wrong way... The first two times I dined here, the waiter informed us of a promotion they were having for their grand opening. If you wrote a Yelp review on your phone before getting your bill and named your server, you would get your drinks on the house. I feel like this is SUPER SHADY. First off, I write too much (as evidenced by this very review) and I would feel way too pressured to do it while sitting at the table. I mean, do I just sit in the table occupying it after I'm done eating and write my review for 20 minutes? Or am I supposed to do it a quick one-sentence, five-star review like Gervin D.? Secondly, I wasn't told to put 5 stars, but if he was told to by his server, that's super uncool and shady. That actually makes me want to drop my review to 1 star. I'll think about it.",

So, I was really excited when I found out they opened up one in Las Vegas.   However, my visits here are always different. Sometimes the quality of the food is good and the service is good, but other times it's the other way around. Definitely nothing like the locations in California.   However, today's visit was excellent all because of our server Alodia. We came in with about a party of 16, and she carried such a warm and friendly demeanor throughout our entire stay. Most importantly, she was also very attentive- constantly checking up on both our tables and making sure we had everything we needed. Alan also did a great job with delivering our food, getting our grills changed and making sure we had what we needed as well.   Great job you guys! Keep it up!",

It is a first come first serve and your entire party needs to be present. Expect to wait for a while.  (20 min wait at 5:30pm for us) They did just open but the staff seem to be on it.  The only think they need to fix it the servers keep coming to the check in desk and this poor girl has to take names for a waiting list while splitting the check for customers and printing them out.   It's ayce for lunch and dinner.  Lunch is 14.95 for 29 items and dinner is 19.95 for 32 items.  We honestly only order the numbers 1 (steak) , 3 (brisket) , & 17 (garlic pork belly). You can only order 4 meats at a time. They do have appetizers as well and u can order as many of those  as you want.  Ask for garlic and jalapenos and sliced radish if you want.  They don't have the rice papers yet",

Customer Service: 3/5  - Everybody was very nice and smiley. The issue I had was that the restaurant was super busy, instead of the waiter coming around and checking up on us we had to wave down the waiter or ask the bus boy to get him for me. I think if the staff was more prepared for the volume of customers then the service would be better.  Food: 4/5  - The food here was bomb! We ate here with a Korean local that ordered all of our food for us and let me tell you I'm glad we had her. The meats where very well seasoned and the portions were perfect for sharing and trying out all the different items on their menu. My issue comes with the rice, the first batch we got seemed like it was a day old and cold, the second just didn't taste right.  Presentation: 3/5  - The stove top that his restaurant uses is a stick top, not a non-stick top. All the meats we cooked got stuck to the stove and we had to rip it off just to flip it, not cool.   Price:  5/5  - For the amount off food and the quality of the food I can't complain about the price. For lunch AYCE is 15$ and for night AYCE it's 20$. Not a bad price at all and very reasonable  Overall: 4/5   - I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant, my wife and I loved it. If you like Korean BBQ, and if you are a fan of AYCE this place is for you. Just be prepared to wait a little bit to get a seat because this place is alway packed.",

Also, their have same great tasty food as their sister stores in California.  This is bargain, there no place you can even compare in Nevada. Also, this place has some of fancy appetizers that are not included in California location.  So good. One more, this is not your average Asian Theme restaurant.

First of all we had to wait, we've waited for almost an hour to get a table, which my friends and I didn't mind because we knew that they just opened a couple weeks ago. However, when we were sat down we asked our horrible server Sam for water and if they had hot tea. The response he gave us, I've never heard in my life. He said that they didn't have hot tea because it was too hot outside. Now, is that how you inform customers that you don't have hot tea?! You refer to the weather?!?! & so I asked another waiter and she mention they weren't serving hot tea at the moment which sounds more professional then what the other waiter said. Anyways, the meat wasn't that great. Not the same quality as the one in LA. The servers were slow and they didn't even oil our pan until we asked them to. It was just disorganized. When it was time for us to pay the bill, 4 servers came to ask if we wanted our check and we mentioned that someone was already getting it for us. We didn't get our check after another 20 min and when it came they made a mistake on our bill and so we had to wait for another 10-15 min. I was so upset I wanted to speak with the manager. Instead of the manager coming over they sent the assistant manager while the actual manager sat back and just watched. Seriously, is that how you run a business?!?! My friends and I were soo disappointed. This was my favorite KBBQ until that day we went to this location. Never again. It was sooo horrible!",

    "text": "Not impressed! We walked in and waited almost a half hour to even get seated, after they said it would be 15 to 20 minutes. Then when we sit they tell us that on the weekends it's dinner prices only, we were somewhat okay with that, just wish it would be publicized somewhere. So we are about to order and now our server proceeds to tell us they are are out of half their appetizers/side dishes. If you want me to , pay full dinner price then don't be out of your supply, especially on a weekend; you need to be better prepared for a weekend and high demand! Not a first good impression! We were looking forward to a new restaurant at Galleria, don't think it will be an asset to the area unless they get their act together. Oh, and ALL hostesses (6) working at the front counter need nicer attitudes as they are the first person you meet when you walk in.  I think all you can eat sushi would be a better choice and money better spent.",

    "text": "Took the family here since we loved the Gen in Torrance California. We Went on a Tuesday night and still found a long line. Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works. Definitely won't be returning here.",

Let me start by saying that I read a negative review from a few days ago about the floors being sticky as if some one had spilled a drink.  Well, they are still sticky today.  Perhaps mopping isn't on their list of priorities.  Also, I did notice posted at the front by the hostess station that their rating by the Heath Department had been downgraded to a B but we decided to stick around and try it any way. Most of the meat is mediocre at best.  The only thing we would give a good rating is the smoked pork belly.  Additionally, the kitchen manager was unaccomodating.  We noticed there was a chicken dish with a cheese fondue.  We asked if we could have the cheese fondue with a different item but the manager said no.  Again later in our visit we requested only a half order of meat and were again told no that they we could only get a full order.  Honestly, those two reasons along with the mediocre meat quality marks this KBB off my list of any I would ever recommend or return to.",

They text you when your table is ready so me and my friends were able to walk around instead of just sitting down waiting for our name to be called. So that was appreciated. The service was awesome! Everyone we encountered was very friendly, informative & knowledgable about the menu. I was warned by a handful of people that the service was bad so that was what I was prepared for. It was a pleasant surprise for me. As we read the appetizer menu, our waiter informed us that they ran out of like 4 appetizers so we couldn't order it. Luckily we weren't planning to order those anyways & they still had the noodles we wanted! My 2 friends & I did AYCE. We ordered 2 of the briskets (number 3 I believe), some kind of bulgogi, & garlic pork belly. I feel like the brisket was too dry. I like Tofu hut's brisket better to be honest. My friends agreed with me on that one lol. My side of rice was a little dry. I didn't personally care for the pork belly but my friends said it was bomb. I liked the bulgogi. LOVED the noodles appetizer. It's called japchae or something like that lol. Anyways, yeah... It was okay. I'll probably give this place another chance later. It is still pretty new so there's lots of room for improvement. It has potential.",

The price point to this place is pretty good also! $20.xx per person for dinner, not sure if any different during lunch. Your entire party MUST be there before they seat you which is quite irritating if you ask me but whatever. Now, I've only gone here once (first time waited 20 minutes for a back to back table for a party of 8) because the second time I came the wait time was about 2 hours! And it was a Monday around 7:30pm! Food is on point, didn't care too much for the flavored sojus. We tried the lychee flavor and it tasted more like the lychee juice from the cans. Tried a lot of the meats on the menu and I especially liked the cow tongue. It wasn't too gamey like most places and the pork belly was super good. I loved that I didn't my smell too much like the food because the vents were also inside of the grill. Lots and lots of parking since it's located at the mall",

I personally like the pork belly and they have a few different options- garlic, miso, regular and more I didn't get to try. Lunch is priced at $14.99 and dinner at $19.99. If you like beef tongue, it's only available in the dinner menu. There's no desserts here but they have more side dishes you can choose from. I also like that they give you small portions at a time  so you don't overwhelm yourself. It's very new, clean and really good. I gave 4 stars because their gen signature premium steak tasted really bland- it was cooked right & texture was right but I'm pretty sure they forgot the flavor. Also saw some tables (booth) were 6 people are seated but it looked like there should only be for 4. They also have the high tables which is not okay if you're going with kids. Also, this place is much smaller to the one I went to in California so there might be a wait time unless you call for reservations. They recently opened so expect it to be busy. Don't hesitate to ask for more food since the servers all run around with their tablets & they place your order there and then. Other than that, I'll still be back for more .",

The rice cake is lightly fried which is *really* nice.  I and my co-conspirators went through practically half the menu and didn't find anything disappointing.  Surprise: they didn't have any hot tea available.  Missing: seafood pancake (haemul paejon) - it would be awesome to see what Gen's take is on this!    Fantastic service!  Banchan is waiting for you before you're seated.  Everything is done electronically which is pretty cool too.  Our guide Alodia was tha bomb! Patient, attentive, funny, friendly, and informative.

If you are a fan of pan chans(Korean side dishes). This isn't your place.  A great Korean restaurant is a smorgasbord of delightful side dishes so plentiful there is no room on the table for your entree... Here you get 4... You're also cooking yourself.  Which is great if you have experience cooking Korean food, if you don't... This Isn't for you.",

They don't even offer to put oil on you have to ask. The quality of meat is also subpar. My advice go to a different place for all you can eat. My favorite is honey pig.",

The shrimp tasted like mud with a lingering after taste.  I guess you suppose to drenched them in a sauce before you eat them. The service was less than OK.  Waiters forgetting our orders and never came back to check on water until we asked.  We had to go to the cashier to pay our bill because the waiter never came back with the bill when we asked.

I told the waitress that it was our first time there  2. she offers the lunch box or the ayce  3. we chose the ayce 4. we had a little bit of raw meat left and a little bit of fully cooked meat left 5. asked the waitress for a box, she said she'd bring one but we would have to pay $5 extra for the uncooked meat Ok fine. I understand. waitress drops off the check.  paid. never see waitress. waiting. bus boy shows up. starts clearing everything off the table. request a to-go box again. he looks dumb founded. uhhh, we don't normally do that. ... waitress said she would bring us one. dumb look. lemme go ask her... waiting. waitress comes back and talks to me like I'M retarded. EVEN ASKS oh have you never been here before? I said I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN WE FIRST WALKED IN. Anyway, 3 other people heard her say she was coming w take home box and now she says we can't take home any food. so NOT ONLY did I pay $5 for food we didn't cook or get to eat, it's all going in the trash!! SERIOUSLY. what a waste of food!! and she LIED to my face when she first came to the table. But what really pissed me off the most was SHE SHOULD HAVE WARNED US IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE SAT DOWN ABOUT THE EXTRA CHARGE AND NO TAKE HOME! this was my first and LAST time eating here. so greatly disappointed ): two stars were for the atmosphere and food. otherwise, shitty service. 2 thumbs WAY WAY down.",

    "text": "I don't post reviews much unless I deem it necessary and this one is definitely necessary given my most recent dining experience. I have eaten here for the last time tonight after being a frequent customer for the past two years. (And for about 6 years prior to that when I lived in Cali).  Let me explain why.  1.)The menu has changed, and not in a good way.   No more rice paper..??  I've never in all my years ate at a \"Korean bbq\" that doesn't serve rice paper. It's part of the dining experience of Korean bbq. I was taken back by this as I found it appalling to say the least. I want to wrap my meaty treat in some carbs.   The salad went from basic diced romaine to this spring mix, and again never had this in any Korean bbq I've ever had.   They've basically taken the Korean out of kbbq, adding proteins slathered in sugar laden marinades as the \"star\" of the menu. They also included a \"Cajun\" marinade for the proteins as well. Still scratching my head on that one too.  Never known of Korean food to be Cajun inspired.   2.) The back of the house is awful  Every other time I've eaten here, even when busy the back of the house kicked ass at getting food out in a timely matter. Tonight, with the restaurant half empty, on a Wednesday night mind you, the food wasn't coming out quick enough to keep the grill loaded up.  I had to beg for a grill change.   I could add more to this but I'll end it here, but for 22 a head (up from 20 with a better, more authentic menu) my love with the consistency and quality that existed for years with this restaurant chain is over.  They've let the \"bean counters\" get in the way of how this company is run and have thoroughly ruined the experience. They've lost this customer for life and I'll be promptly looking for another kbbq restaurant to get my fix.",

Long story short, some manager was very rude to her and her coworkers and kept trying to rush them out even though there was barely anyone else there for lunch. Fortunately we didn't see that same manager. This time around, the staff were very welcoming and polite. Our waiter was a little slow even when it came to getting our check. The quality of the meats are average or even below average. The briskets, the staple of kbbq, don't taste that good without the brisket sauce. Three stars since they have good appetizers and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).",

I would try the KFC as a good started yummy  The meat quality is actually very good, for what you pay. Make sure you try dessert though and ask for Rich to be your waiter.",

    "text": "Gen is the perfect Korean BBQ spot for newbies (new to Korean food) because they offer a vast amount of traditional and unique beef cuts, and appetizers besides banchan.   Meat: They have a lot of different beef cuts and pork! LIKE A LOT PLUS SEAFOOD. Some of their items include: brisket, beef tongue, different types of marinated premium beef and pork, pork loin, shrimp, chicken, beef chunk flap, calamari, pork belly, and prime steak (top sirloin). My favorites are the beef brisket, beef tongue (trust me, it may seem weird but the texture is just a little chewier and doesn't get dry even if you accidentally over cook it), and prime steak. All my meats were juicy red and never frozen (places like Tofu Hut will give you the beef tongue with icicles on there).  Banchan: DISAPPOINTING. It really sucks here and they only have 4 items; cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi, a mashed potato-like item, and daikon. They don't have any of the  traditional items like soybean sprouts or pan-fried breaded fish. I guess their appetizers make up for it... They have a handful of items like spicy rice cake, jap chae, garlic chicken, edamame, etc. (No more seaweed salad starting July 2016). I recommend ordering rice paper, it's an off menu item and goes great with your meat (think of it as the tortilla to your beef/pork).   Service: It depends. Sometimes their service can be amazing, even on a busy day, but generally they seem understaffed and take forever to get food out.   Overall: I am satisfied and can't complain because they do offer a lot. Lunch is $14.95 a person, and dinner is $19.95 (which is cheaper than a lot of places like Hwaro for example). I wish the maroon ice creams were included but they aren't sadly. It's $3.95 each (mango, strawberry, vanilla, and green tea).",

Halfway through our meal, a clod of dust fell onto our table.  We look up and see a thick layer covering the walls.  We started looking around and this place looks like it hasn't received a thorough cleaning in years.  Isn't this a new building???  I'm really not too picky or one to complain to management, but this totally raised my disgust meter.  I decided to mention this cleanliness issue to the hostess as I walked out the door only to be met with a half-hearted,\"Oh really? Sorry.\"  No offer to tell a manager, no actual apology.  Well, thanks for raising my toddler's immune system.  Gross.  Needless to say, I can't see returning to this place.. too bad.",

They come around pretty frequently and also ask if you want the burner plate changed. Good service.   One star less bc seating arrangements didn't seem personal. There was just two of us and we were sat at a table with two other people that were only two feet away from us. It was pretty much just one table with two burners on each end.

    "text": "We usually go early (before 6pm) to ensure that we get a table and not be stuck in line.  We have been here about 4 time and it has improved each time - esp. the service.  Here is our breakdown:  1 - Environment.  Very spacious and plenty of room.  The seats are comfortable for parties of 6 or less.  For parties that are greater than 6, you most likely be sitting in separate tables.  If I recall, they have booth seating instead of individual table seating.  Overall, it is comfortable and nicely laid out.  I give this a solid 4.  2.  Service.  Like I said, service has improved each time.  We were here when they were opened a few months.  Let's say service was horrid.  However, they have gained more experience, quality of the servers have improved, and response time have dramatically changed for the better.  It went from a 1 star to about 3.5.  3.  Food.  I wish there were more side dishes.  However, there is still enough of a variety.  The quality of meat are average (you aren't going to a five star restaurant) but still very good.  We spend much of our time ordering Galbi, Bugolgi, and Beef tongue (very good by the way).  One of the things they could improve upon is to have a dessert menu as part of the AYCE.  We give this a solid 4 for the type of restaurant and variety of meats.  Overall, we enjoy dining here.  It is definitely one of our go to places for Korean BBQ in Las Vegas... esp.  AYCE!",

The first couples of times I've gone, service was a mess.  The burners would always go out because of the AC and we would have to be seated elsewhere after asking them to light the grill 5 times.  As of late, service has gotten a lot better!  Grills work well now and the food comes out in a timely manner.  They also offer rice paper now, but I'm still waiting for them to have steamed egg.  My favorites are beef tongue, pork belly, pork cheek, japchae,and their KFC.  They also bring out 4-5 different ban chan and salad that's unlimited.  If you're interested in dessert, they also offer ice cream macarons!",

LOVED It. Immediately ordered bulgogi, flat iron steak, and gen house steak. The meat was so tender and each one magnificent flavor. I ate my WEIGHT in steak. Our server, every time he came back, we ordered 2 orders each of more meat. We must've eaten at least 15 orders of flat iron and 20 of bulgogi. Also the lychee soju, was simply perfect. The perfect blend of flavors to where it was impossible to taste any type of liquor. At the end, we were stuffed and amazed by how much we ate and how little our check was. About $213 for 7 of us, tip included as well as a pitcher of soju. This is my new favorite and I'm already craving coming back!",

They did not tend to any of our needs, it took multiple waves for us to be noticed. Honestly, we only saw one person who was actually doing work and that's the guy who delivered the meat. The restaurant looked pretty overstaffed, maybe they need to focus on hiring people with experience first then I'll go ahead and give it one more shot.",

    "text": "My first review since I've been MIA and I have to say this isn't my favorite Korean BBQ AYCE. I've been to better ones near Chinatown where it's a tad bit pricier; however, quality was much better than GEN. GEN's looks may be nice but isn't really matched up for the type of restaurant they are hosting.  1) GEN's interior design is sadly better than the food. The food is dry, not well marinated, oily in some cases, small portioned, and monotoned.  2) There's no sprinklers in the ceilings so what happens if a Wanna-be-chef (like me) can't cook right and accidentally 'overcooks' their food and a catastrophe happened. Yes, I saw a fire extinguisher but it's far from being reached and being reasonably safe.  3) The overhead hood that collects the smoke wasn't present and should be on top of the grill. While I was eating, I was inhaling smoke like crazy and got sicker and sicker the more I stayed. I know some veteran restaurants have vents above grills to collect the smoke and suck it up instead of spreading around the restaurant.  4) Service was okay. Their communication was on point. Once me and my partner ordered more we got it in less than a minute because they use smart tablets to send it up to the kitchen. Now that's clever way of being precise and fast for the customers.  5) So many grill changes and it was driving me crazy. Of course I'm cooking more food yet they have the audacity to ask me if I want a grill change. The other restaurant automatically does it for us because why would we cook our food on a burnt grill? Common sense. Yes it's nice to ask but do it in a way where you have to change it rather than wanting a customer to keep a burnt grill where the burner is still running.   I would personally not be back here. They don't accept discover cards (sorry folks). They don't give you forks (unless they have some in stock- sorry for those who can't use chopsticks for their life (like me)). And the prices for drinks is higher than most restaurants and they do not have HOT WATER for hot tea. They only have soda and iced water. I can see potential in this restaurant but that's in the future. They're still in their opening phase and I can't blame them. But for the meantime, I'll keep this restaurant on my low priorty list.",

I went here with my girl to get the Hawaiian steak the LA locations have, unfortunately they did not have it at this location. Bummer but still hungry so lets go  Food 3/5 I had high expectation, unfortunately they were barely met. Quality was good especially on the marinated items but they did not come to par from the LA Locations. I would say the barely exceed the quality of tofu hut. Which for 5$ less i would definitely go to tofu hut.  Service 3.5/5 ...... This part is tricky, The waiters and staff were very friendly. Except we sat next to this couple and as they were paying out the host was making small talk and ASKED them if they knew what yelp was and asked them to write a good review with their servers name. Because they were having a competition. Well that definitely knocked me back. Em not opposed to the competition because that is good motivation for the team. BUT ASKING someone to write a good review and shout out the server. Very unprofessional. Had i not overheard this it would be a 5/5.  Store: 5/5 Brand new location clean everything, the grill i did not like i prefer stone grills because they tend to stay clean but that's my preference.  Ill be back once they are more seasoned and got they quality and prep down good.",

I understand the pressure on new businesses but today's visit was just totally insulting.   Party of 9 for my cousins bday & they quoted an hour wait & they'll text once the table is ready. No problem, we totally understand it would be long. An hour later, we ask if it'll be any longer. \"5 more minutes, just cleaning the table.\" This happened for another 45 mins. \"10 more minutes, just cleaning the table.\" Nothing yet. Finally, we were informed that there are two booths available back to back, is that okay, they ask. Yes, but.. you're telling me that for 45 minutes, you weren't really cleaning the damn table?! You were just bluffing?! Oh hell no. We got to the table and there's a booth side by side. We asked if we could have that instead so we could interact with each other. She had to ask management if that's okay. It's common sense so it better be! Sigh..  We were finally seated & got our orders in. Received our food and cooked them. Asked for the rice and they said it will be coming in 20 mins bc they ran out. Are you serious?! By the time the rice came, we already ate the food cause we were starving. We ordered some more and waited another 30 mins for those to eat with our already cold rice. Oh, and our waters only came 30 mins into our meal after asking them several times. That should've been the first things you give to customers.   Patience was running thin at this point because every single server we encountered had the nastiest attitudes. No smiles, no eye contact, slamming plates on the table..(except for one guy who tried to compensate for his co-workers' actions but it was too late). Really felt they did not want to be there at all and we were nuisances for ordering. It's AYCE isn't it?! You make us wait so long so.. hell yeah, we're hungry hippos now!   You can only split the check 3 times so we did. 3 different servers came by and kept asking how and it got old repeating what we were saying. We waited at our table for 30 more mins for our checks. We finally walked up to the counter and asked where our checks were. They said \"Ummmmm.. Well....\" Okay, got it.. This is how you want to end an already crappy dining experience. Good job.   Walked out of there & heard 5 other parties complaining about their experience.   So there, you've been warned. I usually give a 2nd chance for places but this place is not one of them. Cousin's bday ruined. Thanks Gen!",

For the past 8 years, I've been looking for a similar experience here on Vegas. Well, Gen Korean BBQ is definitely the place. First of all, the price of 19.99 for dinner is a steal for the quality of food. They have a wide range of meat/chicken/seafood selection. The brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly are all on point. The different seasonings for their pork belly were all excellent. Their side dishes and appetizers were all really good as well. My fiance and friend especially loved the rice cake. The salad is good, and they have rice paper!! That was a huge selling point for me. I got to have rice paper with my Korean BBQ. Bean paste was also great.  The service their was excellent. We were told the wait was 30-45 minutes, and was seated at about 41 minutes into our wait. Side dishes were already waiting for us when we sat down. We got our orders taken within 5 minutes, and even before we were finishing our first order, they were already bringing out our meat! Throughout our dining experience, the servers were quick to refill our drinks, take our orders, and brought our food within 2 minutes of ordering. We asked for a ton of rice paper and salad, and each time they were quick and accommodating. I cannot rave anymore about the great service we got.  I do wish there was a location closer to the southwest area, as the drive out to Henderson took about 30 minutes. But it is completely worth it. The wait looks like can be pretty long, as we did hear some people being quoted up to 90 minute wait time for seating. But in my opinion, if you can make the drive and wait, then you will be rewarded!  This is the Korean BBQ I've been looking for in Las Vegas. 5 stars Gen. 5 stars.   Right up there with oyster bar palace station, soho sushi, and tbones steakhouse.",

The quality of all the food makes the 19.99 price an extremely great value! The brisket (which was not frozen!), bulgogi, steak and pork belly were all top notch! To top it all off the ban chan was terrific and appetizers were included!   Perhaps what really sets this place apart from all the other KBBQ places in town is the decoration (feels like an upscale club unlike the outdated, slippery floors that plaque the other top spots in town) AND the service was FANTASTIC! Our server, Howard was very attentive and we never wanted for refills. That really seals the deal in comparison to the often empty, shallow service you get from other places in town.  5/5 would come again!   Noticeable bonus: the way the exhaust fans are set up (in the grill as opposed to overhead) make it so you don't leave smelling like meat! That's enough reason to make me want to come back!",

    "text": "Man don't believe the hype at all. Comparing this to their cali location they're worlds apart. Not saying that this is the worst kbbq in Vegas, but it's close to there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money here, there are much better kbbqs in Vegas.  Ew moment of the week: Went to the toilet stall as a WORKER was coming out. Go in to find toilet seat down with pee drops all over it.... BRUHHH WTFFF?! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AND THEN PEE. As if that wasn't bad enough he didn't even flush!!!!! PLEASE MAN MERCY.  I've been here three times with friends and family that wanted to try it out. And each time I've went here the same problem was always there.  I find it off putting that their speech is always the same is \"3 card max. split, 4 meat per order, leftover will be charged\" I came here to eat ayce bbq and have a good time, not a speech of \"here is what you can't do\" in a semi threatening tone.  Servers here are 0/5. They have a system where you don't have a dedicated server it's just a whole bunch of servers walking around. This creates the problem of zones specifically being left out. Many many times I saw tables next to me waiting forever to get an order in, when the other side of the room is swarming with severs dicking around. The servers seem to not have the intention of helping out too, they just walk around in circles and avoid areas waiting for their shift to be over. You really have to get their attention. Instead of them asking you if you need help with anything it's you that need to get their attention. It's very frustrating when you need a simple water refill or more potato salad.  Echoing off many of the reviews here. You can only place 4 orders of meat....imagine coming in with a group more than 5... So limited!!!!! The portions are teri-freaking-bad too. So tiny!!!!!!!!!!  Literally the only saving grace at the end was one server who kind of kept an eye out for us. Mizzo was his name! He made sure our orders we're coming through and apologized if it took a long time.   This place has a lot to improve on before I make it a daily.",

I feel the way they do things is modern compared to the rest of the Korean bbq places I've tried. The place is hip and cool. Music is mostly r&b which I like and just sets a nice vibe. Now onto the people in the front, sigh. This is where I have to say they have work to do. I've been here more times than I can count and 9 out of 10 it takes forever for the people to greet or say anything to those walking in. They are usually busy looking at each other discussing either non work related things or just mumbling away to each other about seating and what not. If the staff at the front of the house could be trained better and not be a hassle to get their attention that would be great. Now onto the food, I always do the same thing, Cajun shrimp, steak, and the amazing pork cutlet with cheese. These never disappoint and I will order to my hearts content. I've also come alone on occasion and find that gen let's you have a solo eater as many other Korean places won't do that so I appreciate that. Aside from this I think gen is my go to when driving to Chinatown is a hassle or I want a trendier place to eat!",

Okay, let start with the service, everyone that served us was nice but, please tell me why it took us 15 mins to get 2 glasses of ice water, she said it wasn't ready and that's why it taking so long. Our food came out faster then the water. We found out it was happy hour asked for the menu that took 10 mins and to order a alcoholic beverage we waited 15 mins on top of that. I ordered japchae along with our meal, never received it. I had to ask 3 times for radish skins, and when they finally came there was a green thick film on one of them I was told it was wasabi radish skins. But tell me why the kitchen didn't know or our waitress didn't know what it was, she informed me that her \"manager informed her it was wasabi radish skins\". Ordered the premium steak but it had such a thick layer of grizzle i didn't want to attempt to try to eat it. Everything else was okay.",

The bad part is they do not take reservations so you have to try and time it so you do not show up in a rush. We hit it just right on a Sunday night about 6:30. only had to wait about 10 min. The look is upscale modern. they have a few types of seating from high single chairs to reg booths. The staff is very friendly and do not seem to mind questions. Our waiter was more then eager to suggest items off the menu to get us started. And he was on point. I have to say i highly recommend #10 myself. The shrimp items are very flavorful but they are peal yourself with heads on so kinda put my son off a bit.. They do have a spicy soup I would recommend trying. we where never left wanting, orders where taken timely so we had a constant flow of food to the table but not staking up. All in all a wonderful experience.",

We literally had to remind our waiter more than 7 times for our appetizers and sides. If it was once then I wouldn't be as irritated but seriously more than  7 times ? Barely checked up on us even when we were ready for more meat with our menus in our hands. That's just ridiculous we spent most of our time waiting. When our waiter found the time to take our orders the people who brought out the food were great and made it out in great timing. I mean I get it ,it can be busy and hey the guy may be new. But I honestly don't think those are excuses on just our one little table. To be reminded on orders that many times as if he didn't have a little book to write it just seems to be a little unprofessional to me. Made our dinner very unpleasant.",

Half the appetizers were not available. No hot tea. What ??? For 20 bucks a head, you get tiny portions of whatever you order, and when you want to re-order, the waitstaff is nowhere to be found. For three of us, one order of brisket = 5 pieces. One order of kimchi = 3 pieces. Tasteless salad dressing, and the spicy tofu soup tasted like recycled miso soup with some chili oil.  Reminds me of the Red Lobster unlimited shrimp scam, where they make you wait 20 minutes for 5 more pieces of shrimp, in the the hopes that the customers get tired of it and leave. Pick the lowest rated Korean BBQ on Spring Mountain, and it'll be heads and shoulders above this one. If this survives the next three months, it'll be only because there is no other Korean BBQ in the area. Avoid at all costs !",

Than I imagined myself taking shots of Jameson as I burn my briskets and and pork belly... So I made the choice at sitting at booths. The Host at the time insisted we sat at the high chairs because there wasn't any booths available... that wasn't True at all because we counted 9 booths available at that time. Then I was advised they were all reserved for larger groups. I looked at the host and told her that I had back pains of course with my signature puppy \"wawah\" face and boom we got a booth! I guess a party of 3 wasn't large enough for a 4 seater booth... whomp!  The menu blew my mind!! I've never seen so much selection! My mouth couldn't stop drooling! My GF was overwhelmed with all the selection that lead to instantly selecting all the basics.... I wanted to explore but I also didn't want to be stuck eating everything! There is also a fun selection of appetizers. The quality in the meats I've tried are great and well portioned. Note- if you order the short ribs be prepared to tell them how many. The appetizer pictures can be a bit deceiving but it was still delicious. I can go on about details on each bite but I wont! I'll let you taste it for yourselves. Our server was a bit in the goofy side but after he admitted that he was food drunk and just finished eating before he served us, I completely understood him because the food definitely made me feel some kind of way.. A good sleepy food coma type of way lol! Overall the service was awesome, the food quality was great but the appetizers needed a little more love and perhaps a bit more selection on the side dishes as well. I'm definitely coming back for more and rolling in deep with a huge group! AlsoThanks to ummmm I think his name is Trevor? Teddy? Todd? Or Tom? Hope I got one of them right...! Lol awesome service bud! #iam3am airuzz@instagram",

The meat was very tough & they rated this premium steak & it was the toughest piece of meat I ever had!  The over head music was too loud, we couldn't even hear the waitress!! The food is bad & service is bad!!!",

    "text": "Food was good but there were multiple problems with this place. One the server was being a petty ass bitch who was rude as shit. I asked for a water and she decided to give me lemonade and when she was corrected, never came back with my cup of water. I would understand if it was busy but the lack of customers in here along with the amount of workers definitely does not reflect their customer service. Another thing, I asked for rice yet they decided to give us rice paper due to their rice cooker being broken. The rice paper was not only oily but had the consistency of raw squid skin. The rice paper looked like baby wipes and tasted like I decided to drink some crisco oil. The only positive thing about this place was the price. It was cheaper then the other Korean joints out here but I guess the price reflects its service. Most likely won't want to drive down to this side of town just to eat here.",

We had the \"pleasure\" of having Julian as our waiter last night. Completely unapproachable and inattentive. We would wait patiently for refills, reordering, etc but would end up flagging someone else down because we were ignored by Julian after our first order. We would see him roaming the restaurant, chatting it up with other waiters. We eventually saw him not even in uniform anymore cleaning the restaurant, everyone was. My friends and I also work in the service industry, so we completely understand cleaning when you can so you can close. But the restaurant wasn't closing for another 50 minutes! The hostess asked if she could take our payments so she could close the register (almost an hour before close...ok?). Whatever, no big deal. But no surprise, after she took our money, we received ZERO service. We weren't even done eating! I had to go up to the hostess to ask for a simple refill of our water because we still had food left to eat and no waiters to be seen. (And no, the restaurant still wasn't closing for another thirty minutes) I will never recommend another person there.",

We decided to sit inside and wait until we were called, 30 mins goes by and we notice that people that checked in AFTER us were getting tables while we sat there still waiting. Mind you there was only 2 of us which you would think it would be easier to seat rather than a big group. We decided to approach the host to let her know what is the status about our table and why is everyone else getting seated before us and she turns the iPad to us and says \" I did call you guys and you never came\", usually I can hold my temper but that's when I got pissed and preceded to tell her that,  \"you never called us and we have been sitting inside practically right next to the host booth  and not once did we hear you call our name, you've called every other group that came AFTER and BEFORE us.\" All she does is she quickly grabs menus and motions us to follow her to table. She quietly says sorry under her breathe. All in all the food was good, our server Howard as he also goes by, was sweet and very helpful and helped us choose some great meats. But what really made our visit better than how it started was actually not a worker, but another customer that sat next to us, she was sweet and actually helped us out on how to cook the meats and tips and tricks. I will most likely come back again to give the service another try, but basically the hostess needs to get her act together.",

Just minor issues like servers not visiting the table as often as I think they should to check on the guests' status, topping off water glasses or checking for refills on drinks, again just minor stuff. What's worse is the place wasn't really that busy at the times that we have dined there. I have more tolerance than most when it come to stuff like this so I I won't slam them too hard. Our experience from our visit on 5/85/2016 was the worst so far but even at that, just minor things again were at issue. Really the purpose of this review is to give kudos to one specific individual, a server by the name of Shae. She was absolutely fantastic. I think she observed a bit of dissatisfaction from the patrons at our table and immediately offered her service and was prompt, courteous and friendly. She stayed consistent by coming back to out table frequently to check if we needed anything. So, just want to say \"Great job, Shae!!!\"",

The meat selection is amazing and big so many choices to pick from . We all like Korean BBQ and hated to drive all the way to china town to get our fix of it and we thought that they needed to open one in the Henderson area. So when we found out that a Gen was opening up right up the street from us we were so happy because we thought that The quality of meats, service and atmosphere that they offer is what is missing from the Korean BBQ places in china town. They've been open less than a week and my family and I have gone twice already . They have good people working there but we were treated marvelously by TOMMY & RICHARD They were both AMAZING!!! And provided great service DEFINITELY!!!  ask for either one of this gentleman when you go they will take care of you... P.s the only reason I didn't give them 5 starts is because they did not bring over one of our favorite meats Hawaiian meat so please owner please bring it here as well we love it.......",

    "text": "I have been here on the past two Sunday afternoons and had two completely different experiences. The first was definitely a 5 star experience which was why we returned with friends for the second time. On the first visit, the restaurant was exceptional with friendly staff and fast service!  The food was great and it was so much fun!  We brought some friends for lunch today and I have to say it was embarrassing that we recommended it. The waiter introduced himself then proceeded to give us a list of several rules we needed to follow. We were to pay dinner prices at lunchtime, and he repeated that if we left any food uneaten at the table we were to be charged extra. People don't want to sit down at a restaurant and hear a bunch of rules from the waiter in the first minute after being seated. I would change that. While we were sitting at the table, my friend's husband came in for a quick visit before heading to work and sat down at our table. The waiter came over and asked what he wanted to drink and he said he wasn't eating and that he would be there just for a minute before going to work. The waiter then told him that if he was sitting at the table he would be charged the full price of $19.99 and that was their policy. Needless to say my friend's husband was insulted and left upset.  He was literally staying for a couple of minutes just to see his wife before work. It's such a shame because I really love the food and the atmosphere of gen but will probably not go back because of the service this time.",

Aside from my preferences, all of the people in the restaurant are very friendly and laid back. Because of the service alone, I would visit again. The food is also fantastic although, the kimchi has had a funny taste to it. The beef bulgogi is very good and the meat seems to be marinated well. While the garlic calamari is good, it could have a bit more flavor. I also like that there are ready made options for picky eaters like my brother. They have chicken Katsu and fried calamari. Their japchae is pretty good as well. It's great for family and friend gatherings and there's plenty of room to accommodate a large family in a booth. If you request a certain game or channel to be put on the big screen, they will generally accommodate you. Lastly, I hate the tipping system! I requested that my tip go to a specific server and was told it couldn't be given that way because it's put into a pool. This makes no sense because my server may have worked hard to help my table but, the server serving the table next to me may not have been as helpful. Please change this policy because I intend for my tip to go to the person who actually worked to help me, not the person serving the table next to mine.",

    "text": "I was impressed with the menu. Lots of things to choose from for new and experienced kbbq consumers. The variety of proteins was very balanced between \"strange\" meats and common such as chicken. The price is really good for dinner. Slightly cheaper than most places. I'd been craving soondoboo jjigae (spicy tofu stew) for a while. When I saw that they had it I was excited. When I ordered and got it.....not so much. It looked so watered down and the tofu looked like it was mashed up. The deokbokki was strange to me. It was crispy and the sauce was overly sweet it was almost like I should have ordered it for desert.  The banchan honestly is part of what makes kbbq what it is for me and this place SUCKED!!!! The kimchi was alright but your selection was so bleh because you only had four to choose from. The KFC was really good and definitely would be getting that more often. The portions were a little on the smaller side than I was used to but that's fine. Order little by little. The service was great, the server was very attentive and changed the grill when I asked. Expect to smell like meat because there were no vents. The ambiance was nice though, super modern. Would I go again? Sure if someone asked me to go. Would I actively try to go or recommend it right off the bad? Probably not I'd rather go to Chinatown.",

I like that the meat were so fresh, which is not normally seen at other Korean BBQ restaurants. The AYCE price is only $19.99 for dinner with more than 30 menu items!!! We ordered lots of meat and appetizers. I love #9 (Beef short plate) and #3 (Beef Brisket). My friends really love the spicy baby octopus. That was too spicy for me but the flavor was great. The restaurant was so popular that we needed to wait for over 20 minutes. However, the service was great even the restaurant was filled up all the time. Our server YUHAO (also called Howard) did great job and he always checked with us. He never forgot our special requests. Every food runner and busser was just always nice and friendly. Great service plus delicious food. I guess that is the reason everyone wants to come here.",

    "text": "My friends and I came on opening night around 9pm.  There was a pretty good amount of people but we were seated in about 5 mins. It's located in Galleria Mall so we were quite excited that it was somewhat close to us considering we live in the Henderson area. I should have noted that before we stepped inside this establishment. Most of the menu was catered towards the dominant American population's taste.  I don't know what they consider \"premium\" but the meat was definitely not authentic. The pork belly was not black pork belly usually used at other kbbq restaurants. The chadol aka thinly sliced beef brisket was two or three times thicker than it should have been making it less savory, more dry and lean. Note that the bulgogi used the same thickness of meat.   They had no boricha (korean tea),  gochujjang (red pepper paste), steamed egg, and soybean soup. Knowing  we paid $20 a person for three people and that some of the essentials in a kbbq dinner were unavailable made our dining experience very very unsatisfying. We could have paid less at another place at ala carte price and still have left completely satisfied.   It was nice to note that the bar actually has grills installed in it. The grill itself throughout the place seemed to burn too quickly however.  Although it was slow sometimes (getting an extra place setting, water and drinks, rice, and paying out), the service was very good. I know that they are just starting out right now but I know for sure we won't be back.. at least anytime soon..",

    "text": "After hearing about this place from a few friends I had to check this place out.  I walked in on a weekday lunch, without an appointment.  No problem seating us.  The place was nice and new.  It didn't reek of bbq, which was nice.  I came here for their lunch buffet which is $14.99!  Such a good deal!   There are some items that are not available on the lunch menu, but still a lot to enjoy.  I had the steak, sesame chicken and the squid legs are probably my favorites.  The spicy pork was also good.  I could not try everything on the menu, but there is enough for me to keep coming back.  Just an FYI there is a 2 hr eating limit.  One of my gripes was at the end of the meal I asked if they have tea, and the server said they do and would bring some over.  They asked who wanted, and 3 of us raised our hands.  Then came the bill...$1.50 for each cup of tea!  I would have wished to be informed that it wasn't complimentary.  In most Asian restaurants tea is free like water.  To make matters worse, the tea wasn't very good either.  I told the hostess that we were not informed that the tea would be an extra cost, and she just gave me an \"Oh Well\" kind of look.  If I had know I would be charged I would have passed on the tea.  I didn't even drink the whole glass.  I didn't take the matter any further and just paid for the the damn tea and still gave them 20% tip.  I know I'm a idiot.  Overall, I am willing to give this place a chance again.  As some reviewers have mentioned, this place does need to workout some hiccups in their service.  We had some items we ordered take forever, or forgotten completely, but it was okay for us.  Not a big deal.  Then the tea thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, in more ways than one.  If I was the hostess, I would have taken the item off the bill and note that in the future I would be a $1.50.  The tea probably only cost them 5 cents!  It could have made the whole experience more positive!  I look forward to hearing that things will improve there.",

I think it's great that they have a grill in the center of the table to be able to cook your own food. Can't beat the all you can eat stipulation BUT it took FOREVER for your food to cook. If you are starving, do not sit at the tables with the grills. The food and the extra sides were great but as far as what you had to cook for yourself it was like ughhhh hurry up so I can eat you! Lol",

    "text": "Finally open in Vegas! Came to try out this new open AYCE Korean BBQ place! I'll try keep it simple yet detail in this review. What got my attention at first when I walk in was the layout and design of the place, inside with neon lights around and  design looks unique bar look like this suppose be in casino :)! Make sure if there is a wait, don't just put your name down, but can also ask to put your # down for notification mins before table ready so you don't have to wait inside crowded if is busy. Plus the location is right outside galleria mall, so can always go next store check around while waiting! After we got sat down at the booth, few side dishes was already prepared for us on the table! Our server got here really quick and took out drink order first. Honestly I don't really remember the name cause the fact seems our table don't have a pacific server. But however after we got our drinks we were ready to order some meat to cook:) so many choices !! 32 dishes for dinner to choose from! I guess cause they just open and the servers haven't memorize the menu, so when I order by name , the server was asking/confirming by number which I totally understand . Only can order \"4\" dish at a time which is not bad, so it prevent people from wasting food :) got our meat , start cooking, make sure when they put oil on top the pan, it enough, sometimes at first they didn't seem put enough . The meat was just juicy and delicious!! I love it, no need much flavor and every plate was great:) the steak comes with full piece too but can always cut to pieces. Basically on food over all was great, but only  reason I gave 4 star was on service (which I rather put 4 1/2 star but there is no choice lol)  is not a big deal, and I understand just open and servers still new getting use to it, many of different servers come to our table check on us like every 10mins or so, is not bad checking up but was bit too much  , and their food comes out quick so if something you order took awhile they probably forgot and just got to remind them:) their air suctioning fan right on the side of where you cooking very nice and simple! I recommend order some slice radish piece if you like to wrap small piece meat and eat it, balance the flavor and more appetite. Also there is some disharmony they only have for dinner menu. Will defiantly come back again! Hope to see you all soon!  Pros: *location *design *food *menu choices *price defiantly ( L. $14.99 D. $19.99)  Cons: Nothing major:)",

    "text": "I've been here twice in their opening week and have had good experiences both times. It's really packed at lunch, so it's convenient that Galleria Mall is right next door. They'll text you when a table is ready so feel free to shop around or even gamble for a while right across the street.  Something I've noticed is that their pork belly has a noticeable amount of cartilage in it.   They seem strict with their two hour rule and they will also charge for any food you didn't finish within the time limit. They also give small portions at a time (which takes a while to come out), so I wouldn't recommend coming with parties larger than 6.  I know that they just opened, so I have faith that they'll do much better in a few months. Hopefully they keep the prices low as well (1 time charge for refillable soft drinks & $19 for their 32 item dinner menu + appetizers.)!",

We had a party of 10 adults and 1 baby. First the waiter asked how old is my baby and I told him he is two and he gave me the look as if he didn't trust my word for it. He asked me once more and I gave the same answer.   After we all sat down, my son started to have a bloody nose, and I asked for extra napkins to attempt to stop the bleeding, but they took their time and said please use the restroom because he was bleeding too much. I didn't say anything and did as they asked. After coming out from the restroom, took my son to the car to let him rest up with his mom. I went back to let the group to start ordering the meat without my wife and I. I assumed that the Gen in Orange County had great service before and will be able to accommodate my group without me, but they provided terrible service. The grill wasn't changed not till upon request. We ordered veggies but they took their time bringing it out.  After the group ate for about 30 minutes, since everyone was concerned for my son, I asked for the bill so that we come back to the hotel, and they charged is for 10 people!! I was shocked since my wife was out in the car and she didn't even get to sit to dine. I asked them why they charged for 10 rather than 9 since my wife didn't even had a bite to eat, their initial response was unfortunately you told us 10 adults and 1 baby they have to charge. I asked but she didn't even eat anything or even touch her plate, she used the restroom to tend to my son and left to the car right away. They then said that once she comes inside the store they will charge. I asked to speak with a manager, and she said the samething.   Worse experience at Gen ever!!",

    "text": "My second time here and I can confirm my positive first impression of this place wasn't a fluke...  4 Food 5 Service 4 Value  The food was good...we stuck mainly with the thin ribeye, bulgogi and the galbisal out of the dozen or so options offered. The spicy pork bulgogi was also a hit.   I like my Kimchi a little more funky/strong but I'm an unusual white boy. I also wish they offered full lettuce leaves with which to make an Asian lettuce wrap with the grilled meat rather than the lettuce strips in a bowl.  Appetizers:  STAY AWAY from anything that is fried/breaded as the breading was way heavy. Popcorn shrimp: 80% breading (seriously could not see the shrimp) Pork cutlet 60% breading. Fried squid about 70% breading...and the breading was salty. No thanks.  DO GET the K.F.C chicken. It's like orange chicken but with a slightly spicy Korean sauce coating it.  I see people complaining on yelp about having 4 different servers and not knowing who their server was...I see this as a positive. Due to the amount of servers floating around, my glass was never half empty, the side dishes were always refilled, our next round of meat orders were taken even before the current one could hit the grill. Our grills were changed frequently without having to ask. Waiters were friendly and extremely attentive. Why would I want to hunt down \"my server\" if I needed a grill change? I felt things ran smooth.  Value was spot on. For $20 I walked out extremely satisfied. I could definitely see myself coming here monthly if they opened one up in Summerlin...driving way out to the bowels of Henderson is a schlep.",

    "text": "**This review is on the service**  Unfortunately, my family and I had a really bad experience at this establishment. We were a party of 6 adults and 3 kids. We were given the table all the way in back, right next to the restrooms, and where the servers deposit dirty dishes (actually tossed them in a big container making loud noises thus scaring our kids). Since we were a big party gratuity was already included, and I strongly feel this is why our waitress service was crap. She rarely visited our table. She would walk pass our table and as we called her she'd ignored us. When our orders where actually taken, we had to keep asking different waiters about them because they took forever to be brought out.   I left Gen Korean bbq house as a very unsatisfied customer, who spent $20.99(dinner price) along with her family. For the amount of money that my husband and I ended up paying with the additional $26 gratuity, which was added automatically, I expected our orders to be out in time and our drinks refilled.  Sadly (and I say sadly because I really love Korean bbq) I nor my family will not be dining at this establishment again.",

We didn't know that it was ONLY all you can eat kbbq otherwise we would have saved our stomach to eat some more but the pricing wasn't bad. The restaurant is very clean and the employees were very helpful! They had the table all ready with all the Kim chi side dishes, a salad and jap chae out for us to eat. We ordered gen beef bulgogi (my favorite), spicy pork belly (second favorite), Cajun calamari (wasn't a big fan, id rather have fried calamari), and gen hangjungsal (the meat was really dry).. wish our stomach could take more food in but that's all we ordered! I love that the employees switch off the grill after each meat we cook so that we don't taste the other meat or continue cooking it on a burnt grill.",

The waiter even recognize her and he said \"back so soon?\"  I informed the host that she had just ate Gen and she was accompanying a different party. The female host in the white blouse stated she would try to accommodate us. But after she  briefly spoke with management, they stated their policy was to charge everyone at the sitting table. I think that is a bit inconsiderate when there are 4 potential customers willing to eat at the establishment.   We left and went to a different AYCE KBBQ called Arirang, which had extremely better service and minimum wait times. They had also accommodated all 5 of us, but minus 1, because my sister was not eating. Their gyoza taste 10x better than Gen as well.    I think im going to stop supporting this corporate/franchise KBBQ from now and stick with the locals.",

    "text": "Goodbye Spring Mountain. Gen in Henderson is where I'm going for my Korean BBQ fix from now on.  Yeah sure, parking in the Galleria Mall Parking lot kills the authentic feeling other BBQ joints in China Town have (Yes, it's in the mall BUT it has an outdoor entrance so don't worry, shopping addicts) but you'll feel better once inside. The inside is designed to look sort of like a club, slightly obnoxiously loud pop music with a giant projector showing music videos in the background. I read a study once that eating with fast paced music makes you eat more. That was definitely the case at Gen today.... Or maybe it was that the food was too good.   $14.99 for lunch, $19.99 for dinner. (Dinner price all day on the weekends!) The dinner menu includes a couple of extra plates, many are the same meats, but have the word \"premium\" in front. Lunch for me it is.   Gen Chadol: Aka Brisket. Aka MY FAVORITE. Thinly sliced meat with a bit of visible fat, but none of that chewiness everyone hates.  Beef Tongue: Small portion, very similar to the brisket, less fat than brisket.  Bulgogi: Chewy, flavorful, chunks of meat with some onions. I don't need to explain it, it's a must for every trip to Korean BBQ.  Smoked Garlic Pork Belly: We opted to order the garlic version rather than the plain pork belly, simply because it had a \"Chef recommended\" stamp next to it. It didn't have much of a garlic taste. It was basically thick slices of bacon. A little dry.  Cajun Shrimp: Yes, yes, yes. Small portion! Peeling the shrimps a hassle, but totally worth it.  Japchae: A little too oily and gooey for my liking. It did not have any meat or much of anything, but noodles. Skip it and save room for the meat.   They have the usual small plate appetizers ready to eat on the table. Kimchi, cucumbers, pickled onion and mashed potato? Whatever, it was good.  Rice is included if you ask for it.",

He explained the menu and which items were raw and which were the appetizers- all included in AYCE. Salad and Japche (noodles) also followed. So good!  He recommended the red wine pork belly -  very flavorful, thick pieces! Also had the brisket, steak and beef bulgogi... all good but small portions.  We had to ask for better pair of scissors because it was really tough to cut the steak with the ones they gave us.  They don't have short ribs but had something similar...it's the number 10 probably my favorite.  We tried the volcano chicken - like a very spicy orange chicken, tasty but hot! They ran out of KFC chicken too. Overall service was great and would recommend it especially to those who aren't familiar with Korean BBQ as they have a lot of cooked items to eat.",

    "text": "Finally an Asian restaurant in LV that appears to be clean and with good food! I have to give the location alone 5 stars because it's in Henderson (outside of the Galleria mall) which is in my neck of the woods.  There was quite a bit of a wait our first time but then we learned our lesson the second time and beat the dinner rush on a Friday night by arriving just before 5:45 pm.  Don't let the fact that there are no visible hoods above each table fool ya! It doesn't get holy smokey in there because they've forked the dough on some really super powerful venting system! Now the service, well they are beyond fully staffed and definitely didn't skimp out in this area because we never had to wait for anything. You sit down and BAM!...your sides are there.  There is a waiter who checks on you often and takes your ongoing orders, and another person who clears your table from the plates and changes your grill.  Food...well it's an AYCE dinner for $19.99 which is a heck of a bargain! From the 4 -5 variety of side dishes, rice paper and/or radish paper, appetizer and meat variety...there is quite a selection. We loved the crispy squid legs from the appetizer menu, finding ourselves ordering it throughout the night. The miso pork belly, bulgogi, Cajun shrimp head on, and calamari were are choices which were all equally tasty. Now for dessert they offer a n ice cream macaron for an addition $3.95....and oh so worth it! I had the coffee flavor while the hubby had the green tea.  Definitely a fave in my book!",

It's located next to the Red Robin; easy access from the parking lot.  You don't have to go into the mall for the entrance; a definite plus.   Upon arrival, I was greeted right away and the staff was super friendly and helpful.    Ozzy was our server and was very attentive and friendly, but what is more amazing is the other servers who aren't assigned to our table.  Everyone was eager to help and attentive to make sure we have everything we need.    The decor was very hip and club-like but with great lighting.    I think their selection of meats for the price is great.  They even have happy hours from 9:30 pm to closing.    I would definitely come back and recommend Gen, not only for the food but for the great service.",

But this time we left extremely dissatisfied and disgusted.  When we first walked in our shoes stuck to the ground because it was so sticky. Which we ignored because maybe someone spilt a drink, no big deal. Than we arrived at our table.. It looked clean but the second we sat down we felt a weird film over the seats and our hands covered in what we assume was grease on the table. We immediately informed the lady that seated us... instead of having someone come over and actually wipe down the table she hands us more napkins... Really? I didn't realize the people eating and paying also need to clean your mess.  So we waited until our waiter got to us and informed her, she was kind enough to offer to have our tables switched which of course we politely accepted.  Than we were faced with other problems. -The grill wouldn't get hot even after we asked her to turn it up -The scissors weren't sharp enough to cut the food -The waiter was no where to be found when we needed her -The food quality was very poor, weird textures, slimy consistency with the KFC which comes fully cooked. -Waited 15-30 minutes to pay our bill.  We could have walked out with out paying and no one would have noticed, that's how bad it was.  Like I said, we came here quite frequently at different times of the day and have NEVER had a problem like this. Tonight was just one disappointment after the other.  We will most likely not be returning to GEN and will be on the search for a new kbbq place.",

Not bad.  I especially like the spicy octopus n the galbi steak which was tender n had a good marinade. The squid was just salt n peppered. Utilize the scissors, ain't no table side service here. The only time they do anything at your table is when they change the grill. Fast process btw, they got it down to max efficiency.  We came in a little late at 10:30pm n their last call for meat orders is @11pm so we ordered a table full and spent the last hour just cooking n eating. Had a really good time. Our waiter isn't the most skilled at waiting but he certainly tries hard and is super nice.  Ambience is modern, music n blacklight... Nothing distracting though, pretty comforting not having to see other peeps too clearly.  Wish they've more assortment of banchon. Nothing seemed made in house. Still, unlimited so keep 'em coming!  They're located at Sunset Galleria (right across the casino) on second level next to Larson's. Outdoor entrance.",

You can choose appetizers which are included, and various meats to cook at the table. There are cold sides on the table right away. We started with Korean Fried Chicken, JapCha noodles, and fried tofu. For dinner, collectively, we had brisket, marinated steak, cajun shrimp, and calamari. The best was the marinated steak.   The service is what impressed me the most. I cannot say enough about how attentive the whole staff was. We never had to wait long for anything. Full drinks, full bellies, fabulous service. The restaurant doesn't feel like a cheap buffet because the ambiance and feel is hip and trendy. It was $49 with tax for two with sodas. I love the blue lights everywhere. I'll for sure come back and recommend this place for people who want something new.",

I actually found the items that were pre-cooked (e.g. KFC) and the side items (salad, kimchi, and potato salad) to be better than the main dishes that you cook at the table.   As for the cook-at-the-table items, the beef bulgogi didn't quite taste like bulgogi and was disappointing; however, the pork bulgogi was better marinated. The Gen Chadol was also disappointing and very bland. The best item was the garlic pork belly which was tastiest when you got it a little crispy like bacon.   Overall, we left full but not quite satisfied with the meal. I think the menu is the same for dinner which raises the cost to $20.99 so I recommend trying it out for lunch first.",

    "text": "This place is very good, went for dinner very specifically so we could try the few items that are only dinner items. Let's start by saying, the atmosphere was very nice, upscale and clean.  I've spent 20 years immersed in the Korean culture spent a considerable amount of time in Korea and attending Korean events, this restaurant is hit for the most part. There are a couple things that aren't right and that's why they didn't get a 5 star. Let's start with what was amazing, the beef tongue was unbelievable, we ordered that 5 times, the steak was out of this world for the price and quality. The first waiter we had started waiting tables for the first day when we arrived, so he wasn't very good and seemed very confused as to what to bring to the table. We needed to ask for a bowl of rice otherwise it would have been protein overload. The one thing I didn't like about Gen's is, they don't have the traditional leaves to wrap your rice, meat and bean paste in. I asked for it and I got radish wraps, they are tasty but very small. Next time I go back I'll be bringing romaine lettuce from my local Sam's Club. The waiter all though he was new, was not a big deal, he was trying something new in his career and I think that deserves a little patience as he learns. The lack of romaine lettuce to wrap my cook protein, rice, bean paste and fresh garlic was a bum deal. I'm assuming the restaurant will work this out eventually and will probably offer a better wrap later. Overall the restaurant was very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try a Korean BBQ, it's fun, inexpensive and a nice night out.",

The server only came around when we needed to order and when she dropped off our check. I only saw two servers on our side of the restaurant. They need to hire more staff and seat accordingly. The KFC chicken appetizer and the calamari was the only thing that stood out for me. The other meats were just bland. I really wanted to like this place since it's so close by and it's pretty cheap. But you have a two hour limit and it's hard to track down your server to actually order and once you do order it takes forever for the food to come out so you don't really get all you can eat. And the server had the audacity to ask us to give her a shout out on yelp and give the restaurant five stars for a free beer. That's the only reason this place has 4.5 stars.",

    "text": "Yay! A new Korean bbq place for us to try! I am always excited to try a new Korean bbq place and I was even more excited when I found out they have a franchise all over the country.  First and foremost the place looks great. It's located right next to the galleria mall and has giant signs, so you can't really miss it. The inside looks fancy and their seating is comfy. We went on a Sunday during lunch time so it was getting busy, but we got seated in no time. At first everyone was super friendly, we had a really nice guy who kept asking if we got our order and drinks in, but it just went downhill after that. After we got our first wave of food in, we waited for a waiter to ask us if we needed more, but no one came. We then asked the bus boy if we can order more food and he said \"of course\" and whispered to the waiter who was taking an order at the table next to us, but after he finished he walked away, and so we waited. 15 more minutes, no one came, so we asked another girl who walked by if we can order, and she said she would get a server to us. Then another 10 more minutes went by and with no food on our grill, we stopped another person and they were a server, so he got our order in (but forgot the sesame oil). We got our food, but still no sesame oil, until a really polite girl walked by and we asked and she obliged. When we finished we asked a waiter for our check. While we were waiting we were trying to get a water refill, and was completely ignored by a waiter with a jug of water after yelling out \"excuse me\" who proceeded to fill up the table behind us and walk. We finally got someone to refill our water and our green tea, but was still waiting for our check. About 20 minutes after asking for the check we finally decided to give up and walk up to the counter where we tried to pay, but was rudely denied by the lady at the counter who said we had to pay at our table. We told her that we've been waiting 20 minutes for the check, and she sarcastically said \"really? That long\" but luckily the lady who seated us early defended us and agreed that it was been quiet awhile since we've been here. She was happy to get our check and apologized over and over again for their lack of service. All in all their food was alright, but for a restaurant that has a country wide franchise I really expected the service to be quicker. It always may have to do with the fact that the servers pretty much have a free for all because they don't have sections and don't keep track of what stage of the eating process each table are on.",

They were on point every time with our high demands.   If you are familiar with GEN then you know they set them selves apart from other KBBQ with their special marinades and wide selection of meats choices. Aside from brisket that I can eat all day, I recommend trying the Galbisal which is the marinated short rib steaks.. it is absolutely phenomenal.   The ambience inside is nice with the stencil art up towards the ceiling, the huge projection tv and and hip music. I am definitely coming back and telling everyone about this new gem in our town.",

Miso soup needed more miso paste and everything was pretty bland or marinated from conventional sauces u can get from the store. The chicken was seasoned with Thai chili sauce. Seems like everyone hyped it up because of the decor and music but besides that it was a let down when it came to the food.",

    "text": "I'm going to keep this review short and concise to get my point across.  Me and my friends came here for Halloween for dinner. The hostess took down our name and we were immediately seated at our table not even 30 seconds later, so that was big plus. We ordered our food and immediately we got our food. Fast service is also a big plus. Here's where it went downhill.  1. I ordered Kalbi, one of the best Korean meats you can eat, and when it came out, it was only one slab of meat. All the other Korean restaurants I went to, I always got a plateful with stacks of Kalbi. But here, I only got...one. And it wasn't even good. So, portion wise, Gen should add way more meat.  2. This is just my two cents, but the menu needs work. This is a Korean restaurant and there were no Korean words in the menu. Only the English equivalents which made it confusing.   3. The grill wasn't even hot. Even when I turned it way up it wasn't warm enough.   4. This one really made me reel over. After dinner, I asked for the dessert menu: They said they don't serve dessert. Whhhaaaaaaaaat?! You can see my reaction. What kind of place has no dessert?! I understand it's a new joint and it just opened, but seriously? Not even Sikhye?? (traditional Korean beverage, Google it)   5. The foods themselves were okay. The workers there were okay.   ***6. Oh, and make sure you remember this: if you want to split the bill, the maximum they can do is up to 3 people. So me and one other friend had to combine our bills. That was just frustrating.   Overall, in Vegas there are way better choices for Korean food. I recommend Sura. At least there you can grab however much you want to eat. And they have dessert.",

    "text": "I have been to quite a few Korean BBQ places and this is the last place I'd think of eating at. Customer service makes a huge difference when it comes to an overall customer experience. I came here with three friends and we instantly fell in love with the environment. It is so modern and the ambiance sets off a good vibe, we were given drinks and our sides, and asked our waitress a lot of questions since it was our first time. Rude off the bat - she was very impatient with us and in the middle of asking her questions she'd talk to the table near by to get their order. As shocked as we were we just proceeded to order with her once she finally came back. I'm a short ribs lover as well as the rest of my party so we put in 1 order not knowing it was going to be a slice on one plate, and our waitress knew because that's all we ordered so when she came back with the one slice of rib she put it on the table as if she knew 4 people could share that ONE SLICE! Ridiculous. We had to wave her down and order 16 orders of short ribs, she stops writing down our order, looks at us, and says \"16 short ribs?!\" YES GIRL, what else did we say? We killed that one slice of short rib in a second between us 4, we want more than ONE rib to eat LOL We waited for a long time and when she came to give us our short ribs, one slice was on one plate, aka, she brought out 16 plates of individual sliced short ribs to us, why not just put the 16 pieces on one big plate?! Anyways, her service was slow and rude, we always had to flag her down, we only refilled our waters ONCE because she never came to check on us or looked our way to grab her attention. Towards the end another server helped us because she explained that our previous server had to clock out, our previous server didn't even warn us of the server switch because if she notified us then we'd we looking out for the second server instead of waiting and looking out for her instead. Our second server appeared to have more tables to cover yet she was on top of her game to try and pick up what the first server has started with us, and I appreciated that! However, upon finishing up and paying I do not think what I paid was worth the experience, worth the long waits, or even with tolerating the rude server.",

    "text": "DON'T, JUST DON'T! We went there at about 10PM on a Saturday and w-a-i-t-e-d to be seated. They put our party of seven at a table so small, they had to add a chair to the end of the table. Plus, the wait staff was extremely rude, and it took a long time to order and get our meat. After sitting there starving, and finally getting our meat, we then found that their grill was S-L-O-W!  We told two regular employees about the grill (with no resolution), then asked for the manager, and was given the \"assistant\" manager (still no resolution).  You only get a certain amount of time to eat there, and our wait staff told us that we had to have our last order in by 11:00. After complaining more, and more waiting, we finally got the \"real\" manager, Eugene Kang, who was the rudest, and argued with us about the wait time, and told us that the wait staff did NOT tell us that 11PM was the cutoff time (unTrue, and unless he was at the table, how could he know what seven people heard), arguing about the cooker, etc., and more and he was VERY CONFRONTATIVE.  It was readily apparent that he was enjoying his position of power at that restaurant. It was embarrassing, and my daughter wanted to be away from everyone seated near us.  When she stood up, HE STOOD IN FRONT OF HER AND PHYSICALLY BLOCKED HER!!! She was so intimidated that she called the police, and a report was made, resulting in one of those little white cards explaining rights to victims of crimes.  Even after all of this, the manager was lying, stating that we ordered 22 orders of meat and had eaten all of them but one, when there was a grill full of uncooked meat at the table, and more meat raw on the table that could not be put on the grill. At least two of us had a very tight throat, two of us had the runs after eating there, and at least one of us still has a cramped stomach, two days later.  What we can gather, is that the food cooker is slow so that not a lot of meat can be cooked.  The entire staff was rude, and when I went to pay for mine so I could leave (I thought I was going to have to get medical care due to my stomach cramping and tight throat), there were three employees at the register who were smirking.  After the police came, the rest of our party left and were not made to pay, but I still AM PAYING even two days later, with stomach cramping.  Overall, this is a horrible establishment with staff that is RUDE, and it is VERY apparent that they don't care about their customers.  Don't go there.  There are many other \"real\" Korean BBQ's in town that DO CARE, cost less money, and appreciate their patrons.  Our understanding is that the Henderson Gen Barbecue House is one branch of an overall CHAIN OF RESTAURANTS.",

The serving sizes aren't huge so you don't have to worry about not finishing or not being able to try everything.  Environment 5/5 The setting is awesome. They have vents on the side of the grills which means you won't have to smell like KBBQ so much after you eat and worry about someone complimenting you on your delicious cologne! The place looks very contemporary and very orderly.  Service 5/5 The service is great. Their system is automated so if you have to wait for a table you will get texts when they are ready for you which is perfect since it is right at the Galleria Mall you can walk around a bit instead of just waiting on the inside. Also shout out to Lisa and Mizzo for providing awesome services and being so patient with the large amounts of orders I made! :)  Overall 5/5 I am definitely going to come back. Best KBBQ with great service and fresh food.",

I think what makes Gen stand out is their outstanding service. Regardless of how busy the restaurant is, I feel like they are always well staffed and the employees are very quick and helpful.

It's pretty far from where my boyfriend and I live, but we thought we would try it and hopefully not be too attached to it.  We were wrong, everything was so delicious. Such a good variety of what to get, and our server RJ answered any questions that we had about our food. RJ made a lot of recommendations for my boyfriend and I, and everything he recommended was amazing. The premium steak was so tender, and basically melted in our mouth. The brisket was very delicious, and not too fatty like other Korean BBQ we have been in the past.   RJ also recommended some drinks for us, for my boyfriend he made a Moscow Mule, which in his words, was \"one of the best.\" For me, RJ recommended a lychini. I'm not one hundred percent sure what was in it, but it was amazing. Couldn't really taste the alcohol, but it was very smooth and tasted almost like roses.   And to end, we each ordered the macaroon ice cream sandwiches. My boyfriend ordered the coffee one, and I ordered the strawberry one. Although there was a small hair in mine, RJ quickly got me a new one without any problems.  This restaurant is pretty far from us, but honestly, it's worth the gas to eat here again! We will definitely be back.",

There were already 8 other parties ahead of us, so it took about 45 minutes to get a table but it was definitely worth it. If you're having a get together with friends during a busy time I would suggest trying to get someone there a bit early and putting their name on the list first and then go in the mall and shop around while they wait for the rest of the party to arrive. Just keep your phone handy because they text you when your table is almost ready.   The quality/taste of the food was great, the price is competitive (20$ for dinner and I think like 15$ for lunch), the place is nice and the service was great too! I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant and can't wait to come back.   It's quite a drive for me but it's definitely worth it. I won't ever go to other places like Sura or Hwaro again because they have a much larger selection of food. Their dinner menu is hugeee. There's 32 items that you can choose from and the appetizers are also part of the AYCE menu, so that was a definite plus! I'm not sure about the lunch menu, so definitely ask if you decide to go there. There's also no charge for rice.   Can't wait to go back here!",

We even asked for refills on water 3 times and they got refilled once!

When we got to our table there was a pretty late amount of food on the floor that the hostess said she would get cleaned up but no one ever came. Minus half a star for cleanliness.   Portion sizes were moderate, but you can order as much as you want so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Food quality was excellent and flavors were on point. Would recommend the beef short plate and the garlic or miso pork belly.   For two dinners and a soju plus tip I spent about $75, which is pretty pricey in my opinion for kbbq. I've had similar experiences in LA for a third of the price. Minus half a star for price-value relationship.   Our server JJ was BOMB. Extremely friendly and helpful with suggesting food options. Definitely recommend asking for her as a server if she's working.",

If you want more you hunt down a server, which can take a while, and then prepare to wait a long time for your next tiny platter of thinly-shaved, spoiled, tough, old meat.   Weird policy too with requiring you to eat everything or you get charged more money.  I've only been to one other Korean BBQ, Tofu Hut; the meat and service was substantially better at Tofu Hut even though the decor wasn't as spiffy.",

I was under the impression kids age 5-10 was 10$ but i was surprised when they measured my son to see if he was going to be full price. They said its new. So right off the bat got a little upset because my 8 year old son who is now paying full price hardly eats as much as an adult. Not their fault but I wish kids price was still in effect. Barely no wait time on a Saturday. So with a doubtful attitude, we began to order. Terry our server definitely changed the night. Always checking our drinks were filled and recommending what to try. At no time did we feel rushed to eat and leave like many all you can eat restaurants. The manager stood out to me as well because he was constantly walking around and even picked up some plates at our table. WHAT! What manager does that nowadays! Overall 5 stars and will be a great spot to try for those who have not.",

    "text": "I initially tried Gen Korean BBQ in California when visiting some friends over break. The food was delicious. When I found out that Vegas got a Gen, I was literally screaming with joy. Let me tell you, Gen is now my go-to Korean BBQ place considering that I used to be a die hard Tofu Hut fan.   The service here is always amazing. When you get there and ask for a table, they'll kindly ask for your first name and last initial & phone number. The reason being for the phone number is because they text you when your table is ready. So you could walk around the mall if you wanted to, then return when your table is ready. What I found cool about their reservation service is that along with texting you when your table is ready, they also have an app called \"NoWait.\" NoWait is an app where you can see the current wait time for the restaurant you're at. It shows you how many parties are in front of you. In this app, you can also add people in your party to show them your place in line. They also have a bar where you can chill while waiting for your table.  After being seated, they are really quick with drinks and orders. Considering my friends and I are regulars here, we already know what to order. Once we get seated, we start ordering by the boat loads. We always start by getting 3 orders of Japchae, #10, brisket and pork belly. Literally 2-5 mins later, the server is back with the orders. They check up on you every 10 mins or so, so that you can re-order. We always get the sesame chicken and the KFC. So good! Considering that we're asian, we need rice....and lots of it. This is sometimes a problem because they say \"sorry we're out of rice right now.\" However, that doesn't stop us from chowing down on just meat.   I like how the place is designed. It's very modern looking compared to the KBBQ places in china town. Every time I come here, we're always seated right away and the service is always fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this place but....MAKE MORE RICE PLEASE. I AM ASIAN AND I NEED MY RICE. That is all. oh wait one last thing:  K B B...really Q waiters/waitresses. Just sayin' ayyyyye!",

I wish they had steamed egg and daechang (large intestine) in addition to their side dishes and meat, but overall, it's hard to see such an expansive menu with such a nice price.

It wasn't the best. Everything else - yes ! We saw reviews about the service being mediocre, but our service was terrific! It wasn't just our server who checked on us, but everyone else. Alodia, our server, was so friendly and fun. She joked with us and gave us her honest opinion on the food. I'm glad she was honest with us because her recommendations were good! (Try the premium beef short plate). They also change out the hot plate frequently. Which was surprising! Rarely happens in china town.

But we came in for lunch on a Monday and we were surprised by how friendly, fast, and efficient the service was. Normally we are used to having a limit on the items you can order, and usually at Gen they take a long time to come back around, so by the time your 2 hours are up we don't feel like we get a lot to eat. But at this location there wasn't any limit and our server was very nice and attentive. The only thing I wish Gen had were a sauce bar (like many other AYCE kbbq places have) because the meal is kind of bland otherwise. Good for for a great price though and I will definitely recommend to anyone else in Vegas that wants good asian food.",

    "text": "I'd heard so many good things about Gen, I knew I had to visit. I recently had dinner there and was definitely impressed!  First of all, it's located at Galleria Mall, but you don't have to actually enter the mall to get to the restaurant, which is a plus (IMO). There is also tons of parking, which is another bonus.  The decor is super cute. It's dimly lit, but not overly romantic (unless you want it to be). It's not a small place either.  For $19.95 per person, it's hard to complain. It's AYCE and the food was all delicious. We seriously had a bit of everything. Be careful when ordering though, they will charge you extra for wasted food. I can imagine that would be pretty awkward.  My only complaint is that the service was slooooow. It took forever to get more water and even longer to get our check and pay. But it was nothing that would stop me from going back and I definitely look forward to eating at Gen again.",

    "text": "First of all I want to say we had a great time dining at Gen. Not just today but all the time. We live in the South West and we will drive all the way to Henderson to dine with them at least twice a month. Our server is amazing , our busser is great and we never have complaints.   However today I didn't feel so good about it after my dining experience. My husband left a hoodie at the restaurant and we didn't realize it until we got home. He called and the answer he got was \"we will look for it and call you back.\"  I know it is a busy restaurant but no I need an answer now because I can tell you exactly what my table number is and where he might have left it. I didn't like the answer he was given so I called myself. Lauren picked up the phone and clearly she was the person who spoke to my husband too. She gave me the same answer stating \"I have many checks to close and I do have to take priority of that first.\" Not a good attitude and she is probably closing a check that I paid with 20% gratuity on it. So I politely asked again if she could check the booth we just sat at. She told me again no because she was busy. Ok so I said you could put me on hold.   Approximately 5 minutes later, she came back on the phone and said \"we don't see anything, the people don't want to get up so we would have to call you later when busser is cleaning all the tables\"    And I said \"No Lauren I didn't tell you which table it is yet how do you know they don't want to get up ?\" She sighed and again with an attitude \"so what table is it ? \".  I told her the table and she came back in 30 seconds saying she got it.   So now the problem I have is what is the attitude about ?! We frequent the restaurant and honestly even it is our first time I expect better service like the server we had earlier. Also why would she lie about it ? It was such a simple task which took 30 second to check and we were on the phone for 10 mins for her to change my experience from wonderful to horrible. The vibe she gave me is she absolutely doesn't care about me and she has no intention in helping us. I mean at least pretend?!   Not good customer service. Not sure if we will go back.",

This place gets pretty busy during dinner time so be aware that the wait time for a table might be long. The atmosphere and design of the place is really nice and I enjoyed the big projector screen.  Once we got our table we were greeted immediately and our server was very nice and helped us with our order. I really enjoyed the brisket and the spicy bulgogi selections and they were all very juicy.  The meat does not take long to cool and it's a fun experience with family or friends. The servers use cool touchscreen pads to take our orders and the meat comes to our table pretty quick.  I really appreciate when one of the servers request for a grill change because over time our grill gets really greasy and dirty and we probably had our grill changed 4 times.  The overall service was excellent and will definitely recommend eating here for dinner.  Thanks!",

Remind you that this is a place where you have to cook your own food! So if burner acts up on and off, on and off you can't cook then you can't eat!!!  If you have a big party of people that made reservations make sure that your BURNERS or GRILL works! Aside from that bad experience I'm not gonna lie and say food is bad... because the FOOD was delicious and our server Dannile that was assigned to our table was very very pleasant and made sure to attend to our needs.

    "text": "BS +++  Yo! Genny from the block!!!  NYC Koreatown would love to add a spot like this in their  block!  But it's Vegas  and it will remain here.  First of, it's a clubby scene so try not to dress bummy folks.  I saw some questionable outfits there.  But wait! Why would you wear your Gucci and smell like Bogogi after? Nevermind.  Just wear your Underarmour hoodies and Nike sweats.  But  seriously if you are expecting an \"authentic\" all-out-cook-out KPop BBQ spot this is not it.  It's a modern twist to Korean BBQ.  But how can you hate the fact that they offer Korean Fried Chicken?!! Bon Chon you got competition! And for $22 per person and  an all you can  eat option.. SERIOUSLY GENNY YOU ARE KILLING ME!!  Thank God I am training to bulk up because your Hawaiian beef and flat iron beef is the BOOM.COM.  I can't say anything bad about this spot except for one thing..... I hated to say goodbye.  Your staff - SERIOUSLY the friendliest.  Are they all Canadian? Super nice.  Super sincere.  Super accommodating.  Super everything.  Folks this is just a fun spot for a date or to have a night out and drinks.  Don't compare it to anything else.  The place is in a popping mall.  Again I am coming from a different angle.  So all you foodies who wants to hate - HATE - but give  others a chance to try it.  Not all experiences are the same.  I never been here before BUT!!!! and this is a big ANUS - I been so A LOT of Korean BBQ spots and this  might not be the best but it has the best customer service and best  attitude any  restaurant has.  And that  deserves a try.  If you ever come  around LV.  I am calling out all my hipsters, gangster thugged out friends.  Come through yo! This spot is hot!  Food is BOMB Customer Service  is ATOMIC Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING Restrooms are CLEAN and toilets are RUSTIC Tables Clean and UPGRADED and COMFY Table wait time PLACE WAS PACKED but  got our tables ASAP Customer service is THE GAME CHANGER HERE! Ambiance Club like and dim. Music choices was a bit rowdy.  I didn't know whether to eat the beef or fight it!! hahahaha Kitchen SUPER CLEAN Overall experience was FUN!  I enjoyed this place.  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

I first tried Gen in October this year, It's all you can eat,  so it's quality I fear.  No fear no more, The food is just good. I came back multiple times, like I knew I would.   As for the meats, So, here's my take. The Signature's my favorite, it's their premium steak  The beef bulgogi is dry, the Chadol's too thin. The KFC is a winner, but the Signature still wins.    I'm a fan of meat, The service is great. Are they the best KBBQ?   Now that's the debate.  3 stars they earned, Qualities' okay. I would give more stars, But wasn't blown away.  So, who's my favorite? Does it really matter?  Just keep the food coming, with meat on my platter.  I've been here for dinner, and even for lunch. I will come back, for that protein punch.   So who am I? A Yelper with rhymes on the loose, Call me Mel C, Not Yelp's Doctor Seuss.  Peace!!",

    "text": "Pretty decent AYCE Korean BBQ experience. This is corporate America's take on Korean BBQ and although they get the service structure down, the food is just bland. The Tofu (Soondooboo) Soup is pretty bad so avoid that. In order to get Galbi you do have to upgrade to their premium menu. I usually get Brisket and Pork Belly but make sure you have enough marinate sauce otherwise just dry frozen meat. Otherwise the price is pretty fair for what you get. Service was great which is why they get 3 Stars but actual food quality you can try the other 3 Restaurants surrounding Gen for a better tasting experience. No hate just thought food was kinda bland and average for Korean BBQ",

Sure it's a chain and yes they recently changed the menu but all in all they have good quality meats with good service.  The recent menu change has dropped the price for ayce to $20 instead of $26 so that's great.  But don't expect to get kalbi.  That seems to be gone.   I like the side dishes and appetizers like the Korean fried chicken (KFC!) And the cheese stuffed pork.     To me they have the best side salad of all the kbbqs I've been to as well.   Overall, it's definitely where to go to get kbbq especially if you are on this side of town",

At the end of our meal, when the person that took our payment asked what our favorite part of dinner was...I told her it was our waitress! They don't take reservations but if you can request Alodia, I would!   I was surprised by how good the quality of the meat was considering the affordable AYCE price. ($20.99 for dinner) When you sit down, you have your standard side dishes on the table already and the server brings you salad. Once you place your order, the server will also bring rice for everyone at the table. My favorite items were Bulgogi and the K.F.C. chicken. (Korean Fried Chicken. It's a sweet and spicy chicken that comes to the table already cooked. We ordered it twice because it was so good! The Bulgogi takes a while to cook but it had the most flavor out of what I ordered. The only dish I didn't like was the pork belly. I'm usually a fan but it wasn't good at all. (I could only eat one bite)  If you're looking for an affordable, clean, yummy Korean BBQ restaurant, I would give this place a try! If you download the Nowait app, you can use it to get a table, with notifications of how many parties are ahead of you.",

You have to ask to get your grill changed when its burnt AF already and they just pass by. The portions are small that's why you have to keep ordering and bug the shit out of those damn servers which they pretend to take your order and don't show up with it for 15 min so you ask again. Hwaro and tofu hut will always be the best even though the wait time is twice as bad, it's worth it than spending money and time at Gen. The servers here really suck and a total piss off.",

    "text": "FINALLY!!! A delicious Kbbq spot in Las Vegas! I mean if you're a Cali person (like myself) then you know what good quality beef at a Korean bbq restaurant tastes like. I've eaten at other Kbbq joints in Vegas and this is NOTHING like those average places. Gen Korean BBQ House has premium quality beef and meat! Did I mention, it's all YOU can eat for a great price! The service is on point. Everyone from servers, to bussers, to the meat delivery staff, and the hostess are all so friendly. I will admit when my husband and I first walked into this place, it was super busy the hostess told us there was an hour wait. We were pretty bummed out by the wait but we decided to stay because this location is kinda far from our house since it is located in Henderson. Aside from the wait time, the food was  scrumdiddlyumptious! We came for dinner which is only $20 for all you can eat Korean BBQ PLUS all you can eat appetizers. How great is that? Such a good deal & so much food for a great price. I'm super stuffed! Our server, Yuhao aka Howard, was a friendly young gentleman. He was helpful, answered all questions, even noticed when our drinks & rice needed a refill! I'm very pleased with such great staff members for a premium Korean BBQ location. We will definitely be back and this will be our go to spot now that we live in Vegas! We didn't eat kbbq for about a year since we moved here and now that'll all change :)   Dishes I recommend were: Beef brisket Beef bulgogi Marinated premium steak  Dishes we ordered were : All the recommended ones && Spicy chicken Cajun shrimp  (Those ones weren't as delicious & shrimp takes too long to peel off when you just want to stuff your face!)  Appetizers we ordered Fried Gyoza Popcorn shrimp (delicious!!)",

But today was an experience, first of all I have to say our waiter Julian was a great waiter and he came to our aid during our little problem. Today, I ordered the KFC which is Korean Fried Chicken while eating the chicken, I notice the chicken was still partially raw on the inside even though I asked for it to be extra crispy which I would think that it would remain in the fryer for longer. I bought it to the hostess attention which she was very concerned and let us know that the meal would be comped due to the experience. After that a guy came by with blond hair and glasses, who I would assume was the manager and said that the meal could only be comped 50%. Like are you serious you literally just gave me raw chicken! (And I know what some of you are thinking its a BBQ place you cook it yourself..no this was an appetizer that the cooks prepared in the back for you.) We told the manager that was not what we were informed and that the meal would be comp. Both the waiter and the hostess came back and was like and both agreed that the meal should be taken care of due to what happened. After, they continually checked on me to make sure I was not sick! And thank goodness I was fine! Needless to say the waiter and hostess are awesome! So thank you Julian and hostess (sorry I didn't get your name), but that other guy needs some retraining.",

After he said that i expected to be waiting a long time for each order but he was dishing them out as fast as i was ordering.

Our prayers have finally been answered in the form of this modernized barbecue establishment at the Galleria Mall of all places. I have already eaten here twice during the soft open and was surprised by the taste and quality of the meats. The location is extremely convenient for anyone on the East side of the Valley and the price for all you can eat is hard to beat. Shout out to the bartender, Bryan, who provided an amazing experience for us!",

Within 5 minutes of placing our first order of meats they came out. Vegetables were good and plenty of choices in my opinion. We were not able to get rice. Waiter said the rice cooker broke right before we got there. We were checked on by several different servers and they accommodated every request quickly, even though it was packed.

First of all, the selections, there are 32 protein choices. I know because it's all over the menu. The choices are awesome, from bulgogi to marinated octopus. There's a surf and turf combination for U. And then the service, simply amazing. They really do work together to make your dining experience better. Everyone stops by to check on how you're doing. In particular, Tommy stands out, from carefully repeating our selections to kindly explaining the size of a beer tower, roughly 6 pints by the way. Awesome place!!!",

We didn't wait to long but there was steady traffic but still enough cleared tables to sit us down quickly.   Our server was Lisa She was very knowledgable & patient. When I asked about half orders again (thinking they would do it this time) she replied no but she also pointed out which items on the menu were small portioned & able to share between 2 girls. She didn't brush us off or seemed annoyed with us asking for rice paper every time she passed by, she didn't mind that we order one item at a time & she communicated with us that she was going on break so that someone else would be helping us. Her service is the only reason why I am giving this place 5 stars instead of 2 again. I'd ask to be seated in her section when I come back!  The food... Seaweed salad has a very weird after taste, not too fresh. Brisket still tasted like it was brisket. Cajun calamari/garlic calamari/pork belly/ short ribs were pretty good compared to last time.   The portion of the rice paper sucks (5 sheets or so) I mean .. If all the reviews are about rice paper why not portion it right?",

The management also stopped by my table and she asked  how the service is going. Which was a first for me with a All you can eat place.

    "text": "Gen in Henderson has to be the best AYCE Korean BBQ spot in Vegas. It's a relief that a large restaurant chain like this can provide quality at such an incredible price. I was hesitant at first, but I am now a believer.  To start off, we were informed of a 45 minute wait time. No problem. Like a lot of other restaurants, you write down your name and phone number and they'll let you know when your table is ready. We decided to check out the mall. After working up an appetite, we received a text that our table would be ready soon. We skidaddled back to the restaurant and our table was prepared within 10 minutes.   Upon arriving at our table, I noticed how everything was neatly placed: the plates, sauces, chopsticks, the cooking utensils, the salad, and the banchan. And let me tell you a thing about the banchan (those complimentary side dishes). It's some good quality tasty stuff and we ended up ordering a whole 'nother round of it during the middle of our meal. It's a shame that most of the diners eating around us weren't even touching it.   The meats were all of decent quality. We started off with the Gen Premium Chadol and the beef tongue. Both thinly sliced cuts of meat. I'd have to say the beef tongue edged out on the chadol this time around.   Next, we had the beef bulgogi and their signature galbi. I have to say they're both the best AYCE variants within their respected categories. Galbi is my absolute favorite K-BBQ meat, and they totally did it right. So much so that I ordered another serving towards the end of the meal.   Finally, we ended it with the premium steak and spicy baby octopus. The steak was literally a whole slab of beef. We cut the excess fat, and it paired well with the salt mix that was provided to us. Just don't overcook it! The spicy baby octopus could have been really good if it weren't for the excessive amount of sauce that was lathered on the dish. It was still tasty for what it was and I thought the octopus was juicy and tender.   The only thing I was disappointed with was that the server didn't bother to replace the grill top throughout our meal. It became a charred mess by the end. Other than that, our server was on top of it.   And even though the atmosphere sort of felt like a nightclub, the food was so good that it didn't bother me. I'll definitely be coming back, and I think I just found my new go-to Korean barbecue place.",

We knew we would be starving by the time she arrived, and I was under a lot of pressure when it came to deciding where to eat. Of course I did not want it to be a place you can find just anywhere, so I picked this spot and I am so glad I did. Prince was on the same page as us with the \"all you can eat\" always x 100 checking up on us, pulling out his tablet to recommend other meat options, always bringing us more rice, salad, etc. This place really is all you can eat, you're given a menu with different styles of beef, pork, seafood, chicken and others. 2 hours for all of this, it was amazing, I will be back with my fiance, and we will request to be seated in Prince' section!",

The lunch menu for grill selections had 34 great items and a great deal at $16.99. Some of them are the same cuts of meat, but with different marinades. Something that would be a nice addition to the menu is a guide to Korean BBQ, so those patrons new to it know what the meats are, how long they should cook them, and how to serve them.",

We do prefer the Sahara location to this one.  We have always been seated immediately. The lunch is $17 per person and dinner is $21. I don't find that the difference in dinner price is worth it, unless you looove short ribs. There are obviously other differences in the menus but to me, it isn't worth it.   The quality of meats are always delicious. We eat the ENTIRE time we are there. Our friend is an amazing cook, he's usually the one to cook. Since he knows what he's doing, we cook and eat very quickly so we consume a lot of meat.   We always order premium steak, beef bulgogi, and pork cheek. It's not a lot of variety but we order a lot of each.   The service is great. They are quick to refill our drinks, take our orders, and change our grills. Even when we are on our 10th order of premium steak, they still bring it out quickly. We have never had any issues with any of our orders or the service.

    "text": "Undoubtably there is a new contender for the best korean bbq restaurant in Las Vegas.  Gen Korean BBQ house offers some of the most delicious selections of meat and ALL of their appetizers are included for free!  Your group is allowed to select 4 appetizers and 4 meat selections at a time.  You then cook at the grill centered at your booth's table.  The price and quality can't be beat!  $15 for lunch and $20 for dinner, eat here now and get your money's worth!  Our server Kristina did a good job explaining the different meats and recommending meats for us to grill.  Our selections included the dinner only items (Roast Beef, Galbisal [marinated premium steak]) as well as premium pork belly, beef bulgolgi, and beef brisket.  As a tip, always get the beef brisket because it cooks really fast.  That way you have stuff to eat as the other thicker meats take its time to cook.    The appetizers we also ordered (again, surprisingly free)  included japchae (glass noodles), miso soup, seaweed salad, pork katsu cutlet, popcorn shrimp, korean fried chicken, and gyoza.   Of course staple mini dishes like kimchee, rice, spicy pickles, and potato salad were also included and waiting on the table when we were seated.  The service was great and overall there seemed to be enough staff as almost every booth was filled with customers and yet the food kept on coming.   There are plenty of tables in this large restaurant and parking is easy as it is connected to Galleria Mall.      So move over Tofu Hut, Hwaro, Sura, etc.. Gen's finally reached its way from California and I'm sure it's here to stay.",

    "text": "This place has gone from my least favorite to my favorite Korean bbq spot.  I guess based on my experience with new businesses opening, it's not always a good idea to do a review during the first month.  They really did a complete turn around each experience after.    So the rule of only being able to order just a certain amount of items at a time doesn't apply anymore.  In fact you can order as much as you want.  What I really love about this place is it it comes in a smaller portion size, which is still a good shareable amount, but it's not overwhelming to the point where you would get full off one order.  By ordering small, you get more opportunity to try more dishes!  Also, the \"hood system\" has greatly improved.  No more issues with the burner going out.    All their marinated meats are perfectly marinated, especially their bulgogi.  It comes with regular sliced onions as well as green onions, which makes it all better.  They offer rice or rice paper, and sesame oil is available.  The ice cream green tea macarons make the perfect dessert.",

    "text": "I've waited a long time for a restaurant opening near Galleria / Sunset Station that I can really get excited about. Well, I'm finally excited.  This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being \"chain restaurant\" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.  I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).  This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...  Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because \"sticky\" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.  Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.  They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.  I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows:   #3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the \"beefiest\" flavor.  #5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.  #7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.  #8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...  #10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.  #15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.  #17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.  #20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.  The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.  Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.  Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS.  We came here last night hungry and definitely got our money's worth.  Upon arriving there was a wait of about 30-40 minutes, the hostess asked for our phone number and we were able to track through an app how many parties were ahead of us, and then we were texted once our table was ready.  About an hour later, longer than we were quoted, we received a text informing us that our table was ready.  We arrived to the host stand and there was still about a 15 minute wait and one party ahead of us.  Kind of disappointing.    We were then sat at our table and noticed the menu on their website is a little different than the menu you get at your table. Also they don't even have everything on their menu.  The waitress informed us they only have 4 side dishes.  There were about 8 on the menu.    As far as the menu went, they have a great variety of options ranging from edamame to intestines to brisket.  There is definitely something for everyone.  They have many menu options that a lot of local Korean BBQ places that are not even AYCE offer.  The food came out in a timely manner and the waitress was attentive to our drinks being empty and wanting more sides.    The beef brisket was delicous.  I also loved the popcorn shrimp, the pickled cucumber side, and the yogurt soju!    A few downsides - We were sat across from the entrance to the kitchen and just from a quick glance in the kitchen the floor was dirty and had a lot of debris.  A team member of theirs sneezed across from our table all over a counter and didn't cover his face.  In the bathroom when I reached for a paper towel probably about 15 paper towels came out.    Overall, a wonderful experience.  I mean for $20 you truly can't beat it!  I will definitely be back!",

There's a large selection of meats and cuts to choose from, and it's all you can eat for 2 hours. I didn't retain the names, but you'll find beef, pork, chicken and seafood. Some are marinated in delicious and variably spicy sauces. Grilling your own food on the table is fun and entertaining, although there is a risk to overdo some cuts like I did! I left with the firm intention to return.",

    "text": "Just ate here yesterday and I think they are still in their soft-opening phase. I've been to a couple of Gens back in California and I have to say this place was just alright compared to back home. Then again, I suppose this place would be a better alternative to having no nearby KBBQ places at all lol. The place has that club-like feel with the dimness and blue lights. It actually makes you feel like you should dress up a bit, but who does that for KBBQ?   Anyways, it was cool to find out that they had a variety of appetizers which are included in the $19.95 AYCE dinner price. I tried the agadashi tofu and seaweed salad. The tofu was just alright. It could have used more seasoning and it'd be nice if it was crispier. The shell was so thin and didn't have that crunchiness factor. I'd rather just eat the tofu without the shell since it would be healthier lol. The seaweed salad was decent and a nice addition to the meal since it was refreshing and doesn't really fill you up (more room for meat!).   As for the meats, I would not order their brisket. It literally was the most fatty pieces of meat I have ever seen and eaten. It seemed okay at first, but after cooking them on the grill for a few minutes, the fat began to puff up and the meat resembled marshmallows. I think there was more fat than meat and my poor arteries cried with each bite I took. Besides, that experience, the rest of the meat was okay. The bulgolgi I've had at other places were much saucier and flavorful while this place seemed much drier and tasteless. Their steak is good and I would recommend trying their K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken). It looks like the orange chicken you can get at Panda Express, but the sauce definitely makes it worth it.   The side dishes were typical, but I was sad that they didn't have the thin slices of radishes. The sourness definitely makes the meal much more enjoyable.   The service was actually pretty good. There were people coming about every 10-15 minutes just to check up on my table. They were nice and had a good upbeat attitude which makes a big difference because I've been to some places where you can tell that the workers did not want to be there.  Overall, I would recommend checking this place out for lunch since it is a bit cheaper. If you end up liking it and think it's worth it, the dinner scene is definitely much, much more worth it.",

Not just the meat, but the rest of the food and service as well. Samuel was our server and he did an excellent job making sure we were taken care of. Yuhao was also awesome and super sweet!!! I'm a big fan of BBQ so this hit the spot.  Must haves: Brisket Bulgolgi Beef tongue Premium steak  I love how fast they are when it comes to service and bringing out the food and our requests. Even when we sat down everything (the sides and salad) was prepared already! Their Shirley temple is yummy and they constantly filled our drinks. Gonna try the bar drinks next time... Soju is on the menu heheh.  Awesome spot definitely will bring my boyfriend here!",

    "text": "People I know kept raving about this place, so my expectations were sky high... Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  [Let's start with the POSITIVES]: * Food came out very quickly after the initial order (as in, immediately after the server completed our orders since she used an iPad - or some electronic device - to take our orders to then send to the kitchen). This was AWESOME!  * Meats were fresh & delicious  * Serving size was sufficient for each order   * Beef tongue was the best, and we ordered it about 8 times (and I'm not exaggerating)  [Now on to the NEGATIVES - which could make or break the restaurant for me]:  * Macaron ice cream was $4 each, and they were just OK. Macarons were stale.  * Tables are not good for a large party w/ kids (the max they can fit in the low booths is 6 people). Tall tables fit large parties better, but high chairs aren't allowed  * Initially, we were told by 2 hosts we can have a high chair at the tall tables. After waiting 40mins, we finally got seated, then another host said we can't have high chairs & removed them (which we understand can be a fire hazard, but we wish they told us this in the first place). My siblings then had to hold their children all night as we all ate/cooked dinner  * Ambiance is very lounge-ish  * Pretty loud inside (like a lounge/bar)  * They don't take reservations, and wait could take as long as 30mins - 1.5hrs  * The hosts didn't know how to pronounce Gen & they didn't know what it meant! We asked a couple other hosts, and we were shocked they didn't know the answers as well!  Sadly, I came here with my family of 10 hoping to have a great experience for my Dad's birthday: 7 adults, 1 toddler, 2 infants. I know they tried to accommodate us as best as they could, but the inability to seat all of us comfortably, and the miscommunication between the hosts & servers to us were quite disappointing.  It's a shame it's not as family friendly as we'd hope, and the servers had no knowledge about the restaurant name (nor did they have an interest to ask management for the answer). Their food is good and their prices are really reasonable compared to other AYCE Korean places, so I wish my review was more positive.  I know they're still new, but I only hope they'll make these improvements before it gets worse.",

It has a nice modern decor and high ceilings which makes it really comfortable to eat inside.   Service is great.  We are constantly proud to add more items to our meals or being asked for more water or beverages.  The best meat, in our opinion, was the pork belly Hawaiin style. It s tender, succulent and tasty without any more sauce added.  And the mushroom and Berthoud addition s also very good as that d the only veggie option for the kbbq.   All in all, it s a rather positive experience but not fantastic, so for stars rating.  The food overall was also a four star rating.",

We told them 2...the very small girl proceeded to tell us that they stop serving food at 10pm. They list that they close at 10:30 on the website. I also recall that this use to be later on Fri and Sat nights. We tried to go there tonight at 8pm but the wait was 1 and a half hrs. So we went and had a drink to kill time and went back at 9:30. My question to the Management staff at Gen is, why would you have your hostesses turn away repeat business  by stating to the customer before you seat them that you stop serving food at 10pm? It seems like very bad business practices to me.",

There are also some other options that are for dinner only menu but if you pay a little more you can have it. The beef brisket and beef bulgogi are one of my top faves for all you can eat. The atmosphere for the restaurant is really modern and laid back. The staff is really friendly and I checked the bathrooms. Very clean.

The place itself is quite aesthetically pleasing and the dim lights give a more suave appearance to the modern approach of the interior. Despite it being jam-packed, the food makes up for it. The food exceeded my expectations and I was not complaining about it. The Gen experience was dramatically enhanced due to our server, Alodia. She was attentive to our grills and always checked up on our table (HIGHLY HOSPITABLE!). Her bubbly personality made it even better. She never failed to make our group of newbies laugh.

    "text": "I have been waiting for Gen to open in Vegas for the longest time, so of course I had to go to their grand opening. I've been a really big fan of Gen ever since I got to try it in California, and it is definitely one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants I have ever been to (although this location still does not compare to the ones in California). Service here is alright, it really depends on who you get as a server.  Lunch price is $14.95 while dinner price is $19.95, which is great considering all the choices of meat that they offer.  When I went here for their grand opening, they still needed to make some adjustments, specifically on their grills. Our grill turned off so many times to the point where it got so annoying, but the servers were nice enough to help us and keep turning it on. It probably would've been better if they transferred us to another table though lol.  Anyway, I'm in love with Korean BBQ, so I definitely went back several more times. The time I went with my friends, service was slow. Our server just kept disappearing, and we had to keep asking other servers for help. Same thing happened when I returned with my boyfriend and my sister also. The servers just have a really big problem of neglecting their customers. They should always be on sight, especially since this is an all you can eat restaurant, it's expected for people to keep ordering meat, so there really shouldn't be a reason why I can't get a hold of my server.  Another down side to this place is the location and wait. Although I don't really mind driving all the way to Henderson, it takes 20 minutes from my house to get here. So whenever I go here, I always make sure I'm starving, so it's actually worth the drive. I also recommend going here before 6 or 7pm, because that's the time they start to get really busy and the wait can go up to 2 hours, especially if you have a big party. Other than that, everything else is great. This is the only Korean BBQ restaurant I would ever go to in Vegas, because of their exceptional price and high quality meat!",

They do serve other proteins and a good variety of side dishes. I feel family style of cooking your own food in front of you makes it fun for everyone, entertaining, and good times.   I read that few yelpers have had problem with the service. Maybe it helped that went early before 6pm meet up with friends for dinner. By the time left around 7pm the place was crazy busy. I think overheard someone say easy over hour wait. Early is the way too go. We had wait but nothing crazy like hour. Really from the minute sat down feel like the service we got was nothing but five star. Once we started ordering I was surprise but the raw protein and the side dishes was bam bam bam coming out one after another. It was pretty darn fast our plates was piling up around the grill. Since there was five of us just about ordered the whole menu. The main things I ordered or should say got my AYCE in was the Beef Tongue and Japchae. The only other AYCE Korean been in Vegas is Sura. The last time went they never had Beef Tongue or was out. The Japchae I believe they never offered. Both are right up on top for my favorite Korean food in general. Both were awesome at Gen Korean BBQ House. The Japchae could have ordered that all night be totally happy in life. The gyoza was solid. Pork Cutlet another solid dish. Bulgogi another one of my favorite was tasty. The chicken I would pass on order the other stuff. The dipping sauce found interesting that came with it and suppose you dip it before or once it done. Any case just never worked besides it does take longer too cook then some of the other proteins. The head on shrimp friend order seriously  waste of time. It lot of work just get little pieces of meat and takes forever cook. The pork belly looked good have two different ones on the menu. Friends ordered both. Our glasses never had empty glass the whole time. They checked after round two if need was grill plate changed up. Our server was friendly and no problem separate checks.   The interior was very modern. I had no idea that walked into Korean BBQ. The minute you walk in see  nice open bar area with couple wide screen that can hang out while wait. Or might be able eat there just never walked by but it the first thing notice walk in. Nice high ceilings always plus for BBQ cause so many people cooking can get smoky. Think with the place being packed packed be really loud but not bad and you can have great conversations over dinner with friends. I had no idea the place was outside or part of the Galleria Mall. Honest got lost. Dooh!   The price......Dam! Talk about cheap!!!!!!! I was in shock under twenty dollars. Dinner. Five star awesome. If only lived on the opposite side of town would take advantage of it more often.  =(",

The brisket is cut thicker, which in turn, makes the meat tougher. The garlic smoked pork belly doesn't taste like garlic. Not even close. The KFC (korean fried chicken) is definitely adjusted for American palettes. The sauce on Korean fried chicken is bright red, thick, garlicky and sticks on every piece of the chicken. This is more closer to orange chicken? The only thing I could recommend is the premium steak. Cooked the right way, it's tender and juicy. The only thing we ordered twice was the premium steak. Overall, the experience was very ok. Would I come back? Most likely not.",

They split us up into two different tables with two different waiters. I was very disappointed in the food all of the meat dishes were of low-quality Grade and heavily disguised with many spices and flavors. Now I know what they mean by Kung Pow \"Meow\" !!  The bar was limited which wasn't that big of a deal but the fact I didn't trust the food was. I will never go to this place again!",

    "text": "Use to be my favorite spot until yesterday. Even though it was Valentine's Day and they're trying to get people in and out, I shouldn't have to feel rushed. The waiters/busboys need communication training as they did a poor job last night. I had one busboy ask if he could remove the side dishes in which I gave the okay for. However he not only got rid of the side dishes but removed pretty much everything from our table including tools being used, rice bowls still in use, and topped it off with shutting down our grill. We barely finished our first round of orders at this point. I let it go and simply asked for another waiter to bring us New utensils and restart the grill. However all night they kept taking things without asking. Plates still being used, utensils still in use, somehow sneaking in and turning off our grill. I finally had it when another waiter came by and snatched up my chopsticks in which I kindly told him \"oh sorry boss I'm still using those.\" He snapped them right in front of me and said \"would you like another?\" in a rather annoyed voice.  Like I said I understand it's a holiday but it's hard to eat when things like chopsticks and rice bowls keep disappearing without your consent. I feel the staff need to do a better and clearer job when removing things from the table. To top it off some of the orders came in doubled, took long, or never came at all. My date and I left frustrated and will not be looking to comeback anytime soon which ultimately sucks because it was our favorite spot.",

    "text": "Just finished dinner there, was Delish. We normally eat at Sura for Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, but lately the quality and choices at Sura have been disappointing for the price. So Gen is very refreshing and a welcome relief!!! Not only do the have appetizers, they have an extensive array of meat and seafood options for entrees and the price is much more appealing for only $20 for dinner!!! Kailin was our server and was very friendly and very accommodating. It was our first time so she explained every and recommended what we should try. The roast beef and spicy chix were very good as well as the Kalbi.   I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good Korean BBQ. It's a great price for AYCE and great selection of food and friendly people.",

If you work at a Korean restaurant learn the names in Korean and in English.... Today it took them 13mins to get a sprite and so I got so irritated that I asked 3 times and still nothing so I went to the front and said I don't know how far you guys placed your soda fountain it shouldn't take you this long and as the waiter saw me go complain he sped walked over and gave me the Sprite... They never came and checked up on us so whenever we saw them walk pass us we had to quickly order... PS FOR ANYONE WHO NEVER BEEN IF YOU SEE THE SIDE DISH OUT BEFORE YOU SOT ASK FOR A NEW ONE. The table next to us had their side dish out 20m or so before some one sat down. That's disgusting. I will never come back to this place it's a joke",

Let me start off with the service. The servers were very friendly from the beginning with their recommendations. They would constantly come by and ask us if we needed anything else from new girls to new side dishes. I never felt like I was ignored or unattended too. My servers Seaver and Minju were awesome and everyone should ask for them !   Now my favorite part... THE MEAT ! My personal favorites and must tries are the beef tongue and pork cheek. The beef tongue is unlike any I've tried because of how the taste,texture, and thickness of the cut. Other good choices I tried were the garlic chicken and the galbi.   All in all my experience at gen was amazing and would definitely recommend it to friends . You would be crazy not to go !",

I love how much variety in meats that have and they're very well seasoned. One thing I wish could changed was the serving size for the side dishes. Especially if you have a larger party. Other times we've been there it was 3 or more people and we had to order multiple times for more side dishes. Service was great and were attentive. Tried the macaroon ice cream and it was delicious! A little sweet for my taste though and I'm the type of person that loves sweets but this was a tad sweeter. Would recommend others to try",

We were greeted immediately and our name taken. The wait was about ten minutes maybe less. This place was very busy and as we ate it got much busier. This was a Wednesday night. We were first seated with another two gentleman, but I felt like I was intruding in their loud conversation. Since it was our first time I requested to move to a more private table. I am not always crazy about places that you cook your own food, but i was wiling to give it a go. Drink orders were taken right away. (you know me) (bonus). Not much beer on tap but that is not a deal breaker. Appetizer Popcorn shrimp and Calamari. Both good tatsting, the dipping sauce was real enjoyable having a bite needed to offset the plane-Jane shrimp. Red wine Pork Belly, Thin sliced Ribeye, And Garlic Chicken. There was not a lot of instruction from our waiter on how to use the grill in our table so the meat stuck and ripped when we put it on the hot surface. The Ribeye was good but needed some pre seasoning. Pork Belly was full of great taste marinated well. Chicken was bland but thee was a sauce that was given to dip it in. We finished our meal off with Ice Cream Maccaroons, Strawberry and Mango. Both had good smooth creamy taste and a good way to finish off a meal.   Thank you for dining at Gen Korean BBQ. Overall a great experience, staff was friendly and accommodating. Could have used better instruction on the Grill. Drinks were refilled without asking. Food brought out quick. (I guess if we cook it that process is eliminated in the wait). We will go here again. If you are at Galleria or in Henderson and want a different dining experience than the norm, check this place out.",

    "text": "My friends wanted to give this place a try because they love KBBQ, so I decided to join them. Let's just say that I was satisfied with my experience.  I have never heard of this place and so I didn't have any expectations, but they did make a good first impression. Before entering the restaurant, there's a menu for you to look at. There's was so many things I wanted to try! We haven't gotten a table yet and already I'm craving me some KBBQ.  Atmosphere: Upon entering the Gen, the first thing you see is how the interior is decorated. The design is modern. It is definitely decorated a lot better then most of the other KBBQ places I have been to in Vegas. It's a plus, but I didn't come here for the decorations, I came for the food!  Food: They have a big menu and I was really excited to try a lot of the stuff on the menu. My boyfriend and I already knew what we wanted to order. One of the cons was that some of the items that we wanted wasn't avaliable, such as the Cajun fries and the hot tea. Still, there's a lot of things for us to try, so it wasn't a big deal. The food came in small portions. It allows me to try more stuff before I can't eat anymore. Some items were better than other. I didn't expected everything to taste great, but overall most of the items were pretty good. Noteworthy items includes: Spicy Chicken, Red Wine Samgyubsal, and the Gen Pork Bulgogi  Service: The service started off really great. Our drinks came quickly and our first order of food came out really quickly as well. At one point we noticed that our food wasn't cooking because the food wasn't on, but our server, Lisa, got that fixed really quickly. As the night went on, the service fluctuated. Most of the time we would get our food quickly, but there were a few instances where we had to wait a long time for our food to come out. Sometimes, the food runner would bring over food that we never ordered or bring us food that we have already ordered.  Miscellaneous: Another thing that I want to bring up is that their venting system is AWESOME. One of the things that bothers me about KBBQ is that I always leave with that KBBQ smokey smell and it stinks up my car for a week. But not this time, I was spared the stink.  Overall: I would eat here again. I wasn't expecting the best food ever, considering it was $19.99 for AYCE, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. The food is comparable (or even a little bit better) to some of the well-known KBBQ places in Vegas. I wasn't expecting the greatest service ever, considering that they have only opened for a few days when I ate there, therefore I was very lenient with the service.",

We do go to Korean BBQ 1 a month and have been to majority of the spots here in Las Vegas and we never experienced anything like the heat in this place .",

For example, with a table of 4 they would only bring out 2 pieces of pork belly. It would be nice if they can bring out at least 3 pieces instead.   The staff is ok. It is a hit or miss with them. Some days more than half of them just stand around and talk. Other days they are amazing. I think it depends who is working. They also do not have certain items on their menu. I actually like the California locations a lot better.",

    "text": "Not all Gen are created equal.  Not even all the locations in Southern California are either.    The types of meat, the quality and cuts of meats are pretty different here.  I'll give this Gen an extra star for having more choices of non-marinated meats.  However, the quality of meat is just not the same here.  It's definitely fattier than I remembered it to be, much slower service. Once happy hour hit, the kitchen stalled for an entire 20 minutes for some reason and ran out of rice.     The brisket and roast beef were okay and the most disappointing of it all is, they don't carry any variety of short ribs any longer.  I didn't see any pork cheeks either, plus they ran out of tofu soup and I guess they don't make it after they run out at 9 p,m for dinner.   We left not wanting to ever visit a Gen any longer.  We came, we tried, never again.",

    "text": "Easily the best Korean BBQ in the Henderson/SE area. On second thought, it might be the ONLY Korean BBQ place in the area :P Anyways, this is a very chic, contemporary restaurant; The interior is dim with blue lighting by the sitting area. I would say that the setting is nice for a date or a family outing. I haven't been to their CA locations but its a nice restaurant all around.  The prices are very reasonable, AYCE for under $25 and no choice A, B, C here - $25 gives you everything on the menu. The Red Wine Samgyupsal is to DIE for! This exclusive meat is by far my favorite selection on their menu. They have all the tried and True selections such as galbi, bulgogi, briskets and beef tongue. TIP: Order at least three dishes of the brisket and beef tongue. They give you literally 7-10 pieces per order, like what...That's not even enough to feed a small hamster. So make sure you order at least three at a time ;) The quality of the meat is very good and tastes fresh. The meat is chopped thin and nicely so they are easy and quick to cook.   The service is pretty good considering how busy it is. I've been there 4 times now and everytime it is a packed house. Still, the servers are diligent about refilling drinks and taking orders. To get seated, expect to wait at least 15 minutes if you have no reservations. On a busy night you might wait up to 30 minutes or more easily. Book a reservation if you can.",

    "text": "First of all: I now learn that there is a location also in Honolulu. C'mon!   Second: I need to give 5 stars to the hard working staff at this location! I came with a huge party 8 including my family and their friends. During our wait (you also get the app to check on it), we hung out at the mall (which helps with easing the hangry members in my group). The unfortunate part is that this location only has one type of table to seat the amount of people in my group, so we had to wait longer. The staff has apologized to us, as the large group before us has already overstayed their 90 minute limit. Yelpers, this is definitely something to keep in mind if you are coming in with a huge group!   The waitstaff has been nothing but patient when I got a healthy mix between hangry teens who won't stop obsessing about the edamame and the adults who just kept the all-you-can-eat orders going with their hangriness. The foods could barely fit on our table as we all dined in. But for the price of $25ish of all you can eat? Definitely worth it! We ended up staying for 90 minutes exactly.   Third: I also knocked a star off because I never got to try the much-talked-about Bulgogi Squid (they ran out). WHY?! At least the Spicy Baby Octopus was delicious!",

    "text": "Breaking my habit of 4 star reviews. It's my second time in a week here. The meats are awesome and the service is impeccable. It was slow initially but they were changing shifts so that was probably what happened. After that, our plates were taken away quickly and drinks filled promptly like the first time. Today we had our usual fill of cow tongue, rib eye, squid, octopus, and brisket. The sides were good. Nothing exceptional but I came for the meats, truth be told. The octopus is a bit spicy though. Squid was, well squid. Not much flavor to that sucker. Maybe next time I will put some salt on it when grilling it. The meats here are really good for the price of admission.  They bring the food quick and everything seems automated. Even the check out process.they bring the cash register to you literally, albeit in a miniature way.  The edamame (soy beans) were good and the soup was tasty, not too spicy. It came with chunks of tofu today and not the squash from the other day. We also got the fried chicken and man was it crispy! And good too! You have to try it because it's not your KFC or Popeyes chicken. It's fried twice and REALLY crispy.  I give them 5 stars because the food is great but service is awesome too so all in all I give them a 4+1. I think for the price, food, quality, and service, this place wins hands down. If you want to pay 25% more, by all means, try to find a better one. I don't think you will find one as I have not either.  The service is probably the best for Korean places and among the best for all Asian places. They know what you want before you do it seems. I hope it stays that way and not because of the newness. Not that I am stereotyping Asian restaurants but if it quacks like a duck. Besides, I am one of those guys who grimaces when he sees an ugly baby and can't say it out loud \"man that's one ugly winkly baby\" while everyone else expounds praises. Yeah, if Jerry/Elaine/Kramer/George were real, I'd be in their living room/kitchen all the time.  One bit of advice, get here before 6pm if you can. The place piles on fast. I leave my number and they text you when you should start heading back. I usually mozy along the mall since there is seating for 7-8 people in the waiting area inside and I feel kind of weird staring at people after a while (I run out of expression less gazes in about 5 min....lightweight)",

    "text": "Before going to the Henderson location, we decided to try the Sahara location. For one, it was closer to us. And two, from past experiences, Henderson location is pretty busy. Lesson learned. Sahara location had the crappiest service ever!!!! Every where you turn, there was an employee. I think there were more employees than there were guests. All those employees, and they still couldn't get our business. Three groups were seated before us. Ok, they were smaller groups. Fine. A party of 3 seated at a table that we could've fit on? Wait, why? Ok, whatever, maybe there's a better location for us. I ask the manager how much longer and they said they're getting the table ready right now. But then, a bigger group gets seated before us? And they came in after us? Wtf?! That's when they knew they f***ed up. You can see it in their faces. The hostess started talking on her headset and looking around and typing on her iPad. Yup, we left. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there until they figure out their flow. It's like no one knows what they're doing.  We were so excited for Galbi that we decided to drive all the way to the Henderson location. We hauled our 4 kids (7, 5, 3 and 3m) all the way across town to eat at 930pm. As soon as we got there, you can feel their welcome. Warm and welcoming atmosphere! Thankfully, we only waited about 10 minutes for them to get a booth ready. As soon as we sat down, ordered drinks and the first round of food. Food was cooked and in our kids bellies within 10 minutes from the time we sat down. Waiters and hostesses were amazing!!! Made sure our kids were ok with everything. They brought out forks for them. Their drinks were in a paper cup with a lid on it. They always ask to help cook at home, so they had a lot of fun cooking. We ordered gyoza, brisket and galbi. Gyoza was good, but didn't come with sauce. Little did I know, the sauce was already provided on the table when they sat us. Lol. The brisket was dry, but just use that same sauce and it was good. Galbi.....to die for!!! We loooooove Galbi. That's all we kept ordering the rest of the night. We tried the macaroon ice cream for the first time. We tried the mango, vanilla, strawberry and coffee. All were amazing. A couple were frozen solid, but that's expected. It's ice cream. Lol. I've been to the Henderson location for a girls night out, a date with the husband and with our kids. All around amazing!!! They have never failed me.",

    "text": "Kailin and Terry were great servers. They service is pretty quick and efficient if you know what you want. There's about 15-ish different meats you can choose from, and my favorites were the garlic pork belly and the beef tongue. All the meats come out pretty quick, so you don't end up sitting there for ages before you get to eat. Like other Korean BBQ places, there are the side dishes, but the side dish selection isn't as large as other places. Side dishes aren't too important to me as the actual meat selection, so i'm not too broken up about it.  We had a 15 person party for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, and the only thing that's important when having a large party here is that they do not take reservations. Because of this, try to all be there on time so you can get seated as it can get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights.",

    "text": "Was shopping at the Galleria snd decided to stop by because a few friends said they liked this place and for the cheap price. The restaurant is very big, modernly decorated, has bar area and lots of tables.   We came in around 3 pm, they only had a few tables but we were asked to wait for a table, not a big deal, just a little curious since they had lots of tables open and enough staff walking around. We were greeted by our server immediately and drinks were brought out quickly.   Typical of other AYCE places there are lunch price ($16) and dinner ($22) I think. Dinner you get tongue and two other types of meats.   Only 3 stars compared to other AYCE places because: -No soup and no steamed egg on the menu -No tongue on the lunch menu ( in my opinion tongue is very basic for Korean BBQ, they should include tongue in the lunch price) -They give very small amount of the sides...when I say small I meant teeny tiny...like they are serving barbie sized food - it was annoying having to constantly ask for more sides and waiting quite a long while for re-fills  -They do not offer to change the grill until you ask them to -Meat was ok nothing impressive, even the marinated ones were decent, nothing stood out  A few pros are that: -Server was very nice and friendly -They offer more variety of seafood than other places -The vent sucks the smoke down to the bottom instead of sucking the smoke upward like other places so we did not smell like a BBQ pit leaving the place - this is a great pro if you plan on going somewhere after the meal so you don't have to smell like meats   If you are in the area or watching the wallet this is a pretty good place for Korean BBQ. I personally would rather pay a few more bucks to get tongue, steamed egg and soup!",

SERVICE: 4/5  The wait was a little bit, but it isn't that bad of a wait. The people are also really awesome. Shout out to Jennifer, our server, for being so great. They were always very attentive and were always there to take our orders. I remember coming here with my mom and they were very good about letting her know what the different menu items were since she was only familiar with certain things on the Korean BBQ menu.   AMBIANCE: 4/5 The ambiance of this place is pretty chill. I like the decor and the vibe. There are high tables and booths, which makes the feel of this place even more modern. I think that it truly enhanced my dining experience.   PRICE: 5/5 It was reasonably priced for AYCE. For less than $25 a head, you get great quality and variety.  LOCATION: 5/5 The location is easy to find in Henderson. There is a ton of parking, which makes it pretty convenient to get into the doors.",

But on this experience it was down right horrible. Our server took our order once and that's when we sat down. Our grill was burning black for about 10-15mins after asking 2 times from 2 different people for a grill change. Then finally the 3rd person I asked came back immediately to change our grill. Our actual server never once checked up on us, anytime we needed something we had to waive him down or ask someone else. We had to keep asking for the same thing cause they kept forgetting. So definitely not a great experience, will be considering to just drive to China town for better KBBQ experience despite the distance.",

Bad experience happened first: Ok well all the hype about this place made me wanna try it. If it's good in Cali, then it has to be good in Vegas right??? Well.... The first time I went to Gen, the server and hostess were very rude. I understand it's busy, but we're not giving you attitude so why are you? There were 4 people seated with my group and I'm not even joking, we didn't get our meals worth. Why? The server constantly forgot our food, wasn't always checking up on us, and we constantly had to remind him what we ordered. And since they had a 4 item rule, me and my 4 people group always finished  our 4-items pretty fast. Out of all the limited food we ate, I think that the brisket and beef tongue were good. We left with half-satiated stomachs, because we just didn't want to deal with the service anymore. Food was bomb, really wish I tried more.   I GAVE IT A THOUGHT, and gave Gen another try.   Good experience: LETS JUST SAY BRAVO for taking all the criticism and changing some things! I went with my bf to Gen because he never been, and it was totally different. A cool thing they changed is they didn't have the 4-item rule anymore, we can order as much food as want, glorious! As always it was busy, but not one server or hostess was giving me and my bf attitude, GREAT change. Our server TERRY kept up with our orders, he was very intuitive, kind, and observational. Once he saw that we were almost done with our food, he would ask what we wanted. I ended up trying ALL the delicious food I wanted to try the 1st time: Likes: brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, octopus, salad, potato salad Dislikes: KFC  Overall, it was awesome the 2nd time. Great food with decent prices and small portions because the quality is amazing. I would like if they changed how they swipe debit/credit cards cause both times I've been there, they said my debit/credit card didn't work, but I go eat out at other places and it does -_- I think it's their cashier machine not my card.",

We had to keep asking for status of certain items ordered. No drink refills, not even an offer to refill. While still waiting on food orders to come out, the server asks if we were ready to pay. Once the bill came, we were incorrectly charged but the hostess promptly fixed it. We still tipped. Hopefully the server, didn't expect good tip after giving horrible food service.",

Other than what I had already mentioned, there was an incident during our dining experience where I accidentally spilled water. If I had not waived down a server/bus person endlessly, they were not going to do anything about the spill on the table even though they were walking by our table multiple times ignoring the situation. They didn't even offer a new glass of water when everything was half-ass cleaned. Only the floor was wiped but not the table. The food that had water in them was not replaced or taken away. I know it was my fault to spill the water but accidents do happen and I was once a server so I know what level of service is to be expected when drinks are spilled as it happens more often than not.  I can only see this place getting 4 stars because people that are giving high ratings are not used to going to real korean bbq places so Gen blows their clueless minds.",

The night club aesthetic was a little unexpected but not too bothersome. They didn't have that many choices in soju for being a Korean BBQ restaurant. They should market it with more of an American twist, as it is. My biggest concern was the wait staff. After being asked if we wanted refills, we had to ask an additional two times to get said refills; had to ask three times for more kimchi; and twice for mung bean noodles. This wouldn't be my first choice to head to, even though it's the closest to me.",

First off, we were seated immediately, despite calling ahead and being informed of a 30 minute wait. The side dishes and water were brought within minutes.  Our server, Alodia, was so attentive and understanding of our requests. We had a group of 6 and we really REALLY like the rice paper, she was so great for constantly bringing us the rice paper and sides we needed. In addition, all our meat orders arrived very swiftly.   At one point we asked another server for Hawaiian Steak (which is what it is called at the Gen in my area, but apparently is not the name here) and he tried to guess what we wanted based on how we described it, but it ended up being a meat we didn't want, and Alodia was so understanding and took the incorrectly ordered meat away and explained that the one we wanted is actually called Galbi.   All around spectacular service, this is absolutely our favorite location and best believe we will be making coming to this Gen a new tradition for our Vegas trips.   OH ALSO, the playlist in here is phenomenal, my apologies to the nearby guests for the impromptu karaoke that ensued.",

They need to add poricha (unsure of English sp/translation) but it's basically corn & barley water.  The food is decent too. I enjoy it. The only thing though is their wait staff do not \"mother hen\" you like in traditional Korean restaurants, so you have to basically do your own cooking. Which is fine but sometimes it's nice not to. Also, if you do not happen to know how to cook a certain dish, say squid for example, & you ask your server, they usually respond with, \"oh I don't know\". If you like traditional Korean BBQ, don't go here, go elsewhere. Unless you're just desperate for kimch like I am often!",

I'm not sure what the standard experience is or what is \"bonus\", but we arrived at our table with a number of side dishes already present. Food and service were good, but this review is specifically to pay special tribute to General Manager Juan Carlos. When our pork jowl was 15 minutes late to the table, Juan Carlos personally came over to offer his apologies. Then, because we asked for his recommendation on preparing the jowl, he personally went to the kitchen to grab some kimchi and garlic, and he cooked his favorite preparation for us right at our table! Kudos, Juan Carlos! We will see you the next time we are in Vegas.",

The restaurant was very clean and modern. We were welcomed when we walked in and had about a five to ten minute wait. The restaurant is buffet style with the lunch menu being a little less than expensive than the dinner menu. You can eat as much as you want but you have to prepare the meats yourself on the grill on the table from the menu provided. Our server took our orders and the plates of meats were brought to our table. Some appetizers, however, are prepared for you by the chefs. Condiments are provided for you, e.g., Korean soy sauce, romaine salad, rice, kimchee, cucumbers, etc., around the grill. The meats cook quickly on the grill. The food was seasoned very well. You are allowed two hours to dine at the restaurant. We stayed around 1-1/2 hours and we were stuffed. As this was my first time at a Korean restaurant, I will be coming back. You definitely get your money's worth by going there. By the way, it was just fun in my opinion. I give Gen Korean BBQ House five stars.",

Came on a dinner for two around 7 pm during weekday, we had to wait about 35 minutes so they took our number and texted us when our table was ready. Got there and seated right away, but the service was slow. They ran out of rice! Seriously?! Out of rice! The meat they served were inconsistent, the brisket were either really frozen or super thawed out! We got full on side dishes cuz we were starving and the meat was taking long. Nevertheless the food was tasty, just the service was pretty bad.  The second time around just this past week, I came on a weekend lunch time. Wow we got seated right away, there were three of us, the food came fairly quickly and the food was very tasty. My 6yo even liked the gyoza, fried chicken, and the macaron ice cream sandwich. I will definitely try it again. Hopefully much more consistent just like this last visit. The meat was very good! I ordered: marinated kalbi, miso pork belly, brisket, cajun shrimp, fried chicken, gyoza",

We came here at 11:03 on a Monday night and we were turned away by the hostess. \"Sorry but we stop seating at 11.\" That's fine, but it's not mentioned anywhere on the website or the menu and we were mere mins past 11pm. Is 3 mins really going to make that much of a difference? It seemed like a slow night, so I'm guessing the hostess cared more about getting to close early than taking our business. If they treat potential customers that way I can't imagine how poor their service is when you've already sat down and they know they already have your money.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Also from the pictures and reviews I've seen it seems like they put a lot more effort into their trendy ambiance than they do their food (only 4 banchan dishes at a kbbq? frozen meat?). This is subpar even for $20 AYCE. If you want QUALITY, authentic kbbq and good service you'll find much better driving 10-15 mins to Chinatown area. If you prefer trendy ambiance to an authentic experience and attentive staff then this is the place for you.",

Of course, this Sunday was father's day so we arrived expecting to wait a long time for a table.  This place is PACKED almost every day of the week but especially on holidays - it's worth the wait and everyone knows it.  Surprisingly, we were seated much faster than we had expected!  We had Jaenica (I know I'm spelling that wrong, and I apologize) for a server and she was great.  I think we've only ever had her once before but she still had our usual order memorized.  There was a minor mix-up in the kitchen and we ended up with 3 orders of roast beef instead of 2 orders of roast beef and an order of pork belly but when Shae arrived to deliver the food and we mentioned it to her she hurried back to the kitchen and returned with the pork belly in no time at all.  Our meal was perfect, as always, and we had a great time.  I will say I am a little bummed to see the seaweed salad is no longer on the menu and if there is any way to bring it back I would be thrilled!  That said, putting cheese in the pork cutlet was pure GENius and made an already delicious appetizer even better!  See you all again next Sunday!",

My husband ordered 5 steaks and chowed down on those and I tried more of the marinated meats! The noodles and salad they give you automatically are super yummy! We also ordered edamame and gyoza that were great as well. We loved the experience of cooking your own food so then it's always how you like it. The restaurant overall has a great vibe and we will definitely be returning soon!",

All food is kept in the back until you ask for what you want which is great because there's no tampering with other people's food and most buffets have food sitting out for long periods of time. We tried the regular pork belly, smoked garlic pork belly, steak bulgolgi, and the beef brisket. By far the winners were smoked pork belly and steak bulgolgi. Seong was our server...great service! Prices are excellent and the food is way better than Korean restaurants in Chinatown.",

It's located right in the \"front\" of the mall, which if you're looking at it directly it'll be to your left.   First and foremost, they're decently priced. When considering quality of the food to the price, you'll definitely be able to get your money's worth.   It's very modern inside which is nice for me! I like modern decorations and it's very pleasing.   And they allow you to be by yourself, yes yes I went by myself to kbbq! The nice thing is they don't have a minimum party requirement like a lot of the kbbq places do. It sucks when you want to eat kbbq and NO ONE wants to go with you, but fear no more! They let you here :D   They have a decent menu and everything I tried, which was one of everything was actually pretty good. I went during lunch so I didn't have the opportunity to try EVERYTHING, but next time I will!   Service is meh at best. It was really difficult to understand my server a lot of times and I do understand FOB. My server also didn't seem to understand my requests which made it meh.   They DON'T do half orders, which is a complete shame and I was pretty upset about it. Considering I'm only one person! But not really a deal breaker, just silly that they don't allow you to do half orders.   They did have radish paper, which is only thinly sliced radish, when I went. It was really tiny and pretty crappy. They gave me five slices of radish that were end pieces and completely folded over on itself. Pretty annoying to me.   All in all it's a decent place. We'll see on the next trip how it goes!",

Had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but they had one side of the restaurant empty... Maybe they were understaffed or the kitchen couldn't keep up.  2. The meats weren't marinated long enough.   3. They were out of 2 of the 5 appetizers we ordered. 4. We had 4 different servers... I wasn't sure which one to flag down for drink refills, meat refills, grill change, and the bill.

We arrived around five and was greeted by the hostess rolling her eyes at us. We weren't the only lucky ones that got those rolled eyes too, customers that came after us all got the same. We got sat down after five minutes which was pretty good after what just happened.   First our server didn't want to be there and as far as we could tell the other waitress's near by had the same horrible attitude. They weren't happy and nobody smiled. But here you have an energetic family smiling and being positive until they bring out the food; it was a disappointment. The portions were like for my eight year old, we had to order like the max order over and over just to make something happen.  This place is the reverse of all you can eat (AYCE).  We weren't the only ones complaining about the servings. Then to top things up, we had to remind our waitress for our drinks, refills and napkins.  Then don't let me get started with the busser's; they were just running laps, passing tables with empty plates on them, I had to literally put the plates in front of his way for him to stop.  But they were all like this, this place is far from good.  I can't read anymore of these reviews from this place from people that don't know what real Korean BBQ AYCE is and the service.  To end this horrible dining experience we were asked by our dopey depressed waitress if we were paying cash or credit? She waited until I gave her a response; to eventually have a rude cashier come up to us with a tablet asking me for my CC. I had to double check she actually worked there because she didn't introduced herself or let us know she was going to take care of our bill at our table.  Swipe, signed and was given a receipt then she walked away without saying thank you or anything like she enjoyed her job.  So food was horrible Service was horrible Environment was crappy  Will never comeback again!",

Result was a long walk to the restaurant but that wasnt an issue, it was our bad for parking in the wrong area. Interior is modern and trendy, like every other Gen. i liked the hostess because she was sweet but our server was sort of rude, im kind of bummed i didnt get her name(i wouldnt post it here and put her on blast but for next time if we ever return i would let the hostess know i dont want that server to help us). she wasnt friendly or genuine, and when i asked her for brisket sauce she said exactly these words \"in a little bit.\" and walked off to help another table. i understand we were still waiting on most of our food but we have the first plate of meat already and even the empty table next to us had their sauce tray filled, ours was empty. i didnt want to be that person to just trade it or grab it from another table. anyway, ive worked in customer service and that girl could use some lessons, something like \"sure i'll get that right out for you\" or \"oh im sorry i'll be right back with that\". Food was mediocre, it comes out in tiny plates like tapas so i felt like i was eating at Gyukaku lol. Yeah they have a larger menu and variety but what good is it when the quality isnt there? I have to say though, good choice of music playlist or at least when i was there. Welps, cant say i didnt give this one a chance, from now on I'll stick to Hwaro or the new Doh(Tofu Hut) closer to my location.",

The restaurant is located in front of the Galleria Mall, which is convenient because unlike other Korean BBQ places, you don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown and deal with the hassle of finding parking. The place had a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I did the AYCE and thought the food was just ok. I wish they had more sauces available because the only dipping sauce they provided was a bit too salty. I really didn't like their grills. Everything I cooked stuck to it, and the servers had to change our grill about 7 times because it kept turning black from all the burnt residue. Another thing I really didn't like was having to pay at our table. The server came to the table with their iPad and stood there the entire time to run my payment. It just made things REALLY awkward. I really wanted to like this place, but I'll be going back to Tofu Hut or the other Korean bbq's in Chinatown from now on.",

The loser of a manager with a mountain man flannel (really) comes over and squats by the table to tell us we can't stay because his floor manager won't allow it. Our friends quickly get up and we all walk away!! So disappointed since we had heard good things, BUT I will never be returning to this establishment due to poor quality customer service! Petty as people run this place, it's disgusting. This place deserves ZERO STARS! Everyone knows customer service is what sells the place.",

    "text": "On Monday, my friends and I decided to go and try this new place. We were celebrating our friends birthday. We had a short wait for our table which isn't bad. When the hostess sat us down, she let us know how it worked. Our waiter Kevin came over and went through it one more time and asked if we were ready to order. He kept the food coming and always checking back with us. He was super attentive to the table. All the servers were really on their game. I would definitely be going back and letting my friends & family know about this place. The price wasn't bad and the variety of meats and appetizers were",

    "text": "It's kind of nice to have a Korean BBQ place nearby and Gen Korean BBQ at the Galleria Mall in Henderson is a welcome addition. First off the weaknesses that other diners have mentioned are mostly all True. Service is very good, but who is who in there? It seemed like we had a main server, but then several random people would come over and help us. We ordered our drinks, but the food came before our drinks. We had already started cooking our meats, when a lady came over and asked if we had ordered drinks, we said we did, but it had not arrived yet, but she went and got them in a hurry. Now I am thinking we might get another set of drinks from the guy that first took our order, but he didn't bring them. Oh yeah, we first ordered coke, but the server said they had pepsi, we said that is fine. Then when we were asked the second time and we said we ordered 2 pepsi's the other server said they only had coke. Whatever! we'll take it! (huff!) The meats come at a super rapid pace, they must have them ready and plated in the back room. The classic standard \"Bul (fire) gogi (meat)\" was seasoned properly and the meat was tender for the most part. Lana and I both experienced a fatty inedible \"super ball\" of fat that should have been trimmed off in the kitchen, but they let it go through. The short rib meat (less the traditional bone) was really good. Lana also ordered the steak and she didn't like it, but I did. The table top grill was on full blast and we asked for the power level to be turned down and it helped the cooking process. The inherent drawback of this style of dining is that if you are not paying attention, the meats will not be properly cooked. I hardly took a single bite since I was keeping an eye on the cooking process. The food cooks fast, so take a bite and resume cooking and flipping the meats. The in table ventilation system is as reported, nearly all the smoke is captured as you grill and there is no excessive smoke or odor on you clothes when you leave. I tried some of the suggestions other diners recommended, some were good, some not so good. The agedashi tofu was soft and undercooked, it was just cooked tofu and sauce. The crispy squid was OK, nothing special, some were overcooked and I did get one bite that was delicious, the remainder was hard cooked rubber bands. Towards the end of the meal, I remembered the \"KFC\" (Korean Fried Chicken) and I ordered one to see how it was. The pictures on Yelp from other diners had it as a small side dish, but mine was like a double order and it was not all that great, akin to Panda Express orange chicken with some Korean chili pepper flavoring. The bad part was that some of the chicken was tough and kind of tasted like tough tendons and junk. I had to cover most of it up with my paper knapkin cause it was a gamble to see if the next bite was good or something unedible. I didn't complain about it and I didn't want to be charged extra for not eating everything I ordered. The various side dishes (ban chan) was good, I asked for some extra potato salad, but never got it. (I was getting full anyways). Another server asked if we wanted more kimchi and was said, \"sure\", but he never brought it either. Once again, we were about done anyhow. I noticed some guy in the kitchen slicing away with the meat slicer machine, but that is kind of a bad sign since Korean BBQ meat should take a while to marinate then be served, but it could have been he was slicing more for dinner, so I'll just pretend I didn't see that. The restaurant is very modern and stylish, it's only been a few weeks since they opened so things are clean and in good condition. We only had to wait about 15 minutes to be sat, so that isn't too bad for a Saturday afternoon. The Hostess went through her speech, but she spoke so fast I could not understand most of it, not a big deal since I know the dos and don'ts of Korean BBQ. All day Saturday and Sunday is $19.95 and I guess lunch during the weekdays is $14.95, with dinner prices after 3pm to midnight increasing to $19.95. Pretty good prices for All you can eat with a 2 hour time limit. We noticed one corner table with some big guys having lunch and they surely got their monies worth, they did some damage! Overall very good and I don't need to order stuff to try out next time, I know what to get and what not to repeat. AND they should offer rice to every diner, that is like Mexican food without tortillas! Final note as others had mentioned, we could not get our check! We said we were done so our main server cleared out dishes and he still went on serving other diners. I asked someone else and they acknowledged me, but still no check! I just left the tip on the table and we paid up at the counter. We'll be back again after a while, they still need to get their routine down.",

    "text": "This place is hands down the best place to get all you can eat KBBQ in town. Our waiter Bo, was an awesome waiter! He was very nice, & always made sure to stop by our table often so that we had everything we need. He told me that he felt like he didn't do a great job at serving us, but I disagree. I've done my fair share within the food industry, & know a hard worker when I see one. Now onto the food. This place was very clean organized compared to Tofu Hut or other places I have been too. I didn't even have to question myself whether or not the food was safe to eat. Their sauce to dip the beef in was absolutely delicious. It had a hint of vinegar and sweet soy sauce I believe. Many KBBQ places I have been to don't really have a great selection of dipping sauces (most of them just look like straight up oil). I also enjoyed their salad. My mom doesn't eat rice so we literally ordered like 4 plates of salad with extra sauce (cause that's how we like it). The meat was very good as well! The brisket is always good anywhere you go, but I was surprised they had the boneless Kalbi beef (we're used to getting the one with bones). Definitely get the chicken appetizer, you won't regret it. Also the bulgogi was very flavorful & tasty. I gave them 4 stars because they don't have a desert selection (which I was highly disappointed about), & they ran out of edamame & Cajun fries during the time we went. All in all, definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it. & they have a pretty cool electronic hand held device thingy to pay with if you're paying with a card. I thought that was unique compared to other restaurants I've been to. As you can probably tell I suck at writing Yelp reviews, but since I promised my waiter Bo, this is the best you guys are going to get!",

The orders come out ridiculously fast and the staff is very accommodating, wether for additional food orders or just refilling our drinks. I guess the only down side is that they didn't serve steamed egg (which I always get when I go to a KBBQ place) and they don't have a dessert menu . I hope they make a dessert menu later on. I wish it was open later than midnight also, but overall I will highly recommend this place to anyone who loves KBBQ. This place definitely made it in my top favorite places.",

The food was decent. They kept changing out our grill. The servers lacked enthusiasm and seemed down every time they had to take our order. When we were done eating we reminded the server we needed separate checks and they said they could only split it three ways. I explained that at the beginning of our meal we were all paying separately and he admitted that he did not understand and there was miscommunication and we should speak to a manager. Overall I would give this place a second chance. Hopefully next time the service will be better.",

Keep in mind that around 3pm, it was far from busy. An entire half of the restaurant was empty. Two people from our party ended up being late for our reservation. They let us sit to wait for them. This is where everything goes wrong. While we were waiting, the staff attempted to sit two strangers in the same table with us. We couldn't believe it. The manager also came out and had the audacity to tell us how reservations work and that we've already been sitting here for an hour and that we only have an hour left ( we hadn't ordered yet). One of my friends ended up having to take the manager aside and lecture her instead how costumer service works and that their policies aren't visible in the restaurant. There isn't gonna be a next time. The food isn't all that great either. The appetizers are good but the actual meats for kbbq are bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that's familiar with how quality kbbq should taste.",

Once we were seated the grills had to recleaned, when are orders were placed half of it would come with no one aware anything was missing so we had to continually remind and ask the wait staff where this and that was. Our server was responsible for 9 tables with various party numbers, which was just not manageable. I will NEVER revisit or recommend this place to anyone. By the way don't ask for the Cajun Fries as they are \"seasonal\" as stated by the manager!",
