    "text": "Quickly becoming one of my favorite places for Korean food.  Island Style aka Baek-il-an is a Hawaiian/Korean/Chinese restaurant that surprisingly gets all three cuisines right. I tried the Loco Moco from the Hawaiian menu and it was fantastic. I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with any mac-and-cheese but the ample amount of ban-chan will keep you preoccupied.  If you like spicy noodles, I highly recommend the Bibim-Guksu. Simply the best guksu I've had in Vegas and possibly top K-town California guksu. My friend calls it 'the crackdish'. Yes, you will be addicted to it as well if you're a fan of bibim-guksu.  If bibim-guksu doesn't excite you but you still want noodles, maybe you can try the black bean noodles or jajjangmyun. If you're REALLY indecisive the jjamjamyun is a great choice; one portion of jajjangmyun and another portion of jjam-bong (spicy seafood with noodles) on a single divided bowl.  I'll have to say all the dishes I've had at Island Style/Baek-il-an has been satisfying. It seems a little awkward to have one restaurant host such a variety of different food but if they get it right, who's complaining??!?!!",

This restaurant looks pretty sketch from the outside, and the ambiance inside is quite humble.   But the service was mind-blowing; the waiters who served us were knowledgeable, friendly, and considerate. Their warmth and humor immediately put us at home. I'd say the friendliness of the wait staff was the best part of the experience.  The food was also top-notch! I was totally blown away by the meat jun and pork katsu-- so juicy and flavorful!! The seafood udon and jap chae were also alright. The only disappointment was the bulgogi, which was a little on the dry side. I wish we got to try more of the menu, since all the food ordered around us looked and smelled incredible.  A final plus the serving sizes here are RIDICULOUSLY huge. Great value for money, definitely hope to come here again in Vegas :)",

They also brought us several sauces to choose from and our server suggested his favorite, and I agree! It would be impossible to leave this place hungry, and was also one of the most affordable meals we've had recently. Highly recommended.",

Even though we were only getting take-out, the service was awesome.  Employees were smiling, friendly to customers, and really turned \"just picking up some food\" to an experience which makes me want to try this place again (and wouldn't mind dine in).  This really is an island style Korean BBQ kinda place.  The plates even came with kimchee and mac salad.  Definitely worth going back for!",

I liked how side dishes were served unlike other places I've been to, which I will not mention. Based on their food and service alone, this place deserves 5 stars. Island style has got to be Las Vegas best kept secret since they've been here for a while now and I've never heard of them until today. I will definitely be returning to their other selections.",

The food tastes delicious and comes out on huge plates. Their appetizers are all free and refillable.  I usually get a Cutlet (katsu w/ gravy). They flood it with enough gravy to eat with my rice, which is just how I like it. Also comes with macaroni salad which is pretty standard at Hawaiian places, but I like that their macaroni salad isn't smothered in mayonnaise.  Other than that, I like the loco moco, kalua pork, bbq combo, and bi bim bap bowls. Honestly, everything is delicious here and definitely worth a visit.",

When we walked in, the tables were all packed with huge families and friend groups, showing you that this is a place you share with loved ones.  We were seated quickly and when the waiter came over, he asked if we had any questions about the menu (considering that half of it is written in an Asian language, I'm sure this is probably a concern!).  We ordered the Japchae, Combo plate, and a spam masubi.  A few seconds later, the waiter comes back with all these complimentary apps!  What?!?!  Awesome surprise.  There were boiled peanuts, anchovies, bean sprouts, and radish/cucumber/bok choy kim chee.  I liked the bean sprouts the best; the dressing on it reminded me of seaweed salad.  Then we got our food.  The spam masubi was a nice huge chuck of rice, spam, and seaweed.  The Japchae was a very large serving and it had some out of this world mushrooms and bulgogi in there.  The noodles were sweet and slightly chewy; an interesting texture.  The combo plate was excellent, a great way to try a little of everything so you know what you like.  The BBQ chicken was my favorite, and the kalbi beef was juicy and flavorful.  The Jun meat was not my cup of tea, I didn't like the egg batter.  Of course, I was really excited about the mac salad: very tasty and black peppery.  I have to say someting about the waiter, because he is really what made this such an enjoyable experience.  I think he knew it was our first time there, so he kept giving us hints about what was good and how to eat some of the stuff.  He was sooo laid back, kind, funny, and welcoming, like we were best friends or something!  At the end of the night, the door opened and a big gust of cold wind came in.  My husband, who refuses to wear jackets, shivered and the waiter gave him some tea in a to-go cup to warm him up on the way to the car.  How sweet is he?",

The dumplings were delicious. The dipping sauce was amazing. The combo plate was good. The BBQ chicken was awesome! Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The same goes for the short ribs. I wasn't really fond of the Meat Jun, though people on here rave about it. Didn't pack a lot of flavor and the taste of egg seemed to overpower the taste of the meat.

I haven't had those since \"small keed time\" in Hawaii.  Very nostalgic.  The service is fair, the waiter speaking pidgin.  The food is pretty good. We had the homemade mandoo because we saw the lady making them last time.  The meat jun was on the tough side.  I think the beef needs to be sliced thinner for that.    My main complaint is with the kim chee.  It was slimy and not very hot or flavorful.  I didn't even touch it after the first bite, and I am usually the one to polish the thing off.  Maybe I just got a bad batch, but in my opinion, having good kim chee is essential for a Korean restaurant.  My second complaint, no restroom!  What restaurant in this day and age does not have a public restroom?  I guess the three star or less kind.",

This is a great place to go if you want to get away from the pricey restaurants located on the strip.  Island Style is a hole-in-the wall.  The service is fantastic...the owner is extremely nice...and it is a great value.  Not expensive and you get a nice portion.    The owners love the customers and don't hesitate to go the extra mile.  And if you mention yelp....they love it!  Value + Quality + Friendliness = Great choice for a low key dinner.  But don't expect to be amazed like many of the people on yelp apparently are.  To say this is the best restaurant in Vegas is entirely absurd.",

I love that this place is a hole-in-the-wall also.   The food here is great! Not the top of my list, but definitely worth a visit every time I'm on/near Sahara! I usually get the BBQ Combo, because it comes with a LOAD of stuff, and the Stone Pot (Dolsot) Bibimbap is worth mentioning too. I also like that boiled peanuts and side dishes are served almost immediately after taking a seat.  They also have a booth in Greenland Supermarket! I haven't made my way to that one just yet, but i'm sure they've still got it goin' on!",

Everything I had was well prepared:  grilled chicken, kalbi, and meat jun (okay, maybe the meat jun was a little heavy on the egg, but it was delicious)... just like a great plate lunch on O`ahu.  My buddy's sweet-and-sour chicken wasn't what we were expecting, but it was great, too. The service was friendly and nice.  I was slightly apprehensive about the location, but the apprehension was unfounded. Yelp did not let me down.  I know where to get my Hawai`ian food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I even had them make me a Spam musubi to go... yum!",

There were only a couple of tables open.  We ended up getting our food to-go.  While we were waiting to put our order in, we sat down at one of the tables since the whole place is tightly packed in with the maximum amount of tables they can stuff in the space without breaking fire code.  A server came up to us and asked us what we would like.  I ordered the Meat Jun, hubs ordered the chicken katsu and our 11 year ordered kalua pork and cabbage.  The server asked us also if we wanted a drink and hubs and daugher ordered Hawaiian Suns.  He even walked my daugher to the cooler to show her what they had so she can pick what she wanted.  I had Korean iced tea which I LOVE.  A couple more parties came in and ordered and all got their food before us.  I don't know if it's because we weren't Korean or because they were Korean or if it's because our food was harder to prepare?  Then, another server came up to us surprised like she didn't notice us the first 4-5 times she walked by us and gave us menus again.  We told her that we already ordered.  I thought that was funny.    We finally get our order after about 20-25 minutes which normally I would mind, but we had really no place to be.  The orders were correct and everything was really good.  It was my first time trying meat jun and I think I will always order that there.  Hubs liked his chicken katsu and daughter liked her kalua pork.  She didn't finish it all, but she's a tiny 11-year-old.    I will be back, but I might take my Korean friends next time to see how much faster our orders go through.  Lol.",

    "text": "So we were in Las Vegas for a few days and wanted to eat off the strip. We looked up to see what was on yelp and Island Style came up so we decided to check it out.   We exited the 15 and headed out to the location. When we arrived we asked could this really be the location? The location is in a tiny strip mall. We decided to walk in. What a surprise, the place was really clean and we were greated by a welcoming man by the name of Russell.   We ordered the spicy pork and the combo plate. All of the food was awesome I couldn't choose a favorite. The tea was some of the best tea I have had, Russell was nice enough to show me the bag so I could get some later.   This is some of the best food my wife and I have had. We will always stop here when in Vegas or close by. We even joked that we may have to move to Las Vegas just to be able to eat here.   I am already craving the next trip.",

    "text": "After more than twelve hours on the road in the wee hours of the morning, we were blown away by the owner's [from reading everyone's reviews, he must be Russell] kindness when we stumbled in for a late breakfast / early lunch. Located in a random strip mall, one would easily pass this place up. Luckily, our Yelp app was working [as opposed to not working when we were in the middle of nowhere, Utah], and the recommendations were good ones.  As we sat down, he brought over a few dishes [\"banchan\"] to get us started - pickled radish, sprouts, and kimchi.  When we asked Russell about the unique flavor of the kimchi at the table [it was the \"Hawaiian version\"], he brought out the \"Korean version\" of the house kimchi for us to sample as well. It was just as good as the other version with very different flavors.  When we couldn't decide what to order, he brought us pictures, which instead of helping me out, confused me more. I was hungry, and everything looked good.  We finally settled on the combo and the loco moco. Tasty. Filling. Just what we needed to continue our trek eastward. Near the end of the meal, Russell brought out boiled peanuts for us to take on the road.   If you're looking for something tasty in Vegas that will fill you up as if you'd been at the buffets without giving an arm, leg, and liver up, then this is it.  4.5 stars.",

This is exactly the kind of restaurant I love no matter the cuisine, and Russell serves all sorts of Hawaiian/Korean so very good, scratch that, not good, great.  My only complaint is they are so far from my house.     Every meal comes with boiled peanuts, and I've been served kimchi, and bean sprouts with my meals.  Your glass is never empty and if you are drinking water quickly you'll get a pitcher.  I've had the tea on each visit too and will get it again.     I've enjoyed their combo platter and very hot (both in spice and temperature) seafood & tofu soup.  Experience the food for yourself, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.   Island Style may be a small family run \"hole in the wall\" (a term I use with much respect and endearment) restaurant in a strip mall however has a rare combination of excellent food, warm attentive staff and more than reasonable prices compared to the servings you receive.  So long as I'm live in Las Vegas I'll be a customer of Island Style.",

    "text": "So, I had to check out what all the hype was from the reviews here. My mother and I enjoyed our spicy seafood noodle soup. Very generous portion and prompt and friendly service! I gave 4 stars. I saw a couple of things that prevented me for giving it a 5. I was trying to figure out why some tables didnt get the same selection of banchan. The Korean customers were automatically given the full assortment of banchan as a greeting shortly after being seated and even before their order was taken. We, on the other hand were first asked what we wanted to order then we only got kimchi, radish kimchi and the onions and yellow radish pickle with black dipping sauce. Far less than what I saw other tables had. I guess my amerasian features were mistaken as being Caucasian and my Korean mother from another asian country?  The table across from us had the same noodles and they received several banchan side dishes. Im wondering if the Korean customers are given the full selection of banchan because they expect it so they give good service to them. Ive been to other korean restaurants and it doesnt matter what you order from the menu every table was presented with same banchan. My mother even noticed it and asked me , \" why didnt she give us bean sprouts and the other dishes too?\" The other turnoff was after some customers finished eating and left and before the buser came to clear off the dirty dishes a server went to the table and picked up ONLY the bowl of boiled peanuts and took them up to the front counter area. The front counter is high so I couldnt see what she did with them. I found it very odd why she did not take a few dirty dishes to clear off the table at the same time.  I am wondering if she pulled the uneaten boiled peanuts to be put back into a container to be served again. I've heard mexican restaurants doing the same thing with chips.  With these observations, I wont be making a return visit from the NW anytime soon.",

    "text": "I am not Hawaiian, but I have been snooping around Yelp long enough to realize that there are a lot of fine Hawaiians living in Las Vegas. They have been making their rounds to every Hawaiian eatery and yelping their love. Mahalo nui loa!   I followed their yelpings to Island Style, a Hawaiian/Korean joint. When I set out on my Island journey, I had sundubu and banchan on the mind. I thought it might be closed with I pulled up. They have highly reflective glass, so you can't see inside, but I trusted the open sign and went on in. The restaurant is definitely a little hole in the wall, but very warm and inviting. They have nice wooden tables pushed together to accommodate large parties. When I arrived, there was a family of probably ten eating. They all seemed very happy. There is also a large TV, and they were tuned into March Madness.   I thought I should order from the counter, but if you are eating there, just take a seat. The owner, who is friendly and helpful, came over to take my order. I really wanted a kimchi sundubu, but they only have a seafood one on the menu. I didn't want to be picky, so I decided I would try something different. (Although, he probably would have made it for me. I might try next time.) He started suggesting things, and I guess it became apparent that I had never tried Hawaiian food, so he brought out the picture menu. You know you appear clueless when they have to bring out pictures of the food.  I finally decided on a spicy chicken dish based on the pictures. Just pointed right at it: \"I'll take that one there.\" In the meantime, I got a nice hot mug of Korean tea, boiled peanuts and three banchan. Yum. Yummier. Yummiest! The tea was great. Boiled peanuts are always a welcome treat, and all three banchan were fresh and flavorful. I inhaled the bean sprouts in about four bites. I felt embarrassed ordering banchan refills as a solo diner, but the super friendly server quickly noticed my bean sprout love and arrived with a new serving noting: \"I think you really liked that one!\" I didn't even have to ask! The kimchi tasted homemade with love. I finished it too!  I think they went a bit easy on the spice for the spicy chicken, but that is okay. I hadn't really conveyed an \"I can handle spice\" attitude given my picture-assisted ordering incident. The portion was very generous, and the seasoning was scrumptious. If you are not an onion lover, you might want to avoid this one. However, I love onions, so the onion festival on my plate made me smile, as did my overall experience at Island Style, and it only cost $10!   I am not sure if it is a good spot for vegetarians given the spam and oxtail soup and other meaty options, but you could make a good go of it with a couple of servings of banchan. The thought did cross my mind that I could have been perfectly happy with my mug of tea and my three little bottomless banchan. I am no expert on Hawaiian cuisine, so I can't say it is as good as it gets, but I can say I'll be going back to see what other tasty things I can nosh on!",

They checked on us enough to make sure we had what we needed and it was not to a point where we thought it was too much.  Food was delicious. My first time eating this type of Korean food. I ordered a Bi Bim Bop on a plate verses my coworker ordered hers off of a stone bowl. Beef was flavorful on rice and a lot of veges, pickled cucumber, bean sprout, carrots.. top with seaweed and a fried egg. I was told by the women and man that I'm eating it wrong.

If you're a large group, finding a table shouldn't take too long either.  The restaurant is owned by husband and wife from Hawaii and Korea, respectively. Hence, the Hawaiian and Korean fusion (although the Hawaiian food here is the Asian part of Hawaiian cuisine).  The menu is divided into three parts: Hawaiian/local favorites, Korean, and Chinese. Anything from any of these menus is yummy! I have never had a bad experience here. Oh, and they have a good selection of Hawaiian Sun, for all you kama'aina peeps.

    "text": "I'm giving 6 out of 5 stars unofficially, that's how great this place is!~ Not only is all the food amazeballs, but the service is beyond outstanding and stellar. I mean, talk about an owner taking pride in his business and giving his best. This is a total hole in the wall joint, but don't be fooled by its location or outside appearance. This is Korean Hawaiian fusion at its best!  As soon as we sat down, we were given menus and boiled peanuts to munch on while looking over the menu. Already, we're off to a good start! There is so much to choose from, so just go with what you're in the mood for.  What we ordered:  Musubi: SPAM on top of rice, all wrapped in nori. There is a special sauce in there, quite possibly with a little bit of crack in it. Crack sauce. I love it.  Yook gae jang: there is really nothing better that cures a hang-over than hot, spicy soup. This had all the right ingredients and the perfect amount of spice. I hate that some places skimp on the meat, or have wayyyy too much green onion, or whatever the case may be. But our soup had the right amount of each ingredient, which gets an A+ in my book.  Jjam Jja Myun (Jjajang myun and Jjambbong in a split dish): The best of both worlds! I love both noodle dishes, but hate wasting the food because we usually can't finish it all. But this way, you get half a serving of the Jjajang myun, and then half a serving of the Jjambbong.  Loco Moco: this heart attack waiting to happen is rice, hamburg steak, a fried egg, and then gravy poured all over the top. It's very heavy, very savory, but incredibly delicious! We opted to get our gravy on the side, so that we can limit how much gravy to pour over. I think it worked out for the best, so as not to overwhelm our taste buds with too much heaviness.  Backtrack, I want to give some more kudos to the owner's son. He doesn't even need to say anything, just one look at him and you know that he is a kind and gentle soul who really just wants to provide excellent service to go along with the even more excellent meal. He noticed one of the girls in our group was very sick (she completely lost her voice, we later find out she had pneumonia!), so he brought some hot tea, lemon and honey...without her even asking. I just think that's the kind of service that's hard to find these days -- where they offer to bring or give something without you asking for it first. I really felt like he cared about our experience in his restaurant, whether just the overall experience or the quality and taste of the food. Thanks for one of the best meals we had in Vegas!",

    "text": "This place is my new favorite in Vegas.  Having been born and raised in Hawaii, I have high expectations for Korean BBQ as well as local food.  This restaurant delivered big time.  Free appetizer upon being seated was Hawaiian boiled peanuts.  Haven't had these in ages and they were good.  Boiled the right amount so peanuts are still firm and not gushy.  Ordered the combo (BBQ chicken, Kalbi, Meat Jun) with fried rice.  Arrived in a few minutes complete with an assortment of Korean side dishes.  Portion was extremely generous.  All 3 meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Mac Salad was Hawaiian Style and top rate.  Huge portion for Fried Rice that was ono.  Food total was $19.  Menu is definitely Hawaii-influenced with Oxtail Soup, Spam and Eggs, Chicken Katsu, Kalua Pork & Cabbage.",

So we head down there to see how they have been doing and if they are consistent.   And I have to say......Bomb-diggidy-bomb! So yummy as always and the customer service  (which is the most important for me) is on point!  If i had to point out changes ..i would only say the tea was different. .in a good way..it was boiled barley... versus the root tea they used to have which I loved too.  I love teas so I see tht a small difference.   But as I said..customer service, food taste, and the Otter pop tradition after the meal has stayed the same...  Great job guys...",

    "text": "We drove by this place several times and I'd made a mental note of it, so when we happened to be near enough I suggested we try them out. I've lived in Korea and adore the food and the people have always been more or less lovely to me, so I was excited to find a restaurant that felt nostalgic for my time there. The tang su yuk comes as a mountainous portion of tasty goodness! The meat is crisp and coated in a generous amount of batter. The vegetables were great- the onions were soft and sweet, the peppers crisp, and pineapple made a welcome addition. They give you the choice of having your sauce on the side or poured, we went with poured. Plenty of banchan joined the party with seasoned beansprouts, boiled peanuts, cabbage and cucumber kimchi, a seaweed salad, etc... I got a bowl of jjajangmyun too which came with pickled radish, raw onions and the tasty blackish dip that was ubiquitous at the little eateries I popped into while in/around Seoul. Noodles were springy and the sauce was plentiful. It seemed a popular option among the other diners there during our visit. For the amount of food we had, and how many extras our sweet waitress threw in to our take out bag, I feel we paid a fair price. They have lunch specials and tons of other dishes I look forward to trying. Antho really enjoyed the tang su yuk and agreed that we'll be back.",

I asked the waitress if they give any discount for NV locals since there are other Korean restaurants give special price for locals on the strip. She answered with a dirty look \"We don't do that kind of stuff\". Can't be more rude.   The food was all right. Nothing special. I moved from LA Korea town. Maybe I am too spoiled. If the price is right, I would come back as a local. I will never go back",

    "text": "In Vegas for the weekend and we wanted to eat at a different place. Tired of buffets and fast food.   Wasn't sure what to eat but knew we wanted something different and tasty.   Island Style gives you a array of Korean and Hawaiian dishes.  With the almost 5 star rating o. Yelp, we decided to give it a try.   With the help of their employees, I ordered the Bi Bim Bap dish. It was a rather large bowl of rice, seaweed, one egg, carrots, Chinese broccoli, and beef.  It was very tasty and it a must have! The price for this was $11.95 and definitely worth it. I even had some to take home. If you have a small appetite, this can serve two people.   My husband ordered the Bulgogi dish.  Although it was a little on the sweeter side for him, it was still delicious.  I tend to like the sweeter side of my meats, so we pretty shared our dishes together.  The price of this was $16.95 which also comes with kimchi, picked radishes, white seaweed, picked, bowl of soup  and cucumbers.  He loved the steamed/boiled peanuts which are given while you wait for you food, and had about 3 refills of that.   The establishment is clean and has adequate amount of seating.  It's located at a little hole in the wall place off of Sahara.  Not a fancy place, but who needs fancy when what really matters is the quality of the food.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  What I come back to this place? Most definitely!",

From the outside it was a little scary since all of the windows are blacked out (LV sun) and you can't see anything inside.  I was afraid to go in thinking it was a massage palor.  But as soon as I opened the door, the place was humming with activity - a rather surprising sight.  What can I say about a place that offers not 2 but 3!!! different types of cuisine -- and all my favorites!!!  You have your Korean, then you get the Chinese Korean menu and finally Hawaiian!!! all in one single stop!  The place is run by a family and it appears everyone from the family works there - father, mother and 2 sons (they looked alike).  I'm pretty sure they were Koreans originally from Hawaii -- there's that island infused look they have.     I had the Korean naeng mein and garbi ribs combo plus a spam musubi.  It wasn't the best naeng mein, garbi or the musubi I had.  What makes this place special is that it has a home made feel to everything.  The garbi, definitely was marinated \"island\" style.  I also noticed their Loco Moco and it looked darn good!  I will have to try it on my next visit to LV.",

Our usual order is the Bi Bim Kook Soo with extra meat! Its a spicy cold noodle dish with meat, eggs, & veggies..soo good! If Im not in the mood for that, i stick to the Chicken Katsu..you cant go wrong with that! The portions are huge also! Dont forget the Pineapple-Orange or Guava Hawaiian Sun for your drink on the side! Make it 2, shoot! The parking is a little tight, but all worth it. The family that owns this place are so respectful & kind, they have known us for years because we continue coming back! The service is phenomenal every time! Give it a try!",

Nothing more annoying than to have to always flag down someone to refill something. Food is always on point. I've ordered the bi Bim nap, bulgogi, soondufu before, and have tasted some of the other dishes that others I've done with, and I've not had anything bad. :)",

Both are very good by the way.  They have gotten more staff to handle the added tables and the Hawaiian/Korean stuff is great as always and her sides (bonchon) are great.

I was writing this review while I was sitting down, and the owner comes over and hands my sister and me otter pops...  I had the Kalbi + Soondooboo combo, and it was super delicious.  It was so big... At first I was expecting meat and the soup, but then fish came out, and it was so good... And the taste was absolutely amazing, better than a lot of restaurants that specialize in Soondooboo...  This is by far one of the tastiest restaurants I've been to, and based off of my experience here, I would strongly recommend everybody to come and try it, because they will guarantee, give you the best service and food.",

    "text": "I had a hard time deciding how to rate this not because of indifference on my part, but rather with respect to what to expect. So let's just start with, if you're looking for the full-on Korean experience with dozens of bowls around you and formal, even surly, sullen service, this is not the place. But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you won't be disappointed.  The name says it all: this is Korean (and Hawaiian and, coming up, Chinese/Korean) with island style. The owner (or the husband of the owner couple) just oozes chill; it's practically relaxing just talking to him. And he'll hang out and chat. Even call you \"brah.\" The service overall is personal, informal, and pleasant.  This is a tiny place; it's in a strip mall, and you'd be forgiven for not finding it right away. You have to look hard and hope that you're not being pressed by busy Sahara traffic.  I was on my own, in town for CES. When seated, he first gave me a bowl of boiled peanuts to nosh on. Then came the banchan trio: kim chi, kaktugi (Korean radish kim chi), and bean sprouts. I'm reasonably familiar with kim chi (I make my own occasionally); this was good, although not particularly sour or complex. The kaktugi was great. He then brought out a separate bowl of this radish-green kim chi. This was absolutely excellent; spicy and sharp with a hint of sweet.  I went with the spicy squid; really good. (Not super spicy, but then again, I have a high threshold.)  Cost: around $15 for everything. Really. In contrast to many Korean places. And I left totally full.  Apparently they have just installed three high-intensity burners (they had just been inspected and approved that day), and they plan to do Chinese-style food too, like black noodles. They will also hand-make their own noodles.  Pity I don't live here; it would become a regular place for me. Clearly they have other regulars (one couple came in and the waiter asked if they wanted him to clean their regular table so they could sit there instead of somewhere new). Nice local indie place; that's where I like to spend my money when traveling, and I'll be back here at some point.",

We didnt realize that it was a couple miles from the Vegas strip so we walked to the stratosphere then took a taxi... shouldve drove our car.-_- but once we got to the restaurant, our pain was so worth it. The owners were so nice. The gave us some boiled peanuts, and we ordered kalbi, spam musubi (my friends loved it) and the mul neangmyun/bibimneangmyun combo each. Their bibimneangmyun is really tasty. The ajusshi gave us free mandoo ^_^. The food really was good. The lady makes really good water kimchee- which you HAVE to eat with the moolnaengmyun. um...I think they have soju there too? After stuffing ourselves we asked them to call us a cab, but the ajusshi said he would take us back since it would take the cabs forever to get there. ^_^ Who does that?!! I will definitely be going back whenever I am in Vegas again.",

Not to mention, the servers are extremely polite here! Waters were refilled fast. Always serving with a smile!   I have usually ordered from the Hawaiian side but so far I've tried the loco moco and meat jun on different visits and both are really good. Next time I come, I'll try more Korean food. The only thing I've tried was some japchae which is the noodles, and my friend ordered it but the portion for that was huge! I'm not complaining about that at all!",

Some of the menu can be confusing because they have like two versions of the jam poong. I think one is a deluxe version?  I ordered the regular one I think and it came in a gigantic bowl!  I think that bowl could have fed me three meals. Even though I ordered the regular, it came with tons of seafood including mussels, squid, shrimp and octopus. You can vary your spicy level but I thought the broth was very flavorful. By the time I was done eating, it looked like I did no damage.  I came here with a group of friends so I also got to try the ja jang mein (black bean noodle).  Again huge portions size with good flavors. I also tried the tung soo which is korean orange chicken or korean sweet and shower chicken. The chicken is fried in a heavy batter.  They give you the sauce of the side and the sauce is a thick syrup. A little dip is all you  need.   Service was great, atmosphere is extremely casual and I definitely will come back again!",

We were welcome very quickly by the friendly staff and seated.  I am almost positive that all the staff has a sixth sense--whenever you try to catch their attention, one of them is already on your way to take care of needs.  The two dishes we ordered were black bean noodle and spicy seafood soup. The portions were as big as I remember and the taste was as good as I was hoping. We shared both dishes and had enough leftovers for the next day.  I am so happy that we finally stepped into Island Style and we will certainly come back to try other Korean-Chinese dishes.",

    "text": "Aloha Specialties was temporarily closed, so I asked braddah Nelson Q for a rec of a good Hawaiian place in the Ninth Island (Vegas).  He sent me to Island Style, and I'm glad he did.  IS serves Hawaiian specialties like loco moco & saimin, but they also offer traditional Korean dishes like stone pot bibimbap & mandu.  Its located on W. Sahara & Las Verdes, not too far west from Palace Station.  We ordered pan fried mandu ($7.95 for 8 pieces), large won ton mein ($11.95), fried rice ($11.95), fried saimin w/ spam & kamaboko, and stone pot bibimbap ($11.95).  Banchan is included in the meal.    Sorry, only the mandu, banchan, and bibimbap are pictured.  BTW, come hungry because the portions are big here.  First of all, the mandu were very good.  They were packed w/ fillings, and crisped nicely:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the won ton mein came in a huge bowl, and was filled w/ tons of chewy noodles & mandu.  It was the largest bowl of won ton mein I have ever seen:  4 Stars.  Thirdly, my friend who ordered the fried rice doesn't eat much.  However, he killed the massive plate.  I had a bite and it was pretty tasty:  4 Stars.  Fourthly, the fried saimin was also ono (tastes good).  It had a lot of spam & kamaboko, and the noodles had a nice chew to them:  4 Stars.  The banchan was all very good, with the exception of the hot dog.  My rec would be to grill it longer, or pickle them to give them some uniqueness.  BTW, the kimchee must be good, because some local Koreans bought some to eat at home:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, the bibimbap was excellent.  The portion didn't look that large, but I could barely finish.  Additionally, the dish stayed hot throughout the meal, and the rice crisped up perfectly:  5 Stars.  Regarding the ambiance, its a total hole in the wall.  My friends even wondered if it was open.  Nonetheless, the restrooms are clean:  3 Stars.  Surprisingly, the service was very good and friendly.  They really made you feel at home here:  5 Stars.  Mahalo nui loa (TY very much) braddah Nelson.  Da grinds were da kine (the food was very good).  I was happy to find good Azn food that was not on Spring Mountain Rd.  Its worth a drive from the strip where overpriced, mediocre & fake Azn food abounds.",

We came here for dinner and had an amazing meal! We order a combo plate (kalbi, Korean chicken, and meat jun with rice and Mac salad) and japchae. It was sooooo delicious and the best meal we had during our trip. The banchan was super yummy as well. The food came out very quickly and everyone working there was so friendly!

    "text": "Solid 4 Stars...When leaving the establishment, my rating was going to be a 3 1/2 Stars however the additonal 1/2 star came from our server who gave me boiled peanuts to go. He apologized that my fried saimin was not served to me in a timely manner. We were done eating our fiod and he noticed I didn't have my fried saimin.   Here's my story... let me start by saying I'm from the 808- exit 8 home of the best meat jun in Wahiawa Hawaii. With that said i know meat jun and know how one should taste. The meat jun here is not bad at all. Best so far on the mainland. I think the dipping sauce could've been a little better but hey it's still good.   We arrived here around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy but glad they had large party tables available. We had 8 of us total.   The server was very nice and served the table ban chan and boiled peanuts. The peanuts and cucumber kim chee was the bomb.   In addition to my meat jun order, i had the fried saimin and kalbi. Omg, broke da mouth fo realz. The fried saimin was on point. Lots of flavor and made with fish cake. Yay!   Although they forgot about my fried saimin, it was actually worth the wait. I'm excited to visit again.   After viewing the menu, this is a Korean Restaurant serving Hawaii style dishes. Felt like I was eating food on Kapiolani Blvd back home.   Definitely a place you gotta check out.",

Rusty sold me and my crew from the first minute on the family style dining, we immediately felt as if we were family, to the point that I and my my friend told him to bring is what he liked . Best decision!   The food was amazing. Come with empty stomach and come at closing. He unloads the kitchen onto our table. My chopsticks nearly caught on fire; they never stopped moving for a solid 45 min. The free side plates were amazing and if it weren't for feeling like a complete douche I would have been done at that. Can't wait to return!",

I recall really enjoying the food as well as their company/service but heading there for dinner last Saturday with a friend and my parents, I didn't really know what to expect.   Good food and excellent service is what I got.   I ordered the Combo plate: kalbi, meat jun, BBQ chicken, rice and macaroni salad. I loved everything but the kalbi. Something about it - no other way to describe it other than I've had better. It was cooked, so I'm not sure if it was the marinade or the quality of the meat - but my friend didn't like it as well and my parents didn't even try it.  The service was awesome. Gina was her usual hospitable self and even brought out some special dishes for the table.   Everything was awesome except the lack of parking and the kalbi. If I lived in Las Vegas, I'd be a regular for sure; in time, the duke.",

It's a bit of a drive if you're staying at the hotels on the strip but I will say it's worth the trip.  The restaurant is a mixture of Korean with a Hawaiian flair. The place is simple and no-frills but the food tastes like home cooking and the portions are large. The owner was very courteous and friendly. We had Cha Chang myun, (noodles are made fresh) mapo tofu, and bulgogi which comes with Cham pong (spicy soup) not to mention all the pan chan that is on the house. Our bill came out to less than what we would have paid for one person on the strip and there were 3 of us.  I would definitely go back if we have some time left of our trip. Thanks Yelp!",

Island Style is rated as the #2 Asian restaurant in Vegas...somehow I'm really surprised by this.   Let me jus say that, upon entering the restaurant, it doesn't seem like your typical Asian food establishment. Simple tables and chairs, with a large menu that hangs over the counter. We were quickly seated after confirming we were at the right spot, and served water and some tasty boiled peanuts (that I had never had in my life). Give them a try.  To keep things safe, we ordered the combo (bbq chicken, kalbi, and meat jun). While we waited, they brought us banchan. Colorful dishes of seaweed, hotdogs, noodles, cucumbers, and more. I was IMMENSELY impressed with how much I liked the seaweed...not expecting the sweet deliciousness of it. After some time, the main attraction was brought out. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. The bbq chicken and kalbi (spare ribs) were packed with flavor, but the real winner was the meat jun.  I could eat this tasty, thinly sliced beef wrapped in an egg batter every day of my life and never get tired of it. It was like eating beef wrapped in french toast (which I assure you was really good). Even now I'm thinking about going back. While there was a lot of food from start to finish, it left you full, but not in a way where you needed to contemplate being carried out in a wheelbarrow....simply put, just satisfied.  Nice people and AWESOME food.",

A side of pan fried dumplings had just the right amount of meat inside and just the right balance between softness and crispiness on the outside. Their combo plate - chicken teriyaki, kalbi (beef short rib), and meat jun (beef wrapped in egg) is seriously good value, almost three meals in one.  All in all, super-friendly service, great value, and a deservedly huge local following. A nice hole-in-the-wall restaurant tucked into the middle of a strip mall that's all too easy to drive past.",

    "text": "My boyfriend's uncle discovered Island Style when the clan was vacationing in Las Vegas. We were skeptical of the high reviews on Yelp might have been skewed because of the area and for being a \"fusion\" restaurant, but we were pretty impressed! The owner is Korean and her husband (Russell) is Hawaiian/Japanese, which explains why their restaurant offers a variety of Asian foods.  SERVICE We pretty much interacted with Russell the entire meal, he was easy to get along with and cracked jokes with the boyfriend's dad. This is the type of mom and pop/family service that anyone can appreciate!  FOOD Mandu (Dumplings) - 5/5 They were hand made by the owner and had really fresh ingredients. I loved how there was vermicelli within the meat/veggie mixture.   Pork & Cabbage Hawaiian Plate - 4/5 I liked how the cabbage was shredded and cooked with the pork rather than hour fast food Hawaiian places cook whole pieces of cabbage that hardly get eaten. Add some sriracha and it enhances the flavor of this rice plate. The only thing I didn't like was the macaroni salad, not that best I've ever had!  Korean Cold Noodles - 4/5 My boyfriend got this dish and it was really refreshing for a hot summer night. They give you a pair of scissors to cut the buckwheat noodles yourself and a bottle of spicy mustard (mustard with wasabi?) . I enjoyed a small bowl of it to accompany my rice dish and found it to be very enjoyable.  OVERALL I think we've food another good restaurant pick for a future trip to Vegas. Even though it's off the strip, it's worth a trip out here.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2013 - 54 of 100",

Don't miss trying the combo plate, beef rib soup, and the \"meat jun\". it's like an Asian egg with meat pancake.   The combo plate was tasty but only came with one piece of short rib aka Kalbi. The mac salad was as good as the islands.   We think the beef rib soup was probably the best that we have had and we have lived all over the world.  So get to Vegas and pass on all the strip food. It's way overprice now and head to island style.",

Didn't really know what to expect. The menu speaks for itself as it offers a fusion of hawaiian and Korean dishes. Had to order a little bit of everything from loco moco, teriyaki salmon, meat jun, Korean dol sot bibimbap and to saimin...there were so many more dishes I wanted to order, but my belly had expanded to the max. Service is fast and friendly. Very affordable. There was no wait for lunch on a Saturday. Definitely check this place out when you're in Vegas.",

TASTE: authentic SERVICE: great CLEANLINESS: very clean   After a week of hiking, I wasn't really in the mood to get all fancy and did not want to dress up to have lunch on the strip. I walked in with running shorts, t-shirt, and Rainbows and felt completely comfortable dining here. Island Style felt like a family-run restaurant and I'm so happy I stopped here before the long drive home!   I was super surprised when they brought out various side dishes for us, as I wasn't expecting that at all. The cubed kimchi and Napa cabbage kimchi was the greatest I've ever had and as I'm writing this review, I'm wishing I had some right now! There was also a side dish that came with raw onions, takuan (pickled daikon radish), and a brown dipping sauce that I really liked as well. Dipping the raw onion into the brown sauce magically transformed the onion into something delicious and sweet.   I was really afraid of having food coma on the way home and debated on coming here. I guess I could have gotten a salad, but I'd be way too hungry shortly after. I had the Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bap and he had the Meat Jun. Both dishes were really tasty and the portions were large. My bi bim bap was sizzling as it arrived and the crispy rice on the very bottom was so good! The bi bim bap was packed with vegetables and thank goodness it wasn't oily!!   The Meat Jun was a piece of seasoned pork sandwiched between thin layers of eggs. It was sort of like an omelet, I would say. I had a bite of it and it was pretty good, but it's a lot of protein so make sure you have some vegetables or kimchi with it!   Our server was really nice and even with the crowd, he made sure to refill our waters often. Also, the women working here were very sweet and greeted everyone with \"yeoboseyo!\" Overall, I really liked the food and I would definitely come back!",

Also brought us some kimchi that was really good too.  Food came out quick and hot. good size portion plate. Everything on combo plate was delicious!  Meat Jun is really really bomb, you just need to dip it in the sauce!!  Surprised by the spicy cold noodle dish my girlfriend ordered, wow it was super good!  BEST PART of the whole experience was great service and homestyle family feel.  Russell asked us if we lived in the area and we told him no we had a long drive back home.  He boxed up the leftovers real nice for us and then reached in the cooler and hooked it up with two cold bottles of water for the car ride. DUDE what at nice guy yea?  Thanks again Russell! that little bit of Aloha really made the 9 hour drive home a lot better and my stomach was happy the whole way.  We will be back to see you overtime were in vegas! Mahalo!",

    "text": "Thank you yelp for pointing me to this spot! I took my family there on our last day in Vegas before the drive back to AZ. Quick example of the hospitality and service we received before I review how wonderful the food is...We arrived just before noon and made our way to a corner table next to the soda cooler. There was another patron waiting for her carry out order sitting next to us. While we were looking at the menu, the carry out order came out and the customer left. Before we knew it, Russell came out and insisted we moved to the next table. He was concerned that we'd be uncomfortable from the heat coming off the refrigerator. It may not seem like a big thing, but just the fact he'd go out of his way to make sure we were comfortable before we could feel any discomfort was so refreshing! I read all the other reviews talking about how genuine Russell is, but you can't believe it until you experience it.  Now, the food! After reading other reviews, I needed to make sure we sampled as much as we could and I can honestly say Russell delivers! My oldest son had the combo (bbq chicken, kalbi ribs, and meat jun), my youngest had the saimin, my wife the spicy beef soup, and I had the Bi Bim Bap. I'm am so happy we tried all the different dishes. No one was disappointed with what they got. The food came out fast, hot, and in huge portions. It was everything we could hope for and then some.  One other observation I can't pass up. The place has such a neighborhood feel to it. The dining room filled up quickly after we arrived with locals that were obvious regulars.  It almost felt like a backwards \"Cheers\". Instead of everyone greeting Norm coming to the bar, greetings of \"Hey Russell!\" from the majority of the people walking in the door!  Russell is so inviting and his food is so comforting, I wish him nothing but years of success. I know I'll be back as soon as we go back to Vegas! Mahalo!",

Last person got the stone pot bibimbap.  All fantastic.  The owner was super friendly, and brought us four different kinds of kim chi/pickled vegetables - and refilled them when he brought out our food.   I liked all of them, but particularly liked the bean sprout salad and the cucumbers.  He also brought us gyoza before the food arrived and watermelon for desert.  All for $30.

I think only people from Hawaii would ever become so overwhelmed to coming close to crying when they have food from home. I've been living on the mainland since 1991 and have never found anything as authentic as Island Style.  Starting out with, I believe the owner (he looked like the same man in the newspaper write up), greeting us as soon as we walked in.  Gave us some pupus, and the best part, boiled peanuts. Same style that my dad and his drinking buddies would have when they would come over. Nostalgia.  Two of us had the Combo Plate. Meat jun was cooked just right but more importantly, the meat jun sauce was perfect. If the sauce isn't spot on, it just isn't the same. Kal bi and BBQ chicken was awesome.  My friend had the Hot Stone Bi Bim Bop. Never really saw that in Hawaii but they have it all over on the mainland. Very good as well. She loved it and she spent her hi school years in Korea (Dad was stationed there).  The owner was there working his butt off greeting and serving everyone in the place.  Next time we're in town, we're skipping the strip and making it out here again. Mahalo for making me less homesick.",

(my pop's introduced me to this place.  he knew the owner [japanese guy from hawaii] and his wife [korean]..the two joined like wonder twins and opened up this spot.  the husband has since passed away but the wife is going strong.  i'm not a vegas regular but when i do go i'm sure to stop here.)",

In past visits, I tried the oxtail stew (one of the best I've had) and kalbi. For starters, Russell brought out boiled peanuts and some some really good banchan (kimchi napa and radish, bean sprouts, and hot dogs with white onions). I have never left disappointed with this restaurant in the past 15 years that I have visited Las Vegas as IS is one of must stop visits.",

We discovered Island Style around 12 years ago when Ivan welcomed us the first time we visited Las Vegas with our young children.  Since his passing, we have been greeted by Russell.  He is always very sweet and always makes you feel like you are coming home.  The food is amazing and you get good portions as well.  You are always treated like family when you go there, no matter who you are.  We ordered the Meat Jun which comes with rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. This is a must have.  We also ordered their fried rice, delicious teriyaki chicken and pork cutlet.  Great place to go for that comfort food craving!",

The food and owner were so good that I went back for dinner.  For lunch I decided to get the Combo due to the reviews here. The steamed peanuts were very nice and Russel gave me tons (too many given how much food was yet to come). The pickled radish was great, but the kimchi was a bit bland and squishy. But when Russel saw me eating the kimchi he asked if I liked kimchi and I said yes. He then brought out a large leaf of cabbage and cut it into pieces for me at the table. It turned out to be kimchi that was aged longer and it was wonderful! Nice and crisp with a good bite and more heat.   Then the Combo came. The portions were very generous and I enjoyed everything. I sadly couldn't finish the macaroni salad because I was stuffed. Russel then brought out a bunch of sheets of dried seaweed and I finished them off. They were a perfect light salty ending to the meal. Then when I paid he charged me only for the combo, adding nothing for the extra kimchi and seaweed.  That night I had the Saimin (noodle soup). The noodles were very well cooked with just enough firmness. The soup was tasty, and the small bowl was plenty given that I had stuffed myself at lunch.   If you are a local or have a car when you visit you definitely have to eat here.",

There were two white families at the front of the restaurant that definitely got more service and attention.    Oddly for all the high praises and positive reviews the food was just way off the mark for good Korean food. I'm guessing this is supposed to be a place for non Asians?  The side fishers were either way tooooooo sweet or salty the main dishes ie the combo item was 1. Good size you won't leave hungry which is good but 2. The Mac salad was a salt mine or just plain inedible 3. The chicken and galbi used the same type of teriyaki style sauce that was extremely sweet two.   Will definitely not recommend this place to anybody looking for good authentic Korean food and definitely not good for your health considering the heavy handed seasoning they did on all the dishes how sad",

Let me tell you, the Banchan were not small.  I personally killed the kimchee radishes myself.  Sorry brother.  The Soondubu (spicy tofu soup) came out boiling hot (burn-my-tongue hot).  First time having this so I was quite too excited.  It came with mussels, clams, shrimps, and a side of flavorful fried fish with a small bowl of rice.  I expected the soup to be a little more spicy but it was not spicy at all (for my taste).  Brother enjoyed his plate but was wanting more rice.  I had a bite and the meat was tender and juicy.

    "text": "You know the saying.....you can judge your main dish by how great the side dishes taste.  It's an older generation korean saying about how to judge a restaurant and their food quality.    Of all the Korean restaurants that I've been to, this place has to be the best in town! About 10 minutes from the strip, I highly recommend coming here for all your korean OR hawaiian food cravings.   Of course being a Yelpy, I found this on my phone app and noticed their great ratings by a lot of people.  Since bf loves hawaiian food and I absolutely need my kimchi fix at least once a day, this sounded like a perfect place to satisfy both our cravings.    Don't expect anything fancy.  It's located in a ghetto strip mall with nothing so glitzy like the strip.   But don't let that fool you!  I was skeptical about how their food would taste like when both the server and the owner were NOT korean.  However, once the big slab of kimchi came out along with the other side dishes, it was game over.   Even my mom was very impressed with the way they make their kimchi.  Then again, even my bf who doesn't EVER eat kimchi actually ate it!  Now that's saying a lot about how great and awesome they prepare their kimchi.   My favorite was their radish kimchi.   We asked for more to take it back to the hotel with us!    Oh yeah, haven't even said anything about the main dishes yet.  lol  My mom and I shared the hot stone pot rice with veggies.  (dolsot bibimbap)  which was surprisingly good.  I especially loved the little pieces of marinated beef on top of the rice.    BF got the meat jun which he thought was very yummy.  He gives it 5 stars!  We also shared the fried dumplings and I loved the crispy won ton skin!  The overall experience was very positive and satisfying.    This is our Must Go to place in Vegas!  The owner said his wife makes EVERYTHING herself and they also have another restaurant inside the Greenland market nearby.   Wish I can have her kimchi recipe.  I miss it.   I hope this restaurant stays for many more years to come so I can come visit whenever we're in Vegas!",

Great friendly service and delicious Korean and Hawaiian food that just screams out home-cooking. They provide boiled peanuts in the beginning on top of the regular banchan! There's also barley tea at times.   This place is pretty nostalgic for me. It popped my soon dubu cherry and I've been a fan of the dish ever since I tried it here! The owner is super friendly and unique with his Hawaiian-style hospitality. I haven't seen the son around recently but he used to work there and would pimp out my mul naengmyun with greens and spices! Good 'ol days.  Lately I've been going there for the mul naengmyun. My boyfriend loves the jjajangmyun there. They expanded as well, taking over the Hawaiian souvenier store next door. Some of the tables have become a cafeteria style where you may end up sitting next to strangers. I think it's kind of cute and nostalgic.   Island style is definitely a local favorite, having been here for so long and providing consistently awesome service and delicious food. My only gripe is that it's more expensive than most other Korean restaurants I go to but you know what to expect here. There are also TV's for your viewing pleasure. All in all a great family restaurant.",

Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables. 2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it \"Hawaiian\". 3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me \"brah\" or asking if I \"hang ten\" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.  How does it stack up?  Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.  Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.   A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.  A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.",

The eggs competed this meal with the brown gravy. I highly recommend this place, the price may be a little steep but they give you huge portions.

My mother wants kimchi jjigae at least once a week and since the time she has \"retired\" from the kitchen, we have been on a hunt to find the best jjigae in Las Vegas. Our search ended at Island Style.  This wonderful little mom and pop restaurant is owned by a nice couple that welcome customers in such a warm and kind way, that I truly feel as if they are happy to see us. We are treated well from the time we walk into the door and are greeted, until we leave and they thank us for coming.   My mother and I almost always order the super yummy kimchi jjigae; however, we have veered from our usual and have had the naengmyeon, which is also delicious. We love that Island Style makes their own kimchi and, although it is not advertised, it is available for purchase in various sizes. I am unsure of the exact sizes as my mother brings in her own jar and asks them to fill it up.  Another standout, in my opinion, is the duk mandu guk, which is small pieces of rice cake in a clear broth with mandu and egg. And, although I have not had any items from the Chinese or Hawaiian portion of the menu, I see other diners order from that portion of the menu and that food looks yummy as well.   The food is consistently good and the service is excellent!   Enjoy... the kimchi jjigae!",

    "text": "You know how they say some foods can evoke memories/feelings/nostalgia? Well when I'm craving Korean food and missing the time when I studied abroad in Seoul back in college, I come here. This place is half Hawaiian & half Korean, and I think it's obvious that I usually come for the Korean side of it. I can only speak for the Korean food, but one day, I'll probably try the Hawaiian food side.  First off, they have water, hot barley tea, and cold barley tea free of charge. There's also the same banchan every time. The slightly salty boiled peanuts to start, kimchi, bean sprouts, etc.  We usually get the jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) and the yookjaejang (hot & spicy beef soup). This last time, we also got the  half order of steamed mandu/dumplings to go with it.   The black bean noodles come with the classic onion, pickled radishes, and black bean sauce. The sauce is perfectly sweet, thick, and savory while the noodles are cooked well with some bite to them. It really brings back some fond memories for me, so I'm always down for a big bowl of warm, homey noodles.   The yookjaejang is probably the best I've had so far in Vegas. The portion is enormous, but I'm almost certain it's for 3-4 people. It comes with rice on the side, and in the soup itself, there's strips of beef, green onions, clear glass noodles, etc. The broth is very flavorful with some depth to it.   The mandu comes in a half order (4) or a full order (8), and you choose either pan-fried, deep-fried, or steamed. We got the classic steamed, and these do not disappoint. There's plenty of filling and the sauce with it is your classic soy mix. It's steamed perfectly- not dripping from condensation but also on the over side of the spectrum, not too dry.  All this food for 2 people is more than plenty. We took home about half of the food, and it could feed the both of us for another meal or two.  Overall, if you're craving Korean food, this is a good place to go. It's very flavorful and everything is cooked perfectly.",

A guy outside, smoking a cigarette says \"we're closed, last call is at 8:30\" I didn't know restaurants were run like bars. I told him \"well maybe they should change the hours on the door\" and he came back with \"I'm the owner, I can do whatever I want.\" My husband tells him \"is it really that necessary\" and he says \"just leave before I knock your a*s out,\" as he walks into the restaurant with his cigarette as you can see in the pic.

Outside of the loco moco and the spam and eggs, i'm not quite sure this is a Hawaiin spot.  But has Hawaiin food nontheless, so I digress.   Upon entering, the eating space is open and just tables and chairs.  The kitchen is hidden by a ghetto curtain behind the register.  But what I did notice was that the customers here were greeted like family.  I'm sure that they aren't all family but there was hugging and \"nice to see you again\".  At that moment, I felt like this was gonna taste like some home cooked meal!  I asked if they had bottled coke....with sugar cane, and she said yes.  I was happy to hear.  Cause if I will be drinking coke, it will be the healther option.  I ordered the spam and 3 eggs meal, Jacob ordered the fried rice, and JoJo ordered the kalua pork.  Mine, like I had imagined, tasted like home cooking!  It was good and tasty.  Not the best, but still - home cooked!  I got my coke, but it was not bottled.  It was can!  I asked, \"I thought you had bottled coke\"?  She mumbles something and I said \"excuse me\"?  She mumbles again and I gave up and said thanks.  Overall, good experience and good food.  Would come back.",

Not only does Island Style serve killer Korean food, but you can also get Hawaiian food, or mix it up. I ordered a salmon teriyaki with rice and mac, which was delicious and huge. The Salmon tasted great, unlike many places in the desert or elsewhere for that matter. My favorite thing that came out though was the boiled peanuts (one of the banchan dishes)-- those were amazing. The peanuts were so good and came out so fast that I didn't even notice or care that the restaurant is as basic in terms of decor as it comes. When the food is this good the decor does not matter. I had so many leftovers that I'll get two more meals out of my lunch.",

I used to go to this place with my Korean friends and family for naeng-myun and other Korean dishes. Today, there was this non-Korean, Hawaiian (I think) person working and was absolutely rude! I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand there were a few orders ahead of me and by looking at everyone else's food, it does take time to cook. After 15mins passed by I asked the guy if it would take long cause I only had 15 mins left to eat and go back. He did said he would check on it then left. Approx 10 more minutes passed by I gave him my credit card so it would be faster if I ate and left. He told me that it takes time to make my buckwheat noodles and that everything was made to order. Ughhh.... buddy I'm Korean and I know damn well that it only takes 30 secs once in boiling water to cook the noodles and put in the broth. Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left. The guy who took my order grabbed the checkbook from me and told customers next to me 'shes telling me how to cook brah...'. I know you've been cooking for 19 years BUT if you knew anything about customer service you do not talk shit when I can clearly hear you, grab the checkbook out of my hand, and give me dirty looks. Everytime I came here its the owners that now operate the one at Greenland. They are soo nice and helpful... total opposite of this guy... oh yea btw your Nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in broth) and Bibim gook-so (spicy, cold buckwheat noodles) is tasteless...   If this guy didn't offend me so much, I would come back for their Hawaiian plate lunch, it looked really good. Not so much for the Korean food, I wish the Korean owner or son would've been there :(",

The day was cold, dreary, and rainy. The service definitely brightened up my party's day.   I am always craving Korean food and was looking for something on this side of town to meet Katrina M. for her lunch break. My sister and I got there early, so I took the liberty of ordering for everyone. Our very enthusiastic server, and most likely owner, came over to point out some suggestions. Combo plate ($9.90) comes with rice, mac salad,  kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken. Sold, you had me at kalbi. Everything else was an added bonus. Chicken is one of those meats that can be dry, boring, and rarely the highlight of a meal. At Island, it definitely is a contender. Juicy and flavorful. The meat jun was intriguing. A thin slice of beef that has been thrown in an egg batter and browned. It is the first time I have ever had this and it was my sister's favorite off the plate. Brown rice is an option on their menu. We got it subbed instead of regular white and there was no charge. Bonus points! We had also got the bibimnaengmyeon ($9.90). A cold buckwheat noodle tossed in a spicy sweet sauce with radish, cucumber, half a hard boiled egg, and beef slices. I am glad they keep this even in winter. I am usually all for seasonal specialties, but forget that when it comes to this dish. In Korea, this item usually disappears once summer is over. Luckily, not here in Vegas. We had also got the seafood soondubu ($8 something). Bubbling hot, large chunks of tofu, plenty of seafood, and a raw egg dropped in. All good signs... but no kick. I love it best when it possesses a spiciness that can only be remedied with a spoonful of rice. All the dishes come with beansprouts, radish, and cabbage kimchi. The last two items had the same issue, but they were fresh.   Everyone vowed to come back and try some of the other dishes on the large menu. Even after lunch, I was eyeing the loco moco for next time.   Hot tea is also complimentary. That is worthy of a mention as well.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp we dropped by Island Style on a recent vacation to Vegas.  We were looking for a highly rated and affordable place off the strip and my wife and I love Korean so we decided to give this place a try.  Once we arrived we almost turned around as there were no other customers in the restaurant and it always seems odd to me to eat in an empty place.  But it was Monday so I expect that it is traditionally a slow night, especially for places away from casinos.  I am so glad that we stayed.  Russell is a great guy and he welcomed us like we were eating in his home.  I ordered a combo plate with short ribs, meat jun and chicken and my wife ordered the bibimbap served in a hot pot.  Russel kept bringing out plates of food, some which come standard like the boiled peanuts and kimchi, and other dishes which he just offered on the house.  He brought bowls of soup, dumplings and hot tea.  Pretty soon our entire table was covered in plates and I was in heaven.  The food is simply prepared yet it all tasted awesome and was very satisfying.  The bill for all of this food, soda and hot tea was less than $20 so I gave Russell a generous tip since I think he gave us about double the food we were actually charged for.  I hope that he stays in business a long time because we will be back the next time we are in Vegas.",

Between the Hubby and I, we tried the combo plate (kalbi, BBQ chicken, meat Jun), hamburger steak, macaroni salad, mandoo, kim chee, daikon and bean sprouts. They were all outstanding. And Hubby likey very much. Kim chee never tasted so fresh and I don't even like bean sprouts.   I cannot tell you enough how friendly Russell is. And who gives you extra mac salad? He does!

    "text": "One of a must in any Korean community is the existence of a good jajangmyun and jamppong restaurants.  This is because, unlike most other Korean foods, these dishes are very difficult to replicate at home.  Many good cooks can whip up a good dwenjang jjigae, ddukbokki, or jun, and even more can fire up a kbbq or jungol on their portable gas grill that every Korean family owns.  But trying to perfect the sauces that are the catalysts for these two noodles so that they taste just like the ones from the old country, that is a monumental challenge.  For this reason, jajangmyun restaurants that make great sauces are known by every Korean in that community.  In Vegas, apparently there is Island Style.  I guess to non-Koreans this is a Hawaiian place?  But in the Korean community, this place is known as Baek Li Hyang, a Korean-Chinese restaurant that serves up Jajangmyun, jamppong, and tang soo yook (sweet & sour pork, Korean style).  They also have other Korean dishes, one of which I noticed is the beef jun.  We were here specifically for the noodles, and thus ordered a dish of each.  Expectations were high because we heard consistently that this is the best Chinese noodle restaurant in the valley.  As a result, disappointment was also high as we realized that it was not going to meet those expectations.  First the good.  Jamppong is pretty good.  The soup has that requisite taste required, and the ingredients were ample with fresh and plump seafood pieces.  The deep red color is accompanied by an equally deep taste, although not quite as spicy as it appears.  Now the mediocre.  The noodle on both dishes were just okay, not as firm and chewy as it should be indicating it's not handmade.  Take note, noodles are a big differentiator in these two dishes.  When they are not proper, it will \"tire out\" the dish.  This will result in the symptom where you will initially like it, but then find yourself not finishing the dish.  It was such here.  The bad is the jajang sauce.  It was too sweet, and did not possess that distinct taste required to qualify as good jajangmyun.  The combination of that sauce with the noodles made it at best an okay dish.    The bare set up did nothing to enhance the experience, but the servers were pleasant.  While the Korean-Chinese dishes we had were only mediocre, I'm wondering if there is something that they to well since the place was decently busy.  Maybe I will give it another go on some of the other dishes... But based on what we had, I can't do any better than 3 stars.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Absolutely fine to eat by yourself here, both the atmosphere and the dishes are set up for it.",

Atmosphere: Very friendly atmosphere. The waitress was eager to help with menu suggestions and describing each dish as it came out. The owner would also stop by frequently to chat, check on how we were doing, and to make sure we knew how to eat each dish because we were new. It was clear that the owner got a lot of enjoyment out of feeding his customers; he even brought us complimentary iced tea and hot tea to make sure we had the full experience and helped us cut up our meat because my boyfriend's wrist was in a cast. Service couldn't have been better.",

We were served by this really friendly guy and although we didn't get his name, he told us his wife owns the restaurant. He recommended a bunch of dishes and ended up giving us a plate of deep fried mandu on the house! Turned out to be a ton of food for three people but that didn't stop him from giving us extra servings of mac salad. Towards the end of our meal he also gave us bottled water and otter pops for free.

The portions are big, plentiful side dishes, and a vast menu, consisting of Loco Moco, fried rice, spam & eggs, to traditional Korean dishes like Bi Bim Bap, spicy tofu soup, and Kalbi.   Last time I was there, I intended to get take-out. The staff greeted me warmly and saw that I had a grocery bag with me as I looked at the menu. They politely suggested I eat there, and offered to keep my milk chilled in their side fridge. Is that awesome or what?!?! I did end up eating there, ordered the Bi Bim Naeng Myun/Kalbi Combo, and took most of it home. How great was that for them to offer?!  Service I received both visits were great, very friendly, and the staff always thanked and welcomed the customers back soon when they got up to leave.   This is a no-frills casual hole-in-the-wall.

So when a Korean person says this place is good, then you know it's good. The wait staff is super friendly and it's like they are family. They served you boiled peanuts while you wait, which is super tasty. The panchan (side dishes) changes day by day. My favorites are the bean sprouts and the Kim chee. They add a refreshing kick in between your bites of hot food. I ordered bi bim bop in the stone pot. The meat, rice and vegetables stayed super hot throughout my whole meal and I had to wait a good 5 minutes for me to even take a bite. The rice at the bottom of the pot gets crispy and adds texture to the meal. My bf had the combo plate which came with kalbi, meat jun and teriyaki chicken. All the meat was tender and full of flavor. We were both super full and happy. Definitely one of the best Korean spots in town.",

The bare-bones dining room was also a bit surprising to me, but the food is solid.  COMBO PLATE: This three-meat treat will set you back about $16 but is easily enough food for two. The kalbi was my favorite, while BF preferred the meat jun. Sides of mac salad and rice are plentiful, and you also get the banchan (mostly spicy/pickled items this visit). MANDU: Pot stickers, available in half (4 piece) and full (8 piece) orders, either pan-fried, deep-fried, or steamed. The fried versions were soggy but the dipping sauce is tasty. SPAM MUSUBI: I love this dish, but not here. Entirely too much rice, and such minimal sauce as to render it nonexistent. It's sad when L&L makes a better version.  Service was attentive and pleasant. Menu has a lot of options, but you can easily get a filling meal under $10/pp here. All the Korean customers around us were only eating jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) so maybe that's the best dish to get here. I'll have to try next time.",

I try to not to eat out as much to stay healthy, so my options are limited, decided to get Korean food and found Island style on yelp.  This place is located at the middle of a line of shopping stores, it will take an extra second to find it but not hard following the gps.  Also since it is in Vegas, all the windows got black screens to block the Sun, so you wouldn't be able to look inside, I had to double checked the sign few times before I walked in.    It is a little warm inside but it is in the middle of the summer in Vegas.  The waitress gave me 2 menus and when she found out that I was eating by myself she was surprised and started to talk to me.  I told her I visited Korea a while back and how much I loved Korea, she told me to find a Korean girlfriend and move to Korea. Very friendly and funny, then I decided to get the cold noodle soup.  The soup was really good, almost as good as the one I had in Korea.  Since I been back to the States I tried few the same dish in different locations in California but they were a bit disappointing.    I really want to try the black beans noodle but I will give that a try next time.  Actually there are many items on the menu that I want to try.  Great food with friendly staff, I will come back for sure.",

It was very dry and the sauce was so thick like it looked really unappetizing as if someone actually puked. I am talking about the texture of the sauce and the noodle combination. Horrible. I ended up not eating.   What's worst? Our bill was $21.51 and I had put $25.51. Never got my change back. Were they really expecting that I am going to tip them $4 for the service that wasnt even offered? I got so pissed on top of my food end up tasting like shit. I went up to the register and asked for my change. They already closed my check and had put $4 in the tip jar or the register. HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS?  I am seriously not coming back here ever again.

    "text": "Annyeonghaseyo!  Cheat day approved. We always feel hustled at all of the high-price-point Korean restaurants in town. Out of all of the ones we have tried since moving to Las Vegas, Island Style did not let us down. You seriously get a ton of food for your buck and the food actually tastes good. If you are looking for a small portion, or tiny bite, this is not the place to go.   You will not even believe the portion sizes here. HUGE. Even the banchan (Korean side dishes) were a generous, heaping serving. My boyfriend and I came here with our massive appetites and we were totally defeated. We ended taking home over 60% of the food. That's nuts, even for us. We decided that when we return, we will only need to order one combo plate and share it.  We really enjoyed the authentic Korean banchan selection. The salt boiled peanuts were shockingly delicious. I'm really obsessed with munching on those tasty little guys. Everything else was seasoned and pickled just right; tangy, slightly sweet, and not obnoxiously spicy. They offered - kkakdugi (pickled daikon radish), kongnamul-muchim (bean sporuts), kimchi (pickled cabbage), cold seaweed, and also my absolute favorite was the addictive cheonsachae with mayo (white crunchy kelp noodles). Flavor rating: 5//5  My boyfriend ordered the meat combo plate that was about $12 - Its a crazy amount of food! It comes with 1 Kalbi rib, 1 meat jun, 1 thin breast of BBQ chicken and a big scoop of macaroni salad. We also substituted the white rice for spam fried rice. My favorites were the meat jun and the spam fried rice! We never had meat jun before, but it was so delicious! It's a seasoned hamburger patty covered in a tasty egg batter. The fried rice also had a bunch of spam. The kalbi had great charred and grilled flavor, but 1 rib didn't offer up enough meat; more of a tease. Also the grilled chicken was a tad bland. Flavor rating: 4/5  I really wanted something warm and comforting: a hot and spicy soup would hit the spot. I had my mind on ordering the Soondubu (hot and spicy tofu soup) but I later discovered that they only carry a seafood version, which I was not feeling at the moment. Our waiter was kind and recommended that I try the Yukgaejang (spicy beef and vegetable noodle soup.) I appreciated his tip, so I went for it. It came out steamy hot, the broth hit the spot. It was slightly spicy and very comforting, yet, it wasn't proportional; I wish there was more noodles, after 3 bites I was left with all veggies, some dry meat and a ton of broth. In the future I would definitely  request for extra, extra noodles. Flavor rating: 3/5  The SKIP list:   * Spam musubi - The spam was sliced paper thin and there was way too much packed, dense rice. I ended up peeling off over half of the rice. Also, the dark, savory and sweet sauce to enhance the musubi was missing. Flavor rating:1/5  * Pan fried mandu, it came out soggy and the filling was exceptionally bland. Unfortunately, the dipping sauce didn't do much to enhance it. Flavor rating: 2/5  ~Gamsahabnida!",

    "text": "Talk about a hidden mini mall gem...  I always have to concentrate every time I come here since all of the mini malls look the same on this side of town.  The menu is a happy eclectic mix of Korean, Hawaiian Korean and most recently Chinese. I personally have never ventured to the Chinese part of the menu so you are on your own with that. I come here for the Hawaiian-Korean food and nothing else!   First off they hook you up with a tray of boiled peanuts as soon as you sit down. I'd come here just for the boiled peanuts during football season.  They also provide you with 3-4 plate of ban chan that also have a Hawaii flavor to them as well. One of the non-traditional ban chan that is one of my favorites is the chopped hot dog and onions. I remember eating this all the time when I was a kid.. It  strikes a chord with 8 year old Pat. The rest of the ban chan is your typical Korean fare consisting of kim chee variations and other pickled goodies.   My default order: Pan fried mandoo a custom mixed plate:  Kalbi, Meat Jun and Chicken Katsu . The rock star of the combo is the Mean Jun! Great meat to egg ratio and killer sauce! I can say that their Meat Jun is my favorite in the valley! On occasion the lady gets the Jajangmyeon (hope that's the right spelling) which is    This place has become our default Hawaiian-Korean spot.  Go see Uncle Russell and fam to satisfy your K-808 cravings  Aloha   -P",

The hamburger for the loco moco was tasty too! They also have the good kine kim chee. It's hard to find good local hawaii food that actually taste like it does back home.

    "text": "Hubby and I stopped in here for a \"snack\" and were surprised to see that it resembled more of a home-style Korean restaurant than an \"island\" (read: Hawaiian) joint.  It was late, maybe 1:30 and they weren't busy at all on a Saturday.  We were quickly seated and given menus along with iced barley tea and boiled peanuts.  We eagerly fell on the peanuts while perusing their menu.  So............I hate to do this to a joint that's so highly rated and with such friendly people but..............  My food came after an appropriate wait, not too long but not particularly quickly either, oxtail soup and spam musubi.  Hubby graciously persuaded me to start eating so I dug in while he snacked on the ban chan and peanuts and tasted my food.  No mac salad, no cold noodles.  After another while longer, we noted two, three other tables seated well after us getting all their food and chowing down together.  We gave it a few more minutes because maybe different kitchen zones were less busy than others.  Finally, we had to flag someone down.  The guy said he would go check on our order.  This part is what peeves me:  I know the temptation to cover up is great.  But I really don't like it when people don't come clean.  Apologize and tell me you forgot the order and I'll most likely forgive you because you were honest.   But don't tell me \"Your order will be out shortly, it just takes a little while.\"  A few minutes later, I see through the window, the cook transferring dark noodles from point A to point B.  They plain forgot about the cold noodles AND the mac salad!  They didn't even acknowledge the mac salad after we got the cold noodles.  We gave them another few minutes and then just had them cancel it and they were like \"Ok.\"  The food is good and the people are nice which is why I'm still giving them three stars.  But it wasn't busy and there was no reason that not even the mac salad was a no-show. No regrets but probably will try other places next time.",

We are here at Island Style and to be honest, a girl ain't mad, lol. This would be my second time here. Exterior, for some they might look at it be like what f*%! Is this place? But someone like myself who have seen many \"Hole in the wall\" \"mom&pop\" restaurants like this...think? I bet they got some bomb authentic food in there hahaha what? Let's just say, don't judge a book by its cover, okayy!!! Haha  You walk in, pick your seats...waiter will come with boiled peanuts, water and order any additional drinks. Following the waiter brings out multiple side dishes, kimchi, cucumber kimchi, cold bean sprouts, and I'm not too sure what the last one was  but it was good.   I ordered the spicy Korean chicken, The chicken came sizzling on a hot little cast iron dishYum. Boyfriend ordered the meat jun. De-lish! On my first visit I ordered the fried rice omelette. Friggin' HUUUGE portion. Holy sh*t the omelette could at least feed three people. Lets just say that I have never had anything bad from this little gem  I shall return one day and try something new. And you all should go and try it too....",

The pan fried mondoo was very good... and the bon chon was great.  One of the better things I liked was the ko chu jun that was brought out... it was pasty and delicious.  Too many places nowadays bring out sriracha and try to pass that off as Korean hot sauce... not here... they give you the real stuff :)",

There was no L & L those days, so we'd have to make the trek all the way up Sahara to get here.  Short story long, no matter strong my craving, it was tough to get here and it was lost to memory.  Fast forward to 2010 and, thanks to Yelp and Misti Y, this place is back on my radar.  It's still a haul from my hood, but I HAD to give it a try.  Walking in the door was, well, strange.  It looked and felt completely different.  Gone was the darkness (not sure if they even turned on the lights back in the day), the drink cooler up front and the booths.  Apparently, three renovations makes a difference.  Anyway, enough with the memories and down to business: the food.  There were four adults and two kids in our party, so we took the big table up close to the counter.  We were readily greeted with boiled peanuts and juices for the kids (it was pretty amazing to watch how an entire can of juice can make kids bounce of walls).  We were also brought never-ending dishes of different types of kim chee, which always seemed to be empty when I looked for it.  The mandoo was especially tasty, definitely not the kind you get from the market.  Our meals were onolicious and no one left hungry or a plate empty.    I like this place, but it's so far out of my normal eating radius.  I hope to be back before another 16 years elapses.",

Then like as if Russell reads minds, he brought us over a kimchee soup to try- that was pretty good and I gotta order that sometime when I'm feeling like soupy.

My friend and I were the only white folks in this 20-year old restaurant, and got some weird looks from the regulars. Imagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear \"Korean,\" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place. Upon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine. We ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate. We ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry.  The waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy. Both dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food.  Nothing to write home about; good solid food. I would be happy to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "The food was fantastic. I had teriyaki barbecue beef. It was thinly sliced (bulgogi style). The texture was so soft. It wasn't the pre-chewed cheap Chinese beef soft, but really tender good-cut-of-steak-tender. The teriyaki flavor was perfect. It wasn't too strong. It was only 11.95 and they included the traditional Korean appetizers.  The kimchi was the best kimchi I've ever eaten. It wasn't too fermented, but instead had a great spicy, pickled cabbage taste.  A lot has been said about the service. They are extremely polite. They aren't especially attentive and you can end up waiting between refills or struggling a little to get their attention if you need something else. I did appreciate that they my friend and I right in front of a TV playing March Madness (probably because we're obviously American).  The great food compensates for everything else. I will definitely be eating here again the next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

It reminds me of back home in Hawaii when boiled peanut was eaten so frequently that it was pretty much a staple already.  Hawaii-style Korean grubs done right.

We ordered the cold Korean noodle and their mixed BBQ platter which consists of the short ribs, meat jun and chicken breast.  You can tell they take pride in their BBQ as each piece was grilled to perfection.  I really enjoyed the meat jun (Seasoned ribeye dipped in egg before pan frying) especially with their dipping sauce.  The banchan (free refill) that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner/server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go.  We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt.  All this for $20, not a bad deal at all.  We will definitely be coming back to try out more of their menu items.       ________________________________________",

One Korean lady got a call through my husband, and I could tell her what I want and as well as take out option  I'm impressed! They put noodles in separate box, as well as Jjajangmyun sauce and another separate Jjamppong sauce. And Danmujee, onion and Kimchee in separate mini box. All look great and so glad noodles was separately packaged- and were great after traffic jam home!  I started having Jjajangmyun and already I am  too full with generous portion!   I called to say thank you for great take out, but no one answered. I'll definitely try some others next time.  Love their food! Wish this location is close to  where we live. Maybe next time I'll visit with a bigger belly! Thanks for making me feel great, eating great- I badly wanted great taste, even thought I wish I'm in Korea for those food.

I can't think of a time when anyone went so far out of their way to make sure we felt so welcome and were so completely satisfied with our meal and dining experience.  Beyond that the food is 110% authentic, amazing and delicious.   We ordered a mix of Hawaiian & Korean dishes but every meal here starts out with complimentary Banchan and Boiled Peanuts. It's at this point you know your meal is gonna be something unique and special.  Appetizer -   Spam Musubi: Perfect Hawaiian guilty comfort food. I like to think of it as Hawaiian Foie Gras. :) Not the absolute best version I've ever had but still very good.  Entrees -     Hot Rock Pot  Bi Bim Bop: Perfect searingly hot bowl of rice, veggies, beef, sunny side up fried egg, chili pepper paste, served w/ a little bowl of sweet soup on the side to cool your throat.  Teriyaki Hamburger: My wife's choice for lunch and though it seemed a  pedestrian choice for such and exotic and extensive menu, she enjoyed it very much and I count her as a burger snob so it must of been good.  Side -   French Fries: Again my wife's order and they arrived hot, crispy and fresh which meant they didn't have a chance.  No trip  to Vegas from now on will be complete unless we make it here for at least one meal while we're in town. It's that memorable.  Go now and enjoy. The combination of food, service and the charm of Island Style are unmatched.",

    "text": "Surprisingly, I have never heard about this place till one of my friends told me about this place. This place has been in Vegas for about 17 years (give or take) and have never heard about it till now! I'm from Hawai'i and I haven't heard about it from my fam and Hawaiian friends that live here. I only found out about it thru a friend (who's originally from NY). Maybe I use to go here with an ex and I just blocked it all out from my memory. Lol.   it's a small place, and easy to miss when your driving down sahara in traffic and all the construction. Once we got there, it was not busy, a quiet relaxing place to have a meal. They got a wide screen tv w/ the basketball game on.   We were greeted and served by the owner. He got the pidgin accent. I love that, always make me feel like I'm back home. the menu is simple, that's good for people like me who can love everything on the menu and have a hard time deciding what to get.   This is the first place I've been to that has fish jun! My favorite Korean-Hawaiian dish is meat jun, but I wanted to try this. I'm the adventurous type so I always like to try new things.   I like the appetizers here. It's different than other Korean restaurants. They got the kimchee, pickled potatoes?, and some other ones. They were all soooo good! I couldn't eat a lot of it, so I stuffed the rest in my take out box hehe. My friends didn't care for it, lucky me... I had it all to myself!   I appreciate it when the owners are able to serve and chat a little bit with us. it seems humble.   I told him I love meat jun, but this is the first time I've had fish jun. He said the next time we come in he'll make zucchini jun for us, right on!!! it's not on the menu.   The meat jun is pretty good, but Soon's meat jun  in salt lake, Oahu, Hawai'i tops my list. but this will be my go to spot for anything jun in Vegas.   Oh yah, I like that they give a delicious tea at the end of your meal, no charge. :)  One con is that it's a bit of a drive for me coming from east Henderson. maybe that's another reason why I've haven't heard about this place.  They've got other locations in Vegas, but this is the one to go to. Others have tried the other locations, and all said it's not the same!",

We came here after a friend suggested a buffet at Terrible's and my boyfriend and I were not in the mood for ANOTHER buffet.  After about 3 minutes of scouring the internet, we found this place.  Score.  I was a little worried at first because of the hole-in-the-wall look on the outside with reflective windows.  I thought it was closed at first but I was dead wrong.  I walked in there was wall to wall Asians everywhere.  Good sign.  I had the Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop and my boyfriend had the Meat Combo over rice.  It was a great change up from what we normally do in Vegas.  If you have a car, it's just outside the strip and easily accessible.",

But, if you're here for some great food, then take a seat; you've come to the right place.  Remembert that, despite the name, this is mainly a Korean restaurant so, like most such restaurants, they brought out several small plates of assorted goodies.  I quickly polished off the three spicy dishes, and then decided I'd better slow down.  The waitress came and pointed at the empty dishes.  I thought she asked if I was done, and I said yes.  But then she brought out three new servings of the spicy dishes!  Oops, I guess she asked if I wanted more.  Then our orders arrived.  We had the bulgogi and the hot stone bi bim bap.  Both were outstanding.  I also had a spam musubi to try their Hawaiian food.  It was good, but nothing special.  A little light on the sauce, I think.  But that's okay, their Korean food more than makes up for it!",

This dish was pretty good overall but I would have passed on the teriyaki chicken.  I was really happy when I asked for a grilled fish but a small portion, the lady owner offered to make me just 1 grilled Corvina for a low price.  Sure!  And yummy mini grilled fish it was.

He was extremely friendly. By the time my food was ready I felt like I was talking to my uncle. My second visit I ordered the Meat Jun. Not as good as Hawaii meat jun but since I live in Las Vegas this is as close as it gets.   Extra stars for the fact that he remembered on my second visit that I like a side of siracha hot sauce. More stars for the fact that when I opened up my take out bag there was a surprise: boiled peanuts! Too bad Yelp will only allow me to rate up to 5 stars.

The owner, Russel, was closing shop early that day due to a catering gig. We were super lucky to find the place and get there in time to relax and hide from the midsummer heat. On that particular day in Vegas, it was over 110degrees outside and we didnt have AC in our car. All of our sodas and bottled waters were on the house. He fed us like kings, suggested what he thought we would like and then cooked us even more food for free. The whole time he laughed with us and tried to get us to interact with the only other family in the restaurant. He was absolutely the sweetest. Russel took the orders, made all of the food himself., entertained us and prepared for his catering job all at the same time.  When he flipped the sign on the door to close, a man (he explained an annoying regular) came in sometime after and tried to make him feeling guilt for closing early. The terrible man kept nagging, \"Why don't you want to feed my wife?\" Russel fnally yelled at him and kicked him out. It was great. I wish all restaurant owners and workers were able to deal with horrible and demanding customers in such a way.  We can't wait to go back! Russels spot is a Vegas staple!",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas with my husband.  He was in a meeting all day so I took a Uber and ventured out on my own looking for a good Korean place to have lunch. I had the black bean noodles and spicy seafood soup combo.  They are hard to find in MN.  It caught my eyes because I can have both dishes I one order.  The soup had large crab leg unshelled which I have never seen at other places, not even in Chicago where I grew up.  Had jumbo shrimp and so many seafood variety.  Black bean noodles were so fresh.  Served complimentary barley tea and abundance in side dishes.  Upon requesting for take leftovers she added rice bowl for free with many side dishes without additional cost.  The service was tremendous.  I was making a mess with the spicy soup so the owner brought a bib and gave a free Hawaiian frosty after.  Wow, it was worth the venture.  I didn't try the Hawaiian food but others who were sitting next to seem to woo and ahh.  Really enjoyed the food and great and generous staff!",

    "text": "This is definitely my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Vegas. For awhile I was hooked on getting their meat jun dish that's served with mac salad but exploring their other dishes has had me excited to come in as often as I can!  There are two big reasons why I love Island Style: #1. The service! Jody is the sweetest and most caring server I've ever met. He always remembers your order and greats you with a warm & welcoming smile.  #2. The freakin' banchan! If you don't know, banchan are small little side dishes that are served during your meal. That's an amazing bonus. They have the most amazing house made kimchee! Don't miss out.  For food favorites, I highly recommend: -hot stone bimbimbap -kalbi ribs -loco moco -spam musubi -sweet & sour shrimp   -cold soba noodles  On top of having an amazing Hawaiian menu be sure to explore their Chinese options!",

Do yourself a favor and get it in the clay pot. Especially when it's cold out. The radiating heat warmed me thoroughly. Besides the usual little sides which come in abundance, I was offered Oksusu-cha aka. corn tea. Delicious.  So super friendly and welcoming. Don't miss it.",

We came to day and by all means the place was not packed like we are used to seeing it. First the lady saw us come to sit and asked not to sit there that the table was for a larger party. Little did she know right behind us we have more people coming. She then was like oh ok. She brings up peanuts and leaves. Never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Goes on and helps a different table and leaves us there. 10 minutes goes by and she's going around asking people if they want re-fills. At this point we go up to the lady at the register and asked if we could get drinks. She seemed bothered said said something in her language to the other and still no drinks. A while longer finally the come to take our order and wasn't very kind. Needless to say we ended up leaving. The food is always great but after being treated the way we needed. We weren't able to stay. For my 8yr old to say the lady wasn't nice. This tells you something.",

I was completely wrong, their menu which is two sided (Island favorites/Korean) was not too much nor too little, since I've haven't tried Korean food beside Korean bbq I decided to be adventurous and try out the Korean side. I ended up choosing the jampong?? (Spicy seafood noodle soup). I had no clue what it was but like I said today would be adventurous... not only was the bowl of soup HUGE it was delicious with just the right amount of heat!!! It also came with tangsyuk which is sweet and sour chicken on the side... also delicious but only had a few bites of it due to the size of the portions. Also tried on fried Mandu again delicious... overall this place completely took me by surprise and help me find a love of Korean soups... can't wait to try other selections!!!",

    "text": "Been coming here on and off for the past 25yrs. It used to be more Hawaiian style plate lunches because the guy that opened it was from Hawai'i. His name was Ivan. Ivan had the biggest smile and was full of energy. I will never forget that first greeting from Ivan as my 2 sons and I walked in; \"Eh, howzit brah? Sit anyplace you like.\" He would sit with me and my 2 sons and just talk story. I would bring my family 2-4x a week. Ivan would throw in a few extras and always treated us like house guests. I need to make mention because I miss him, he became a friend. He needs to be remembered. Gina (his wife) is from Korea. Gina made all the ban chan from scratch. Unfortunately Ivan has since past and Gina met another guy from Hawai'i, Russell. Russell has the same personality as Ivan. Very talkative and friendly ... Good for Gina! Hawai'i guys are, Ka 'oi ae!  Anyways, menu still has some island flavor to it but now the Korean offerings dominate - in a good way! We ordered 2 Bi Bim Bop hot pot - 2 kalbi plate - 1 bulgogi plate - 1 chicken katsu and a cheese burger w/fries for the kids. Bi Bim bop - I added Korean hot paste and it was silence until it was gone. No need talk, just grind'um be'fo get cold. Crunchy veggies, egg yolk melted all over the sweetness of the grilled bulgogi and the hot pot crisping the rice to perfection. WINNER-WINNER!!! The ban chan was very flavorful and fresh. I luv the cabbage/cucumber Kim chee - no fishy smell or  flavor.  Boiled peanuts - if you from Hawai'i, you knowz wat I'm talkin 'bout! YES-YES-YES!!! I was to busy eating my bi bim bop without coming up for air, I truly forgot to taste the kalbi ribs and chicken katsu. When I did remember, I looked up from my bowl and all I saw were empty plates (only bones left) and smiles, I knew they were satisfied. Bulgogi came with my order and it was moist, soft and tasted like it should; Sesame shoyu grilled with a hint of sweetness. Bias, yes I am. Did I ever have a bad meal here? Yes I did. But they always made it right! Food and service - especially if Russell is working - are truly worth coming here. Especially if you're looking for authentic Korean food offerings.",

I have been dining here for multiple years and haven't had a bad meal here yet. The servers are very very friendly and prompt. The owner is often present helping out on floor when needed. This establishment closes a bit earlier than its competitors. Parking is very limited and might have to park a block away and walk over. Most entrees are accompanied by your complimentary standard Korean \"banchan\" side dishes. The interior and furniture / fixtures can use a bit of a facelift but most of the returning guests that dine here aren't there for the aesthetics. Definitely recommend this place to friends and family.",

Now I do love Korean food but tonight I wanted beef stew or curry or katsu. I got total Korean instead.   I did line the boiled peanuts and the banchan. I got my favorite soondobu and it is about 50% larger than a regular place so it was just right.   However this is supposed to be a Hawaiian Restaurant so for that it is three star. For Korean restaurant I would give it 3.5 or 4.   The problem is that the service is just not great.  Nice people, good food. Too busy for decent service.",

I've been craving meat jun and boiled peanuts and got a double score when this place had them both! All the appetizers were delicious especially the kim chee. The mandu was also really good.   After we put in our order, the table next to us received hot stone dishes with eggs over easy.  Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good.   The meat jun meat was really tender and had great flavor. Although, I thought it wasn't quite authentic since it had batter plus egg. I've typically had it with just the egg.   My husband got the spicy noodle soup with beef and vegetables. The noodles had great flavor and the base had the right amount of spicy.  I would have knocked it down to a 4 because of the Meat Jun, but the service was so good that it bumped it back up to a 5. He was even offering otter pops for dessert.  Aloha!!",

Much to my dismay, the tofu dish was pretty bland. I could tell that the vegetables they used were the frozen bag assortment of Chinese vegetables. Not very authentic at all. But I should have known coming into a Korean restaurant. Also, the portion size was way too big for one person- such a waste :/   3 stars because I think if I ordered Korean food it would have been much better.",

I loves the spicy tofu seafood soup.   The most popular dish is the combo plate, which includes teriyaki chicken and teriyaki short ribs, rice, fried eggs, and macaroni salad. The meat is marinated in a sweet teriyaki sauce and is cooked over an open flame instead of a grill. Other Hawaiian specialties include fried mandu, a cross between spring roll and wonton and Spam Foo Young, an egg concoction made from, of all things, Spam, a popular staple in the island.  The service was good, I will come back with my family to try some other things on the menu.",

We ordered beef tang soo yuk, jja jang myun, teriyaki BBQ plate and mul naeng myun.  Beef tang soo yuk was crispy and hot when I bit into it.  The sauce was awesome.  Jja jang myun was cooked perfectly.  The noodles were al dente and the black bean sauce was very delicious. The teriyaki BBQ plate was sweet and savory.  Mul naeng myun is always cool and refreshing on a warm day.  Have good amount of parking.  Will be back here again when we are in LV.",

The veggies taste fresh and crisp cooked just enough to hold the flavor. I was truly taken a back.

If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine.   There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink.   I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling.   Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!  I had made this rating a 4, and changed it to a 5. Because now that I'm writing this review, I want some more good food and good service.  Nice work guys!!",

The owner/host is super friendly and makes you feel right at home.  First you get hot tea, warm boiled peanuts if they have any, kimchi, and a couple other korean appetizer munchies. ... and you get a LOT of it (and it's all free!). The owner is quick to notice if your little dishes get low, and will bring refills and send you home with more if you want.    I have tried and recommend the eggs, rice, and portuguese sausage plate, the fried rice, and the meat jun plate.  happy eating :)",

    "text": "Peas and Carrots.  Bevis and Butthead. Somethings go together well.  Korean and Hawaiian don't in this case.  Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 16 quad tables.  There are 8 of them side by side in the middle of the room so you can put several parties of 8 easily, so it's group friendly.  The menu is mainly Korean, but for some reason, they choose to put the word Island in the name of the restaurant giving me the impression they were Hawaiian.  We had the BBQ combo and the Pork Katsu.  I was looking for the Hawaiian aspect, but ended up with a Korean aberation of Hawaiian food.  The katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce.  The pork katsu was over cooked and dry.  I suspect the cutlet was under a heat lamp i.e. precooked like a mickey dees.   The Kalbi and BBQ chicken were good.  The meat jun is coated with egg and like the cutlet, I seemed like it was a heat lamp item too.  It didn't have that freshly made taste.  I was disappointed after reading the good reviews.  If I come back, it would be for the Korean food because the photos on the wall look really good.  Maybe they should change the name of the restaurant to Seoul Style to give the customers a better description of what you're going to get.",

We ordered the bimbo bop, the Kim chee fried rice, the saimin, loco mock, and the oxtail stew. All the dishes were simply scrumptious. I thought the food here was better than some of the local places in Hawaii! If you want excellent food, and a caring server, this is the place!",

Got the kalbi  and this much mentioned meat jun.  I started in on the kalbi, tender, well-marinated, very satisfying, but really loved the kimchee and the diced pickled radishes that were served first.  Then tried DH's meat jun.  OMG!  This is a new flavor and texture for me AND it was fantastic!!  Thinly sliced ribeye covered in egg that was fluffy that you dip into a teriyaki sauce.  The owner came over and added some bean sprouts and ate everything for under $20!!!  Worth the cab ride off the Strip.",

He shakes your hand and treats you with the utmost respect.  He always gives the island talk to my son and makes him feel specal.  I would recommend anything here.  Hot pot bi bim bop, meat jun, fish jun, chicken catsu, combo plate..........whatever.  It's all great.  I've had a couple of their soups and they are awesome.  Their kimchi is the best I've ever had.  I've had a lot of kimchi, and most of it has a little too much of the off/fermented taste for me.  His is just right.  He uses the same process for his radish to.  Their loco moco is fantastic and the brown gravy has just a tiny amout of sweatness to, like it should.  My son loves the spam musubi here, he'll eat it til he is sick.  Me, my wife and son will go here and eat til we are stuffed and it costs us $25 to $30!!!!  I will go by sometimes on the way home from work and get their kimchi, sprouts and macaroni salad to go just to have them at home.  A couple times he has refused to charge me for this because we are loyal customers.  I end up having to just lay a $10 on the counter and run out.  Russell understands what the word \"customer\" means!!  I would recommend this place to anyone that likes island food.  LONG LIVE ISLAND STYLE!!!",

So much flavor and cooked perfectly (not overdone or underdone)! Definitely dip the meat jun into the sauce!  Next time I want to try the Jjajangmyeon (black bean noodle), the mandu (korean dumplings), and the Naengmyeon (cold noodle) which is always so refreshing in this HOT Vegas weather.

Not only was the combo amazing, but the Saimin was to die for too. He served us Korean Polygonatum tea, which has a mild and  unique toasted taste, but this time he also offered a whole sour kimchi plate that was incredible and super flavorful.  Our favorite is still the beef jun, which is a lightly breaded thinly sliced beef steak with flavor to spare, it simply melts in your mouth.  You cannot get better service anywhere else, Russell is simply the warmest and most generous restauranteur you'll ever meet, he really loves to share his island cuisine with everyone, and not only leave with a super full stomach, but we leave happy as we just had visited a friend's home.  Island Style is unique in every way, and you must make it a stop in Las Vegas... It sure beats buffets, because you never leave hungry, and they take real good care of you!",

I might go back and try other dishes before I completely write it off, but I wasn't impressed.  Ordered: -Combo plate w fried rice -Mool naeng myun (cold noodle) -Chili japchae  The combo plate was the best bang for buck. The galbi, meat jun, fried rice were all good.. not amazing. Mool naeng myun was terrible. I usually don't order it unless I'm really in the mood, because I haven't found many places outside of Korea that can make this well. Unfortunately, I happened to be in the mood for it. Sometimes I can tolerate it by adding vinegar and mustard to cover most of the taste. This one didn't taste like much of anything even after adding the mustard and vinegar. Probably one of the worst / bottom five.  We ordered chili japchae which we thought was regular japchae with peppers to add a kick. Instead, it was stir fried onions and peppers, which confused us. It tasted like a thai dish I've had and was pretty good, but not what we expected at all.  The kimchi was good, so I wouldn't mind buying this to-go.",

The staff were very courteous and gave us complimentary peanuts and tea as we waited for our orders. They even came around to check on us and refill our drinks (remember we're a to-go order there really is no obligation to serve us).  The food was good. Meat jun was eggy and delicious, the meat was pretty tender and flavorful, and the kimchi was strong and funky. There was plenty of rice and for the price and location this was a good cheap lunch.

It also has the best service I've experienced since I've moved to Las Vegas. I took my (white) boyfriend here and prior to eating here, he never had Korean or Hawaiian food before, so he was pretty nervous and didn't know what to expect. We were both also starving. He absolutely LOVED everything he ate. He also ate kim chee for the first time and really like it. I was super impressed! He also ate all the spicy cucumber.   We basically ate everything that was on our plates. It was so ono I could barely handle it. My boyfriend loves me for taking him here and he definitely wants to go again. This restaurant made our night. I'm really happy with my experience here. I LOVE meat jun and I just kept smiling with every bite I took. Usually when I eat out with my boyfriend, I let him finish whatever I can't finish on my plate. But this time, I HAD to finish ALL of my meat jun. It was THAT good. I'm serious, you guys. He went in to finish the rest of my food because he's used to doing that for me but I just gave him the death glare!!! He said, \"How bad do you want it?\" He already knew I had to want it really bad for me to not let him finish it.  THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS FOOD IS!!! YOU NEED TO TRY IT!!! NOW!",

The boiled peanuts were delicious and complimentary! I had to refrain myself from eating too much so I still had room for the meat jun.  I got the combo, which had the chicken teriyaki, galbi (short ribs), and meat jun. The chicken and galbi is juicy, tender and flavorful, but the meat jun was the real centerpiece.  Meat jun is a fusion dish originating from Korean immigrants in Hawaii I believe. It's basically a tender piece of marinated beef pan-fried with a beaten egg. The marinade is a little sweet and has some soy sauce flavor. It compliments the tender, juicy beef perfectly. Add an egg and it's a unique and tasty dish! Highly recommended!  The tea they serve is very good too. \"Polygonatum tea\" apparently.  Lastly, the service was amazing. The waiter/owner was very attentive with tea refills. He also told us about his experience in Hawaii, the special tea, and the meat jun.   One of the greatest restaurants in terms of food, service, and even artwork on the walls! Try the meatjun! You won't find it anywhere else!",

The kind lady that runs the place is Korean and tends to make your food more \"Korean\" (if that even makes sense) if she knows that you are Korean.   The food is FREAKING awesome. A bit on the sweet side, but I seriously can't complain. Had the mul-bi naeng myun (buckwheat noodles 2-ways: one spicy, one with cold broth), the summer noodles, the spam fried rice. I can honestly say that you probably can't go wrong with any order.  This place is a must-try if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Got off work and really craving for a korean/hawaiian bbq. Came across this on yelp so i went to have an early dinner since its the nearest kbbq from work. Went in, it was quite busy. an old lady greeted me while she was cleaning tables. But she didnt really say if I should just get a table myself or wait for someone to have me seated. After about 2mins of standing there, i finally came up to her while she was still cleaning a table and ask, she was like \"for here to go?\" I said for here and she said, oh ok please have a seat (while pointing on a table for 4 on the corner). Sat down and a young lady came up, gave me the menu, and ask what I wanna drink. Her smile was very welcoming so I forgot about the earlier incident. A minute later an old man came up and brought my water, convincing me to try their iced tea instead. But no thank you, im good with iced water. He was very friendly and the whole time i was there, he kept checking on me, but never refilled my water. As for food, food is ok. A little pricey. I ate by myself but i felt like I paid for two. I had the combo which has kalbi, meat jun, and chicken that comes with white rice and mac.. Banchan doesnt have my fish cakes! Huhu. Banchan only consists of kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. I was so sad. I want my fish cake and tofu! lol. I didnt finish all the meat jun and chicken so i asked for a to go box. The old man came back with a to go box full of rice and he said \"for your dinner\" how nice of him! I wanna give this place 4 stars at least, but the food is too pricey, ive had kbbq on same average of taste and quality or better. Just a couple more bucks, i could have had an all u can eat kbbq.",

I loved the Meat Jun so I wanted to try the fish version this time. Well, it was the same difference!! So Mother Freakin' Good!! Soo \"ONO\" as the islanders would say! Once its dipped in their sauce, its a done deal. I had to ask what was the origin of the \"----- Jun\".... The Owner told me that it was Koreans in Hawaii that started making this back in the day.. Gamsahabnida! (Thank you!) Koreans from Hawaii!   I was also brought the napa cabbage, radish and sprouts (korean sides). On top of that, a small bowl of hot Saimin soup to cleanse the palate. Nice!   Again, A Completely Positive Experience!!",

Didn't exactly find either, but married an L.A. girl, raised a family, had a decent career and am now enjoying life.  We vacation in Hawaii about every other year still, and as I'm an honorary Angeleno, my wife is an honorary Local.  So we like Hawaiian culture and lifestyle.  We visit Las Vegas at least once a year, and thanks to yelp, we found Island Style and made our first visit last week.  The yelpers were right on!  We liked the food and the Aloha Spirit epitomized by Russell and the young waiter who served us.  Besides tasting good, the food is comfort food for us.  We LOVED the boiled peanuts that came before our food.  As we explained to Russell, every time we return to Honolulu we immediately go to Times Market to buy a tray of boiled peanuts to nibble with our beers on the lanai.  Taste just like when I was a kid sitting in Honolulu Stadium watching the Islanders (yes, I'm old).  The good old days!  I won't go into a food review because other yelpers have done that. I'll just say that if you like Hawaiian-Asian food, da kine you would like to eat at home, dis is the place to find dat when you stay Vegas.  Maybe next time I'll get some boiled peanuts To Go and have Happy Hour out by the pool of my mega-hotel on The Strip, LOL.  Hmmmmm....",

    "text": "Korean & Hawaiian deliciousness disguised as a hole in the wall.   Don't be too quick  to fall for all the fancy hip places my fellow fans of flavor. From Asian Pacific Islanders to East Coasters know that the best places to get your taste buds a fix is that the least suspecting places. This hole in the wall offers not just home run flavor Korean but also many Hawaiian favorites from Chicken Katsu to boiled peanuts. Me & my family have always been big Korean fans and finding a good place in Las Vegas has been hard for quite some time, but when we discovered Island Style we find ourselves stepping in their doors anytime we crave Korean food.    The Kalbi is excellent, but my favorite is the Meat Jun! They have plenty of tasty appetizers to pick from, large portions, reasonably prized, and the owners are so friendly! They are always either helping customers or working in the kitchen and their dedication has payed off! Everything I order here is consistently great, and the owners are so friendly they offer great help in making a good choice.    I have some Vegan & Vegetarian friends and as much as I love this place it probably wouldn't be my first choice seeing as how it's a largely meat based menu. Overall I back this place hard with 5 stars & if you're local and haven't tried you are missing the boat! Wether it's just you & a friend, or you & a family it's very accommodating and much more spacious than it looks. All this talk is making me crave some Boiled Peanuts & Chicken Katsu, I must fix this ASAP. Hope you enjoy your visit to Island Style!",

A note to foodie snobs... this place may look more like a hole in the wall rather than a gourmet restaurant, but don't dis the place because of its appearance - you're missing out on some awesome food!  Took my brother along for lunch after we ran a couple of errands. After an appetizer of fried mandoo and the usual banchan I had the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi and BBQ chicken) and he went with the roast beef and gravy plate lunch. Neither one of us left anything on the plate when we finished. Yes, its that good!  Russell, the owner is a very friendly person choke full of the 'aloha spirit' and it rubs off on the wait staff as well. We didn't have to wait very long for our meals - I'd say it was already piping hot and on our table in less than ten minutes.  Definitely a must eat place in Sin City - and you got a customer for life! (Whenever I get some time off on parole from 'the rock'.)",

The loco moco was just like the ones I had in Hawaii, though. The kimchi was great, especially the one that has been fermenting for a while, although it has a huge bite, so watch out when you are eating it. The regular kimchi was very good as were the pickled radishes. The staff makes you feel like you are in the islands with their laid back attitude and attentive service.

    "text": "After a long drive to Vegas from the Bay Area, we were looking for a bite to eat before checking into our hotel. Instead of the usual expensive resort fare, we decided to duck into Island Style instead and have a light snack. Right.   Island Style is a very unassuming place in the middle of a nondescript strip mall on the west side. As plain looking as the place is, it is really about the food. I had hot rock Bil Bum Bop and the Missus had a combo that included the best tasting Kalbi ever. The homemade Kim Chee (cabbage, Radish, and cucumber versions) was terrific. Everything on the menu is hand made. As we were walking out, they were making fat hand stuffed won tons.  The only down side was that we ended up eating everything to the point that we may have to beg off on our dinner reservation at the big time strip restaurant.  I have to go back for some Moko Loko for breakfast before I leave town.",

Yes, we've been to the real ones in Hawaii with college roommates from there.   The owner greeted us and served us as if we were dear and regular patrons. The dude is just really cool, and he totally put us in the Island spirit.   The food was just awesome! Since Hawaiian influence on the Korean food tends to make it sweeter, I suggest that you order a combination of spicy and regular dishes. Ask the owner for suggestions. I loved the combo plate. And, the price is the best deal in Vegas.   This is now my favorite restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "Island Style, where Korean food meets Hawaiian hospitality. For being such a hole-in-the-wall, there's a very warm & welcoming ambiance to the place.   BOILED PEANUTS: Get in on it. Enough said.   FOOD: The menu offers a big variety of classic Korean dishes such as Soon Dubu, Naengmyeon, GalbiTang, and Kalbi. All of which I have tried and are delicious! Then there are the Hawaiian staples: Spam Eggs & Rice, Loco Moco, & Rice Omelette. The menu is pretty big here and you can't go wrong no matter what you get. It all has that home-made Korean food flavor. The Meat Jun is spot on here and I never leave without a belly full of their Jjin Mandu (Steamed Korean Dumplings). You could opt for the fried ones but steaming gives them a more delicate flavor as well as cuts the grease. Those along with the Kim-Chi are made in-house. Portions and Value are definitely better here than at some Korean restaurants.  BAN-CHAN: There's always a bunch of little dishes which is the usual for Korean eating. Kimchi, Radish Kimchi, spinach, potato salad, etc. It seems to vary every single time I come here. But its all good. They don't have a problem refilling them either!  TEA: The type of tea they serve is some random type of Korean root tea. Its delicious. Its not the usual Barley Tea (BoRee Cha). It comes from seeping whole pieces of the root and not some store-bought tea bag.   What you lose in 'Location & Decor' you gain in 'Food & Flavor.'  You can also sample Island Style in the Greenland food court.",

    "text": "this is why I love Yelp so much. I would have never found this place had it not been for Yelp. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's in a schlocky strip mall which had me slightly skeptical upon arrival. Walking in the place was pretty warm and there were flies flying around. The owner said he would be right over and the natives stared @ us. As we waited a few minutes I started to worry that this was going to be a miss. (I understand Nathan Y's review) However, once the food started flying and the owner began razz-ma-tazzing with my party, we had a great time and meal.  ~ Loved the boiled peanuts ~ Loved the veggie apps: bean sprouts, Napa cabbage and turnups, he brought us a second batch. ~ My teenage nephews (human garbage cans, or robotic eating machines, take your pick) were tapping uncle with the gut-bombs that were fried rice and 5 egg omelets. ~ My bro had the combo plate with the ribs, chicken & egg mixture. He said he would order it again. ~ I had the Teriyaki Pork. I had to ask what cut it was, I thought belly since it was thin and like bacon. It's pork loin cut really thin and marinated. It was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. It has a sweet taste, it eats like candy. Really, really good & I don't care for sweet dishes by and large.  Great place, that is a hike, but worth the hike. Very cool owner working the front while his wife cooks in back. 5 stars for the food. The place itself would be a hole without the food and owners jivin' & cookin'.",

Friendly, open seating in a clean restaurant.  Very kind, friendly service and fellow diners looking relaxed, happy, and enjoying their lovely food.  As soon as I sat down I noticed the man at the next table devouring the Loco Moco which looked so good.  He overheard me comment about it to my friend and told us it was excellent. He then confirmed that anything ordered here is delicious.  My friend, an island girl, had such a hard time choosing a dish...mainly because everything looked so good.  She decided on the Portuguese sausage, rice and egg...requested egg whites only-- no problem.  I didn't even have to look at the menu. The first dish I always select is Bulgogi.  The food came to the table pretty quickly and, wow.  So good!  Perfect flavors, cooked just right.  Ban chan was mmmmmm yummy.  So much food!  The Portuguese sausage was very nice:  full flavor, not greasy, dense, delicious.  My bulgogi was so scrumptious. It was tender, mixed with a delicious blend of onions, carrots, and sesame sprinkled on top.  The kimchee was so good that when we had eaten all of our first small plate we were tempted to pour the juice on our rice and keep on munching.  I made that comment before our second small dish of kimchee came out and my friend told me she had been thinking the same thing.  We are planning on becoming regulars there and bringing our friends.  What impressed me the most was that as dishes were brought out to other tables, they all looked and smelled divine.  I do not think you can go wrong ordering anything.   The atmosphere was laid back, industrious but not harried, and, yes, loving.  It says a lot that in this kind of town the owners have created a spot where people leave, full, happy, relaxed, and eager to return.  While there, locals, families, foodies, and friends came to eat or pick up orders to go.  This place is well hidden but well-known and my favorite new spot.  And I don't know who he is but there is a very handsome young man working there, too...",

When we pulled up into the sketchy parking lot of Island Style, my husband had some hesitation and suggested we go somewhere else.  But, I told him that people I trusted on Yelp recommended it- so let's just take a look.  Well, when we opened the door- we were welcomed by the owner, Russell like we were \"ohana\"- and the place was pretty packed with Korean, Filipino, and Hawaiian diners.   I am so glad we stepped inside because it truly reminded me of my favorite family owned restaurants in Hawaii! I ordered the combo plate and instantly fell in love with the Meat Jun.  It was my first time trying it, and it will definitely not be my last.  My husband ordered the Stone-Pot Bimimbap and said it was the best he has ever had.  We also ordered a couple Spam Musubi because I can't eat hawaiian food without having some good ol' spam, and the seaweed wrapper was perfectly crunchy. Throw in some delicious good sized plates of banchan- and we were a happy bunch.  If I didn't show some restraint, I would have filled up completely on the kimchi (which is homemade by his wife).   Russell's friendly hospitality was awesome. He even offered to change the TV channel to some cartoons for our toddler- but I told him to leave it on Jeopardy because if she is watching TV, she won't eat. We chatted a bit, and he told us that his wife runs the Island Style at Greenland Market.  Well, the next day- we actually made a trip down to Greenland- and my husband ordered a plate of Meat Jun just for himself this time and loved every bite!",

Well for one, I can say is this: For the price, the large quantity, taste and quality and great customer service gives this place a 5 star and no less.  A must try for the newbies out their is the meatjun, fantastic! They recently added a Chinese Menu which, unfortunately, makes it much more difficult to decide what to eat.  If you aren't sure what you're appetite is feeling like, the server an owners spend more than enough time to explain everything on the menu.   Seating is sometimes limited due to locals who eat here on a daily basis but do not fear, expansion is near! The owners informed me that they will be expanding the restaurant this year to maximize seating occupancy! If you do find yourself waiting for a table however, the servers treat you with their famous boiled peanuts as an appetizer for the wait. They are also very attentive to their customers and always work quick to keep their customers satisfied.  Last tip. If you see the owners son (cute boy with the nose piercing) say hello! He is the most friendliest server ever! And tell him Sam Kim sent you HAHA!",

Huge menu - great selection AND -- there's a sweet lady sitting in the far corner of the restaurant making the \"Mandu\" (dumplings) -- we just had to try them. I ordered grilled chicken (came with rice and macaroni salad) and hubby had chicken Katsu (again with rice and macaroni salad). We also had to order 4 of the fried Mandu. You get the traditional Korean appetizers to munch on while waiting, in addition to these tasty soaked peanuts (which I found out is an \"Island thing\").

It's located in an old strip mall and driving by; you'd either accidently drive past it or purposely lock the car doors and keep driving. Once you enter in the restaurant, it's an environment that is warm and completely welcoming.   This place is always jumping full of people. Many of the diners have been visiting for years and the family who runs the restaurant remembers each and every one of them. It's a great atmosphere and I always feel like I'm a guest in their home when I eat there.   The food is definitely Hawaiian and Korean comfort food. There is a wide selection on the menu and there will be something to please every appetite. I love the plate lunches there, especially the Kalua Pork or if I want something heavier, the roast beef and gravy over rice. The combination plate is also good with the short ribs and bulgogi. My boyfriend loves the Loco Moco plate and the Bibimbap. Occasionally you can substitute white rice for brown (if they have any made). Ask for a cup of Soloman Seal tea if you want the perfect drink to go with your meal.   We came here because we were hungry and we will always return because we are treated like ohana.",

The complimentary Ban Chan which came with our combo plate and Bi Bim Bap Hot Stone was tasty and added to the overall foodie experience.  The wife and I were last here 2 years ago (we don't come to Vegas often) and they have since extended out their dining room and given it a more clean, open, and inviting feel.  This is our \"go to\" whenever we come to town.",

They give out free peanuts when you sit down.  Only 2 things I will say about this place is 1) food is pretty salty both with the peanuts, panchan (bean sprouts) and meat.  I tongue was parched and salted like jerky by the end.  2) the prices have gone up!  I was looking at the pictures of the menu on here and the prices have all gone up like $2-$4 each (hence you see a new menu and scratched prices).  Otherwise, the female waitress were a bit sour and unfriendly but the guys were super friendly and awesome.  The one we had was Hawaiian (had the accent and swagger) but looked Korean - there goes that \"Island fusion style. \"",

We love the peanuts that came to our table as we sat down. I ordered the combination plate and loved it. We also got a huge portion of kimchi. Yummy. I cant wait to go back to explore there other dishes.  Then at the end of the meal our waiter brings us 2 coffees to go (which we did not order). He herd us mention we were driving back to LA and wanted us to stay awake.  AWESOME!",

He and I love Korean food and through going to countless places, we have begun to understand the Korean food menu. Good thing, cuz the in-laws were clueless and needed direction.  Long story longer, they seemed to enjoy their food somewhat. They said it wasn't super good, but it was good. Ray L. reviewed the same experience as I did. Service was bad. Our waitress was taking our order and while I was talking to her she walked away and helped another customer. WTF?? I was talking to you ya freak! Next our food came out one at a time. BOO! No offers for refills....Ok that's enough.   The guy there was very nice, almost too nice. He made some boiled peanuts for my in-laws to take to the airport. He talked about them like they were a delicacy. To be honest, my in-laws couldn't even stand the smell they made in the car and we had to pull over and throw them away.  The place definitely has heart, I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they can be more consistent in service and food...",

Since I couldn't see waiter/waitress, I thought I'd wait until someone showed up and guide us.  Then someone from back peeked me behind the curtain and moved on, without saying a single word.  I thought \"OK.  She will probably inform someone.\"  After a short while, guy came out from back and started to pick up dishes and clear the table.  He also peeked us for brief moment, without saying a word again, and went back to what he was doing.  From that point I got pretty pissed that none working in the restaurant really wanted my business.  Those people who peeked could have at least said \"WAIT.\"  I have not heard the single word from them.  I then just left the restaurant and went somewhere else.  It was my first visit, and I am not going there ever again.",

The black noodles always hit the spot and you can tell it's good as many local Koreans flock to this place for that dish. Only a few places in town that can execute that dish like they do.  They have many other items on the menu i have never tried. Looked and smelled like they had good Hawaiian/Korean barbecue plates as well.   When I was there, I believe it was the owner who took care of the front of house flow while his wife was the one whipping up the amazing dishes. I believe the guy is hawaiian and his wife Korean. Amazing service and great food.   Being a Korean restaurant they obviously have some ban chan and also some peanuts to snack on before the meal which was nice.   I like that they do not try to be anything flashy or special. Highly recommend this place.",

I mixed the noodles and veggies sauce but some bites had Mo flavor while others were too salty. Bad mixing on my part?  Service is great.

Bland, basic decor, lighting is almost hospital sterile in many ways.  Based on the name, we thought it would be 75% Hawaiian food and 25% Asian Fusion food.  But in reality it was 30% Hawaiian food and 70% Korean food.  We focused on the Hawaiian dishes and we just thought they were OK.  We tried Bi Bim Bopp, Masubi and the Combo Dish (meat & egg platter or sorts).  Based on reviews on YELP on this place, we were expecting something more and some element of WOW.  It did not happen.  It's not that it was bad, but We've experienced better.  Food was just OK.  Staff was nice, but not particularly attentive of friendly.

    "text": "Bailey Z. said it best when he described Island Style as \"a Korean establishment masquerading as a Hawaiian restaurant masquerading as a Korean restaurant.\"  On our last visit to Vegas, we were searching for a good ol Hawaiian joint, and Yelp led us here.  It's in a small, run down strip mall.  Completely unassuming, and a little sketchy looking at first glance.  Don't let that scare you.  It's well worth a visit.  Inside, I was quite surprised that this place was more a Korean restaurant than a Hawaiian joint.  We went with it, and ordered mostly Korean.  They started us out with a good assortment of banchan.  I had the spicy pork and it was delicious.  Spicy, sweet, served on a sizzling hot plate with a boatload of onions.  I had it with a side of mac salad, which was ok.  I've only had one mac salad that absolutely blew me away, so this was along the lines of most others.    The kiddo had the kalbi ribs, and from the look of the plate of bones, I think he was pleased.    The hubby got the jajangmyeon, and said it was delicious as well.  I had never tried this particular dish before our visit here, and it was a little intimidating at first.  Since then, we've had it a few other times, and this place is one of the best.  The sauce is so flavorful, and the noodles were just right.    A few other dishes on the table were the spam musubi (did not disappoint), and hot stone bibimbap (another solid dish).  So, if you want Hawaiian, they've got a few basics (spam musubi, kalbi, teriyaki, katsu) but the shining stars here are the Korean dishes.  Apparently the meat jun is one of the best around, so I'd go that route if you're not sure what to get.",

We walked in and the place was busy seemed like the end of lunch rush. The tables are stacked next to each other in the middle like family style or large groups. So you would end up sitting next to strangers. That I didn't like at all. It was bad enough that as soon as we walked in all eyes were on us. I hate that. But we found a table by the wall where we could sit alone. The tables that were empty were dirty. Our server Jody (male) he was nice and cleaned off our table while we sat down.   Jody was what made me give 4 stars instead of 3. He was so nice and so personable, not to mention very attentive. Good service makes all the difference to me.   Looking at the menu I was quite overwhelmed. It's huge! Perhaps because it's in both English and Korean. But I didn't know what to order so my friend said she always gets the combo plate. We both ordered the combos. Then some lady comes by puts little kimchi dishes on our table and boiled peanuts. The boiled peanuts are interesting but pretty good. I now know I am not a fan of kimchi. I didn't like it. I tried a few. The bean sprout one and the radish one and some sort of white noodle thing.   The combo comes with teriyaki BBQ chicken, beef rib tips, some meat egg combination I think it was called Jin, lots of rice, macaroni salad and a dipping sauce. It was good. I'd order it again.",

It will always be my favorite here at this restaurant. They also have other Island foods like Loco Moco, Kalbi, Chicken Katsu, Spam Musubis, etc. The restaurant is like a little hole in the wall type so it's a little easy to miss.",

Even though the portions were huge, we all cleaned our plates.  Right after you sit down they bring you about 5 or 6 kinds of appetizers (free) that vary daily.  We had everything from seaweed to kimchee to hotdogs and onions to these awesome pickles.  And more.  Yum!  The restaurant is in a strip mall and isn't impressive looking, inside or out. Don't be fooled! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be eating my way though the menu...  Best service ive had in awhile. Value too. For four people all in (& over tipping) we paid $62.",

He was really sweet and came over with sirracha sauce later for me. I was albe to eat in literally, 30 min, but this was also at 3pm on a weekday! i'm from NC and was just visiting and i'm so glad i came here instead of eating something quick at a wendy's!

    "text": "I definitely need to update my rating and review because I've had much better experiences during my last two visits.  The Jajangmyeon (Chinese-style wheat noodles in stir-fried black bean sauce) is still a must and one of my favorite Korean dishes! Last night, the noodles were slightly overcooked and seemed different from the first two times I've had it, but the sauce was on point. It's also just $8.95.  After feeling like the Hawaiian eats were a bust, I ordered the Kalua Pork and Cabbage ($12.95) the last two times and it is delicious! It's one of my favorite Hawaiian dishes, so it has my stamp of approval. The sticky white rice and macaroni salad were good too.  Not surprisingly, the Banchan didn't impress me. I didn't like their kimchi at all and there wasn't anything else memorable. However, we love the complimentary boiled peanuts (another Hawaii \"pupu\" staple)!  Service is wonderful and everything is so quick, which is very good because it gets busy! We were there for dinner on Saturday night around 7:30pm and although there was no wait, the tables were full.  I wish this spot wasn't so far from home, but there aren't many places that serve Jajangmyeon, so I'll definitely be back for those noodles and some Kalua Pork and Cabbage!",

We ordered spicy chicken and good Lord it was good. It wasn't spicy at all. If you are still afraid it's going to be spicy you can order it to be toned down. It came in the sizzling dish with side of rice. And it was enough for me and my mom. They kept serving the side dishes and that was really really good too. I highly recommend this place!

I've never been to a restaurant that has a combination of Hawaiian and korean food. I stuck with the korean side since I was craving soondubu, but I will definitely be back to check out the Hawaiian food.  I ordered the seafood soondobu, and it came with the fried fish on the side, my favorite!!!!   The soup itself was pretty yummy, but didn't come with as much seafood as other places.   My friend's japchae order was huge, and easily could have fed 3 people.   Price points are great, and portion sizes are huge, the food is delicuous, I will definitely be coming back here again.",

    "text": "I'm surprised that I haven't posted a review on Island Style as I have been coming here since I moved to Las Vegas a few years ago.   While working in the CA office right before moving to Vegas, I remember over hearing the IT guys looking forward to going to the Vegas office and having a meal at the Hawaiian restaurant near it. I was thinking to myself, what you know about Hawaiian food?  So then I looked it up and I was like, Yes! Korean Hawaiian food and meat jun is on the menu so I had to check this place out and the rest is history.   You ask how authentic is the Korean food? Well in one visit, the table next to us, two Korean customers, ordered a soup where the tentacles were still moving. This restaurant is a hot spot for Koreans and their families. I would say the clientele is half Korean and half Hawaii patriots.   Part of the reason why this place is awesome is because of the owner. I learned a while ago that she immigrated from Korea to HI several years ago where she learned to cook the HI favorites and then later moved to Las Vegas and opened up this restaurant. I was told that when Greenland Supermarket opened up, they approached her to open up an express in there food court. On this last visit, she helped bus our table and packed our leftovers. When she did, she added more rice and bonchon. She is an absolute sweetheart.   I hardly ever order anything else. My go to meal here is Meat Jun, thinly cut marinated beef fried in egg. It is as good as HI.   One of the things that first surprised me is that they serve boiled peanuts instead of dinner rolls. So good especially when I haven't had it in several years since moving away from HI 13 years prior. I remembered one day I ordered takeout and asked for the boiled peanuts. They gave me two of the small takeout boxes. While in the lunchroom, one of the women asked if she could taste it and she ended up eating most of the peanuts!   This is one of the must restaurants I bring HI transplants to if they want a taste of HI.   There is no ambience in this restaurant. You're really here for the food.   It's simple for me; 5-Stars all the way around for Island Style.",

I ordered the meat jun and it was BOMB!   - the beef was flavorful, tender, and moist.  - the egg wasn't over cooked  - most of all the dipping sauce was out of this world.  - Rice and Mac salad on point as well.  I definitely would give this place 5 stars BUT there were some negatives.  - OVERPRICED! if I were to have this plate in Hawaii the portion would be quadrupled the size for the same price / this plate was $14 and is suitable for one person to eat not two  - not enough portion  - drinks aren't refillable   Overall i enjoyed it but wished it could be a little bit more affordable for just a plate lunch place but it's a good place to go if you're a little hungry and want authentic Korean food",

The wonton min which my hubby and his mom ordered were just ok. It didn't have that authentic saimim taste like you get in Hawaii. We did enjoy the banchan as well as the peanuts. Also, customer service was awesome, thus the 4 stars. Everyone was so friendly and made us feel at home. The restaurant is located in a plaza which has plenty of parking. It's on Sahara near Decatur. Easy to find on Google maps. Check their hours before coming. We liked how they had lots of options from Korean food to Hawaiian food but not if you are looking for authentic Hawaiian food. Overall, good experience, great customer service and easy to find location.",

Decoration and the interior wasn't outstanding. Kind of look sketchy but isn't! Menu was simple and straight forward. We got the bulgolgi, soft tofu seafood soup, and bi bim bap on a hot stone pot! Bulgolgi came with rice already and the soup was perfect since it's so cold in Vegas! Service was slow but it's understandable since there were two big groups here and there was only 2 workers. Food came out to be $40 including tips. Would definitely return when I'm back in Vegas! :)",

It wasn't super flavorful but I wanted breakfast for dinner.   The bibimbap was delicious. It was a good portion for one person, and the chili paste on the side was delicious! If added good flavor to the dish.   Overall, I did enjoy the flavor of the bibimbap! It was nice to try while I was in Vegas.",

When you come in you get a basket of boiled, salted peanuts. Not really my cup of tea, but it's always nice when they bring out something to nibble on while you wait for the main dish. Gotta appreciate that.   The meat was grilled with onions, green onions, and mushrooms. It was delicious, chewy, and flavorful.  The kimchee (cabbage, radish) were surprisingly fermented and spcied just right. Rice cooked like any Korean mother would..  I could do without the macaroni too much mayo..   The second trip had the dol sot bi bim bap and it was not bad. It had all the usual suspects: radish, spinach, beef, egg... Again, for the price it's a great spot for the tired and hungry.  I'll be back...Did I mention prices were a darn good deal?  About ten bucks per most, with some sandwiches and burgers for less than 5.",

    "text": "Great service, the kind waiter was awesome, wish I got his name. Along with the awesome hospitality, everything we ordered was really really good. What we had was the teriyaki salmon and the fried rice, the son had the spam masubi. What we also tried was the this fried wonton gyoza type thing, I'm not sure what the name of it was, because he brought it out to us \"on the house\". They brought in some side dishes before our meal that was kimchi, sprouts, hotdogs, and some radish type thingy. I really want to describe all my food (but I will only reviews my teriyaki salmon) and everything I sampled from others that were with us, but the thing is, I'm not sure what their meal was, but what I can tell you is that everything I did try was really really good, with no complaints whatsover.   Ok for our teriyaki salmon, it was probably the best salmon I've ever tasted at a restaurant, they made my food perfect. Don't you hate it when your fish turns out dry because it has been over cooked? well this salmon was a bit rawish in the middle, I guess you can say it was cooked \"rare\" I guess you can say in steak terms. I love raw fish (sushi type) and this meal reminded me just that, cooked on the outside, but slightly in the inside. Just typing about my meal is making me hungry again. It was nice and juice cooked to perfection with some yummy dipping sauce and mac salad and rice on the side. YUUUMMMMMMM  I will cut this review short because I will come back and re review this place. I really wanted to try the oxtail soup on the menu, but already thought we ordered way too much food. I'll be back for more soon.  Usually a good service place + really really good food = 5 stars, but I yet I only gave e'm 4. I will promise an update after I try their oxtail soup and if knocks me out of the park, I will definitely give this place a home run (5 stars). You can check out what we had at <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdkcFRZ8rE1c%26feature%3Dplcp&s=5f001c1f3a80ac975f8620499608672378a998fda1db3761db533f57979b191b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=dkcF...</a> (this video is about our days, so skip to 1:50 to see the food).

If you want yummy Asian & Hawaiian food at a budget-friendly price, then give Island Style a chance.  They are located on Sahara Ave. in a strip mall that looks like it has seen better days.  Would never have stopped here, if not for Yelp.  Our group of 20 people came here for dinner.  Called about 30 minutes in advance.  Walked into a clean establishment and were greeted nicely.  They had our tables set up and ready to go.  Service was excellent throughout the evening.  Chicken Katsu was my choice.  Hard to mess up that order.  Tasted just as good as other places that I've had it.  (3.5 stars)  Spicy Seafood Soup was flavorful and filled with good stuff!  Everything went well together in this concoction!  (4 stars)  Bibimbap Hot Plate was my wife's order.  She said that it was the best bibimbap that she has ever had!  Highly recommended!!  (5 stars)  Our whole party left here happy!!  Great service + affordable prices + clean restaurant + good tasting food = Recipe for success!!!  Keep up the great job Island Style!  We will return!",

    "text": "My husband and I came by here two Thursdays ago for lunch. I had this place bookmarked for a little over year and have always wanted to come and glad that I finally did.  Anyways, when we arrived, I didn't really know what to expect. From the outside, this place looked a little sketchy. The sign has graffiti on it and the little strip mall this is located in just seemed kind of small and not in the best of neighborhoods. Anyways, when we walked in, we were acknowledged by a server and she told us to pick a table to sit down. When we sat down, we were given 2 cups of water and a closed styrofoam container. Wasn't too sure what that styrofoam container was for and thought our server accidentally put it on our table and that she boxed up someone's leftovers at another table.  Inside the styrofoam container is cold boiled peanuts so we started eating that as we were deciding what to order. Our server came by pretty quickly and we ended up ordering:  2 orders of Bibimbap in a stone pot- delicious! Just as good as any other place I have had bibimbap. Loved the crunchy rice as well (the benefits of ordering this in a stone pot/ bowl).   Chicken Musubi- Delicious! I didn't know musubi could be made with chicken since I have always seen it only with spam. The only thing is that the chicken was a bit oily, but that's expected at a down home place like this.  Spam Musubi- I didn't get a bite of this but my husband liked it. The size for this musubi and the chicken one was a pretty big piece.   Our meal was also rounded out with some banchan. We got 4 little plates and my favorite was this one with broccoli. One man, whom I suspect is one of the owners (or maybe the manager) refilled our banchan throughout our meal. Our server was great at refilling our water. This other guy (I guess you can call him a server to?) also refilled our water and was really friendly. Service was very attentive, quick and very friendly. I will definitely come back here again the next time I am in the area. Oh and real random, this place has fast (ask for the password) wifi.",

    "text": "Why oh Why has it taken me so long too check out Island Style. Talk about some awesome local grinds. Think not even taped the surface of this menu! Geesh! I think this place taken over my top spot for local style plate lunch food. Plus if local food not your thing they have another whole section of the menu of Chinese. No doubt is coming too Island Style need too go local style!!!!!  I keep hearing about the Meat Jun and its something always always been fan of when it comes too korean food. Toss up between Meat Jun and Kali bi. Only winnahs either or both. The Meat Jun was Amazing!! I love the fact that the egg batter outside not too thick but just right amount of coating not see the meat until dig in, outside nice golden brown, the meat inside has nice seasonings, and meat was moist. Tradition local style white rice and mac salad. I liked the mac salad. The portion size is great! All of it under ten dollars. Is there better deal for lunch?? Think not! Hawaiian food always get your money worth and more....  One of the highlights was the sides that your meal came with at Island Style. Moist Korean restaurants been too can be hit or miss the amount they give plus the different types you get. Here you get five different ones. Although it was only me they were very generous with everything. Korean kim chee fan for life. The kim chee here not hot hot but still good. The roasted peanut action. Now if that doesn't speak too keeping it local style not sure what else can say.  It comes with anything you order almost like bread no charge. They even put it in a to go container so can take it home. Sweet!   The service was great! U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds. They just expanded couple weeks ago so restaurant is lot bigger. I went for lunch so the place was not too packed. Parking can be issue if go when busy since only parking in front of the restaurant. If looking for Meat Jiun Island Style the only way too go. No doubt plan on going back because Kali bi, Katsu, combo plates, fried noodles, and so much more too try.",

In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area.",

Dont be fooled however, there is nothing trendy or hip about this place which is why I love it. Good service and great food at fair prices. They usually make almost anything I ask for even its not on the menu and most of the time Jody remebers what I like and I dont have to ask.   The fried rice here is crackin which is saying a lot because, well.. how good can fried rice be right? Trust me it is good here.  My wife faithfully gets kalbi and haemul tofu jigae and it is always consistent. We always leave with leftovers.",

    "text": "I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It really reminded me of the feel of being at a restaurant in S. Korea. My party sat down and we were immediately given \"water\" (It's this tea that is given all the time in Korea instead of water.. Bori cha? or something like that). The older people got hot drinks, and the younger people got the iced version. Not sure if that's a cultural thing...   We ordered mandu (dumpling) soup, half champeong (spicy seafood noodle) and half jajungmeun (bean paste noodles), and pork + cabbage with rice. We got a few good standard side dishes, too. The main dishes were very flavorful (maybe too salty). The shredded pork was a bit dry, but I enjoyed it anyway. I thought it was awesome how you can do half of the champeong and half jajungmyun. Brilliant.  They gave you boiled peanuts in a styrofoam box if you ask for it. I think some tables just got it without asking... It's free... I'm not quite sure how the system works. The workers there speak Korean and the younger workers are bilingual.   Service and food coming out was fast. For what this place is, it's excellent. Nothing fancy. Somewhat hole in the wall. Just straight up authentic.",

Facility:  This is small restaurant located in the middle of a strip mall. It's kinda a little divey, but the food is amazing, so who cares. They hVe table and chair seating.   Service:  the wait staff are professional and extremely attentive. Sometimes they get busy, but they scan the room looking for anyone who need help, so just signal them over.   Food: Thai is why I love this place. They have Korean and Chinese food, and even some Hawaiian influences. Such authentic flavors.  My favorite thing to order is their combo plate. It has 3 different kinds of meat, Korean ribs, a teriyaki chicken and a beef in fried egg. All three are delicious!!! They serve it with white rice and macaroni salad.  They also serve some very good banchan with it! I love their cucumber kimchi and seaweed noodles. I just really love this place.   Overall:  they have great service and good authentic food. I will definitely be back many times!  I live close by too!  Lucky me. :P",

First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it.   So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.  I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic).   I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat.   So overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.",

We got kalbi, bulgogi and mandu - all of which were good.  I can't say they have the best Korean dishes I've had but I guess for the price, it was reasonable.  I didn't get to try their Hawaiian offerings - I was full.  Service was great.  The server was still nice even though it was crazy busy.  It was a bit loud and people were just chilling with their family.  Laidback atmosphere and not pretentious at all.  Truly Island Style!",

The first time I was here years ago not long after their opening, Russell offered us soup without charge, and was so friendly and welcoming. I've come here for lunches, dinners, and pick-ups. I've had their Korean, Chinese and Hawaiian dishes and none has disappointed. One of my favorites is definitely the jajangmyun (wheat noodles in black bean sauce). The portion is huge and I usually eat about half and take the rest to go. I especially like to order pick-up from here because the food has always been quick and ready for me when I arrive. The service could be a bit slow and at times it's hard to get the servers' attention, but the place is usually pretty busy. This is definitely one of my go-to places for Korean/Hawaiian food, and one of the best in town.",

Took advice on the local favorites which was pretty much the same for all the other Island joints. Their Meat Jun(10) on the other hand was what caught my tongue. Teriyaki BBQ Chicken(7) and Saimin were alright(7). House Fried Rice(8) was great unlike many other places that dont have much flavor. And i must add that the Macaroni Salad(3) that came with my entree was really salty. Hopefully just a bad batch.  From all the other reviews, it looks like ima have to come back for the Kalbi.",

By chance my aunt brought us here again and I t is even better.  The mix of Hi style and Korean food is way better than you'd get anywhere else.  We had Kalbi, meat/fish jun, Japanese curry, gan ja jang, Jam pong, sweet sour pork, cold noodles, spam musubi, fries, Mac salad and more from couple of visits this trip. We were surprised we finished it all. Soo good!!! If you like the little mom and pop, hole in the wall, big personalities restaurant that put out really delicious food. This is it!",

    "text": "Was on vacation in Vegas when we decided to try this place because of the good yelp reviews. Being from Hawaii we had pretty high expectations of a place called \"island style restaurant\" lol. In reading and looking at the pics on yelp it seemed to be Korean & Hawaiian \"local\" type of food. I'm very particular about my Korean food (growing up on mom's home cooking: mom is pure Korean)  First off when you walk in it's a typical restaurant, nothing fancy, seats maybe 50 or more people (going off of memory) you're greeted right away by this guy who I believe to be the owner, really personable & friendly. We look over the menu and I feel like I'm back home in Hawaii. Typical \"local\" dishes: hamburger steak, Saimin, etc. and Korean items such as: mandoo, kalbi, etc. So much to choose from we decide to get:  Me-black bean noodles/jajang mein.  Hubby-some kind of dinner special-kalbi, meat jun, etc.  Son1-saimin  Son2-spicy seafood soup  As we're waiting we get banchan- an assortment of peanuts, daikon, kimchi, etc. which was nice & plentiful. As the food starts coming out we're just amazed at the portion size of each dish, thinking \"oh oh, we might've ordered too much\" lol meanwhile conversing with the owner we find out they have been there over 20 yrs. Such a friendly & generous host! We were so hungry we forgot to take before pics of the food but I did get the after dishes.  All in all the food was great, staff/owner were awesome, would def recommend & come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

Not only is the food delicious and served quickly, the restaurant itself is filled with a familial warmth and welcoming atmosphere.    The owner's truly make you feel at home, offering delicious suggestions of what to sample that night alongside sharing their favorite ways to enjoy the meal.  Tonight my husband and I tried the Black bean noodles & sweet sour pork combo alongside the beef bulgogi and spam fried rice.    Everything was delicious, choice side dishes (they serve an addictive clear seaweed salad that I loved)  and super refreshing iced barley tea...  Our favorite dish of the night was the Sweet and Sour Pork.  A must have!  We will be back again to try more of the menu.  Next time we'll be sure to bring friends as they have very generous portions!  Thank you for the delightful meal and allowing us into enjoy your company, we will be back soon.",

There are no flashy sign, artsy decor, or anything that will grab your attention. One of our friend who is a regular and knows the owner invited us to check out this place.   This is definitely a hole in a wall establishment that built its reputation from making delicious food. You can tell the owner enjoyed what they do. They are constantly talking to the customers, taking orders, making recommendations, and checking on us periodically to make sure everything is okay. You don't get that at most places anymore.   We like to order a bit of everything and eat it family style. This let us try multiple dishes at once. To keep it from getting too long, everything we ordered was of top quality. Everything was delicious and flavorful. Some highlights are the mandu (Korean style dumpling), bi bim bop (hot stone), japchae, ja jang myeun with sweet and sour pork. They also have side dishes as well.   This is one place I will come back to try other dishes on their menu. We left feeling full and satisfied. The owners are super friendly and easy to talk to. They made our first time experience one we will not forget and possibly have future cravings for!",

The food is delicious, the staff are friendly and hospitable. The barley tea hot or cold is refreshing. I love this place! You can't go wrong with the mandoo here. Their side dishes are very good as well. I like to ask for the whole fresh kimichi when they have it, it will change your life. The soondubu(tofu soup) is perfect here, as is their dolsot bibimbap(stone bowl) the trick with this one is to not stir the bottom until you are done so you get maximum crispy rice.   My favorite here is still the half and half with jjampong(spicy seafood noodle soup) and jajangmen(black bean noodle), or jajangbap(black bean sauce on rice). These are both the best that I've ever had and it is impossible to order just one. The good thing is. Island style doesn't make me choose, they have a split bowl so I can have a half order of each!  Anyways. This place is the best if you are looking for Korean food. I know there are a ton of Korean BBQ joints around, that's not what this place is. Island style is home style Korean food with some hawaiian flare done right. And the staff will treat you like family.",

They put the sauce on the side so u can pour it yourself or dip :)  Their side dishes are also tasty. My favorite was this radish leaves kimchi (I think that's what I was told) but she brought it out a little later so not sure if it's part of the regular side dishes or if you have to ask for it.  They have both Korean and Hawaiian food on separate menus.   Service : they are so nice. All of the owners. They came out to fill our tea multiple times. They greeted us as soon as we walked through the door! And noticed one of my friends wearing a lighter color shirt and came over and offered one of those plastic bibs so he wouldn't get his shirt dirty.

I am so glad I decided to finally drop in today. I ordered the Kalbi & fried rice. OMG their fried rice portion is HUGE. Definitely enough to share! In my opinion, their Kalbi is the best that I've tasted compared to all the Hawaiian restaurants in town. Even better than Island Flavor's version. Customer service here is great. They are very friendly and so quick to serve you. The waitress gave us little plates of various items before our meals came out. The boiled peanuts were my favorite. It reminded me of the way my mom cooked hers when I was a little girl. The kind man recommended us the barley tea. I'm glad we got it. It was perfect even without sugar. I love this restaurant. I just hate the location. I only wish I had came and tried this place when I first saw it. The food here is legit and worth the long drive!",

I've eaten a lot of things on the menu but my favorite dishes are bi bim look soo, bi bim bop (hot stone pot is the best) and fried mandoo. It never fails that I always end up eating these items every time I go in. I even do a lot of take out from here. They're super fast and friendly. Service is never an issue for me here nor is the food. The place is a little older but I don't mind it. Makes me feel like I'm eating at a mom and pop shop or a bbq place back home in Hawaii. They usually give really good size portions too. I usually have food left over to take home as well. And they also give a lot of banchan even to go . Definitely would recommend anyone to try this place. Good food and good service is what will always bring me back.",

    "text": "Wow. In terms of food, this is at least 4.5 stars. Shoot, maybe 4.7. But the location, decor, setting, and venue are just so \"downtown\" that it is distracting, and has to demerit a star. I'll be honest with you, Yelp Fam, I hesitated before going inside this restaurant.  I mean, I looked at the door, the sign, the parking lot, and then was going to turn back into my car.  But then I thought, \"Hey, I'm a maverick! Plus, people on Yelp gave it high marks! Give it a try!\"  So I did.  And it was worth it.  The food almost makes up for the lack of ambience, decor, or any style of any sort.  The set up is like a dank cafeteria in a work camp in 1950s Poland, or Korea, perhaps.  The restaurant is clean, don't get me wrong.  Just not sparkly or bright.  The art on the wall, such as it is, is an afterthought, and there is a lone TV playing some completely nondescript channel.  Tables are pushed together \"family style,\" but it does not feel like your family.  But the food is top notch.  And the hospitality and service are even better.  The little fried fish, something like a large sardine, was as perfect a bite as I have had in a long while.  Smoky, with just the right amount of salt and texture.  The little antipasti, seaweed, kimchi, and even little cut up hot dogs, were delightful, with interesting clashing of flavor, and just the right amount of heat.  The pork belly soup was strong, generously filled with vegetables and tofu. (I could have used a little more pork belly, but that is being picky).  The beef rib bim bip bop (spelling?) was rich and succulent, with pickled carrots and seaweed that should not have worked together, but did.    Everything came out hot, quick, and with a sincere smile.  Things were cleared away at the right time, and you were checked on just when you needed to be without hovering.  Really expert.  The server was extremely adept at making you feel welcome and helping you to understand and order what you wanted off the vast menu.  She was a doll, and a consummate professional who could likely fit in at any Michelin star restaurant (and I've been to a couple!)    I have since learned that the style of dining is depicted on various Korean soap opera dramas, so not that unusual.  It is encouraging that people do come with their families here, and you can hear some diners speaking in Korean.  (Although the restaurant presents a pan-Asian menu, with Hawaiian specialties).  I think the restaurant would only need a little makeover help to make this place a more attractive eatery (after all, we do \"eat\" with our \"eyes,\" as well).  If you don't mind the atmosphere, you will enjoy a great meal and hospitality here.",

I felt like I was eating at my parents house. You're greeted and treated so warmly here.  The food here is delicious. It's Hawaiian and Korean. You have your Hawaiian dishes (spam musubi, moco loco, etc) and then you have your Korean dishes. You get good banchan while you wait (boiled peanuts, kimchi, radish etc). I got the bibimbap on a hot stone and it was so delicious. The size of the dish is pretty big and the price is just right. If you're not too hungry you might want to consider sharing with a friend.   Overall the strip mall and the parking lot are a bit sketchy and odd, and the layout of the restaurant is very basic. But, don't think twice about the looks cuz this place is amazing.",

I mean, honestly, I've only tried a handful of Korean dishes, and probably couldn't tell you much about them other than a brief description. But I stick to what I love and know best: meat and noodles.  My brother and I met Katrina M. here for a lunch date - welcomed warmly on such a dreary day. We ordered the Meat Combo plate ($9.90) that came with Meat Jun, BBQ Chicken, Kalbi, macaroni salad and rice. Then, of course, we ordered my spicy cold noodles ($9.90) and a sauntering pot of seafood soup for Katrina M.   I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all the meat options - the Meat Jun unexpectedly becoming my favorite. Egg battered beef, it was tender and bursting with flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and kalbi is always good. But my cold buckwheat noodles - they were perfection. The balance of spice and acidity warming me up perfectly on a \"Seattle\" day.  What really made this trip to Island Style was the hospitality. Warmly greeted by both the proprietor and his never-ending supply of hot barley tea, I felt like I could sit there forever, taking shelter from the sporadic weather, eating my spicy noodles in bliss.",

Russell and his wife are always so welcoming, and the food is always fast, hot, delicious and plentiful.  They never let our glasses get half empty or our stomachs to go without some gratifying morsel.  They are always going above and beyond, like bringing us extra mandu or topping off my kids' meal with an Otter Pop!  This place is a gem, and it deserves so much to be on map of great restaurants, but yet I want it to remain small and intimate and familial like it is.  My family and I want to yell it from the rooftops--- WE LOVE THIS PLACE!",

Food tasted good but the portion was not worth the price.  $19.99 for kalbi but the Korean kalbi small and skinny, the combo was $15.00 but 1 piece meat each was not worth the pruce, the chicken kat su like 1 piece chicken breastfeeding cut into 6 pieces.  Which was $10.00.  Portion servings is not worth the price you charge.  I really think you guys should reconsider your servings.  I am a chef myself and feel that the prices is not worth it.  If you tried 808 mixed plate kalbi it's the fat kalbi with lots of meet on and grilled beautiful and almost same price very tasty.  Even L & L GIVES HALF A PLATE OF KATSU AND SAME PRICE.   Thank you",

Some of my friends have been here previously and told me how amazing the food was and how nice the owners are.   So a big group of my friends and I went here for lunch. I got:  -combination plate: the beef jun is sooo sooo good.  -fried mondu: very fresh and light tasting  -spam msubui: I love spam and its prepared fresh and made with a little bit of sauce in it  -Kimchee and pickled radish: its so fresh and yummy. I couldn't stop eating it!   Everything on the menu looks so good. It was really hard for my friends and I to make a deciosn of what to get. The owners are so nice here. I will make sure to stop by this place every time I am in Vegas. Food was really good and you can tell all the locals love going to this place. One of my favorite meals in Vegas!",

Almost identical to that of Shiros in Waimalu. The owners are super sweet too. I didn't have the pleasure of meeting the Wife but the husband (Russell) was a great host. He even compt our drinks.

Condition: Don't let the location of a ghetto strip mall & exterior \"hole-in-the-wall\" appearance fool you. The restaurant is very clean and well-kept. Even the chopsticks are nicer than most restaurants in Vegas  Service: A+++ Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by Russell right away. Before i could even put my bag down he came by with free boiled peanuts, water and menu recommendations for us. Guess we looked like newbies :P Russell also made sure our water and tea glasses were never empty and kept refilling our side dishes without even being asked. He is definitely not stingy about his food like most Asian restaurants. We weren't treated as customers, but more like family  Food: A+++          - I got the Seafood Soondubu + Kalbi + Fish = A+++ Tasty tofu soup with clams, mushroom & shrimp. The kalbi and fish were good, but nothing extraordinary.             - My BF and GF got the Combo with Meat Jun, chicken & Kalbi with substituted    fried rice. DELICIOUS! Not to mention, the portions were pretty big, which just means i get to share with them :P  Complimentary Side dishes: A+++ radish, cabbage kimchee, bean sprouts, & Hot dog with onions. My favorite was the cabbage kimchee --i could eat those like chips!!! The hot dog and bean sprouts were also yummy. Russell also brought us some dried seaweed and \"korean style\" kimchee to try out; that one was too sour for me.  I am definitely coming back the next chance i get! I love Russell's enthusiasm and charismatic personality! How he runs his restaurant is refreshing and rare in this town. My BF even said he felt like Russell was like an Uncle to him LOL  TIP: Don't confuse this restaurant with the one on spring mountain, with almost the same name!",

I was so excited when we discovered this hidden gem on urban spoon and yelp, that my husband and I drove down right away!  It did not disappoint either...many of the other reviews talked about it being a hole in the wall or a non attractive restaurant but on the contrary it is much nicer than many of the Korean restaurants in Hawaii. The atmosphere is quaint and slightly reminiscent of many local Hawaii establishments.  The menu had everything I wanted and the service was absolutely terrific!! My husband and I ordered the combo plates and were very pleased by the portions and price.  Overall a top notch place with excellent food, service, and experience. You definitely receive Aloha treatment here and I would recommend it to anyone!",

If you're debating between a couple places, this is the one to choose.   On the recommendation of the owner, we ordered the manju (dumplings) fried, the combo plate with teriyaki chicken, kalbi, and meat jun (marinated meat topped with egg), and the fried saipan. The dumplings were really good...juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside with a delicious sauce to dip in. The combo plate came with macaroni salad and we added the spam fried rice to it (definitely do it). All of the meats on the combo plate were tasty and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try a lot of different items on the menu. The fried saipan was good, but I would probably try something else when I come back since it didn't blow me away. Along with the meal, there's a couple banchan (side dishes), which were pickled daichon, kimchi, and fried hot dog pieces. All of these were well made as well.  In terms of the service, it was as if I was at my aunt or grandma's house... we were hooked up with an extra dumpling on the manju plate to make sure that each person had an equal number of dumplings at our table. When our water ran out, we were given bottled water at no charge. Also, our Hawaiian Sun drink was on the house. The owner also gave us a sample of the saipan noodle soup, which was delicious and contained no oil whatsover, a rarity these days. At the end of the meal, we were given hot tea on the house as well in to-go cups. Can't say enough about the treatment of customers here. Amazing.",

Other than that service was great, but personally I thought the food was mediocre.     I took the liberty of trying their breakfast menu since I'm a sucker for the loco moco but I felt that it wasn't on par with others that I've tried elsewhere in the city.  I got my bf the Portuguese sausage with eggs and it wasn't anything special either.    However, I don't plan in counting them out just yet, I will probably be back to try their Korean side of the menu to fully decide whether or not I will be a regular.",

The japchae was the perfect texture, and meat jun really lived up to the hype. We decided to mix and match pork and squid for their spicy bulgogi combo, which in retrospect was a weird pairing. All of the portions were huge! Even though we were splitting among three very hungry young people, we had tons of leftovers. The meat jun combo alone comes with 3 full size servings of meat (teriyaki chicken, egg fried beef, and short ribs) and rice and sauce and macaroni salad.  Overall: fast service, tasty food, and a really nice casual family vibe. I'd definitely come back!",

Russell, his wife, YoungHee...they are sooo personable and really make you feel at home. We would go at least three times a week if we lived closer. If I'm anywhere near, I will call ahead and order takeout for my family. Dolsat bibimbap is our all-time favorite, meat jun, fish jun, jajangmyun, naengmyun (in the summer), the boiled peanut appetizers, steamed mandu...YUMMMMM!",

    "text": "I started off with a disappointing experience at another Hawaiian joint and after losing my appetite I was determine to try a new place and put a fix to my Hawaiian craving. Island Style was easy to find, there was plenty of parking, the outside looked kinda scary but I wasn't going to let that stop me from my new culinary adventure. Inside was full of tables to pick from that later on became occupied. The server which I think was the owner was super nice and greeted as very quickly with water and a bowl of boiled peanuts. I'm allergic but I tried the peanuts, they were tasty and salty.   The menu was sorta divided with Hawaiian/Korean dishes. I ordered some crunchy mandu to start with; they are meat filled half shaped moon dumplings that resemble Japanese gioza, they were very flavorful. Our server arrived with four Korean side dishes of unexpected banchan. The banchan included kimchi, radish cubes kimchi style, mung bean sprouts, and vienna sausages. I decided to order the famous bulgogi which I haven't had in more than 4 years since my last trip to Korea. The bulgogi was right on point just like I've had it in the past but smothered in onions which I just pushed to the side. I also got to try the katsu chicken, it was so good and crunchy, I didn't care too much for the sauce but it was decent. Both entrees came with a side of rice and macaroni salad.   This place was way tastier than Island Flavor, their macaroni salad was to die for, it wasn't bland at all. Our server came to check on us and asked us if we wanted refills on the banchan! Anywhere else they charge you but not this awesome joint. We were even offered hot tea but it was kinda warm inside so we skipped it. I can defenately keep coming back to this place. I want to try the musubi and kalbi ribs next time.",

I ended up ordering the spicy chicken, Korean style. It was literally AMAZING! It came with a generous side of white rice and Hawaiian style mac salad. And of course, some Korean appetizers, they were all soooo good! My boyfriend got the same thing I did, but with pork and his was fantastic as well. I believe it was $11.95, and honestly for that price and the amount of food you can't beat it! I will definitely be stopping here next time I'm in town.",

Me and 3 friends ventured out to Vegas for the weekend and since were all from Hawaii we decided to go on an adventure to seek out some island food.  THANK GOODNESS we found ISLAND STYLE! The second we walked into the door, the server put down boiled peanuts, BOILED PEANUTS!  I was sold from then on.  (my dad and I would always get boiled peanuts on our fishing trips..nostalgic moment). But the he continues to bring out kim chee, pickled daikon, hot dogs, bean sprouts, the works!  We almost started to get sad because it reminded us of home so much. So then we ordered some spam musubis, meat jun, chicken katsu, and ribs.  All of it was AMAZING.  The owner was such a sweet and genuine guy.  Needless to say, every time I venture to Vegas I will be stopping into this establishment.  Genuine people, amazing home cooking, what more could you ask for?  I never would have expected this place to be one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while.",

    "text": "I don't particularly care for much Hawaiian food, it's a little heavy on the Spam for my taste, but Island Style on Sahara does the cuisine justice and serves it with as much hospitality as their friends across the Pacific. Better still, only one item on the menu is over $10 and you are generously showered with large portions of free appetizers.  We were given addictive boiled peanuts and kimchee, as well as pickled bean sprouts, cucumbers, and radishes, all before we even ordered. The peanuts were the highlight, with the shells enveloping the salty brine they were cooked in so you could enjoy it with your legume. Did I mention they were free?  As you may have surmised from the appetizers, Island Style serves \"Fusion Korean Food and Island Style Loco Food.\" Though you may recognize most menu items, many will probably provide you with a learning experience, as they did for me. Don't worry, your uber friendly host will explain each item with big picture menus and photos on the wall so you aren't at a loss for what to order.  I passed on my favorite Korean dish, Bi Bim Bap, in favor of the Hot Spicy Beef soup ($9.90). This was served in a massive bowl filled to the brim with shredded beef, glass noodles, mushrooms, scallions, and egg simmered in a paprika broth (think Korean goulash). It was hot and spicy for sure, but not overwhelmingly so, and it kept growing on me sip after sip. Ian ordered the Meat Jun ($8.25), which we both agreed was even better. This dish consists of pounded beef marinated in a sweet and salty shoyu (soy) sauce, that is then coated in egg and pan fried (think paillard francese). It is served with rice, bland macaroni salad (a Hawaiian staple), and more of the incredible shoyu sauce. If you eat meat, get this.  We were honestly shocked by how good the food was as it was better than anything we had in Hawaii and there were actually some healthy items as well. The server, who I believe was the owner, couldn't have been more genuine, friendly, and competent. Even if the food wasn't good, we still might have gone back anyway just because of his hospitality. If you want to explore Hawaiian cuisine in Vegas, this is definitely the place to do it",

However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door.   For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great.   My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....  My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.  The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes.  Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch.  The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place.",

    "text": "I'm no Korean/Hawaiian food expert, but this place has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.  First off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...  I ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!  I also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!  Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!",

Nice and moist.  I could eat it all day.  There's nothing worse than dry, uninspired rice.  Going to ask if they pressure cook their rice because something is going on there.",

    "text": "The owner, Russell, is very nice and readily greeted us as we entered through the doors with two cups of warm tea. Affixed upon the wall are some articles about Island Style. The original gentleman who cooked Hawaiian food for Island Style, as I found out from Russell, passed away in 2002. Russell is half Japanese and half English/Irish and his wife, Gina, is Korean. She worked with the original cook, and when that gentleman passed away, she continued on with his beloved cuisine and also decided to include Korean offerings. Russell said that there was a period of time where she was just using the cheapest canned ingredients from Sam's Club or Costco, but since he entered the business, they have been making everything fresh.   We were sitting amongst some elderly and another family and everyone seemed very laid back while enjoying their seemingly scrumptious morsels and bites.  He appetized our palates with  Boiled Peanuts: a complimentary and delicious appetizer of whole peanuts still in their shells that have been boiled in a soy-based brine with a very unique blended texture of hard and soft.  Spicy Cucumber: a complimentary, crisp, and slightly tangy side dish  Radish and Kimchee: I didn't care much for the radish, and the kimchee was still refrigerator temperature cold, but it was delicious  We ordered the  Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop): Delicious rice, perfectly runny egg, thin strips of nori, and a blend of vegetables in this super hot rock pot will make your mouth water before, during, and after! The rice touching the rock pot is crispy and just the way I like it, like a crust made from rice.   Combo (Kalbi, Chicken, Jun): standardly marinated and grilled meats, mostly tender and came over white rice  I will be back to try other items. For their prices, their top-notch service, and their intense flavors in foods down to every detail, they definitely deserve five stars.",

Gina and the kid's are back at the original location. I love it !  We had the Fried mandu, Dol sot Bi Bim Bap, Bi Bim Kook Soo (this is the only place in Vegas that I know of to get this). The best food each and every time I come here. I am glad that Russell gets a day off, but I miss \"talking story\" with him. just have to go during the week. You want Korean/Hawaiian plate lunch this is the place to go. Food is authentic, service can't be beat. Boiled peanuts are addictive. So lucky to have a go to place.",

Service is ridiculously friendly as they definitely made us feel welcome for first timers here.  Also, the food didn't disappoint.  I ordered the combo plate (a meat lovers dream).  My girl ordered the saimin and she enjoyed it very much saying it was much better than Aloha's.  We also shared an order of the gyoza/fried dumplings as an appetizer which were pretty bomby too.  Too be honest, you could have gotten full just from the banchan because they were very generous with it.  Awesome service, bomb-ass food, and location away from the strip definitely nets this place 5 stars.  I wish they had this spot in K-town =(.",

    "text": "I came in after searching on Yelp for a decent Hawaiian restaurant near my office. Looking for a restaurant that compares to Island Sushi is difficult in Las Vegas, so I looked for a four plus star restaurant. The restaurant is compact with wooden tables, wooden floor, and little room to move in. I started thinking that maybe I should go to Diamond China for their delicious steamed fish. I got a menu to order take out... Holy!!! Korean food?! Great! I am tempted to order here now being a fellow Korean.  I got the spicy chick (Korean style) with the hopes that it compares with my mother's. Brown rice added. The server came and gave me boiled peanuts and water as I waited for my order. This is the first restaurant in Las Vegas that I have been to with a boiled peanut appetizer. Amazing!!! So far, so good.  Korean spicy chicken is usually only good if the bone(s) are still attached to the chicken. I took some boiled peanuts to go along with some sriracha sauce to mix with the brown rice. The chicken is delicious although it came in chopped thigh pieces (no bones). I was quite amazed at the flavor of the dish. The take out order came with kimchi (kimchi is good, but better at Mr. Tofu) and macaroni salad as well. I think I could have gotten more chicken pieces, but it was definitely worth a try.  I am excited to check out the soon dubu as it will be compared to Mr. Tofu.",

At home as in giving you the TV remote to change the channel, bringing you boiled peanuts when you politely decline (and then letting you take the peanuts home because you didn't finish them) and chatting with you when things have calmed down for him.  And it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is delicious as well!  During my visits I've gotten three banchan: radish, kimchi and bean sprouts.  All of it delicious, all of it hard to not ask for refills; gotta save room for the entrees!  I've had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the Fish Jun.  The Bibimbap delivers well, and the Fish Jun portion is huge!  Two very large filets battered and fried.  Not only was Russell generous with the fish, he also kept offering to bring me more rice when he saw I had eaten it all!  He seriously wants to do everything in his power to make sure you enjoy your meal, and he does that with flying colors.",

The bbq chicken was juicy and full of flavor! Rice was great!! (Being from hawaii rice is very important, if get crunchy dried rice its almost no sense to eat lol!) But no worries rice was cooked perfect and the mac salad with some sriracha was mean!! The guy serving us was very nice, always making sure we were ok. He sounded like he was from hawaii but didn't ask, will next time though! After we paid he even gave us some otter pops!!! That was awesome, brought back memories from hanabata days!

The table next to us came after we did and their service was the complete opposite. Their servers came smiling and genuinely appreciated them.    In addition to that, the food was a little more than mediocre. Obviously, I cannot expect the exact same quality and flavor that I am used to to back home, but maybe the poor service ruined that.   I doubt I will go back since they are about 30 to 45 minutes away from me. It just doesn't seem worth the drive for that kind of service. I will just have to wait till I fly back-to Hawaii to get my fix.",

Their stir fried seafood over rice was huge. You will never finish this by yourself. The best menu I tried here so far was Korean style sweet and sour pork, Tangsuyuk. You can choose different kind of meet for this- beef, pork, chicken, and shrimp. A friend of mine who tried the beef one told me that pork one is better and indeed the pork one was very good. I think even those who don't like pork may like the dish.   What I am most impressed by was the servers. Through out the meal we were helped by thee different servers constantly. They were very observant of all our needs and were so quick to respond to our requests whether that be needing more forks or napkins. They also offered extra kimchi dish for us after learning that we were Koreans. They also offered raisins and animal crackers at the end of the meal just because!!! Overall it was a wonderful experience interacting with them. I definitely recommend this place. Make sure to pay a visit when you are in vegas",

Made my stomach hurts and didn't even eat it all. It came with a scramble egg and it was nasty! Macaroni is bad too. Idk why most of these people here gives them 5 stars. I should've read the reviews. They charge for food that is not even good. Wth is that.. they don't even ask you if are done with your plate. They just grab it whenever they want it to. DONT COME AND WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!",

    "text": "Decided to stop by for a final meal before my flight back home, and the food was decent. My mom and I were craving pure Korean food, so we ordered a combo of the tofu stew (soondubu jjigae) and Korean ribs (galbi) along with a side of dumplings.   I felt like the location is geared toward non-Asians, because the food is decent, but not as amazing as the reviews indicate. I have had much better Korean food (with a larger selection of side dishes) elsewhere at a cheaper price.   Overall, I had no severe complaints. I finished all the food we ordered, and I left with my taste buds and stomach satisfied. However, I probably wouldn't visit again due to the quality/price ratio.",

    "text": "I've seen Instagram pics (obviously InstaFood is important to my eyes) about this place and I will forever be keen on trying (local) Hawaiian eateries here in Vegas. Especially when I see meat jun on the menu.  One \"Aloha Friday,\" two of my friends and I were off and since we were in the area, we came here as they just opened.  After reading all the reviews on this place, I expected it to be a \"hole in the wall\" but, it was quite spacious with 10+ tables. I could see how it would be small when it gets busy but, it's not as small as a \"Hawaii hole in the wall\" would be.   Anyways, when we first entered at 11:15 (15 mins after opening, there was already a couple people waiting on their orders.  The gentleman that greeted us (I assume, the owner) told us to sit where ever we wanted and had so much energy that he basically told us the favorites within 5 minutes of sitting down.  I already knew I was going to order the meat jun.  Since another friend couldn't decide on what to order, she just ordered the combo.  And my roommate ordered, fish jun AND luncheon meat with eggs.  - Meat jun was good that the meat and egg batter was sweet. Slices of meat was thin but, thick enough that it didn't fall apart from the egg.  The meat jun sauce wasn't to my liking tho as it isn't as vingegary as Jun's meat jun sauce but, the meat jun itself was good enough that I could eat it without sauce. ******If I could eat Island Style's meat jun with Jun's sauce then life would be perfect. - The combo was good that the chicken and kalbi had a good marinade as it was sweet. - Fish jun was good for my friend but, not my cup of tea. He loved his luncheon meat meal out of the two as he hadn't had luncheon meat since being a kid in Hawaii.  The banchan (Korean side dishes) is better than most places as they had boiled peanuts. Can I just tell you that I haven't had peanuts in FOR-EV-ER! Kim chee radishes and bean sprouts were yummmmy, too! Not to much spicy and wayyyy crunchy :)  Oddly enough, the best thing about the whole meal was the hot tea. We had 3 cupfuls of hot tea before we left. The owner even took the bag of tea root out to show us and told us how to prepare it.   I was so full after this meal that I didn't eat til 9pm the next night. And I still have leftovers!",

The soup flavor might be a little spicy but has a good kick to it.  The seafood jam bong is much better than the beef jam bong.  Didn't touch the beef at all after one bite I could tell it wasnt good quality.  We always visit this restaurant on every vegas visit which is quite often.  It's a good place to eat.   It used to be much friendlier when Russell was there but after expanding the restaurant it's never the same service.

Anyways...  I went inside and we were greeted happily and even asked if we wanted to watch the football game that was on, and of course I did, so he sat us right in front if the tv. He just got some points from me just by doing that. Their menu isn't too extensive but their food was pretty good. I ordered the combo, which came with a kalbi rib, a piece of chicken, meat jun, macaroni salad, and rice. My dad got some sort of noodles which were really good too. I wish I knew what they were called, but it came with some sort if black sauce and some sort of seafood too.   Our food came out promptly. I was happy with my portion and I was also happy with the service. They checked up on us regularly, gave us siracha without asking, and gave us cold water when we ordered hot tea. That's bonus points right there for me. To say the least, I was pleased with the service and food. They didn't do anything for mento not like them or what they were doing. I can tell you, I will definitely be back some time. I highly recommend!",

I ordered some Hawaiian pork with a side of macaroni salad.  The pork was overdone and crispy like it had been cooked before.  The mac salad was very salty.   The hubby ordered a noodle bowl and said the noodles were not cooked and it was just okay.    Prices are not \"cheap\" for the value. We spent $30 and it wasn't worth it especially for the small servings.    There were lots of flies buzzing around, they did have some fans but it didn't help.  It's located in a rundown dirty strip mall-it could use a face lift.  You do get some assorted Korean appetizers but none of them were for my liking.    I usually get my Hawaiian fix at other local chains with huge fresh helpings and I just didn't feel mine was fresh or tasty.    The place was very busy with many locals but this was just not my cup of tea:(",

Do not be fooled by the shabby exterior on a strip mall.   The interior is nothing impressive either. But I'm not there for ambience. It's the food that I'm there for. And it surely delivered!  The moment we sat down, we were served the ban chan by the very friendly owner. He was such a joy! He was very patient and helpful and explained to us what we have in front of us. These little plates of appetizers were yummy! My favorite was the white crunch seaweed that looked like noodles.   The owner suggested some yummy specials but since we practice only halal/kosher meat, we opted for the seafood options. My husband is not too adventurous so he got the salmon teriyaki. We got our son the fish katsu and I got the spicy grilled octopus.   Food didn't take too long. Our son's fish katsu came undercooked and it was promptly fixed by the owner who was so apologetic.   He later even offered us canned Hawaiian drinks on the house.   The food was sooooo good! Hot and fresh!   I left feeling satisfied and would love to come back again. The friendly service makes it even better here!",

Here are some reasons: 1. Impeccable geniune service from the owner Russel who is a hawaiian native (big island) whose wife is korean.  2. Its a hole in the wall place, but neat and clean. A place where you feel safe to eat. But don't be fooled by the surrounding stores in the unassuming strip mall. 3. Price is right for good hawaiian and good korean food in Vegas.  4. Big servings! FRIED RICE IS GREAT! Spam, eggs, and all the rest of the typical fried rice ingredients.  5. Mandu - fried gyoza/dumpling type stuff which is extra crispy skin on the outsdie and delicious pork,cabbage stuffing.  6. They have kimchee that is homemade! =)   All the best homestyle hawaiian food and korean favorites (bulgolgi, spam, bi bam bop in a claypot)  The best part of our experience is the owner and his generosity. He's the surfer type, hawaiian, laid back - he's your uncle kind of guy that treats like your his old friend. Offered us complimentary katsu with our meal and brought out extra soup for our table of 4. Most generous guy.   They have another place located downtown near the korean stores, we must check it out next time we're in town.   A must go place off the strip if you have a car go there, and if you're really hungry and strapped for cash, definitely go there!",

We were all in the mood for Peruvian, yet the place we loved had closed last year.  We hopped on yelp and this is how we came upon Island Style Restaurant.  It was not far from our hotel on the strip, so in minutes we were at the restaurant.  I have to say, do not let the exterior of the building deter you or you'll really be missing out on some great service and tasty food!  As we entered, we were quickly greeted by a gentleman with a big smile, asking us if we were hungry?  He quickly sat us and we were given menus and asked what we'd like to drink.  As we waited for drinks, I couldn't help but noticing the food pictures on the wall.  I'm not  big on ordering your meal by the picture, yet that is exactly what I did. It all looked SO GOOD!  We were brought 4 different types of kim chi type vegetables and some boiled peanuts. I can still taste them! Yum!  As we asked plenty of questions about the menu, our server, who ended up being the owner, patiently answered all of them making suggestion as we went.  We made a joke about wanting to try it all, and he said \"Let's do it!\"  He was excited that we were excited to eat and try new things. OK...now to the order.  We started off with an appetizer and I'm not sure what they were called, yet they reminded me of an empenada. They were hand made that day, and I regret not taking an order to go!  As for the entrees, my friend and I both ordered the meat combo: egg battered ribeye, short-rib and chicken with spam fried rice. If you love meat, this is your dish!  I am not a spam guy, but the spam fried rice was SO good!  Another had this meat over a bed of rice dish smothered in a thin beef gravy.  I forgot the name, yet it was DELISH!  Our last order wasn't even on the menu.  One of us was hung over, so the owner said, \"Let me make you something to cure that hangover.\"  He brought out this big bowl of soup for my friend, and after tasting it, I ordered a small bowl myself!  All in all, a tremendously positive, inexpensive experience with solid, good tasting food!  We have found our new lunch spot in Vegas!    Thank you, Yelp!   J~",

After searching on yelp made a last stop here before I left Vegas and order a takeout for the road. We were served with side dishes, boiled peanuts, and water while we wait for our order. Very nice guy friendly conversation and when our order was ready he packed our side dishes with some island drinks on the house. Definitely I'll be back when I visit Vegas again. Oh the meat jun was a hit next time I'll be trying the oxtail soup. Las Vegas is lucky to have these guys!",

    "text": "I saw the above-average reviews on Yelp about this restaurant, and decided to come by to try my luck. Not so fast, because this was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have had in the last several months.   We arrived for dinner, as a huge group of 25+ people were leaving the restaurant. Service was dismally slow, as my friend and I sat there staring at the counter waiting for someone to take our orders. When they finally brought us a glass of water each, as well as the side dishes, the water was the most disgusting water I have ever tasted; either someone did not wash the glasses right, or the pipes in the establishment are filthy, because the water tasted like buttermilk.   When the waiters got around to acknowledging us, the service was otherwise pleasant and attentive, and our waitress was very helpful in explaining the dishes. Food was otherwise quite tasty, I ordered a bibim kook soo that was everything I would expect from a Korean restaurant like this.   At the end of the meal however, as I was eating some kimchi, I found an odd-looking vegetable in there, and lo and behold, there's a pickled flying insect inside of a leaf! Those cooks in the back really need to wash their vegetables better. Sorry to say, but my experience here was just awful.",

    "text": "As a frequent traveler to Hawaii over the years I can attest to the authenticity of this amazing establishment. Not only was the food perfectly prepared, the atmosphere was familiar and inviting. Full of the Aloha spirit.   I went here for lunch and was immediately welcomed into the restaurant by the owner. My brother and I sat down and were served their famous boiled peanuts. Being from the South I am very familiar with boiled peanuts and these were some of the best I have had in years. Then he brought out some Kimchi and Bamboo shoots to snack on. Wow! So good. About the best kimchi I have ever had. Yum!  For our entrees we both had the meat jun and we were by no means disappointed. It was again probably the best meat jun I have ever had. Again Wow Yummy Amazing!   The owner even brought us out some fried mandu to try, completely graits might I add. And yet again it was awesome!  If I am anywhere near Vegas or in Vegas or just stopping for a layover I will do everything in my ability to go back to Island Style. If you live In Vegas you have to try this place. I'm positive you will be immediately addicted! So so so good.",

    "text": "GO to this place, brutha. Go. Why?  The food, man. The FOOD! Bi bim bop hot pot--a stone pot with crunchy rice on the bottom, and piled with noodles, veggies, teriyaki beef, and an egg on top. I don't even like eggs but I had to go for it, mixed it all in, and I wasn't sorry. My friend had the beef jun--beef fried in a thin egg batter, unique and amazing. We were also plied with many appetizer things, just because: five different kinds of kimchi--including an extra fresh serving that the owner brought out, boiled peanuts (realllllly good), and we also ordered the fried potstickers--also done with their own unique crunchy goodness.  The service, brah. The SERVICE! From the moment me and my four pals came in, we were treated like friends. The owners took the time to ask us our preferences, explain stuff to us (because they could tell this was somewhat new to us), and brought out extra things when we reacted so gratefully to the other things they put on the table. And they just acted like we were their buds. It's been too long since I've had this kind of friendliness at a restaurant.  The vibe, mate, the viiiiiiibe. Yes, when you drive up you will look at the joint from the outside and say, \"Is this place open? Is this place even legit?\" (the window isn't see-through so it looks almost like it's being remodeled or something). But when you push through the door, everything changes: It's well-lit, clean and bright, and almost cozy. There's a happy greeting from the staff, and a comfortable hawaiian vibe.  We ate at many good places on our Vegas weekend, but this was the one where every so often when we were contemplating our next meal, someone would say, \"Hey we could always go back to Island Style...\" In fact, even before I was halfway through my hot pot, I was thinking about how and when I could come back again.    Go here. Unlike many other cheap eats, it's not a dive, it's not greasy, and the food isn't just good for the price. It's GOOD.   You won't be sorry. You'll just be delighted and full.",

We were getting stuffed but Russell also brought out Fried Mandu and a Malasada for us! Everyone is like family here so come hungry and your tummy will definitely leave happy!

The owner was extremely pleasant; I havent had such homey service in a very long time, he obviously cares about his customers.  The Korean side dishes exceeded my expectations, all of them were good.  Jiajungmyun (black bean noodles) are delicious! Soonduboo had very good flavors but wasn't spicy enough for my personal preference. The fried saimin was amazing.  I decided to rate this restaurant with three stars because, even though the food was decent I wasn't blown away. I understand that the restaurant is a mom and pop style but the overall restaurant wasn't very clean, the menu was absolutely disgusting!",

Also left us a pitcher of water to go with our glasses of ice water (I prefer to have a pitcher at the table). - Combo plate was large with 3 types of meat, rice and mac salad. - Also gave us some Asian style (steamed) peanuts. - It was a lot of food for what we were paying. - Also, you're allowed to bring your own beers (we didn't but the waiter explained that the 2 other patrons with the beers brought them in themselves).

The food was awesome, very tasty and piping hot.  Food took a while but, it was worth the wait.  Good food takes time to make and our waiter which we found out was also the owner kept us informed that our food is coming out shortly.  Take all of his recommendations on what's good and if he ask you if you want some hot tea. Say yes, it's a special blend of tea and unlike most places, they try to keep certain things a secret, but when we ask what kind of tea it was, he told us and actually brought out the bag and showed us and I still cannot find it in LA... Keep up the good work, we will be back!!",

After being seated, we were given  boiled peanuts.  They were addicting!  Russell came over and gave us some suggestions.  The three of us ordered the bbq combo, hot rock pot bi bim bop and fried rice omelet.  The bbq was nothing special, the kalbi was a little salty.  I loved the bi bim bop and the spam filled fried rice omelet was very tasty.   The prices were decent and the portions was plentiful.  You won't leave hungry.   Russel was friendly and provided great service.   He even gifted us with more peanuts.   We have found a hidden gem in Vegas.  We will absolutely be back on our next trip to Vegas.",

Waited a few minutes.  Aunty Gina sat us down.  We were greeted by Braddah Russell, who was so friendly.  He took our order and came back with little dishes of kim chee, radish kim chee, fish cake, peanuts, bean sprouts, hot dogs w/onions.  Then later came back another type of kim chee, which he cut in front of us.  Wanted to try their fried mandu, but were out.  Raincheck.  We told Braddah Russell we would be back, especially for their mandu.  Went back for dinner on Monday night and yes, their mandu is to die for...friend or boiled.  So ono!  Their food that we had on those 3 times eating there was onolicious!  Mahalos Braddah Russell and Aunty Gina!  We will definitely be back on our next vacation.",

    "text": "I read the reviews, and decided to give this place a try, as it was the highest rated Korean food place in Vegas on Yelp. This hole-in-the-wall is nestled amongst the seedy massage parlors and stripper clothing stores. GPS led me right to it. They are opening a new location at Spring Mtn. and Rainbow this week, so try that one if you're looking for more ambiances.   Korean food in Vegas is usually sub par and way over priced. This place was a complete surprise and a wonderful new experience. Not a place to take a first date, but a great place for home-style Korean and Hawaiian food. The menu said fusion, but the dishes were not really fused. Korean food was just like mom makes, and the Hawaiian food was just like I've had in Hawaii. Didn't see anything like Moco Kim-chee bap.   My group of 5 enjoyed everything we ordered. Here is the breakdown:  Me - I ordered the Loco Moco. Although I've only had it at chain stores like L&L and Ono Hawaiian, I can say that Island Style's is hands down the BEST. The gravy is awesome. It is Loco Moco, so I'm definitely going to gain a few lbs from it, but it wasn't as heavy as the chain versions. Highly recommend.   Wife - Soon Du Boo. Excellent. Just like the local spots in L.A. Very authentic.   Daughter (6yrs old) - Spam and eggs. \"Yummeee!!\". If you like Spam and eggs, how can they get it wrong?   Sister - Curry lover say the curry is as close to home made as she's had. She is so picky that she doesn't even like Curry House.   Mom - Madu Guk. Even my mom was impressed with the taste. She said it tasted really homemade.   Overall a wonderful place to stop to get a great meal that tastes very authentic.  Husband is from Hawaii, and the wife id Korean, so they really know what they're doing. The fact that the menu had both styles made me real nervous, but the tastes were not sacrificed in any way. The hospitably was top notch. Both the husband and wife were super friendly and overly generous with the side dishes, tea, boiled peanuts, and even gave a dish of fried wontons for us to sample. The kim-chee was super authentic and the pickled cucumber was awesome. As soon as we got close to finishing a dish, they brought out another heaping dish.   Enjoy!!",

All the food we ordered was delicious and was a nice change from the expensive strip fare that is common for Vegas.  The peanuts that were brought to the table before the meal were addictive.  We finished the first container and were immediately brought a second.  Their tea was special as well - brought in from Korean supermarkets in Los Angeles.  Will definitely be making Island Style a regular visit whenever we travel out to Vegas.  Well worth the 7 minute drive away from the usual craziness of the touristy strip.",

I wanted to speak with a manager to inquire about a charge on my credit card, and she just said 'manager not here' and hung up on me. I called back to find out when the manager or if anyone could help me and she yelled like my mother would yell at me asking how I know about the restaurant and how could I have been charged if I haven't been there. What? I just told her I ate there a few days ago. Anyway she yelled again that she is busy and hung up on me again.  They were super friendly taking my money but when there is an issue they certainly don't care.  I ate here twice. Both times the black bean noodles were way too greasy (was trying to give it another try).  The champon seafood noodle soup was ok but just because you throw in a bunch of seafood it doesn't impress me if it isn't quality.  The kimchi fried rice was ridiculously salty so I just took it home and mixed white rice with it.  I think the great reviews exist due to personal taste, and Hawaiian style food is usually cultural not something most people like.  It's not like Italian or sushi where quality is a must, because from reading some reviews about this Island restaurant, quality is not a standard...cockroaches and dirty diapers? Definitely not appetizing.",

So my search for amazing Hawaiian food continues on the 9th island called Las Vegas! :D  I've been living in Las Vegas for a month now and every week that goes by,,, I'm coming across new businesses to get my grind on! Love it!  Came here recently with my ex roomie from LA... she never had Hawaiian food before, so it was exciting for me to have her go through the experience with me driving.  I was craving Kalbi, so I went with the Kalbi and meat jun mix plate :)) and I suggested my friend to hit up the fried noodles!  Russell is super nice and to top it off... he's from Hilo on the Big Island... ahhh small world... I'm from Hilo! He knew my uncle too! funny, but not surprising.  Free parking. Casual dining. Indoor seating only. Great customer service. Helper picture menu.   You'll def find the Aloha spirit here!  I can't wait to come back and try other yummy local food!  Stop by Island Style for your local fix (hawaiian & korean) ... tell Russell I sent you!  Mahalo Island Style for making me feel like I'm still back home in Hawaii!  - Miss Yelp 2011",

    "text": "This is my second time returning to this restaurant. I ordered the Kimchi soup with pork belly and my friend got the bibimbap. The food is decent, piping hot, but it's a little pricey for the amount of food you get. Customer service wise (which is why I took off a star along with the price) was at first not that great. The waitress asked if we were ready to order but we didn't decide yet and she didn't come back to take our order and we had to wave her down after 10-15 minutes. If it wasn't for the gentleman that took care of us toward the end of our stay, I'd give this place a 3 star. He was very friendly, stopped by to ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks, and came back to check on us unlike the other waitress. The first time I came here was MUCH better.",

    "text": "So my friend and I were craving Hawaiian food and we ended up here. It didn't really hit the spot for what I was in the mood for. There wasn't actually that many Hawaiian choices, it was more Korean and some Chinese.   They did give banchan, which was interesting. They had Vienna sausage as one, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about that. It felt kind of cheap.   We ended up just getting a spamusubi and shared chicken katsu. The spamusubi could have used more sauce, there was very little and it just felt like eating spam and rice. My friend ended up just dipping it in the sauce of the banchan. The seaweed seemed like it was harder to eat than the ones I usually get at other places. The chicken katsu was okay, nothing amazing.  On the plus side, the service was really nice. They made sure we had what we needed, but it started to feel too attentive. Everyone in the restaurant left and my friend and I were the only ones in there with the employees. They all started to stare and if started to feel like they were trying to close or something. They weren't, I guess they were just staring.",

    "text": "I really didn't expect to find good Korean food out in Vegas. I mean, yeah, there are Koreans everywhere, but I'm from LA... Koreatown... etc.  But I was thoroughly impressed with Island Style.  We didn't end up ordering a lot of the Hawaiian style food, but next time I do want to try the meat jun or the loco moco.  My boyfriend and I ordered naengmyuns and his sister ordered a dolsot (stone pot) bibimbap. It was a hot day! The naengmyun was delicious and so refreshing!!! I really enjoyed it. The bibimbap wasn't bad either. She didn't add in the gochujang (sweet spicy Korean chili sauce) at first because she was intimidated by the deep red spicy-looking color, but once she did, she loved it.  We also ordered a short rib side to share. It wasn't the Korean style galbi I craved with my naengmyun (gal-naeng, anybody?!?), but it was still good.  The banchans were all good as well. And of course, the boiled peanuts were awesome. Flavored just right.  It's definitely a place for the locals. I kind of felt out of place, being from out of town.  The service was on and off. Some of the servers were attentive and good. But the server that took our order completely forgot the sweet and sour pork (tangsooyook) my boyfriend wanted. We ended up cancelling that order because it just never came out. Also, I felt that the Korean workers were nicer to the Koreans. Even though I am Korean, I spoke English to the non-Koreans I was with and I felt that it cost me some quality service. But what can you expect... that's how most Korean restaurants are anyways.",

    "text": "I have had my eye on this place for a long, long time. And why I waited so freaking long, I have absolutely no clue.  We pulled into the parking lot and I thought I would just run in and see if they had a to go menu so we could look over a menu to see if we truly wanted to eat here. They didn't have one but the lady told me to take my time and look over one of their menus.   Instead, I just went back to the car and told my hunny and son to come in. I mean we were here already, why not.   They were pretty busy when we first got there, or so I thought.  Time would teach me very well that I was wrong in my assumption.  Glancing over the menus, they have a good selection of items. Mostly Korean with hint of Hawaiian items. What won me over is that they had American items for me to choose from for my son.   I settled on the hot rock bi mi map and my hunny got a regular bi mi map and for an appetizer we order Mandu. The kiddo got fries.  While we were waiting on our Mandu we were served some boiled peanuts which were so good. Art kind of looked at them weird because he had never had them but once he tried one he couldn't stop eating them.  Next came our cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, sesame bean sprouts, and some kind of stir fried hot dog.  I am a HUGE KIMCHI FREAK. This stuff was amazing. Other than it needing more heat (for my taste) it was extremely flavorful and still crunchy. I basically inhaled Kimchi and kept eying a jar that they had filled in fridge with that stuff and wondered how much they would have sold that jar to me for.   I concentrated on the kimchi for so long, I didn't realize that Art had ate almost all the mandu and bean sprouts. Mandu had come out sometime while  I was lost in heaven eating that kimchi.  I was pleasantly surprised with the mandu. I didn't know what to expect for the filling but it was a noodle, veggie mixture deep fried in a pot sticker wrapper. They were hot and crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.   My hot rock bi mi map came out and you could just hear the sizzle and smell the rice getting slightly burnt and crunchy. They dressed my bi mi map once it arrived to the table and that was nice.   Art's bi mi map came in a huge white bowl and looked almost better than mine but I knew that I had the crispy rice to look forward to. My egg was slightly under cooked so it could finish cooking in the hot rock. My mouth is literally salivating now just thinking about it. It had a nice combo of meat and veggies in it. I meant to take a picture of it but I couldn't stop eating it.  When they brought out my son's fries they were sure to tell me that they didn't put any salt on it. I thought this was very considerate. They even brought him an otter pop at the end of our meal.  I don't know if our bowls were too big or we filled our selves on kimchi, peanuts and beansprouts and mandu but we had to go take half of our bi mi maps to go.  This place was a big hit for me and the fact that it was a huge hit for my hunny says a lot too. He doesn't love Asian food as much as me, so this definitely says a lot.   The only downfall to this place is that they are small and get crowded, I mean no seats available crowded FAST! At least they did the night we were there.   We will definitely be back. There are no ifs ands or butts about this. I want to go back and try some of that fried fish and bulgolgi I was eying on other plates.",

The place is packed and we were still greeted by the owner and instantly we knew he was an amazing person!   The sides were instantly brought out in abundance to keep our starving stomachs happy until our order comes out. He gave us both versions of kimchi. And we loved both. The white seaweed was new for me, but I enjoyed the taste.   I got a big bowl of seafood deluxe, #41.",

Super tender, perfectly cooked (nice crispy edges, but juicy meat). Very very good...easily the best I have had so far.  I really like the bulgogi here too :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/island-style-las-vegas?select=R5SJdQki0qihBEhbcRLlcw#R5SJdQki0qihBEhbcRLlcw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/isla...</a>  For the same reasons...it is very tender, perfectly cooked with the crispy edges and juicy meat.

Also tried a fish dish...sorry, don't remember the name, but it was a full fish on the bone.....Cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor.  Of course, the service is one of the best you will find in Vegas.   It is cliche, but you WILL feel like you are family here. I love coming here...one of my favorite spots in town hands down!",

Island style is a restaurant a couple miles off of the strip that looks kind of run down from the outside, and not much to look at from the inside either. I was brought here to try food that was Hawaiian, but also Korean  ...huh?!?    Regardless of what type of food it was, it was super tasty!  I ordered the teriyaki beef plate.  It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The beef and the macaroni had great flavor.  The rice was rice, and tasted like rice should.  The curveball was that they served Korean style vegetable side dishes, like kimchi, to go along with the food.  They were okay, but the real highlight was the main entree.  I am still salivating over how delicious the beef was, and I can't wait to have it again.    Island Style is not the type of place to take someone who is vacationing in Vegas if you want to impress them...unless they really like flavorful food! Thankfully I do! It was an awesome find, and a great new place for me to go whenever I want to venture off of the strip.",

Recently I had a serious craving for meat Jun after a fellow yelper posted her delicious plate on Instagram and I remembered how much I loved this place! We have been coming here for years and they never fail. Whenever we want good island food or quick Korean food this is a good place to come. They have delicious loco moco, hamburger steak, bibimbap, and my favorite Korean meat Jun. Meat Jun is basically tender beef dipped in egg pan fried and served with a soy dipping sauce. In Hawaii you can find it on any menu but in Vegas it's hard to find. I love the fact that they serve banchan with all the menu items because I'm obsessed with banchan and Korean food in general. This place has expanded since my last visit which has been quite a while but they are busier than I remember them being before. Regardless of all that when your craving island style Hawaiian Iran food this place doesn't disappoint. Just a tip you might have to park next door in the eyeglass parking lot and walk over as this shopping lot gets busy and rarely has parking.",

I'm glad the owner brought over the radishes and kimchee while I waited for my Kalbi combo. I usually like to eat them with my rice but I needed to snack on something quick!  They were really good it had just the right amount of spice in it.   The Kalbi combo came with macaroni salad and white rice. The portions are pretty big so I ended up taking half of it home. The Kalbi was nice and tender and the mac salad was tasty. I also liked the fact they served regular hamburgers so my husband can eat something that is familiar to him. When I usually take him to Asian places to eat and he orders a hamburger they usually taste sweet which he finds awkward . He says the burger and fries here are good and they are cheap too!",

The Kahlua pork with cabbage was greasy and salty with too much fat. And the shrimp in the spicy noodle tasted like dirt. And the decor is so old fashioned and run down looking. Like a restaurant stuck in the 80s. Service was ok. But don't go near closing cuz they might turn you away so they could close. Overall I felt the restaurant was overrated.",

The staff was very attentive and helpful even with packaging our to-go's ! When we were leaving the two women at the counter (looked very busy counting money and other) stopped and smiled and thanked is for coming in and enjoying the food! I LOVE a good staff!!

    "text": "MOST EXCELLENT Korean restaurant.. probably the best one I've tried in Vegas. I've ordered a myriad of things in the 2 visits and they've all been damn good. My favorite has been their yukgaejang (spicy beef soup), which is almost on par with my mom's. Oh, their spicy pork and squid stir fry is REAAALLY good. As in my mom, who doesn't like pork, likes it, and my husband, who doesn't like squid, has no problem plucking out the pork. Their Korean-Chinese dishes are also very very good.. their jjajjangmyun is second only to Young King's version in Los Angeles. Oh, and their loco moco tasted almost as good as the version I last had on the Big Island.  As a testament to how good this place is, my folks moved out to Vegas about a month ago, and this place was the first Korean place they checked out on their own, based on the to-go order I brought back for them the day of their move. My mom likes their soon dooboo, and said their kimchi is also really good.   Pay no heed to the neighborhood nor the strip mall location of this place, as their food is on par with some of the Korean restaurants in K-town Los Angeles. Yep, that good.",

    "text": "\"Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.\" - S. Weil   A wonderful spot for great tasting food on a no-frills budget.  We came to Island Style looking for Jajangmyun (Wheat noodles in a black bean sauce) and Seafood Jjamppong (Wheat noodles with spicy broth)...we found really good versions of both of these dishes as well as some other pleasantries.  The Jajangmyun was made with love. I tasted exactly how I imagine my Korean grandma would make it...if of course, I had a Korean grandmother... Needless-to-say it was great! Jajangmyun is a highly pleasing dish. The black bean provides great flavor, but also makes for a nice thick sauce--coating the noodles as well as your tongue...and who doesn't enjoy the occasional tongue coating? I enjoyed this dish more than the Seafood Jjamppong, but the Jjamppong was pleasing too with all kinds of seafood swimming in a delightfully spicy broth.  The service this night was on point--attentive of our needs and even fulfilling some of them before we realized there was a need...recommendations, drinks, utensils, side dishes, condiments, to-go boxes...everything taken care of. The banchan (side dishes) were a little more hit and miss then I am used to, but these rotate, and the overall experience more than made up for this area.  This certainly not a place that would draw me in on its own. The facade is simple and cheap looking. The interior is modest as well. But the food is priced according to the humble appearance of the restaurant, not the quality of food. As such, it is a welcome spot in my rotation.",

    "text": "Came to this place on whim, craving Hawaiian food but not the typical fast food type that is arpund where I live. I've driven past this place a few times going to Diamond China and Herbs & Rye... and the Yelp reviews were a end deciding factor. Seemed to be a small family owned style restaurant that has regular customers as many were greeted/chatted with for a bit. We came at opening 11am last weekend and it got fairly busy with the first half hour, with half the tables being filled.   I would definitely say this place caters to more Korean style food than Hawaiian, but I'm not complaining! Boiled peanuts come standard as an appetizer while waiting for your food. We both ordered the combo which included kalbi short rib, meat chun, bbq chicken, rice and mac salad. Everything on the plate was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. We also got a great variety of banchan that included kim chee, pickled cucumbers, seaweed, bean sprouts, and what looked to be some kind of pickled citrus. All were very tasty.   Soda comes in cans here, but at least only $1.50. They also carry Hawaiian Sun cans as well. The only spots were they lost me were the kind of slow service and the price. The price is quite hefty than what I'm used to, with each combo plate being $17. As for quality and taste, superb. I'll definitely be back.",

Being from Hawaii, I LOVEEEEE my meat jun and have been searching for something that hits close to home. Nothing has even come close here in Vegas, but Island Style still does it right. Very large portions and good side dishes will keep me coming back for more.   They have a very extensive menu of traditional Korean items as well as local favorites like loco mocos yummmmm.

I was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.  Island Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!  I also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.  Island Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!  Hawaiian!  Oh....and Korean!",

The menu is in Korean translated into English and like all really authentic places there are a few additional items offered only in Korean.   We all ordered soups. My mandu soup was delicious. My son's seafood soup was also delicious but some of the clams did not open up so they could not be eaten. Wife's soup good also. The service was friendly but food delivery not ideal. My soup was delivered first, and a few minutes later my son's. I was half finished with my meal when my wife's food was finally delivered.   If you can find a place to park, I'd recommend giving their food a try.",

    "text": "Island Style is a Korean establishment masquerading as a Hawaiian restaurant masquerading as a Korean restaurant. This type of fusion fare certainly is a unique one as most Hawaiian food has a heavy Japanese influence. In the end, comfort food is amazing when prepared by people who know it best. The inviting servers here sit you down as if you had just stepped into their home. Our waitress was reminiscent of my Korean friend's mom who would feed us her home-cooked meals.   The menu is filled with some Hawaiian favorites such as spam musubi and loco moco, among others, but the other half offers Korean dishes such as mandu (Korean dumplings) and meat jun (egg-battered meat; also with a fish option). As with any Korean restaurant, the table is offered banchan and rice water tea. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the meat jun was, especially with the flavorful and tender thinly-sliced beef. If you're seeking a noodle dish, the black bean noodles were some of the best I've ever had. The eclectic food was fantastic and I can't wait to return to try the rest of the items on the menu!",

And from a Korean establishment I wouldn't expect anything less than great.   I also had the tofu soup. Big portion. Very good. Definitely one of the better ones I've had! Could've fed 2 people.   The ox tail soup was okay. Nothing special.   The spam musubi. Not great not bad. Just plain regular.   The fried saimin. You don't have many places that serve this so it was very refreshing to see it. So we had to try it. Very large family style portion.  Toppings were tasty. Noodles were kind of bland. Almost chow mein like. They gave it a nice try. But it's not reminiscent of the islands if you know what I mean.   I'd give this place a 3 but they were very nice and service was fast.   I'm always a little skeptical when Asian restaurants have more than one type on their menu (I.e. Korean, Hawaiian, Japanese) but hey that's Hawaiian food in a nutshell so we gave it a shot. Not a place I'd put on my list to come back to since were from out of town, but it was definitely worth a try. If you love Korean food and Hawaiian food then this place is worth a shot. Bummed we didn't get to try the meat jun because that is also very rare to find.",

Potstickers... not so great but the deliciousness of the meat was far to superior to give them a 4star rating.  I was really full when we went here... and good lord did I eat a ton. I just kept eating and eating and eating and eating and.... well you get the freaking. The meat was perfectly marinated and was accompanied with some delicious onions that were soaking in the marinade.  I really wish I could fully explain the experience I had here, but suffice it to say that all you need to do is stop looking at the screen turn on your GPS and get here just to try it.  oh and ps... the random ass macaroni salad that came with the meal was really good to. Not to sweet or salty but the perfect food to cleanse your pallet to get you ready to stuff SOOOOOOOOOO much meat in your mouth.  THE VERDICT: best bulgogi I have ever had? maybe. best spicy pork I have ever had, absolutely. and if you are able to make me even question is this the best ever it makes me think. maybe the best korean fusion place I have ever been to. welp... see ya later.",

I'm so happy that he introduced me to this simple yet super tasty dish that I have just fallen completely in love with.  Thank you Jeremy C.!  Every since I had it at 3 different restaurants in Oahu, I had to find one in Vegas.  Verdict: Island Style does not disappoint.  It is almost as close to the meat jun served at Millions in Oahu.  Flavorful well season beef inside a hefty egg batter served over white rice or fried rice!  Don't forget to dip it in their tasty sauce for an amazing trip in your mouth!  Their dumplings here are a great appetizer too!  And the workers here; I believe a family that used to live in Oahu, are super nice and friendly.  We chopped it up with them about the Islands and food!  My boyfriend and I will definitely be back for the meat jun and to try their other menu items!  They're straight from Hawaii so I'm sure the rest of the food here is legit!  Yum!",

    "text": "This place has great food and AMAZING service. I had dinner here for the first time yesterday. I flew in from Denver looking for good Hawaiian comfort food. This place had lots of options but I ended up getting the teriyaki salmon. I was expecting to just get a plate lunch, but I was pleasantly surprised that this was a sit down restaurant. I was greeted by Russell who brought out six mini dishes of kimchi and things. He brought out napa cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout, daikon, some kind of crunchy mayo seaweed thing, and boiled peanuts. I've eaten at Korean restaurants before but I usually I expect to pay at least $25 in Denver to get all of the kimchi sides with my meal. The prices here range from about $2.75 for a musubi to $16 for the generous serving of teriyaki salmon, and a bit more for the kalbi. Typically, I have to keep asking for refills for the kimchi at other places but Russell was really quick to fill up the mini dishes without prompting. When he came by the first time, I had a few pieces of cucumber left and he came by and took the (not quite) empty dish. I thought he was getting ready to clear the table but he was just filling everything up before I ate the last bits. If this isn't amazing customer service, I don't know what is. When the teriyaki salmon plate came, there were two good sized pieces of salmon, a light teriyaki sauce on the side, a bed of rice, and mac salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a very light consistency - with a sweet (but not over powering) flavor. I was skeptical about the sauce because I'm used to eating a more viscous teriyaki sauce. So I dipped a small piece of salmon in it initially just to try it. Then I ended up dumping the sauce on the salmon and rice, it was that good. My toddler was sleeping in her stroller but she woke up literally right when I finished the last bite of my meal. Russel asked if he could bring her a small plate of rice and hot dog. I said yes. I didn't know that he meant a COMPLIMENTARY plate of rice and hot dog. After our meal, he served me barley tea. That was good too. I also ordered spam musubi and chicken musubi to go. I felt the True aloha spirit at this restaurant and will make this my \"go to grindz\" place whenever I come to Las Vegas! I attached pictures of my meal, the kimchi sides, and the menu, check 'em out!",

    "text": "Island Style serves up affordable, delicious bibimbap and banchan with attentive and sweet service. This pocket gem can be hard to find and I was finally notified of its existence when my co-workers suggested it for lunch.  My favorite parts of a Korean meal are the complimentary banchan plates and hot tea and this place delivered. The standard kimchi, sprouts, and pickled cucumbers tasted sour and \"fresh\". Surprises included tasty diced franks sauteed with onions; boiled peanuts; steamed broccoli; and salty, dried tiny fish. But don't expect all of this in one meal. Every visit yielded different banchan plates and that's totally fine in my book.   The signature bibimbap was executed very well. It's served hot and the medley of diced vegetables, sliced steak, steamed rice, and a fried egg came out perfectly like Kim Yuna landing a triple lutz. The serving size is ridiculously generous and I NEVER finished.  It's served two ways: regular bowl ($8.95) and hot spot ($9.95). I personally liked the regular bowl better because the hot pot can turn the rice super crispy and that those little suckers will get stuck in your molars. But the hot pot is fanciful and the sizzling caused me to oohh and ahhh. Definitely, a dish if you desperately want attention from others.",

Him being a Hawaii native, I took his word and decided to try it out.   Russell and Gina are one of the nicest couples you will ever meet. Russell comes over and greets you with some boiled peanuts which are so addicting. We always order the combo and fried rice omelet which tastes amazing. My most recent trip my combo plate was a little too salty, but I didn't want to speak up. I'm so happy for them that they expanded into the space next door vs how small their place was when I first started going there. Best hospitality in town you feel like you're practically family!!",

    "text": "\"MAH SHI SUH!\"     \"ONO!\"  I just haadd to say \"delicious\" in both Korean and Hawaiian.   Island Style is quite the hole-in-the-wall. Now I am aware they have added a new location in the Greenland Supermarket food court, but I urge you to try it's original location first. It's a little mom and pop restaurant located in the middle of an older business complex. It seems very modest from the outside, as the small establishment is covered by highly reflective film on its storefront. Nonetheless, from the moment you walk in, there's a overwhelming feeling of coziness. It is furnished nicely with wood flooring and homely decorations, which provide a nice and warm environment to eat in. It reminds me of being in someones own kitchen, especially since the owners are extremely genuine and welcoming.   On to the goodies. I've been here several times, and it's often a struggle to decide whether to choose something from the Korean menu or the Hawaiian side. Both are equally solid. I have a few favorites on the Korean side, the stand-outs being the Casseroles and the Cold Buckwheat Noodle soup (Neng Myuhn), which is THE BEST IN TOWN. I live in the far Southwest side of town, and when I get a craving for Neng Myuhn, I take the 20 minute drive without hesitation. For those of you who haven't had this dish, you might be a little intrigued over a noodle-based soup that is served... well, cold. It is mainly a summer dish, but plenty still enjoy it throughout the colder seasons. The ingredients are fairly simple. The soup consists of a beef broth, is chilled, the served with thin and stringy buckwheat noodles. The garnishes are what really tie this dish together; sliced lean beef brisket, julienned cucumber, sliced Asian pears, pickled radish, and half of a hard-boiled egg adorned with sesame seed sprinkles. You are also presented with white vinegar and hot Korean mustard paste, both are things that I add to mine. The reason why Island Style's Buckwheat Noodle soup reigns supreme is because their broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles glutinous texture is just right, or \"al dente\", if you will. If you haven't had this yet, and are a fan of Korean cuisine, I strongly suggest you try this, regardless of the temperature outside.  Island Style's Hawaiian fare also delivers, and it's apparent because this place is frequented by Vegas's local Hawaiians. I've tried most of their offerings, which consist of the usual favorites. My personal go-to dish tends to be the mixed plate, with the Meat Jun often being the first to disappear from my plate. I do recall them having a few specialty Hawaiian items on Thursdays, such as Kalua Pork & Cabbage and Ahi Poki which were delightful as well.   There really isn't much else to add, except.... BOILED PEANUTS?! OMNOMNOMNOM. Oh and the Fried Mandu (Pork Dumplings) are also worthy of being labeled best in town. Hand-made daily.  Anyways, Island Style never fails to provide a quality meal in warm, homely atmosphere by owners who really seem to enjoy taking care of their local, and first time customers.",

I'm always greeted with some boiled peanuts (yum!) and some water or green tea while I wait for my food.  I've been on the search for some good hamburger steak/loco moco and I do have to say, it is one of the best that I've tasted here in Vegas.  The gravy tastes homemade, not from powder like most. And the hamburger is yummy, but a bit overdone.  I need to remember to ask for it to be cooked medium.  Even with my drive home clear across town, the egg is always perfectly over easy.  Also, the have some super delicious fried noodles.  That is also a hard thing to find out here.  Whatever we order, we ALWAYS have to have an order of fried noodles to go with our food.  Most places seem to use a lesser quality noodles when making this, but yours is perfect!!  We're still making our way through the menu, but so far, everything has been great!",

As soon as I got there they served us water and boiled peanuts (sound weird but they are good). They also served Korean appetizers such as kimchi, seaweed salad,and bean sprouts. My bf and I ordered cold noodles and bulgogi. Not only was the food good, but service was excellent! I am not a local but felt very welcome by everyone that worked there.

While Island Style's menu certainly  holds its own against its competition, its True advantage lies in its affable, long-time owner, Russell.  His enthusiasm for his offerings is as unprecedented as it is well-deserved.  My family and I have enjoyed nearly every item on his menu, and we have yet to be disappointed.  During our most recent visit, Russell even went so far as to invite us to call him if we ever would like to try to cook one of his specialties at our home in Houston.  Not a chance!  We shall continue to let the master do his work in the kitchen while we sip hot tea and eat boiled peanuts in his dining room.  Do not be fooled by the storefront and off-strip location.  Island Style is the best bet that you will ever make in Las Vegas.",

After giving us some menus he went and got us some boiled peanuts and waters. He explained the menu and gave us recommendations based off what we said we liked. Before our food came out he brought us some cabbage and daikon radish in a slightly spicy sauce which was very tasty along with some bean sprouts. Our food came out very fast and was exactly was amazing. The owner explained how the food was to be eaten and what sauces were best on what foods. After all was said and done 2 people ate two very filling meals for $20 and will return again!",

Everything was delicious, but the meat jun is what stood out to me. I have never had anything like it before. My mouth is watering just thinking of it.  To wash off my delicious meal. I had the Hawaiian Sun Mango Orange. That too was addicting. I had two cans in one sitting. I am normally just a water drinker. The owner was also very friendly. I loved how he called everyone \"Brotha\" and \"Sista\". It made me feel part of his ohana. Island Style makes me wish I was a local.

He's a really upbeat guy who greets you when you walk in the door and is really helpful with deciding what to have.  He asked me if I was hungry and he immediately told me to get the combo when I said yes.  Boy was he right, it was delicious, and the perfect amount of food, and for $9.50 I feel it was a great deal.  I would recommend listening to what he tells you you should order, and I really like that he explains what everything is if you've never had it before.

Split a combo with the bbq chicken, meat jun, and kalbi, some fried saimin with spam(best way to get it), and the hot rock (dolsot) bibimbap between two people (a steal for around 30 bucks.. PLUS LEFTOVERS!)  The chicken and kalbi were delicious, and you really didn't even need the dipping sauce that came with them. Moist, savory, and slightly sweet. It was the first time I had ever tried meat jun, and it was great. I happen to love eggs though.   The bibimbap (you have to get the one in the hot rock/dolsot style, because you mix it together and press down to get the rice crispy!) was great. Definitely ask for that spicy/sweet paste to add a couple dollops before you mix it in. Really legit bibimbap.   Fried saimin was also good. Great balance of flavors and it was slightly salty and mild. Spam is the real way to get it, you get to experience the saltiness of the spam flavor with the slight sweetness of the cabbage and kamaboko (fish paste cut into strips, the pink and white stuff), and richness of the egg. They gave us a TON of this stuff.  They also served us boiled peanuts (which were delicious), some kimchi and kimchi style raddish, and some nice palate cleansing broth.   I wish I could have eaten everything. I'm definitely getting the curry or loco moco to go next time.",

HOWEVER... their food is pretty good. I have not really had anything at Island Style that I didn't like. I especially like their deep fried dumplings.   They have a hodge podge of Korean, Chinese, and Hawaiian food. It's a good place to take someone that can't make up their minds. Ha. XD  Their portions are pretty good and it's pretty nice for a larger group, for food portions and price.",

While waiting for our food, Russell the server there brought us over some boiled peanuts which was really good.  Since we were korean he offered us an older fermented type of kimchi.  Service was really great and Russell was very attentive to our needs. I give it 4 stars only because my soup was not very authentic.  I would probably return again for some other korean dishes.  UPDATE: 7/27/12 my coworker brought  me mul naeng myun (buckwheat noodle) which is served chilled.  It was actually very good and I was very impressed.  I would probably go back again when I'm in the mood some other korean dishes.",

It's located in a small sketchy looking plaza, and may get crowded at times.  I ordered the bulgogi plate whereas my friends got the meat jun combo. Our meals came with a small assortment of fresh banchan. I really liked the kimchi, seaweed salad, and boiled nuts. Before our entrees came out, I was already full from stuffing myself with the banchan.   The bulgogi was very delicious! I enjoyed every little bit of it - even the leftovers. The meat jun was pretty good as well. And all for around $10. What a steal! My only gripe is that they mixed up my order, which led to a bit of a delay with my entree. But luckily the banchan was there to satisfy me in the meantime. Also their cups have a strange yellow tint we just could not figure out.",

I called back right away after i took a small bite on the food and i talked to the guy who took our order and nicely told him the food wasnt good and the chicken was so thin with no meat on it so i asked for my money back ( $19 for something that wasnt good i get paid that much at work but thats an hour of my ass working for throwing it away just like that ) and he told me : I TOLD YOU TO ORDER THE COMBO ONE AND YOU DIDNT LISTEN TO ME SO ITS YOUR FAULT NOT MINE & all i said is : im not gonna get something you want me to get so i got What I Always Get EVERYWHERE I Go To Eat This Type Of Food so let me talk to the manager please and he said I am the manager actually i am the owner actually and its your fault not ours so at the end he just said to bring the food back which i did and when i walked in a lady was next to him and he said : She's actually the boss and i was like wtf? Thats not what you told me over the phone liar so the lady looked at the food and gave me my money back. Bad experience ever. And i even told him over the phone , i rather get my money back and give you back the food than just making a bad review on internet , i wasnt gonna do the review but i am because he was rude and a liar.",

    "text": "This was my first time having Hawaiian food. I went by myself a few weeks back on a Saturday after a long day of errands. I met Russell (the owner) by the end of my meal I wanted to call him Uncle.  First I started with a nice helping of boiled peanuts then came the banchan all dishes were nice and cold. I didn't have time to finish all three before Uncle brought three more out. I eat the boiled peanuts slowly because I wanted to take the rest home, not knowing that Uncle had another batch for me to take away. I was able to have a late night snack when I got home.  I don't think that I've ever seen boiled peanuts served other than in Florida (the south). A nice addition.  I had the seafood soup. It came in a big bowl pipping hot with a big ladle and a cup of rice on the side. Uncle gave me instructions on how to put together the dish. It was a little spicy and the shrimp was a tad small but very filling. For under $10 bucks. The veg was crisp and clean. Would order it again. The broth was red so be careful slurping.  I paid my check with a very pretty girl at the desk and was on the way out when Uncle brought a plate of cold sliced watermelon. We chatted about the menu and what I can order next time. Due to the fact that I don't eat meat. He was so warm and accommodating that I'm going to look Uncle up again this weekend.  So ,of you are looking for a down home place to kick back and feel like you are at someones kitchen table. This is the place, no frills but it hits the spot.",

Based on reviews I decided the wonton min and the combo seemed like a good place to start. I was not let down! The complimentary kimchi was tasty and the sprout appetizer was my personal favorite.  They have a big selection of sodas for $1 and Hawaiian drinks for $1.50.  It didn't take long for the place to fill up and it seemed they did many take-out orders.   The combo was huge and each variety of meat was tastier than the last. The wonton min was large and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive and I never felt rushed.   I will return here.",

The meat jun is like an omelet and it was nice too. The grilled chicken was petty much standard grilled chicken. Island Style is a fusion Korean and Hawaiian restaurant and I guess that showed in my meal with the inclusion of macaroni salad with the meat and steamed rice. It was nice, too. There were only two banchan dishes, white radish kim chee and cabbage kim chee. But the dishes were quite large for banchan. The white radish kim chee was a stand out. It was a pretty good version. The kim chee at Island Style is not especially spicy but still good. If I were to go back, I'd skip the combo and just order a plate of ghalbi. But it looks like there's other good things on the menu, too.",

    "text": "Hands down, one of the best Hawaiian restaurants I've been to. I live in LA and they have a ton of Hawaiian restaurants but this one stands out by FAR! What makes this place so great is not only the food, but the GREAT, TERRIFIC, AWESOME hospitality. The owner here just makes you feel like you're family and right at home.   The six of us ordered a bunch of different dishes and shared. Here is what we ordered:  1. Loco Moco (hamburger and egg on top of a bed of rice with gravy) 2. Fried Rice Omlet 3. Bim Bim Bop  4. Fried Saimen 5. Chicken Katsu 6. Fried Mandu (homemade, the owner was so nice to let us try this on the house)   Everything was delicious! I mean the Katsu was crunchy, the fried saimen contained the freshest ingredients (spam, cabbage, kamaboko, saimen noodles, eggs, etc), the bim bim bop had great flavor, the loco moco had some pretty awesome tasting gravy which made the dish so good, and the fried rice was great (something so simple tasting so good just tells you how good it is).  I don't know exactly what was in the fried mandu but man did that taste good as well. I don't even know what more to say except that I would highly recommend trying this place out.   Later in our trip we had Hawaiian food again at the California Club, Aloha Specialties and man, Aloha Specialties doesn't even compare to Island Style! Come here! Best meal of the trip :)",

    "text": "Pull into the parking lot of a most unlikely location. Approach a restaurant that looks both scary and closed. Open the door and catch a whiff of food that will make your belly happy.  Best dive in Las Vegas!  And maybe even some of the best ethnic food in Las Vegas.  I had the bulgogi. It was a generous portion of bulgogi done right and seasoned to perfection. Heaping mounds of white rice, and the even the usually dreaded Hawaiian macaroni salad was good.  But the best part? The owner made me feel like an honored guest, bringing me 4 kinds of homemade kimchi, some kind of Korean tea, boiled peanuts.   I love people who are passionate about what they do. I love people who are passionate about serving up great food. And I love people who put care and love into their food, whether it's a fancy restaurant, or a little dive in an unlikely and nearly frightening location.  5 stars to Island Style. This will become a frequent haunt.",
