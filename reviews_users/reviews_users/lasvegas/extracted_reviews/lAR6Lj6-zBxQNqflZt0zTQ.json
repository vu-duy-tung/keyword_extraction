    "text": "My sister was visiting from Australia and has a thing for Buca so we ended up here.   Caesar salad- disappointing that they got rid of  serving anchovies and lemon on the side since that was made it into a good, real Caesar. It's not that hard to keep small cans of anchovies around since they keep for ages.   Caprese salad- it's standard and hard to screw up. The components were all fresh.   Stuffed mushrooms- in a huge portion restaurant it came with 6 small crimini mushrooms. They were decent, but nothing standout.   Veal Parmigiana- it was okay...the breading soggy with oil. I've had this at other Bucas, where it was much better. My brother wanted eggplant, but that was something taken off the menu as well because there's an eggplant shortage currently.  4 Cheese pizza- Parmesan, ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses were fine, but there was something missing. This didn't have sauce so it was more like garlic cheese bread. I put some more parmesan and some red pepper to give it something more.   Baked ziti- this was pretty decent with a tomato creamy sauce. Too bad this wasn't something we ordered a big portion of, but a buca individual serving that was free taste from a coupon I found on the Yelp page.   White and red pitchers of sangria- good flavors, but didn't even feel a buzz and I'm a cheap drunk.   Our server was very nice, sassy and full of personality and brought out brownies for both brothers birthdays. Even though service was good, the food was just A-OK so I can't give it more than a 3/OK rating.",

We were seated in the bar area, which is nice because I was able to watch football but we waited a long time to order or even acknowledged. It took quite a few minutes to finally wave down the bar tender who was suprised that she had a table and nobody told her. She went into the walk in cooler when I asked for service.   The food wasn't bad. Obvouisly it's all family style. It has a friendly atmosphere. We had a party of 3 so the amount of food we ordered was good.   Parking lot is dark. And while in Sin City, best to walk to your car fast...why? Something about that security guard that walks between Mortons and Buca di Beppo is somewhat alarming.",

    "text": "The food was amazing, but the service ruined everything. I went with a group of 4 people. When we arrived we were told that there would be a 30-40 minute wait (my fault for not getting a reservation). They ended up getting us to a table in closer to 20 minutes.   When we got our table we noticed that about half the restaurant was empty. There were only 3 tables occupied in our section so we thought things would go smoothly. We waited for another 30+ minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders. Don't worry, the drinks took forever to arrive after that too. When the drinks finally came we had to wait again.   It was almost as if they didn't want to take our food order. Finally a manger came to take our order. This was the one glimmer of hope that the restaurant had all night. She brought us some free bread for our wait and took our food order. While waiting for our food to arrive she took pretty good care of us. Brought some more bread, filled our drinks, etc. However, once she brought our food we never saw her again.   Nobody came by to refill drinks or do anything while we ate. I eventually went to the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. I had to track down an employee to order dessert and request our check. 20 minutes later we had no dessert and no check. We asked 4 different employees to get us our dessert and check. One of them eventually brought the check but it was still another wait to get the dessert.   In total we spent almost 3 hours at Buca di Beppo. Most of the time was just waiting.",

No. Okay, before I start to say the bad stuff, I'll start with the good stuff. The walls are adorned with funny pictures. They give you a nice little homey feeling. The pizza was pretty good too. Saucy, but that's no big deal. The house bread is pretty good too. I am a bread lover, and this was up to my standards. But, the spaghetti and meatballs weren't good. The sauce was weird tasting. I don't know how to describe it, it just made me crinkle my nose. The meatball didn't taste good at all. It seemed too soft for a meatball. I also had the chicken. It was VERY lemony. If you like a very strong, sour lemon taste, sure. Order it. But if you don't, do not order. Warning: COULD cause cheeks to disappear into mouth.  I sound like a little jerk, but hey. I didn't like it.",

Once we were finally seated it was another 10 before our server came to our table who then had the courage to ask if we sat ourselves since she was confused about our presence.  We were in a hurry to get somewhere and told her and she did well getting everything else to us quickly but had a very poor first impression. The food is very expensive for the quality and taste. Most entrees don't include pasta, you have to order that separate. The fettuccini Alfredo was bland and plain. It wasn't terrible but for $55 we could have gotten the same thing at the Olive Garden for $25 and it tastes much better at the OG. We'll not be coming back anytime soon.",

The best way that I can describe their food is \"generic.\"  I wasn't blown away, like I was hoping to be.  I was visiting Las Vegas for my 30th birthday, a local friend kept telling me about this place.  She was hyping it up like I was going to orgasm with each bite.  I was like \"hell yeah, I'm there!\"  Well, my short sightedness smacked me in the face like it normally does.

I ordered a small Quattro al Forno to share with my friend. The menu said Chicken Cannelloni was included.  All of the dishes served were stuffed with cheese only, except the shells. When I questioned Eric, he said the complaint was common and that \"the chicken is ground very finely and sometimes you can't tell it's there.\" I thought that was an odd response.  Looking at the menu further, I saw that the Chicken Cannelloni has spinach as an ingredient and nothing we ate had any spinach in it. As we were mostly finished with the meal, I did not press the issue. I don't know whether the kitchen made a mistake or the server wasn't familiar with the menu, but I am not sure I would return to this location.",

Came here a few times, but my most recent visit was for my sisters birthday. We ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni which is penne pasta with chicken and peas, and also has a kick to it (sooo good! Probably my favorite pasta here), the shrimp florentine which is a garlic flavored pasta with shrimp (honestly was not my favorite, tasted very placid and needed like 10 pounds of salt!), the Italian broccoli Romano which is practically just broccoli with salt and pepper, and the chicken saltimbocca which are chicken breasts served with artichoke hearts and lemon. This was plenty to feed 5-6 of us!!!   Each entree comes with either a small or a large plate. I would recommend ordering a small if it's you and one other person. Because like I said...their portions are HUGE.   Here's a tip: if you go online on their website and subscribe, they will send you a coupon for a free pasta on your next visit! Super worth it if you're always here. Make sure you check your email because that's where they'll send it, usually the day after.  Till next time Buca!",

The entrance is a little secluded so maybe they need a louder Bell for the host to hear. This was a very family oriented Italian restaurant.   Food Experience: The food comes in large portions so order to share!!! These prices seem expensive until you see the portion size. (Keep that in mind) The fold was delicious as well. We got a large supremo pizza, chicken parmesan, and baked ziti. All which were amazing and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day.   Service Experience: I can't remember our waiters name buy he was tall and slender.  But he was fabulous!!! Very attentive and nice. He came back several times to make sure we were satisfied with our food and experience.   Overall we were very happy with our experience here and can't wait to come back again.",

We were there for a friend's daughter's 21st birthday. They were out of the beer we ordered, then they were out of pizza. Yes, pizza!!! What Italian restaurant runs out of pizza at 7:30 on a Saturday night? We were in there for well over 2 hours due to slow service, and when we mentioned our unhappiness we weren't offered any kind of discount nor did they give the birthday girl a free dessert. The bill was $175 for 6 people... absolutely not worth it!!! When we went to pay the credit card machine was down. I'm not kidding. Our waitress had such a bad condescending attitude the whole time and acted like we were bothering her. I hope I never get invited to a birthday dinner here again, even if I'm not paying.   And to top the shitty birthday off, the waitress wouldn't accept the 21 year old's license because it was vertical. She had been 21 for less than a day. Geesh. Luckily the manager approved it.",

The employees are awesome here. Despite this place being crazy busy they managed the madness effectively.   The boxes and bags are super sturdy so you don't have to worry about everything collapsing on you as you walk to your car. They will give you plates and utensils and even parmesean cheese if you ask.   Seriously if you're in a pinch and or don't want to deal with the hassle of cooking for a large group you have to try Bocas catering service. I added an item at the last minute when I arrived and they didn't fret about that at all. They simply added it up and charged me.   The price point is spot on considering all of the food you get. The quality is crazy good.   Here's the 5 star factor. It just smells so damn good as soon as you get out of your car. That sweet smell only gets better the closer you get.

Then, Chef Eduardo came out and personally apologized to us. We were very pleased with how it was dealt with and even felt they had gone a little over the call of duty and then a complimentary dessert arrived at our table. It was incredible! I can't believe how much everyone cared that one dish out of our whole meal was less than fantastic. It is refreshing to see that customer service is alive and well at this Bucca Di Beppo.

Food was cooked perfectly (although I would prefer more sauce on the spaghetti). Meat was not undercooked. Pasta was not overcooked (like the Campbell location). Ordered to-go, so I can't judge the whole dining experience. Being off-strip, I hope they don't try to sell tableside photos (like the SF location). I'm visiting the city but I'm not a tourist. I just want good food. Yes it's pricey but they give you a lot.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place another try. Once again it took forever for the food to come out. The waitress barely checked on us. The mozzarella garlic bread was horrible. It left a funny taste in my mouth and was unlike any garlic bread I've ever had. The lasagna wasn't good either. Tasted like a bad microwave lasagna. The only thing that was decent was the chicken parm. I don't know why people talk about Buca so much when the service is consistently bad and the food is horrible.     First visit- Waitress was extremely weird. On top of that our dinner came out after waiting a long time and we had to ask where our appetizer was...she said she forgot about it. Then told us it wasn't very good anyway. Food wasn't good at all!",

Sat down, ordered, got our appetizers 30 minutes after ordering, and the entries took AN HOUR after that to come out. I know people are dramatic but I'm being totally serious. Our food came out super cold and bland, it was gross. My father called the manager over and he had such attitude and was not professional at all. He offered to re make our food, but after waiting forever for crappy quality, we didn't want to wait any longer. He then said \"we'll tell me what you want me to do then.\" My after became very upset and the manager walked away without offering any way to fix the situation! Our server was very attentive and we assured him it was not his fault, we were very upset with how the manager spoke to us. The manager came back and was cutting off my father with every word being very rude, defensive, and unprofessional. After countless arguments our food was paid for, and we left a big tip for our waiter for being so patient. Management needs to learn a lesson in customer service. We will not be going back to this location.",

It was a gamble to get my wedding catered by a restaurant I had never tried before but it was recommended by a friend so I figured. Lets do it.   I called only one day in advance! The general manager was super helpful. I think his name was David. But there's two David's who work at that location.  It was truly an awesome experience they were early and fast and efficient. They kid brought the food all the way to my room on a cart.  All of my guests were really impressed with the food. My son only ate the bread because he never likes anything so I thought that was nice they had a package to purchase that offered bread.  My husband doesn't eat vegetables or spaghetti sauce so he ate the mac n cheese pan. And everyone else ranted and raved about how good the spaghetti and meat sauce was and the salads and the egg plant Parmesan was absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for making my day even more special.",

    "text": "I've genuinely had great experiences at other Buca di Beppo locations, but not this one. Am I just unlucky?  Today's lunch experience was really the final straw. We arrived for lunch as a party of 2 to an empty hostess stand. There was nobody else waiting. We stood around for 10-15 minutes before a cook peeked out around the corner of the kitchen and let us know someone would be with us shortly. It was probably 5 minutes later when the hostess showed up and seated us, but it felt like forever.  Every single time I have been here, it has taken way, WAY too long for our food to arrive after ordering it. That includes today. I didn't look at how long it had been since we ordered when we finally got our food, but it was probably around 30 mins. For lunch, that's unacceptable, considering 1) how little people there were at the restaurant and 2) how the party of 2 seated after us received their more complex dishes within 10 mins of ordering.  My boyfriend's chicken was also very obviously reheated. The chicken had telltale signs: cold around the edges and extremely hot in the middle. Actually, his whole meal was probably forgotten and then stuck in the microwave. It was just sad looking. I generally like the baked ziti from Buca but mine wasn't really that great tasting compared to previous times I've had it. I don't expect a chain restaurant to have fresh-that-day-and-super-amazing ingredients but... this lunch was a disappointment.  I think our unhappiness scared off our waitress. She came by only twice after our food was served. First, she asked how our lunch was going, and almost immediately ran off before I could say more than \"okay\". Then she dropped off our check and a box after we had to ask some random plain-clothes wearing guy (the manager, probably) for it. Then the same guy picked up the check and brought back my card and said goodbye. We walked out of the place, right by our waitress, who didn't say anything. Sorry, lady. :(  I don't know. I still genuinely like Buca's tiramisu and, at least until this one I just had, their ziti. I think if I ever really desperately crave these dishes again I'll just get it to go instead of having to sit through such awful service.",

    "text": "One word---Terrible!!!  We just came from dinner there and were extremely disappointed. This was my first experience at the restaurant and I was far from impressed.  From the get go it was quite shady and unprofessional. We called about 20 minutes ahead of arriving and asked what the wait time was. We were told about 20 minutes so decided to head in.  When we got there, there was no wait and we were seated in the empty bar table area. We had never been to this location and didn't even realize there was another section to the restaurant. Our \"server\" was actually the bartender. While she was nice, it appeared that she cared more about increasing our bill instead of our experience. i.e when we asked if it comes with bread the server asked if we wanted garlic or traditional, knowing full well that there was complimentary bread but wanted to charge so the bill was higher (she only mentioned that it's complimentary after we said no to their ~$10 bread on the menu, which she pointed to). In addition, our beers arrived extremely large (at least 750cc to 1L). She never mentioned that there were two sizes and just gave us the larger, more expensive beers (the bill mentioned almost $10 each!!).  We received our $24 entree within less than five minutes of ordering it (somebody said microwave). It was large and a decent size for two, however was not very tasty and was a bit cold after few bites. After our entree had been on the table for about ten minutes, we received our beers. Ten minutes after that we got complimentary bread and waters. Definitely not how the order of service is supposed to go :( The bar area was extremely cold to the point that we couldn't even finish our beers. When we got up to go to the restroom we realized that there was a much larger, warmer and vivid area (we were the only people at the bar at this point). We should have been asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or the main dining area and since it was our first time we just assumed the bar was the main restaurant.  We never saw our \"server\" at our table for the rest of the evening. She just yelled from across the bar if we wanted desert or the check. She dropped the check and never came to pick it up. After waiting more than ten minutes we went to the bar and paid because we could not sit freezing any longer.  It was terrible and we will not go back.",

I'm not Italian so I don't know if this passes for real Italian food, but I know it's good food.  We had a large group so we were able to try out quite a few selections. I was drinking their Buca Bella specialty drink, quite refreshing. We started with the Apple Gorgonzola Salad, the taste surprised me, perfect for the holidays with the cranberries, fresh apples, and spiced walnuts. We also tried the fresh Mozzarella Caprese. I'm forever a fan of their Cheesy Bread Florentine but we got the Pizza con Formaggio instead this time. And to round out our first round of food, some tender Fried Calamari with spicy marinara dipping sauce. Yum! For our main courses we noshed on Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Marsala, Lasagna, Chianti Braised Short Ribs, Shrimp Fra Diavlo, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, and Baked Rigatoni. Sides included Green Beans, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Italian Brocolli Romano. Yes, I was so full after sampling everything! All of the food was really good but the chicken and spicy pasta selections stood out to me. The chicken was very tender and moist, delicious. Ready and willing to go back soon.",

But this last visit will probably be my last, from the food to the service I just was not pleased , We placed the order based on other yelp reviews and got the spicy chicken rigatoni, it came out super fast I thought it was too good to be True, and of course it was.  It was so bland it tasted like boiled pasta, we asked to send it back and they resent it the same way, we could hardly eat it, so we asked for marinara sauce and another waitress brought it out with an attitude. And the rest of the servers along with who I am guessing was the manger on deity were discussing and contemplating who would get the next large table right next to our table in such an unprofessional way. Even the water tasted awful! All in all the only thing we actually enjoyed was the bread that came with the bruschetta ,that was really good! Yet the bruschetta was filled with onions so it killed it for me, but the other two seemed to enjoy it. Sorry Buca this was another disappointing visit.",

I saw this location on google and decided to come here with friends. They have their own private parking lot so free parking. One perk outside the strip. There is hardly a line. Second perk of being outside the strip. Due to being less busy, our waitress was more attentive and a lot of friendliness was felt.  As a party of four we got two lunch portions of spaghetti and a salad (one of each) and the small family portion of the spicy chicken pasta. We also ordered a small order of garlic bread and we were stuffed! The meal comes with regular bread but it's cold so I recommend the garlic bread. Small portion is about 8-9 sliced pieces. The large is about 5-6 more slices.  Man I wish they sold their Rosa sauce! The main reason why I come here is because of that sauce. Pretty sure that's the main reason of its popularity!",

They brought our table 4 desserts and there were 6 of us at the table. She never once asked if we'd like a refill on drinks so I had to ask her for some. Each time we asked her for things she was pissed off. When she brought my drink back she placed it on the table without looking at me and stormed off. And it was just soda and no ice. At that point I knew she was in a bad mood. Even watching her with the other tables I saw her attitude. The worst part was that she got gratuity!! Because of our group she automatically got her money. So she knew she didn't have to be nice to ANYONE and she'd still get paid. So annoying!   Another sad thing was the food was actually really bad.

Food came fast and was fresh and hot.  Our server also checked on us multiple times. Bad: there was no flavor to the alfredo sauce. We ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken. There was plenty of sauce, but, like I said,no flavor. We added a bunch of parmesan cheese and some salt to give it some kind of flavor. My husband said the chicken had no flavor, although I thought I did. We also ordered the fried mozzarella. It was almost burnt. The bread was bland, but not horrible. The best part of the whole dinner was the ice tea. We won't be going back. I'll stick with Olive Garden and the delicious breadsticks and free soup!",

    "text": "We came here on Christmas day and that was a big mistake. I honestly don't think any restaurant should take reservations if they can't handle the amount of business they'll get.   We got there 20 minutes before our scheduled reservation time at 5:30. The hostess was very sweet and she seated it right away. They sat us in a 6 person booth. But, there was so much crap on the table that it felt like we were dining at a 4 person table. After we were seated, it took our server a few minutes to get to us. We get it, it's super busy! However, the server we got had a major attitude. She was very curt and fast w/ us even when we were asking questions about the menu. We just brushed it off because we understand it was busy!   But, an attitude like that can get super annoying QUICK. She took our food. Every time she came by she would serve us w/ the biggest grumpy face I'd ever seen. I've worked at a restaurant before and I always tried to be nice even if it's busy. Life is too short to be a sour pus.   The food was okay. We got the platter, spicy chicken rigatoni, supremo Italiano pizza, stuffed shells and tiramisu. Everything was okay. The platter was the best thing on the menu. It comes w/ fried calamari and shrimp. They ran out of mozzarella sticks so they gave us extra calamari and shrimp to make up for it. The shrimp had a nice kick to it.   Spicy chicken rigatoni was cooked too al dente for my taste. The sauce was not spicy at all. The portion was HUGE! We weren't able to finish all of it.   Supremo Italiano pizza was ok. We got a small portion that was perfect for us all to enjoy along w/ the appetizer.   The stuffed shells were good especially w/ the marinara sauce it came with.   The biggest downer was the tiramisu. It was NASTY. They made a special \"Holiday\" tiramisu that looked and tasted terrible. Normally, it comes in a nice bowl w/ chocolate powder on top. This time we just got a slice that they just threw on a plate.   Overall, the experience was okay and I'm only giving them this because I know it was Christmas and it was very busy. The service was sub-par. They did the bare minimum. The food was meh except two things.   I will not come here again though for any special occasion.",

What got me so upset was when my friend asked the kitchen personnel if our food is ready after we heard him tell  a person who came after us that their order is going out next. My friend asked if our order is almost ready and a bald guy with tattoos in the kitchen responded: \"What!?!?! I don't know, I only know about her order cuz hers is a lot!\" WTH!!! So in other words, he does not care about our order or any other person's order for that matter because ours is not as many as the other person's? I got upset because we're all paying customers, small orders or not. We decided to take our business to them instead of another establishment during one of the busiest evenings of the year and this is the treatment that we get?!?!?!! This man is so rude and unprofessional, I don't even know why he's still working there.   The food is good but the service that we got from this place is very unsatisfactory and unprofessional that the bad taste of the service resonated to the food.   I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN AND NOR DO I RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION TO OTHERS. I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BRING FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO VISIT FROM OUT OF STATE HERE.",

For starters for the price of the everything on the menu I couldn't understand why the table was set with paper napkins instead of linens.The service was good, however, the food was mediocre at best. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and chicken. For the price I was expecting big grilled shrimp and chicken laid on top of the fettuccine. Instead I got small shrimp and tough slices of chicken that taste previously frozen and microwaved. The sauce was pretty bland. They served salad with tongs instead serving spoons which really bothered me as I am in the service industry myself. I just don't feel like the food was worth the price. I don't mind paying if the food and service is up to par.",

I made an Opentable reservation for 4p (figured I'd get 100 pts for that as well), and arrived at 3:45p which was past the lunch menu cut-off. I sat at the bar, the bartender was friendly and courteous, and offered me the lunch menu to order off of, which I truly appreciated. Really, he could not have been more helpful.  I ordered the standard spaghetti and meatballs (pik attached), and honestly it was pretty good. Came with a side of bread and oil.  So I have nothing negative to say, it was a pleasant experience all around. A-OK :)",

We hardly had our drinks refilled, we ordered basic items off the menu and it took them almost 2 hours to get the food out to our group... TWO HOURS.. Twice we had to hunt down staff to ask for refills and water.  Once the bill came, it came out to roughly $35 a person which included tip. Looking at what we got for $35 I would definitely not recommend dining here. The food taste is mediocre at best. For $35 we could of went to other establishments and had a 5 course five star meal. It was great to hang out with friends. We all agreed not to revisit Buca for any future group needs",

It took awhile to get our server's attention when we were ready to order. My friend is gluten free so we both ordered from that menu. We came around lunch time but there is only one lunch entree that is GF, so we were forced to get that and something from the dinner menu.  Also had an antipasto salad.  We stated from the start that my friend is gluten free, and we were ordering from the GF menu. Yet when our entrees came, there was pasta in it. The server said it was GF. Having cooked GF pasta before, and doing research on this establishment, no.. That was not GF pasta, particularly since they never ever have served it at Buca.  About 30 minutes later we got our dish again, this time with like 4 pieces of broccoli. The chicken breast (chicken limone) was considerably small. We also got chicken marsala, which consisted of 3 chicken breasts and like 5 mushrooms. Really need a starch in there. Could they not have put potatoes on the side?  I think we spent about 3 hours and $40 here, all for 4 small chicken breasts, a salad and not much else. I've read about their huge portions. Not the case for GF items.",

If you go with a party of two, I recommend just getting a salad and entree and that should be enough. If you go with more people then you could order more entrees or opt for the larger sized plates. The entrees are large because they are meant to be shared, hence a family style restaurant. If it's your first time here they will explain the menu and plate sizes to you.

SO good! it is \"family style\" dining. so when ordering a dish a small serves 2-3 people & a large serves 3-5 i believe? something like that. and the price range is between $25-$30 for the smalls. we had leftovers obviously.  the decor of this place is really something else. a little over the top & kind of tacky but hey the food is good. could i make these pastas at home? probably. but they were still super good & I'd go back.  better value than olive garden.",

Despite not seeming to be too busy (the room we were in was completely empty, at first), we had to request waitress service twice to get water and place our orders. We did not receive any food, other than bread, for 90 minutes. It took two hours to receive our entrees, and they came out slowly over another half hour or so.   The manager came to talk to us before the food came out and told us their systems were down and the 'to go' orders had been lost, so everyone who had called ahead to place orders who then came in to pick up their food had to reorder at that time. Those people I feel terribly for- they were all rowdy and stuck in the foyer when we were leaving and someone said the restaurant had closed early because of the back up. And people were still arriving with reservations.   The waitress was clearly upset and angry, and was not attentive to the table and was defensive when she was asked questions or received complaints about the wait or whether the right food was coming to the table (because total orders were not coming, just half orders then later more half orders).   The people behind us finally left after not getting any food for 90 minutes, and then only getting a tiny pizza to split for a table of ten. Many people had kids with them, and by now the room we were in was full and we were the only ones eating.   The food was fantastic. I have read the portions are huge at this place, but we did not experience that. The food portions were acceptable but not typical of Family Style in my experience. The chicken in the dishes was perfectly cooked and the chicken parm was the best I have ever had, by far. I would love to have that again, but I will never go back.",

My mom presented the coupon and the waiter proceeded to card my mom pretty brusquely. Then when we ordered our food the waiter put on an extra meatball and asked if it was ok. I mean, duh! More meatballs! However he failed to tell us that it was an extra seven dollars. Then the sauce was watery. Didn't expect much. Afterwards they sang to my mom for her bday however we didn't even get a small slice of cake or scoop of something, just a giant candle that my 5'1 mom had to stand up to blow out. The coupon even said we could get a cake but under some bs reservation conditions. Like wtf...we could've gotten a cheaper better meal at red lobster and gotten some free cake. Crossed this restaurant off our list!",

This time the food itself was average-at-best we ordered the garlic bread it was dry as dust, the bruschetta was served in such a way it was not easy to serve your self it was just put together poorly, and the flavor just wasn't there the bruschetta chicken was very good and the meatball and spaghetti very good. We had treated neighbors who had not been there before and I was embarassed that the food was unappealing as it was this is very unfortunate I won't be going back",

I was told that I would have the cardinal room which would hold a max of 46 guests.  I had 41.  I thought plenty of room. NO WAY!  I had 4 people leave because there wasn't enough seating for them, mind you I paid for people that didn't eat or drink, but it's not about the money.  We were SO crammed into the room that people couldn't wait to leave.  It was hot, the service was really slow. People left hungry. it was a disaster. Please think before you book your reception with them. I called to tell them about it and got a crazy attitude. I wish I would have known better.",

    "text": "We used to love visiting buca quite often.  The sauce and meat has its own flavor that I just can't copy at home.  Each time we have gone in the last year or so it seems to be going downhill.  Upon getting there and sitting down as i was scooting my chair in, i stuck my hand in gum, went to the bathroom to wash my hand and it smelled of mildew, but its a bathroom so maybe it wasnt?  :/  Previously we got small plates for bread and large plates for dinner, so when dinner came we stacked up our plates and the server saw us but never brought new plates so we had to unstack and use the small plates to eat on.  Our spaghetti had meat but not really any sauce.  It tasted like a bowl of plain noodles, I was extremely disappointed.  We also had ordered a large lasagna and the server, Dale, told us all that was left was a piece that was 3/4 the size of the large that he could give us and charge us for a small or wait 45 minutes.  We said ok but we're very disappointed in the piece we got.  It was really about 3/4 the size of the small, maybe he thought we had never been there but I was pretty upset.  We ate most of it and my youngest slept through dinner.  Luckily we also had pizza for.him because there was not enough left to feed him because of their lack of preparedness at 440 just before dinner rolled around.   Dale was nice but the food was the main issue this time.  We probably won't be back for a long while.",

A little over a month ago I went through Natasha and Tiffany to organize my mother's 70th Birthday surprise dinner and they were FANTASTIC!!  They made it incredibly easy communicating with them via email and the fact that I could pre-pay for the event via the internet made it very easy.  When we arrived at the restaurant every single person we engaged with was kind and so sincere with my disabled mom.  They were patient and never let on that 40 of our closest friends and family were waiting in private dining area to surprise her.  They truly helped me do the unthinkable surprise the woman who knows everything!!!  The staff assigned to our party were terrific and there was truly not a detail missed from the arrival to them personally assisting us to our car with the gifts and left overs.  I am telling you what if you are looking to entertain and don't want the mess left in your own home to deal with BUCA IS FLAWLESS!!! This is the second event I've thrown with them and they haven't just won my tummy they have my heart!!! THANK YOU BUCA STAFF!!!",

Eventually I decided on lasagna. It was absolutely delicious, best I've ever had honestly. I loved the fact that they give you the exact about that you feel you should be paying for. The prices may be a little bit high but it's absolutely worth it. On my second visit I was beyond excited I know it's already perfect although seeing the prices may scare you at first. Haha. It's all worth the trip. Every time. I'm in love with this place.",

Out of all of our places we ate this was truly a favorite. From the front hostess to Jerry *our bartender/partner of the restaurant*, our waitress & even the lady taking our picture. Which was also put on a postcard and given to us. It was amazing! Food huge portions and so tasty. Lasagne for me and chicken parm for my husband.

The spaghetti and monster half pound meat balls were excellent. We also had Bruschetta, Penne Basilica, and some other dishes.   They have some much good food to choose from that I really wished they made smaller portions or we hand more people so that I could try all of the dishes. I LOVE ITALIAN FOOD.   The walls are full with so much random pictures, they even have a pope room where if you wanted to dine with pope in the middle of the table. So be sure to look around before, after, or even during your meal.   I would have like them to serve us complimentary slices of Italian bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, as most places I've been to do, but it was extra.   when buying with a large group try buying just one of the large dishes, they said it feeds around 6 people, i might agree except i could really put down some italian food,",

Ehh. The shine is off.   It wasn't bad by any means. We just left feeling quite...underwhelmed.   Going around 4pm on a Thursday certainly has its perks, as we were only 1 of 2 parties in the entire place! So we were greeted promptly and  seated quickly. I was diggin' how the place is set up with the whole Italian thing. There was so much to check out on the walls.  They have most menu items set up as small and large. Small apparently feeds 2 people, while large will feed 4 people (or 2 really, really hungry people). We opted for some good ole lasagna and a basket of mozzarella bites. The food was just not that great. Not only that, I was really bracing myself for a good size portion and it was kind of puny for all the hype. lol  The mozzarella bites were pretty good though. we wooffed through those things before even polishing off the lasagna.  The young man who was our server was polite, friendly, and attentive. In fact everyone we came across was very nice. The issue wasn't with the service, just the lackluster food.  So, it wasn't horrible, but with so many dining options in town I honestly don't see myself going out of my way to come back here.  3 stars.",

    "text": "I went there with my Family over easter weekend.    The service staff I would give 5 stars to.    HOWEVER, This being my first experience at Buca Di Beppo, I expected at least Olive Garden Quality.  My Nephew and I shared the Spaghetti and Meatballs.  The Meatballs were yummy, however there was a complete lack of sauce on the pasta.  The meatballs maybe had a ladle of sauce, but the pasta had what I would call tomato water under the meatballs.  Not yummy!    The Pizza was crisp on the edges however the dough was soggy under the toppings.  I did like what my niece had, I don't remember the name, it was Chicken Alfredo, Sausage macaroni basically.    I would give this a higher rating however in terms of value to money spent I felt this place needs to apologize for itself.  The food is mediocre, the pricing is too high for bad food.  At least at the Olive Garden I get a fresh salad that comes with my dinner, not here, it's ala-carte.  I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $18 for Spaghetti and meatballs.    Any one who's ever been to a church spaghetti social can tell you that for $5 you can get a plate of pasta with a rich meaty sauce that is way better than this place.  While the church Spaghetti comes with a little guilt, Buca's comes with shame.  I'm sorry Buca - But this was a fail.",

We also like that they have some Vegetarian selections on the menu.  This particular location is inside the Excalibur casino, which requires the usual tempting and distracting walk through their casino to get to - Well worth it tough. We decided to try out this location, because we were walking back from the Luxor to buy show tickets, which turned out to be a \"bust\", and we were tired and hungry - So we needed some Buca di Beppo lovin to make us feel better.  We dined early at this location, so we did not wait long for a table (probably about 10 minutes at the most). While waiting, we decided to have a glass of wine at the bar, with our server providing an excellent suggestion from the wine list. Once seated, our server provided some good Vegetarian selections from the menu, so we went with the vegetable lasagna and the house salad. The food and service here was as good as expected for this brand.  BTW - If you are not in the mood for meat, and want some really hot and yummy, they their Eggplant Parmesan. It's the best we have ever had.",

We will never eat at another Bucco De Beppo again !",

Overall taste of the food was very sub par. Started with some calamari that was very dry and rubbery. Then all the pasta dishes we had were poorly seasoned and very over cooked. Good service bad food",

Went in recently and waited in the front for about 20 minutes with no staff nearby to help -this was not at the end of shift or anything so no excuse to not have a staff member at least checking for walk ins upfront. Once finally seated the staff was running around like crazy trying to take care of the few patrons that braved the dinner experience. (It was by no means \"crowded\") they had the bartender helping with orders. The kitchen was messing up orders and then fighting with the staff over it. Took over an hour to get our food. Meatballs were burnt everything else was \"okay.\" I've been to many different locations from CA to WA to NV and never had an experience like this, I highly recommend trying a different Las Vegas location - this one will shut down soon.",

Sure, talk about the portion sizes all you want, but our $26.95 per person (before tax/tip) banquet-style dinner ended up being a bunch of bread with oil/vinegar (yay, all you can eat bread?), some salad, a couple scoops of baked rigatoni, one or two pieces of chicken (mainly tasted of cheese though) cannelloni, a couple pieces of eggplant parmesan, and a small dessert.  I will say that the cannelloni was really delicious, the eggplant parmesan was about as good as you'd expect, and the cheesecake was also really good and different from typical store-bought cheesecake, possibly due to a different cheese being used. Regardless, I can think of many better ways (or one other particular way) to spend that dollar amount for dinner.",

The waitress Brittany, stated that the salad was enough for the two of us as we were going to order separate salads. She did not offer to say anything about the meals nor did she say I could not order one serving and that it was a family style restaurant. When we got our bill it was over $100. We asked to speak to the manager, Lorenzo Shaw and had to wait  over 20 minutes before he came. When he finally came he stated, \"How can I help you\" and his body language was very defensive. As I explained what happened, ( The waitress Brittany asking me if I had any questions and have I been there before). Ironically, I have in Florida and the service was superb.  He stated, \"it's on the menu\" and \"She did her job.\" First  of all the lights are very dim, it's written in the middle of the menu and I'm not trying to read/study the whole menu when I already knew what I wanted. Then he said, \"What do you want me to do for you\" in a condesending tone. I asked him to take off one of the meals and that the waiter should make it clear regardless if you been there before about the servings and pricelist  He  did as I asked and when we said thank you he just walked away not saying anything.  Lastly on our receipt it had under name-- \"Confused.' which was also unprofessional. We asked to speak to him again and he stated they need to write that for their records. I think they should  write  it on THEIR receipt not the customer's. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!",

    "text": "Ok, first off, the food and service was very good. The decor was interesting. The carpet was disgusting. Looked and smelled like it was 20 years old. So to the gripe.      We went here for a graduation dinner. We had 13 guests. 4 of which were children, 3 18 year olds and 7 adults. For a catering event like this you need to pre-order the food. Having never been to this restaurant and unaware of the portion sizes, the organizer ordered several appetizers and 10 or so entree's. When the food started arriving at the table, each entree could feed 5+ people. Do the math here. The food just kept coming. The left over food was ridiculous. Having realized that this establishment greedily and knowingly allowed the organizer to order literally 5 times the amount of food needed for 13 guests, I felt the need to discuss it with the manager.   Math= each entree feeds 5+ guests x 10 entrees = 50 Guests = 13      I asked the manager, when you know your portion sizes, and you know you are seating 13 people half of which are kids, at what point does the person taking the order chime in a say \"hey, that's plenty of food for 13 people?\" While discussing it with the manager, he poorly defended this by stating \"we've tried that and have received backlash from guests who stated\" \"don't tell me how to order food\" which sounded quite honestly like BS. He stated he would make an adjustment to the check. The organizer expecting a $400.00 check, was handed a check for $712.00 after receiving a $180.00 discount. Here's the kicker. While the wait staff was packaged the ridiculous amount of leftover food, the manager came over and stopped them and instructed them to throw it away because he gave us a discount!! WOW!",

    "text": "So the bf suggested we go here for dinner, and I was like \"hells yea!\" bc I had a coupon! This is the 1st and def last time we will be eating here!  We walked in and the first thing I noticed were the plastic flower outside of the place. SUPER CLASSY!!! LOL. We go inside and got seated quickly, I was dying of thirst from The Secret Garden visit we just had and was looking for our waiter to no avail. We were looking at the menus and another party got seated behind us, 3 minutes later a waiter takes their drink order, brings it back, and asks if they were ready to order! WTF!   We finally get graced with the presence of the same waiter and he finally takes our drink order, and asks if we would like an appetizer. My bf thinks hes money bags McDuck and orders the garlic parm french bread. I sit there in price shock, I couldnt believe how pricey the food is!! Esp since they had deco of plastic/silk flowers! I'm sitting here thinking to myself, \"I havea 10$off coupon with the purchase of 20$, one freakin plate costs 20$!\"   Our drinks and app (which were cold!) finally come and I chug down my water, I then go on to ask him about the \"Italian soda/creme sodas\" and if he had ever had one? His answer was \"Yes, but have I told you my suggestions for dinner?\" WTF! I wanted your opinion on creme sodas, not what YOU like for dinner here!!! I then asked for an iced tea and he went away. The meals here are typical italian fare. Spaghetti and meatballs (huge ones) rigatoni, baked ziti, and all that pasta. Then they have chicken and some fish, which was meh on the selection. The bf ordered a small spaghetti and meatballs and a small margherita pizza, I ordered the stuffed small prosciutto chicken breasts.   His pizza comes out and which looks yummy and we all get a piece... meh. I pile on the parm and it makes it a little better but still meh. The rest of the food comes out and I was like OMFG! Not at the food, but from the utensils that came with my chicken... a fricken bbq grill fork! My 5 year old was like \"WOW!\" I right away took that away, my son woulda had a field day! I look at my bfs spaghetti and was not impressed, pasta was al dente & tasteless and the balls were ok but nothing to fall in love with. I've had WAYYYYY yummier balls in my mouth before; I'm like a ball connoisseur I guess : )  My chicken breasts looked ok, seemed like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a bit. I made myself a plate and cut into the chicken, and took a bite......... I was not satisfied! It tasted & looked like a frozen piece of chicken cordon bleu!  It was bland and tasteless also! UGH! I  also loaded that with parm from the shaker and some salt, it was ok but still dry. FAIL! It also came with some pesto sauce which was ok, but no cigar!  The bill was over 68$ WITH my coupon!! NOT worth the money! Some people may like it because of the large portions, but the quality is terrible! Paying 17$ for spaghetti and 2 balls in insane! And my 23$ frozen cordon bleus were criminal! Horrible!! STAY AWAY! Better yet go to Maggianos and get better quality food (More food & a dessert also!) for about the same!!",

The food was super yummy and priced very affordably. If you go to the Buca Di Beppo website they will send you an offer for a free small spaghetti, alfredo or baked ziti.  We opted for the baked ziti which was delicious. My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza which he enjoyed.  We had more than enough food for us and our two children. It is not fine dining but for a family in Vegas or a large group it is a great place to go.",

I was craving Italian food and thought  this place might be good, but boy was I wrong. I had trouble with my order, the server was rude, and when I spoke to the Manager who was this little Asian man with Napoleon Syndrome, he was more rude to me than his server, and he couldn't t have been less helpful. This place is a nightmare. The night we went, it was very loud from a bus load of Chinese tourists that were brought into eat. I think that these type of tours of unsuspecting tourists, is the only reason this place is still in business.   If you do decide to go, make sure you are not in a hurry, don't look under the table, and bring your own garlic powder, garlic salt, and other spices, to add some flavor to your food. Unless you are morbidly obese with dead taste buds, go somewhere else.",

He served the table behind us and a couple were seated as we were taking our order and they were served their BILL before we were served our entree. Our server told us that our entree would be out shortly and then went to another table (who was also seated after us and left before we got our entree) and chatted with them for about 10 minutes. When he took their credit card for processing he noticed that we still had no entree on our table and clearly scrambled. He ran to get it and it was obvious that our dish had been sitting for several minutes. It was dried out and was very light on marinara sauce. We asked for a separate dish of marinara. He went to input the order behind the bar but started serving patrons at the bar instead. After several more minutes we were able to flag down Nick to ask for a manager and he kindly offered assistance. He explained that the manager had to drive to another Buca location to pick up marinara sauce because this ITALIAN restaurant had run out!   This highly disappointing experience wasn't entirely our servers fault I admit. However the situation would have been avoided if he had just communicated with us anything instead of finding ways to avoid us. Granted he took the dish off of our bill and comped a glass of wine which was nice but the damage was done. I love Buca and they haven't lost me as a customer but this location has. Next time I'll go to the location that keeps their marinara sauce in stock.",

Place was crowded filled with large party's we were one of many parties there. It took us about 20 mins to get our table, services was a lil slow but there were like 25 of us. We started with salads we got this Apple Walnut salad it was sooo delicious it was served with cheese bread also very good. When we got our main food it was family style huge bowls and plates big portions. We got the spaghetti, also raviolis, as well as lasagna and a couple other plates pretty good food wasn't the best Italian Ive had but it was still pretty good. After getting completely stuff the ordered dessert omg best part of the meal, they ordered Strawberry Cheese Cake , Tiramisu , and the Colossal Brownie Sunday i had the Tiramisu which is one of my favorite desserts of all time and by far one of the best Tiramisu I have tasted delicious!!!   Over all had a great time, this place is great for big parties and they have good food and a great atmosphere!!!",

We ordered a salad, the chicken saltimboca, and spaghetti and meatballs to share between 4 people. The salad was pretty good. Salami on it was yummy, but it wasn't anything impressive. The chicken was meh at best - $23 plate (and that's for the small!) of 3 lonely chicken breasts sitting in a puddle of lemon butter sauce. No pasta, no wow factor except the price. The spaghetti and meatballs was bland and mostly noodles. AND it was $20. Ridiculous.  We've come here many times for dinner at this location and one in San Diego and always loved it, but after today's lunch experience, don't think we'll be going back. We can make better Italian food at home for much less money.",

I will share it with the Yelp community, and hopefully save someone from having a crappy wedding reception there.  \"I just wanted to write to you about our experience at Buca for our wedding reception. My husband and I were running late to the reception and I got a frantic call from my Maid of Honor telling me that Buca swears that no wedding cake was delivered. I had to get in touch with the bakery, who called the driver who insisted that it was delivered at 9AM and he even gave me the name of the person who accepted the cake. We had to insist that Buca check the freezer for the cake. Finally, they did find it.  Our reception was supposed to start at 1PM. We arrived at 1:30, but my guests were there at 1. Our party wasn't even served salad until 2. Once the entrees came, they were barely even warm. We specifically asked for a vegan salad and entree, which is on the banquet contract, and the server had no clue what we were talking about. My maid of honor had to wait for them to make it, and be served well after everyone else.  The server barely came by. We had to hunt him down to ask for things and ended up having to flag down a different server a few times. We had 3 people that didn't show up, so we had extra food. The server didn't even offer to box it up for us, he just threw away extras that we paid for without even asking. No one offered to help with the cake or even offered us any extra plates to serve it on. We found some plates on a shelf, and had to get them ourselves. We probably would have had better service had we just walked in and been seated at a regular table.  I planned my reception at Buca because my friend had her reception there a few years ago and highly recommended it. She told me how great the service was and how helpful the staff was. This was only my 2nd time ever eating at Buca, and I was greatly disappointed with the entire reception. I just thought I would give you some feedback on how our reception went. \"  Our wedding banquet was about $600. I wish we had spent the money elsewhere. The fact that Buca was right there to make the contract and collect the money, but then ignored my email says a lot about how they do business. Please don't let them ruin your banquet too.",

I could only taste and identify the cheese and tomato sauce in the food we ate. The beef and chicken was tasteless and ground up so you really didn't know what it was.

This place is not Italian.  It is better to define it as Italian-American.  Large portions.  There is a charge for bread.  A charge for pasta.  A charge for vegetable.  I sent the green beans back because they tasted like someone poured lemon juice on them.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up green beans, but yes, they made it happen.  It was really expensive for eh Italian food.  I can make better at home.  I will stick to the authentic places in town and there is plenty.  Maybe this is the place for a large group meal for kids going to prom, not for two adults.",

I wasn't expecting it to be more than what I would any chain restaurant, but the food was so much better than I remembered. Their dishes are served family style so they're as big as I remembered them to be. We got a huge bottle of the house red wine, linguine frutti di mare, veal and eggplant parm, and big side of linguini with garlic, basil, and olive oil. We also got a complimentary birthday cake thanks to the coupon. We also had enough leftovers for an entire meal the next day.   Overall the 5 Star review is really for our server, Darian. He was friendly, helpful, and did a superb job taking care of us. The food gets about 4 Stars. I've read some of the other reviews, and if you're expecting authentic Italian food cooked by someone's Italian grandmother, this ain't the place.  With that said, the food is still pretty tasty, and it won't break your wallet.",

Started to order food and our waiter just walked off to get us water while I was in the middle of talking to him. Appetizers were good and received in a timely manner. Main course took a lot longer with some items cold.   Our table was close to the waiter/waitress station and the conversations were highly unprofessional but staff members. Staff complained about the ordering system, customers, and the sangria. Not sure why the sangria, but oddly enough they did. Saddest part, the table next to us sat for 15 min before the waiter acknowledged them. They walked out. No leadership at all with management hiding in the shadows. Don't waste your money. I hate to say that because my family and I have been going to the restaurant for 20 years. I will not go back.",

If you have a party of 4 or 5 you can easily feed them a appetizer and entree for under $70 total. With that being said if you're less than a party of that size you won't find much value in eating here. The prices are about $20 for ANY appetizer and $25-32 for any entree. Of course, they are meant to be shared but smaller parties are stuck taking food home.   We ordered baked ziti which was $28 and over priced for the flavor and execution of the dish. Tasted more like Mac and Cheese with a hint of tomatoes.   We weren't impressed overall with the food or prices and will stick with Maggianos or Battistas Hole in the Wall.",

    "text": "We were excited to be in town; my wife's brother was getting married. The rehearsal dinner was held at Buca di Beppo. I was prepared to enjoy a delicious, Italian dinner. I tried to pace myself, knowing that there were probably going to be many courses.  Throughout the night, two servers were on the ball and granted all of our requests. They were friendly and helpful (especially considering there were many kids in our group, including mine).  I was a fan of the very first course, a delicious caprese salad. It's so simple, yet so elegant. I love that it represents the colors of the Italian flag. Yes, I'm corny like that.  The second and third courses were salads that I wasn't particularly interested in. They were good, but not really my thing.   The fourth course was fried calamari, and it was delicious. The marinara that accompanied it was stellar, and I of course squeezed fresh lemon over the top. I was already thinking about trying to save room for the entire meal. I knew that they were going to go all-out (after all, you only get married once [in theory]).  The next course was a spicy chicken pasta. The pasta sauce was good, as well as the chicken (although some people thought it was too spicy). I liked it.  Course number six was a shrimp pasta. It was quite good. There was a lot of savory shrimp inside, and the sauce was tasty.  Everyone began rubbing their tummies, feeling full, and anticipating dessert. That's when the groom-to-be stood up and announced, \"I hope you all saved room for the main course.\" A lot of us laughed, but he wasn't kidding! Oh man, I ate too much already. But bring it on, they're only getting married once, right?  Out comes huge family style plates of chicken parmesan (I've lost track of the course numbers by now). I dove right in to discover it was well-breaded, seasoned, and delicious. I was really feeling full at this point when the chicken with capers arrived. It was moist, tender, and had a flavorful sauce.  Next, some succulent, well buttered broccoli arrived. I made myself eat some (we need our veggies).  Everyone was doing their best to continue eating when enormous trays of meatballs in marinara sauce made their appearance. Needless to say, no one left hungry.  At last, we had made it to dessert (most of us barely being able to move). Huge trays of cheesecake surfaced, as did tiramisu. It's safe to say we all gained a few pounds that night. Overall, it was a large, enjoyable meal. Congrats to the bride and groom!",

    "text": "We've been to Bucca at several different locations including the one in Vegas near the Luxor, Huntington Beach and OC. All have been great experiences until now. This time was terrible! From the terrible tap waters to the food--- it was not the quality we have experienced before. We had the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and a Create Your Own Pasta. The Rigatoni was soggy and the create one had pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. I was told I HAD to order a third veggie, and didn't want it. I decided to ask for cooked onions on the side. I was going to give them to my hubby who loves onions. I do not like them in my pasta.  The pasta came with the onions in it. The waiter noticed but didn't take it back to fix it. The pesto had NO flavor and was all just a bunch of oily noodles. I took one bite and was done. The only thing worth eating was garlic bread.   When the waiter came back to box up our meal, my husband mentioned that I didn't like the pasta, and there was no offer to take it off the bill or any extra piece of customer service. I am a vegetarian, so I wasn't going to eat the Rigatoni. I tried to order just a plate of broccoli and they were out it.   We overheard the family near us unhappy with their meal as well, and the waiter apologizing as he boxed up their food.   We paid $100 for tap water and food I wouldn't feed to my dog. When we arrived back at our hotel, I went and bought a slice of pizza just to have something in my stomach.   If this is how this place runs regularly (it was dead and had maybe 5 families in it) perhaps it should be re-located to a better location. Eek.",

As soon as you enter, it looks pretty small because of the smaller size of the entrance/waiting area, however as soon as you walk into the dining area it is a HUGE maze of tables and walkways, perfect for large groups or small groups. We definitely did not see any wall that was not interesting to look at.   The service was pretty good. We had a friendly waiter, and the host and hostess were nice as we entered. I think the only thing I would've appreciated was more info on how to order/what to order. Portion size was what we were confused on when it came to entrees/pastas and sides. Thankfully we came with two of our cousins that had been there before to explain it to us when they arrived a bit later.   The food was amazing! That's the best part. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with anything you order, so just go for it! We even were surprised with a slice of \"celebration cake\" and the birthday/celebration song sung by the waiters at the end of our meal. Thanks Buca for a good night :) (but please don't run out of Calamari right before we order it!)",

I am not a huge fan of the whole \"family style\" dishes where they are meant for sharing. My finance is a vegetarian, i am a meat eater... see the problem?  So we end up paying nearly 70 dollars when all is said and done. Not outrageous but for that price I would have picked an authentic Italian restaurant.   So a number of days later my finance is checking his CC statement and somehow our 70 meal turned into a 140 dollar charge! We drove over to the restaurant and spoke directly to the manager. He was able to confirm the server had \"somehow\" given herself a 70 dollar tip. The manager said he would take care of this and call us when he did a little investigating.    After a few days the manager said somehow the server had \"accidentally\" switched the tip and the total amount up. I have worked in food service before and I don't even know how that is possible. The manager said they would reverse the charge but corporate needed to do this and could take up to 2 weeks. Two weeks is an awfully long time to wait for a mistake, their mistake, to be corrected.   Eventually the charge was corrected but the company never reached out to apologize or try to make it right. That right there sealed the fact that I would never return to this location or any of their others.   If for some reason you decide to eat here keep your receipt just in case the server makes a \"mistake\".",

It was busy but we only had to wait 5-6 minutes and were seated service was good and the food was also good we shared spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread, it was delicious and for dessert we shared an ice cream sundae it was huge lol but very yummy! You were not rushed and it was a great evening! There was a big party in our section a group of nurses from the philippines a 50 year reunion they were having a blast and a little loud but it did not ruin our evening and they felt bad and kept apologizing as they left lol   I would recommend",

A photographer came by, took a shot and returned with 2 pictures and we paid ridiculous $20. But I have to say that was the best picture ever anyone has taken of me.

We started off with a salad with apples, walnuts, and a wonderful dressing with gorgonzola cheese. Then, for the main course we ordered the chicken limone and pasta diablo. Both were very tasty and much better than anticipated. I love the family-style serving and the building itself was huge. The atmosphere was perfect for a group or family outing.",

We had a waiter in training, someone should have trained his trainer.  After asking her not to take the salad, she did anyway.  That was part of my dinner.  All she could say was oh- really oh!  Main course came out in stages and we had to wait to eat so it was all there.  Family style dining, I like, but the main course should be brought out together.  Expressed my dislike for the calamari - only to be ignored.  We had to ask for our beverages 3 times before they brought all of them.  Overall, the trainee, was kind and as attentive as he knew how to be.  But will not go back.",

The bread was delicious and my waiter was helpful!   I had the Penne Ala Vodka and the Mozzarella Caprese. Delicious!

We ordered the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni per suggestions on YELP. This dish was horrible. The chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like pasta water. There was no flavor to it at all. I was there with 2 other people and they had the same experience. We couldn't even eat it so we asked the waitress for extra marinara  sauce. This still did not help much but made it somewhat edible. On top of the bad dish the staff behind us was arguing with each other on who would get the next big table. I dont think as a chain resturant you should be discussing the next big table while customers are in the room.",

So why does Open Table book reservations after 5pm? Because clearly Buca di Beppo doesn't like Open Table reservations based on our terrible experience at this restaurant.   We were seated in the bar area and didn't see a server for 15 minutes. Finally someone working the bar came over and took mercy on us. We ordered drinks, an appetizer and a main dish. About 15 minutes later we got our drinks and appetizer and we thought things were going to be okay.   How wrong we were. We literally did not see a server for the rest of our visit. We asked someone about our entree after waiting another 30 minutes and they snapped at us that the restaurant was busy. We finally got our entree after 90 minutes. We could not believe it. Servers kept walking past our table and completely ignored us. Obviously here is what happened. We were never assigned a server because the bar person who took our order didn't follow up. We waited and waited for a check which of course never came either. We had to walk to the front and ask the hostess for our bill.  Clearly Buca di Beppo does not care about customers (especially those who have Open Table reservations) and it's safe to say we will never return.",

He always came to check how the food was and if we needed anything. We ordered lasagna and Margherita pizza. Service was good and fast. Food came out hot and served in large portions. Can't go wrong with their lasagna, uh uh, layers were rich and meaty. Atmosphere is great and inviting. What a great place to eat with family. I never tried Buca de Beppo before.

    "text": "I hate leaving negative reviews but my experience at this restaurant tonight was hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. From start to finish an absolute nightmare. Remmy was completely inadequate as a server for a large party- me being a food server myself. She skipped over people, didn't take everybody's order together. Some of us got our food while others hadn't even ordered. My mom and sisters food never even came out til the rest of the meal was over. Finally we notified the manager that the entire experience was a mess thinking it would then run smoothly. Wrong. He agreed to take one meal off then disappeared leaving Remmy alone again. There were so many other staff walking around, not one ever came over to help out. Plates were never prebussed. The cake we brought for our special occasion (which was clearly ruined) never had plates to be served on. Cashing out turned into another 45 minute long ordeal in itself and my dads card was charged almost double. By the end of the whole nightmare with the credit cards the manager offered to email us gift cards. I absolutely declined. I would never in a million years walk back into that place and warn others not to either.",

The service was really good and the food came out faster than I expected it to, which is always great! This is a great place to eat with for families because you can have family styled dinner and share plates with each other.  I wasn't a fan of the sangria. It tasted like someone mixed orange juice and threw in some fruit chunks.",

Salad had decaying lettuce that had to be thrown out. Lemmon aid so week and sour. I have frozen dinners in my freezer 10 times better then this. Should have gone to a buffet.",

Considering yesterday was Mother's day and the thought of leaving home to eat out on such a busy day made me nervous since we didn't make any dinner arrangements. Everyone was so friendly and inviting. We were sat shortly upon arrival. Our family was looking for a hot homely meal and that's exactly what we got! Apple Gorgonzola salad felt like springtime with every bite! I'm eating low carbs so only a couple of bites of the Chicken Carbonara but my family killed it! Our server recommended the Chicken Saltimbocca and it was AMAZING, I'm still thinking about that lemony butter sauce!!! We will always come back for some great \"comfort home cooked\" meal and people that treat you like family and not like I'm just another guest!",

The quality and quantity of the food isn't what It was before and I mean about 3 Years ago! We didn't seem to be a priority to the server because it seemed to them like we didn't have any money. It is really upsetting when you go somewhere and they well very much stereotype. We will never go back nor will we recommend to anybody to go! People save your money and go to either Casa Di Amor or Olive Garden! We felt ripped off and unimportant! Mind you we came in when it was not busy at all!",

    "text": "I stand corrected. When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. For the record, it doesn't happen often, but when it does, I usually admit it. I have to say I was completely wrong about Buca di Beppo. I'm thankful that I'm a person of second chances. If I wasn't the person I am, I would miss out on some of the finer things this world has to offer. One of those things being, one of my new favorite Italian Spots. I decided to give this place another chance. My friend and I arrived at 5pm, just like last time. As we entered, the hostess was standing at the podium and she had the nerve to be smiling. It's been a long time since I've been anywhere where someone greeted me with a smile. Oh but she did! She was also very perky and attentive too. I like that! Make me feel like you're happy to see me lol. We were seated promptly, and once the hostess walked away, the server, Ken, came right over. He was pretty cool. He took our drink orders and brought them back fast, along with the \"free\" bread and the oil and vinegar mixture that I remember ol so well, from our last visit. He then asked if we were ready to order. We were in fact ready, so we proceed to do so. We started with the mozzarella garlic bread and Baked Rigatoni. It sounded like a beautiful combination. To be honest, I were skeptical. I was just hoping whatever we ordered, tasted better than the Fettuccine, from last time. I also was going to get into a fight with the cooks if I paid $10.99 for a cheesy-garlicky brick, and I didn't want to go to jail over food. Joking! We reluctantly started on the \"free\" bread. Surprisingly, it was soft and tasted nothing like the boot they served us last time. It was actually good. Meanwhile, Ken, came back with a salad for the table next to us. Being greedy, I called him over and inquired about it. He gave me a few details and ran to get the menu, so that I can look at all of them. He brought the menu back and pointed out and described EVERY SINGLE SALAD. Ken showed me more attention than my last date did.  So we decided to order the $14 Caesar salad. I don't know if Ken had anything to do with that or the fact that we were extremely hungry. Either way, he put it in and came back with it after about 6 or 7 minutes, a little after he dropped off our Garlic bread. Speaking of Garlic bread, I'll probably never have any bread that will be as good as it was. It came with about 15, perfectly cooked, pieces. It had the perfect crunch around the edges and the softest and moistest cheese in the middle. Can someone say worth every darn penny! It was just delicious. We almost forgot all about the salad that was sitting there all scrumptious looking. We scooped out some of it and it was really good too. It was well worth the money. Around that time, Lorenzo, the manager came around. He's a really nice guy. We chatted about my experience and I was honest with him about everything. He subsequently, apologized about the last visit. I could tell that he was really passionate about his job. I was delighted to let him know that EVERYTHING we had just tasted was perfect.  Lorenzo asked what entree we ordered. I told him it was the Rigatoni. He told me that the Rigatoni is really good but his favorite is the Quadro el Forno, which was $20. It actually sound really good. Being me, I wanted to make sure that we experienced all of the best recipes that they had to offer. We ordered that one as well. Ken brought out both entrees fast. I have to tell you, they both looked delicious. We looked like we had enough food to feed a clan of pregnant women. We took a couple scoop of both. My friend and I both just looked at each other. The food was nothing like we've had in a long time. It was just impeccable. We liked everything about the Quadro el Forno dish. The cheese was perfect, all of the pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce had the perfect spice. It was excellent. We enjoyed the Baked Rigatoni too, but the pasta seemed to have been cooked al dente. I like soft pasta, myself, but my friend thought it was perfect. We ate maybe 1/3 of both pastas and then Ken brought a \"To Go\" container, and we packed the rest. I have to say, for the record, we ate it for the next 2 days. It was just as good heated. Lastly, Lorenzo came back around and made sure everything was ok, which everything was awesome. He recommended, along with Ken, that we try a dessert. We were damn near stuffed to complicity, but we did want something sweet plus everything looked so good. We ordered the Colossal Brownie Sundae. Our face dropped when we saw that thing come out. It was bigger than any dessert I've ever seen. It had to be for a whole family. We maybe ate a fourth of it a packed it up. It was magnificent though. The brownie was warm and soft and ice cream just complimented the cake to the fullest extent. It lasted 3 days, after that day. In all, the experience was 100 times better that the first visit and the food was 200 times better. We'll definitely go back, maybe even today!!",

One of the parents spoke with the manager about needing more servers but he basically said that this is all we get.

There were about 15 of us and they seated us without everyone being present which I thought was nice since some places are strict about that.   The decor is odd and slightly off putting, it's overdone and strange at times. We were seated in the Pope room, which you can guess is decorated with Pope memorabilia. There was a giant Pope head enclosed in glass in the middle of our table on a lazy Susan. Strange/odd/bizzare are the best words to describe it.   Food, let me just preface this by saying I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it because it's hard to find good Italian at a decent price in this city. Heck it's even hard to find decent Italian at a higher price in this city. The food was bland, and it made me sad. I honestly don't remember what we ordered because it was one of those meals you easily forget.   One star for service  One star for price",

We ordered the Speghetti with meat sauce family style, You do get a lot and we ended up taking a lot home I think because we filled up on bread. We ordered the cheesy bread and we got 4 pieces under the appetizers for $13.99!!! It was the Cheesy Bread Florentine Parmesan, mozzarella, provolone, spinach, Roma tomatoes, garlic and Alfredo sauce melted on top of our house-baked Italian bread. If you go to the web page or the menu and look at this bread it has tomatoes!!! Check my picture out it had a couple of small pieces scattered over all 4 pieces. This is a JOKE!! We were going to say something but my husband was mad and said forget it , it will be our last time going here. The regular bread came out first and we were pretty hungry ate that and while we waited for our dinner which seemed to be taking forever we ordered the appetizer of cheese bread. The Spaghetti finally came out after we had ate our regular bread and the appetizer and we were by then getting full on Bread! So the picture shows how much Spaghetti we ended up going home with, Over all I think were better off going to a  authentic Italian restaurant with a good reputation than going to a chain restaurant. The service this night here was not too good. The server seemed to disappear for awhile before we seen her again. We left not too happy spending what we did and not getting our moneys worth,",

    "text": "My husband and I made reservations for October 17, 2015 for a leisurely evening out.  Upon arrival we were seated in \"the bar.\"  One generally thinks this would be for adults only but not here.  Within a few minutes, a party was seated next to us with 4 adults, two kids around 8 or 10 yrs old and one toddler.  The toddler screamed the entire meal; one of the older kids yelled every word he spoke and the other kid was quiet.  During the meal, at least three other tables were seated near them and all asked to be moved to another room because this table was so disruptive.  It took forever to get every single item within every single course and was left to sit and listen to this catastrophe in between.  The bartender was our \"server\" and when she had time, she would go check on our meal.  Now to the meal.  The food was in the category of barely edible.  What we didn't eat, we took home and the next day, just threw it away.  It was horrible.  We spent a little over $100 for a shared appetizer, a shared plain pasta dish, an order of bread, 2 glasses of wine and a dessert.  By the time it was over we just wanted out.  We will never go back to this dump again.",

Besides this attitude he had during the whole meal, he brings my tea and runs off with no sugar so after a few mins. I go get some for myself.  The food was good but he brought this partial loaf of bread and it looked like he took it from another plate and was cold and gross.  Next time he comes around I ask for a warm loaf and he starts saying something about they come like that but then says he will go warm it up like its some big deal.  This guy pretty much made our dining experience rather miserable with his miserable don't give a chit attitude.  If you don't like your job man, go find something different.",

The bread it was ordered on was done just like I like - crunchy on the outside and sofft in the middle.  The bruschetta I felt lacked Balsamic Vinegar which our waitress was kind enough to provide us with a lovely balsamic glaze that we drizzled on top - PERFECT.  The meal selection was Linguine Frutti di Mare.  My only complaint here was that I did not have enough room in my stomach to finish; which was probably due to the fact that I ate most of the bruschetta (did I mention how much I LOVE bruschetta?) and that we asked for a meatball \"just to see how they were\" and the one she brought out was HUGE!  The wine selection could use some improving, but that wont stop me from visiting another BUCA.",

But, my friend Daniella is from a very Italian family and they come here all the time so it can't be that big.  If you've never been here, the first thing to note is that everything is served family style.  As such, I've found it's much more enjoyable to go with a BIG group of people so you get a varied choice of a bunch of different things.  I went last night with one friend and we got the gnocchi and chicken marsala.  And, while the gnocchi was good, you can really only have a small portion before feeling like a dumpling yourself.  The marsala is different - it's much sweeter than what I'm used to, but still very good and is served with big, plump mushrooms.  Their salad with prosciutto and gorgonzola is fantastic, and we ordered a $10 tiramisu wondering what a $10 tiramisu looks like.  Well, we found out.  It came in a giant bowl and 3/4 of it is still in my fridge.  No, you can't have any.  It's all mine.",

She decided on Buca Di Beppo for the family style dining and the kid friendly atmosphere.  We arrived at 12:30 and of course my daughter's little DVD player ran out of batteries...so the lovely hostess offered her power outlet at the stand and even tried to hide it behind the trash can (that was super nice of her to care). We were sat almost immediately and Tracy came over to greet us. She was very friendly but very busy so our service suffered a bit (hey...she's only human...not superhuman). No biggie....she was doing the best she could.  The food was decent...very Americanized Italian but the monkeys loved it...which means we will be back. The prices were not awful either....the lunch portions are the way to go. Overall I will be back for a family dinner if I think about it. The highlight for me was the gnocchi and the smiles my kids had when pointing out all the stuff on the walls (lots to look at).",

The Calamari is made just right, in my opinion, the marinara sauce that comes with the calamari is even better than the marinara that is topped on the spaghetti. Maybe it's the spicy taste. The Tiramisu is very \"rum\"ified. The Cheese Cannoli is great in a comfort food way. The garlic mozzarella bread is so good, you might just want to eat it all night. The salads aren't all that amazing, just salad.   The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant. So.. the decor can be overwhelming for some folks, but for others (like myself), it's immediately lovable. A good suggestion is to come with a group, or at least 3 peeps. That way, you can taste more varieties without taking home leftovers (not that is it bad). Overall, this is a restaurant I go to at least twice a month.",

We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, only to realize the restaurant had mistakenly double booked the Kitchen Table. The guy from the other party was being a total d*ck, so we decided to let them have the Kitchen Table, especially after the manager (Lorenzo) said he'd let us have our own private dining room and give us a discount.  Plus, we were a tad disappointed that the Kitchen Table, wasn't really in the kitchen...kinda deceiving, if you ask me. We will book the Kitchen Table at the San Diego location next time we go, cause at least that table is in the kitchen, hence the name.  We sat down in our own private dining area and as Lorenzo promised, we were the only ones in there.  We literally had the waitress (Jennabea) all to ourselves!  It was very nice; Jennabea was fantastic and incredibly attentive!  Anyhow...so the food, as you should know, it's all served family style, and as always, it was all very delicious. Everyone loved their food, there wasn't much left on the plate.  In fact, I had to push my plate away in order to to stop eating.. ha!

There were appetizers and entrees- I don't remember what we had but I know that everyone didn't leave hungry. It was pretty neat. The decor was very gawdy- the walls were covered with framed prints against a deep burgundy-red wall. It's kinda dark at night.   I'd been wanting to try this place for a while- we have a bunch of Entertainment Book coupons for $10 off a $20 purchase. We went for  lunch this past saturday, which wasn't busy, there were three other parties besides us. You get fresh bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar. My husband ordered the lasagna and I ordered the chicken parmigiana (came with spaghetti marinara)- we got the lunch entrees @ $9.99 each. It took a little while but the server explained that there was a big luncheon (in another room) and she apologized for the delay- but it wasn't a big deal. My husband didn't finish his dish. I didn't finish mine either. It was pretty good. I like that the chicken is pounded thin. Our server was pretty good about refilling the drinks and getting us more bread. The bill was $10.80 (coupon). My husband wants to suggest this one to his dad (who's Italian). There are only two locations in Las Vegas (restaurant row- this one & Summerlin). I'm sure it's busier at night, so you might want to make reservations.",

With a party of about twenty, we ordered several large plates to share.    To start, we began with the Chopped Antipasto Salad ($15.99).  This was probably the only tasty thing I enjoyed and I definitely didn't get enough of it.  Fried Calamari ($14.99) was the next to arrive.  When it comes down to it, one can never mess up calamari as long as you eat it while it's hot.  Some of the entrees I had a taste of included the Pepperoni Pizza ($19.99), Spaghetti Meat Balls $21.99), Chicken Marsala ($24.99), and Veal Limone ($24.99).  The pizza was not good, period.  The spaghetti meatballs was not bad, and the chicken marsala was the only decent entree available.  The real disgusting dish was the veal though. Blah!  It looked bad and tasted bad.   When it came down to it, the dinner cost me $40 and I was still starving when I left.  It was such a waste!   Service was okay - not bad, not exceptionally good.  Just average.    The only highlight was the nice guys sitting at the bar who ordered a round of shots for the girls in our birthday party.  Hooray for nice guys!  (They were also a good sport too!)",

They have a ton of different pictures on walls to add a nice twist on the traditional restaurant look. We started with their garlic bread which was good as you'd expect nothing really special. Then we had three different entrees Fettuccine Alfredo, Baked Rigatoni, and Chicken Parmesan. Surprisingly on both the fettuccine and Rigatoni they tasted rather bland. I expected much more of a seasoned or spicy taste and was stuck with more of a pasta with tomato sauce taste. For the price you pay it isn't worth the flavor. The chicken Parmesan was very flavorful and  was worth the money and it saved the entire meal. Overall I may give them another chance but I wasn't impressed by any of these entrees. Think twice before you pay the price",

    "text": "Yes. 5 stars for making my lunch wedding reception so memorable and awesome! I had an early wedding ceremony in Treasure Island Hotel and my first choice of reception place is the Maggiano's. However, the booking rep there did not realized that the room I have been eyeing for a while now, signed a contract, has been booked months ahead and only advised me a month before my actual wedding day. I know, what a mess. So I contacted this branch and the sales coordinator, Ms. Shelby Hellweg immediately responded to my inquiry. On February, she sent me the banquet prices and it was really affordable. At first we are looking for less than 30 guests so she gave us the smallest room and provided some ideas. Signed the contract and she asked us if we have anymore questions.   At the very last minute, we did not realize that we will be having more guests so we needed to amend the contract. She made it ALL STRESS FREE for me and my husband! =) She reserved us the EGGPLANT room w/c can accommodate up to 72 guests. In the end it all worked out.   She was really easy to talk to and responded to our non stop emails in less than 24 hours. When we finally met her in person (the day before our wedding reception), she showed us the semi-private room, dropped of our table arrangements and she made sure that she will take care of everything.   RECEPTION DAY: -- Ample parking space!!!! -- Guests came in really early but the manager and the servers accommodated them right away. Drinks and food came in just in time. Servings are huge (family style) and lots of leftovers and allowed us to bring everything home. They assisted us in neatly packing the leftovers and even gave us some containers for our wedding cake and cupcakes.   We didn't feel rushed and everything went smoothly. The guests had so much fun and I was glad we were treated well here. I am recommending this place for wedding reception on a budget. The food is awesome for sure and the servers were awesome. Forgot their names.    Days after my wedding, I left our wedding champagne glasses and Shelby was kind enough to call me and notify us that she's willing to ship it back to us for free. They are really great here!",

Seated quickly, Jody the waitress, did a great job of settling us in.    Spot on calmari appetizer, also ordered spicy chicken rigatoni pasta and spaghetti in meat sauce with meatballs. First to reference a couple other reviews...if you order a dish that says spicy....expect spicy. This was delicious.  Servers wear shirts that say meatballs as big as your head...ok....not that big but huge juicy, delicious meatballs came on top of the pasta!  Service was great, ambiance is comfortable, food was delicious.   Lots of other dishes and desserts offered on the menu....something to please everyone I'd say.  Comfortable,  fast, tasty, great price....recommended!",

    "text": "What I'm talking about is some good ole down home Italian cooking,and a real family feeling of Welcome! I flash back to the mid-70's and how close the Burroughs of NY made ya feel like a family. And everyone comes to Mama's for dinner kinda place.  Now I have been to a few BDB's throughout the country and everyone offers some really good eats but it's the feel of this particular BDB's that shines out the rest. There generous portions are so large you'll get stuffed in no time. Here they have a choice of sizes to the menu plates. I suggest that you get a couple of the \"Family Size\" plates cause you'll want more later as a midnight snake.  The first time I went to this location was just before the holiday's and close to closing so I assumed (about 10-10:15). I brought my slave after a day of chaotic running around, The place was almost empty with the exception 3 men all talking Italian in the booth two over from us. Italian standards were playing and our waiter \"Ken\". He had a very distinctive Bronx slang and was the perfect touch that a restaurant like this demands.  Polite, patient and knowledgable, Ken knew exactly what we needed and wanted for dinner. He made us feel instantly like we were family treated us likewise. His suggestions were right on the money too.  The food and wines were very palatable with the exception of the house wine (so pay the extra $5 and get something better).  The second time was with a large group of about 10 and lemme tell you again the service, food, drinks, jokes and laughter so delicious the we didn't wanna leave after 3 hours with absolutely no pressure to go we were exhausted and ended with picture momentos of that night.  We even have hung the pictures on our wall at home.  So if your feeling hungry and want to feel the love of friends and family the go to Buca di Beppo and don't forget to ask for Ken for that True authentic feeling of Mama's home cooking.",

I ordered calamari and they were a little bit overcooked in my opinion. Italian sausage and peppers, on the contrary, were delicious. They were in the side dish section, but to me it was a real meal lol. Our server was great and was trying to accommodate my needs, too bad in the kitchen they were not really prepared ( no ranch and no tartare sauces). The service is very fast. As for the price, this place is only convenient when you go there with your entire family. So you can order one plate of spaghetti for like 30 bucks and be full. Me and my boyfriend are not big eaters, so it was a little bit of a waste for us. The sour note was that when I ordered my wine I made sure that they would bring me the house wine, it was supposed to be around 8 dollars a glass. And when the check arrived we saw that they charged us 15 dollars. Is it just a mistake? I don't think so. We will not come back.",

The atmosphere is great, the dishes are made to share with the entire table, combined w/ the decor makes this place traditionally comfortable (5/5).  Service was good, our server was very helpful in explaining portion sizes and what would work for the amount of people in our group. Deciding on what to order was the toughest part. Haha  We had a total of 5 adults and 1 child. We decided on the Buca favorites; 1 - Buca Trio Platter (Appetizer) 1 - Large Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken 1 - Small Spicy Chicken Ragtoni 1 - Spaghetti w/ Meatballs  We also shared 1.5 litter of their house red wine. Given the amount of food/drinks ordered, it was more than enough and we had a good amount left over.  The PROBLEM was the food lacked flavor, and was overcooked. The stuff chicken was dry, I couldnt even tell it was stuffed? The spicy ragtoni pasta lacked flavor and needed more sauce; the chicken was so over cooked, it looked like a raisin (-1/5). Spending $200+ on a meal and the food wasnt even half way decent...  is really disappointing. Overall I liked the atmosphere but the food needs some improvement. Not sure I'll be back.",

I love the pictures and images all over the restaurant it gives it flair and a sense of old Vegas. The low level lighting at the booth we were sitting at was so elegant too.  Our server was so gentle and welcoming he assisted us with all the menu questions that we did have. The menu that they do have is in True Italian fashion and encourages sharing which we did. The menu does specify that too that the small serving is for about 3 people and the larger servings are for 5-7. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and still took home left overs between myself and my twins. We also had the mini meatballs and they were so good that we ended up with two orders of them. The mini meatballs are made from scratch and have mozzarella inside of them.   After eating I did save room for dessert too since I have heard they do it here the best. We ordered the brownie sundae and it was huge. It was full of brownie bites, vanilla and chocolates ice cream with Carmel sauce through it. Then on top was whipped cream all over with colorful rainbow sprinkles. It does not get better than that ! It was so large that I could not even finish it, even with the twins. Next time I'll order dessert first.",

    "text": "I wrote a review on this restaurant a while back that was somewhat less than flattering and I went there again (not my choice) a couple days ago and I wanted to give an updated opinion on the place.    While this will never be my favorite restaurant (to sum up my previous review of it I think they are way too expensive for food that really is beneath what one would expect at a fine dining establishment and the wait staff lacks personality or what personality they do have is bordering on rude) I have to admit that this time we went I had a slightly better experience with them.   The food itself I again found to be somewhat marginal; don't get me wrong it was good but it was more along the lines of what I would expect in a family owned casual dining restaurant or a Fazoli's. I had the lasagna which the meat to cheese ratio was just off (think 75 percent ricotta to 25% meat) and the noodles were slightly overcooked. My father had the chicken marsala which was again good, the sauce was slightly over sweet and the chicken was slightly dry. As an (intended) appetizer which was delivered with our main course I had the caprese salad which was delicious but needed balsamic vinegar. The crown jewel though was the house Chianti which is just wonderful and the cheesecake which was diving. I truly wish we had come there for a glass of wine and desert because both of those were great. The waiter we had this time again had the personality of a wet mop but unlike the waitstaff from my last visit was pleasant enough; he just lacked product knowledge and table side manor, it felt like a robot was serving us.   I will give them a three star rating (up from two) this time because  I will say they had improved upon my last visit. That said just as the last review they want to be fine dining and are priced that way but the quality of food just isn't there.  They have a beautiful atmosphere and decor in the restaurant and it is very comfortable in there but it just doesn't make up for their shortcomings.  Once again same as the last time I reviewed them I would easily have given them a 4-star rating if they were marketed and priced as a lower to mid grade casual restaurant which I think they would do well with. But as a fine dining establishment priced the way that they are Buca just isn't at that level and unfortunately since this is what they believe they are I have to review them as I would a fine dining establishment.",

Remmy was joking around with our table and took all our requests with ease (she was serving our party of 10). Needless to say, I absolutely loved having her as our server. Two of our guests were vegan and the manager made sure to cook a special vegan pasta just to accommodate our party. The manager/cook even spoke personally with our table, to let us know he was cooking a special dish for our vegan friends. All in all, this location is wonderful and the food is just a bonus!",

The waiter came back to tell us that it would be another 40 minutes of waiting and said they will give us baked rigatoni in place of.  The baked rigatoni was thrown together with clumps of ricotta cheese and very spicy Italian sliced sausage. It was lousy. Luckily we ordered a large salad and  chicken rigatoni or it would not even have been dinner.  Very disappointed and will not return to this restaurant for a long time.   When the food was presented on the table it was as though the waiter was doing us a favor giving us the baked rigatoni. Unprofessional attitude. It was not what we ordered, so do not act like you are doing us a huge favor!",

Yes Buca Di Beppo Restaurant, it  translates into Joes Basement, hence the beginning of this review. Buca Di Beppo located, well this one is in fabulous Las Vegas, but they have locations almost everywhere, even in the U.K. Founded in 1993, I have never been into Buca before this and wow, wow for multiple reasons. I've always wanted to try Buca, and now, I did. We had a great waiter, and we seated right away, very large restaurant but a nice, cozy feel. They offer a full bar, and so onto the menu. True Italian Family Style Dinner. Very large portions being served up, so when you come, come with a group of 4 or more and hungry. They offer two options, small and large, no matter what your ordering, we started with the Fried Mozzarella, basically Mozzarella Sticks, but these are wedges, and we tried the mozzarella garlic bread, loved the bread. Onto our entree, we ordered the Fettuccine with Chicken & Italian Sausage, small up-charge for 2 meats, but well worth it. We ordered the small of everything and I could've have fed my entire family, some I've never even met before. Small is definitely big enough to feed 3-4 comfortably and possibly still have leftovers. I really want to return and try the rigatoni with chicken. They offer nice salads, all kinds of apps, and just about every Italian entree you can dream of. So, why 4 Stars you ask? Well... the chicken they have is ok, it's sliced, but it just has no flavor, wish they grilled the chicken for just a tiny bit just for the color on it in the dish. Other than that, no complaints, service was decent, ambiance was cozy, and the portion size is incredible. You will drop a few bucks here because the portion sizes are so large, our dish was a out $25 when you break it down. Overall if your feeling Italian that night and there's a group of four or more of you.. ehhh... forget about it!!!",

The food didn't have much flavor, the chicken alfredo was dry and had the least flavor of the 3 dishes. The veal was like a mystery meat with prosciutto which taste like cheap deli ham and a bunch of capers. The pepperoni pizza was the best of the 3 dishes and even that wasn't great.  The food took a very long time and they weren't busy as we were waiting we could smell something burning yet our veal was unevenly cooked.  The 2 hostesses didn't say hi or bye, they just said how many. I should've known with that first sign to turn around and go elsewhere, we wouldn't return even for free!!  If we could give zero stars we would as they have earned it!",

    "text": "First things first, I'd like to say Thank you to management and staff as they were very accommodating to us during our visit.  I hadn't heard much about this place but once I did. I just had to try it out for myself and see what all the talk is about.  Traditionally I know vegans don't really have a place in Italian restaurants due to the cuisine being primarily cheese and meats. Thankfully they had a wide variety and very a helpful waiter who made sure my choices were animal product free. But first I must acknowledge the atmosphere of this place. It is a traditional Italian home and family like environment. With what looks like hundreds of pictures of Italian culture; family, love, togetherness and the appreciation for the simplicity of enjoying one another's company during a delicious Italian freshly made meal.   First the bread with the oil and vinegar was in my option delicious. The bread tasted fresh and very soft.  I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola salad (I hope I spelled that right) and I must say this salad was absolutely amazing. Obviously I had the Gorgonzola cheese removed so I'm not sure how it tastes with it but It was sure good without it. I was able to share a small with my girlfriend and it was plenty enough plus enough for take home. To remind you I am a big guy 6'6 ft tall and I weigh 275lbs and just half of their small salad gave me exactly what I was looking for.  For my main course I had the veggie pizza and needless to say I ate the entire thing. It was just scrumptious! The best part of the experience was We having the pleasure to meet one of the managers Lindsey Luzier. She just happened to be there and made sure our welcome was a warm one. She was very friendly and accommodating. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.   From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out I was amazed and convinced that this place will definitely be a must revisit for me.",

I ordered the chicken parmigiana, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara. I usually don't care for spaghetti but it was prepared so nicely that I finished the entire serving that was given lol. With that being said, I was so full that I couldn't get through more than a few bites of the actual chicken parm, so I took it to go. I just now reheated it in the microwave though and it tastes just as good as it did when it was served fresh, so this place gets a thumbs up from me and I will definitely be visiting again. Our waiter, Sean, was also really helpful and provided wonderful service (you da real MVP Sean!!). 10/10 would recommend",

This month they were also giving away a free brownie sundae, I'll get to that later.  We made reservations which I would highly recommend, not always necessary but the Las Vegas locations tend to stay pretty busy. We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving (15 minutes before our time). We were seated in the bar area, not my preferred location but still had the Buca Di Beppo charm. The bartender was also our server and he did a great job managing all the orders he received and being on top of his tables.  The prices are quite high, all the dishes are made to be shared but even some of the pasta dishes are a bit high. All the food has always been good and consistent. For 2 adults and 2 kids we ordered 1 appetizer, 1 \"small\" pasta and 1 \"small\" chicken dish. We had leftovers for the next day lol.   Dessert was a complimentary birthday colossal brownie sundae. This thing is nuts. Pictures attached for example. The 4 of us barely got 2/3 down before tapping out.  Definitely a good spot, especially for groups as the price per person evens out the buffer the group is. Dinner for 2 would be a little much here.",

There were 4 of us and we started with a small fried calamari. Good size since only 3 of us shared it.  For main course we had a small salmon and large fruity de mar (spelling is probably wrong). They were both perfect. The sauce on the salmon was lemony with capers. I could have drank the sauce, so good. And the fruity de mar was really good too. There have been times where we ordered it and it was too spicy but it was perfect tonight.  We all shared a cheesecake for dessert which was a good plan because it is rich and creamy (and $15 which I thought was a little too much and the only downer to the meal).  But the main star of the dinner was definitely our server Eric. You know how there are servers that are never there or there way too much? Eric was perfect. He stopped by at the perfect times and our drinks were always filled. Professional and friendly. A great meal can definitely be ruined by lousy service and that was NOT the case here!!  Great experience all around!!",

We had reservations and the hostess let us know that the wait would be about 3 mins maximum as they were putting the silverware down for our party. This was not the case at all. Several people kept asking her about their reservations as well.   Once seated there were several other large parties in our section. At this point I should have known it would take awhile for everything to be done tonight. Our server was wonderful. However I think it was just too much for one person to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. She should have had help. As she was the server, the bagger, and part busser too.  We ordered chicken parmigiana, chicken marsala, pizza, chicken fettuccine, fried mozzarella, and of course cannolis. Everything except the marsala was stellar especially those cannolis.

Plan was to pick up Bucca ourselves and bring it back to hotel for girls to eat dinner after a long day of playing. Called in to place the order and ended up speaking with Julie Nguyen the catering manager and she was so incredible! She explained that as a group we can come in and have our team name on the Marquee our front and everybody eats unlimited for a $24 flat fee that includes food, beverages, desert, tax and tip! So awesome for keeping track of team expenses! When we arrived our tables for 30 people were ready and they brought salad out immediately.  There was a young men's soccer team also eating at the same time as us which was extra fun for our girls! Julie is a gem and cared about our experience wholeheartedly which is hard to find. The only suggestion I have is have more food ready quickly - our table of 8 had 1 bowl of Caesar and one bowl of mixed greens which was devoured quickly by the hungry dads and the moms waited a little longer than comfortable for more salad to show up. Other than that it was a phenomenal experience and would highly suggest it to traveling groups!",

It's family style, which economically, no matter if you're feeding 3 people or 10, isn't really practical. If just one person wants fettuccine Alfredo, you're forced to buy a platter that feeds a minimum 3 people. Then on top of that, it's relatively expensive. $33 for spaghetti and meatballs that feeds 3. I know a great place that serves an amazing spaghetti and meatballs that can feed 2 for $14.   This would be a great place for banquets or a large party for a special occasion. The restaurant is divided into a bunch of dining areas and is amusingly decorated in gaudy Italian and Catholic kitsch. Service was great and the food was good (risotto was bland but nothing a little salt and Parmesan couldn't fix). But as far as value for a couple or small family...? If you all have similar palates and don't mind eating the same thing, then give it a go. Or if money is no object and don't mind taking a crap ton of leftovers home, try it out. As for myself, I'm trying to stomach buyer's remorse.",

    "text": "I kept seeing advertisements online to sign up for their eclub and receive a free colossal brownie on your birthday so I decided to give it a try because let's face it, who doesn't love free dessert!   This restaurant serves everything family style so if you have a large party, this is the perfect spot. My family only consists of 3 people, one being a baby, so I feel like this isn't the best dinner place for us. All their meals come in small or large sizes. The small feeds 3 people. We decided to share a dish because each small entree runs about $30. My husband and I have different tastes but I couldn't bring myself to get 2 entrees that could feed 6 people, let alone spend well over $60.   We started off with the mozzarella garlic bread. It wasn't anything special and I would've been content with just the complimentary bread and butter.  For dinner we compromised on the baked rigatoni. The description sounded amazing; spicy Italian sausage, marinara, topped with mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta. When it came out, there was barely any cheese except for a spot in the middle. The sauce didn't spread well over the noodles so I had multiple dry bites. The only part that was good was the Italian sausage. It was decent but I could've made something better at home.   I had a coupon for the free brownie and also a coupon for $20 off of $40. We easily reached the $40 total but I was told you can only use one coupon at a time. Totally understandable, so we went with the brownie because it's a one time birthday coupon. I wish we would've just taken the $20 off. The sundae was ginormous but lacked flavor and wasn't worth it.   Overall, if you have a large party this restaurant is great. For a family that's small like mine and has different tastes, I would recommend somewhere else.",

We could hear him say \"just like everyone else!\" When they were talking at the bar. Like what the hell is that all about? I come here for my birthday and I get this? You guys have special offers on your website and they have issues guaranteeing it. Every time, we talk to our waiter, he would turn his back on us and talk to us that way. I don't want to play the racist game but our waiter was more friendly to the white skinned people than us brown skinned. I've never felt such a burden at a restaurant.",

We made a reservation for my daughters 8th birthday dinner she was looking forward for this dinner since she saw a video with the Sunday ice cream bowl. What is the point of having a special request area on the reservation if your not going to read it. We had requested the Sunday ice cream bowl for the end as a surprise, which we did not get. Our server was perhaps the worse service I've gotten at a restaurant in years. We ordered Garlic bread, salad and pasta. We got our drinks first which you couldn't mess up 2 waters and a apple juice, wrong he brought my daughter orange juice. I didn't think much of it we all make simple mistakes. About 10 minutes later we got are salad ( delicious!) server told us our garlic bread was coming soon. 5 minutes later we got our pasta, I asked the server about the garlic bread he said he was going to go get it. About 45 minutes went by we ate, we were done. He came by and I told him we were ready for our check and that he also forgot our garlic bread. He told us it was probably sitting at the kitchen window and he was going to go get it. I really bit my tongue from telling him what good was it for me for the garlic bread to be sitting in the kitchen window. He finally brought us our cold garlic bread ( which at that point we did not care for). I asked for boxes and our check, that took him about another 10 minutes to get. I've been a server and a busser before and I understand how easy it can be to make a mistake when it's busy, but it was not busy. Some ownership to making a mistake or an apology would have been nice instead he brushed it off as if it was all okay. Overall review, the food is good. The server really put a bad reputation for the Buca brand in my experience. I would rather go to Olive Garden for the better customer service then to plan another special dinner at Buca.",

Honestly I recieved a free coupon in the mail for their Brownie Sundae ... no purchase necessary... the picture of this Sundae was amazing.  Easy choice for me this Birthday- Dinner @ Buca di Beppo it is!  Meals are served Family style, so a small dish feeds 2 to 3 people (at least!) and the food is actually created in their kitchen.... the sauce (aka gravy), the lasagna .... the tiramisu.... and so much more!  Dawn was our server, she was great.  She was professional, informative, attentive and friendly.  Her service was top notch!    The atmosphere matched the food, amazing.  I seriously don't know why I have never come to eat here, been in Vegas for 40 plus years.... but I will be going back!  Thank u Dawn you helped make my birthday a memorable one.",

Online they made you click on what protein you wanted. Well it comes with chicken, we shouldn't have to pay extra for chicken but it wouldn't let you proceed unless you check the chicken box and pay an extra $6. We figured we deal with it when we go pick it up. I talked with the  girl at the pick-up counter, explained the situation, and she comes back and tells me the cooks added extra chicken to the bottom of our Rigatoni.  I was okay with that if they were to put extra chicken in it. Got to our hotel and unfortunately there was no extra chicken at the bottom.   Cleanliness: looked clean.  Food Quality: tasted very good. Was fresh and hot. Last we checked, they don't use Trans-fat oils, HFCS or MSG, but it was a while ago when I checked.   Pointers:  Maybe call and order for pick ups. Also, just in case, check your meals before leaving the establishment!",

A little later he came out and told us that he forgot that they were out of the mashed potatoes but they did have rosemary potatoes. I told him those weren't on the gluten free menu as an option, but he checked with the kitchen and they said they could do them gluten free so we agreed. Well, the meal came out and we were enjoying it until I took a \"crunchy\" bite of something. If you're gluten free you would appreciate the terror I had with that bite...I immediately spit it out and looked closer at the potatoes and saw a number of \"crunchy bits\". My husband investigated and realized it was breading from something. I was horrified! We spoke with the manager and he was very rude. First he told me there was not breading on the potatoes and I showed it to him and he said it was from the calamari that is also cooked in the fryer (cross-contamination in a common fryer is a huge no-no for gluten free). He further explained that nothing says their food is  gluten free (despite the gluten free menu and waiter).  After I explained that I would get very ill by what they did, he asked if he needed to call me an ambulance or if I had my epi pen with me. Seriously, dude, how are you the mgr of a major restaurant chain and be so clueless about celiacs and gluten intolerances?!? Please, please, please do NOT eat here if you need the gluten free menu.",

    "text": "We recently held our small wedding reception at this location on 2/18/12 and I would absolutely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone with ANY kind of party. First off, if you want to make a reservation for a celebration they make you sign a contract. You damn well better make sure that EVERYTHING they verbally promise you is put into that contract. The lady we talked to on the phone, Jennifer, said the rooms were \"semi-private\" and \"partitioned\" meaning that they were off to the side and that we would have our own space to mull about and have our little party. We all showed up after the wedding and from the get-go, it was a bad experience. Our tables weren't ready so everyone had to hang out in the packed lobby for 15 minutes (it was February and quite chilly outside so that was really our only option besides sitting in our cars). When they called us back, our \"room\" would have been great for a party but they had sat 3 additional tables in there with us! Instead of letting us spread out and sit comfortably amongst the booths and tables, they crammed as many of us as they could into these long booth/table combinations so that anytime anyone in the booth area had to get up to go to the bathroom, the entire side of the table had to shuffle about. When we asked the manager about this, he denied that they even offered private rooms (though I passed many on our walk through the restaurant). Instead of checking with the sales coordinator, he made us pull up our contract on our phone right there so he could point out that the contract does not specifically guarantee us a \"private\" room only that they reserve the right to make changes and only attempt to honor our seating requests. We decided to just sit down, shut up, and make the best of it. Our servers were nice and the food was good but the whole thing just felt rushed. We were still able to get up, have a little toast, and hang out but you could tell the other 3 tables in there with us felt really awkward about having to share their space with a party that they were clearly intruding on (though it was no fault of their own). When it came time to pay the bill, the jerk-manager begrudgingly gave us a discount for the inconvenience. My sister and I noticed that this included a reduction in the servers' tip.  When we asked jerk-manager about it he looked quite disgusted and made the snide comment that \"everyone is going to have to suffer for this.\" I found it to be absolutely unacceptable that the poor waitstaff who makes $2.13 an hour had to suffer for their mismanagement so in the end we left them a rather large tip. They couldn't clear us out of there fast enough, while we were all trying to get our coats and say good-bye, we were having to dodge busboys slinking through trying to clean so they could seat another large party. We ended up going with Buca because Maggiano's required a much larger reservation fee for an actual private room. In retrospect, I wish we would have gone with them, the price would have been worth not having to put up with that manager.",

We made a reservation online 4 hours before and when we got to the restaurant the hostess said \"we will have you seated in a few moments\".

(Mind you, we are on a time limit because we have somewhere to be that is why we made a reservation) The 6 of us were seated in a cramped booth that was meant for 4 people. Luckily we got an amazing server that I thought would save our experience but then halfway into our dinner we had a group of 18 girls sat by us and the room got extremely loud. At that point I couldn't even hear my family members speaking to me. I'm extremely disappointed with this locations restaurant.

When I walked in I felt as though I had walked in to a restaurant in Italy. The decor was funny, like an Italian version of TGIF. But it only added to the whole experience. We wound up spending WAY too much for three people and getting WAY WAY too much food, too. But it was VERY much worth it. The food was awesome. And the quantity was huge. Although it seems a little ridiculous for them to charge $2 for a side of marinara sauce when we just got two $11 appetizers...but hey that's a fancy place for you. Had we ordered one dish and one appetizer I think we would have been perfect...but when your in Vegas you go big or go home.       This restaurant is perfect for any size party and for any occasion.

When we arrived, the host walking us to our table asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. We told him it was our anniversary.  we were then seated at a table in the middle of the room facing the kitchen.( I figured that with so early a reservation we might get a more discreet, less noisy table).  We sat for 10 minutes when we were approached by a busy but kindly  waitress who then asked (if you can believe it ) if we were celebrating a special occasion . Realizing there was obviously no communication between host and server, we told the occasion for the third time.  While the waitress was getting our drink another server  came to the table to get our drink and tell us the specials. We told her we were already being served . She then got annoyed and told us she would be right back, obviously to chew out the other server who started us.  She then came back and told us She would be our server. So we then gave her our drink order and she Id me and my middle aged husband.  Our caesar salad arrived, which we enjoyed (it was brought by another server) . Just before dinner arrived another server brought our drinks. Both of them wrong. I sent my  drink back, my husband kept the wrong one they gave him.  Our dinner was excellent ( the eggplant parm is done perfectly there).  After dinner the waitress asked if we wanted dessert as she was cleaning off our table. At this point we told her no.  Having told 3 people about our anniversary and then being ignored and given attitude by our server I was royally turned off.   Perhaps in the future we'll do take-out. I know Buca isn't a 5 star place, didn't expect it to be. But we'll save our special occasions for places that at least pretend to care.",

    "text": "The one thing about playing college basketball that I liked (other than the scholarship) was the delicious food you got to eat on road trips. This place is a prime example. Our entire team, plus coaching staff and trainers, ate here when we were in Vegas to play UNLV.       I should first say that I believe myself to be a bit of a connoisseur of Italian food, seeing that it was Italian food that we ate on almost every road trip; so when I say that this place was good, it means that it was better than some (but not all) of the best Italian spots in the Western U.S.                        The food was delicious, and I should know, I think we ordered everything on the menu after we robbed the Rebels with a buzzer-beater three pointer. I can't quite pin down my favorite dish, though I can say the the bread was amazing.       Considering 20-some odd people were eating together, I think that the service was excellent, and the decor kept me entertained when I wasn't staving off the forks and hands of my teammates who were vying for my plate of food.       Overall I would recommend this place for anyone who has the cash for a fun night on the town.      Go Gauchos!",

    "text": "Had a coupon for $10.00 off a purchase of $20 and thought we could go and have a nice dinner. The ambiance is always fun and gaudy there. Makes me giggle a bit. I honestly have not been to a Buca di Beppo for about 8 years so I was excited to go based on my memories of having family dinners there and loving the food. Well, I guess maybe I got spoiled with better Italian food along the way because today's meal wasn't really as good as I remember. Maybe, my palette has changed over the years?  We started with fried calamari (all my boyfriend's), and mozzarella garlic bread. He said the calamari was a little chewy, not as crisp as he prefers, but he finished it all. The garlic bread is always nice there, but the bread seemed to taste a bit stale at the bottom. They always sliver fresh garlic over the bread. We shared the small eggplant parmesan with a side of spaghetti and it was ok. There were two stacked pieces of eggplant parm, breaded nicely, with a good amount of cheese. The spaghetti noodles were great, they were cooked perfectly!  All in all, I guess I didn't like their marinara. It seemed too acidic to me, like they dropped some vinegar in there accidentally or something. My bf makes sunday gravy and I guess I'm spoiled by that flavor that my tastebuds changed. Buca is a nice place to get together with friends and family for family style food, but it does get expensive.",

Infact it was just down the street from the Hard Rock on Flamingo. I came here on a Sunday evening, and there was next to no one here at 6pm. It took a total of 2 minutes to get seated.   The menu is exactly like any other Buca's around in Socal. I ordered the Quatro Al Forno which comes with 4 different kinds of pasta and a meatball on the side. The total after tip had to be less the $20. This wouldn't buy me a single plate of food at the Wynn. The management there was very friendly. I remember them asking me how the place compared to the ones in Socal. I lied and told them its superb, when really it was on the same level. Its a franchise, what else can you expect but some good proportioned Italian cooking at the Buca?",

    "text": "Well I have now tried Buca twice.  The first time was a few weeks ago at the summerlin buca. It was about 830 pm and my soup was not hot, the chicken breast prosciutto tasted store bought and frozen (and had a bone in it!!) and the lasagna was mediocre. Our server was great but the food service was very slow. I discussed this experience with Buca and they asked me to try again. To give them another chance because that is NOT their normal service or food preparation. So I did last night. We went as a small group before playing mini golf. Tried some different dishes and this time went to the paradise location. Our server seemed new. Or busy. It was 9 pm when we sat down and it took a long time to even get drinks (someone else brought our wine and beer) and bread. Then our applies came. The ceasar salad was ok. The stuffed mushrooms were tasty however getting like 7 mushrooms for like 14 dollars is ridiculous! A waste of money for sure. We continued to pour our own wine. We finally got our mains. The linguine with all the seafood was good apparently (the Guys shared that and I don't eat seafood). The chicken sausage ziti us ladies got. It was terrible! There was absolutely no flavor. No salt. No nothing. I ended up getting some marinara to try and \"give it some pizazz\" and still. Blah. So once again left there very unsatisfied. And thinking again \"what a waste of money\" because even after using the 20 dollar certificate the bill was still 100 dollars plus tip. Seriously like throwing money away. :-( so very sad when so many people tell me how good it is. Do I just have the worst luck?",

The waiter didn't once ask how our meal was or if we needed anything. I will also add that it wasn't all that busy in here as it Easter Sunday. Our friends ordered baked rigatoni and the pasta was undercooked. I wouldn't recommend this place. I was a waitress and I think I give people a fair chance when I go out to eat.

    "text": "We thought we had a reservation......we were 25 people.......we all showed up for dinner but.......Buca wasn't ready or able to seat us for a half hour. when they finally tried to seat us there wasn't enough seats, it took another 15 minutes to get my family seated at 3 different tables for a \"family style\" dinner. The Buca di Peppo family must be a dysfunctional family! We were at this restaurant for over an hour before we were even able to place our drink orders (3 tables worth) and because we were seated by the bar instead of one of there group rooms we had to deal with the other large group(s) that were waiting for their group room to become available. I was waiting for a manager to come and offer an apology but this never happened. There was one server for our 3 tables and he had the help from a couple bus persons but it was obvious that they were also taking care of other customers. Our 3 tables were served dinner at different times. They were slow to seat us, they were slow to take our drink orders, they were slow to bring us our appetizers, they were very slow to come back after they served the appetizers to take our dinner orders and then they served us a different times. This is NOT how my family does family style. Buca at 412 E. Flamingo in Las Vegas if I thought you gave a damn about your customers coming back I would call the manager and give him/her a piece of my mind. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in Las Vegas and lived there for almost 30 years. Congrats Buca! ....oh I never talked about the food. Well if you still want to know about the food after knowing how bad their service is, here it goes.....   We ordered the Cheesy Florentine Toast that wasn't bad, the appetizer trio (calamari, fried mozzarella & stuffed mushrooms) was pretty good. For entrees we ordered Spicy Chicken Rigatoni which I liked, we also ordered the Chicken Limone...very good and we had the spaghetti and meatballs, not enough sauce and the meatballs should have been called meat loafs, they were tasty but nothing like any meatballs I've ever had. One our tables ordered the eggplant parm and it was pretty good from a guy who confesses to not like eggplant very much.   Bottom line....if you have a big group and are looking for a place to have a family style meal out in Las Vegas......KEEP LOOKING!",

Wednesday night took family here it was an 85th B-day and had a sad experience. The service did not start out right even though we had reservations we had to wait for our table in an empty restaurant. The service was slow in getting things out to our table, drinks, bread came there was very little had to ask for plates and oil/ vinegar, appetizer was dry no balsamic or oil for the caprese and it was removed before we finished it, wasn't asked if we wanted it to go. We had to remind our server about salad that did not show up with the appetizer. Our entrees, ravioli some cold in the middle, baked Ziti and Fettucini was bland and soggy. The chicken Parmesan (no cheese) was ok. More bread was requested a large order came out after our entrees were served. The server was not very attentive, maybe she was spread to thin with other tableIs. It was not a very good experience and did not want to make issues while the elders were there, but the elders did speak up sharing there disappointment on the way home which lead me to this review. Also called, no mgr was available, but Chef Doug took the call shared the experience with him, and would have the GM contact me. No calls were returned. I don't think this establishment cares.

I used to eat buca regularly, so I have very high expectations for their food. When my food arrived, My eggplant parmesan tasted like charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!!! Disappointment reigned as I tried to chew down my burnt, tough, eggplant. My friend ordered the speghetti and meatball, and the meatball was pink/red inside!!! My other friend ordered the chicken limone, which was supposed to come with fettuccini alfredo noodles. He a small piece of boiled chicken, a lemon, and pasta with no sauce. Hmmm.... we looked at his dish and analyzed it for a while, thinking this must have been a mistake.       So I called them, and they were very nice about. Although I do not agree with the justifications, I realize that accidents happen especially in the food industry. He said the meatball should be cooked because it sits in the sauce and has had at least 4 hours to cook. I dont know about that seeing as the meatball was pinkish red. Apparently he said that the chicken limone is supposed to be like that. In that case, it was  a HORRIBLE dish!!!! Boiled piece of dinky chicken with noodles and no sauce... for $10.00. They were nice enough to send us a coupon for free entrees to compensate, so I will try them once more, and retract my comment if they are good. Otherwise... stop being so cheap buca! keep your standards even though the economy sucks!",

    "text": "I am so happy to say that our visit tonight was amazing!!! Walking in to a group of of friendly hostesses was very nice and welcoming I was a bit surprised lol. We were seated immediately after arrival for our 6pm reservation. Our server Mike was very attentive and polite with great recommendations/tips for the menu. We ordered and quickly received our bread and salad. Shortly after our pasta arrived (spaghetti and meatballs) and let me tell you.... What A Meatball... we split 1!!! Too stuffed for dessert we decided to take it home (cannolis again mmmmm..). The meal was a total success, from the food to the wonderful service!!! So far it has topped all of my previous visits to the Buca restaurants in Las Vegas. Thank you again Mike for being a wonderful server and thank you to the manager Kenny (sorry I'm a bit hard of hearing). We appreciate you taking the time to come by and check on us, we appreciate you thank you!  We had a lovely time and look forward to returning soon.",

    "text": "We just do not get it. Buca is very popular for tourists and locals alike. And we just do not understand why. The restaurant is nicely decorated with a lot of nostalgia. It does have a great ambiance.  However, the service was poor and the food was below average. We attending a birthday celebration with reservations for 18. Our server, was not only trying to handle our party, but several other large parties in his section. I will confess, he did his best to be patient and efficient, but he was in way over his head.   We could not get drinks, bread, or dinner in a timely manner. Our reservation was for 6pm. We placed our orders at approximately 6:30 pm and it was not until 7:20 that we were served.   When the manager finally came out to help our server, it was because members of the other parties in our area were complaining. And then they tried to help everyone. Eh, maybe a bit too late to placate the patrons.  The food was warm and not the quality we expected. In retrospect, we would recommend Bravo Italian Restaurant in the Galleria Mall.  Or their sister restaurant, Brio, at Town Center. Their method of service is much more efficient in that all of the employees work together to make sure your meal is served quickly and hot. And their dinners are not served family style, so you can get what you like, individually as opposed to in mass. The food was over priced, but the portions we large!   While we typically like to leave positive reviews, we just could not find a few good reasons to give one to Buca!",

What surprised us most was the crowd waiting outside.  I doubt we'll ever try this chain again.",

I always have to come home early/ right after the meal because I'd get a stomach ache.  The portions are huge and meant to be shared but they now have individual lunch portions. I came here with a group as always so we got the large portions of the stuffed mushrooms, calamari, shrimp fra diavolo, eggplant Parmesan, prosciutto stuffed chicken, spaghetti and meatballs and an everything pizza. For dessert we had a tiramisu and strawberry cake.  I'm not going to individually rate each food and go into detail as nothing really stands out. Nothing special. The food is inconsistent. We came here a few months ago and pretty much got the same items on the menu - sometimes the food is dry, sometimes drowning in sauce. The tiramisu could sometimes taste like nothing but alcohol and we're drunk on our working lunch - not good.  I prefer not to write reviews for chain restaurants but I feel strongly about this one because it's very inconsistent and I'm not a fan.",

    "text": "I have been to various locations before and really enjoy the food. However, I decided to go to the flamingo location tonight for my birthday dinner with the family and my experience was total trash. First we walked in with a reservation and our table wasn't even ready. We only waited about 6 minutes so it wasn't a big deal. We get seated and it is going good until I realize we have been seated for a little over 10 minutes with no greeting or anything. Finally someone comes over and says, \"Has your server been to your table yet.?\" Then our server comes over and while we are waiting for a couple people to arrive we try to order drinks and an appetizer. Our drinks didn't come to the table for about 10 more minutes and they came one at a time. Finally our whole party is complete and we are all kind of just hanging out.... have yet to see our server come around again. When she does she stands at one end of the table and takes the whole tables order from one person which is fine. But instead of letting us know we probably ordered too much food for our party size, considering the portions are huge, she acted like it was going to be just enough food for us. We wait about an hour and 10 minutes in total before our food finally comes out and we are super disappointed at this point. They didn't even pre bus our table to make room for our dinner plates. So while they were putting them down we were literally handing them empty appetizer plates and dirty napkins and silverware. We never received more napkins or silverware either. The side of mashed potatoes was literally cold, like the butter didn't even melt on them, and they tasted like they were scraped out of a TV dinner. Our side of garlic mozzarella bread is nowhere to be seen. Chicken is a little dry and way too buttery not quite enough lemon. We all have empty drink glasses majority of our time and until I track down our server and let her know there are multiple issues with the table she didn't even check back. I let her know and she takes the mashed potatoes, brings back the same exact dish of them and says they are hot now. I didn't come out to eat to have microwaved mashed potatoes. Still haven't received water or soda refills. And at the end of our dinner the small amount of staff they still have on comes to sing to me for my birthday. At the end of the song I blow out the candle and the server asks if I want the birthday cheesecake, kind of implying that it is maybe a free dessert. I say no and someone at my table says yes. It ended up being on our check. A $12.99 piece of \"birthday cheesecake\" that I said no to when she asked. Odd. Anyways. We are looking at the check and we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs but after we ordered it she comes back and says they are out of the \"homemade\" meatballs. And they can do the meat sauce instead. For some reason we are still charged for the meat balls which is only a 5 dollar difference but still. I bring it to her attention and she has to adjust the bill. In the end I will say I am NEVER going back to this location again. Clearly they need new management and more staff because they had no idea how to run a restaurant in there. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.",

The veal was tougher than chicken fried steak might have been. It was over fried and dark crusty. The meatballs were overcooked and had darkened crust. The bread that was brought out to us was cold, maybe it was supposed to be that way.",

My top go-to's are the Apple Gorgonzola Salad  and the Shrimp Fradiavolo, you can't go wrong with either. I recommend going in larger groups, as this is a family style restaurant, the portions are enourmous and reasonably priced.",

Once the bartender made eye contact with us we realized he was actually also our server. He was very nice and friendly but the level of service here is awful. Once he took our order he offered us house bread and said he would be right back. Our entrees came out first(and were cold). Then our appetizer. Followed by our \"server\" smelling like smoke. Maybe if he hadn't been on a smoke break we would have gotten our food correctly. Then after we were almost finished with our food he brought us a cold bread basket....  Thanks but no thanks. Waste of money. With all the places to eat at in vegas this is definitely last on the list.",

There are enough good restaurants in Las Vegas that care about their business that I don't need to eat at this kitschy tacky mess with poor service.

So we were really surprised by our experience at this location.  We had a relatively large party (13 people) but were seated quickly and they worked with us to arrange seating so that we were all together. Our server was pleasant. While not rude, she was not very helpful and did not display the upbeat demeanor that we had every other time we have eaten at a Buca's. Had this been the only shortcoming, we would have overlooked it. Unfortunately, when the food came we were in for more disappointments and let-downs.  The salads (chopped, Caesar, and Apple-Gorgonzola) were good ( a bit less flavorful than we have had in the past, but good).  With the exception of the Chicken Parm, the entrees were bland, under-cooked, and for several of the dishes, cold. Even with the wine and Sangria, these dishes were hard to eat and not at all enjoyable.  So sadly, we will neither return no e recommend this location.",

Place is very nice and clean but the bathrooms are in the casino o itself so you have to walk away from the restaurant cause they don't have any inside . So for our order. I got chicken parm with spaghetti and marinara and my wife got chicken parmesan with fettuccine Alfredo and we ordered an order of garlic bread. Now save your money with the garlic. Read cause for a small order it's $13 and they were pure trash. Hard and no taste of garlic whatsoever, I asked the waiter if they are made fresh and he said yes but I believe they sat since yesterday! Both meals sucked! The pasta came out barely warm but the chicken was hot so they let the pasta sit on a plate in the open while the chicken. Was being cooked! Small portions for the price you pay which is $16 for each plate. Ooo and the chicken was soggy soggy soggy! Our waiter who I will leave his name out to be nice came to take our order, bring us our plates but no extra napkins till after we were done. And then brought us out a damn check without even asking if we want yes dessert which we did so basically trying to rush us out when the restaurant is not even half packed at 12pm. Ordered a cheesecake and that's not even worth the $14. OLIVE GARDEN IS 20xs better and I'm not even exaggerating. It was just plain food that you could get at a buffet for a better the price of 1 freaking meal. Last time I come to this chain!",

    "text": "For a chain restaurant, the inconsistency in the food and service is appalling. Buca makes you sign a contract for a large party prior to making a reservation, which is fine, but they failed to uphold their own terms of the contract. We were due to be seated at 7:30 pm, but they were not prepared for our party and we had to wait an hour. The bread and salads were okay, nothing special. They only gave 4 butters for 3 loaves per basket. The food, fettuccine Alfredo, a sausage ziti and chicken limon. The fettuccine was over peppered, cold noodles and the sauce made me feel like I was licking a chalkboard. The sausage ziti wasn't too bad, not nearly as good as other Buca's I have been to. The chicken was cold and had to be returned because it was not safe to serve. We had 2 members of the party with celiac, and had notified, in the contract that we would need gluten free food for them. The service staff, and who I assume was the manager forgot, and then became combative and defensive when we pointed out that they had not received their meals 20 minutes after our entrees were served. There are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas, please don't waste a dime here. Please also note that the servers Jenny and PJ were awesome, attentive, and handled the situations well. The rest of the staff in fact, did not.",

I think the one thing holding this place back is the service. I've never come here and felt my service was good. It's always been just mehhh. We waited forever for our drinks because our server said she keeps running over to bar and they're not ready yet. They should consider a bar runner, for such a large, yet busy restaurant.

My cousin was being deployed the next morning for 7 months, and Buca Di Beppo on Tropicana was his favorite place, so of course that's were we went. Lorenzo, the manager, greeted us and was extremely friendly. Nick our waiter was great at first. He explained the menu and everything was wonderful. We ordered  several drinks, appetizers and entrees (well over $200). The food was awesome! We hung out, ate and visited. Meanwhile he brought us our bill, before we were asked if we wanted more  drinks or dessert. Because we were so busy visiting I didn't notice that one member of the party gave their credit card for the bill. Up to this point it was a great experience, then to my surprise a hostess came to our table and informed us they had a reservation party coming in and they needed our table. Completely caught off guard we didn't respond. Looking around there was over half of the restaurant seating available. We were interested in more drinks and dessert but because of this rude lady we got up anyway and continued visiting outside. No one came in after we left. I returned inside to use the restroom before getting on the road and the table was still dirty 25 mins later. My local family that spoke highly of this place is completely disappointed in this \"family\" style restaurant that cut our family time short!!!",

However, despite all the warnings, I still wanted to give this place at least one try.   If you aren't familiar with Buca di Beppo, the main concept is that it offers \"family style meals\". This means that when you select something from the menu, the portion is enough for two or more people, from appetizers to salads to pastas. The Food is great and I had enough for left overs!

It included large penne pasta with a spicy sauce, fresh tomatoes and peas. The sauce was very creamy and had the perfect amount of spice. I felt like there was a good amount of fresh, moist chicken spread throughout the dish.  Every interaction with the staff was pleasant. Both the host and the manager very helpful and kind. When I put in the order, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I went to the restaurant, the manager automatically knew my order and the host went to get it right away. I was in and out within about 5 minutes. I will definitely be back!",

We ordered large plates of everything as it was a large group & the sizes were very generous!  Calamari was fresh with a very zesty red sauce and everyone loved it. The pear salad was excellent. Anti-pasto salad was also a very big portion and it was really tasty. We also ordered Caprice salad for an appetizer... it was delicious mozzarella was very fresh  & really well seasoned.   We all loved the Spaghetti and the meatballs are huge. Supreme fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was delicious. Veal Parmesan  was crispy, tasty, and we ran out before it went around the table. Shrimp Diavolo was great and the Quattro Alforno platter was really enormous... deserts were the same story.  Large portions & delish;)   I read some of the negative reviews before returning to this restaurant and I don't understand what they are talking about.   Josh who took our original phone inquiry was so helpful. He referred us to Jordyn in banquets sales, she was also very helpful & suggested we order off the menu to save money.   Gretchen Heppler booked our reservation... She was great and even texted me information. It turns out she is their Regional Director of Sales.    Our server Sayed from was excellent, he was getting the food out quickly, refilling drinks and so kind.   We all want to go back... great restaurant which deserves to be well rated according to all 18 people who we hosted.   The bill including drinks was extremely reasonable for what we received. Could not ask for any better food or service.  Great Family style restaurant!!!",

Kept the mood very high dipite the issues we had with the food.  The first issue we had was with the salad, we asked for no olive in the salad, and the olive was not removed, and there was also the base part of the lettuce in the salad. That part you don't eat.  The second issue was with the Brussels sprouts. They were VERY hard and undercooked.  The staff did their best to help solve the issues with their food. The staff was amazing, attentive, and very friendly. Silly Billy is by far one of the best waiters ive ever had. I'd gladly go back to see him and eat more of the cheese cake.  The problems seem to be coming from the kitchen.",

It took our server 45 minutes to bring out our appetizer, garlic bread, and she disappeared after so we didn't get to order our entree's for an hour. It took her that long to get my moms water which she asked for the second we were greeted. After another hour our food still wasn't served and the restaurant was closed. When we complained to the manager he was completely rude and said he would \"make a deal with us because he didn't want the food to go to waste.\" We ordered a couple pasta dishes. When we got our food it was absolutely disgusting and not hot. We had to call the manager over again to complain and by this time he said he hoped that he was doing \"enough\" for us. Our server was passive-aggressive when we patiently asked for things as simple as napkins and a refill too. Absolute WORST Buca in town, horrible service and horrible food. If you're looking for a wonderful dinner do not expect to get one here, try the Buca on Lake Mead.",

So, forget the decor.  How's the food?   Well, the portions are quite large, and the flavor is equally common.  From the first bite, you will know you are at a low level chain restaurant that doesn't have a real chef on staff.  Do you want a real Italian culinary experience?  Go to Il Fornaio or the likes. This is the Pizza Hut version of Italian dining.  Eat too much, leave stuffed and yet less than satisfied.    Then, dessert.... enjoy your diabetic coma if you get the Colossal Chocolate Brownie Sundae.  It is as big as a football.  Don't order unless there is at least 5 people to eat it.  Seriously huge.    As for this local restaurant, it was very understaffed at lunchtime, nevertheless, when they finally got around to serving us, they were very friendly.  It is the ownership's fault it is not properly staffed, not the employees' fault.    In a nutshell, there are much better choices for Italian dining.  Choose one.",

The tomato \"sauce\" was really just crushed tomatoes and not saucy. Gelato was decent. Overall, the food disappointed big time.   Our group of 14 had the distinct pleasure of sitting in the creepy Pope Room. There is a bust of a Pope in the middle of the round table. Weird. And tons of Pope-related pictures on the walls. The room itself is too small for people to get in and out easily. No music, too bright, too stuffy. Stay away from this room, even for a large party. And the giant lazy Susan just makes things awkward when people on opposite sides try to move it in opposite directions.   Service is slow. We had one server for our whole table. Nice guy and did okay for having such a big table.   Drinks at the bar were overpriced. 12.99 for one shot of crown royal. On the strip I would understand, but not for a mediocre chain restaurant off the strip. And the bar tenders appeared to be arguing with each other while at the bar.   Girlfriend said bathroom could use some attention.   Not coming back. You've been warned people. Don't expect much.",

My best advice is to go during their lunch hour. The food is better priced and it is just as good! Dinner pricing is a bit overwhelming and I understand that it is served in big portions for a family but honestly our dinner price came down to about $32 per person and we felt that was a little much for what it was. Other than pricing being a bit heavy on the wallet everything else was great!",

    "text": "I have been to numerous Buca di Beppo restaurants in various states and have LOVED everyone of them. I bragged it up and was so excited to have my significant other and grand-daughter try it. Nick was our server and we told him we were starving. He first asked us if we wanted to order some garlic bread to go with our meal? We said no. We later realized that bread and butter do still come with dinners here. I am familiar with up-selling since years ago, I worked at Red Robin, but I thought this was kind of sneaky. He also said the small spaghetti which was $30.00 would be plenty for us. Well, it wasn't. I do remember the past proportions were large, this place seemed to be significantly smaller then the others. The worst part about it, was that there was mostly a huge amount of tomato sauce versus the noodles. When Nick checked on us, he could see about two cups of sauce sitting at the bottom and we asked if we could just get some more noodles since that small bowl was not enough for us, unless of course we wanted to drink the sauce. He said he would check and came back telling us that he could give us a kids size spaghetti. We agreed to that. Our original order was for spaghetti with meat sauce. This time without him even asking he brought spaghetti with meatballs. Then our bill came. He charged us for the kids spaghetti and meatballs which were $6.49. Total balance was $35.98 for two adults and a six year old. We left hungry, uncomfortable due to the lumpy seats and overall very disappointed. I would NEVER go back to this location.",

The server told us the food would take 15-20 minutes. She didn't check on us once and was busy with larger parties (we were a party of only 2). After an HOUR she walked by and said you still don't have your food. She brought out the food --- and the chicken was cold. The ziti looked like it'd been sitting there a good minute. When she finally checked on us we were finished eating. She took the price off for the chicken. I feel she was overwhelmed with all the big parties - but that still made us feel unwelcome and insignificant. I tipped her 20% because I too am a server; but I must say, it was not a good experience for us tonight.",

I think the server, Evan, was just super lax; he took his sweet time before greeting us and getting drinks. But he was nice and checked up on us often during the meal and boxed everything up at the end.  We had to ask for the lunch menu cause serving sizes even for a small size off the regular menu would be way too much for two people to eat. Those entrees didn't even come with a side and that would be separate. But anyways, it didn't make sense why they wouldn't provide that at the beginning either.  I dined at the location at Ballys a month prior to this visit for a catering event and that was what made me want to return here. I had the chicken limone and was craving it thus that was what I ordered, with a side of spaghetti marinara. BF got the spicy chicken rigatoni.   When the food arrived my lunch combo seemed like it was switched; it was as if I ordered a spaghetti marinara with a side of chicken limone lmao. The chicken itself looked like half a chicken breast! Nonetheless, it was good but the one I had at Bally's was better. The rigatoni had peas which I don't like but bf said it was also okay, quite heavy though.  I'd say come with a lot of people. I don't think a party of three or less will enjoy this place much even for the lunch menu portion.",

Their staff always setup the food in a very nice manner. All utensils, napkins, plates, etc are included in the pricing. And many people really rave about their baked zits which is always a staple in my catering orders. I will continue to utilize their catering services. Give these guys a shot if ur having a private event or need catering for your next work function. Quality food and service at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in this experience.  This is my 2nd experience at this location, first time was last year at my cousin's graduation - food tasted fresh, hot and the service was impeccable.  This trip?? Horrible.  Our cousins were visiting from New York and a few of us from San Diego drove over to meet them; there was a total of 14 in our party.  The waiter (Kevin I think) seemed friendly when a few of us first arrived but then quickly got overwhelmed.  We ordered the di Beppo salad, Cesar salad, green beans, baked ziti, eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, chicken marsala and calamari.  The salads were great, good flavor, cold and crisp.  Calamari was excellent, comes in a huge martini glass (tentacles and everything)!! The breading is light, not greasy and you can actually taste the calamari which is extremely tender.  The baked ziti was extremely dry, very little sauce.  Both marsala dishes came covered in a thick sauce which seemed more like a glaze rather than an actual marsala sauce; the meats were tender though.  All of the food (minus the salads) came out luke warm.  The green beans were the biggest disappointment; one of my aunts is a vegetarian, and this is one of her favorites.  We placed two orders to start, but both lacked flavor and seemed like the beans were previously frozen.  She sent one of the plates back and was brought a \"fresh, hot batch.\"  However this one was worse than the first two - no flavor, chewy and tasted like they had been quickly defrosted.   This is usually such a fun restaurant to come too and have family style meals; I've been to multiple locations but this one is the worst one by far.  I know restaurants have off nights but this was extremely disappointing.",

I mentioned this to the waiter and after letting him know what tables should get a bill he went up to each table and loudly told them they were paying and he thought they should know. The way he did it was extremely rude and all the other guest heard him telling them and they felt bad just not the way to handle it.  The food was great, but the waiter was rude I only got 2 servers for such large party. I also had a cake and he forgot to bring it out. We spent a lot of money with them that day and I had guest who wanted more bread and drinks and they got them after we were done.   People look for another place I read the reviews and did not pay attention I thought this cant happen to me! WEL IT DID.  I will say that Erick was a great server but the other one sucked and he was not dressed proper, pants sagging and just looked bad.   Will not come here again EVER.",

You end up inhaling a whiff of smoke as you walk in, and even the lobby smells like smoke. 2. The food took forever to come out. 3. The food was bad. We ordered the chicken rigatoni and a veggie pizza. I asked for the rigatoni to be cooked al dente but it was overcooked and bland. The pizza barely had any veggies on it and there was way too much cheese. The edges just looked like a cheese pizza. Our waitress was very nice and I'm sure it's not her fault that they were under staffed and the chef can't cook. We won't be coming back to this location.",

It was really packed so we thought well people don't wait in line for bad food, or do they? We started with the apple gorgonzola salad b/c it was listed on the calorie count (very minimum info available for that so if its avail it must be ont he lower end of the scale that they are willing to divulge).  As for the entree they serve in these huge family style portions. The small serves 1-3 people and the large. who knows.. The Cardinals offensive line maybe? Well we ordered the quattro soemthing or another. It consisted of stuffed shells, mannicotti, chicken cannteloni and ravioli. The sauce was very minimal and tons of cheese. I left feeling guilty for thinking I'd just consumed an entire wheel of cheese- My bf was very disapointed in the ravioli - he thought it would be the best since it was the center of the dish. Wrong. It ranked dead last. We both agreed that the stuffed shells came in 1st place. If I went back to buca I'd def. go with the stuffed shells. To be honest though.. Las Vegas has so many other great restaurants the next place on my list is the sicilian place on E. Trop. so we'll see. Stay tuned.",

We started with fried mozzarella, garlic bread and Caesar salad (small size in everything). The mozzarella was ok and so was the Caesar. We also ordered the lasagna, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and baked ziti.  All of the food was overly garlicky. As my husband mentioned, we could have killed a vampire if we burped... The bread sucked and was overly toasted, the fettuccine was so dry that we had to request 2 additional bowls of sauce which we got charged for, the ziti was dry but, by that time, we didn't even care anymore. The only thing that was semi tasty was the lasagna. At least it wasn't dry... Total came to over $150 for everything. And, they charge for everything...like $10 for the chicken in the fettuccini ... Pick another place for Italian.  Actually pick another place for dinner...period. Will not return.  Thanks for the service Jenny. You're probably better off going back to working at chili's...sorry :-/",

Most of the items I have tried I feel any average person could make at home and the quality would be the same.    The sauce doesn't have a lot of flavor depth but not bad in taste either.  It is a great place for a large group as the atmosphere is fun and inviting.  It is also family style so you can try a number of different items at a time.  The wait staff has always been great when I have gone.  They check in with you pretty regularly.    They do have a pretty cool/creepy pope head table that is set on a Lazy Susan so it spins.  You can always have fun turning it to awkwardly stare at other members of your party through out the night.  Overall I just do not have a lot to say as there was not any thing particular  good or bad that stuck out to me.  It is just very middle of the rode.",

I ordered a small chicken carbonara to go and it was enough to bring to a potluck. The pasta was not dry and it was very flavorful. The bits of bacon gave it more taste.  What concerned me the most is their customer service. There was NO customer service in this restaurant at all. The host was busy talking with who seems to be the manager and they didn't even acknowledge my presence when I was right in front of them. I also received no help when I was at the take out counter. I was standing there unattended for a good 5-10 minutes before someone even asked me if I was being helped, even though so many servers came and passed by me (they were even making eye contact with me).  Their online ordering system also needs more improvement. I ordered online and received my confirmation email, so I thought it was all good. When someone finally helped me, they told me that they cancelled my order because my payment didn't go through. All this time I was unaware that they cancelled it without notification so I had to wait at the restaurant even more so they could prepare my order. The person I was talking to seemed to blame me because of my cancelled payment (even though I used the same card I put in online) and was not apologetic for the inconvenience.  Overall it was such a disappointing visit. I wouldn't mind eating at Buca di Beppo but I will definitely go to another location.",

    "text": "We came to this restaurant as a couple and wanted to have a lovely dinner. As soon as we arrived they sat us inside near the bar area. It took 10 minutes to get the food menu and the drink menu. Within five minutes they took our drink order. Mind you it took another ten minutes to get our simple margarita and iced tea. The server wasn't only serving us but also serving 3 people at the bar.  We were ready to order and kept eyeing the several servers passing through but none offered to help or to see if we were ready. After another ten minutes of waiting they finally took our food order and brought us bread. No silver ware no napkins, nor any offers of oil or vinegar. After 10 minutes the server was going to the back and we had to call her over just to help out to get our silver ware. Mind you the food was wonderful, but the service was awful. Only come here if you have all the patience in the world. As for us we arrived about 30 minutes late to our show.",

They remembered to take care of my gluten free guest and they made sure all of our other guests were treated like royalty.  The food was amazing!  We had the chicken limone, cannelloni and another pasta dish that was SO GOOD!  The manager came by to make sure we were happy and of course we were.  After speaking to our guests they said their food was as good as we thought ours was!  These days I prefer to eat at home because I hate paying good money for food that I can make even better at home.  This is one of the places I would put on my short list as a go to for a great meal!",

    "text": "I don't really like giving chains 5-stars but I think Buca deserves it for several reasons.  First off the servings are huge, which allows you to order a few things for the table and have your party pick a large variety of tastes.    Second- the price point is not bad for the amount of food you get with entrees ranging in the $15-$30 range (depending on serving size).  if you sign up for their e-mail club or coupon clip you'll see a $10 off purchase of $20 or more.  Get a small pasta and two drinks and you've got yourself a very reasonable date!  Lastly the food is very good.  Maybe they don't have the bread sticks or salad like Olive Garden, but the dishes themselves are very good.  As you'll see with my other reviews of Italian places, I use Buca as my \"base-line\" to compare other maybe fancier places.",

    "text": "I had dined here the last time I visited, but this visit was for my wedding dinner reception. What an outstanding job they did. We only had one waitress wait on a table of 12. She did a fantastic job.   Our original reservation was for 7:30, but the ceremony was over earlier than I anticipated. I called and was able to get it changed to 6:30. We were about 15 minutes late, but were seated immediately when we got there.  As soon as we were seated, the drinks and the food just kept on coming out. We had a set menu done ahead of time and were served immediately. I love that the food is family style. We had so much food and it was all so good. We were bummed that we couldn't take it with us. But none of our hotel rooms had microwaves.  The manager was great and so were all the staff. I love this place for family occasions. I will gladly be back on my next visit.",

    "text": "I went in today after visiting the restaurant yesterday for dinner.  This evening I stopped to get the Fett. Alfredo to go with the coupon I had from signing up with the e-club program.  We decided to sit and eat a dessert while the dish was prepared to go.  The dish arrived as if we were going to eat it right then,  I told the hostess who took the order and brought the dish that it was to go.  I even told her before we took a seat at the bar that it was to go and we will eat a dessert here.  No problem on that.  But not listening is an issue.    Next problem was the dessert.  The bar tender took the order which was also pointed to him on the menu that we want the Italian creme cake.  However we got a Celebration Wedge Cake.  An ugly and most awful tasting cake I have eaten.  Generally I do not order cakes in the US because they are certainly not like European cakes to begin with.  We ate a bit and took the rest (not sure why to be honest) but I was so pissed.  I even told the bartender it was the worst dessert I had ever eaten as he asked me how was the dessert.  He did not say much and took my payment - $9.45 for one awful colorful red/yellow/green (Italian flag) cake that had the entire bottle of food color thrown in of red and green.  I never eat food color however this was one sick tasting cake.  The cream or whatever it was (not cream by New Zealand standards) was so sweet and fake tasting - I am madder than mad if that is even possible. One for not getting what I ordered and then eating some crap that is presented as a dessert that I never ordered.  I did ask the bartender about it but he said nothing. Overpriced for what I got. Cheap looking dessert .  And they called it a Celebration Wedge Cake - not sure what there is to celebrate.  This place is nothing but drama - not sure what I patronized it 3 times in one month; need to have my head examined.  I will only be deceived once!",

When you walk in, you almost feel like you're at an Italian home. The typical checkered table, Christmas lights, vases.. very Italian atmosphere.  Everything served up family style, which I liked. We ordered stuffed chicken, stuffed pasta shells and Caesar salad. Everything was good. Not completely authentic, but decent Italian food. It's a bit pricey, but definitely a place that I would check out once a year or so.",

    "text": "This is a very sad moment for me, because this is the first one star I have given to any restaurant. However, as sad as it is, it can not be avoided. My boyfriend and I have been coming to this Buca di Beppo for a while now, and every time we come the service gets progressively worse. Yesterday, he decided to take me out as a surprise dinner date.   Upon arriving, we were seated the the waitress came to our table to take our order. We ordered our drinks and ordered the pasta that we love so much, the Penne Arrabiata. After we ordered the waitress gave us an attitude and look as if saying, \"is that really all you're going to order?\" We just smiled at her politely, and eventually she went to put our order in. Although it did seem kind of rude, we just brushed it off because they were pretty busy that day.  One of the things we love most about Buca is the bread. After placing our order, we waited patiently for our bread. Sadly, it never came. We saw that same waitress bring bread and attend to everyone else's table but out own. The only time she came by our table was to bring out our actual meal. The penne arrabiata was good as always, but sadly not even that can make me give this place any higher of a rating.   Besides the lack of bread, our cups of water needed to be refilled and not once did she come by to check on us. I even made eye contact with her a few times and tried to get her attention, but she never stopped by our table to check on anything. My boyfriend, who was at the edge of the booth even drank all of his water and placed it at the edge of the table to see if anyone would notice, but no one did.   Sadly, the dinner at Buca was definitely one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I will just have to find a new one to go to.",

    "text": "The eggplant parm is excellent, it has to be the best entree on the menu. The flavors were perfect and the eggplant was crisp. They brang out one of our entrees wrong but the server noticed right away and corrected it. The marinara is pretty bland and could use more seasoning. I like my pasta al dente and this spagetti was not, it kind of reminded me of spagetti from the mall food court. I wish they seasoned the food better and it wasn't so bland. The family style servings seem like a good idea economically until you get the bill and see you could have paid half elsewhere ordering your own entrees. Personally I think it is too pricey for what you get and the quality. The seats and tables are crammed, hard and uncomfortable. I remember this place being a lot better. I don't think I will come here again.",
