Service was great, Mac and cheese waffle was great, but entrees were just okay. I got a seafood soup and it was alright. I'd go back just for the Mac and cheese.   Probably my least favorites restaurant of theirs. Honey salt, then made lv, then here.  Will give another chance.",

    "text": "Andiron... Named after the stand in a wood burning fireplace. An unusual name for a restaurant of this class but nothing is lost as the dinning experience was nothing short of impeccable. Quickly seated at our 6:30 reservation our wonderful experience started with some elegant French water with a twist of lime. An appetizer of 'Foie Gras' soon followed which was delightful. Our main courses consisted of the 9oz rib eye filet with asparagus and 10oz grass fed filet and twice baked potato, a meat and potatoes man's dream. A lovely fruity cabriolet complemented the dishes perfectly. I'd loved to say we stayed for desert but the meal was quite adequately filling so no room was left to sample some of the tempting sweets. Overall an exceptional dinning experience in a beautiful setting.",

The atmosphere is fun and light and when we went for dinner they had a fantastic singer and brunch had an amazing DJ!! Both kept the mood fun and entertaining!! First I will say the avocado toast is everything!! I have tried to recreate it but no such luck. The Bloody Mary bar is literally the entire bar! A brunches paradise. Their is a girl rolling through with a cart for mimosas & Bellini! Amazing. The wait staff is incredibly accommodating! Dinner is perfection! As a vegetarian it's always an adventure finding delicious entrees at restaurants that don't necessarily cater to veg eaters 7 days a week. The cauliflower steak was perfection! So big I could not even finish!  I love how you see the managers all over the place stopping at each table, shaking hands, checking on guests.  Andiron definitely is on my goto lists any day of the week!!",

The first dish up was the bacon wrapped matzo balls. Amazing!!! Sacri-licious. The matzo was perfectly cooked. Moist, soft, delicious. Served with arugula and a horseradish creme fraiche.   The crab cake was also excellent. Soft consistency with juicy fresh crab and lots of it. No filler. Served with a cilantro sauce and a chili oil and frisee and cilantro on top. Light and fresh.    Next was the 16 oz. NY strip. Not bad. I've had better though. The chimichurri was so so.   Finally we had the Mac and cheese waffle. Yup. A waffle made out of Mac and cheese. Tasty but unbelievably rich. I could only eat a quarter of it. The cheese caramelized a bit in the waffle iron giving it a chewy crunchy texture.   Finally - loved the flower theme. Hostess' dress, waiters' ties, inside the menus, wall paper, etc. Super fun.",

I, myself, partook in the fig and burrata salad and the Santa Barbara Seafood Pot, both of which were incredibly delicious. I suppose the only potentially negative thing were the prices, but if you're eating at a steakhouse in Downtown Summerlin, what were you expecting?  Long story short: If Andiron is in your price range, go there immediately!",

My mother and I shared the duck fat potatoes because we were intrigued and I had read a lot of reviews on them. I wasn't very impressed. They were more greasy and didn't have as much flavor as I had wished. Our filet mignon was good but we've had better.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed this restaurant! I met a friend last night and we decided to try something new. The decor is open, airy and sophisticated. The staff have a great energy and the service was excellent.   My food was very good, with a few misses. I ordered the \"Grilled and Chopped Salad\" which wasn't my favorite. The flavors were good, but the texture was off--everything was too mushy with the grilled vegetables, kale and romaine--all blended together. My friend had the caesar however, which was excellent. We both ordered steaks--I had the NY strip and he had the filet. The steaks were divine!! They were cooked perfectly and accompanied by Chimichurri sauce--which is a MUST try. We ordered the Mac and Cheese waffle which was creative and delicious (and very filling!). The creamed spinach was OK--tasted more like the flavor profile of green bean casserole...  DESSERT--You HAVE to try the donuts. They were absolutely amazing--crispy and fresh on the outside, with vanilla custard on the inside. Showstopper. My friend ordered the cheesecake--which it was good--beware! It is a more traditional style and VERY cheesy. The \"vanilla\" flavoring is very overpowered by cheese and the sour cream top. If you love the cheese in cheesecake, then go with it! If not, GET. THE. DONUTS.  The drink menu was creative. I had the Red Wine Sour--which was not very red-wine at all, but delicious. The \"wine by the glass\" menu is lengthy with some great wines on there at many different price points (about time in Vegas!).   Overall, great experience. Steaks, service and atmosphere will have me coming back!",

    "text": "This is my very first Yelp review !  Last night I went to Andiron Steak and Sea at Downtown Summerlin. My best friend was in town for the holidays and had seen their Mac and Cheese waffle featured on the Food Network so we decided to try this place out.  It is located at the very far end of the shopping center towards Red Rock Casino. The restaurant had a very warm ambiance with a combination of an exposed industrial ceiling and white wooden paneling reminiscent of a cape cod lighthouse. They had upbeat rock music playing in the background,  low enough that we could enjoy our conversation. It also had an open kitchen, not too noisy.   They started by brining us a few loafs of warm fresh baked bread. We decided to skip out on appetizers this trip. I ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with crispy parsnip, basil , brown butter-pistachio pesto. Even though it was a small portion , it was extremely tasty and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly. It had just a touch of sweetness , nothing overpowering.   My wife ordered Mary's Organic Chicken with  Confit leg, roasted carrots, brioche stuffing , black truffle jus. The chicken was very tender and the jus gave it such a flavorful taste I didn't want to stop eating it.   For sides we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with crispy kale , almonds and chili glaze & the Roasted Organic Mushrooms with shallot, thyme, croutons. The Brussel sprouts were delicious (not bitter like your mom used to make you eat growing up) and the roasted mushrooms were juicy and had a hint of earthiness.   We also ordered two of The Mac & Cheese Waffles, the entire reason we came to Andiron Steak and Sea in the first place. It was a medium size round crispy waffle served with a  bechamel sauce on the side with grated cheese sprinkled in the grooves. The best way to describe it is it tasted like a very flavorful mac and cheese with a baked bread crumb topping in each bite, not just baked on top like you would get at a typical steakhouse. In all honesty, it didn't blow me away but I thought it was very unique and tasty.  Our server Kenneth was very friendly , funny and patient. The bussers made sure our drinks were always full and immediately took away any dirty plates between courses. It was getting late so we passed on dessert. They had no issue splitting the bill multiple ways.   This is an upscale steakhouse and the prices were higher than I expected. 5 people with with a few sides, entrees and sodas came to over $200 dollars. I would definitely come back but probably for a special occasion.   On a side note: the other people in our party ordered the Scottish Salmon , a steak and a twice baked potato . I unfortunately didn't get to try them but they throughly enjoyed themselves.   \"Give me a slice of pizza , and I'll give you a smile.\"-A.G.",

When the wine was brought out, the manager Tony, saw our seating and immediately moved us to a more private table. Fantastic job on his part. We enjoyed a delicious dinner with wine and had a great time. The service was a little slow at times considering the number of people there, but that can be overlooked due to the quality of the food. Kudos to Tony for his attention and personal service. I recommend Andiron to anyone who wants a great dinner with fantastic ambiance.",

The front desk could've been a little more inviting. The service at table was very attentive. They catered to the adults as well as the children. They helped make sure the children got their meal first so they won't have to sit around.   We ordered the Tuna Poke, pork chops, grilled octopus, the Hanger steak, and the Branzino. The food was ok. The fresh food was really fresh. The cooked food seem to be focusing on having a char flavor. Some foods I like with the little bit of char however the foods this time seem to have a bit too much char on them. There is a kids menu for children. The kids menu fit well because it came with a full course meal including dessert and lemonade.   The ambiance was very nice inside. Seating was spacious and there's a full size bar.   This place gets 3 stars. I might not come back because the food was not for my palate but it may be for others.",

    "text": "We dined there for a Valentine's Day Dinner. When the reservation was made the previous week there was no mention of a preset menu. Day of my fiance looked up the menu and noticed their 4 Course preset menu on their website. We looked it over and it seemed pleasing so we kept our reservation. We purposely made our reservation after 8pm to avoid the rush and possibility of bad service as we work in the industry.    We where greeted immediately and sat right away. We purposely came early to have a drink at the bar before our reservation. The restaurant was about 65% full with many empty tables (8pm). Our server came over and was very nice and went over the wine list with us. We ended up ordering the Pineapple Cocktail.   The server took our order, mind you the menu items had no descriptions. The scallops where crudo. I was fine with that but my fiance had to choose from the other two underwhelming options.   The amuse came out. It was good but it was something you could order at Lobster Me in a hotel food court. The first course came out and the scallops where bland the shaved fennel was more like chopped pieces way too big. The scallops had no taste the should have been marinated longer. The French Onion soup was decent but super hot.   Our entrees came out immediately after the first course was cleared. They dropped the food and said something as they walked away. Remember the restaurant isn't that busy. Our busser came by and I had to ask for a fork and steak knives for our meal. For a place charging $79 per person they should be able to mark the table properly. We both ordered the same entree Wagyu NY steak and poached lobster tail. The lobster had to have  been a 3-4oz lobster tail. Once of the smallest I have ever seen. The steak was about 5 oz and was the toughest piece of meat I have ever had. I ordered it medium rare and it came out raw on the inside where the fat was pure white. It was also charred on the outside. The potato again was child sized. The term Wagyu is completely misleading. There is no way this would real Wagyu beef.   Then to find out they do offer other items that are not listed. However our server did not inform us of such choices. The people next to us where able to order a ribeye steak and Caesar salads. I would much have rather paid $79 for items desired.   To top it all off our drinks had been empty for about 20 minutes. We where never offer another drink. We would have ordered a bottle of wine as we where celebrating and purposely didn't drive.   The preset was in my opinion was a fail. For the quality and the price. I had never dined at Andiron before and most likely wont be back. I do however frequent at Honey Salt a sister concept of Andiron. I have never been disappointed there.   This all happened in 45 minutes from start to finish. We felt rushed throughout our dinner. We eat out about 3 times a week. I have  worked in the restaurant industry for 17 years and my fiance works in fine dining on the Strip. It should never only take 45 minutes for 4 courses. I strong recommend that the management rethinks what they offer in a preset menu and the pricing. Judging from the recent reviews I am not the only person disappointed with my Valentine's Day Dinner.   I struggled to give two stars or one. I know it is Valentine's Day and any industry person knows it can be tough. But if you are going to do a preset and only cook limited items make sure they are done well and priced correctly.",

Endless mimosas and bloody mary bar complete with bacon. Unlimited candy bar, what? Good thing I don't have a sweet tooth.  The last time I was there, my server gave me an insider tip. Order the BENEDICT with STEAK instead of shaved porchetta. O.M.G. to die for!  I also love it when there's a live DJ to set the mood with the right Sunday music.",

    "text": "Brought the boyfriend here for Valentine's Day dinner. First and foremost, I made reservations two weeks prior for 9PM and the hostess made confirmation calls the day of and was nice enough to let me change my reservation to 9:30 even though the restaurant closes at 10 (some places wouldn't make this exception, but the hostess was really kind and said that it was Valentine's Day so it was fine, I believe her name was Rocky).   We did the Valentine's Fixed Menu for $79 per person and wine pairing for $35 per person. We started with Kumiai oysters (1 for each us). It was served warm with some kind of topping over it that looked like a scrambled egg. I wasn't a big fan of it, but that's because I personally prefer my oysters cold and raw and nothing too crazy. This was served with a glass of bubbly.  For appetizers, my boyfriend ordered the pear and endive salad in bleu cheese. The alternate option was a tuna tartare, which they ran out of, and since I'm allergic to pears, they were able to substitute with a hamachi salad and that was super delicious. It was a pretty small serving, about 6 bite slices of fish to be exact, but every bite was really fresh. For this course of the meal, we had a white wine paired with it called Heaven's Horses aka \"3 H's\" according to our server. This complemented the course well.  For our main course, we both ordered surf and turf, which came with a small portion of potato au gratin. The lobster was good, can't really go wrong with lobster tail. The steak was okay. I like my steak cooked to medium, which it was, but the outside was over-cooked so it was a little chewy. We asked for steak sauce on the side to add a little more flavor to it. The potato au gratin was tasty; it had a hint of sweetness to it, but again, the portion was small. This course was paired with a cherry tart red wine, which also was a great complement.  For dessert, we ordered the German chocolate brownie and banana cream tres leches. The German chocolate was too sweet for my liking since it was also drizzled with chocolate syrup. As for the tres leches, it was perfectly made. It wasn't too soggy from the milk, also not too sweet, and the mascarpone made for a satisfying topping.   The atmosphere was romantic, perfect for the occasion, not too crowded or loud either.",

As if you didn't already know how obsessed I am (see other reviews).  The service is without a doubt attentive, quick, efficient and pleasant! We had a group of 6 and our glasses never went empty. They have several mixers for your champagne: cranberry, raspberry, orange and pineapple.   I can't even formulate my thoughts to describe how amazing our experience was at this place. The decor, the food!! The food (silently drools) 6 orders and nothing amiss! Steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare), chicken and waffles was great. Another person ordered shrimp and grits and couldn't stop raving about how happy they were over this choice. I can't really remember the other orders but no one was disappointed. We also ordered some shareables. The donut plate which I thought would be mini donuts but they were more like donut holes, still delicious though. The lobster roll was fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Prices are great! We split the bill between us and everyone paid 42. 42 dollars for amazing food and bottomless champagne ?! This is probably what heaven looks like.  If you need a new spot, go go go! Seriously stop reading and GO!",

The waiter we had was amazing and made our disappointment a little less. I had the Beef Wellington and my wife had the hanger, the Wellington was enjoyable but the hanger was on the overcooked side for medium well. They had no mocktails or non alcoholic beer and the lemonade is minute maid so it was water all night. I have to say I enjoyed the corn bread more than I enjoyed my whole $150 meal.   I am sure this restaurant appeals to a lot of individuals with the non traditional feel but could try to appease the both sides of the spectrum a little.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to come check out this place ever since it opened, and we finally had a chance to come last Thursday night.  Some food is very good and some are bland.  The corn bread they brought out while waiting for our meal was definitely very yummy.  My boyfriend had the Caesar salad, lobster roll and they were very good.  I had the salmon and we shared a side dish of roasted cauliflower.  The cauliflower had great flavor and very good.  I must say the salmon and the stuff on it is very very bland.  I couldn't even taste a hint of salt or any other flavoring.  I had to put a lot of salt to make it even somewhat flavorful, and I usually don't put too much salt on my food.  The service was not the greatest either.  It took awhile for our server to take our food order.  Since my boyfriend wanted the lobster roll as his meal, he told the server to serve the Caesar salad first.  But the lobster roll came out first, so we told the server that's not what we wanted.  So they took the lobster roll back and brought out the Caesar salad and because of the mistake, they brought an extra salad for me (even though I didn't order one).  They just assumed that I wanted one??  My boyfriend ended up eating both salad plates.  After we were done with the salad, they brought out the lobster roll again and brought an extra empty plate for me.  The lobster roll is not on the main dish section on the menu, so they thought that it was still part of our appetizer and we were going to share it, even though we told the server that was going to be his meal.  So we told the server again about the mistake and wondering where my meal (salmon) was.  I was afraid that they hadn't even started making my meal and that I had to wait longer.  But luckily they had that ready.  Then of course that meal was extremely bland.  I was very hungry, so I still ate it all.  Then for our troubles, they gave us 3 small pieces of donut creme brulee, which I thought had weird after taste, like some bitter taste that stayed on your tongue.  I wasn't a fan of it.  We also saw at another table how the servers were serving the meals for a table of 4 (2 men, 2 women).  They looked totally confused on who had what meal so it took them awhile to finally start serving them.  When they finally figured it out, they served the men first, the women last, and the side dishes were brought out individually from the kitchen.  My boyfriend is in the service industry and he couldn't believe what he was seeing.  So needless to say, we think the service was quite horrible for a supposed to be \"fine dining\" restaurant.  By the way, my boyfriend had worked with Elizabeth Blau during her time with Steve Wynn years with Mirage, Bellagio.  He said that she was very meticulous with quality of food and service and would have never allowed this to happen during her watch.  That's why this was very disappointing for him.  We also had an even worse experience at Honey Salt last year for Valentines Day.  We wrote an email, but never received a response to this date.  We will never go back to Honey Salt.  Again, very disappointing to see this happening at a restaurant owned by a very well renown couple in the industry.",

Thin, no nice crust and not much flavor. Quite honestly Outback would have done better. The fingerling potatoes? Overcooked. The Mac as a side. Average.  The steak was substandard vs what they promote. Rather disappointing.  The dessert was good.  Would not recommend this place if you are expecting a top notch steak.",

I liked the seating arrangements because there was enough space for a couple to sit or a big group of rowdy people to enjoy their Sunday together while watching TV. The service was very attentive and it gave the restaurant that extra level of fancy feel.  I ordered avocado toast, brussel sprouts, and potatoes.

They put us in their back room...then nearly forgot about us.  Drinks didn't come out for 20 minutes and were either wrong or served to the incorrect person.  Food came out to the 15 of us one plate at a time over 15 minutes.  When I went to speak to the manager, she was in shock and said she'd be right on it.  Minutes went by... guests sat around awkwardly...I went back...more waiting, more screwed up drinks...  Finally, as we're wrapping up and about to get up, the manager makes this grand gesture of bringing out 4 open bottles of champagne to pour to a group that included one pregnant woman, 3 people who didn't drink alcohol...and the rest of us...who were DONE being there.  I waited to post this at the request of my wife who had to go back weeks later with her company, and again, it got a less than stellar review.  Bummer... haven't returned since.",

The drinks were good but we only wanted one each and had to reiterate that a couple of times with different servers, (felt like a little bit of sales pressure on the drinks throughout our meal).  The homemade donuts with creme brulee filling are amazing!  Love ambience of this restaurant as it's light and airy and has a lot of very comfortable seating.",

Both were extremely fresh with a ton of amazing flavor. The oysters were also very delicious and came with a champagne vinaigrette. For our entree we both ordered the ribeye with a side of mac and cheese and jalapeno churros. Both of the items were absolutely amazing and with such generous portions we could not finish it all! The service was spectacular and we never had to look for a waiter. Our waiter was mauriciano and he went above and beyond expectations! Thank you andiron we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My husband was sweet enough to take me here for my birthday tonight and I have to say that for a steakhouse that comes so highly rated I was highly disappointed with our experience. I order my steak medium. And I don't know if it's because we got there at 7 and they close at 9 so they were very lacks when it came to the quality there were putting out but my steak was seriously rare. I tried to eat around the parts I could but I was so disappointed. Then it appeared they had a lot of birthday because they kept bringing out the donut with the candle. Well when it came to my turn I didn't even get my little candle. Now I'm not a race card person or anything so I'm not going to say or would hope that's not why my table and the only other table with African Americans at also sent back their food but for something that may seem so small it was special for my birthday and I nor my family got treated like we were anything special. I was even going to go as far as speak with the manager but after I say the other couple I previously mentioned spoke with him I actually saw the manager go to the waiter they complained about and laugh and just shake his head at the table like \"just another angry customer \" coming from working in customer service I can't say I was surprised but I was shocked he didn't even bother to hide his nonchalant attitude towards paying customers!! Now I don't think anyone will care about this review but I will say I will not be back. From the food lacking in flavor to the staff lacking in customer service there is much to be desired.",

Though the restaurant is known for unique flavors and quality, that was not the case for us. My husband had steak and I had seafood. The steak was not high quality and lacked flavor yet it was expensive. I gave the waiter specific instructions for my dish and they were ignored. Between the drinks, appetizers and dinner the bill was high. I would gladly pay the price if the quality was worth it, but it wasn't. Sorry gang, I won't be back. I've been here before and I noticed a marked difference this time.",

A little over the top but super friendly. The menu is pretty simple. We placed our order and the drinks came quickly. Dinner followed not to long after. The steaks were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Delicious and tender. The sides were smaller than what we are used to from other steak places. Service throughout the night was great. Overall, the ambiance was ok, not for a romantic quiet place. It was not busy at all, food was delicious. The only reason we didn't give a 5 is because they are very over priced with smaller portions. I'm glad we had a Groupon, probably won't be back. We can go closer to home for more bang for our buck!!",

    "text": "Andiron Steak & Seafood provided a lovely and tasty meal.    DECOR: I immediately enjoyed the open classic colonial meets modern Caribbean vibe. The soft greens and whites were crisp and inviting. And yeah, I'm a sucker for live music and had already decided I was in the right place when I walked past the band.  THE MENU: Lots of steaks and updated versions of steakhouse fare.  I was pleasantly surprised by the salad options and vegetarian selection available. Those options (along with the fish) seemed to compliment the light vibe of the space.  I TASTED: the little gem lettuce salad, branzino, rib cap, classic mac an cheese, mac and cheese waffle, polenta, the strip, rib eye, pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla and salted caramel ice cream.  Our group of seven ate and drank (our own wine with corkage fee) for under $600 and I thought that was reasonable.   SERVICE: I wish I had written down our servers name---after a few glasses of wine, her name eludes me. But her kindness and responsiveness does not. I love when servers steer me toward (and away from) dishes. Every one of her suggestions was spot on. At one point I decided to make a change to my order and she was entirety accommodating. No attitude or annoyance (which she probably felt). We did spot the hostess grabbing a few bites of fries from the kitchen and that was a bit disappointing in a fine dining establishment, but it did not sully the service or our experience.   OVERALL: Everything was tasty--the steaks and little gem lettuce salad were the standouts. The steaks were cooked perfectly with that fatty char that I like.  My primary issue with the food was that there seemed to be a small misstep with a number of the dishes. Nothing that kept me from eating (and enjoying) them, but certainly from loving them.  In short, there was just one thing about each dish that kept it from being great. For example, the bacon in the delicious gem salad (think modern wedge) was difficult to cut and made the dish a bit unwieldy.  In my eyes, an off note on an otherwise fantastic plate.  The same issue crept into the dessert dish--the caramel ice cream with chocolate flakes was delish--but there were icy flakes on the each scoop. They weren't terrible, they just took away from the refinement of the dish.  The dish that everyone was dying to taste--that mac and cheese waffle---didn't do it for me or many in our party. I'd order their luxurious polenta over it every day of the week.   I'm not sure I'd plan to go out of my way to visit Andiron, but I would go back if I was looking for an upscale steak while visiting downtown Summerlin.",

    "text": "Andiron Steak & Sea... Well where do we start? Located in Downtown Summerlin is where you can find this place right across the street from the Lazy Dog restaurant. It's always nice to finally check off one of the many bookmarks on your YELP and Andiron has been on my list for quite sometime.   One of my friends wanted to treat me for a happy belated birthday brunch and let me pick the place. I have been in the mood lately for bottomless mimosas and a good breakfast so I thought to myself why not? I placed a reservation on OpenTable to ensure we would get seated in a good amount of time as I had already knew that they can get pretty busy. I received an e-mail from OpenTable after leaving stating that they marked me as a \"No-Show\" which was insane causing me to have to e-mail them back to prove I actually was there but I'll digress.... Anyways, when I arrived I couldn't help but notice how nice and clean everything looked! This place has great decor and I'm guessing on Sunday's a live DJ.   Prior to even visiting on this particular morning I had decided to look at the menu and get a feel for what I would wanted  once I arrived. One thing for sure was that we definitely wanted our bottomless mimosas while waiting for the food! They offer a grapefruit sage that I'd be eyeing and my friend went with a traditional one.  Our order consisted of:  Avocado Toast ($10)- Tomato, Pickled Fresno Chile, Arugula grilled on wheat bread.  Chilaquiles ($19) Pulled Chicken, Avocado Cream, Queso Fresco, Sunny Side Egg.  \"The Benedict\" ($16)- English Muffin, Poached Eggs, Spinach Shaved Porchetta, Breakfast Potatoes, Bearnaise  Overall the entire meal was very underwhelming and I can honestly say that it was just \"meh\" for what the prices are. I really had high hopes for this place but the glitz and glamour doesn't match the food quality I just really thought I'd be amazed. My friend also chimed in and told me that her Chilaquiles was not up to par.. With my eggs benedict they offered an option of upgrading it with Smoked Salmon for $7 extra or Butter Poached Lobster for $10. I went with the salmon because that's my favorite and I've had this same dish at other places countless times and paid way less for a better taste. My English muffin was burnt a bit underneath and the other one wasn't toasted enough. I didn't want to look ungrateful to my friend so I didn't want to send anything back but sheesh that was not a well spent $100 brunch. We have no problem paying for great food and there wasn't anything great about it.. Not quite sure I will return...",

The room is bright and cheerful of white and blue. It was spacious and attractive with a gorgeous bar at the front.   We all ordered something different. Salads, seafood, steak and dessert were all served up in timely fashion and tasted like perfection.   Service was attentive and pleasant. The bartender was gracious and personable. The server was informative and helpful.   Located in a lovely shopping center, it would be a great way to end your day. After buying all your goodies, stop in for a tasty libation, appetizer or full meal.",

The price point was reasonable. They just revamped and added a few new items to the menu. And I am so glad cuz it was delicious!!!   Grilled branzino- 5 stars. It was cooked PERFECTLY I couldn't believe how soft and moist the fish was. The sauce on the bottom definitely adds a nice touch.   My faves were:  Creamed corn - 4 stars  Roasted carrots- 5 stars. Just do it. Butter poached Maine lobster - 4 stars  Heirloom melon salad - 4 stars.  Service was incredible 5 stars.   My fave desserts gotta be the one with the chocolate.",

The brunch burger is awesome and a really big portion, you could probably share it. And the candy bar in the front is so great!

My husband didn't know I ate a sushi roll and some egg rolls a couple hours before hand so I wasn't super hungry.   I thought this would be a great opportunity to try some of their seafood appetizers . I decided to take a chance on the Grilled Octopus ($15.00) . This was taking a big leap of faith since I haven't really tried octopus ...there was a piece of an octopus in a Bloody Mary I had a summer ago but that was it.  When it came out it was a bit charred on the outside but really tender on the inside. It came with fingerling potatoes , pickled peppers with romesco. The pickled peppers went so well with this dish.  I ate every little pepper on my plate!   My second choice was the Shrimp Cocktail ($16.00). I think it's always fun to see how each restaurant will serve it. Will it be in a glass....hmmm the anticipation! Andiron Steak  serves them on a plate just so you know. The shrimp are nice in size and very fresh! I ate some of the biscuits as well which were very good!    We ended our dinner on a sweet note. I knew that they are known for their Creme Brulee Donuts so I figured they would always be there. We tried one of their featured desserts instead. The Andrion \"Snikkers\" Bar ($9.00) is their take on a Snickers bar . It was made with 64% Vairohna  chocolate mousse, peanut nougat, and salted caramel peanuts. It was a perfect ending to a hot evening.   I remember thinking how wonderful it was to have a nice restaurant so close rather than treking to the strip. The ambiance reminded me of the Hamptons (honestly I've never been to the Hamptons...I'm just going by what I see in the movies) It had a relaxed vibe to it.  I would love to come back and experience their brunch!",

I had a dessert table with tons of candies cookies,brownies also little cakes that was absolutely delicious and very pretty to look at. I had the blueberry ricotta waffle and I would have to say it was one of the best waffles I have ever tasted. The whipped cream that was on top of the waffle was freshly made in house and it tasted great and the syrup was one-of-a-kind. My mom got the BLT sandwich and the bread was grilled and I thought it was a great spin on a BLT. For me do you winner was the atmosphere. The restaurant was located in a quiet spot,the music was Nice and it wasn't too loud I could still hear myself talk and hear my mom talk over the music the weather was beautiful the  outside area was clean and it was overall a wonderful experience and because of that waffle I am a regular for Sunday brunch",

We started with the Donut Plate, Lobster Roll and Bottomless Mimosas.  They also have a build your own Bloody Mary Bar.  For our entrees we shared the Lobster Benedict and Chilaquiles.  Food was excellent.  The Donut Plate and Lobster Roll were my favorite.  If you add the lobster to your Eggs Benedict know they just put it on the plate.  It is not actually on your Benedict.  Not a big deal we were just surprised. We loved the Dessert Bar it had Bit O Honey!  My favorite candy.  Also some delicious Fruit Loop and Cocoa Puff treats.     Service was extremely slow and I think there might have been some kind of mix up in the kitchen.  A party of 4 next to us who arrived and ordered after us got their food first.  Our server rarely checked back and had to be hunted down for the check and still took forever.  The young man refilling water and champagne was on his game though.  He kept us topped off and eventually got our check for us.  If you are looking for a delicious and extremely leisurely brunch this is the spot.",

One tends to wonder if it's going to be any good when it's this empty at dinner time.  We were seated immediately in a corner table near the back of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive. We were offered corn bread until we were ready to order. I went with the soy braised short rib with turnip puree and parsnips. The presentation was amazing. The meat was failing off the bone delicious. OMG. I wish I could copy this recipe at home.  It was so tender I could cut it with a fork and moist, melt in your mouth goodness.  If you are cruising your Groupon app and run across the Andiron buy it. It's 60 dollars worth of food for thirty dollars.",

Our waiter was rarely around and barely talked to us. I thought it was odd that he didn't tell us about the specials of the day and at the end of the meal didn't offer dessert and basically disappeared. We had to flag him down to get our bill. However, when we ordered our food, it came out in no time.   Our friend Ms. L got the bottomless mimosas and the staff was pretty great about keeping her glass full. Hubby ordered a coffee and was quite pleased with the quality. They also both ordered the chilaquiles. Luckily, Ms. L shared hers with me. I got the French Toast (which hubby ate half off because it was a pretty decent serving). I was happy to have some savory and some sweet. The chilaquiles were solidly decent. I'm crazy about mushy tortilla chips for whatever reason. I loved their salsa and I loved that it didn't have any beans. I have to say the Pulled chicken was tender, but had absolutely no flavor. I was content to pick around it and enjoy the rest.   But I think my French Toast was great! It was super moist and tender, perfectly absorbing the maple syrup. And even better that it was topped with strawberries, whipped cream and comes with a side of strawberry jam. There's a lot of very mediocre French Toast out there - thank goodness this place delivered!  At brunch they offer a complementary candy bar. It's mostly little hard candies with a few plates of chocolate chip cookies and rice krispy treats. I had to try everything, of course. But I feel everything was actually very meh. The Cookies were tender, but just not very exciting. And treats didn't have enough marshmallow for tastes, which made them crunchy as opposed to chewy.    But I wouldn't be against returning. I can deal with bad service. I'd love to have the French Toast again or give something else a try.",

It's a good thing my dad ordered jumbo shrimps on the side. They were kind enough to replace my mom's New York strip with linguini and clams but it came out TOO SALTY! My flatiron was supposed to be medium well and it was really red!   Apparently, their chef requires a medical clearance from your cardiologist and your dentist!  On a positive note, they have the coolest cutlery! And the ambiance is very cozy! I'm definitely going to need the name of heir interior designer!",

The restaurant is fancy with fancy prices.......thats why I only come during happy hour. Decor is classy. Their plates match the gentlemans ties and wall paper hahaha. Its located in downtown Summerlin across from Lazy Dogs. If you check in, you can get a free dessert, 1 per table. The first 3 pages on the drink menu are 1/2 off during happy hour. The bar has 2 TVs which play the games or events. Last time I was there, they were showing the UFC fight and a football game simultaneously.....although there was no volume. I have not had bruch or dinner here because its too pricey. Ill stick to happy hour $1 oysters.",

No bread service was offered to our table. Corn soup was so bland, everyone who ordered had to salt and pepper the food. I Never salt my food.   My \"seared\" scallops that I asked to be cooked well throughout came out a honey brown color and raw inside. When sent back, the same ones that I had taken a bite out of came back out (questionable, but fine) the same color and each in a pool of liquid.  I can't think of how else you can accomplish this but to microwave :( I didn't even finish a whole one.   Gnocchi is a pass as well, our guest had a few bites then tossed the rest. Salmon was fine. Overall, food was bland and not memorable. The 2 stars are for the server Renee, and the gentleman helping her.   Lobster rolls are solid. What a disappointment, I really wanted to like this place, maybe if I'm feeling brave one day, I'll come for HH.",

    "text": "A friend and I met here on a Saturday morning for brunch. The company was great, but the brunch was just okay. We had a table on the patio which was perfect on a lovely day. For late on a Saturday morning the restaurant was not overly busy.   To start our meal we shared Avocado Toast as well as Burrata & Figs. The shareables were my favorite part of the meal with both being very good. The Avocado Toast was simple, but fresh and delicious. There were four pieces which was a nice serving for sharing. The Burrata & Figs was also very fresh and had a delicious combination of ingredients. The burrata was creamy and delicious on the persimmon and pear slices. I would definitely order this again.   Since one of their specialties is steak I decided to order the Chef's Cut Steak & Eggs. There wasn't anything wrong with this dish, but it wasn't anything special either. It was similar to what I'd expect if I ordered this from a chain breakfast spot. The steak was nicely flavored, but not overly tender. The eggs were prepared as requested and the potatoes were lightly seasoned. My friend's Chilaquiles looked great so I may return in the future to try something else. I would probably return just for the shareables!",

Wife and son enjoyed their wines. Wife had the branzino fish--said it was bland with not much flavor at all. my son had the NY strip and called it \"passable\". I had the NY strip bone in....thought it was \"odd shaped\", undercooked and quite chewy. Had to \"spit out\" a few fatty pieces. not good. Cauliflower side was good...mac and cheese side was dry. Didn't care for our server..although her assistant..who did all the work..was excellent. On a Saturday night..restaurant was only half full. Did we pick a bad night or typical experience?",

We arrived early when the bar was empty and had the time to chat up the bartender. We questioned him about how the HH specials work and were impressed with selections.  The bartender understood that we were interested in taking advantage of special pricing and let him know we would be coming back for wine specials and to have dinner.  All was well until we received the check-  we understood descriptions of specials and we ordered Negronis to start the evening.  We continued to order several food choices and wine.  Sadly, the Negronis were not discounted - it was crystal clear we were interested in HH specials and we should have been told our drink choice was not included.  When we questioned the bill we received a poor excuse.  We were told that 'well drinks' did not include Negronis but 80% of all other drinks were included- really unacceptable. We are new residents to the Summerlin area and we were hoping Andiron was going to be our'go to' spot with new friends and visitors.  We will not be running back.",

    "text": "I was looking for a place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Every year we try to go to a new place. Michael's Gourmet Room, Del Frisco's, etc. I wanted to try SW this year but my wife requested something \"casual\", she's not a fan of snooty tuxedoed servers :) I picked Andiron based on positive reviews but the experience was disappointing.  Cocktails:  We've had a few Andiron martinis and Hennesy Passions. Cocktails are $14 apiece, but the execution does not warrant the price. The only highlight was blue cheese stuffed olives in the martinis.  Oysters: Kumi oysters at $3 each were pretty fresh but still with a bit of fishy aftertaste. Champagne mignonette accompanying them was quite good.  Salmon sashimi: Very greasy, drowning in oil. For $14 you get five minuscule thin strips of fish. Not worth it.  Lobster roll: For $19 you get two small \"lobster salad\"  sandwiches on grilled bread. Bread was tasty, lobster salad tasted like imitation crab salad. Very bland, you pretty much just taste the mayo, lobster was very chewy. Definitely not worth it.  Steak: That was the biggest letdown from a place that calls itself a steakhouse. We got the Ribeye cap ($34), which we ordered medium. The pathetic thing that showed up was completely charred black on the outside and was still completely raw and bloody inside. The flavor/seasoning was ok. In all honesty, it should've been sent back but at that point we didn't care to bother and wanted to finish dinner and get out of there. The Andiron sauce that came with it is something of a cross between A1 and barbecue sauce, rather gross.  Kennebec Fries: Was probably the only thing we really enjoyed. Best $7 we spent that evening. Very interesting smoky taste and the accompanying smoked tomato aioli was quite good as well.  Service:  The waitor was friendly enough but seemed completely indifferent. Didn't bother to check up on us and most of the service was handled by bus boys. The kid that brought all the food out was a bit weird. Not rude, but he would kinda just slam the plates down. \"Salmon sashimi, it has fennel in it\". Just felt a bit weird.  We let the server know it was my wife's birthday. The fact was acknowledged but absolutely nothing was done about it. Maybe because we didn't bother ordering dessert after the very unappetizing steak.  Took forever to get the check and even longer to have it brought back. The host came by when he saw I was starting to get a little hot under the collar and explained it away with \"computer troubles\".  Overall, the vibe I got from everyone was that no one really wanted to be there.  Based on our experience I definitely will not be going back nor can I recommend the place to others. In this price range Echo and Rig in Tivoli Village is an infinitely better choice. They definitely know how to properly prepare a steak.",

Service was pretty good although I did feel the server being a little pushy on the up-selling side instead of recommending all the best things to eat.  Ok so lets get to the food.  For appetizers we got half dozen oysters, nothing too special here but some good quality oysters, but i don't believe they told us what kind they were.  The steak tartar was awesome so I definitely recommend this one.  If you MUST try the mac n cheese waffle because of the hype then go for it but it's not going to amaze you and this will be best shared by 4 people unless you don't on eating an entree.  Tried the wagyu flatiron which was pretty decent and the chimmichurri sauce it came with was awesome.   So overall, it's not a horrible place to try, but it wasn't anything special either.  If you're looking for a really nice place to be at though, away from the strip, this place wouldn't be so bad.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in this restaurant... the service was good, not stellar, but it was fine. The food on the other hand, for the price, was awful. $12 mediocre Caesar salad, $45 8oz filet with no flavor and way too much gristle for a filet. Charred carrots that were supposed to just be \"roasted\". Mac and cheese was okay. The best part of dinner was the artichokes at the beginning and I still like the ones from BJ's better. I love wine, but I have a hard time paying $120 for a $30 bottle of wine. I kept looking at $50-$60 bottles and the server would try to sell me a bottle that was double the price instead. Finally settled on a $75 cab (one I buy regularly for $20) from their sommelier's recommendation list, and then he came back and said he couldn't find it! If it's in your recommendation list, MIGHT want to make sure you have it! So he brought the more expensive one with him. I gave into that one because we were now almost 30 minutes in... Overall, it was NOT worth the $225 price tag for two people who shared an entree... sounds like some people really enjoy their happy hour, so I may be back for that, but definitely not dinner. So many other places actually worth that high-priced check!   UPDATE: I was contacted right away by a manager to apologize for our experience. We have since been back for dinner and had a much better overall experience.",

    "text": "This is my final update as I have now experienced all that Andiron has to offer.  A True 5 star experience this time.  We started at the bar area for a surprisingly nice HH.  Until 7pm (very late for Vegas, they offer half off beer, wine, and specialty cocktails.  They also had $1 oysters all day on tuesdays.  The oysters were a little small but for a $11 and a great dipping sauces I can survive.  As usual, the cocktail I ordered, the Manhattan, was exceptional.  The wine selection was very nice by the glass as well.  We then sat down for dinner and ordered the appetizer, dinner, dessert option for about $40, plus a wine pairing for $10 extra.  The wine didn't really \"pair\" as we ordered two different appetizers and two different entrees and got the same white then red selections, but still for $10 and about a 4-5oz pour per meal (2 total), I thought it was a nice accompaniment.  The meal began with some fresh cornbread which was very good.  We then had the squash soup and caesar salad for appetizers, pasta and rib for dinner, and the donuts and lemon pie for dessert.  We also added brussel sprouts as a side, which although perhaps the best part of the meal, was overkill as the portion sizes are solid without ordering another side.  The salad was good, not great, but the squash soup was very nice and creamy; great for dipping.  Both entrees were quite good with nice sauces and big portions.  The desserts, especially the lemon pie, were outstanding.  The meal ended with a complimentary tart which was the best dessert of the 3 and just too small as it left me wanting more.  You will be thoroughly content and full after this meal.  Especially for the price, you can't go wrong with this tasting option as many of the dishes I was going to order anyways were options here.  Our only issue with the dinner was that we didn't want dessert but were unable to maneuver around the meal and either remove a dessert and add an appetizer, or upgrade an entree.  One of the best restaurants in Vegas.",

Wow their adult grilled cheese with Brie and apples combined with their homemade (and served warm) chips were amazing! Then the table also had the lobster eggs Benedict and their chicken Caesar salad ( fresh grilled chicken skin and bone in served warm!)  I can't say enough about how good everything was!! Just go and try this brunch for yourself. If I could have given them a 10 I would have. And the service here is so friendly and efficient. Just love this restaurant. And do try the cream puffs! We were super happy we did and I don't even like desserts.   We had a delightful dinner with friends! The service here is totally on point.   We never wanted for anything during our entire meal. We had two orders of salmon that were cooked as requested and the foie gra appetizer was lovely.  We also had two caesar salads and finished it off with the squash soup. And everything was delicious!  We will define you be back.",

I must say I really wasn't that impressed for such an expensive dinner.  Our reservation was messed up because we arrived late, but that was our fault.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for our booth (which was right in the middle of the room) and extremely noisy.  I couldn't even carry on a conversation with my husband because of the noise.  The waiter was nice enough, however, after I mentioned the Ribeye as my choice I was informed that is no longer a choice (although it is STILL) on the menu.  So my choices were go higher (New York steak) or lower (skirt steak) of course, the price on the New York steak was about $10 more.  Everything is ordered separate, so I asked if there would be enough for two to share, I was assured by the waiter there would be plenty!  The bus boy then advised us he would bring out some bread when it was done baking.  What a joke, he brought out 3 cornbread muffins that looked like they came out of the pop n fresh can.  They tasted dry and flaky.  No thanks.  The Caesar salad had a fish taste to it (anchovies?), I wasn't especially happy with and would have liked to be warned about.  The food was adequate, not great!  If not for Groupon we would never have come here and after paying $114 for two adequate dinners, we won't be coming here again.",

    "text": "I was a little unsure about trying this place out as I had read mixed reviews on Yelp but friends wanted to go so.... Upon entering, this restaurant has a beautiful ambience and is suppose to look like you are in the Hamptons. They did a great job trying to convey this feeling except there was no ocean breeze. Darn it!! We sat indoors but I also noticed that there was patio dining available when cooler temperatures abound. Initially, our server allowed us plenty of time to get comfortable as we were talking and catching up but then I started to wonder when he was coming back....He did finally and was attentive moving forward to a degree but not the service you would expect from a fine dining establishment. I ordered the Alaskan Halibut with pressed peas, poblano peppers, edamame within a crime sauce. I found it to be tasty but not outstanding. Then again I just got over a cold and my tastebuds may still be a bit off. My friend had one of the steaks which she felt was a bit dry. My other friend had the salmon which had a ham crust. She enjoyed this dish and found it light, and juicy. We also ordered the crime brulee donuts as other Yelpers seemed to rave about these gems and I agree they were worth it! The wine list is extensive and has a wide variety to choose from but very pricey. There was really no price break from a half bottle to a full bottle. We ended up enjoying a glass of wine each. I would have to say I prefer Honey Salt to this restaurant.",

Love the flower wall paper. Live music was nice as well.   It was 530, so we sat in the lounge area so we could order a few items from the overtime menu (happy hour) that goes from 5-7.   Ordered:  Mule-made with lemon vodka here, really enjoyed it.   Oyster shooters-tiny tiny oysters. Fresh and good, but barely any oyster! not really worth two dollars a piece. Didn't understand how to do the oyster shooter with the Bloody Mary mix on the side..ended up just sipping on the Bloody Mary mix ha. Would be willing to try the oysters on the normal menu if different than these.   Chopped vegetable salad-good, nothing too amazing here.   Hudson Valley Foie Gras-will start off by saying this is my first time trying Foie Gras so did not know what to expect and have nothing to compare it to. Enjoyed the combination of it with the blueberries and bread. Very rich, definitely something to share   Mac n Cheese waffles-the star of this menu. Waiter highly recommended it. It was very delicious, but so rich. The sauce that came with it was cold so we had to send it back to be heated up. Sauce was good but no idea what it was and doesn't say anywhere on the menu  Hanger steak with creamed spinach and French fries- the steak was delicious and well cooked. My mom thought it was too salty but I did not agree. The creamed spinach was cold. Since we had already sent the sauce for the waffle back we didn't bother sending this back as well. I hate when food isn't hot or at least warm. Fries were nothing special   Creme brulee donuts-YUM. Loved the filling and the burnt sugar taste of the \"brulee\" sugar on the outside of the donut. Very good.   Service was super slow as well as some mishaps on cold food and some things just didn't wow for the price. But the steak, dessert and atmosphere were all wins.",

The food was pretty good but the waitress ruined the experience for us.   She stopped by once maybe twice and we had to flag her down if we ever needed anything. She was very accommodating to all her other tables but when she came to us she was very short. At some point we gave up looking for her and just asked a buster who was much friendlier and helpful. Food was good but service sucked.",

Andiron gets it right down to the very last detail.  When you walk in, you feel you are transported to the veranda of a rich, Southern debutante.  It's all sandalwood, flowing, gauzy drapes, and has a beautiful open kitchen that manages to be interesting without making the noise volume unbearable.    Our incredible dinner started off right with oysters and steak tartare.  Both were great, but our server's recommendation to try the tartare was spot on.  It had a spicy kick that we all loved.  We had a variety of steaks and all were very good.  By far, everyone's favorite was the mac n cheese waffle.  I am not a lover of mac n cheese, but this waffle creation is nothing short of amazing.  My biggest mac n cheese complaint is the texture.  With a mac n cheese waffle, it's crunchy and cheesy all at that same time.  At the same time! Genius!  For dessert, we put a world of hurt on two slices of brown butter lemon pie.    I have so many wonderful things to say about this place, I could write a novella.  Suffice it to say, this is an awesome addition to the Summerlin dining scene.  Be prepared to spend some $$$.  Perfection does not come cheap.",

My bf got the hanger steak. It's definitely not horrible but also not amazing. The calamari was tender which was good but nothing special as far as flavor. My scallops were not that great. They were tender but I've had better caramelized scallops elsewhere as far as taste and quality. I personally feel that you pay for the ambience. The place is very modern looking and nice but the food was just average for us. Service was good. It's something worth trying once and not coming back for. Nothing really stood out to me.",

    "text": "My last review was for a straight five stars and the experience was wonderful. We had great service and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, my second time around for brunch was very disappointing and the restaurant gets three stars because it became average and some place I would not go back to again, despite not being terrible. I started with the avocado toast again, and it was very different from the last time. Last time it was fresh and lovely with avocado and a few vegetables on top of very good toast. This time around, a bunch of very hot peppers were placed on top which tasted very different from the last time and I found it very unpleasant. What bothered me most is that nowhere on the menu did it say hot spicy peppers and that is something that a restaurant should warn anyone that is not into very spicy food about. They did not and, compared to last time, where it was very different, it was a fail. We also ordered the sesame bagel with both lox cold salmon as well as cooked salmon with cream cheese and that was good, but I would just have made it lox without the cooked salmon, which wasn't very good nor was it needed. I then asked the waiter what he thought of the Summerlin omelette, as the last time I got the skillet which was very good, with fresh eggs and potatoes and ham and bacon and it was very good. The waiter told me that the Summerlin omelette is lovely and fresh. What??? It was absolutely disgusting. It was made to sound like this fantastic omelette that had all kinds of vegetables and cheese in it. All it was was a pathetic omelette with cheese in it that looked rolled up like something you could make in anyone's cheap kitchen with some salad on top. Grossly disappointing and an absolute no to order again or to even consider having anyone order! It was terrible! What made it even more disappointing is that it came with two slices of toast, and you did not have a choice to the kind of toast that you wanted, but when I asked for jam, the restaurant didn't have any! They brought a small side of applesauce? For brunch, no jam... Really? My friend ordered the Chilaquiles which was made with chicken, and my friend who is authentic and is Mexican, when it comes to Latin cuisine, explained that the chicken was not needed and she kept putting it aside because it wasn't making the dish successful. We did order the creme brulee donuts and they were just OK. Know that you do not have to order dessert as the restaurant offers, complementary, a candy bar with brownies and cookies, all for free. They also offer a bottom less option for bloody Marys where they have a bar with all kinds of options set up to make it or bottomless Mimosas with specific flavors. They are both OK. Overall, we had a difficult time with service which was not as good and it almost seems like either they were not around or they were shorthanded. I will not be coming back here for brunch as it was an unpleasant experience and I'm disappointed because the last time it was very good. There are much better places for brunch that have consistency each and every time and so we're going to stick to those places from now on.",

    "text": "UPDATE: Managed to get in here on a WE night for Happy Hour. The menu for such is largely drink based - half off a selection of brews, wines, and cocktails. They do offer a special on oysters which are well worth it. Tried a few regular menu appetizers in addition to the oysters: fried chicken bao buns, poke, grilled octopus and one entree; grilled branzino with a side of grilled broccolini. Appetizers are a funny thing for many restaurants but not here. All three were done with the same care and attention to presentation and taste of an entree. My dining companion and I were torn over which was best. Whereas bao buns tend to disappoint in many establishments these were done with aplomb. Grilled octopus done well is one of my favorites and these are among the best I've had - even in Spain where they're highly coveted. The Poke was equally well done and comes with thin crisps and a smeer of what I think was a spicy avocado along the inside of the bowl. Delightful. I've had the grilled branzino and broccolini in the past and both were an accomplishment. My compliments to the chef. Wait service was prompt, informed and perfectly paced. Overall a dining experience well worth a five star rating. It's not cheap but if you plan on splurging for a mean then Andiron is well worth the time and money.   Original review: Would have originally written a review about the food, service, decor, etc but got turned away. Went here for happy hour and the bar area - where happy hour occurs - was kind of busy with just one table left. Tried to sit down but was told by the server that it was reserved. A bar seat? During happy hour? Never heard of such a thing. Asked the hostess about it on the way out and she said as far as she knew she couldn't reserve a table in the bar during happy hour. Weird. Oh well. Went to Grape Street instead. Excellent!",

I guess the hostess, was nice, but seriously, why would I wait for brunch at Andiron (or anywhere) when I can go to Wolfgang Puck or MTO?",

    "text": "This restaurant looses one star because of the quality of food, one star for the overpriced menu items vs the quality, and one star for the service. The two stars basically go towards the ambiance of the restaurant.   We went here for my mother in laws 50th birthday. We usually go to Mastro's or Capital but we wanted to try something new. According to YELP this restaurant is amazing and top notch.   Um... No.   If you are a food snob like myself who eats at many different higher end restaurants then you will not enjoy this place. If you are someone who thinks Olive Garden is even remotely good then you would probably love this place.   I enjoyed the decor and the music throughout the restaurant. There were many servers on the floor so your drink never went empty, which was always a plus.   Our food took 35 minutes at least to get to our table. Then, of course my steak was over cooked so they sent it back to the chef. Server lacked personality and didn't smile, he was very serious.   The chef offered me a complimentary salad that was absolutely disgusting. I enjoyed the gesture but I couldn't even eat the salad. Everyone finished their food before mine even came back to the table.   Filet Mignon- nasty charred taste Salmon- my sister in law said it was okay Chicken- brother in law said it was nothing special Hanger steak- uncle said it was really good Burger- husband said it tasted like Applebee's  Loaded baked potato- was amazing  Macaroni and cheese- bland  Shrimp Scampi- overcooked but with good flavor   Total bill for six people: about $500 not including tip",

    "text": "On a recent visit to Las Vegas, my family and I decided to try Andiron for Sunday brunch and we're glad we did. Food and service were outstanding. Juan, our server, took great care of us and made sure we had everything we needed.   Oysters on the half shell were fresh and served with a champagne mignonette, fresh grated horseradish, cocktail sauce and hot sauce (all on the side so you can add according to your taste.) The shrimp cocktail came with some very large shrimp. The donut plate is a great choice for sharing as it comes with a variety of donuts; everyone should be able to find at least one for themselves. My chicken and waffles were right on point. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the waffles crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The \"hot honey\" syrup complemented the dish perfectly. Not too sweet and just enough spice to give it a kick without overdoing it.   I also got the bottomless Bloody Mary, well worth it if you're going to drink at least 2 of them. You get to basically build your own Bloody Mary at the bar. You choose everything: the type of salt on the rim of your glass, the spice level of the mix, any additional hot sauce (the selection of hot sauces is HUGE) along with other condiments like celery, horseradish, bacon, homemade beef jerky, mini shrimp cocktail, peppers and more.   I'm definitely headed back there the next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Andiron for our wedding anniversary this year. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly. The atmosphere and ambience are also great.  We loved the bright, open, airy floor plan. The food was delicious! Instead of the typical \"bread basket\" they serve you mini-cornbreads, which are amazing. For starters, my wife had the corn soup which was, again, delicious. I tried the Grilled Octopus, which was very unique. It's grilled and has a very smoky/charred flavor. Not chewy or tough at all. I'm glad I tried it, but her starter (the soup) was much tastier. My wife chose the Hanger Steak for her entree and it was excellent. Cooked perfectly and very tasty. I had the Serrano Crusted Salmon which is probably the best Salmon dish I have ever had at a restaurant. I love Salmon, but it can tend to be a bit boring so I only order it when I'm in the mood for a lighter/cleaner meal. This Salmon was fantastic. Not only was it cooked perfectly, the serrano crust was very flavorful and added just enough texture. For dessert we had the Custard Filled Doughnuts and the Pretzel Crust Cheesecake. Both were as excellent as they sound. The doughnuts reminded me of french beignets but with custard filling and a dusting of sugar and the pretzel crust added just the right amount of saltiness to the cheesecake. We really enjoyed ourselves here and the staff made the evening very memorable for our anniversary. It's nowhere near where we live but we will gladly return again in the future because it is well worth the drive.",

The rating is for the food and ambiance. The grilled octopus was excellent. Not too salty or mushy. I chose to have the chicken entree which was also very good. I was also with a group of individuals who are very picky about their food preparation and ask for a number of accommodations. All of which are made. That action is always appreciated! The quality of the food was better than most. If you're going to Las Vegas be aware this restaurant is about 25 min away from the strip, which could be exactly what you are looking for if you want something more remote.",

We gave it an 8, our server was cool as heck, but there was no host when we came in. Maybe because it's closer to closing time. We scored two complimentary champagne at at the end because she figured we were on date night! Very sweet of her! I love the fact that new settings are provided for every meal, and you don't have to worry about using dirty spoons or forks for the next meal. Staff is very attentive all throughout our dining.   Food. I thought I would be blown away. Not so much. My husband's steak is great, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. But we've had better steak for sure! My steak was I think over cooked, I would say maybe my fault because I ordered it medium well. But I didn't realize the cut was so thin!  The Jumbo Shrimp is delicious and I love the shishito peppers that was on the plate.   Best part. Mac N Cheese!!! Do order if you go. Calamari is good, it has slight tang and spicy flavor, lightly breaded, on the salty side for me (but my husband who loves salt, is happy about it). I've had better for sure. The desserts are amazing! We ordered the donut creme brulee and carrot cheesecake (seasonal) I think. Also ordered Brussels Sprouts, cooked the way I like it.   Next time (if we go again) I would order fish instead.   We came out there with a bangin $200 bill. To be expected, I think.",

Located in the ever-growing DT Summerlin mall, this seems like it will be a popular spot for all those rich old guys who want to take out-of-towners on an impressive dinner.    Service was also, overall, quite good. Friendly, slightly over-talkative server, but timing of the meal was great (except when it slowed down a bit at the end).    I would almost give this place a 4th star just for their Mac and Cheese Waffle....SO DELICIOUS and that cheese sauce...yum!  However, the remainder of the food was not as impressive. It was good, with fresh ingredients and well cooked, however nothing really stood out. I had the Yellowtail Crudo - which was fresh but nothing special, Skirt Steak - a little over-cooked for medium, and meat was only ok, and finished with Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts - which sadly did not impress me any more than a krispy kreme donut would.   Overall, this is a lovely restaurant and food quality is good. But value-for-price, I would still probably go elsewhere.",

It was Father's Day so the restaurant had a lively buzz.  Ricardo took amazing care of us.  (Truly outstanding service!)  We started with the Andiron donuts--the creme brulee one was especially amazing.  My husband indulged in the bottomless Bloody Mary and he loved the house mix and the cilantro lime salt on the rim.  The selection of garnishes (shrimp!  bacon! okra!) was over the top.  We shared the burrata with heirloom tomatoes and peaches.  It was summer on a plate garnished with decadent pistachios.  Yum!  My husband had the Eggs Benedict with butter poached lobster.  It was fabulous right down to the extraordinary English muffin foundation.  They must make them in house--we forgot to ask--it was flavorful and almost cake-like.  A must try!  I had the salmon tabbouleh bowl.  The fish was cooked to medium and absolutely PERFECT.  Delicious and just the right level of virtuousness to balance those sinfully wonderful donuts we started with.  We very much enjoyed meeting Andrew, a member of the management team as our meal wrapped up.  It was obvious from the way he was working the room that customers come first.  He made us feel so welcome.  Just a terrific experience this time.  We will be back!",

The BF ordered the NY Strip with brussels, mashed and the mac and I ordered the Branzino. It was a lot of food which was nice because we got to have it again the next day. Evetything was perfect.  For dessert we ordered the candy bar. Let me just say that Snickers better step up there game. This was way better by far.  We did bring our own bottle of kick ass wine and the corking fee was $25.

The menu isn't overly saturated, so you don't feel overwhelmed by some of the more interesting options. They start you off with fresh cornbread muffins which are light, fluffy and so warm the butter melted on them as we were spreading it!  We ordered a Little Gem Salad, 14 oz Sirloin, and Mac & Cheese. The salad is ridiculously good! The bacon was so delicious and literally melts in your mouth. I loved the blue cheese dressing and crumbles with the tomatoes. It was perfect! Our steak was cooked so well! I didn't even need the signature sauce they serve with it. The Mac & Cheese is so creamy and cheesy it had strings! We loved it!  We didn't get a chance to try dessert, but there's always next time! Our waiter was phenomenal! He answered all of questions and requests with grace and poise that is such a welcomed treat in this day and age. We are going to be adding Andiron to our date night regiment for sure! Hunny is already planning our next date night!",

    "text": "This review is for Happy Hour only. This was my first visit, here with some friends for a Ladies' Night Out. On Thursdays, HH for ladies is all night, which is great.  Loved the ambiance, which is cool and comfy, like sitting in someone's living room. Two of the women I was with drank so much water that I was afraid they'd get H20 poisoning. The guy pouring the water was always there refilling their glasses; I thought he was part of our group.  Renae, our waitress, was friendly and helpful. The two water guzzlers have been there a number of times and have always been waited on by her, so that may account for the extra-good service. Or maybe she's really good!  The HH menu, like most others, has little in the way of healthy food. Here it's the entire bar menu, with the exception of the burger, which is the only thing I'd consider \"real\" food. I don't ever have a bunch of appetizers and then order dinner, so leaving out the burger didn't make me happy. We ordered avocado toast, bao buns, and calamari/shrimp. I didn't try the bao buns. That worked out well, since there were four of us and three of them. There's a limited amount of fried food I can handle, so one of the four half-slice toast pieces and some calamari wasn't enough for dinner. We got another order of avocado toast.  HH has all wines and most of the cocktails at half price, meaning my glass of wine cost about what I'd pay at any other restaurant without a discount.  I'll probably be back, since my friends love this place. It was okay, but I was not overwhelmed, at least not for Happy Hour. There are better menus out there.",

But the reason I'm giving this place a two stars because their menu. My Brussels were served burned ?! Seriously?! What kind of chef would allow food to leave that way. I always came there at least once a week and ordered oysters, octopus, Brussels and few drinks. Now the octopus is gone and I don't think I'll be coming back.  The positive side is the bar guys, Robert and Marcus are the best bartenders in Las Vegas, probably that the only reason why I might reconsider coming back.",

    "text": "I don't really consider this place a steakhouse, rather a New American restaurant with a choice of steak, seafood, pasta, and some other items you would typically find at a New American establishment.   Came with a group of friends and we ordered a variety of dishes. I tried the 12 oz ribeye at medium rare. It was cooked more medium than rare, but regardless, the cut wasn't very good. Dry and it was served lukewarm. Given the $$$ price for this steak, I was expecting a lot more. But then again, this isn't a steakhouse, right?  I also tried some of the appetizers and sides. The french fries were very good. Crispy outer and soft mushy inner. Not sure if I would come back just for the fries, but order it. The fried artichokes tasted like, well, artichokes, Quite standard. The calamari was underwhelming, especially given the price. Tasted similar to what you would find at any chain restaurant. The mac and cheese dish was creamy and cheesy, and I enjoyed this dish. The cheese quality was up there.  The drinks are \"steakhouse\" pricing so expect to fork over some change to enjoy a shot of Scotch.  I did try a bite of the 20 oz Cowboy ribeye and, yes, it was tasty. Nice marbling, smokey flavor, and very tender. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.  Service was attentive, but food took a little longer than expected. Our dessert, creme brulee donuts tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp for an hour.",

    "text": "Andiron Steak & Sea (Downtown Summerlin / Las Vegas)  You know when Yelpers start off a review with \"I really wanted to love this place\".  You know what's coming up next...their disappointment.  But first off, the food is pretty good.  I have tried the burger & fries, pigs in a blank, the donut flight, the bacon jalapeno churros, the Summerlin omelet, the thick cut bacon, and the now deceased waffle mac n' cheese.  The only issue with the food is the small portions and big price tag.  My favorite is the thick cut bacon.  This single piece of bacon is about the size of a typical tenderloin. If a high calorie fatty dish is what you're looking for, then this is it.  This is a dish worth having.  Like I stated earlier, the food is pretty good.  It's the service that needs improvements.  On our last visit, we waited a very long time for our orders to be taken and an even longer time for the food to be served. I recommend ordering extra water because it's going to take a while for your refill.  During this time, we didn't have a single employee check on us.  As for the check, yes that took a long time too.  I think 3 stars would be a very fair review.  Good food and poor service equals an \"A-Ok\" experience at Andiron.  However, finding hair in the food is enough to drop them one more star.  My overall thoughts...I really wanted to love this place.",

Located in downtown summerlin on the north size of the complex (across from lazy dogs and red rock casino). They offer brunch, and I believe they close mid day to prepare for dinner. I attended their brunch. I had the chicken and waffles paired with the Mac & cheese, sooo good. Tons of flavor, a nicer restaurant so prices are a little higher than other places but definitely paying for quality of your food. They also have this super cute candy/dessert bar in the bar area that you can grab anything from! Bottomless mimosas available for $19",

Short version: Wow, things have really changed at this place.  I love to seeing that our voices were heard, and for the front of house, it is night and day. This a great place to drop into in the Summerlin area.  Long version: Decor/Atmosphere: 5/5 No real news under this section other than now I have gone back twice in the evening so no DJ (which makes complete since). I still love the aesthetics of the place. Very crisp.  Cleanliness: 5/5 In the last 2 visits, it has been absolutely spotless. One of the times was at the beginning of the dinner hour, and the other was in the thick of it.  Both times have been great.  There is no change.  You couldn't tell the amount of traffic that they were dealing with either time from the look of the place.  This time around, the placemats, flatware, stemware, etc were all clean.  Food: 4/5 We intentionally ordered the shrimp and calamari when we were invited back.  It was noticeably fresher.  Honestly, I'm always a little skeptical when invited back to a place because I feel like I'm going to get a dog and pony show (blame it on my career), so I had to order the shrimp cocktail when I went back. No show here. They really fixed it.  It was so much fresher! The standout to me is the beef wellington.  Outstanding! I wanted to do a happy dance in my seat.  My fiance ordered the NY Strip, which he said was very good.  As for the sided, the potato with mine was decadent.  The roasted peppers were perfect. The mac and cheese was okay... It wasn't bad. Just not my favorite. The brussels sprouts and chicken breast were both very good. The beignets were good but not a must have.  The espresso was great and didn't taste burned.  My old fashioned was great on both trips.  Service: 5/5 I got Brian both times.  He's fantastic!  The perfect touch of friendly and efficient. He is one of my all time favorite waiters.  Now if we could clone him or get him to teach others, we'd really be on to something.  It really is the tale of two restaurants. I was really pulling for this place because I love their other restaurants so much that I was really bummed when I had such a bad experience here.  Now, I am absolutely a fan of this place! We eat out so often that it's hard to come by here as frequently as I would like to, but I am glad that we gave this place a second chance.",

They also had a live Dj plying which was a nice touch. It was also super easy to make a reservation via open table.  Once we were seated our waiter gave us a brief run down of the new menu items, complementary candy bar, diy Bloody Mary bar and the different flavors of mimosas. The food & drink options were definitely amazing. I opted for the diy Bloody Mary option which was $24 for bottomless, some of the topping options included different flavored rims, shrimp, beef jerky, carrots, olives, lemons, limes and dozens of hot sauces. So good!  As for food to start we shared the Donut Plate. It had 5 different Donut hole flavors to try. My favorites were the peanut butter and jelly and the maple. They were perfectly cooked and had very rich flavors. (5/5) For an entree I went with the Grown-Up Grilled Cheese. I loved how crispy the Texas toast was and the fried egg on top was an excellent touch. (4/5)  Overall I really loved this place. The only reason I docked one star was for the service being a bit slow. We had to flag down our waiter a few times for refills or to grab our check, but other than that it was all good!",

The waiter brought me some corn muffins to start with some whipped butter.  My meal came quickly and everything was cooked perfectly.

What really made it stand out was the service. My wife and I remarked on it again this morning. What a well-trained, experienced staff they employ. It was that perfect balance of feeling really well attended to but not rushed or \"crowded\" by staff.   In a town where there is a restaurant every 10 feet, Andiron has nailed a huge factor that makes a place stand out from the pack. A definite \"go again\" for our family.",

Don't we know the brain is made up of DHA and grass fed cows perfectly convert the DHA to what our body needs most? Aren't we trying to create return customers? It's all about brain chemistry. Sure, your steaks are great in flavor but corn fed does not create good brain chemistry when it processes, it causes tons of inflammation. A grass fed steak will make customers come back more, that's a fact based on the DHA stimulating massive decreases in inflammation amongst many other benefits and also DHA is a UV light receptor so guess what? What you eat it and go outside the next day your absorb more UV light which means more melatonin created. Another reason their brain will crave your steaks. I love your place, do the right thing and change your steaks to grass fed even if lesser portions. Especially being from the owners of Honey Salt.",

I ordered a special they had.... not sure what the exact name was, but it was the filet mignon with a lobster topping I believe and my boyfriend had the rib eye. The rib eye was good but my filet mignon was horrible!!! I ordered it rare, and it came out with barely any pink. Sent it back.... and they redid it, and the second time came out the exact same!! This is suppose to be a steakhouse and both times my steak came out nearly well done. They apologized and gave me shrimp as I waited for my food, and ended up charging us for it, even though I didn't order it. Lol My boyfriend on the other hand whom ordered the rib eye had his medium rare and was good. But it was sad that this happened and I was so tired and hungry.... I just packed it up then tossed a $60 steak once I walked out. Pretty sad. Check out the pictures and you can clearly tell this is NOT A rare steak.",

Some of us opted for bottomless mimosas ($20), others for the bottomless Bloody Mary bar ($25). The mimosas had a variety of flavors- pineapple, tangerine, cranberry, and a few others. The pineapple was by the far THE BEST. My friends who chose the Bloody Mary bar were very impressed! It was a self serve bar with ENDLESS options of hot sauce, bacon, shrimp, vegetables, and salts to rim the glass. You also get bottomless mimosas included w/ the Bloody Mary bar! There is also a free candy bar full of sweets which was a nice touch. The brunch itself was delicious. We shared a lot of food, we ordered the hash skillet with short rib, the gruyere and truffle mac and cheese, avocado toast, donut plate, oysters, thick cut Canadian bacon, breakfast potatoes, and the sorbet for dessert. All of the food was delicious, my favorite item being the mac & cheese. It is seriously TO DIE FOR. My boyfriend was disappointed with the thick cut Canadian bacon. It was basically just a pork rib slathered in BBQ sauce, he did not finish it and it was $10 for one piece!! We had an amazing time, our waiter was attentive and sweet (we broke a champagne glass) and overall we had an amazing time here. The music was great, the service was great, and most importantly the food was awesome. We will definitely be back!",

After working ten years as a professional chef (CIA graduate), I've come to expect more from a restaurant that wants to command a $75-$100 per person price point. We joined them on a Friday night, the restaurant was very busy and there was only a single hostess greeting and seating parties. It took a very long time to seat our table of six, even though we were on time for our reservation. Management was nowhere to be found. Once at our table the service did improve, but the food was a let down. If you're a steakhouse, especially asking $40-$50 a steak, you better be able to get your temperatures right. Two of our party sent their medium-rare's which were med-well, back. One had to have there's done twice and on the third steak finally got their steak done rare and settled for it. So, out of six, only one in our party had theirs correct, the others, while not sending them back were over cooked. All in all, the meal was a C+. For the price there are better options close by.",

The steak may not have melted in your mouth like brio but all the items on the plate with salmon, gnocchi and butternut squash, complemented and enhanced the taste. The steak wasn't the absolutely best steak but it was a good amount and cooked well. She also had a ginger snap cocktail and creme brulee donuts(I had one!) The donuts were surprisingly amazing. Two of the biggest factors for the five stars is the main dishes do not leave you with a carb overload,  feeling stuffed(like outback), and we brought our 18 month  old daughter with us and they were very accommodating allowing her to also have a good time at dinner.  The staff was very family friendly and along with the ambiance created a very comfortable dinner environment.",

It's decked out in clean white decor and was lively and upbeat on a Friday night. I love steakhouses and this was spot on with a bunch of steak cut choices for me. Caesar salad and the baked potato were also top notch. My new favorite hotspot.",

    "text": "I have been dining, eating, and drinking at this restaurant for three years and I have to say that every year the food continues to get worse.  The only reason that me and my friends continue to come to this restaurant is because of the outstanding and wonderful service that we receive from the bartenders and the servers.  The food quality has become hit or miss.  You never know what type of food quality that you will receive from this restaurant any more.  The servers and bartenders continuously have to make excuses for the poor food preparation in the kitchen.  Th only thing consistent about the food quality is that I know that I or somebody in my party will have to send something back to the kitchen.  For example, I had brussel sprouts last night, and they came out looking like charcoal!  Luckily, the manager quickly and kindly took care of the problem and replaced the brussel sprouts.  Nobody in the kitchen seems to care about the quality of the food that they send out anymore.  Andiron was not like this when I first started visiting it three years ago. Besides the food quality going down hill, the menu selection is stale and the items that have been popular with me and my friends over the years keep getting removed from the menu whenever the restaurant decides to hire a new chef.  We were very disappointed last night when we found out that the chef had removed the grilled octopus from the menu, which was one of the foods that was consistently good. I will continue to visit Andiron mostly for drinks and social situations, but I will no longer recommend this restaurant for business dinners or for out of town clients.  I am taking my business elsewhere and suggest anybody reading this post doing the same until Elizabeth Blau decides improve the quality of her food!o",

The sauce never arrived. The steak came to the table rare and was sent back. Now, most high end steakhouses would cook you a new steak. Nope, they threw it back on the grill and it was still under done. It went back a second time...again...no new steak, just the same one slapped back on the fire after having been cut into twice. You guessed it...now an over done, tasteless hockey puck. NOW they offer a new steak. We declined...enough already.  They did comp the meal and provide a free dessert, but overall a very dissatisfying experience.",

    "text": "Andiron was a huge disappointment for Sunday brunch! I had high expectations because honestly, you can't help to have high expectations when you walk into this sophisticated restaurant and glance at the menu. The prices are on the high side - $20 for a burger?! $8-10 for sides? The food must be amazing, right?  First off, service was horrible. We had at least three different waiters and every time we needed something, we kept looking around for someone because we had no idea who our waiter was. After we were done eating, it took forever to get our check!! We sat at an empty clean table for at least 10 minutes until someone dropped our check to us.   Hubby and I decided to order the short rib hash and the donut plate, which consisted of five different flavor donut holes. I give five stars on presentation for the food and ambiance, but in terms of the taste - bland and mediocre. The worst was the donut plate! It looked so good and when I took one bite from one of the donut holes, it tasted like an old, dry classic donut from the grocery store. I thought it maybe it was just that one donut hole, so I tried another. Same taste - tasted like nothing but blah. Then I tried another one and I took one bite and tasted like the last two so I stopped eating the donuts.   The short rib hash was better than the donut hole as I took more than 3 bites, but it wasn't anything special. My friend ordered the $20 burger and his face said it all - not good. Our bill was $30 for the donuts and hash plate, and definitely not worth it.  We also indulged in the free candy bar in front because it looked so pretty. I took a Cap'n Crunch rice krispy treat, took one bite and threw it away.   I'm sorry, Andiron. I really really wanted to like you and I wouldn't have had any problems paying your prices if the service was exceptional and the food was good - but sadly, they were both misses.",

The restaurant is designed beautifully with great attention to detail matching the menus to the wallpapered accent walls to the waitress' dresses and waiter's ties.   We really like this place, top notch dining with top notch service in a top notch location.  We ate here yesterday for Sunday brunch with a group of friends.  For Sunday brunch there's a live DJ spinning a mix of top 40, house, and pop. Walking in you're greeted with a large complimentary spread of desserts and candies.   We ordered the donut plate to start which is a flight of 6 different seasonal inspired house made filled round donut holes. These were sooo goood! I would order two flights so you can share the goodness of each donut with another at your table.   As a vegetarian I ordered the single vegetarian savory main dish and side options which were the Summerlin Omelette and side of Torchio Mac & Cheese. The mac and cheese was perfectly ooey and gooey and I would not change a thing. It was wonderful. The omelette was perfectly executed but very plain. Served along side breakfast potatoes, filled with a small amount of local vegetables, and topped with loose arugula, given how deliciously creative the chefs are with the rest of the menus (breakfast lunch and dinner included) I thought this plate was commonplace. I'm not as imaginative as the owners but an idea would be to include an acidic house made relish or pico.   We've been here for a holiday lunch and dinner on separate occasions and were very happy with everything that was ordered.",

All the food pairings were well done and the creme brulee donuts are the bomb. I wish all deserts tasted like that. My one frustration was having to pay for the sides separate from the meal. They should just be included. 9/10 would recommend.",

That was pretty awesome. As we sat, we were greeted by some more servers that greeted us with happy anniversary. This was our first time here and we were already pleased by the service. We had the pleasure of having Ricardo as our server and Luis was just as great. Ricardo was very knowledgeable with the menu and gave us his recommendations which did not disappoint. The brussel sprouts are amazing just as he suggested. Our drinks we're definitely worth the price. From the appetizers to the main course everything was delicious. We received complimentary dessert and dessert wine which really completed the evening. We will definitely be returning customers. Thanks to Ricardo and Louis's outstanding service and the amazing food. My husband had the 14 oz New York steak medium with the shrimp. I had the 8 oz filet mignon medium. We also had the brussel sprouts and the lobster mac and cheese. For the appetizer we had the avocado toast and we shared the burrata and prosciutto salad. The garlic tater tots were also good.

    "text": "I've been wanting to go here forever and was finally able to visit on Saturday 3-12-16 at 7:40 PM.  I didn't realize it was in Downtown Summerlin and it's freakin' fancy!  We almost walked out because we felt under-dressed but the hostess assured us there was no dress code. There was a live band playing and the decor is SWANK-Y.    They seem to not be kid-friendly but we called ahead and asked if children were allowed and they said yes.  No high chair or booster seat was offered, nor did they bring any utensils or beverage for the boy.  We got plenty of stares even though he was behaving.  If I had it to do over again, I'd probably not bring the boy and I would have dressed up a bit.    $140.60 got us a shrimp cocktail, scallop entree, wagyu burger, two sides, a cocktail, a caesar salad, and a dessert. Complementary warm bread and soft butter were brought to the table.  They asked if we wanted fizzy or flat water and I said flat so we got charged for an $8 bottle of Fiji water.  Not cool.    $12.00 caesar salad was very tasty, fresh, and undoubtedly had house-made dressing.  Capers were an interesting addition.  I totally recommend this!   $17.00 shrimp cocktail was absolutely gorgeous.  I was so pissed when I got home and looked at my pics and the picture is blurry!!!! GAWD.  The shrimp were huge, succulent, and sweet and the presentation was so fancy.  I loved the horseradish panna cotta balls...so adorable!   $34.00 for five scallops is pretty absurd. They were cooked well and I enjoyed the celery and mushrooms but the scallops themselves were laying on a bed of minty, mushy, peas.  Mint and scallops was an odd combination that I couldn't wrap my brain around.   The mashed potatoes were heavenly....they reminded me so much of my mom's!  Silky, flavorful, absolutely decadent!  The brussel sprouts were equally as tasty and had a lovely, smokey flavor.  $9.00 each but totally worth it, IMO.    The most anticipated dish of the night was the brown butter lemon meringue tart.  The meringue was unlike any I've ever seen or tasted before.  It was incredibly smooth like marshmallow fluff but stiff like a meringue.  I'd be very interested to see their recipe.  The filling of the pie was sweet and tart and lucious but the crust was like a rock.  Seriously I was wishing that they hadn't took my steak knife because that tart needed a chainsaw to cut through it.    Overall the food was very enjoyable and somewhat expensive but the best part about this place is their speed.  The service was impeccable and they were there as soon as we needed them.  When you have a toddler with you, the goal is to get in and out as quick as possible.  They picked up on this without us saying a word and I appreciated it.  Yeah...I'm a fan.",

    "text": "I've been to Andiron about 1/2 dozen times now. Unfortunately I don't believe the quality of the restaurant has maintained its level of excellence any longer. Here is why I just rated it satisfactory now: 1.  The Positive:  Bartender very affable and serves an excellent drink albeit pricey.  Love the large ice ball and extremely kind to give my friend a try of a new liquor before ordering. Atmosphere remains very comfortable and I enjoy dining where you can hear others at your table speak without raising your voice. Service was very good (see below for exception).   2.  The Negative:  As to service I believe our waitress was new and not skilled in steak (clearly should have been). Asked questions about aging and whether bone in or not and it was obvious she made up answers instead of asking someone who knew the answer. They ran out of one type of steak that my friend ordered the waitress should have known that before ordering.  Now the \"meat of the matter\".  The steak wasn't good. I ordered the New York Strip. It cooked correct at medium but was very thin, firm, and tough to eat. This steak was way too thin looked like what I buy at Smiths Grocery.  Costco sells better thicker cuts. My friend ordered the bone in New York (medium rare) and sent it back.  Not eatable.    So I may go back for drinks and happy hour but cutting quality to cut cost will now inspire me to go elsewhere.   Addendum:  Much Credit to management for reaching out to me and expressing concern as to our less than optimal evening.",

We got avocado toast as a starter and that was great. I got the smoked salmon toast and it was good, but not amazing. The other people in my party got banana french toast and the shrimp and grits. I tried some of the French toast and it was incredible. If you like sweet things, this is something you must get. The only thing I would complain about is probably the service. The service was very average.      We asked for an iced tea and they just never came back. I just would expect more from this restaurant. The ambience is really cute. I especially liked the flower wallpaper and accents. I would like to try this place for dinner!",

    "text": "Gorgeous interior with plenty of attention to detail: white woods, open spaces, hammered silver cutlery, and pretty floral bread and dessert plates that matches the wallpaper in the bathroom hallway (so gaudy it's great). I liked how everything came together decoratively, and the service was correspondingly professional and attentive.  Simple but solid steakhouse menu, everything was executed well: standard assortment of apps, selection of steaks and seafood, vegetarian options available. Beef tartare and roasted beet appetizers were predictable and a little underwhelming. Steak and lobster tail special ($65) was good quality with a surprisingly savory house steak sauce. Brussels sprouts and branzino (ask for extra chimmi churri) were typical and the oft-hyped mac and cheese waffle was a fun textural twist on the usual version (make sure you get the cheese sauce!), but the dessert was the surprise highlight: definitely get the peanut butter pretzel cheesecake!   Overall, the food was good but not great. Andiron met my expectations for a good dinner, but knowing that this spot was voted the best new restaurant in Vegas for 2015 (even if it is largely a popularity a contest), I expected to be wowed... but wasn't.  EDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for brunch and service was largely absent. Our trio ordered several dishes to share and most were unremarkable. The shrimp and grits dish I ordered was pretty but barely seemed seasoned and the $10 avocado toast was flat-out boring. The dessert bar was a nice touch, but not enough to justify the prices for the quality put out for paid dishes.",

    "text": "Underwhelmed by my Valentine's Day experience here.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Restaurant was very crowded and it was obvious they had squeezed in extra tables and chairs just for Valentine's Day.  Their normal tables didn't have tablecloths; and the ones they worked in had tablecloths; and we saw staff folding the tables up before we left.  It was hard to walk in between tables and chairs because everything was so close together.  Only a $79 pre-set menu was available; 3 appetizer and entree choices and 2 dessert choices plus an amuse course that menu said was \"lump crab roll\"; waiter delivered something he called a lobster roll.  Um, lobster and crab are 2 different things.  Pretty sure it was lobster.  We both ordered onion soup + surf & turf.  My soup was scorching hot; husband sent his back because it was cold.  He also asked for tea, that was never brought to the table.  I asked for my steak well with no pink; and was given a steak that was perfectly charred on the outside ... and bright pink on the inside.  Wish I had taken a picture.  No idea how they cooked that.    (The table to my right also had something not make it to their table and we got to listen the conversation as the item was removed from the bill.)  After we had our food, the table to my left turned over and the new guy at the table asked the waiter (same waiter we had!) for a normal menu and was told, sorry, our full menu isn't available tonight, but we also have a shrimp cocktail, Caesar salad, a tomahawk rib eye that you can share, branzino, etc etc and then proceeded to detail more items than what was on the pre-set menu, that could be ordered!  WHAT. Our waiter never shared this with us, at all.  I would have LOVED a shrimp cocktail.  My husband absolutely would have ordered the Caesar salad.  Never given the opportunity.  We ordered one each of the desserts and they were were just OK.  Donuts were more like injected donuts holes.  Candy Bar dessert was very similar to a Butterfinger and was very rich; I couldn't finish it.  It also included ice cream, which wasn't on the menu.  Believe it was caramel ice cream but not 100% sure.   I've had better dining experiences here.  Would much rather order off their regular menu next time.  The Valentine's Day menu is still on their website as I write this.  If you come for a special occasion, check their website for special menus and if you see one, I recommend re-thinking and skipping this place for a special occasion.",

The oysters came with 3 sauces (I think horseradish, cocktail, and Tabasco) but unsure what they were bc the guy who served us was quieter than a mouse. We ordered two glasses of wine and it literally took TWENTY MINUTES! Everything was too expensive and they only had like 7 items and steak on the menu. Everything was over $30 for an entree. I had to settle for avocado toast, Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts.   They all tasted good but I was definitely ripped off. Why charge so much for food that wouldn't even be categorized as fine dining?!  I also ordered a earl grey mixed cocktail and it sucked. No alcohol and all juice/tea. Worst service I've ever endured in a pricy/\"upscale\" restaurant. It was empty tonight so that pretty much speaks for itself.",

A few of us ordered bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's. We each also ordered our own brunch selections. Food was delicious, no complaints there. Drinks as well.  The problem was after we received our check and everyone contributed their share of the bill in cash with tip included. We all thought we left a sufficient amount, however, after the waitress closed out our bill, she had the audacity to come back and ask if the service was bad and implied we didn't leave enough of a tip, as after she split with everyone else, would barely leave her anything. How is that it our problem? Is it MANDATORY that you leave a 20% tip? Our party was insulted! My son, annoyed, gave her another $20 (which I don't think he should've done). Thereafter, my son & husband went to speak to the general manager about the waitress' conduct as this has NEVER happened before....in ANY restaurant we've been to. Their staff needs to be properly trained as I don't want this to happen to anyone else.",

We heard great things about this restaurant and the pictures looked phenomenal so we decided to try since we love Downtown Summerlin. The restaurant was so nice and I absolutely love how it was decorated and how the servers were attired. The servers were very friendly, but not super knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the moscow mule which was very good and I liked the introduction to the apple slices to the drink. Bread service came which I did not eat (passover), but other people ate it and said it was amazing. I ordered the shaved vegetable salad as my first course and it was the best item I had of the night. The cashew dressing was a perfect complement to the vegetables.  I ordered the filet with shrimp for my entree and it tasted good, but we had just gone to John Cutter and my steak was better there and for a quarter of the price. There was nothing wrong with the steak, I have just had better steak at a better value. The shrimp were tasty and seasoned well. I also liked the steak sauce that accompanied the steak.  For our sides we ordered creamed spinach, fries and a pasta type side that I did not try. The spinach was below average and was hardly creamy or cheesy. The fries were fine, but they were fries so....but they gave us an aioli ketchup that was yummy. Overall, its definitely a place to try, but not sure if I will go back. There are some interesting items on the menu that I may go back to try if I am accompanied by interesting eaters like myself, such as the bacon mazzo balls and mac n cheese waffle.",

No Wait, Great Service Food was beyond all expectations - they are smaller in portions - when I order scallops I think of Hells Kitchen scallops, large 2-3' in diameter, the ones we were served were like 1\" in diameter baby scallops but the flavor and prep work was top notch. The Rib Cap and Bone in was amazing of course we had to add the Lobster tail for a mere $28! A scream of a deal it was the perfect size! The course melted in our mouths, grilled asparagus, was perfection and the sauces were succulent and complimentary.  The ambiance of Andiron Steak and Sea reminded me of Laguna beach and Tommy Bahamas mashed up. Beautiful simple, contemporary practical decor, comfortable lounge seating great open windowed kitchen and bar - This is a huge hit - Hard to beat HoneySalt, but each restaurant Elizabeth is a part of will be a roaring success - cannot wait to come back.  We reserved online and they even prepared a special dessert for our special occasion. For a Vegas local - this is class act touch all the way!!

The service, who I just recently had Vinny as our server, is the best. They let you DINE here, allow you to drink your cocktail and eat your app before rushing you into the next course. And the best of all is that they do not clear the table until all are finished with the course, that's such a great and professional touch to me. The Sommeliers are wonderful because if they don't have the bottle of wine you ordered, they immediately bring you comparable bottles but allow you to keep the same price as the bottle before. Just a classy place, it's my special occasion restaurant for every season. Thank you for always being so kind to us, Andiron!!",

The steaks were just bad. With all the wonderful steak places nearby (Echo and Rig, Charcoal Room, T-Bones) I just don't know why anyone would go here.",

Can wholeheartedly recommend the lamb chops and skirt steak. Also had the Buratta and grilled veg salad.  Definitely return on next visit.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying to all of you who gave this joke of a restaurant a 3 or more stars, you must be crazy, a friend of the workers, or just flat out don't know food!!!  I went for my birthday, in April and it was one of the most disappointing and inedible meals to date,(Almost as bad as chef Ramsey's steak, at the Paris). It was even louder then Steak too that's another story, and I thought I would never say this, but if you can't hear the people you're with it becomes very unpleasant. Also remember this if you get seated next to service table ask to be moved. They'll bump you, run in to you and not say anything. No excuse me, I'm sorry, nothing. We wouldn't have heard them anyhow. We were right next to them and they still wouldn't fill our empty glasses of wine, as I noticed them doing for others. It must have been because we brought our own wine that we like and they don't have. We like to hoard our wine for years, it just taste better.    Know lets talk about the food.  The only reason I went here was for the Hudson valley foie gras and they didn't serve it at all. I'm sorry if you want to be a high end restaurant like they are trying so hard to be you need to keep up with your menu, online and at site. When you decide to change something, you should be ready for the change in all areas. With that said we order. I ordered the tuna tartare, it was slapped together with cut up dry globes of tuna on top of a salty smashed tater tot. It must have been a special, not so. My wife's and In Laws somehow burnt but ice cold crab cake was very forgettable. So was the rest of their meal, like their burnt steaks. Steakhouse?  Out of the four of us the only half descent plate ordered was my wife's burger with salty tots and a cup of ketchup that had a thick hard crusty glaze over it. Ketchup brulee maybe? It must have been siting in that cup all day. LAZY!!!     I just don't get it!!!",

The decor feels modern and classy! The large dining room with a view into the kitchen is vibrant and has a welcoming feel.  A separate bar and outdoor dining add to the ambiance.    We had two servers Jacob and Ryan who were very attentive but not intrusive.  The meal was perfectly  paced.  Best of all  the food was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. We had the oysters to start then steak.  We also loved the mac n cheese waffle and we ordered the sampler of sauces, the leeks and mushrooms.  Everything was delicious.  As were the lemon meringue pie and the cheesecake.  A great addition for Summerlin.  Our new favorite place to dine!",

However, Andiron was selected by my wife because its her birthday and we had a wonderful experience previously.  The hostess checked us in promptly and seated us at a centrally located table. The dining room decor is beautiful and has remained unchanged. Our server Ricki and his associates provided us with excellent service throughout the evening. The three course selection from the restaurant week menu was inviting and did not disappoint. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was served with a horseradish panna cotta and a cocktail sauce on the side. When mixed together the flavor was tangy and tasty. The entree consisted of Scottish Salmon with a Serrano ham crust along with artichokes, cipollini onions and a Peruvian chili sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the Serrano ham provided a nice crunch. Desert was an Apple Tarte Tatin with sweet cider and vanilla ice cream. The desert was decadent. My wife selected the Strauss Grass Fed 8 oz filet of beef which was cooked exactly as requested. An Idaho baked potato was large enough to share and various toppings were available.  When making the reservation, I specified the special event that was being celebrated. The disappointment was that neither the hostess or the wait staff acknowledged the event. Indeed very disappointing. Not paying attention to this detail is the reason why five stars was not awarded.",

Here is my lowdown:  Service - On point and everything seemed natural to them.  All staff that interacted with us was warm and friendly.  Both managers (lady and a gentleman) were also very nice.  Food: 9oz Grass-fed Filet - Perfect temperature, unfortunately little or no seasoning.  I topped it with the Foie Gras add on!  Awesome.  Paired the bearnaise  with it.  It was a bit loose for my taste..perhaps it was thinned out with water..?  Also ordered the asparagus which was cooked perfectly and twice baked potato which was delicious.  My in laws and wife had the Wagyu burger, Farro Rissotto, and Foie Gras appetizer.  Everyone loved their dishes with the exception of the Risotto which was not their fault as the guest in my party read the menu wrong.  We all shared the chocolate dessert option and were very pleased.  Overall its a very classy place with great service and solid food.  Unfortunately for me the prices are way too expensive for being an off the strip restaurant.  You could easily spend $100+ per person here if your not careful.",

Then I called back to let them know that I was having flowers delivered and if they could be on our table when we arrived. Elizabeth said she noticed that it was a Birthday and if we would like a special desert, I said yes and we picked one. When we arrived, we were seated at a table ( and not a good one at that) but no flowers. I looked around and saw the flowers on another guests table! I mentioned to our waiter that our flowers were missing. Saw him speaking with a manager and then the flowers appeared. No apologies to me what so ever. The Service was so-so. At one point Elizabeth did come by and say Happy Birthday, but it would have been lovely if she would have introduced herself to us. We finished our meal and guess what... No special birthday desert! Maybe the people at the other table where we were supposed to be seated where the flowers originally were, received my mothers birthday desert. Very disappointed",

It was my finances birthday so I had a custom cake made which I delivered to them before the reservation and they informed me they have a \"cake slicing fee of $4 per slice.\" Really? You're going to charge me $4 per slice? Thank god it was just me and him. It wasn't too busy of a night but there was one big party going on, 15+ people. I loved the vibe inside so I was really hoping this could be our new spot. We ordered the Mac and Cheese Waffle which was super delicious! So glad we tried it out. We both ordered steak though and unfortunately we requested medium well and both received medium. VERY pink. Once we got our waiter we requested for them to cook them a tad bit more for us. Once brought back out mine was closer to being medium well, while my fiances was still as pink as before and only burnt more so on the outside. We picked at it some more and decide to give up. We again let the waiters know the situation an they were apologetic but I did see a manager on the floor they spoke to and neither did she or the chef come to our table. When bringing out my fiances cake they did not have the candles lit which was a tad annoying. Overall, the Mac and Cheese Waffle was the highlight of the night. Not a fan of the chef whatsoever. Waiters were kind but the least they could do was have a manger brought over. Oh, but they did drop my $4 cake slicing fee for our troubles. (Insert eye roll)",

Carrot soup was bland and the steaks were average. What really made the for an awful experience was the service. The waiter did not notice we were out of our wine by the glass despite walking right by the table twice. We both ordered steak (rib cap and ribeye) and were not asked what sauce we wanted, just brought the steak sauce. Took a long time to get our food,  both appitizers and entree, though the restaurant was not particularly busy. Manager did not seem to be on the floor at all.  Great service might have saved the night. Busboy was the only one putting in the effort. $174 for 2 (before tip) and not nearly worth it. We won't go back. Husband is in the business and we dine out a lot. Sad because it's very close to our house and we like to support neighborhood businesses. Will stick to Echo & Rig.",

The Chef never came to our table, nor a manager.  The nasty oyster sat on our table for another 10 minutes.  The server should have said, \"I'm so sorry.  Let me take that away for you.\"  Server seemed clueless.  He then, offered to \"replace the Oyster\" with a new one.  Unfortunately, at this point, I lost my craving for oysters.  Everything else went wrong.  When the entrees arrived, the table was still full of dirty plates.  Our server never removed the appetizer plates.  We had a shrimp cocktail too.  It was mediocre at best.  Served at room temperature.  Yuck.  Not sure why the server was in such a hurry to bring out the entrees.  He could have at least cleared the appetizer plates and brought us steak knives first.  This is supposed to be fine dining? Steaks were overcooked.  Spinach had no flavor.

Knowing that we were aware of what we were wanting to spend, the waiter kept recommending stuff but failed to mention the increase in price.  For example, he asked if we wanted bleu cheese crumbles on our steaks.  We all agreed, but he did not mention an upcharge.  When he suggested we get the steaks that are bone in, he did not mention the $16 price increase per steak.  When the bill came to us we were very surprised.  We dine out frequently but would not go here again.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is courteous.  With the waiter knowing our concerns, he should have mentioned the upcharges for absolutely everything.  For a table for three, we spent $340.",

We enjoyed the Charcuterie & Cheese plate and house made potato chips.  However, what made this evening  so outstanding was Robert, the bartender.  From giving us honest expert opinion on food choices, to assisting with drink options, he was spot on. He was funny, interesting, and made our evening at Andiron a great experience!  we will be back just to hang out and talk with him.",

    "text": "Disappointing.  Sunday brunch. Place looks nice. Presentation was nice but food just ok for the high prices and service was lacking.  They put us, a party of 6, at a table meant for 4, even though there were tables of 6 available.  When I flagged down a manager-looking person and told him we wanted to move, he said I was lucky I asked him ( I guess instead of someone else who would have made us sit where we were?).  They are understaffed with waiters. When our (head?) waiter finally came, he introduced himself and said he'd be serving us with a team to make sure all our experience was excellent.  No one else introduced themselves and we just wound up having to flag employees down as they whizzed by on their way somewhere else. If I managed a restaurant that was understaffed, I'd roll up my sleeves and help wait and bus tables.  However, the managers did LOOK nice I their spiffy suits.... (One other note--Our bill was a few hundred dollars.   Two of us split an entree. Instead of splitting it in the kitchen, they brought an extra plate for us to do it ourselves.  That's cool,  but restaurants in the category they are trying to be, should take care of it for the customer.)",

    "text": "Went on Father's Day, place was not crowded, many unoccupied tables, so we don't know why the bad service. We asked for an appetizer and it never came, we asked for coffee and it never came. What did arrive was a bad ribeye that was so tough I couldn't cut it, thought at first it was a dull knife problem, but after getting a second knife, same thing. And what I also got was what looked to me like hair, but the waiter took it away and then came back stating it was \"corn silk\" and I can tell the difference between hair and corn silk, but okay. The dinner was supposed to come with mashed potatoes but what really comes on the plate is a drizzle of liquid potato that looks like a sauce underneath the broccolini and steak, and I thought it was horseradish sauce, but it actually was their idea of mashed potatoes. The waiter told us he didn't think the Sunday ribeye dinner comes with mashed potatoes, but after he went to check the menu he stated I was correct and did apologize and brought me a small side of mashed potatoes. Someone in a suit came over to our table shortly after that and apologized for something, not sure if it was the hair in the food, the fact we didn't get the appetizer, or the lack of mashed potatoes, but he said sorry and that he would make it right. I don't know what that meant since bad service continued after his statement. The waiter told us we could order anything from the bar, they had everything, so I ordered a passion fruit martini, which they didn't have the ingredients for that but the bartender improvised and made some delicious fruity drink. When I ordered a second one, it was totally different than the first, different color and it didn't taste half as good as the first one. By this point we were disgusted with this place, hence this review. Please get your act together here. We doubt we will return.",

    "text": "We came in high spirits thinking we were celebrating a birthday.  Early on our \"birthday girl\" announced that she and her significant other were getting married in Dec.  We were so happy for them.  We had arrived around 6:30.  At 7: 40 we had been served 6 pieces of cornbread. (We were 3 couples.) We asked for our server.  She went to check on our order.  She came back a while later to say \"it's coming\".  We then asked for the manager  who went to check.  We saw a discussion in the kitchen between the manager, the server, and kitchen employees. It was a no brainer that our order had not been submitted to the kitchen.  No one admitted to this and no one really seemed to care.  We received our soups and salads about 15 minutes later followed by our entrees. 4 of us had ordered steaks medium rare. Three were over done and one was very  rare. We did not complain or send them back because we just wanted to eat and get out of there.  We ordered desserts.  An asst. waiter brought over six glasses of sparkling wine (on the house).  3 of us do not drink. Our server brought the bill and was pleased to announce that she had taken off the wine that only 3 people had at the beginning of the meal.  We were then served one chocolate chip cookie cut into 6 pieces. Our spirits were not spoiled for our friends, the squash soup was good and the doughnuts were excellent.  We will not be returning.",

I wish that I could have given this place a higher marking, but for what I paid for and what I received, I could have stayed home.  The only thing that saved this review was their unlimited mimosas, which we ended up making our own signature drink that turned out to be very delicious.  The service was okay.  During my visit, I ordered the lobster rolls, which were two small rolls, that contained warm lobster meat and a side of chips.  Nothing much to write about.  I definitely felt that the menu was missing a few brunch staples that you would find on about every brunch menu.",

A month or so ago, we bid on a prize through Nevada Public Radio; however, did not win.  As a consolation prize, we received a $25 off coupon from this restaurant.   I am so glad that we did.  Without that coupon, I would likely have not come across this beautiful gem.  We arrived on Sunday, August 19th at about 11:45AM and we got seated promptly at a table for two.  The restaurant appeared to be near capacity.    We had a very friendly server (although I do not recall his name).  The name on the receipt is Ace.  The restaurant is beautiful. The seats are upholstered in this beautiful light green fabric, which compliments the contemporary yet rustic look of this establishment.     The food was absolutely amazing!   I had the Shrimp and Grits, which was a generous portion.  It was garnished with bacon and this delicious jalapeno creme fraise.  My partner had the Brisket Breakfast Bowl, which was equally as delicious.  We shared the Mac N Cheese on the side.    Everything we had was above and beyond our expectations.  We cannot wait to come back the next time we are in town.  We also understand that there is another restaurant that is owned by the fine folks who own this establishment.     One of the two owners was actually present at the restaurant today, and was occasionally walking around making sure everything was great for her guests.  That was fabulous.  We personally stopped by and said thank you as we were leaving.",

You get 3 bite size tuna cones for $9.  That would be more than full price at any sushi bar in town.    We asked how many tacos were in a serving, and our server said 3.  3 salmon tacos for $8 seems reasonable for happy hour... but not when they are tiny bite size portions.",

I was shocked as all the chef had to to do was check it and know it was still medium RARE.... was very upset and didnt bother to drive the steak all the way back to have it fixed.

    "text": "Andiron has been the place I've been wanting to try for awhile now. I heard they had a happy hour, so I decided to try it with my family. They open at 4pm, we arrived around 4:15. They only have the happy hour menu available, but the full menu isn't available till 5pm. The menu is very small, and they're considered to be bite size appetizers, hence the price point.   We ordered the poke, bao, shrimp cocktail, truffle fries, and steak tartare. Also, we ended up checking-in and getting a free dessert. The creme brulee donuts, with a scoop of banana caramel definitely hits the spot.   I would say if you're hungry, order multiple plates. But honestly, I would rather try the full menu next time.  Overall, great customer service and atmosphere.",

The food is nothing to rave about, and certainly not worth the price for the portion sizes. I understand when a menu says 6oz steak, and you get a 6oz steak, but I'm expecting more than one 2inch potato cut in half, topped with a disappointing garnish. We asked for a couple sides if bread as the service was relatively slow, and we received a plate with 3 rolls at a 4 person table. CHEAP  I get you have to make a profit, but this isn't stocks. You have to give a good product that fosters a constant profit stream.",

    "text": "We have been meaning to come here since it opened as we live a five minute walk away.   We came Saturday night for happy first with group of ten of us.   Restaurant was nice inside and our server was very good.   Happy hour prices are good and the drinks were fine.   Our issue was with the food. It honestly was not good. We had oysters which were the best thing we had. Fresh and good.   We had also ordered the loaded tater tots along with the shrimp. They were ok nothing great but not bad. The big issue was with the dinner menu items we ordered. My wife got the burger which came out almost raw and had so much extras on it it was just a pile of mush. My wife just lost her appetite and did not want to send it back. I ordered the beef tartar and it's one of my favorite dishes. It was almost inedible. It was very thickly cut without any real seasoning so it seemed like i was biting into a raw steak.   Not very appetizing at all.   It just seemed there was not any real quality control with the items we ordered and the restaurant was not busy. Maybe the heavy rain and cold night had something to do with this but something was seriously missing in the quality control department.   There are many other great places to eat locally and honestly there is no reason to come back for below average food.   Again the server was nice and the decor is nice but that's it. We were very disappointed.",

It just tasted like there was no seasoning. A shame because they sure are pretty. You know it's bland when the caesar salad is the most flavorful dish (thanks to the peppercorns). The octopus, fried chicken bao, burrata were prepared great but no taste whatsoever. We decided to skip dessert because we figured it would be the same.   The decor is stunning. The service is wonderful. Servers, bussers, hostess couldn't be better trained. Pricey but they have good specials running. With such romantic lighting, you'd think they'd play more ambient music but they ruin it with Nicki Minaj and loud EDM. I bet they would sell a lot more bottles of wine if they found a lounge playlist instead.",

I just wanted to order everything!  I finally decided on the lobster roll and creme brulee French toast. My husband ordered the short rib hash. I did order a drink but it was a part of the brunch menu and you can order it bottomless. The drink was super strong so if you aren't a heavy drinker like me, this drink will knock you out but I shared it with my husband luckily. The lobster roll came out first and it was good but filled with lots of onions (yuck) and celery so that wasn't my favorite. The creme brulee French toast wasn't overly sweet at all and I didn't need syrup. It was on thick bread so it didn't get soggy which is how French toast should be anyways! I highly enjoyed it. I tried a bit of my husband short rib hash and it was great minus the spicy part for me.   Overall, I thought it was wonderful and they have this room that you can hold events in. I would definitely come back for brunch or dinner! Service was great!",

    "text": "The first time I came here was with my girlfriend about a year ago. We fell in love with the oysters and had a good experience overall.  The second time I came here was when my parents were in town back in November of 2017. The customer service was sub-par. This was a celebratory dinner and I recommended Andiron to my parents. After being seated, our order was not taken for approximately 30-45 minutes. Our cocktails were not refilled. After ordering, we did not receive our food for about an hour. There were people that arrived after us, finishing their meals and leaving before we even had our food. As repayment, the waitress gave us 3 tiny free donuts...  The third time I came here was for Valentine's Day with my better half. The waiter seems pretty uninterested in us. I figured it was because he was probably dealing with insanity all day for the occasion. After receiving our food, my girlfriend and I cut into our steaks only to see that they were rare. However, we both asked for \"medium.\" They took our steaks away and brought them back. After cutting into them, the steaks were still rare.. The manager came over and gave us a free glass of wine as well as a free desert option as we waited for our steaks to arrive. This was a nice gesture that we appreciated. Finally, our steaks arrived the third time and after cutting into them, they were still very rare. The waiter and the manager agreed, so I knew we weren't over exaggerating. Ultimately, they comped about half of the bill, which was nice.  After a few months of avoiding the restaurant like the plague, I decided it was time to give Andiron one last shot. My Girlfriend was hesitant, but I told her they oysters would be worth it and that I had a good feeling about it. After arriving, we were sat outside and started off with some oysters. Funny enough, we had the same waiter as our Valentine's day meal. No hard feelings. I ordered the 14oz. New York Strip and mashed potatoes and my girlfriend ordered the 8oz. Skirt Steak. and mac and cheese. When our steaks arrived, we both cut into them to ensure that they were cooked medium. My girlfriend's was cooked medium and mine seemed to be close to medium near the end of the steak (I should have cut in the middle.. I blame the gin and tonics). After a few bites of my steak, I realized that it was not warm anymore and that it was closer to medium rare. For some reason. I get freaked out with anything under medium. I politely spoke to my waiter about the issue and he said that he remembered us and that he would talk to the manager. I then asked to speak to the manager so I could bring these instances to his/her attention.   It seemed that either 1) our perception of \"medium\" and the restaurant's perception is different or 2) the chef(s) can't get it right. I shared my experiences with the manger, who stated that she was new, and she seemed receptive. However, she didn't seem troubled. I don't know about you, but if I had a customer that has had 3 really bad experiences in a row, at my steakhouse restaurant, I would be genuinely concerned and upset. Either way, she left and said she would speak with the chef. The waiter returned and said he would get us a free desert. I asked to be comped for the steak instead. He came back with our drinks comped and I leveled with him. The drinks were fine, the service was fine, the apps were solid, but the steak was not. So, I asked if I could have my steak comped. He seemed hesitant, but came back with the check and said the steak was comped.  Unfortunately, we will not be back to Andiron. I have never experienced any cooking issues like this at any other restaurant. Especially not at any other local steakhouses (Echo and Rig, Herbs and Rye, etc). I would recommend avoiding Andiron as it is not worth the risk and trouble. Thank you for reading through my novel. I feel that it's important to share these experiences with you all.",

I know my answer to that question, or, it's VERY possible I am just coming up with excuses to return to Andiron. From the moment I arrived with fellow Elite Jessie B. and my 13 year old daughter, we were impressed.  Starting with service, to decor, to the food, I was overwhelmed and amazed.  Knowing this was the sister restaurant to Honey Salt, my bar was immediately set high. I really wanted to try every single thing on the menu. Between us, we went with a donuts sampler, the eggs benedict, the cranberry brie grilled cheese sandwich, the maple/lemon infused french toast, a side of sausage (made in house) the bloody mary bar, and our waiter Luis was kind enough to recommend  the most delicious, melt in your mouth, peanut butter cheesecake dessert that has ever existed! I promise, I would go back for that alone! Honestly, I couldn't only go back for that, when everything was truly remarkable. When the told us the maple syrup was infused into the french toast, I thought to myself, NO way. I figured it would still need additional syrup. I was SO wrong! The chefs here really put thought into every step of these dishes.  The bloody mary bar was also unique. You had a bartender to give you your choice of vodka, from regular, citron, or peppar. They also had 4 mixes to choose from including a green one, and a spicy. So many options from multiple salt toppers like celery, lime, or Old Bay. Then things like greek olives, blue cheese stuffed olives, shrimp, bacon, and jerky! I was tempted to just stay there, all morning, and afternoon! From start to finish, this place won me over. I have a feeling Andiron will be seeing much more of me, and I am looking forward to it.",

Then after sitting for a bit she took our order we finished the appetizers  and they sat no one checked on us for drinks water or cocktails. Another server came to clear the dishes we stacked to the side and asked us if we'd like drinks. Drinks sat at bar  waiting for waitress to pick up. Server brought food out she checked on the food. We had to ask for food to be bagged and check. Not even busy there was staff everywhere standing around and even a women who appeared to maybe be the manager on shift. Would say there are better places in the area that pay attention to customer care and are attentive. The only ones hustling were the hostesses seating, serving drinks and helping at the bar. Service could be a reason they were not that busy.",

One strange thing before we even got there, you had to pay in advance for your ticket ($95.. ok, fine) AND 20% gratuity before the service even took place for a table of two. We had high expectations since they were doing this, and it ended up being a huge bust of a NYE dinner.   We selected 9:00pm and were there right on time. One of us is a vegetarian and knowing what they put out for their tasting in advance, you still needed to remove some pieces of the dish to accommodate which is fine. Always better when restaurants accommodate a vegetarian option out the door when charging so much, but no issues. Since removing the meat in one of the appetizers, it was quite boring and plain. Crab appetizer was good, a bit bland. The main issue was the entree. Roasted Mushroom Risotto with Truffle. Sounds amazing, but was so under-seasoned we couldn't believe it. We asked for salt and it helped a little, but not much. We didn't see any mushrooms in the \"Mushroom Risotto\" so we called the waiter over assuming the kitchen made a mistake. We were then informed that the mushrooms were pureed and in the sauce. It was basically a big bowl of rice and cheese, with no mushroom or truffle taste (despite a few shavings of truffle on the top). They could have hit it with a tiny bit of truffle oil and it would have made that flavor come out no question. $95 for a burrata appetizer, cheesy risotto with no mushrooms and three donuts.   The way they promoted the night was a DJ and dance floor and tons of fun. The gentleman at the front with a laptop playing music was ok, but it sounded like any other restaurant music through a typical music station. We ended up getting our deserts to go and were out the door well before their champagne toast.   We wouldn't return based off the flavor profile and we definitely feel ripped off for this dinner with the courses that were served.",

    "text": "This place has quickly become one of our favorite dining spots in Las Vegas.  Each time we have been here, the service and food has been spot on.  My wife and I made last-minute reservations for an early evening dinner and, once again, Andiron did not disappoint.    Highlights:  - Perfect Sapphire martini, up with blue cheese olives and made exactly the way I like it.  My wife had a nice rose.  - Opened with the steak tartare and grilled octopus.  Both solid dishes and that steak tartare - holy hell yes.  - Added half dozen raw oysters. Forgot the type but super fresh, briny, and plump.  Love the mignonette they serve them with.  Usually love the old-fashioned cocktail sauce/horseradish combo but I am becoming a fan of this sauce.  Perfect acidity to balance with the oyster.  - Double pork chop special for myself.  Couldn't have been cooked more perfectly than it was: a nice medium resulting in moist and tender bites.  Sweet Mother of God it was huge too.  - My wife had the surf and turf - perfectly sized ribeye and three huge prawns served scampi-style.  She enjoyed it immensely.  - We split an order of their delicious take on mac-n-cheese.  - No dessert this time cause we were about to burst at the seams.  And there you have it.  What used to be a place we only went for special occasions is now a part of our standard rotation of dining establishments in this city.  The staff are really friendly, the drinks are well-made, and the food is brilliant.  Can't wait for the next time already!",

On hindsight we would have started in the bar area as it was happy hour and drinks are pricey in the dining room. But we didn't think of that when planning our evening. Since we were heading out for a concert after, we saved drinks for later and ordered dinner only. We had a very attentive waitstaff. The bread basket was excellent and hard to resist. I ordered branzino fish and the hubby ordered short ribs. Substitutions were not allowed so this was my second choice. While I appreciate the chef for not wishing to change the menu, I have not encountered this rigidity lately. My fish was very fresh and mildly seasoned. The short ribs were extremely flavorful. We used the Yelp check in free dessert deal and were allowed to select anything from the dessert menu. Since we had already enjoyed the famous creme brulee donut, we ordered a banana cream tres leches cake instead. It was good, but the donut is more memorable. We will try happy hour next time.",

    "text": "I'm finally getting around to posting a review for Andiron. I made a couple visits during the summer and with the executive chef changes (opening chef Joe Zanelli left, Brett Uniss entered and soon departed, and now Micah Waltz leads the kitchen) some dishes I tried are no longer served. Their menu had a mix of traditional steakhouse fare like a steak tartare full of capers, bonded with mustard, and topped with an egg and more modern items such as an artfully plated, refreshingly light yellowtail crudo with preserved kumquats. The burrata and grilled fig made for a decent appetizer too, with the creaminess of the cheese, sweetness of the figs and acidity of tomatoes melding beautifully.  Steaks are as good as you'll find off the Strip. The Creekstone Farms bone in rib eye was nicely charred. It's dark exterior glistening with butter and topped with mushrooms. Simply plated on a white dish with a small side of house made steak sauce with notes of tang and spice. It was a good sauce but not needed. The Strauss grass fed filet was just as good. Cooked to a medium rare as ordered and very tender and lean. I didn't care of the peppers on top of the peppercorn sauce. Again, the steak was good enough to eat without it. The addition of Alaskan king crabs came out to about 2.5 legs worth of crustacean.  Side dishes were a mixed bag. Creamed spinach was too soupy for my liking, while the creamy and rich risotto with white truffles was excellent.  Ending the meals were two desserts. The first was a warm pecan carrot cake, similar to a muffin topped with candied carrot, sitting in a pool of bourbon cream cheese with pineapple currant  compote running alongside it. It was a solid rendition, but light on the spice and carrots of a traditional carrot cake. The second dessert was a disappointing warm chocolate pudding cake that was too dense and thick.  Everything about this restaurant is well calculated -- from the dishes on the menu to the floral pattern found throughout. While the execution isn't always perfect, the net result is one of the better steakhouses found off the Strip.",

The mashed potatoes were the creamiest we had. Also, Ryan was kind enough for us to taste three different red wines to make sure we picked the right one for our meal. The way they made and seasoned their cauliflower was awesome as well. Over time the place got packed. Great place to have a very nice meal out for 2.",

They have a DJ spinning loungy tunes. To finish the experience, you can grab coco puff treat on your way out. The service was exceptional as well. I already have a reservation for my next visit.",

    "text": "Went tonight for our Valentine's Day dinner.  When my husband made the reservation he was told they had a preset menu but could order off the regular menu as well. Not the case.  Preset menu price $70.00 per person. The Kumiai oyster was too salty and nasty.  They forgot to bring us bread so we had to eat the chocolate kisses they had on the table for decoration to get rid of the taste in our mouth.  He had the pear and endive salad. I had the ahi tuna tartare.  Both good. He had the potato gnocchi and might I mention a very, very small portion. I had the surf (filet) and turf (lobster tail) which menu said came with asparagus and potato gratin.  No asparagus on plate, potato gratin was a two inch square and the lobster tail was cold and had a weird taste.  Still tasting it as I write my review.  His meal of just potato gnocchi was the same price as my surf and turf??! The only other entree choice was pan roasted striped bass.  The couple next to us ordered that and it was a good sized portion.  You've got this nice expensive restaurant and you sit practically on top of each other.  I could literally hear the couple next to us conversation. Dessert was decent. We had been wanting to try this place for a long time and were so disappointed.",

    "text": "We have been really looking forward to coming here and have been excited about the Mac n cheese waffle. So from the start we were a party of 5 with 2 kids in our party. When we were seated first off it was a table that could fit 10 people which was very awkward our reso was put in 3 hours prior so their was plenty of time to Prep a good table that would work for that size of our party on a Tuesday night(6/7/16). We came for the restaurant week prefix menu. To start off we ordered regular water I requested lemons for my water. These were not even brought till I was staring at one of the managers and he asked how everything was going and I asked for some lemons if he could because we saw our actual server a total of 3 times throughout the whole dining experience server was Jennifer. My wife and mother in law came in planning on ordering the mushroom pasta which, was on the restaurant week menu online. This should have been honored or something comparable rather than the excuse of we don't have that product so we can't make it. She responded this way without asking any Manager or Chef which, in every steakhouse and club I've ever managed would've been unacceptable if my staff did that. Next was the kids menu which, it states that the drink and desert were included with the meal. I did not know this which I was the one who paid but, my wife had went through the menu with our son. He had 2 drinks and we were charged for both of them. To me it's not about the dollar amount it's the principal and inconsistency of this restaurant. I haven't even touched on the fact that I ordered the Rib eye prefix meal which, I asked to be prepped at medium temp due to knowing rib eye is a fattier meat and you want that fat to liquify. Well it was medium-rare and very fatty. My sons kids meal which, the server said \"the burger would be cooked well done would that be okay\" I said of course yes please because it's a burger. Well the burger arrived 10 minutes before our food which is not an issue but, the burgers temp was a rare temperature no where near a well done temp. For the burger being $21 it should've been the best cooked burger ever to hit a grill. This place is far from the level they should be at. I think the owners and management need to focus more on the customer experience and good quality because it fell very short. I am seeing a major pattern between this restaurant and Honey Salt which, we went to about a month ago and I tipped the server assistant directly due to her busting her tale and the server just had a bad attitude and spent more time with one table with one touch than she did through our entire dinner. You need to get someone in these restaurants who knows how to train and knows how to serve themselves because these 2 restaurants have managers more concerned about the color of their tie rather than what's going on with the customer experience. To improve the customer experience it's not just asking every table how is everything because, you will get the same answer from every table especially when you can hear what the manager asked the table next to us(This is how Red Lobster trains FOH managers). It doesn't create a unique way to truly get proactive guest responses nor does it make the restaurant goer feel special. I feel these restaurants are lacking this key piece in the niche market they are in. It seemed like such a burden on the managers at both of these restaurants. Obviously me writing this long review was probably a big waste of time but, I want local restaurants to succeed not fail or continue to make the same mistakes. My final grade for now \"Needs major improvement\". The 2 stars are for location and the interior of the restaurant. The experience needs to be revamped from walking in to restaurant to leaving the restaurant which, can be fixed easily you just need the whole team to buy into this philosophy. Good luck and hope to see/hear major improvements in the near future.",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Andiron Steak & Sea. This review is long over due. I have made a resolution that I will post my reviews in an appropriate time so I will not forget too much of the experience. We made reservations for what has become a monthly spend more than normal dinner adventure. I have seen so many good stories and reviews that we had to go here. Plus it was my turn  to choose. I like the vibe you get as you enter, greeted and promptly sat when full party arrived. I had got a drink at bar  before our party arrived and I liked the friendliness of the bartender and how quickly I was greeted with how busy the bar was.  I dob't usually mention the decor(I am more about food and service). I enjoyed the soft white linens and green accents made it really feel like I was being taken on a food experience. We as a group tend to sample each others meal so as to get a full example of the menu. I had The Branzino, I have always wanted to try one and this was my very first experience (nothing to compare it to...yet). This was very good. Had a chmichuri sauce and was stuffed with meat from the fish. Pretty amazing fish dish. I like to try new things and was not disappointed. Others in our group had Mac-n-cheese, mac-n-cheese waffle, polenta (really flavorful) the Strip, Rib Eye Cap. Desert was pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla and salted caramel ice cream. Price was reasonable for 7 of us.  Since I like service, I need to get better at writing down names when my servers are above excellent. I wish I remembered her name. She was a little older lady with a small accent. She was very entertaining and was great at recommending food and rink. We brought our own wine and paid a small corkage fee. We really had a dining experience and it was in thanks to the great service provided. We had a view of the kitchen and it is fun to see how things get expedited in a well run galley.  There were some off notes with some of the food but overall it was a great night(experience). We never felt rushed and were allowed to enjoy our meal. This is a little out of my way so I can see going there if I was in area and wanted a strong steak meal while in downtown summerlin.  If you want a good steak meal at a good price with excellent service you need to try Andiron. You will not be disappointed.",

The appetizer and side orders were awesome also. Our steaks were just not good. We had a 12oz rib eye med rare and a filet cooked med. They were cooked perfectly, they just taste like cheap meat. I always kind of benchmark my steak by what's left on the plate, usually a lot of juice/blood. My plate was totally dry after, which was wierd just because the color was right on. It was also a little tough, and really didn't have a ton of flavor. The filet was very tender, but was also dry and low on flavor, even though it was the perfect color. I would never order a steak again, for $50 I expect a decent steak. I'd honestly go to outback over Andiron.",

We skipped appetizers and ordered the 8 oz rib eye cap (I added 2 shrimp scampi)  20 oz bone in rib eye, mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and creamed spinach. I ordered my steak well done, as a I always do. I asked if the kitchen would have a problem making it and was assured absolutely not. My steak came out, medium. Lots and lots of pink and lots of blood. That is NOT how I eat my steak. UGH. So I have to send that back. I also have to ask where my shrimp are. I'd like to eat those now while I wait for my steak. Apparently they forgot them, so they came out a few minutes later. One was warm, but cooked. The other was cool and waaaaaay under. OMG, are you serious? Now I have NO steak and no shrimp? The mashed potatoes were not yukon and were runny. Not deliciously creamy as you'd expect. The spinach was good. The asparagus were OK. The manager comp'd us dessert for the steak incident, and they did bring out 3 pipin hot fresh made shrimp after I returned the first one. The creme brulee donuts were SOOOOOO GOOD! Absolutely the best part of my meal. My fiancee enjoyed his medium steak, ate it all! Me, not so much.  Our waiter was fantastic! Vincent I believe. Friendly, funny, helpful. He seemed upset that my steak wasn't cooked properly, he wasn't sure either how you can NOT cook a well done steak?  In the end, this isn't a place I would come back to.   Service, 5 star.

Everything from the menu to the waiters outfits  (gingham shirts & floral ties) is well thought out.  We started out w. beef tartar, it was okay. I LOVE beef tartar but it had way too much onion in it. If i remember correctly it also capers and an egg yolk on top as well. I was missing truffle which I usually love in tartar, also aside from the onion it was a little bland. Also the bread was COMPLETELY burned!  For the main course : My fiance had the bone in porterhouse which he liked and the Mac n cheese waffle which he said the waitress hyped up too much. I had the branzino, which I get quite often at restos. It was not bad, it lacked seasoning and flavor and wasn't as rich and oily as usual. It was underwhelming which is disappointing since I love branzino. The veggie ratatouille type thing on the side was IMO the worst part of my meal BUT the three little dots of the red pepper puree was really yummy.  The dessert was AMAZZZZZING though! The waitress (who was a little weird) recommended other things but we decided to go with the chocolate + banana one (based on the recommendation of a sweet busboy) and boy am I glad! It was unbelievably good, top 3 best desserts I've ever had. Definitely, by far, the best part of our meal.",

    "text": "Our time at Andiron was well enjoyed. This was our first venture for brunch as a group so our expectations for it wasn't necessarily high so it was going to be relatively easy to impress us...again, as a group. The interior is exceptionally white with bright light and colorful floral decor with bar impressively implemented into the room which looks separate but is still easily accessible. The first thing ordered were bottomless mimosas for two of the four at our table. In all respect to the glory that is brunch, I had succumbed to the lure of the steak & eggs with a side order of the Applewood bacon. After which a different server questioned my restraint of the maple glazed Wood Grilled Thick Cut Bacon. He insisted I try it and brought out a small sample of it to taste (in short, the tastiness of the maple glazed Wood Grilled Thick Cut Bacon matched the precision of the use of adjectives in its name).   Within our table, the items ordered were the Steak & Eggs, Serrano Crusted Salmon, The Benedict, Sunday Morning Pancakes, and the Summerlin Omlette. After receiving feedback, all of the dishes ordered were delicious to the taste. The presentation and style of each dish was uniquely fine-tuned to match its flavor. I like when food tastes just as good as it looks. The service was more than helpful in making our experience there pleasant. The woman in charge on keeping on refilling our champagne glasses literally stayed True to the notion of \"bottom-less\" mimosas considering we never saw the bottom of our glasses. I do have to disclose that the champagne used for the mimosas was the low-budget Cook's Champagne. Not going to indulge in that again. I lived the rest of the day in agony.  To sum up, Andiron is a great location for brunch. I do highly recommend it! Stay away from cheap champagne or ask for upgrades.",

This is definitely going to be a place where I'm going to come back and try the lobster roll again as it was absolutely amazing. The overall experience was very good and I'll be coming back but next time with a big group of people and ready to party with the unlimited mimosas .",

My husband and I took a leap and brought our three kids, although I've read it's \"not good for kids\". While it is pricier and very fancy, they accommodated our kids exceptionally!!!! Great choices on the kid menu, booster seats and high chairs. Kid cups, free dessert for kids and ensuring our kids got their orders so quickly!! I am stunned and so happy. Meanwhile, the shrimp cocktail and cornbread was delicious!! Our meals were good as well. The sea bass melts in your mouth, and the Mac n cheese is always a table favorite. We ended with creme brulee donuts that are also amazing. I could go on and on about great details about our meal. Definitely a Wednesday night win! Flawless from start to finish.",

I wouldn't have found this place if it was not for Groupon, but when you call to ask about the restaurant, making tea reservation or just walking in...the exceptional al service and experience begins right then and there. Mike who answered the phone obviously takes pride in the service they provide. He was more than pleasant before and after hearing \"Groupon\" - which as an avid seeker of new restaurant and love using Groupon deals for it, but there can be a stigma that goals along with the use and is usually quite noticeably negative.  We ordered the ribeye, medium rare and cooked perfectly and served with a delectable side of peppercorn sauce . Sides of mashed potatoes and broccolini that were good. Ordered the side of Mac and cheese (so good!!) with a kids meal for my daughter, I think I enjoyed as much as she enjoyed bits of my steak. Dessert we had the Creme brulee donuts (which I thought were good- not amazing as I expected) and the bananas tres leche (yum yum yum!)  What a great experience, can't wait to come back with friends, family and clients!",

The food took much longer than it should have to arrive, and the eggs were unbelievably dry, almost like they'd used powdered eggs. Also, my omelette was missing the gruyere cheese and the breakfast potatoes were raw in the center. I didn't mention it because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to eat  (and had no reason to think they'd get it right the second time) and I didn't tell the manager because he never made an effort to ask how things were. It's hard to understand how a place that bills itself as upscale--and charges accordingly--can do something as simple as EGGS that poorly. Dirty dishes were left on the table for a long time as well. Staff was plenty friendly, but I really can't recall a more disappointing breakfast. My wife actually described it as \"one of the worst meals I've ever had.\" We're locals, and we wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "We came here earlier this month to celebrate my birthday. My first impression of this place was not good. I called about a month ahead to make a reservation and the woman who answered the phone kept me on hold for 10 minutes. I mean really, 10 minutes?? I don't know if they were extremely busy the night that I called, but seriously, she didn't even apologize for making me wait! Besides, wouldn't it take less than a minute to take down my name, phone number and number of people in my party?  Located across from Lazy Dog, the restaurant is very nice and clean. I liked the green and white decor, which was calming. Service was excellent and attentive. Our server made good suggestions on the menu items, all the servers checked up on us often and we never had to ask for drink refills since they were keeping a close eye on everything.  We started off with the Nueske Bacon Wrapped Matzo Balls, which was recommended by our server. This was our first time eating matzo balls, but I thought it was alright - tasted like broth and bacon. Didn't care for the horseradish that came with it. Next, we were served complimentary shrimp cocktail. Not much to say since this tastes the same to me no matter where I go, but it did come with 2 jumbo shrimps! For the main course, I ordered the Black Canyon Ranch Filet, but I wasn't impressed. It tasted alright at first, but after a while, I didn't like the after taste of a burnt steak. Guess I'm really not a fan of char grilled steaks! My husband ordered the Porterhouse, which wasn't horrible but not amazing. I was excited to try the mac & cheese waffle, but it was not as good as it looked. Kind of on the salty side and I am glad that I had them leave the cheese sauce on the side because it wasn't needed. Now to the best part - dessert! The Peanut Butter & Pretzel Caramel Cheesecake was very delicious! The presentation was very unique and did not look like the average cheesecake. We also ordered Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts, which were very good. The donuts were hot crispy on the outside and the creme was perfect and not overly sweet.  Overall, I enjoyed the dessert more than our dinner! I feel bad saying this, but I would rather have a steak from Outback. Don't think I will be back, but they deserve 4 stars for the service, atmosphere and dessert!",

The chicken has zero seasoning and tastes like burnt flour. So bad I returned it for steak and eggs and it was not much better. The potatoes were hard enough to break a tooth. The DJ is a weird touch as itb2as father's day and they are spinning vanilla ice. Overall, a $170 was spent for???? Bad service and bad food.",

Be still my beating heart, I want a plate full of them right at this moment! They are so incredibly light and fluffy inside, delicately crispy on the outside, and scattered throughout little bits of bacon and fresh jalepeno. Please try one.....let's not kid ourselves, more than one! I ordered branzino for the entree, buttery, tender, perfectly executed.  The waiters are professional, knowlegable, and add to the glamorous air.  I know it's pricey, but if you want to celebrate a special occasion, I definitely recommend this gorgeous place!",

It was one that could be suspicious in making us so sick. The shrimp and calamari dish had no shrimp and the sauce that came with it tasted metallic. The Gem Salad was delicious. We also ordered fries with Aioli that our waiter forgot to bring to us.  I think we need to give this place one more try but so far we are not happy with it.  This is an update to my previous review! The Andiron restaurant cared enough to contact us and invite us to give the place a second chance. I believe in second chances. So we just had one of the most memorable dinners tonight. I had the skirt steak and my husband had the hanger steak. We both enjoyed our meals. The drinks and the desert were all great.our server Brian was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and the wine.  Thank you Andiron for a nice evening.",

Out of everything the fried artichokes were our least favorite. They have a lot of batter on them and aren't seasoned well. The salmon and the avocado toast were really the best dishes we had. The salmon is Serrano (ham not pepper) crusted and it really bring a good crispy saltiness to the dish.",

    "text": "The decor is what you'd expect for DTS's only higher priced steak/seafood restaurant. Glimmer and Chic. Gray's and creams are complimented by the rose floral pop. The food almost matches. Almost.   Appetizer: Berrata and Peaches with pistachio and vinegarette. It was Peaches and cream. Nice, fun, and a good set up for dinner.   Dinner. The Honey got the filet mignon. It was cooked perfectly. I got seranno ham crusted salmon with fava bean gnocchi and some kind of reduction with marinated mushrooms. It tasted okay. Just okay. The favs beans were a bit chalky, and I would have liked them paired with something creamy.   Main issue with the restaurant, we paid for great service and decor but the food was mediocre. For $45 for steak without a side, $32 for salmon and bland beans, and $9 for a cappuccino I want flavor, not chandeliers and cute fake candles on the table.   Dessert was the pretzel peanut butter cheesecake. Pleasantly surprised it wasn't overly sweet but no pretzel salt crunch in sight. Grrr.",

None of the dishes were horrible, but it just reminded me of room service food at the one of the higher end Strip hotels. Price point is really high as well, given the quality of the dishes.   For example, the lobster rolls were stingy on the lobster meat and was slathered with mayo. The burrata was microscopic in size. The steak and eggs for $24 looked sad and cooked medium well, instead of the medium that I had requested (I was too hungry to send it back). Decor inside looks nice, but service and vibe is very pretentious. Skip.",

Their beautiful interior design relates to the Hamptons NY style fashion.  The menu is thoughtful and each dish is carefully made to order. They have a terrific kid's menu to boot. Nothing here is short of wonderful.  Our family was greeted by a dish of savory mini cornbread bites to rev-up our appetites. The crab and cod cake appetizer had a crisp exterior and hearty interior. The calamari with shrimp was seasoned well with Cajun deliciousness.  Everyone openly shared how they enjoyed their main entrees (from the branzino to the ribeye)! So, bring you and anyone else you care about.",

Came here for brunch with total of 8 people, the restaurant itself is beautiful, decor on point, servers, there's a DJ playing 80s music? ... there's a candy/snack bar.   The seating for parties more than 4 is Picnic style, so that means scooting out of your seat over people every time you need a refill or to use the restroom . The all you can drink bloody Mary's concept is neat, with the do-it-yourself and choose your own condiments at the bar but it's just too much work.   The food looks good on the menu, I had the Ultimate breakfast Sandwich and shared the Chilaqulles, which were soooo salty. The sandwich had no flavor whatsoever. The others mentioned not enjoying their meals either.   While the service was great, the food not so much and the drink service a pain, there's definitely better spots with great food and better brunch specials - and they'll make your drinks for you.",

We arrived a fair amount earlier than our reservation but they had no problem seating us right away. Our server was pleasant. We ordered the Prime Rib special, filet mignon and the roasted chicken dinners. The truffle mashed potatoes with the prime rib meal came out cold and we told the server. He replaced them except he brought the regular mashed potatoes. Then they replaced those with the correct truffle mashed potatoes but once again they were cold? BF wasn't too happy with his mashed potatoes and prime rib. My son and I enjoyed our filet and chicken dinners we shared however the value just wasn't there. There are too many good Restaurants around where we could get the same meals or better for less $$. For dessert we had gelato which was ok and key lime which had a tart like crust that required a knife. All in all we enjoyed our evening but most likely won't be back.",

The light and airy decor of the dining room stands in contrast to most typical dark wood steakhouses. Come for brunch and the space is flooded with natural light... come for dinner and the warm lights shimmer off the shear and shutters.  I personally prefer the more casual ambience of the bar area... all the bartenders are great and the vibe is just slightly more energetic than the dining room.   The menu is pretty simple, yet with enough variation to please any palette.  Some notables are the Branzino, the burger (might be bar only? Not sure I even saw it on my last visit)... and of course the steaks!  Well seasoned, nicely seared and cooked to the proper temperature... every steak I've had has been a wonderful experience.   Love it here.",

These portions were so tiny, it can't even fill up one person.  After we had 2 dozen of oysters, the tiniest tuna poke, and the tiniest beef tar tar, we left hungry and went somewhere else too eat. The service was pretty bad and we were the only people there.",

I will say it was a huge disappointment.  The ambience is nice and the wait staff were friendly and attentive, very nice.  The menu, I found was dull and lacked any type of flair.  Since nothing really tripped my trigger, I opted for the lobster roll, which was as exciting as a rice cake!  No flavor, no imagination, no salt or pepper on the table, no lemon or extra aioli to dip or spread.  I'll try this restaurant again for an evening meal to see if it surprises me.  Yes, I'm a food snob and I expect more from a place like this. I could have eaten at McDonald's and it would have more flavor.   Come on Andiron, step it up.",

It's definitely not your average steak house! Favorite appetizer on the high end side would have to be the shellfish platter for 2! It's the best way to try some fresh shellfish! Exotic wise I love the uni toast or foie gras app good way to get the palate going  ! Gotta try the waffle Mac n cheese as a side ! And all the entrees are good jus depends what your in the mood for and how much of a appetite you have! They have small fillets to big t-hawk ribeyes, also some vegetarian entrees too!",

My meal continued on with the burrata and fig salad.  The burrata was so creamy and mouth watering...the figs fresh and sweet a perfect compliment.  I decided to order the organic chicken with a side of twice baked potatoes.  The corn pudding was delightful - perfectly seasoned.  The twice baked potatoes were pretty good but not the best I have ever eaten.  The only small disappointment was the chicken.  Although it was tasty...it was not as moist as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  I am giving it a 4 star mostly based on the chicken and the less than average tasting plain iced tea.  Hopefully these will be improved over the next few months.  I will stop by again to fill you in.",

My gosh was our entire dinner through cocktails, aps,main course and desert were all exceptional.  Some of the best food I have eaten in Las Vegas. Maybe they went on a bad night or just got unlucky, but my entire party was raving about the staff/food/service/decor.  Was it on the higher price level? Yes, but if you do not expect that from a fine dining establishment these days then head out beyond the mountains and out of the valley here.  Generally you get what you pay for.  I am just so happy that we didnt listen to the naysayers.  We had 4 different aps, 4 different main courses and two incredible deserts.  Everything was delicious and the sauces were exquisite.  We will definately be returning.  Try it for yourself.  There are so many factors that create negative reviews, dont keep yourselves from a gem of a place because a few people had a bad night.  Andiron is just fabulous.  Congrats Elizabeth and Kim... another winner for burbs!!",

First you are served two really tiny cornbread sticks that looked like they were made in an easy bake oven.  Just two.  the accompaning  butter dish was larger than the two combined.  My wife's Butter Poached lobster was such a small portion that I would be embarrassed to serve it to anyone if I ran the place.  The lobster was overcooked.  The side of asparagus spears was under cooked. We were served eight spears and left five and a half.  Unedible.  Where was our waiter you ask?  I don't know.  I didn't see him again till we wanted our check.  During our meal the couple across the aisle from us enjoying dinner was approached no less than three times by management and asked how there meal was going.  I was close enough to hear the questions.  How many times were we asked that?  ZERO!!!To add insult to injury, they doubled billed my credit card for the balance and I had to get that corrected the next day.  They might as well put a sign on the front door that reads,\"no groupon or non-alcoholic drinkers wanted\".  I spoke to the general manager the next day about my concerns and he was very apologetic but the damage was already done.  I'll bet I can find another restaurant to patronize that may want to treat us a little better.",

I must say, Andiron exceeded all expectations we had! My fiance loves Bloody Marys, and orders one whenever we go out, and he said that theirs was one of the best he's ever had. We started with the calamari, and although I wasn't a huge fan of the sriracha dipping sauce they served with it, it was good. I had the 8 oz. filet medium rare. It came out a little more rare, but I don't mind a little \"moo\" in my meat, so all was good and dandy. He ordered the 12 oz. dry aged ribeye and it was cooked perfectly. They both were served with the Andiron steak sauce and it was delicious!! We shared the twice baked potato, which was amazing, and the asparagus. The only negative part of our experience was the noise. We were seated directly in front of the live musician (who was incredibly talented, by the way), and it was really loud. His amp was turned up a little too loud, and it was hard to hold a conversation even though we were sitting next to each other. Other than that, we had a great experience, and we will definitely be dining there again!",

We have been here several times before and enjoyed the variety of options. Unfortunately, upon being seated we were informed that there was an entirely different menu prior to 8:30pm. The holiday menu required pre purchasing a \"ticket\", which was not noted anywhere on the menu link (although all other details were listed including the price). Had we known this, we certainly would have purchased tickets and were very disappointed at the uninspired menu available to the rest of us...chicken, pasta,...blah. Our server really tried help by offering a fish dish that wasn't on the early menu but nothing from the holiday menu. Atmosphere was festive but as we were wrapping up, it was clear that they were setting up for the \"ticketed\" crowd and the rest of us were just filler. (We didn't even have a tablecloth, just placemats like it's was brunch or something.) Dinner was nice but otherwise not memorable, even for a regular night. There are simply too many amazing restaurants just within the Summerlin area to bother giving Andiron another go.",

    "text": "This review is for their 2015 Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu.  Of course, it's necessary that a high-end shopping center such as Downtown Summerlin has its own steakhouse. The menus take a spin on classic, familiar favorites and isn't limited to steak and seafood.   Although not on the three-course Restaurant Week menu, I had to try the Hudson Valley Seared Foie Gras. Nestled upon toasted brioche with streaks of huckleberry jam on either side, this immediately became a hit at the table.   For my first course I ordered the Andiron Caesar. It's your basic Caesar, but then again it isn't. The salad was lightly dressed and accented with whole wheat croutons and large flakes of parmesan cheese. My boyfriend chose the Old Bay Shrimp Cocktail. Andiron's take on the traditional 99 shrimp cocktail that you could probably still find in older downtown casinos. Two fresh, jumbo size shrimp accompanied by horseradish cocktail sauce to give your taste buds a bit of a zing.   I ordered the Scottish Salmon for my second course, mainly for its serrano ham crust. The meat was flaky and the artichokes accompanied the fish nicely. Cooked at medium-rare, my boyfriend's rib eye cap was delicious and tender.  We finished off dinner with a third course of dessert. After devouring one of Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts, I'm convinced that this is *the* dessert that everyone has to order while here; it was basically the highlight of dinner. The donuts are filled with vanilla custard that just oozes out after one bite. To my surprise, these weren't dense. The donuts overshadow the Almond Cherry Clafoutis, dessert two. Now this one was dense and flan-like. Despite a small serving of sweet vanilla ice cream, this didn't win me over.   Dinner was wonderful, and the service was excellent. As a local, this is one neighborhood steakhouse that I wouldn't remind returning to again.",

A great eatery with vibrant local energy, great food, warm open ambiance, and enough restrained creativity to keep you coming back.  BRUNCH:  Three words:  Bloody Mary Bar.  Simply outstanding.  From well chosen mixes and vodka through an dizzying array of some 12 seasoned salts and two dozen hot sauces, to bacon, boiled shrimp, olives, onions, pickles, veg.  Something is wrong with you if you can't create the perfect Bloody Mary.    Drinks alone don't make a brunch so add a bunch of shareable plates.  The burrata and roasted peaches, watercress, drizzled with white balsamic and topped with crunchy pistachios, screams summer.  Beautiful balance that wakes the palate.  A very good, mustardy, course cut steak tartare with bits of cornichons on grilled bread also a great brunchable.  Bitter and tangy, all work to sweeten the raw beef and punch up the mineral flavor.  Throw in some avocado toast, jumbo shrimp cocktail, a couple dozen oysters, and some fire grilled thick cut bacon (no complaints on any) and brunch is complete.  Note:  There are other more traditional brunch items and a nice looking mimosa bar.  DINNER:  It's all about the steaks.  Focus on the butchers cuts for the most flavor  Steaks are charred over a wood fire imparting the classic wood grilled flavor with sweet smoky bitterness.  Great sear, even cooking, to temp, moderately well trimmed.  The flatiron has the most pronounced beef flavor, the tri tip beefy and juicy, the rib cap, tender and juicy.    Sides are simple and seasoned in a way that properly matches the grilled flavor of the steaks.  The wood fired asparagus, slightly crisp and topped with a romesco and roasted broccolini with earthy parm and a squeeze of lemon to cut the fattiness of the steak.    Finally, the mac and cheese waffle.  Interesting, crispy on the outside while maintaining a creamy, gooey core.  Great when hot but tires the palate as it cools.  Well chosen wine list.   Relaxed local service.  Pricing of some items rivals the Strip.  All told, recommended.",

    "text": "This is one of those reviews that starts out like \"I wanted to like this place BUT....\". Don't get me wrong, Andiron's nails the ambiance factor and presents visually stunning food, but I thought the food was mediocre. Basically, I was turned off by the heavy handed use of salt and capers in the food. Just FYI, I hate salt. I'm more of a pepper kind of girl. Anyways, my husband and I chose to eat at Andiron Steak & Sea to celebrate our 8 year marriage anniversary. I actually picked the place because the fanciness appealed to me and I loved that vegetarian options were offered at a steakhouse.    COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Two rolls that were flaky on the outside and airy on the inside were served with a side of seasoned butter. These were very salty (I think the butter had capers). I am all about bread baskets, but I couldn't even finish my roll. 2/5  ANDIRON CAESAR ($12): I sampled some from my husband's plate. Again, very salty but capers were listed on the menu. I've come to the conclusion I hate capers. 2/5  PORK SCHNITZEL ($25): Visually pleasing and husband said it was \"pretty good\". I sampled the red wine cabbage served on the side and was surprised at how sweet it was. I called it dessert cabbage. 4/5  ROASTED CAULIFLOWER STEAK ($23): This entree elicited ooohs and ahhs from the table next to us, but taste wise, fell flat. The giant mushrooms were super chewy and the vinegar dressing was too sour for my tastes. I wouldn't order this again. 2/5  MAC & CHEESE WAFFLE ($11): One of the most innovative things I've seen but dammit, why is it so salty?? 3/5        VIBE: Open and airy, cloaked in mostly whites, and accented by small floral designs and shades of green. The crowd was of the refined type and were mostly older folks. I was impressed with the ambiance, that's for sure. 4.5/5  SERVICE: Eh. I was asked 3 times by 3 different people if I wanted something to drink besides water. By the third time, I was annoyed. My husband got a coke and it was perpetually empty, although the staff were quick to refill our water glasses. I felt like the server was trying too hard to up-sell us. 2/5   Worth a Return Visit? My reasoning behind the 3 stars is this: If you're going to charge high prices for food, that food better be excellent. I don't know if I'll come back to Andiron because the chef in there is going crazy with salt and capers.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #111",

    "text": "This place had some great decor and ambience in my opinion. The vibe was not stuffy, which is a plus.   The service was below average though I don't fault our server because he seemed like he was looking after more tables than he should have been.   Our steaks (our party ordered three cowboy ribeyes among other things) came out all at different temperatures despite ordering two mid rare and one medium. We had to send one back to be remade because it was way over cooked! They did that for us but I just wish it didn't have to happen that way.   The door was also open which allowed a stiff breeze in the restaurant. We didn't ask them to close it but thought it was ironic that the hostess seemed to have a space heater near her. So they knew it was cold!   It was good food with great company in a visually appealing restaurant. However, it was simply average in my opinion after factoring all of it together.",

    "text": "Food and beverage is par for the course, but there is nothing to distinguish Andiron from other area steakhouses.  I came in for dinner on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was empty with a few people in the bar area.  After sitting down, I received a lukewarm greeting from the bartender before perusing a menu.  The bar is well stocked with liquor.  If you like whiskey, you'll find no shortage of options.  Drinks are half off during happy hour which is a reasonable value.  I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon with gnocchi, roasted butternut squash, and kale as well as a side of broccolini.  The salmon was cooked to temperature.  The portion size was reasonable.  The food tasted good but didn't blow my socks off.  It was about on par for the price, maybe slightly below.  This is the crux of Andiron.  The food and beverage selection is about what you would expect for the price point, and that's about it.  The ambiance is muted.  The staff, with some exception, is unegaged with their customers.  For the same or slightly more money, there are better options (within walking distance).",

    "text": "Dinner reservation 6:30 pm on Saturday night. I've been looking forward to dining here since they opened. Went with a couple of friends. My two star review is based solely on my meal.   Decor and ambiance 4 stars. Has a nice tropical feel, mostly all white with some floral patterns. Nice outdoor patio, nice bar area.   Bar 4 stars. Big and roomy. I had a moscow mule served in a copper mug. At least 4 bartenders on staff.   Restaurant service 4 stars. A nice greeting by the hostess, and our waitress was very pleasant and professional. Gave us the low down on a couple specials as well as some recommendations for the meal. Plenty of service staff on hand.  The food - well this is where it gets interesting. We ordered the Foie Gras brulee as an appetizer. It was accompanied by some huckleberry jam that was delicious. Unfortunately the bread that came with the foie gras was burnt. Ended up using the bread that came with the table, and even that wasn't all that impressive. Dry and hard.  My friends ordered Scottish Salmon and Pork Schnitzel. The Schnitzel was pretty tasty, lightly breaded with a hint of lemon. Both of them enjoyed their meal. I ordered the Prime ribeye \"mignon\" which was supposed to be the center cut of ribeye, with the most flavor. $41. I ordered it medium rare. When it came out, it was closer to medium and wasn't moist and flavorful, but rather firm and bland. The accompanying steak sauce was mandatory to add flavor and it wasn't that great either. I was pretty disappointed with this selection.  Overall, nice place but the food wasn't up to the standards I expect, especially a steak when you call yourself a steakhouse. Don't think I\"ll be coming back here when there are many other quality restaurants to choose from.",

    "text": "I had a 7:45 reservation and I arrived about 5 minutes early.  I was able to sit in the coveted \"private dining room\" which in fact for me was the patio area.  I was the only one who wanted to sit out on a very pleasant night when the wind had stopped and the temperature was pleasant.  Service started quickly and remained top notch throughout the entire evening.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought with a small shaker bottle of simple syrup.  My order included French onion soup for the appetizer, the 9 ounce Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras addition for the main course accompanied by their Mac & Cheese waffle.  For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee doughnuts.  It seemed like a long wait for the onion soup but I was enjoying the beautiful evening and the people watching the patio afforded.  I could hear the music from inside and the patio proved the golden place to sit this night.  The onion soup was brought and it was well worth the wait.  The rich broth with sliced onions and topped with gruyere and parmesan cheeses was very good.  Shortly after the soup was brought, a server asked if I wanted some bread.  I asked for some but asked for a small amount--not a full portion.  I was brought two end pieces of wonderful bread with butter that was topped with some black salt crystals.  It was excellent.  The butter had softened from the warm bread and spread beautifully.  I had asked for my steak to be as rare as possible, a difficult request for skirt steak because of the lack of thickness to this cut.  It was done perfectly.  It was accompanied by a glazed shallot and some chimichurri sauce in a small gravy boat type container.  On the side were three pieces of the mac & cheese waffle and the one server urged me to eat the waffle while it was hot.  This cut of steak is known for its flavor and it was very good.  It was tender and moist.  The foie gras was outstanding.  That was the first thing I ate, and I savored every piece.  The mac and cheese waffles were served with the same type of small gravy boat but with a cheese sauce.  Altogether, the waffles, the foie gras, and the steak made for an outstanding main course.    Room for dessert--of course.  Well, I did leave one waffle, but the server had been correct about eating these while hot.  It lost a little something as the waffle cooled somewhat.  My server told me about a special sorbet for that evening but I had to go with the creme brulee doughnuts.  It was the right choice to make.  These are doughnut holes filled with vanilla custard and they are so good.  None of the three was left.  Service throughout the night was excellent.  My main server, Keith, accompanied by his co-server Lewis, made sure that my iced tea glass was always filled.  It seemed like several of the servers from inside, when they stepped out for a quick breath of fresh air, stopped by to check on me.    Two hours later, I left having enjoyed the private dining room and filled with good food.  Prices are on the high side--Downtown Summerlin pricing--but I knew this going in so there's no complaint about that.  It was a very good dinner with excellent service in very enjoyable surroundings.",

I ordered a medium rare filet mignon and the girlfriend got caramelized scallops. The filet was cooked to Perfection and paired perfectly with a side of mashed potatoes.  The scallops were nice and soft, sweet, and flavorful as well. My brother and mom ordered the fried Brazino, it had a nice crisp on the top and melted in your mouth. My sister in law ordered a lobster roll and it was very fresh and exquisitely prepared. We ordered the crepe brulee donuts, they were okay. Would definitely come again",

    "text": "Having a restaurant like Andiron is a real treat in Summerlin. It saves me the time to go to the Strip. We've come for family dinners with larger groups and I've come on my own and sat at the bar. Always a great meal - simple done well. I love their lobster roll! The truffle fries are delicious and the little gem salad it's thick pieces of bacon is something I crave often. The steaks are well cooked and great quality meat. When I've gone with family we've ordered the steaks, calamari, Mac and cheese, short ribs, and brussel sprouts. We haven't had a bad meal. Maybe it's not an every night meal since it's not cheap, but I think more value than expensive. We enjoy the atmosphere here and the food. The staff are both friendly, helpful and laid back in a good way.   I haven't tried happy hour but thinking of trying next time just to see.  Oh, desserts! Vanilla donuts are awesome piping hot. The candy car cake is decadent and although I can't eat it all the time but worth the wait when I can.  My favorite in downtown Summerlin for an upscale restaurant.",

It was top with a lemon glaze and blueberries with a blueberry sauce.  The outer rim of the pancakes was crispy.  I also had their housemade pork sausage.  They were great. The whole meal is very filling. I highly recommend this restaurant for brunch.",

    "text": "Went to dinner here last night for Wedding Anniversary. Gotta say we weren't overly impressed given the amount we paid. Maybe the staff wasn't feeling it that night cause it was a slow Tuesday night. Server just didn't seem too interested.  It took until after getting our appetizers that we got our drinks! The server said the bartender was too busy talking to notice our drink ticket. The restaurant had maybe 5 tables and the bar area half full. And she didn't even apologize for the lateness of the drinks. I had to make a joke about it being slow that she told me why they were late. The bread they served was two small pieces of fancy cornbread muffins. Wasn't asked if we'd like more. You'd think a bread basket or at least more would be offered like at similar places of their caliber.  We also weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks when she asked how our meal was. Clearly our drinks were close to becoming empty. Plus knowing how long it took the first time to get drinks you'd think she'd be on top of that?! The secondary staff was more engaging and helpful than our actual server! At the end she grabbed the check barely making eye contact and just said thanks. Not \"Hope everything was to you satisfaction...please come back\" etc.  The steaks were pretty amazing! Everything else was meh. We actually choose this place instead of goin to Echo and Rig. Kinda regretting that now. We still tipped 20% not wanting to screw the support staff but definitely felt like service could have been much better given the slow night. I don't need my ass kissed constantly but I definitely want to enjoy the entire dining experience. Too many quality steakhouses in Vegas to choose from so definitely won't be back or be recommending!",

    "text": "The wife and I aren't usually brunch types, but we were feeling it on a Saturday.  Since we were in the general vicinity, we decided to give Andiron Steak & Sea a try.  We got to the restaurant a little after noon.  The restaurant was fairly full, but we were able to be seated immediately.  Andiron's space was bright and airy and evoked what I imagined to be a Miami or the Hampton's vibe in the desert.  While it was 5 o'clock somewhere, I was driving so I went with some much-needed coffee.  The wife and I shared an order of the Burrata & Prosciutto.  We received a healthy dollop of fresh burrata atop a lightly dressed bed of greens and sugar peas with thinly-sliced prosciutto.  It was light with a nice contrast of flavors and textures and a perfect start.  For my entree, I had the Lobster Roll.  In truth, I thought it was a bit on the small side for its $19 price and maybe not a good sign when the pile of potato chips was roughly the same size as the actual lobster roll.  However, it possessed all of the lobster-y goodness that I was hoping to find.  The roll was fresh and was the perfect medium for the diced chunks of tender lobster.  I was satisfied.  Service throughout our meal was attentive as our water glasses and cups of coffee were kept topped off.  Andiron Steak & Sea was a good choice for brunch.  I'd gladly do it again.  I'd also like to revisit for dinner.",

    "text": "Overall not the best experience; I'd give them a 2.5, but they tried, so I'll round up.  Taylor and I tried Andiron for my birthday dinner. We were early for our reservation but were able to be seated right away so that was nice; and then almost everything else went downhill.   But before I digress here's what went right: decent cocktails, good calamari app, and an assistant server who was hustling and genuinely connecting with tables- he needs a promotion!   Our server wasn't very attentive and didn't have a lot of service acumen for the this restaurant environment. If he did come by our table, it was always frantic and rushed, often walking away before we finished speaking. But as issues with the wait times on both our appetizer and entrees emerged, he was usually nowhere to be found and very obviously avoided us. When he did eventually bring our app, he didn't really acknowledge the long wait.   For addressing our entree wait time, he had the hostess come handle it. She didn't have the guts to own the situation when she greeted us and made me be the one to quickly volunteer the issue.   When our food finally arrived, I was very unimpressed. You can see the entirety of lobster in my \"lobster\" mac picked out on that plate. Pathetic. The sauce was also bland and boring with falling apart pasta. I also tried the crispy Brussels sprouts; they weren't. They were soggy and saturated in some sort of glaze/sauce, probably because they waited around for a burger for so long. Taylor did like his burger though, but I don't think it was anything remarkable.   Because of the long wait for a burger and mac and cheese, they said they would be treating us to a special dessert. It was baked Alaska. Does anyone actually like this dessert or did cruise ship kitchens invent it just to receive half hearted \"oohs and ahhs\"??   The ice cream was rock hard and not very good so we barely picked at it and left ASAP. Nothing like messing up our special outing and attempting to make it up with another unimpressive bust. Unfortunate too, because they had some other actually impressive/edible desserts going around the restaurant that I would have been interested to try but with the lackluster, perfunctory service and mediocre fare, we had enough. We definitely won't be back (not even for my complimentary check in dessert).",

My kids were eyeing the little candy bar they had upfront and we used it as bait for our kids to behave and eat. Lol we ordered the chilaquiles and the banana nutella french toast, fruit, and eggs for the kids. This place is the 2nd best in chilaquiles, the first being the beachcomber in newport, ca. This isnt super traditional as it's a softer chip, but it's how we like it! It's really good with an addition of Tabasco. The french toast was super yummy, I just wish we added strawberries to it. The service was great and our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. We will be back. My only gripe is that the place is a little pricey, but we dont mind as it feels like we arent in vegas at this place!",

The beef tartare was ok but not my favorite. I liked the Crispy calamari shrimp and loaded tator tots.   The waitress Renee? wasn't too happy when we ordered only from the happy hour food until we ordered from the dinner menu. I don't remember what we ordered on the dinner menu. I thought the food was just average, not outstanding. She checked up on us when it was early then was forgotten after the place got busy. Our glasses of water were empty and had to wave them for it and for the bill etc. We had a bunch of cocktails and I liked them. I also enjoyed their pumpkin deserts.",

Their wine list was full of some of my favorites and all reasonably priced for a steak house. The service was assertive and quick. They also had vegan options on their menu! I ordered the butternut squash soup and avocado toast. Both were amazing and full of flavor:) my boyfriend ordered a filet mignon... we shared the garlic broccolini.

We were a party of eight on the patio and it was a beautiful day. The venue is awesome and the patio is stunning.  Other than that, we didn't have a great experience. I ordered the Burrata and Beet Salad and the Benedict as is.  The eggs were watery and runny. Not in a yolky way, more like they didn't drain them properly when they pulled them from the water. The english muffin was nearly impossible to cut through, even with a steak knife. And the hollandaise was bland. The worst part was that there was a hair on my plate between the egg and the muffin. I did address it with my server but there had been no lack or urgency by her so by the time she came back to our table I was over the experience. She hadn't come to check on us either so it didn't help that we had to flag her over.  They did take it off our bill, which was very nice.  Our whole table was underwhelmed by the food as well as the service. Hopefully things have turned around but all in all, I can't put this in my top places to recommend.",

We came on Thursday and it's all day happy hour for the cocktails and certain starter foods. It has a fine dining feel to it without the insane prices. I wasn't too impressed with the food which is why I gave it four stars. We ordered the salmon tacos, the calamari, the lobster Mac and the oysters. The oysters were delicious, the salmon tacos were too small for the price. It was literally three bites and the texture was similar to a puree. The lobster Mac didn't have any lobster from the taste of it and the calamari was good. Otherwise great experience, the server and the bartenders were enjoyable. They also have a nice patio for brunch. We came too late but the brunch menu looks absolutely delicious. We will be returning for the delicious cocktails and to taste the brunch menu.",

    "text": "BRUNCH: the socially acceptable excuse for day drinking and dressing up for no reason! My 2 girlfriends and I are always on the hunt for cute places for Sunday brunch and we opted to try this place out (with the help of Yelp!). Located in downtown Summerlin, we were very pleased with the venue -- which is very spacious, elegantly decorated and fits the bill for a classy brunch. Let the bottomless mimosas begin!   I ordered: - THE LOBSTER BENEDICT: english muffin, with poached eggs, spinach, shaved porchetta and bearnase sauce, with a side of breakfast potatoes. (The original benedict is $16.00; add salmon for an additional $7.00 or lobster for additional $10.00).  - HALF DOZEN OYSTERS (2): ordered two of these for the complete dozen; served on ice with a classic red wine mignoette. ($18.00 each)  Their brunch menu also has a decent variety -- from shareable appetizers, early riser breakfast items, afternoon delight lunch options, and various sides (not to mention desserts!). The food presentation was beautiful and we enjoyed the live DJ! Highly recommend this place, as it definitely has that brunch pizzazz we were hoping for (plus the little free dessert/candy table is a beautiful touch!).   My only complaint was our server was not very tentative and did not check up on us at all (we kept having to flag down other staff members to get our bottomless mimosas filled; ended up only having 3 because it got annoying staring to the back hoping he would make eye contact with us!) But I definitely will be back to try out their Happy Hour menu which is daily from 4:00pm to 7:00pm (gotta try those $1.00 oysters on Tuesdays for sure!)  *Check in on Yelp for a free dessert!",

The servers were very polite but I think they need to work on getting customers the things they ordered correctly. Was looking forward to trying the cowboy ribeye but it doesn't look like we are coming here again.   NY Steak: was dry no flavor. Had to douse it with BBQ Sauce.  Asparagus: fresh and good  French fries: top was crunchy but got to the bottom and center of the fries and it was soggy.   Chimichurri sauce: it was ok...

The head chef is German and was automatically in love with the fact that they have Spatzle on the menu.  Not a fan of this by anyone at our table,  it is something that I have grown to love and appreciate.  Although it is just an appetizer, it's worthy I would think of something to have to share....although many other impressive appetizers.  The filet was perfect although they do not have Bearnaise sauce that if its something that one comes accustomed to having with their filets, it may be hard to not sigh deeply in disapproval.  I got over it and by no means a deal breaker....Apparently the Moscow Mules are a hit,  but stuck with their Malbec they offered by the glass.  Meh...good, but I see why it's the one they offer by the glass.  Ultimately this place is something straight out of Scottsdale which is always a plus.  Summer lim is doing its best to be quite the place to live....maybe one day.    Valet is in the back, so make sure you go past it and make the right which is behind Andiron.",

I quickly called to fix, and was give the run around by manager after manager. They gave every excuse of why It was done, or it being an accident. But conveniently the cards were charged perfectly to the amount of the bill, not considering the $200 in cash. Very shady experience will never return! Advice to the wise never pay with large amount of cash, and card! Such a shame to have a bad experience at a Elizabeth Blau restaurant!",

While yes, the food was tasty the service was somewhat lacking - especially considering they were WAY overstaffed.  5 of us dined at Andiron on Saturday. I had the pork schnitzel which was delicious. This was served on a bed of cranberry sauce with a side of cous cous. Also, the Mac n Chz waffle waffle was to die for. My friends all had steak and all seemed happy with their selections.  Now for the service.... First, we were greeted and offered our choice of bottled water or \"filtered water which is unlimited at $4 for the entire table.\"  Gimme a break!!!!  This was very insulting as to say \"who on earth would opt for the free Las Vegas water straight from the tap.  Anyway, after settling for the regular tap water it was apparent that it wasn't bottomless as never were we offered a refill. I literally had to flag down a server each time someone needed their glass topped off. I finally ordered a diet coke and should have savored it since I was never offered a refill here either.  I have no doubt this will be a successful restaurant.... But first they have some kinks to work through. Give it a few months before you visit.",

All in all, give this place 6 months to a year to sort out their waitstaff issues and maybe it'll be worth visiting.

    "text": "Had a night out with family last night and thought we'd try the new Andiron in Downtown Summerlin.  The rating is a 2.5 stars!  We arrived early to avoid any crowds, with a 5:30 reservation.  The place was pretty empty, with only a couple other diners there.  Upon arrival, our waiter, asked for drinks and served them.  He had trouble either listening or understanding requests, as my mother had wanted ice in her juice and didn't get it...and he seemed to question our requests.  Not sure what was going on there.  Anyway, we all decided pretty quickly what we wanted, as the menu is super limited and there are no specials to heat about.  We were told, 'the whole menu is special'.  Turn off!  My husband had a salad with his meal and ordered an appetizer.   He got the calamari.  Upon arrival, it looked ok with the typical small round pieces and some other larger, flat pieces, that didn't look natural.  He ate a few pieces and said there was something wrong with it.  He didn't enjoy it at all so when they came to remove his salad plate he told them to remove the calamari and told them there was something wrong with it.  We sat and talked together for at least an hour while waiting for our meals.  It was getting obnoxious, esp considering how early we arrived and got our order in.  Then, when they finally walked out with food, they only had three plates and apologized that the last steak order got messed up and that they were firing it.  I couldn't believe it.  By then, with lack of attentiveness by our server and the long wait times, this place was quickly becoming a place we would never visit again.  I made clear my dissatisfaction to our server that after all this time they wouldn't bring all the meals together, but the last one quickly arrived.  The steaks were good.  Mine was ordered med rare, but was rare, so that was disappointing.  I ordered with asparagus and none of the ends were cut off so the last 3\" of each stalk was inedible because it was so stringy.  My husband ordered the pork chop and it had an awful sauce on top....it was very bitter with the texture of jelly.  The chop itself was good.  The other steak was really good as was the fish dish.  The food wasn't all awful, but with the service lacking so bad, it surely doesn't make you want to ever visit again.  After the meals, dessert menus were dropped, but we didn't want any, as we had now been there 2.5hrs to have a meal.  Those menus sat on the table for another very long time before anyone came back to ask us if we wanted any....and it wasn't even our server.  He never came back to the table again to ask how things were (as I think he already knew).....and we just asked for the check so we could leave.  We will personally never dine at this establishment again due to horrible service and wait times for the meal.  PS.  They bring out corn bread early on and I hear it's good, as I didn't have any.",

    "text": "Very disappointed. Made a reservation for 5:30 PM and was sure to include that we were celebrating my wife's birthday (included her name).  Arrived on time and promptly seated. Previous reviews are spot on. With the very nice atmosphere, decor and courteous reception, I was set to be impressed. My first doubt entered when we were offered bottled water. I declined for the table. Glasses were immediately cleared and no further offer of water was proffered. OK, an oversight not to bring generic ice water - soldier on - I mean it's only water.  Ordered drinks and things again took an upswing. We all had the Frecnh Onion Soup and I must say it was quite good - now not only on the upswing but looking forward to a lovely evening.  Ordered sequentially, the Ribeye Cap Steak, NY Strip, and the 20 oz. bone in Ribeye. The steaks arrived and I will give credit for the fact that they arrived cooked to order despite our lengthy enjoyment of the soup. However, this is when things went downhill in a hurry. The quality of the meat was just barely above any restaurant in Vegas - and I would include just about ANY steak restaurant in town, regardless of price or ambiance. The cap steak was unappealing at best and the bone in Ribeye was just plain terrible. By the time I finished, there was more bone and fat left on my plate than the steak that I managed to cut away. The NY Strip was adequate, although, for the price, I would have to say \"barely\" adequate.  The sides were billed as \"family\" portions that could be shared. I will say they were fairly good but each portion was \"individual\" at best. On an up note, if you do try this place, make sure to order the waffle mac-n-cheese - certainly the highlight of the meal.  Overall, the meal was about on par with any chain steakhouse to include Claim Jumper, John Cutter's, and OK, Denny's. The problem with Andiron is that the bill came to $250 before the tip. I don't gripe about price as long as it is worth the expense. This, clearly, was not.  Andiron seems to bill themselves as a high end steak and seafood restaurant. In reality, they are a great deal of atmosphere with mediocre service and substandard food. You can park all the Mercedes and Jags on the curb that you want but the food and service must deliver.  I suppose the most disappointing thing was the fact that the waiter and bar attendant must have overheard our comments of disappointment because at the conclusion of our meal the Maitre De came by for a second time. His question? \"How are you doing?\" I responded \"Fine.\" (Since I was indeed fine). He smiled... and WALKED AWAY. Oh, and by the way, never once did anyone acknowledge my wife's birthday.   If you want to spend $100 a person on a meal, please consider Michael's at the South Point or Twin Creeks at the Silverton. At Michael's you will get in spades what Andiron promises but utterly fails to deliver. At Twin Creeks you will get a little more than Andiron delivers, at half the price.  A Follow Up:  I was contacted by Andrew the following day. My guess is that my written comment on the bill that I \"will not be back\", finally got someone's attention. Andrew was pleasant and urged me to return so they could \"make up for our bad experience.\" I have raised my rating of this establishment from one to two stars based solely on the fact that Andrew went to the trouble to contact me. Unfortunately, our experience was bad enough that I am afraid we will not be able to take Andrew up on his kind offer to give them another try. But, thank you anyway.",

We started with the seafood tower which was perfectly fine by Las Vegas standards but nothing too exciting.  We then moved onto the steak tartar and the sea urchin toast.  Both were good, the tartar lacked flavor and the toast served with it was grilled and burned which distracted from the flavor.  The sea urchin was very good and I would order again.   The disaster came with the main course.  I ordered the bone in dry aged NY Strip.  The first one arrived at medium well. I of course returned the steak and when the second came it was cooked correctly to medium rare, but the meat has absolutely no flavor at all and was inedible.  The manager was apologetic and stated they needed to find a new purveyor for their meat! Shocking this was not dialed in before opening! The owners Elizabeth and Kim were not in attendance and you could see the difference from when they opened Honey Salt.  Maybe they have grow too fast, I know the Manager was with another unhappy guest before speaking with us. The room is beautiful and well appointed but the service and more importantly the food is lacking. I cannot recommend this restaurant and think they should remove the \"steak\" from the name Andiron Steak and Sea!",

Shortly after, we realized we were there during restaurant week and wanted to try a little bit of everything that way. In my opinion, wouldn't you put smaller portions of your best dishes on it to intrigue your clientele's taste buds? Immediately after telling the server, he had an attitude with us. As if we were no longer good enough to sit in his section. The food was mediocre and neither of us were able to finish our steaks. In addition, we ordered the Mac & Cheese Waffle which was tasty but nothing to rave about. At the end of the day, I just think the customer service was a 2 star but your sommelier raised it up a star by her knowledgable demeanor and positive attitude.",

I only gave it 2 stars because of the waitress.  Overall the service was very quick.Our individual who introduced as our server did not help much. The gentleman with the water and cleaning the table did most of the work.  It was hard to get her attention.   At check out we gave her 2 credit cards and Cash.  We stated one amount on the first credit card, the cash and the balance on the 2nd credit card.  When she brought it back she split the bill only between the two credit cards and did not put the cash on.  She fumbled with an with an explanation but it did not seen very sincere.  She did return the Cash eventually but the experience had already ruined our visit.  What if we didn't check our bill and compare notes. I don't think I will be back.",

    "text": "I dined at Andiron on June 06 with some of my friends. The atmosphere and decor are amazing. The acoustics are also much better than some of the other fine dinning close to the area. It was nice to actually go out and be able to hear the conversations happening across the table. Silvia was our waitress and she was pretty good. Very sweet and soft spoken. Majority of the food was excellent, my only complaint was that the ice tea was literally the same color as water. It was so diluted it was sad for a tea drinker and I found the yellow tail to be a bit embarrassing. She had recommended that for an appetizer and I was blown away at how little the pieces were. It comes with 8 pieces, which sounds good if you are used to eating sashimi, but in reality it was two pieces of yellowtail cut into 8. If you want to serve the tiniest little pieces of yellow tail in town that is fine, but you should serve it on a smaller plate so that it is less noticeable. I literally took a picture of it to send to a friend because it was laughable. The mac and cheese waffle was a little too salty and not a great as I had hoped but it was still a cool idea. I had the scallops and they were incredible. I would recommend them to anyone. The meal was a tad expensive, which I had anticipated but there are other places in town that are better for the money (Honey salt, Marche bacchus). We all had a good experience and I think all but one really enjoyed their meal (she had the halibut). I would come back again.",

    "text": "My one dinner here met with mixed results, but on the whole this fairly new restaurant in Downtown Summerlin shows much promise.  Yet it appears to not be very accommodating, based on the three examples I encountered, as follows: 1) Despite great pics of French Onion Soup on Yelp, the dish has been killed for the season.  Why?  Winter is almost here, and hot soup seems in order.  2) No anchovies are available to be added to a Caesar Salad.  3)  The kitchen declined to make a Loaded Baked Potato without chives or to put cheese and bacon inside a cooked spud.  3)  A request for two checks for one table was rejected.  But these grumblings aside, a Gem Lettuce Salad was large and excellent, accompanied by very good Sourdough Bread.  And my Harris Ranch Prime Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  Three fine sauces, including Bearnaise and Peppercorn, harmonized nicely with the flavorful meat, and I enjoyed the cooked Shishito Peppers that came with the Filet.    But our server did not initially seem to understand the concept of Drawn Butter, and we were asked if we wanted an ordered Lobster Tail to share warm or cold.  This was eventually sorted out, and our Lobster Tail did arrive warm with Drawn or Melted Butter.  But inexplicably the lobster did not reach our table until about 20 minutes after the Filet.  Miraculously the Filet stayed warm throughout this waiting period.  And the Lobster was sweet and worth waiting for.  Roasted Organic Mushrooms, thick Asparagus Spears, and a side of Classic Mac & Cheese with a 5-cheese blend and breadcrumbs enhanced a delicious meal that was topped off by custard-filled Donuts that were every bit as good as described by other reviewing Yelpers.  Good live music in the form of a singer and guitar player added to a pleasant and casual yet refined contemporary atmosphere.  To their credit, without any request for same, the manager and our waitress did take the Lobster Tail off the bill.     I was told that Onion Soup Gratinee will at some point return to the menu.  And my food was excellent enough to prompt a return.  A solid 4 stars overall, with 5 stars for the food alone!",

Misho took such great care of us and made great wine recommendations! I highly recommend the tuna poke for an appetizer. I had the scallops and the BF had the branzino. Both were absolutely delicious!!! For dessert Misho led us to the key lime pie and brought over a port dessert wine to pair it with.   We will definitely be going back soon!!   Great job Andiron the team!   P.S. Downtown Summerlin offers free valet and the drop off is right next door to Andiron! Score!!!",

    "text": "This place is nice. Expect to pay a pretty penny for your food. Is it worth it? For some things, yes. Other dishes, no.  We had a group of 6. And it took us 2 1/2 hours to dine. We were not sat for awhile due to missing one person. Once we got to our table, the waitress seemed overwhelmed. We kept having to get her attention just to order everything. Some drinks weren't getting to the table or some of the appetizers. They ended up giving us 2 drinks for free. She seemed much more calm after a minute. But there was about 4 different people serving us throughout the meal. It just didn't seem very organized. But the staff was very kind.  Most of the prices are pretty decent. We ended up paying about 92$ pp since we split the bill. This was for appetizers, dinner, dessert and drinks.  The dishes that were worth the price:  The polenta side. I know it's just a side, but it's topped with truffle and mushroom. It was the best polenta I've ever had. Insanely creamy and downright delightful.  The bacon on the blue cheese salad. So thick and flavorful.   My aged rib eye was very good. It was cooked perfectly and it was very flavorful. My husband's ribeye cap was overcooked and not so great. If it would have been cooked as asked (medium rare), it would have been much better.  Overall, this is a beautiful restaurant. I'm sure we'll go back. But with the craziness of the service and prices, it may be a minute.",

    "text": "First off, I still don't know how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. Sadly, none of the workers said the name of the restaurant while we dined and I was too embarrassed to ask. The world may never know.   I've been kind of bored and uninspired by the dining options at Downtown Summerlin as of late, since a lot of them fall in the 3 star or below category. Although I've heard great things about Andiron, it took me a while to make my way here. Luckily, a friend chose this place for her birthday brunch and WOW, their Sunday brunch is amazing. I highly recommend this place for a special event - the space itself is lofty, beautifully decorated and bright. Their floral motif that carries over onto their menu, plates, and wallpaper is tastefully done.   The brunch menu was impressive - a variety of savory and sweet dishes and for your inner child, there's a treat yo' self dessert bar. When I went it was filled with Lollipops, Smarties, Spree, Gummies, Fruit Loop marshmall treats, to-die-for ginger snaps and brownies. Going in a big group has its perks! Our large group decided to share a bunch of apps and entrees so I got to taste a bit of everything, and none of the dishes disappointed. My main entree was the short rib hash and the meat was very tender and tasty. My husband has never had a Bloody Mary, but their DIY all-you-can-drink Bloody Mary bar converted him. Fellow Yelper Regina I. was a Bloody Mary genius and was able to concoct some phenomenal combinations using the plethora of alcohol, hot sauces, and garnishes that were available. They also have bottomless mimosas, with more juice combinations aside from OJ and champagne.   As great as the food was and the service of the bartenders, hostesses, bartenders, DJ, etc., our dedicated server fell short and ruined the experience a bit for the birthday girl and the other guests who had service industry experience. I wasn't particularly upset since the atmosphere was fun. I had my back to the restaurant so I didn't see the goings on of everything, but other members of our party were commenting on the disorganized nature of the table service and how our server was handling tables far away from our table, which may have contributed to the lack of service. The rest of the table did get their alcoholic drinks way before me, but my non-alcoholic drink was forgotten and even when I reminded our server, she took awhile getting it. My entree was entered in wrong, so I had to wait bit longer as well (I was really trying to look on the positive side of things *cue Tyra Banks \"I was rooting for you\"  gif). Due to a lack of carafes, the grapefruit mimosa on one  side of the table was served in a large wine glass instead. Later on in the brunch, it was never replaced with a carafe, and when our server tried to pour a glass with it, spilled some on the birthday girl and another guest. I'm sure our server was just having a bad day, the experience wouldn't deter me from coming back here and confirming how to pronounce \"Andiron\" correctly.  Pro Tip - don't use valet - you'll stuff yourself crazy with their delicious treats that you'll want/need to walk to your car after.",

As soon as we walked in the Hostess greeted us, and sat us down. No wait, it was great! She informed us our server would be Misho, and he quickly arrived, and introduced himself. He mentioned the wine menu numerous times even after telling him we weren't interested in drinking. After declining the wine offer for the third time he was a bit rude throughout the night.   When it came to ordering our food he did not hesitate in giving his input. One of the guests in our party wanted a well-done steak and since Misho is also a meat connoisseur besides being a server he advised it was a terrible idea due to well-done meats being chewy, and that she \"would not like it. Trust me.\" In which we've tried many steak houses, and she has yet to come across a \"chewy\" well-done steak.   As the night progressed he rushed us in checking out, and only followed up with us once after having our meals served. The bus boy/assistant checked in on us more than our server did. It was pretty upsetting as we love this restaurant, and have had nothing but good experiences in the past until now.",

We made reservations ahead of time and they were ready for us when we arrived at 6:30. I wish I knew our waiters name because he was awesome. We drank lots wine and ate lots of food. They had many vegetable side dishes to chose from. I asked for a side salad, there wasn't one on the menu but the waiter said it wasn't a problem. My salad ended up being a huge delicious portion. We ordered a lot of steaks, a few orders of the scallops, and pretty much every app and side dish. Everyone cleaned their plates. We brought our own cake, the waiter brought it out with candles for us and then they sliced it in the back for us; no problems. I would definitely go back, it would make a lovely date spot.",

    "text": "I was a little disappointed. I had heard good things about Andiron and was interested in what I'd find when my friend suggested it for brunch.   Look and feel: I appreciated the restaurant style. I'm sure their patio is a fun place to be when the weather permits. The floral accents in uniforms, menu and tableware is noticeable and pretty.  Menu and presentation: The brunch menu was the perfect size; Not too many options, not to few. There was a good mix of sweet and savory. The presentation of the food had a simplistic, minimalist feel - very trendy. Who else can make fancy donuts holes look so kewl? An Instagram alley-oop. (Wish I had photos of the donuts, but only my sandwich *facepalm.*)  Taste: Although my presentation for my ham and eggs breakfast sandwich was a bit boring (plate was definitely too big), the fingerling potatoes were yummy and seasoned nicely. It came on a focaccia-type square bun (see photos) but super plain and a little overbearing to the yummy tastiness that was hiding inside. I was a little disappointed at first glance but opened the sandwich and found a treasure chest of a few more flavors. Still, as a whole, it wasn't a meal that makes me salivate or reminisce about. (Yes, I reminisce about previous meals, OK?!)   Bonus: Although they have what looks like a fun dessert menu, there is a \"candy bar\" which includes not only candy, but other treats like cocoa-puff-krispies, brownies, sugar cookies, etc. We certainly indulged (as a table) in this bottomless bonus after our meal. It is FREE for guests which is a point you can bet we clarified with our waiter multiple times. [Playfully:] \"So... you just go and get whatever you what?\" -- \"Yes, anything you want, it's for guests.\" -- \"So, free? We can go over as many times as we want?\" -- \"You can literally walk in, grab a brownie and leave, we wouldn't know.\" :P  I am not dying to go back, but I would be open to it and enjoyed my experience rather than the meal during this visit. For brunchers: If you enjoy flavorquests, try something OTHER than the ham and eggs sandwich.",

It came with a honey sauce which was so good. The chicken was crispy and tasty. The waffle was just okay. The sauce made all the difference I think. It was not too sweet, in my opinion it's a honey and hot sauce mixture. They also put arugula and a yellow colored veggie (cant remember what it was). My friend ordered an omelette which she was not too fond of.  I want to see the place for dinner and try their dinner menu.",

My 8oz filet was probably closer to 7oz and fetched $45 bucks.  The wife enjoyed a well prepared crusted salmon for $30 bucks.   All the sides are al a carte and seemed to be the worst value.  Mashed Potatoes at $7, sweet potato fries at $7, roasted cauliflower at $8.     Will I return?   Probably not as I think there are spots just as beautiful but a better value.   Will I advise against going here?  Probably not as it wasn't a bad experience and it is a good location to attend a movie after.",

For brunch, it was pretty busy with a 1 hour wait on a Sunday. Luckily, we had Jim as our waiter who made our afternoon well worth it. Our table all ordered the bottomless mimosas for $19 with the sage and grapefruit option. Jim was kind enough to even bring us a couple of carafes of straight champagne to avoid using too much juice.  As for the food, I'd say all of our options were on the average side. The candy bar was a little minimal during the time we were there as well. All in all, the good deal for mimosas and the great service made me enjoy my visit.",

The place was close to empty, it was not busy at all.  5 minutes later, we decided to just leave.  As we were walking out, the waitress apologized and said that she was busy with other customers, which was a lie but that's OK.  Then as we walked away, the host said \"don't be afraid of the $ sign\"  Very condescending and down right racist (we were the only non-white customer at the time of this incident).

While we were eating, I noticed we weren't given any silverware or napkins except a mini fork for the oysters.   My second visit, I randomly wanted to pop in for a couple dozen oysters. Of course, we were not dress for the occasion and I felt again not very welcomed by the staff.   Make sure you dress up a little bit or else you'll get the what are doing in here face.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this restaurant after my husband hosted a business dinner there and brought home some delicious leftovers.  I had heard from a few friends that the food was great, but the service was not up to par.  We decided to give it a go anyway.   We went on Friday night at 7, and it was not overly busy.  The restaurant itself is very visually appealing.  It's very open and I loved the decor.  There are large windows everywhere and the kitchen is visible through windows that divide the dining room from the kitchen. They had live music which was great.    We sat at the bar first and ordered 2 of the specialty cocktails.  It took 3 bartenders about 10 minutes to bring the first cocktail, which was mine, and then my husbands drink took about another 10 minutes. Apparently, only one bartender (the one working the service well) was able to make my husbands drink so we had to wait until she was available to make it.  It was a fall \"yam\" old fashioned.  When she poured the drink into a martini glass from the shaker, right in front of us at the bar, the drink looked short and she shook the shaker very hard to get every last drop out, which made a little mess and spilled some of the drink on the bar.    None of the 3 bartenders were engaging or friendly.    We went to the dining room next to have dinner.  Our server greeted us quickly and went over the specials.  There were only 2 specials, a truffle risotto and an au gratin potato side dish, which our server had to read from his notes to tell us about.   I thought maybe he might be new and didn't mind this, but I did think it a little odd considering all of the other fine dining restaurants and even more casual places I have been too where servers have memorized 6 or 7 specials.  This didn't hinder my experience though.  When our server came back to take our order, we had decided on our appetizers but were still debating on our entrees, so I asked him if he could please put in our app order and then come back in a few minutes so we could decide on our entrees.  He got a little spastic and said, \"I'm trying to not send too many tickets to the kitchen and I want to put your order in all on one ticket so I don't want to put your appetizer in without your entree\".  My husband and I were both dumbfounded when he said this.  I have never been to a restaurant where a server acted this way and started to ramble about kitchen tickets to me.  We felt pressured to decide on our entrees immediately and aggravated that he rushed our decision.  Ultimately, it was because he was too lazy to have to worry about entering the the second course of our meal at a later time which would require him watching our appetizer progress and timing when to fire our second course to ensure a good flow for our dinner.  The appetizers were both very good.  The corn chowder and the burrata with figs were delicious. The bread with salted butter they brought was also delicious.   What ruined our experience the most was when our entrees came out before we were even finished enjoying our appetizers.  I was in the restroom and my husband had to hurry up and finish the apps so they could take the plates and serve us our dinner.  I still had half a glass of white wine that I hadn't finished yet and I wanted to order a glass of red to have with my entree, but since the courses were so rushed, I didn't even bother.  We like to have a relaxing dinner pace and enjoy each course with wine pairings and this was not an option here.  We shared a filet, which was your average filet that you could get at any steak place.  The sauces, peppercorn and chimichurri were both very tasty. The Mac and cheese waffle, that was touted as a \"must have\" by the server and, we were told, was featured on the food network, was disappointing.  It was very dry and basically tasted like cheesy, toasted bread.  The other side we had was the mushrooms, which were very tasty.   The best part of the meal, by far was the dessert.  The creme brulee donuts are to die for!  Absolutely delicious!  We talked to both the server and the manager about the issues we had and they were both very apologetic about the rushed pace of our meal.  They sent a dessert because it was our anniversary.  It was the lemon meringue tart.  We both had a taste and it was good.  However, we already ordered the dessert we really wanted, the donuts, and did not need another one as we were already very full.  In my opinion, they should have comped the dessert of our choice if that's what they were planning to do, instead of sending out something we didn't want and were unable to eat.  I did appreciate that they did send something and that they were apologetic about our concerns.  I would try this restaurant again as I think the chef is very creative and the food is good.  The ambiance is great too.  They just need to improve the level of skill and customer service of their staff to bring it up to par with the food quality.",

    "text": "I've always meant to create a Yelp account, but haven't had a recent dining experience good or bad enough to warrant the time to create an account until now. Andiron had every opportunity to be a decent steakhouse but fell short in every category.  Too Long; Didn't Read:  Cons     - Poor meat quality     - Terrible service     - Management that saw an unhappy customer, acknowledged that there was a problem, and did nothing to fix it.     - Extremely overpriced.     - \"Family\" portions (at family prices) that are really meant for individuals  Pros     - Excellent French Onion Soup      - A creative take on a \"Mac & Cheese Waffle\"  Located adjacent to the Downtown Summerlin outdoor mall, the Andiron restaurant was recommended to my family through a work friend (further recommendations will be taken with a grain of salt) who claimed it was worth a try.  We drove out to celebrate my mom's birthday, and on arrival we were impressed with the modern appearance of the restaurant and sharp attire of the waitstaff, but aside from aesthetics the experience was down hill from there.  We made the reservation stating that it was my mom's birthday, and while I was glad the waitstaff didn't come together and chant a silly song and disrupt our dinner, I was surprised at the lack of even a simple happy birthday wish. Had that been the greatest folly of the service I would have written it off as not worth mentioning, but when the rest of the service throughout the meal failed to meet even basic standards, I felt it was fair to give my full opinion. Drinks were few and far between, not ordering a sealed bottle of water meant not getting any water at all, and it seems iced tea was a commodity so rare that refilling our glasses was too much to ask.  We started with appetizers, all getting and enjoying the French Onion soup, and then moved on to the entree's. I personally got a \"prime\" New York Strip, dad got a bone-in fillet, and mom went on a limb trying a Ribeye Cap, a cut of meat I'm not familiar with but will note as \"the last cut of meat that can be categorized as a ribeye before being considered unworthy of selling.\"  The steaks were were extremely disappointing in both flavor and appearance, the sides (aside from the Mac & Cheese Waffle, though a bit salty for my taste) were standard at best, and the management's reactions to a clearly unhappy table were abysmal. The waiter asked how our meal was, we replied that we were disappointed, he apologized, asked if we needed anymore tea, and then went on what I assume was a trip around the block to hunt for the elusive pitcher of iced-tea.   20 minutes later the tea showed up along with the evening manager (Andrew I believe), who understood that our experience was sub-standard but was unwilling to offer any sort of solution, I suspect because we didn't demand anything from him. Instead of getting upset and making a scene we simply told him the meal was disappointing and that we wanted the check so we could leave. Another 20 minutes later he came back, asked if everything was alright (time doesn't heal wounds that quickly), we said no, he gave us the check, we paid, and left. Any respectable restaurant staff would have tried to make amends. I'm not looking for a free meal, but when the meal is my mother's birthday I expect an apology at the bare minimum.  I will not return to the Andiron, and have such strong a opinion about the restaurant that I will go out of my way to urge my friends and colleagues to do the same. If you want to spend $75 a person on bad steaks and terrible service while under the guise of thinking the valet full of Mercedes out front makes the bill worth it, good for you.   If you'd rather spend a quarter of the amount and enjoy a good meal, try the BJ's Pub on Charleston if you live in Summerlin, or a much more fairly priced (and extremely better steak) at the Twincreeks Steakhouse in the Silverton Casino on Blue Diamond and I15 South if you're father south in the city. Or run to Sam's Club and pick up a steak there, I suspect the cut of meat from their butcher will be better than anything you are served by the cooks at the Andiron.",

However, the staff greeted us warmly and gave us the royal treatment despite our attire.  We looked over the menu, and realized this dinner was going to be pretty pricey. Every item on the menu is a la carte. However, I must say, everything we ordered was excellent. Our party consisted of 4 adults & 3 kids. I had a skirt steak while my husband had a fish entree. We ordered a side of shrimp scampi and organic mushrooms. It was one of the best meals we've ever had and we try a lot of restaurants. Our friends agreed with us.  The service was excellent and they had live dinner music. I only wished we dressed up more. This is a \"must go to\" restaurant.",

The Mac & cheese waffle was cold and dried out and barely cheesy - the staff told me I was supposed to pour the extra cheese sauce in it to make it creamy. It was served like a breakfast waffle, uncut, on an ugly blue plate. Seriously unappetizing.   The bacon wrapped matzoh balls were equally \"off\"... Very salty and the horseradish creme fraiche only helped a little. The best part of our meal was the asparagus, cooked just right, on what I believe was supposed to be a romesco sauce was more like a red pepper paste... A serious disappointment.   The fried chicken around the corner was EXCELLENT!",

    "text": "It makes me supremely proud that my 200th review is on a new restaurant that I am wholeheartedly giving FIVE stars!  I have eaten here twice now.  This is a very fancy restaurant in the new Downtown Summerlin complex.  It's like birthday dinner/anniversary dinner expensive; it's not really just for a Saturday night date.  It is a SPECIAL place.  The first time I went, my husband and I got a bunch of little small plates and shared them to try them out.  The one thing I noticed about many of the dishes was the overwhelming taste of horseradish.  It was in THREE of our dishes.  Now, I like horseradish, so I didn't mind, but I will say there was a LOT of it.  Here's what we got: - The bread at this restaurant apparently changes often.  The day we went, it was a pop-over (I think that's what it was called).  It was like this huge cloud that was completely airy in the middle.  This is a horrible description of what it looks like, but I can't seem to describe it correctly!  It came with a horseradish-y butter. - Half dozen oysters that came with a shallot-y red wine vinaigrette sauce.  Tasty little buggers and nicely sized. - Steak tartare.  This was one of the dishes with the horseradish.  Beautifully presented with a quail egg in the middle.  The meat was cut into nice sized chunks so you could really get a good texture to it. - The wedge salad.  The bacon on this thing was out-of-this-world good.  It was the thickest, juiciest bacon I may have ever eaten.  Surprisingly, with all the horseradish in the other dishes, the bleu cheese dressing on this salad had none that I could taste!  Huh, that's where I would expect some horseradish. - Bacon-wrapped matzo balls.  I was most excited by this app when we ordered, but it ended up being my least favorite of the night.  There was something about the matzo balls' texture that just seemed a little off to me, and I didn't think the cream sauce that came with it (read: horseradish) went well with the app. - Farro risotto.  Nicely nutty farro.  There were dates in this dish, so every now and then, I'd be like, \"Ohhhh, there's something sweet in here!  I've got to eat another bite!\" because it was so surprising.  The second time I went by myself because I couldn't stop thinking about this Santa Barbara Seafood Pot that I had seen on the menu the first time.  And it was delightful.  A mixture of shrimp, rock fish, mussels, clams, and the most perfect scallops.  The broth was flavorful, and the crusty bread was perfect for dipping.  A side note to end the review: the wallpaper, menus, bread plates, and even the ties that the servers wear all have the same floral print.  It is a neat little element that just ties the whole restaurant together.  Andiron is a fabulous addition to Summerlin!",

I had gristle at one end of the steak and had to leave many tiny chewed up bits on my plate. Whoever removed my plate looked down at it and no doubt registered that it was inedible meat. i think that the chefs need to pay attention to what they're serving because the price tag did not guarantee a good steak. I cooked a better steak sous vide a few days later at home! Maybe next time I'll choose the \"sea\" and get a better dinner.",

We started with Cesar salad and the French onion soup. Perfection. Perfect with a glass of champagne.  Then I enjoyed a Stubborn as a Mule cocktail made exactly as it should, with crushed ice in a copper mug.  Dinner was a duck breast (the special) for my husband, and the most perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye cap for myself. The crust on the steak was better then we could do ourselves. We paired our dinner with melt in your mouth mashed potatoes, and the most incredible creamed spinach. We were happily satisfied, but then came dessert.... Lemon tart was amazing with the perfect meringue on top, the donuts with cream brulee inside that I couldn't stop eating and the chocolate molten cake with peanut butter swirled ice cream. Oh my goodness, it was heavenly.  From the staff, to the chef, you are incredible. I love this place, and you have a fan,",

It can be awkward to bring a 5 year old into such a nice place... Anyway this was not the case! They both complimented her and chatted with her as if she was just another regular person. The waitstaff was the same! All were so very very nice and my glass never was empty thanks the the poor water guy who filled it at least 8 times!   Food: although they were out of the cut of steak I had plans of ordering (which was odd because it had just opened for the day when we arrived), I ordered the New York strip. It was awesome, the delicious crunch of the char from the grill was just perfect and my steak was cooked to the perfect medium I had asked for. The shallots were delicious and sweet perfect pair for my steak! We also ordered the famous Mac and cheese waffle, need I say more?!? It was so perfectly cheesy and crisp, my moth waters just thinking about it. Anyway, we also had the donuts filled with custard for dessert. I personally usually hate custard but there was something about it that it was yummy. Not too sweet and not to liquidy, just right for the inside of a delicious donut that had sugar that was almost perfectly caramelized just outside the dough. Defiantly want to go back for the waffle and donuts again, just as a girls date with my mom and sisters!",

The environment is very clean. Walls are draped with white and the tables are set very minimally with nice floral accents. The menu is quite small, and as our first time attending the restaurant, we were a little talks back with the prices at first. But, after realizing that this place really knows their meats, and that we are also located in Downtown Summerlin, we figured it was then fitting. They also had a live singer near the entrance, which I LOVED. She was so good. (I waived on the way out and my husband made fun of me... )  I ordered the skirt steak ($30) and added on shrimp scampi ($15 for 3 pieces of shrimp) and I must say that I was very impressed. The meal came in a timely manner, and had very good seasoning and taste. The meat was very moist and tender, while the shrimp charred and grilled to perfection.   I honestly was most impressed with our servers. They were all so knowledgable when it came to the cuts of meat and where they were cut from the animal. They also give very vivid descriptions of how the sauces and dishes taste.   The only reason it gets a 4, is that although the experience was memorable, the food really wasn't for me. It tasted great and everything, but I wasn't blown away... Especially for the prices that we paid. It's definitely a very nice \"date\" restaurant, and perfect for a night out in Downtown Summerlin.",

The pea soup was just okay, but the ingredients were fresh enough and overall it was okay, I mean it's pea soup after all. The shrimp was also just okay, and the portion size was pretty small.  For mains we had the steak and the chicken. The steak was pretty good, though again the cut was on the small side, and thin. The chicken, however was a large portion, which was unfortunate because it was awful. It was served on top of some over cooked carelessly seasoned brocollini, (I say careless because for the most part it was blandly seasoned if at all, but a few bites were terribly salty) the chicken itself was cumbersome and difficult to eat, as it kept sliding around on top of the brocollini as we cut into it to eat it. The skin was burnt tasting, yet soggy, and totally under seasoned and flavorless. We barley touched this dish.  For desert we had the creme brulee donuts and the lemon tart. This was probably the best course, though the lemon tart was very sour, though tasty. The creme brulee donuts were also delicious, but the portion was tiny (two small ping pong ball sized donuts in one portion.   This all would have been a 3.5 star experience (I really loved this place last time we were here) but it took them over 40 minutes to cash us out, which was extremely irritating. Overall it was a lackluster, expensive experience that will make us think twice about coming back.",

    "text": "There seems to be a trend in Hometown Vegas (this is what I like to call the area that is not the Strip or Downtown tourist spaces ... where Vegas residents actually live and play), especially around Summerlin/Peccole Ranch area, where hip new restaurants pop up and momentarily become the hotspot for the trendy crowd.  And AS&S seems priced to take advantage of this ...  My wife and I were looking for a nice dining experience and we'd heard this place was from the makers of Honey Salt (a place I haven't reviewed here but we absolutely love!).  First, the best part of our evening was by the Service and the atmosphere.  Our waiter and supporting staff were super friendly and timely all night.  This is a crew that clearly has the chops to handle the high maintenance fine dining crowd, but were down-to-earth enough to put up with the likes of me.  And just like Honey Salt, they nailed it on making a visually stunning and very comfortable restaurant.  The food was also very good.  I had the Dry Aged 12 oz Rib Eye to which I added the Wood Grilled Shrimp.  My wife had the Prime Angus FlatIron and added the truffle compound butter.  We shared sides of asparagus and the mac&cheese waffle because ... well ... because Mac&Cheese Waffle!!  Everything was prepared well and tasted good.  The truffle compound butter was very good!  There was almost nothing disappointing about this meal ...   Almost ...   My sole complaint and reason for the 3 Stars is simply value.  If you are going to drop $200 on dinner and cocktails for two, you want to come way feeling like the food and experience were on par with the price.  The steaks, while good, were not quite at the level you'd expect to justify the $30 price tag.  The add-ons also seemed overpriced and underwhelming.  I don't count myself among those who get any personal benefit out of paying a premium for the sake of being seen paying a premium, so whatever additional value was supposed to be there for this price was definitely missing.",

The reservation was right on time, and we were seated right away.  The food was also good, not great, but 4 star on just that portion.  The problem was the service, and the server in general.  The first turnoff was the water - would we like still or sparkling?   Really, not even offering tap water?  Server was very pushy, and at the beginning was trying to rush us.  Once the drinks game, she said she would be right back to take our order, and it was at least 15 minutes.  On the return, we were only told about the specials at that time, and were clearly expected to make a snap decision.  Many times we requested refills, more water, etc, and the server or water person would leave before we would finish speaking, and we would have to wait to order the other's drinks.  Empty glasses stood on our table the entire meal.  At one point I counted 6 empties, and there were not cleared until just before dessert.  We will not return.",

    "text": "With a number of great steak restaurants in Vegas, I had high hopes that Andiron would be one I could add to our list.  Unfortunately it let us down in the most critical area- the quality of the steaks.  I ordered the dry aged prime ribeye and my wife ordered the Waygu Tritip- recommended by our waitress as being very tender.  We ordered them medium, after being informed that would be more like medium rare.  We also got their Caesar salad and double stuffed potato.  The salad and potato were very good.  Both of our steaks were tough by any reasonable standard, and my wife's was delivered quite rare.  We sent my wife's back to get it cooked to medium.  My ribeye was a surprisingly thin cut, but cooked properly- yet still tough.  When my wife's was finally brought back, it was properly cooked but very tough.  It should be noted that the service was very good.  My wife posted a review on TripAdvisor.  The next day, a managing partner sent her a message in which he apologized, and hoped our experience would not keep us from coming back.  Really?  We spent $162 for the poor experience and he expected an apology would be sufficient to bring us back.",

    "text": "Best steakhouse west of the strip with ease.  First, the place looks great let's get that out of the way. Nice open space and a great decor make it very inviting. It has a fairly upscale feel but the restaurant is still very casual. The blend works.  In reality this place is really a 4.5 but since we are confined to whole numbers I was feeling generous. The half a star knock goes to the bread. It is, for lack of a better way to describe it, not good. I'd hesitate to call it bread because it's close to yorkshire pudding but nowhere near as good as that. It had similar consistency and crunch but it just didnt really work. Butter was awesome though so I ate all the bread anyways because butter nom nom nom  -Avocado Toast. This was way better than it should have been. A very generous amount of avocado per piece of toast coupled with some amazingly flavorful tomatoes made this one of the better light appetizers I've had in a while. I can imagine some saying it's not flavorful enough and yeah I'll admit it's not decadent. But the natural flavors are there, you just have to be paying attention.  -Bacon wrapped matzo balls. Ah the most beautiful oxymoron I've seen in a while. Maybe it's the Jew in me wanting to be naughty but this thing tasted incredibly good. The horseradish creme fraiche was DOPE.  -Rib cap. Look this steak was just really good. Cooked exactly how I wanted and seasoned very well too. No it's not the best steak Ive had in Vegas but it's definitely the best one I've had off strip and for only $34 I consider that a steal.  -Roasted brussel sprouts. These were pretty good. Not mind blowing but as far as Im concerned as long as you make brussel sprouts edible it means they were done right as we've all eaten brussel sprouts that we could have lived without at one point in our lives.  -Rum cake. God yes give me more. The cake was amazing, the pineapples super sweet, the streusel so sugary, and the sobert perfect. That bite you get with all the components put together was one of the best things I've had in a while.  This is more than a good restaurant this is a repeat over and over kind of place. If you want steak but not the hassle of the strip, this is the place.",

The complimentary corn bread (warm and buttery) and whipped butter was to die for also.   Main course: Ordered their surf & turf special which was a good size rib eye with jumbo garlic prawns. Also ordered the burrata and grilled figs.  This was an interesting salad.  Never had burrata and it looked like marscapone cheese.  It was actually more of a softer mozzarella consistency served with brown turkey figs drizzled with honey.  Their golden Yukon mash potatoes were really creamy and savory too.  Dessert: I finished with the creme brulee donuts, but they didn't come out hot and fresh so it was a little disappointing.  Other than that everything else was great! Definitely will be back.",

My kids had a blast visiting their candy bar which is complimentary for kids 10 and under.

Our server Ryan was very good and made sure our glasses were always full. One of my friends tried the unlimited create your own Bloody Mary fo $24, if you like Bloody Mary, this is a Must try.  Food was great, we had avocado toast (highly recommend), grown up grilled cheese served with ham, gruyere cheese and sunny side egg, chilaquiles. For sides we had wood grilled thick cut bacon and breakfast potatoes. I think these were the best breakfast potatoes ever! Crisped to perfection potatoes perfect temperature with onions and peppers, yummmy!!  My kids enjoyed cheese burger, bit pricy for a kids meal $15 a piece but it was huge! Don't forget to check in with yelp and claim a free dessert!! I had their donuts which were amazing (thank you yelp!!) We also tried lemon meringue pie which was delicious. Overall a great place for brunch, nice ambiance and DJ!",

We were seated and the lovely lady served us some water and stated that our server would be right with us. We sat there patiently waiting for 25 minutes before we finally got up and asked the wonderful hostess who our server was. Shortly after that a server came to our table and took our drink and food orders. He did not seem to have any knowledge of the menu. After struggling to take our order, we then waited for ANOTHER 45 MINUTES until our food arrived half cold and under cooked and other parts over cooked. It wasn't just us. We witness several other tables get up to ask wtf and also sitting there for long periods of time with no food or drinks or any service at all. The owners really need to take control of this disaster or Andiron will go the way of the Dodo. I have read a lot of the other reviews and they all state the same thing. For such a nice place, you think the service would be better. Literally the easiest thing to fix and it's not being fixed.

Which is only beneficial for drinks . We pretty much ordered most of our meal from the bar menu & spent a decent price including drinks for both of us! They served us complimentary wine and dessert since we were celebrating an event. The size is small but you will be surprised! Definitely got my moneys worth, i would love to try their brunch sometime!   *Pictured - Champagne  - Mac&cheese waffle: so yum! Can definitely taste the mac & cheese so im assuming the waffle part is it being grilled on a waffle griddle?  - Cilantro lime wings: i love wings & their ranch has dill, loved it even more! - Calamari: small wish it was bigger but the sauce paring was excellent - Lobster Roll: might be my favorite, i love lobster rolls. It is small & came with 2 we each shared 1 the bread was perfect & the amount of lobster/shrimp/crab was wholesome - Regular mule: i love the power of the ginger beer we have been on a mule kick lately - Pineapple blump: pineapple juice was good, i loved it and its presentation - Donuts: custard filled its so good by this time i was so full but its amazing",

The overall ambience of the place is nice, but was disappointed in food quality for price. I ordered a pork chop that hardly had any flavor and was tough. I was barely able to cut through it with the steak knife provided! My husband ordered a steak filet. When you're paying $50 for a steak, you wouldn't expect tater tots as the side. Wouldn't recommend and will not be returning.",

    "text": "0n 01/13/18 I visited Andiron. The best service was received by the hostess and the second-helper - who should have been a server.. The server Misho was only interested in the tables buying wine or alcohol.   While I had a great experience on my first visit, I can see that the service level and food quality is not consistent. While I did choose to speak to the manager prior to leaving, the remedy of coming back and letting them \"take care of me\" on a return visit is not likely to happen - because why go back and deal with that hassle? I wasn't at Andiron for a \"free meal\" I was there to have a great experience and celebrate. The embarrassing part was that the restaurant was empty for the most part. Very few tables and our server had only 2.  The great part of the meal was the scallops - cooked perfectly. My steak was ordered and I specifically stated that I want the steak well-done, no pink, and cooked throughout without being burnt. This is a steakhouse, you would think they could cook a well-done steak?   The server warned that this would mean a longer wait for our meals, to which I told him that I understood an extended time to prepare my well-done steak.  My steak was served medium rare. I waited 5 minutes to flag down our server, and he rushed it to the back. 5 minutes later he came back and the steak was now medium-well and very pink. He offered to take it back again and cook the same steak more. At this point I actually asked for a box, and packed it to go because we were finished with our meal.  At no point prior to me asking for the manager from the hostess, on the way out, did anyone make any attempt to solve this issue or refund the steak that the couldn't figure out how to cook.",

We didn't have to wait, seated right away, the restaurant was half empty. The decor is very nice, but not sure what they are going for here. There was loud club type music playing. I got a drink called Midnight Rambler, very good and  my husband got a some bourbon. For  our meals we got the Cowboy Ribeye, side of Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and Pan Seared Salmon. Everything was very good, we had no complaints, cooked perfectly. Desert looked good but we skipped it. Our waiter service was good, he didn't go out of the way to make us feel special but he did his job. The prices are a bit high IMO, that will probably keep us from going back.",

    "text": "After a so so experience at Honey Salt, I wasn't expecting much from Andiron. However, it actually turned out great. Our server, Jose was super nice and accommodating. I wasn't happy with the steak sauce and instead of asking me which one I would like instead, he brought out a sample of all of them. Now that is True customer service.   Lobster rolls are usually under seasoned to let the lobster flavor shine but I've always disagreed with anything bland. Here they seasoned it very well so it was great! We also had the octopus which was cooked perfectly tender and had the right amount of char. For the entree's we had the branzino and rib eye. The fish was cooked and deboned perfectly. It's not often where I don't find a single bone in fish that I order. The rib eye was also cooked perfectly medium rare. You have no idea how many steakhouses cannot get the temperature of their steak right. I was just at Echo and Rig few days ago and the steak was raw in the center when I asked for medium rare. I sent it back and when it came back only half of it was medium rare. The other half was still raw. Anyway, needless to say I have really happy when my steak came out perfectly medium rare. Out of all the sauces, peppercorn was my favorite.  We finished with the creme brulee donuts. It had the perfect crunch on the outside and creamy filling on the inside.   Great service, great food. Will be back soon!",

The chilaquiles were the best part of the meal, but I felt the chicken was an unnecessary component and had no flavor. The mac n cheese was really good but super rich. Overall very good meal!

    "text": "We tried the Andiron based on the 2017 Thrillist recommendation as best steakhouse off the strip. We have had exactly one great meal in exactly one visit with only limited exploration of the menu. I'll update the review as we return.  Based on the server's recommendation, we shared the chef's special of day: a 32 oz dry aged Tomahawk steak which came with fingerling potatoes, roast red peppers and 2 sides for $89.  I ordered the steak at 130 degrees, True medium rare, to give the chef confidence to cook exactly to target temperature. We chose the Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese for sides.   The steak was cooked perfectly with a nicely seasoned crust and perfectly medium rare though the steak; there was no subsurface overcooked meat and no color gradient through the depth, thanks to a sous vide sear or reverse sear technique. The steak came with four sauces: a  chimichurri, a bernaise, a simple tomato based barbecue and green peppercorn sauce; all were good, but the meat was perfect with its salt and pepper seasoning.  The mac and cheese was creamy and had a nice mix of four cheeses - nice homestyle comfort food. The roasted brussels sprouts were crisp and brown under a contrasting, sweet glaze.  The server, busboy and manager (perhaps owner?) were all attentive without being intrusive. The manager was especially pleased to hear that the steak had been ordered to a specific temperature.  The space has pleasant Restoration Hardware feel and the music was pleasant funky jazz (not loud EDM as a previous reviewer reported).  We'll be back.",

Considering the price they were charging I was expecting more. Very disappointed with the steak, I've had better at other steak restaurants. The Lobster tail was delicious tho. Nothing really impressed me too much but the layout of the place. It also took a while to receive our food. Considering it was Valentines Day and there was a set menu, it took too long. Only 3 stars for me, maybe cause my expectations were high and they didn't reach it.",

I think our server may have had too many tables because there was a bit of lag time however I won't say he gave bad service.   Harlan was very attentive and did make sure to check on us as much as he could.  He even made sure everything I had was gluten free.   The food was pretty darn good as well.   I didn't have one thing that I would not want to have again.   Also, I'd love to try a lot more now that I know it's so darn delicious.   They brought my mom out a birthday dessert and made it so I could have done by bringing the gluten free one.  Don't forget about the candy bar as you're leaving.

    "text": "We came here looking for a nice steakhouse. Seems that we will continue looking. :(  Valet attendant  was friendly, although not needed for us.  The tables are nice and I can see them trying to set a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.   My reasons include first and foremost the menu!! The seafood was very limited. The Figi water was offered and that was a plus, however we needed to eat as well.  Okay, so my Mom could not get the seafood she desired. Moving on,  EVERYTHING on the menu is a-la- carte! Our group had a total of 6 people, so a small slab of mashed potatoes at $8.00 a pop is $48.00 in potatoes alone!! If you cut the carbs and go with the brussel sprouts it's about the same!! What if you get both?! Plus the entree, we'll you can imagine the bill NOT including the drinks!!  I have been fortunate to frequent some very nice restaurants in my lifetime and this isn't one of them. NO OCEAN, NO VIEW, NO REASON for me to return.  I recommend finding a True steakhouse based on a great variety of good food and service that takes the sting outta the bill! Just my OPINION.",

The decor is just lovely: all classic modern simple chic with walls of What can only be described as \"tacky dark blue with multi colored flowers\"- like a wallpaper you would never have in your house, but it goes well with the gray and white tables.  Prices were kinda high: but this is a steak and seafood place. Wouldnt really recommend the regular food here because their biggest steal is the happy hour, although I have been here for the regular food as well.  - Jalapeno Churros: Not suggested- bland with just the taste of Spice -Truffle Melt- Beef was overcooked and pretty expensive for a small sized burger Happy Hour is everyday from 5-7pm and the food happy hour on Tuesdays is all day THis includes:  1) 1$ oysters 2) 1/2 off wines by the glass, specialty cocktails and beer  Hours are interesting: 10-2:30, then opens back up at 5:00-10:30pm Although I have been there past 10:30pm on a Tuesday Night  Oysters are def what I come here for and what I continue coming here for- There is never a wait as soon as I get off from work:  1$ oysters are usually from the West Coast but it all depends on the Season because it can come from the East Coast. I particularly like this place because the Oysters are small to medium size and have light to medium salinity, although I have had some high Salinity ones. On a good night my husband and I will come here and order and eat 40+ oysters. All Oysters are served with lemon, fresh seaweed( yes it is live cause I thought it was plastic until i broke a piece off and ate it). Also served with chopped shallots in what seems like a red wine vinaigrette. Absolutely Amazing combination. They also if you would like they have hot sauce.",

I loved how clean and airy it looked.   The service was great as well. Our waiter was attentive and accommodating.  Food:  Calamari - nothing special but the aioli gave it life   The power lunch had a 3-course option and comes all together, which is great for someone rushing for work but wants a decent lunch. I had mixed feelings about that because I didn't want my steak to get cold while I was eating my soup.   Anyways, I picked the carrot soup, petit filet served with seasonal veggies  and creme brulee donut.   I was concerned when it said Petit Filet lol but it was a decent size. They did a good job seasoning the filet, I didn't need a sauce!   The star of the show was the Creme brulee Donut - Clever little twist to a classic. The creme was a nice surprise to bite into, definitely needed more than one!   Enjoyed everything about this place!",

The service from everyone was excellent, and everyone seems to have a good sense of humor. The cornbread they brought out before the meal was great! Just sweet and crumbly enough to not be a cake, like many other places. I ordered the Corn Soup for the first course, the Hanger Steak for the second, the Creme Brulee Donuts for dessert. The soup was good, but was unfortunately forgotten once the next course was served. It looked very pretty, though. The hanger steak was a perfect medium rare, and was extremely tender. It had a good flavor that was enhanced by the steak sauce that was served on the side. The creme brulee donuts were out of this world! I'm not a huge sweets person, but I could eat these all of the time. They aren't overly sweet, and the texture is genius. There is a very light candied sugar shell on the outside that gives a very slight crunch at the beginning. I'd come back in a heartbeat!",

Aside from the adorable chic upscale interior, they have a wide selection on all their menus. Rose Fridays got my attention and ended up here to give it another try.  I saw the advertisement for 'Rose Fridays from 11am-close.' This is False. They close to turn over the restaurant at 2pm but reopen at 4pm when you can indulge.   At 3:59pm we were sitting down and by 4pm we each had a glass of rose in hand. The waitress was beyond amazing and felt like one of your best girlfriends; so bubbly & easy to connect with. She truly understands hospitality.   5pm the kitchen opened & of course my eyes are bigger than my stomach and caught myself ordering an endless amount of food; oysters, black truffle tries, burrata, crispy artichokes to name a few. Everything was perfectly prepared. After 4 hours of sipping and slurping (my oysters that is) my negative experience of Andiron has become positive. I can't wait to come back & fully dive into the menu.   Until then, you can catch me at Happy Hour! Cheers!",

Everything was fantastic from the bloody mary bar, to the food, and the people. The staff was friendly and shared in our excitement and congratulations.

Looking at the menu was quit overwhelming, I mean, in a good way.  Everything sounds so good, it was so hard to decide what to order, from the appetizers to entrees to desserts. We went during brunch time, and usually there aren't a lot of options that I would try, but everything seemed unique and delicious. Luckily my friends and I want to order several items and taste each other's order.  For starters, we tried the donut hole sampler and lobster rolls, thick-cut bacon. The donuts are definitely a must-try.  For my main dish, I had the yummy short ribs. After brunch, we came to the conclusion that we just have to go back to try the other dishes!",

After an hour of waiting, I received a med steak, cold mac and cheese and raw asparagus. It was rather an expensive meal too. I consider myself having a pretty good taste for steak, but this was not worth the money. The bearnaise sauce tasted too tart.  On the other hand, the drinks were crafted well. I ordered a dry vodka martini with blue cheese olives and it was made with great attention and care...one of the best I had in a while.   I do not recommend this place strictly to the prices  or being on par with the quality.",

Let's start with the atomsphere...gorgeous! Soothing colors yet a hip vibe gave the place a very upscale but not at all stuffy feel like some other high-end steakhouses have.  Elizabeth Blau stopped by the table herself and commented on how the didn't want to be like other steak houses.  The nailed it!  The food...really amazing! Started with the fig and burrata app.  It was like a fresh breath of spring.  Light and creamy.  I had the Waygu Skirt and hubby had the Bone-in filet.  Both flavorful and perfectly cooked. I liked the variety of steaks and preparations on the menu.    Could leave without trying dessert...Lemon tart with the most amazing barely lime meringue and the carrot cake...moist and fantatstic.  I just want more of the vanilla sauce though.    I love restaurants where it's not just about the food....its an experience.  Andiron is just that. Its the total package..an incredible experience.

Tonight's dinner was a amazing experience, that is the primary reason people go out to dine, right. The Experience and Good Food n Wine.  All three categories, Andiron Steak & Sea hits the bulls eye.  From the ever start, a warm welcome greets you into amazing appointed restaurant, with chic bar area on your right and dinning straight up. As we were seated our server promptly and politely introduced himself and showcased their specials. We were in a mood for seafood, so he recommended the perfect balance meal for two of us. My wife ordered the white fish (similar of Bass) and I orders the salmon with smoked asparagus for sides. To share, appetizers, our server recommended nueske bacon wrapped matzo balls which was accompanied with corn bread.  One by one our food was being served, in a timely manner. Bacon wrapped matzo balls, were just perfect, well backed inside with crispy bacon wrapped around. We cleaned it out in 5 mins tops. I wanted to order a second portion, but my wife said we must wait for the entree. And boy she was right.  The salmon was one of the finest I have had in Las Vegas, well presented crispy top garnished with crackling onions and herbs supported with artichokes. Wow, Chef had done a spectacular   job, it was divine. My wife, dish was better, according to here. Both to were very distinct flavors, perfectly done and well presented. All this with polite service and ambience that is chic and royal in a way. Andiron steak and sea, will be our top five Las Vegas restaurant defiently the best outside the strip. We will be back and I recommend this location to not only locals but tourist too.  Only one word of caution, it is a busy spot so book in advance, tonight it was a full house. I have experience why. Good work by the team at Andiron Streak n Sea",

The green and white tones of the interior are very soothing...almost spa like.   The staff is friendly and knows the menu well.  The food is truly amazing.  We started with the fig and burrata salad...balanced and quite amazing.  I had a bone in filet and my wife had the wagyu skirt steak. Both were cooked to perfection. We had creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes as sides. Everything was perfect.  Dessert...oh my...we shared the lemon tart and a piece of pecan carrot cake....both were delicious in their own way so no favorites here...yet.   I look forward to many great nights that start in the vibrant bar and end with a great meal in the dining room....also brunch is coming.",

The atmosphere is beautiful, and presentation of food was great, but the service and steaks were lacking.  I ordered my steak medium, and it was brought out rare to medium rare, cold and bloody in the center.  I had to send it back and they fired it to medium, but by that time the rest of the table had finished their main courses and I just boxed mine up to go.  As for service, the table was never completely cleared for the dessert course, their were sauces and plates left from dinner.  We also had to wait an unacceptable amount of time between courses.    The live music was nice, and the bar scene was enjoyable; however, I would probably not come back for dinner again. I definitely prefer Echo and Rig for steaks and fine dining in the Summerlin area.",

And then it went downhill quickly....  When our group was seated they named off the specials. 3 of us decided we would have that. 5 minutes later, the waiter came back to advise they were out of the crab leg special at 7 pm on a Friday. We placed our orders and went on about the night. Another 5 minutes passed and they come back to tell us they were out of the ribeye special. It's a steakhouse, really. When the main entrees came out, they served the wrong cut of steak to one of our guys.   The food we did get was very good. But I felt terrible for the waiter. It wasn't his fault, but the manager never even acknowledged all the issues. The waiter was super apologetic. But he could have used managements back up. They need to learn how to order food correctly. We probably won't be back. There are so many other good places to try.",

This was the second Friday night jazz visit. I enjoy the live music and the music genre fits the ambience. Our server was excellent. On at least one occasion in which I brought my 7 year old I was treated less than excellent. Other than that once they have been very accommodating when we have children with us.  It's negroni month so of course my wife ordered one. I had a midnight rambler #2. It was strong and lasted almost the whole meal.  We started with the matzoh balls. The horseradish makes them so good. I love the burn.  We ordered the tuna off the new sashimi menu. The tuna was plentiful and fresh. I thought the accoutrements were a bit skinny. I think there are other apps that are superior. It was a toss up between that and the oysters which we had the night before at another restaurant and have had at andiron to great effect. They offer such excellent sides to the oysters.  Pea soup was hot and thick. The cream additive is the hero.",

    "text": "I wish I read the reviews PRIOR to going, however it was a very last minute decision, and boy was it a BAD one!  It was our anniversary.  First off, I had my wife call and see where would be the best parking for us in reference to the restaurant.  The hostess told her to park behind the Lazy Dog Restaurant.  If anyone knows Downtown Summerlin, that is a bit of a walk.  They could have told us about the valet AND open parking right outside of their restaurant.  That should have been a clue for us...not even knowing your parking?!  We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservation that wasn't really needed as they were empty.  Another clue...duh!  The hostess was very nice and seated us immediately with our menus.  The table was very small.  We were then greeted by, what I will call, the asst waiter, I think his name was Mike (as he helped us way more than our waitress, Jennifer.)  Mike asked us for our drink order to which we ordered bottle water.  I made a comment to my wife that we weren't given a wine menu.  Well our water came and after a few minutes, Jennifer came with, guess what, the wine and drink menu.  Well I thought that was odd, and lost my desire to order any wine now.  As we had looked over the menu, we asked Jennifer a few questions of the menu.  She answered all of our questions, however, her demeanor was that of someone that was hurried to work and was still trying to settle.  Not rude, but not pleasant either.  We started off with the Sea Platter $56 that consisted of 4 oysters, 4 shrimp cocktail, half a small lobster, crab pieces, a small cerviche, cocktail sauce, 2 slivers of lemon, and some vinaigrette.  The menu says this is for two, but after asking Jennifer about it, we also ordered the tuna cakes $16.  The presentation of both were a solid 4 star, possible a weak 5, HOWEVER, the lack of taste with any of it, coupled with the ridiculous price, scored a nice 1 star.  Prior to us finishing our appetizers, our main dishes made it to the table.  I thought this was also odd for a \"steakhouse\"...I mean, you can't check to see where we are on our apps, and fire up our main to coincide with finishing it?  Well whatever, we crowded our small table with a 12oz ribeye $29, 8oz filet $45, creamed spinach $8, mushrooms $8, loaded potato $8.  I requested my filet to be butterflied if it made it easier to get my meat well done.  Wait for it...it was not well done!  At best half medium well, and the rest medium (see pic, lots of red.)  Both of our meats were something you would find on a late night special in a casino or bar.  I must say though, I've had some much better tasting meat, and properly cooked, at casinos and bars compared to this.  Needless to say, it was so disappointing...especially for our anniversary.  Our waitress Jennifer came over ONE TIME to see how our meal was.  I showed her my filet and she suggested for me to send it back.  I was hungry, and told her no, I would just eat what I can.  I mean for $45, I should have a chef that can cook, and not have to send back food.  After that, Jennifer NEVER returned to our table, except to ask about dessert.  Mike, returned several times for our water, and to see how things were.  The manager...wait, oh that's right NO manager came to our table.  Even after my food was not cooked as requested.  Terrible manners Andiron \"steak\" and sea!  We have never balked at pricey bills for GOOD food, but this $200 bill was a TOTAL WASTE!  Here's the kicker...just as we received my paid bill back, Jennifer brought us two quarter sized cookies compliments of the pastry chef...\"Happy Anniversary,\" she said.  Really?!?  We stood up, laughed, and couldn't leave fast enough.  Read the reviews here, and save your money.  There are so many other REAL steakhouses in Las Vegas that won't disappoint like Andiron did.  Won't return, and won't recommend.",

    "text": "Ok, so this is the second time I've been here. First thing the service is wonderful, and so is the management. The kitchen needs work. My fiance took me here for my birthday dinner tonight. We ordered appetizers and the soup. When it came to ordering dinner the waitress was great. She suggested the filet, and that's what I got. I stated how much I hate an over cooked steak. Should I do med rare or rare? So we both decided to order rare to be safe. The steak came out med at best in the middle and a solid well done throughout the rest. So my fiance called her back. So nice and she felt horrible (as it's not like she's cooking) and the manager was nice to bring our the avocado toast as a \"im sorry\" . Mind you I'm kinda getting full from the food we had so far, so I only had a piece. The new steak come out and I'm so disappointed. One maybe two bites had any red at all. The waitress checked and I told her. She felt bad but I told her my guy would eat it for breakfast. If you're a steak house and cannot get a filet right I just don't think it gets a good rating. Lastly my fiance made this for birthday reservations and all we were asked was \" I'm guessing no room for dessert\" so that was kind of disappointing as well. Probably won't be back.",

Was told the lobster was a pound and a half yet when I received my plate, it was a bunch of little lobster pieces that could fit in my hand.  Not much food for $42.  Felt it was undercooked as well.  Even the sides were very small portions for the price.  It appears they charge Strip prices yet don't even come close to the quality or portion size I would get on the Strip.",

    "text": "I went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't very busy.  The place is large, so the vibe was kinda lifeless.  I was with a party of seven, and they put us in the back of the restaurant, which contributed to the dead vibe.  I think the restaurant should be a little more strategic in how they seat their guests.  I had the hamachi crudo and the grilled branzino.  The crudo was good, but not $17 good.  The branzino was served as a good portion size, which was nice, but the skin was a bit mushy.  I would stay away from that dish.  Several people at my table had a variety of steaks, and they all thought they were very good.  A funny thing is, a couple of the steak knives were dull, so they had good steaks, but had a mash the meat with the dull knife to get a bite (I'm not sure why they didn't ask for a new knife?).  The beer selection needs s lot of work.  I think they're a bit behind the times on their beer menu.  With all the great beers out there, good beer selection can really add a great experience to the meal.  All in all Andiron is a nice, well decorated place.  Maybe I hit it on an off night, but the place has a corporate, sterile feel.  Most of the food is probably pretty good, but they simply lack some attention to detail.  There are simply too many great places to try in Vegas not to be at your best all the time.",

The service was average at best and seemed like our waiter didn't want to be there. We had to flag him down several times for refills on water and wine. The appetizers were ok- corn soup was little bland and needed something? Tomato burrata really lacked seasoning and was small. Entrees were even less impressive-  Quality of beef which is the most important thing in a steakhouse was just ok at best. We had the Ribeye and filet. Carrot side was good- the waffle Mac was dry and not good! There are much better steakhouses to try in town at lower prices. Flemings for one.... To note we skipped dessert.",

Large in size and light in ambiance, the flowing space featuring an outdoor patio juxtaposing a sexy bar that greets the eye just as patrons enter the door, a first glimpse of Andiron occured during the restaurant's grand opening but waiting until buzz died down to sit for a proper meal it was with three friends that dinner was taken, the original plan of deferring to the kitchen quickly squashed when an order was requested with the resulting experience occurring over the course of two hours during which much food and fun was had.  Well appointed with white linen as large windows bathe the space with light it was after a short visit from Chef Zanelli that the meal began and first treated to a gift of melon and prosciutto it would not be long before the table was quickly overloaded, a duo of salads and four starters immediately necessitating a request for more prolonged pacing as chilled dishes were set aside to focus on those more temperature sensitive - the grilled vegetables and pork belly both highlights from round one while the flavor of the lobster was almost entirely lost amidst its accoutrements and foie gras trended a touch pricey considering its small size.  Thankfully giving time to photograph, chat, and exchange opinions of plates before queuing up course two it was again that the service structure at Andiron saw a plethora of plates arrive shortly after those from round one were cleared, and having opted to pair three entrees to four sides the results were surprisingly similar to that already experienced, both the Tomahawk Chop and Crispy Pork Schnitzel prepared as good as any off-Strip while the Linguini was texturally mushy, the carrots proving the high-point of the sides mainly as a result of the ginger puree beneath while the clever macaroni waffle was far better than the first time around in part due to the cheesy sauce added tableside.  Never one to shy away from sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that the tarte tatin and ice box cake listed online have been deep-sixed in favor of chocolate pudding cake and an admittedly impressive cherry clafoutis, it was with a quintet of complimentary desserts that the meal would end and as much as the creme brulee donuts may indeed get all the press it was actually the aforementioned almond cake alongside the Brown Butter Lemon Pie that saw everyone smiling in agreement - the later a dessert ranking high amongst Las Vegas' very best.  Thus far a hit as the restaurant was nearly 90% full on a Friday evening throughout the majority of our stay the question that few have answered is how exactly Andiron ups-the-ante compared to the likes of nearby Flemming's or even Echo & Rig, the former obviously a chain with similar price structure as well as execution while the latter is seriously flawed in its dessert program, though ringing in at 2/3 the cost for a similar upscale experience, plus in-house butchery and curing programs allowing for far more range.",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this place. We plunk down some serious change eating steak around town, so having a new one open close to us was exciting. I'll cut to the chase.   Wine - good wine selection. Unfortunately they were out of the bottle I wanted. We ended up ordering by the glass.  Lobster salad - generous portion of lobster with the salad. Tasty Sides - carrots were delicious. Asparagus was asparagus. Tots were not tots, just potato squares. Waffle Mac and cheese was sinfully good.  Desserts - key lime pie was okay. The donuts were awesome.   The main event: Filet - I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium to medium well. I hate being in an awkward position of having to send food back, especially because we were dining with another couple. Plus, they were out of the bottle of wine I wanted earlier so I already felt like we were swinging and missing.   If this weren't a steak place, I'd give them 3.5/4 stars. But you're a fancy steak place. I know, why didn't I just send my steak back for a new one? Like I said, I just hate doing that so long as it's edible. My husband traded halves with me and his medium rare steak was on point. However it wasn't anything out of this world to die for.   I'm glad we at least gave Andiron a whirl. I'd happily go back and order bites at the bar, but for local steak, we will stick with our faves of Echo and Rig and T-Bones. Sorry Andiron. :(",

    "text": "The hubby got off work early so we decided to go hit up another restaurant week participating restaurant. $50.15 for this particular 3course dinner.   We were offered nice crusty bread with soft butter and black salt while we waited.  Appetizers we went with:  ROASTED CORN SOUP (king crab, micro cilantro) which was a exceptional soup. It's hot as balls outside and I wasn't too keen on soup, but it was sweet corn flavor, great light texture and nice fresh crab pieces.   OLD BAY SHRIMP COCKTAIL (horseradish panna cotta, cocktail sauce) which had 3 huugggee shrimp pieces. Very fresh, but simple.   For the main we both went with the WAYGU SKIRT STEAK (wood fired asparagus, glazed shallots, chimichurri). On the RW site, it was a ribeye cap but when we got there it was a skirt steak. It was still good, but that is a bit more of a chewier cut of meat which the hubs didnt like as much but that's kinda the nature of this type of meat and not a error in preparation. The flavor was there. Great chimmichurri sauce, sweetest shallots I've had roasted and good char on the asparagus.   The one bone to pick with this RW menu is that it was not very balanced in the entree options. Price wise, the other 2 entrees were half the price so if you aren't ordering the steak option then you're maybe better off a la carte. I wish the fish option wasnt the salmon but one of the others.   Dessert we tried one of each offered.   ASHLEY'S CREME BRULEE DONUTS was the type of thing I could eat more of and get sick from eating beyond my capacity. Delicious creme inside a nice warm soft and crispy donut with some flambee'd sugar on the outside. More please. ALL the supply the kitchen has.   ALMOND CHERRY CLAFOUTIS (cherry creme fraiche ice cream) was not very sweet, but had a souffle' like texture. Never had a clafoutis before so I don't know what it's supposed to be like, but I dug it.   We both thought the desserts were the strongest of the RW meals we've had so far.   Service was pretty good. No major snafus and after asking once for a refilled, it never occurred again and we were checked on quite often. Kitchen staff was on it as food came out quick and proper temperatures. Not a lot of lull between courses which tends to happen.   We both did like what this place has to offer so I will be back for just a regular dinner service sometime.",

We had the mashed potatoes and the Mac and cheese waffle. I thought the potatoes were whipped too much. I like it a bit more chunky then soupy. The Mac and cheese waffle is good but made me want regular Mac and cheese. We had the creme brulee donuts which were good. Our total was over $300 including tip.

Me and my friend entered and we were greeted right away by the hostess and manager. We decided to go sit down at the bar lounge and have a quick bite to eat and some drinks. We were having a great time on this busy day and loved the experience so far. Our server was extremely nice and the busser as well. We ordered some Thai Chili wings which were amazing and we also had 2 rounds of the Stubborn as a Mule cocktails. Service was extremely friendly and it was just a beautiful place to lounge at. I recommend the service and food 100%  Everything was going great until our experience at Andiron unforgettably turned into a nightmare. We were just SO bothered and so disgusted by one of the managers who kept coming to the table and wanted to \"make sure\" we had drinks. He told us his name was michael. He brought us some champagne when he first greeted us and told us he wanted us to feel welcomed. We did feel welcomed but we also felt creeped out because of his tone of voice, unnecessary comments and body language. I felt like I was at a sleazy nightclub and someone was trying to hit on me and my friend. By this time we were almost done eating and he came back to say bye because he noticed we were leaving. We were actually trying to hurry before he came. He came up to us and reached over for a half hug and gave us a weird look. This man was extremely creepy and I WILL NEVER come back as long as he is there. This is so unfortunate because EVERYTHING else was amazing but to have a \"disciplined\"  man in a suit who you call a manager act like that with guest is unforgettable and disgusting. Horrible! I left very disappointed.",
