    "text": "Coming from out of town Chicago, and both me and my girlfriend being servers, our service was very poor. Waitress was rude and messed up my girlfriends order by not bringing dressing on the side or adding the shrimp. Sante fe chicken wrap was very bland. Couple next to us couldn't track waitress down to get bill and had to get up and locate her near the bar. In conclusion, service was really really poor and food was very bland and lacking. We also had a fishbowl and it was so sugary I couldn't drink it. I understand that negative restaurant experiences happen from time to time, but our experience here was honestly really bad, and with the other numerous places around I can say in hindsight that we wouldn't have of come here. As Im writing this review we have been waiting for 20 minutes just to get our bill paid. Go somewhere else.",

Walked to the bathroom and there was tape all over the men's bathroom ( out of order). I asked our waitress off there was a way I could use the bathroom as I have a medically diagnosed weak bladder. They refused me. I asked to speak to the Manager Kelly Marshall who was even more aloof and rude. She was defensive and treated us like we were free loaders. Even when I tried to explain to her that I absolutely needed to use the bathroom because of my medical condition she basically said: : \" well I can't help you\" .. I'm The Manager Kelly Marshall and you absolutely can't use the bathroom. Very distasteful. I'm totally appalled and can't believe the customer service experience I had. Needless to say I won't be returning and BEWARE!!! KELLY MARSHALL you should be ashamed!",

    "text": "Mickie Finnz is my downtown \"Home Base\".  Since the downtown scene is so exciting, it is good to have a place where everyone knows you.  Well, not everyone.  I mainly go here late night on the weekends.  The main draw, for me, is the live music and it is exceptional with high marks to my fav, All the MadMen.  The area in front of the stage serves as a dance floor and the servers will clear out tables if you want to dance.  The theme is a Pacific, beachy-surfer hang out.  I assume Pacific for the tikis and palm thatched overhangs.  There are both indoor & outdoor dining.  Also, uniquely, it is kid friendly.  There is no smoking in the establishment, but they do provide smoking areas just outside the main door.  The outdoor dining is divided into a couple areas, some regular tables with full view of the stage that is separated from the main dining area by folding, glass doors which are typically, fully open.  The other area has a fire pit, more table seating and the \"patio\" bar.  If there is a band playing and you want to have a conversation, this area is your best bet.  Food-wise, I typically only get appetizers and really enjoy the bucket of fries.  They have daily drink specials and you can use certain apps to get half-off a signature cocktail, each visit.  Additionally, there is a \"claw\" machine, that, for $2, if you can catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for your $2 Lobster Dinner.  You gotta read the fine print, I suppose.  Cocktails, well, I am not well versed in the sweet drink category, but I do order MaiTais, Margaritas, and have been known to share either of their \"fishbowl\" drinks, the Big Wave (contains Red Bull) or the Biggest Blue Hawaiian.  These are an exceptional value at $20 for a 64oz drink and pretty tasty, too.  Here is a direct link to their menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mickiefinnzlasvegas.com%2Fmenu.html&s=ba7f83f3c02e10e2c2011a89306fbabfef52e7e5e947fbf817bf224185a0b4c4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mickiefinnzlasvegas.com/...</a>  The service i experience is almost always very good.  Partly because I am a regular, I am sure.  My bottom line, the staff is friendly, the drinks are good (and can be cheap), and the live music is amazing.  I recommend it as super casual, night-time hang out, especially on the weekends.",

The (2) stars is for the food. The street tacos were good, but way too soggy so it fell apart as soon as I picked it up.   The server only came by once to take our order. We sat, ate and finished our food for 30 minutes and never did the server come by to check on us. As you can imagine I had to walk back to the host and have her close me out.   There were at least 6 serves working too. Smh.   Again T E R R I B L E service!!!!",

    "text": "Whenever I work downtown, it's always nice to have lunch at a place that offers adult beverages.  Remember, it's always 5pm somewhere! LOL.  For this lunch, we decided to visit Mickie Finnz as it was national Margarita day.  Don't ask me how we knew that.  Our group is bunch of drinkers and we always know alcoholic Holidays.    The one thing I noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated.  Contrasting colors like bright blue, yellow and red, wooden chairs and an overall tropical theme.  I do enjoy the amount of natural lighting that comes into the restaurant.  The bar is airy and there's ample seating.    For lunch, I started with a Suntan Martini for $8.00.  I know it was national Margarita day, however, I'm a bigger martini fan.  Remember that if you check into Foursquare, you get 50% off of any signature cocktail.  This martini has coconut and pineapple rums mixed with tropical fruit juices, then shaken.  Super sweet cocktail so be advised.  For lunch I got the Giant Fish Sandwich for $10.95.  This sandwich had a huge cut of beer battered cod, with lettuce, red onions and tomatoes all on a toasted French roll.  This dish is served with tartar sauce, tortilla chips and salsa.  This sandwich was on point!  The cod was perfect cooked, super crispy on the outside and flaky and juicy on the inside.  The tartar sauce perfectly complimented the fish and sandwich as a whole.    Overall, my experience was actually a good one.  Haven't heard the best of reviews from some, but I thought my experience was great.  The drinks were good, the food was great, I'm definitely coming back :)",

We danced to the band, great little dance floor ... could have listened to the band all night, the lead singer needs to be signed with a record label.

Have never eaten here, but they do make great Mai-Tai's; and if you play the slots while you drink, your drinks are free!  They also have Happy Hour.  I've read mixed reviews about the food, but since I've never eaten here I can't comment on that.  I recommend Mickie Finnz for the fun atmosphere and great drinks!",

Greens, some diced tomatoes, and dressing. $6  The Blackened Ahi Tuna is a paltry 4oz. joke.   The ahi was poorly cooked and too firm.   The cajun seasoning was overly applied causing a very salty bad taste.  It comes with stickyrice (not eaten) and bolied veggies (OK)  $15.  The best thing on the menu id the beer and even that is limited to 5 choices (one being PBR).   Oh, the second star is for the good service by the bartender.  Otherwise, this may be a1 star place.  Go somewhere else with your money.",

They gave me a small scoop of rice, two pieces of shrimp that wasn't even cooked well and a side of sliced cucumbers. Such a rip off. Didn't enjoy my meal at all.  The waitress was nice but she didn't refill our drinks. We were still left thirsty.  The food seemed to take a long time to get out.  The only plus about the restaurant was the entertainment. There was a guy playing a guitar and singing live on stage. Great cover songs he sang.  My husband's food was more appetizing than mine. My daughter's pizza looked better than mine. See my photos.  I think this place is a good hang out place and a place to drink beer and mixed drinks.  I wouldn't come back for the food.",

It had a good amount of cheese and chicken with guacamole and sour cream on the side at no extra cost!  At first the service was really good. Our waitress gave us water, greeted us and asked if we had any questions, etc. After we got our food though, she was no where in sight for the remainder of our time there. We needed to get the bill so I had to ask another waitress for it since I couldn't find the one we had originally. We paid by credit card and left them on the table for a bit while we finished our drinks and thinking our waitress would come by to pick them up. We finished our drinks and they still were not taken for payment, so I had to ask another waitress for our credit cards to be taken and process the payment. Once she figured out the totals and what not, she came by and even said, so sorry but I have no idea where your waitress went. Coincidentally, neither did we!   Again, if you're looking for a place to eat that is cheap and in the middle of the downtown strip, go here. But don't expect the best customer service.",

The fry took 15 minutes to get to us and came out cold like they were hanging out under the heat lamp. When we ask to speak to a manager the bar back told us that that wasn't his job to which my wife replied well then go get me a manager. He called my wife a b**** as he walked away my wife pursued him and began to tell him what a piece of s*** he is for talking to a guest like that. As we were leaving and paid our tab mind you the server berated us on the patio in front of guests. All my wife and I wanted was to go out and enjoy dinner instead we were insulted , braided, and still no manager came to address the situation. My wife and I have been out here for 30 years and we have never had such awful service in all of our time I hope this restaurant shuts down.",

We had absolutely fabulous nachos, and we ordered these because my Mum had been in Vegas in 2015, and had been here and eaten the nachos. They nachos were loaded with black beans, cheese, guac, salsa etc. and they were fresh, flavourful, and plentiful. Enough for dinner for two (for Australian stomachs at least). I actually ended up going back again, as I went to Fremont St a second time on my trip, with a small group of people who weren't up for trying out one of the cool looking places further down towards the Old Vegas neon signs. If I was back at Fremont St I would definitely eat somewhere down there as my fellow Yelpers had lots of good things to say about a few of them.   My second time there, I was aware that the food I'd spotted other people eating (and that other Yelpers had eaten) didn't seem great. I wasn't super hungry and I was open to eating a little somethin somethin more when we got back to the strip, so I just ordered the garden salad with ranch and asked them to add bacon and avocado. This was actually a damn good salad! Everyone else's enchiladas, tacos, etc. look so-so. Although one of my dining partners said her steak was one of the best she'd ever had, so huh, who knows hey!  Mickie Finnz, has a great location, you can watch some of the action as people arrive at Fremont St, and as they hop on the giant scales outside of the Heart Attack Grill. Cheap, strong cocktails, but I'd still rather get a margarita from one of the drink stands further down and wander through the craziness.",

Very misleading. Hardly big, and tasteless to boot. He said he was thankful for tartar sauce.  Buffalo Wings- no buffalo sauce actually on them, but they had a slight spice to them. They were ok. Nothing special - wouldn't order them again. Served with fries.  Kids all ordered pizza - they ate them without complaint.  Chicken tacos - my sister said they were good. I think she got the best item.  My BIL ordered the fish &chips - again nothing special. I think they fry everything in the same oil. We had 2 root beers, and 3 reg beers - our bill was over $100.

Now, with the addition of Flightlines zip lining, and some trendy Martini and dive bars on the fringe streets,, it's starting to gain traction.  I wouldn't eat at Mickey Finns. All the food we've ever been served was pre-frozen, tasteless Sysco - Shamrock Institution fare,, but the outside bar is a fun place.   We always get outstanding service, and the drinks are great too. A clean, well run operation with mediocre tourist trap food.  The house drink here is the Wet Pussy: 1 oz pineapple juice 1/2 oz Midori melon liqueur 1/2 oz peach schnapps 1/2 oz 7-Up soda",

Good burgers, nice, funny staff, their lounge area is excellent to just sit back, and people watch (not to mention that great fire pit of theirs), live music....  All of that is well and good, but that's not my favorite part.  \"What is it then\", you ask?  Drinks served in coconuts carved to look like monkeys.  For $12 mere dollars, you can get an amazing coconut carved to look like a monkey.  Not to mention that there are various types of banana liqueur drinks served for said amazing beverage holder.  The first time I went there, they were sold out, and that made me sad.  Last night?  I was getting that monkey, by gum.  So in I went, ordered it, and walked out to a surprised patio full of friends and unrelated patrons.  \"I drink out of coconuts now\", I said after a mighty sip of banana booze.  \"Coconuts are cool\".  And you even get to take the coconut home, which means that I get to be cool any time I feel like it.  They'll have to pry this drink amazement out of my cold, dead hands before they can take it away from me.  And this is why I love the various bars of Fremont Street.",

The servers are really nice and friendly.  The type of people who come here are people who are looking for a good time and just feel relaxed.  When I come here I'm warmed with friendly smiles by all the employees.  The first greeting I get is \"Have a seat anywhere you like\".  When you walk up the few stairs to the right is a fire pit to warm you on a cold night while sipping on a Corona, Budweiser, Jack, Sex On the Beach, Washington Apple, a shot of Jose.    Or, you can sit inside by the bar and talk to a bartender as he/she pours you a drink.  Another alternative is to sit on a table by the band playing as you order food.  Either way, what ever it is you decide to do here you'll have a great time.  I only ended up eating fries  and drinking red bull, and a coke but I'm looking forward to eating more of their food when I have more free time.  I've only had the ambiance and the interaction with the employees.  I am looking to eat Steak on Monday and drink a beer when time comes.",

    "text": "On my crew's past weekend's reintroduction to downtown, one of the places we were required to hit was Mickie Finnz for their fabled fish bowl cocktails.  Unlike the giant 'fishbowl' drinks at other Vegas establishments, I had photographic evidence that this cocktail came in an actual fishbowl with ginormously long neon straws.  This brought me more excitement than should be allowed.  Mickie Finnz is apparently a 'fish house' that is next door to Hennessey's tavern directly on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Fremont, across from Neonopolis.  There wasn't much evidence of fish housery when we went, but the bar was open and a cover band was playing their heart out.  We ordered the fishbowl drink - The Big Surf - at a price of $15.95 a piece.  It touted 64 oz of boozey deliciousness, although we surmised that half of that was ice and another 1/4 pure pineapple juice, but regardless it was tasty and IN A FISHBOWL.  The band played cover band standards by Jewel and Alanis Morissette and my friend Lunchbox (he'd had a few) was popping and locking in front of them all by his lonesome, to the band's utter delight.  Of course, being a restaurant the ambiance was slightly lacking, and the clientele was all tourists save us.  It wasn't the most thrilling place in the entire world, but I recommend it highly if you're as excited as I was at the prospect of drinking out of a fishbowl.  In which case, I have the number of a counselor you may also want to see.",

I don't mind having to go to a place with lower-than-average quality of food, but if I do, I don't want to be charged like I'm at a restaurant that produces quality food.  I got the steak taco meal here, and I know I can get more food (ie. 3 tacos instead of two, one cup of beans and rice instead of a drop of beans and no rice) that is of much better quality at a hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant FOR A CHEAPER PRICE than here.

He wanted to take us to the Heart Attack Grill right across the way but a place that advertises excessive calorie burgers freaked us out a little.   This place is kitschy and a little seedy, but a nice cozy contrast to the extravagance of The Strip. We had some fish tacos and crab cakes which were all solid, but not incredible. We appreciated the accurate pricing of the food.   The young lady who was our server was as unenthusiastic as they come, but we weren't expecting much more.   Definitely a no-frills dive. Reminiscent of Islands restaurants.",

Two of my friends weren't feeling well and wanted to get their food to go asap, and all we were told was that there was a big table ahead of us. Needless to say, it was that table and maybe two others in the entire restaurant besides ours. It was just about 35 minutes before we got our appetizer, and then almost an hour when we received our entrees. The pineapple rice was hard and unflavorful. The waitress was nice, but it was hard trying to find her for drinks and refills. It was my first time on Freemont Street, and I probably wouldn't go back there when I'm in Vegas next. There are a few other restaurants I would go to first before this place.",

It was early afternoon on a Saturday. Looking over the menu, it was pretty standard.  Typical bar food.  We decided to split some apps.  The nachos, the wings, the street tacos.  The nachos were good.  Standard nachos.  I like when they use the tri color tortilla chips.  The buffalo wings came with fries.  Both were average.  The street tacos weren't good.  Just a little dry.  Meh.  Wouldn't order them again.  It was a decent stop.",

It wasn't hard to notice because of the wide open patio area they have in front of the place. Very roomy.  The feel was kinda surfer-bar-ish. We ordered up a few drinks and hung out for a bit. Then we decided nibble on some simple nacho which were decent. A little easy on the black beans next time maybe.  The server was super cool and fun. She was on top of it.  We'll probably return to Mickie Finnz next time we're on our next stroll in the Fremont area. Lots of fun.",

I was charged $12 for a glass of grapefruit juice (not even an ingredient!) with no nutmeg (they didn't even have any), and when I said it was weak I got charged $12 for a floater (which I swear was watered down to start, and light not dark rum!). So, I threw a $27 (w tip) drink in the trash. Thanks Mr. Bartender, your total lack of empathy really made my night. (Maybe I wasn't clear on just how much I loved this place before. Sure, they have tourist pricing, whatever I don't expect to be treated like a local on Fremont; but I did look forward to my drinks whenever we were going down there, and it was kinda always my motivation to go to Fremont in the first place! And I would walk from ANYWHERE, pass all other bars, to get my drinks here, all night long. I wish they had just closed down so I didn't feel like we'd broken up LOL I'm heartbroken!)",

Since it was late we decided to split the Alaskan Ale fish and chips served with coleslaw. Fish appeared to be a step above a fish stick. Fries were soggy even though we requested them well done. Coleslaw not to our taste. Disappointment overall.  Service was indifferent.   Sure missed the corn dog and fried Twinkies that we usually get on Fremont Street. Our go to was under construction.",

My daughter ordered a root beer float, they brought her a glass of vanilla ice cream.......with no root beer, it took our cell phone talking waitress 10 minutes to get it, this was after repeated requests.  I could go on with every members of our group having issues but you get where I'm going.  If you want to try this place then go ahead, but first walk into one of their restrooms.  My wife and friend did after our meal and told me they had never seen a more disgusting toilet room ever, they walk out of this place before I could pay the bill.

I show up at the appointed hour and wait for some service at my table. The area is not overcrowded with the other 7 people in the place. After no service shows, I go up to the bar ... ready to drink.  I am informed that they now longer have the shot glass for the special, but would I be interested in another of their fine margaritas. \" We sold more than 1200 of the specials.\" Looking around at the emptiness I thought perhaps the special actually brought some real business here.  Do they not think it might be a good idea to order some additional glasses to enhance the number of customers ????  I asked why is the sign still up - if you can't get the special .... I'm not sure I got an answer, but I did find out once again that they sold more than 1200 of the specials. I informed the bartender that that did not do much for me.  All in all - poor service and a classic bait and switch -   \"we don't have that ....  but can I interest you in .....\"   I think they specialize in \"Sad hours\" ... not \"Happy Hours.\" Enter at your own risk.",

    "text": "Went there for a quick bite since I didn't want to go to eat at the casinos which are smelly. We grabbed a table outside, looked like nobody even cared that we arrived and they weren't busy at all. One waitress said she'll come soon but never did. So we went to the bar which was almost empty and tried to order food there. Unfortunately, we had to go back to previous table because my brother's I'D was expired (he just forgot that it expired couple days ago but he didn't have any problems at the airport) and couldn't sit there. Another waitress came immediately and we order food. Apps and main course later. Our apps which were buffalo wings and sliders were just ok. The weird thing is our main course arrived just minutes after we received our apps. We got carne asada taco plate and chicken taco plate. Chicken was so dry, not tasty at all. Carne was just alright. I was extremely disappointed by the fact that is it right in the center of old part of Vegas and wanted to have a nice experience there. At least we didn't pay too much. I think that's the only plus. I wonder how they want to stay in business with such slow service and awful food. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

My bf is not a fan of the them.. he's a 49er fan..and I love him IN SPITE of that.  Anyways.. this place was where he chose.. out of every place on the FSE area. really? there was a live singer which w/h been cool if we werent there to watch a game. I was not feeling well and ordered only water and the waitress kept trying to get me to order a drink? not sure if I HAD to order one b/c we were seated @ the bar, but w/e. My bf ordered me a drink that was very good but I'd never come here again b/c the prices were just ridiculous. If you are planning on ordering just one, well go right ahead but to me, that lil small drink wasnt worth $9.00. I know iv'e ordered mixed drinks on the strip, hell @ caesar's palace bars for about the same but they were big drinks. This place was just over-priced and we could have gone elsewhere. You are paying for environment in my opinion, and a pushy waitress.",

Actually, the fish taco was good, but the shrimp and mahi mahi were mediocre at best. The soda tasted funky, to the point where my bf sent his back. It looks like a fun place to drink at night and they have live music and a tropical cabana theme. They also had a claw machine with live lobsters, (you catch it, they cook it.) It'd probably be a fun place to go drink with friends. But as far as dinner goes, if you're in Vegas, do yourself a favor and eat at one of the other million restaurants.",

    "text": "My friend and I came across Mickie Finnz Fish House after searching down Fremont St. for an Italian eatery we saw advertised the night before.  Since we were tired from a lot of walking, and hungry to say the least, we decided to hit it up.  Needless to say, our experience was flat-out BAD.  The hostess lets us decide where to sit, and that a waitress would be on her way (with 1/3 capacity full, it still took her a little over 10 minutes to reach our table, a table seated on the outside with only 2 other cpls/groups being waited on.)  If that's your policy as a business, you damn-sure better be on your shit for service, and this was not the case.  Usually the 3-strike rule should apply, but for some reason we ended up giving her more than deserved.  She finally gets to us and asks for drinks.  STRIKE 1-  I wanted a house margarita, and rather than ask for on the rocks or blended, she jotts it down and proceeds back to the bar.  Fucker.  She comes back about another 10 minutes later with our drinks (noted: our table was about 15 feet away from the outside walk-up bar) but luckily my drink was how I wanted it in the first place.  Still, all this took way too long to happen, which shoulda been a sign to just drink there and eat somewhere else...  bad choice.  So we order our food (split between a \"Shrimp Bucket [sided with fries] and Mahi-Mahi [sided w/ vegs]) and after a cpl minutes decide to walk around a little to look at a map of the area.  As we're approaching back to our table, our waitress, helping another family near the entrance, reinterates our order one more time making sure she didn't get it wrong.  Not that there's anything wrong with getting it right, but isn't that why we write orders down?  STRIKE 2-  Our food comes out, but we've yet to be given silverware nor plates of any kind.  First, the \"shrimp bucket\" was clearly misleading as it had approx. 8 grilled (er, should we say BURNED) shrimp on skewers, and a bucket about  10\" high filled with fries... yes, more like \"FRIES Bucket [sided w/ Burnt Shrimp]\"  That's what it shoulda said, else we would've never ordered it!  As for the Mahi-Mahi?  STRIKE 3-  It might have been pan-coconut-crusted but it was pretty much between the raw-rare stages... something, as a waitress, she should've confirmed before, asking how we wanted the fish to be cooked.  It was tasteless and only fared decent with the drizzle of hot sauce provided next to the cold side of veggies.  Oh yes, apparantly the dish already comes with vegetables, and had I known that I could've ordered something different. That constitutes an automatic STRIKE 4!  Oh before I forget, when we have to ASK for plate/silverware, she brings out 1 (yes, one, singular) plate and some fork/knife set that looked just washed.  Not just bringing it to us, she half-heartedly drops the plate in front of my friend.  STRIKE 5!   Then to top it off, she comes back one time only to check up on us, and while I ignore her my friend has the urge to stick it to her about the food, to which she takes as an invite to bring over the manager... we didn't want the manager, nor did we ask for him.  But still, she does it anyway-  #6!  So we end up explaining everything to him, and all he can do is order my friend another Mojito, one that he refused the first time but the manager still persisted to bring out.  As you can imagine, there was NO tipping involved here.  It simply would've felt WRONG to do so.  And I would NEVER E-V-E-R recommend this place to any tourist, let alone neighborhood regular.  If the food was outstanding I might be able to put up with the subpar JV-type service, but even the food sucked.  The only approval I can give is the the fries... those were decent, and pretty big too, but not worth all the other shit thrown in.  A waste of both $$$ and time, Mickie Finnz gets TWO BIG FUCKING THUMBS DOWN!",

We were super hungry, and also needed some drinks, and the place was relatively quiet early Saturday evening. So we got seated quickly, and had a wonderful server named Melinda, who absolutely made our stay there fabulous! She was attentive, helpful (one of our party has celiac and needed accommodation, which was cheerfully given) and very cute!   I was thrilled to see a tiki-inspired drink menu, and I ordered a Horny Monkey, which comes in a coconut carved into monkey form! Nothing makes me happier than a yummy, fruity, STRONG drink served in something awesome that I can take home!! This met my criteria beautifully.  Food-wise, I had grilled shrimp and veggies, which was good, and chips and salsa. I don't remember, for some reason, what my friends had, but they were happy with their food and drink!  A live band began to play soon after we got our food, not too loud for our old ears but just right. Rock classics, mostly, and it got several of us dancing!  We later ordered a fishbowl of something yummy, serving the four of us well.  Our server was fab! She asked another server for recommendations for dance clubs for the, uh, more cougar crowd, and we got pointed in the right direction. Yay!   We'll be back on our next trip!",

Nachos dry as this place is. I should have asked for my \"45 minute\" lobster to go, it was cold regardless. Don't walk, run a way from this place. Oh and if you tell your server the food here was bad, her response will be she didn't cook the food, not I am sorry to hear that maybe you should speak with my manager. Hey maybe if you don't know how to cook seafood, remove it from your menu.",

The drinks had no good flavor, the bartender obviously doesn't know how to mix what with what, because she used the wrong liquor to make our drinks, I sent those drinks back cause I'm not paying for something I won't be enjoying, the place is not even nice and all the staff looks ghetto.",

Live \"good\" music every night, nice bar and seating areas with a tropical atmosphere. This place gets busy but we were always able to find a spot at one of the bars. They get a huge influx of people coming off  Fremont street for drinks to go. The bartenders handled the business always with a nice smile and friendly attitude, very cute and cool.   The fish tacos were great and fair priced considering the location. Good beers on tap too.  I have never been a big fan of Vegas, but this trip to The Freemont Street Experience and Mickie Finnz changed my mind. Will be going back soon.",

    "text": "We walked up to this place on a Saturday night and took a table outside by the fire pit.  The atmosphere of this place is lively.  It's one of those places that are going to be busy anyway, so the staff doesn't have to make an effort and it shows. Although a table of 3 left next to us, nobody came to bus it and it remained full of dirty dishes!  Customers kept coming up wondering if the table was open and then walking away!  We should've left upon that observation but we really wanted to get some food in us and it was warm sitting by the fire.  I ordered a strawberry daquiry, it was super sweet and watered down so I ordered a long island iced tea next which was also watered down.  My boyfriend ordered draft beer (impossible to screw up) and I ordered the fish and chips for us to share.  All the while, our server Kimberly did not stand at the table for 5 seconds.  So I wasn't surprised when the food came, that while the fish was piping hot, the fries probably sat out for a while and were not hot.  There were only 3 small greasy pieces of fish.  While I expect grease with anything fried, not enough where they have to be squeezed with a towel.  When the bill came, it was for $74.00 so my boyfriend told me to ask for the itemized bill which she did not bring the first time.  Kimberly said to me pretty condescendingly, \"Honey, that's the part you would sign.\"  I said I understand that but he wants the itemized version, she was pretty annoyed we were asking for it.  Well lo and behold, the first bill she brought us was for some other table, our actual bill was only $52.00.  My boyfriend was livid, and a simple apology would've made up for it, but all we got from her is, \"I'm human, I make mistakes.\"  No doubt she figured we were drinking so we wouldn't notice.  If my boyfriend did not have so much to drink, I have no doubt he would've asked to speak to the manager but instead we will just put this place on our \"never return to or recommend\" list.",

When it was time for the claw to move side ways and drop off the lobster, the claw could not support the weight of the lobster and dropped back in the water and released the lobster. When called the staff they said that's how it is. When I told them that it's cheating they replied yes and that was it.  So based on their conduct I would not eat here either",

With the food, it was average to below average at best.  Wife and I had the Baja fish tacos and definitely on the lower end of fish tacos I've had.  Batter used was just a little off.  Wasn't terrible but could see others deciding to not finish the meal.    Guacamole was serviceable but nothing exciting.  So you're reading this thinking well, this should place should probably be getting two or three vs. one star.  Here is where the place faltered hard:  service.  Waitress was regularly nowhere to be found.  When happened to get a chance to interact person was with asked for a refill.  Person said she'd be on it.  Never came back.  Food dropped off but still no refill and now all of our cups were empty.  Asked waitress who dropped food if we could get more drinks and could tell was a little annoyed. Couldn't tell if bothered we asked her or was used to having to assist our waitress.  Waitress comes by to get an inventory of drinks.  Comes back with just my water and said would be getting the rest.  Eventually came back with sodas.    Asked for check and that took awhile.  Then waiting for the return to get the checks paid.  Could hear at adjacent tables grumbling about the service so seemed to be a restaurant wide issue.  If coming to Fremont St., walk past Mickie Finnz and pop open that Yelp app to find something respectable.",

We hadn't, and had been waiting a while. She said she'd find our server, but would absolutely take our order to get it going. We were clueless on what to order as the menu looked so good. She suggested their signature cocktails and we got the Gorilla Creamsicle and the Painkiller. She also let us know that her biggest sellers were the nachos, burgers, and tacos. So we started with the Finns Nachos which were amazing. I got the Shirimp Spicy Tacos and my man got the Pretzel burger. I have had a lot of food in Vegas and this was delicious. Tiffany ended up keeping us even though she visibly had tables completely on the other side of the restaurant and was completely slammed! She was a doll and even took the time to tell us where to go afterwards for our date night. I would absolutely recommend Tiffany, her team, and establishment, as I am a server myself. Thanks for a great time!",

It has a very cool atmosphere and offers outside bar/patio dining as well as inside bar and restaurant dining.  The decor is really good actually, considering its downtown.  (ew not a fan of most things downtown)     Our server was Kate and she was fantastic.  She was very personable and her recommendations from the menu were spot on.  Service was very prompt and everything came out correct and delicious.    Also, we went during happy hour so we got discounts on booze, (never a bad thing) and discounts on appetizers as well.    I had the Baja fish tacos and they were splendid.  Beer Battered Cod, with cabbage and a reealllllyyyy good tartar sauce.   yum.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and she enjoyed it.    For dessert: wait for it........   BANANA CHIMICHANGA - are you kidding me?   exactly what you are thinking...   banana, flour tortilla, deep fried with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce... omg, one of my favorite desserts I have had in a very long time.   I would go back specifically because of this.    Oh yeah, bonus... the manager, Sarah (i believe) even came over to put her personal stamp on things to make sure things were going well.   overall a GREAT experience.  I would definitely go back... next time I am downtown, I will definitely hit this place up.... as should you!",

After feeling like someone took a cream pie to my soul, I decide to go order the most conspicuously bombastic drink ever.   A cocktail in a fish bowl.  We decide to order the most fizzy, neon, gut-bleaching drink on the menu. The stuff is mostly comprised of rum and some nondescript energy drink. The server pleads with me to not order the stuff.   \"Um. Don't do this to yourself,\" she says with biblical conviction.   \"I have to! I have no choice!\" I exclaim, the collar of my shirt drunkenly crooked and sticking up like ruffled feathers on a limping pigeon.   \"Whatever, man,\" I hear from the now indifferent lips of the once concerned server.  The concoction of well spirits, the juicy innards of a popped open can of energy drink, and the distilled hatred of a thousand future memories is swelling in the witch's cauldron of this gigantic fish bowl. My eyes light up; not from excitement but because the color of this drink is so bright. It looks like the green ooze from those Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.  My girlfriend and I spend the next thirty minutes passing this monstrous thing back and fourth like it was a medicine ball. After we finish the fish bowl we spend the next three days feeling like someone took an ice pick to our frontal lobes. That said, I would definitely recommend playing Russian roulette at Mickie Finnz - but only if someone is with you who will share the agony and regret with good humor.",

The server was nice but, seemed to disappear in the kitchen. Maybe she was trying to help.   All of this was not a big deal but, what made this a bad experience, was when the band started. It was so loud, we had to scream at each other across the table and at the server. It's downtown and most places have loud music but, these guys were pretty bad. They were off key and out of sync. The place was pretty empty so, we asked the server, to get the music turned down. It didn't happen. We even moved to the back of the restaurant. I couldn't get out of there quick enough. I quickly, asked for the check and explained once again that the music was just, unpleasant.   I've walked by several times since then, while dining at other downtown restaurants. I just can't bring myself to try it again.",

The live band performing also set the mood for a truly enjoyable dinner. Although we failed at the lobster zone crane game it made for a fun addition to this unique restaurant on Fremont.

We also use the certificates from the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restaurant.com&s=8cac03c1efb29efee41b3411fe3b107de69265557b5804295adb319e7abd90ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> program. (They got wise though; they adjusted the certificate value from $35 to $50.) This is one of the best restaurants in the downtown/Fremont Street Experience area. The atmosphere is a fun beach theme. There are a ton of tv's, indoor seating with booths and tables, outdoor seating with a fire pit, and a bar in the front of the restaurant. We've eaten at the adjoining Hennessy's (same kitchen, different menu & theme- Irish Pub) but I just thought it was alright. If you park in the Neonopolis garage (red), you can get your parking ticket validated here.    We really like the Nachos & BBQ Chicken Pizza (it's as good as CPK's but cheaper, $9.99). The pulled chicken on both of these dishes is yummy. If you come with a crowd, you can order a couple pizzas, the nachos, and another appetizer for pretty cheap. If it's just me and my husband, we usually bring home leftovers. We've taken many people here and they all like the food as well. I love the nachos- it's my favorite in this city. We had the buckets before, but were really disappointed- the meat was plain, the portions were small, and it wasn't like \"Rockin Baja Lobster.\" We wished that we had ordered our favorites.  There are daily specials (two for one deals). One part of the restaurant looks like it's set up for late night entertaining. It's a neat place with cheap food, but when we come for lunch or dinner, it's pretty empty- hope that it stays open. We've had good servers and some not-so-attentive servers. But we overlook it when it does happen, because we like the food so much. Side note: We tried meeting our out of town friends here for dinner but the power went out; that was disappointing, but not the restaurant's fault- it was raining that night. Honorable mention: one time, our food took a while to come out, the pizza was taken off our bill, courtesy of the manager. As I said before, Hennessy's (neighbor and same kitchen) did not impress me.",

Anything to try and salvage the awfulness of this. Hardly any cheese. We were a party of four. No one touched this bowl of nachos which were touted as \"shareable.\" I wouldn't dare return the nachos... We know what pissed-off chef's do! Nachos in a cinema are better. I ate here May 1st. Nice server.... We decided to eat here because there was live acoustic music inside. However, this was quickly ruined by the annoying drummers who set up their pan-handling space right outside on Fremont in front of the restaurant. Other than ordering a beer I would not recommend the food in this place. My friend's chicken wings were hi-hum. I can get better wings in the frozen section at SAMs or Costco.",

    "text": "Samples off the appetizer menu before the show we caught. 1 pound of fries in a bucket means a handful served in a bucket when they should just come on a small plate. Most of the bucket is filled with paper. It actually made me mad. Chips and guac. Tiny. Another miss. Chicken wings. Good sized with a lot of meat. Medium means mild. Go hot. Nachos were awesome. Lots of toppings. The best topping was the shredded chicken. I'd definitely order that and the wings again. The only reason they get 3 is the giant 60 ounce pint glass filled with PBR for 25 bucks. It works out to 5 bucks a pint but you get to keep the huge glass. I think I'll use it during baseball season.",

    "text": "Attracted by the live band.  Left because of horrible food and poor service. Poor selection of draft beer.  Wandered in around 9:45pm on a Wednesday when I heard the great music.  Small three piece band playing some good cover tunes.  Waited 15 mins before a server asked if I wanted anything.  Just as soon as I ordered some wings the band took a break (around 10pm).  About that time most of the other patrons left the club.  The wings show up about 20 mins later.  Now there is just me and one other person in the club.  The band is sitting in a booth eating.  The wings are very fatty and just warm--like they had been sitting around.  Nearly an hour goes by and the band is still eating.  Even though this is Vegas I seriously doubt that much of a crowd will show up after 11pm on a Wednesday night.  I don't know if the band ever started back up because I finally got the check (after asking for it 20 mins earlier) and left just after 11.",

Sat at the bar which is right by the open windows, had a nice breeze, gambled, drank, watched football [notice the underlying tone of 90% of my reviews], enjoyed the nice day.  I ordered a fish sandwich with no bun. It came with tri-colored nacho looking chips that I ignored, did try the salsa and it definitely was 'overworked' it was more like a sauce then a salsa.  But the fish was pretty good...pretty sure it was previously frozen but you aren't going to get 'fresh' Mahi Mahi in the desert. I put some lemon on it as it was a little plain [maybe order it blackened].  Friend got the fried fish tacos which he said he liked. I will have to agree with Mark Z here, he also got black beans and rice and boy were they bland!  Definitely not cooking it up Cuban or Mexican style, it's white boy bland. A little Goya Sazon would do these up much better, maybe some peppers and onions [talk to the Havana Grille they got some black beans going on!]  We gambled= 2 drinks, 4 shots, and 2 meals our total bill was $21.00 with tax [not tip]. We tipped pretty well since we didn't get charged for drinks and good service at the bar.  I'd go again.  I wouldn't drive to go there, but if I was in the area it would be an option.",

    "text": "I need to return to Mickie Finnz someday to try something different than what I had last night after the Yelp event at Commonwealth. I was buzzing off alcohol so my review isn't completely based off of a sober palate.   The many times I have been Downtown I have always passed by Mickie Finnz assuming it was just another bar. I had no idea they actually had food. It is usually overshadowed by Hennessy's - the tavern next door that I used to frequent quite often while trying to max out my Jameson stamp card.  But back to Finnz - basically my friends and I needed food after drinking so much, so actually, this place was perfect. They offer a very eclectic menu, with some sandwiches, \"munchies\" (apps), and \"Buckets\" of seafood. I didn't really care to have a bucket last night so I went for a \"munchie\" instead.  I ordered the Chimichanga appetizers. I did not know what to expect because I was ordering Mexican food at an Irish sounding seafood place. (?) They came out naked aka they were not smothered with red sauce and cheese like you will typically get chimichangas. However, they were deep fried to a nice crispy exterior and hot interior of ground beef. I was surprised by the ground beef - usually chimichangas are shredded, but it did not deter me from eating them. They also come with a salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and lettuce. You can basically fork on whatever you like onto each chimichanga as you eat it. The platter comes with four of the mini chimichangas.  Our service was pretty good, our waitress nice. Although it would have been nice to have had our waters filled a little more often.   Like I said, I need to go back and give it another try. Next time I'll probably go for some seafood and get one of those \"buckets\" of fried deliciousness. For now I am giving the rating of A-OK.",

But if you're looking for a memorable meal, I would suggest that you keep on stumbling down Fremont Street.  As this place bills itself as a \"fish house,\" my husband got his standard order of fish and chips. The fish was pretty tasty but WAY overcooked. Same with my mini burger sampler. There were four blackened burgers, and I just happened to eat them in order from worst to best: cheese, BBQ sauce & bacon, teriyaki & pineapple, and guacamole. Great guac, but it would have been better served on chips instead of burgers.  This looks like a fun place to grab a drink and listen to some music, but I would skip the food.",

They have giant margaritas and a 60-ounce beer (basically a pitcher in a glass shape without a handle).  Notice there are no prices on this giant drink menu.  One person in our group asked the price of a drink on the menu and the server said 'I couldn't tell you.'  Are you friggin kidding me.  Well being with the group we didn't want to complain to go somewhere else so we went with the flow.  I got the 60 ounce beer - note which is the same as 5 bottles of beer.  You better start chugging or an hour later you are going to be drinking warm beer.    How much was the beer?  $30!  So not a great deal, $6 a beer.  I would have preferred to drink 5 individual cold beers.    We did get the tacos.  Lots of shrimp on the shrimp tacos.  The fish tacos were okay, decent size but they put TARTER SAUCE on it.  YUK.  Fish tacos are supposed to have a white sauce but not sweet relishy tarter sauce!    1 star for the live music (although good luck hearing what anyone at the table is saying) and 1 star for not skimpy on the shrimp on the shrimp tacos.",

I've owned about 15 bars in my life and this is the rudest person I've ever come across. I ordered a round of shots and she filled up plastic disposable cups about 1/4\" with liquor and try to pass it off as a full shot. I told her that the pours were about half and she got super pissy. I said it's easy to resolve just prove it and pour them in shot glasses and it will be obvious. She refused. At that point I said ok then I don't want them and I walked away and went back to my group. 10 minutes later we decided to leave when the music stopped and she sent security after me saying I didn't pay my tab, for the short pour shots I declined to take. Horrible horrible place. I will never go back.",

We think Kelsey forgot to enter our order because all the surrounding tables were eating. Additionally they were out of crackers. When one of your menu offerings is Clam Chowder, you should never run out of crackers! Lastly, my side was chips and salsa. I received a half-full ramekin of salsa that lasted 4 chips. I asked for two more sides and was charged a quarter per without being pre-notified. The salsa wasn't even that good.  My return here for future meals is doubtful. This was my third time dining here and SERVICE is consistently LACKING.",

Service was ok at first but a little slow as the night went on  Where the problem really was ,was with the food and  supposedly this was a \"whole new menu \" according to the waitress . Surprisingly   almost everyone ordered the same meal it was a Teriyaki rice bowl .It sounded great rice veggies and chicken . A nice healthy late evening dinner .  When it arrived we were first surprised to see how small it was . Then even more surprised to see how bad it was . The rice was clumpy  like it was premade in the morning .The only veggie was broccoli and it was limp . The chicken was a Mexican style where it was shredded ,and if you put all yours on your plate back together it would have been less than an ounce .When we were asked how our meals were I told her it was probably the worst meal I had ever had . And we all felt the same . She seemed surprised but not overly concerned .   When we first entered we had asked to put two tables together and I saw the waitress check with a man sitting near the front . She informed me he was the Manager . I am not sure if he was working but he did sit their the whole time drinking and smoking with some female patron .And that was all he did . He was never informed by our waitress of our review ,and we had waited so long for our bill we didn't bother to press the issue    If this is a new menu ...didn't anyone try out this dish . If they did ...did they think it was good ? I am sure a high school cooking student could turn out a better more imaginative dish . Was this new menu item designed so as to use less than a dollars worth of  ingredients l . I will only have to imagine what the others items are like based on this one ,as I will not chance trying them .",

She ordered a Crown Royal on the rocks. The bartender said nothing, brought her the drink and said \"eleven dollars\"! My wife asked why she was being charged when she was playing a machine and finally at that point he told her \"you have to put $20 in the machine to get your drink on the house\". I have no doubt he's been trained to rip off people in this manner. Rather telling her up front that $20 was required, he allowed her to order the drink and then grossly overcharged her for it. Furthermore, while Crown is a higher end blended Canadian whiskey, charging $11 for a single shot of it is thievery of the highest magnitude. I HIGHLY recommend anyone reading this avoid these scam artist thieves at all possible costs (to your wallet). Would give zero stars if possible.",

She wasn't busy at all. Second of all, the drinks are way overpriced. I ordered a vodka soda, a dirty martini and a bud light bottle. My bill was $27! The vodka soda came in a tiny 10 oz cup. When I asked why it was so expensive she said will the martini was $13 and the bud light bottle is $6.25. I was shocked. I would expect this from somewhere on the strip maybe but not this run down tiki bar. My family ordered 3 beers from their outside bar and they were charged $33!   I can't comment on the food since we didn't eat there but definitely do not go there for drinks. If they are going to charge that much they really need to step up their game. I will never go back.",

After looking at the menu, we decided to take a seat. After a while, a waitress came and took our drink order. About 3 minutes later, she ran to our table, ducked down and stated that she didn't want to talk to the creeper on the patio are so was pretending like she was working. Strike one, she could have been actually working and getting our drinks. We were not amused. There were only about 3 tables of people in the place as well. After she dropped off our drinks, she went back to talking with the guys by the patio (who were clearly just there to talk and not order).  She returned and took our order. I had my heart set on the crab cake sliders, but she said they were out of crab cakes. We went with a bucket of fries, fish tacos, and a chicken quesadilla. Once the food was delivered, the waitress walked away. My friend noticed her chicken quesadilla was actually steak. We waved down the waitress, and she grabbed the plate and said she could bring another. A bit later she returned and dropped off the quesadilla. It was another steak quesadilla...and cold. We waved down the waitress again and told her it was steak again and to just take it off the bill. She looked at my friend and said, \"well then, the first one was chicken\" and walked away. No apology, just attitude. It was clearly not chicken either time. She returned, literally threw the book with the check on it on the table and walked away, saying nothing else.   We tracked down a manager, who took care of the tab. She also stated she spoke to the server. We could tell, considering she was staring down the table behind the manager. We got up and left, never planning on returning again.  I have worked in the food industry, as well as managed restaurants. I have never experienced such an awful visit or server in my life!",

Good selection of beers and specialty cocktails. My wife had the Baja Taco's. Her comment was finally enough red cabbage on a fish Taco to get the peppery flavor. Our other guests had burgers and a wrap.  They both enjoyed them and thought the serving size was right.  Both boys thought the tater tots were very good. I had the Atlantic Ale Beer Batter Fish and Chips.  The batter was a little heavy for a beer batter, a little more beer in the batter would be helpful.  The fish was cooked properly but the batter of over fried and oil was dripping out when you bit into it. Maybe oil temp to low and they left it in to long?  I'm not a fry cook so not sure. Service was a little slow considering the place only had about 5 tables filled and 3 servers that I could see.",

It literally just tasted like club soda and lime (with a small hint of mint). It was the worst. I just got a bottled beer instead. You can't mess that up. -Service is pretty slow.",

    "text": "Service: The quickest service with a cute smile I have ever experienced. Me and my date walked in and were seated and had our drink orders in under 5 mins. There were some girls giving away Pineapple Vodka shots and gave us free merch. Server gave us enough time to look over menu but we were undecided so she made suggestions, glad we took them. Food was quick and so was the next round of drinks.   Food: Amazing! I had the rotisserie Chicken Quesadilla, while my date had the steak. The meat in both was juicy and so Flavorful . (usually pulled chicken can be dry, this was anything but.)  For our entree we got the Carne Asada taco plate. We were not disappointed with that either. Meat was moist and the portion was perfect.   Atmosphere: Band was playing, they were pretty good. Place was pretty busy and the wait staff was keeping everyone happy and cheery.   Price: Very affordable = cheap. In Vegas its hard to eat on a small budget, this place makes it easy to get full and still keep the bill under $50 for 2. (with cocktails and appetizers, skip these 2 and you're guaranteed a good, filling cheap meal)  We ate here 2 more times during our 1 week stay and we tried other menu items with the same experience as our first. We will be eating here again the next trip as it has become our must dine place on Fremont.",

    "text": "Visited Mickie Finnz last weekend with some friends who were visiting from out of town. This wouldn't be my first \"go to\" spot if ever visiting The Fremont Experience. I'd probably stumble into this spot after visiting Commonwealth or other places down the street first.   Mickie Finnz has that beachy vibe with tiki-ish huts and island like drinks. The night I visited it was Latin Night, which was cool (every Friday from 9p-close) b/c everyone was dancing and all about it! They do offer outdoor seating so that you can people watch while enjoying a drink under the misters. This is nice especially during a hot Las Vegas summer night.   I didn't really like the vibes from the servers and even the bartenders. They were not friendly and they didn't really smile. You can feel the attitude and it just wasn't a good vibe. That's the only downfall, which is a big component as to if I would return to an establishment or not.   Like I said, this wouldn't be my starting point when visiting Fremont St - I just wouldn't waste my time.",

The bartender was kind of short with us and other patrons.  Not rude, just...there.We weren't too hungry so we just got an appetizer of coconut shrimp. The shrimp were okay. The sauce that they were served with was the best part.  Loved the sauce. The tiniest mojito is $12. Seems a bit steep to me.  Between the prices and the food I would say this place was meh.",

We walked up and were told we could sit wherever we wanted. With the weather being perfect we grabbed a table outside. The menus are already at the table.  We ordered dynamite shrimp tacos, chicken caesar salad, and 2 orders of fish & chips. The food was outstanding. The fish & shrimp were fresh, the salad was huge, and portions were great.  Our waitress Anna was great. She kept up with the drinks and answered any questions we had as we had a vegan/pescaterian in the group.  This place is definitely a spot I'll visit on my next trip to Vegas.",

My +1 and I were staying nearby at the Golden Nugget, and we decided to walk Fremont and maybe get a bite to eat within walking distance. We stumbled upon this place while walking around.  The inside looked like a typical tropical fish house with wooden decor, but we chose to sit outside and people watch. The table and seats were clean. The waitress was pretty quick and responsive, and brought us a couple bottles of Guinness.  We ordered calamari, which came with 3 different sauces, a sweet & sour, a dill sauce, and a spicy mayo(?) which were all delicious.  I ordered fish & chips which were decent. The fish wasn't over-battered or greasy. My +1 ordered the ahi sliders which were surprisingly good.  Overall, the place didn't wow us for the price, but the food was good and the location is convenient.",

Also loved the music playing while we were dining in. Would come back when we plan to go downtown again!",

It gets 4 stars for service and good spot to people watch! Will definitely come back.",

The husband and I stop by Mickie Finnz while walking thru downtown, happy hour prices were amazing.The best in town our server Maricela was extremely attentive and suggested the street tacos since they were also on happy hour they were delicious (but not enough to share if your hungry) the plate comes with a combo of 3 tacos: one chicken, one steak as well as a fish. We also decided on the shrimp taco plate with Maricela's approval, she said the tacos(2) had plenty of shrimp and we would be satisfied. They were amazing and they did not go cheap with the shrimp they had a spicy sauce that complimented the plate extremely well and we were definetly full and happy!!!",

I have better luck getting a bartenders time of day at Hakkasan or Omnia (and this place was empty). We would order two drinks and the waitress would slam one on the table and walk away. So, up to the bar I go to get the other persons drink so him and I can drink at the same time like normal people. It wasn't until we were about 4 drinks (each) in that the waitress became nice and I assume it's because she was calculating that we were on our way to spending over $100.",

    "text": "Stopped in with a friend for an afternoon bite after hitting the Zappos Downtown Showdown...mostly because it was close by and they had a newbie check-in special on Foursquare: Free appetizer with the purchase of an entree and beverage. My friend and I decided to share. We were told that our entree could only be ordered from a specific area of the menu to get the check-in special.  We ordered the Maui Beach Balls appetizer. Deep-fried balls of something (I think there may have been some shrimp and cheese in them) that came with 3 dipping sauces. They were \"ok\".  For our entree we ordered Baja Shrimp which was described as seasoned and grilled and accompanied by pineapple rice and a vegetable. What we got was some sort of taco plate, which wasn't part of the designated section we were told we had to order from. (I thought it was strange when the waitress asked if we wanted sour cream and guacamole with our grilled shrimp, but I just thought \"Okaaaay...\" and asked for it on the side.) Anyway, I sent it back because that's not what I ordered.   So then the correct entree showed up. The shrimp were grilled, I guess, but not in the least bit seasoned. Not even with salt. Or garlic. Or butter. Or citrus. Or anything even remotely Baja-like. There might have been a minute amount of pepper. They were flavorless, chewy and dry. They tasted like the wood skewers they came on. The pineapple rice was very pineapple-y but also very dry. The vegetable accompaniment was broccoli, which was actually phenomenal. VERY flavorful.  It was the best thing on the plate.  The service was meh. But we still tipped over 20% because we're locals and that's just how we roll.  Shout-out to Jeremiah, who was on stage doing an acoustic guitar set. He was funny and a talented singer/guitarist. And the reason I'm giving Mickie Finnz 3 stars instead of 2.",

When I first entered up the stairs I thought we were at Hennessey's so I find the set up a little confusing but apparently all the food comes from the same kitchen anyways.  I did not see the bill breakdown because my boyfriend paid but $20 for Nachos and two soft drinks.  The Nachos were priced at $11.95 so I guess a diet coke is about $3.   They could have used a few more chips to make the ratio of chips to toppings more proportionate.  Also not a fan of leaving cash for the bill and the waitress not bringing back change.  It's just not cool to assume the entire overage is the tip.",

For $2 ..if you are successful they will prepare it for you! We tried but in vain and we had fun, felt a little sorry for the lobsters :( the food wasn't great hence the 4stars. We ordered Macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi- pan seared topped with roasted pineapple salsa, served with rice and sauteed veggies. That Mahi Mahi was cooked too done to our liking. Shrimp Bowl-sauteed shrimp in South Sea sauce,fresh pineapple, red bell pepper, over sticky rice drizzled with sriracha was too spicy. I don't remember having an indication of being spicy. Our friends ordered Tacos which was ok and Ahi dish that was really good. We came here end of August walking around in downtown and looking for place to eat and decided to check in.

    "text": "My mom and I stopped by for a quick bite before we walked up and down the Fremont Experience. We decided this place looked appetizing and stopped in and sat in a booth. We sat for 20 minutes waiting for a server, and when she did finally come, she wasn't friendly and asked if we were ready to order. Now, I've worked in two restaurants so I understand some servers aren't as peppy and we all have bad days. I ordered a Caesar salad and my mom the fish and chips. THEN the food didn't come out for at least 20 minutes and we were already irritated. Server who dropped off the food was pleasant and asked how it looked. Food was decent despite the fish looking a little bland and overlooked. Not once did our server come by to check on us and see how things were. When she would come and fill up a drink, she didn't even stop; she just grabbed our cups and walked away without a word. Then I waited...and waited...for my own water refill. A. Water. Refill. And she barely put any ice. I'm typically not picky but as a server I was appalled she didn't talk to us at all but talked to other people and asked how they were. She was at the bar dancing the whole time we waited for a check...which was probably another 30 minutes. My mom had to get the check and then she came by, didn't say anything, and grabbed it. Then she was at the booth next to us and just dropped off our check without a word or even stopping by OUR booth to drop it. I was beyond angry and I never EVER leave a bad tip because I hate when that happens. But I did last night because it was ridiculous and it wasn't even busy and she treated us like nothing from the start. Will not likely ever come back here and if I do, I'm definitely speaking to the manager or whoever is on duty because it was appalling they let people like that work here. They're lucky they got one star because they don't even deserve that.",

Here a few common threads:  The hostess every time has been less than friendly - borderline rude.  The expensive bottled beer is warm.  The waitresses seem to be bothered to serve you as they seem more busy socializing with friends. Two of the four times I have been here - my arm stuck to the table.  When you ask some to clean it up its been a half-assed job at best. Then the food... The last time I was here, the chips in salsa were terrible.  The chips look like the busted up remnants from the bottom of a bulk SAMs Club bag.  The salsa seemed like store bought hot sauce in tiny containers.  Good luck getting another one.  I ordered the fish tacos and I am sitting here the next day with that great food poisoning feeling.  There are countless choices here on Fremont St.  Pass this one by!",

We took some relatives from out of town here while they visited Fremont. I am actually embarrassed we took them here. I felt so ashamed having to explain how cool this place was a year ago after the service and food we got. Its pretty much over priced under par bar food, for out of town- drunks who know no better.  Everything started out fine, till our food took really long. There were only 3 tables of people in the place, and a few on the patio. It wasn't busy. AT ALL, Tuesday night.  We saw another angry table of people complaining that their food was taking forever. So we complained a little too. They really had no excuse, the place was dead.  As soon as the bitching started they jumped into action swarming our table like bees, filling our water cups and such. Not sure why we had to bitch to get this kind of service. It was soo awkward and embarrassing. The manager jumped in and served our food. They really tried to accommodate us, and we did appreciate that. But like why do we have to ask for service? Made everything uncomfortable from there on.... The food tasted bleh. Not worth the gas I got later on. The shrimp and chips were frozen shrimp, and if they weren't geezus help us cause I don't know what that was. My aunt ordered a pizza, and it was like something you would get at the skating rink. My cousin got the sliders, huge bun , turd sized burger with no taste.  The chicken in my nachos tasted like cat food. ( forgot to order no chicken - it was my fault.)  This place is either going to shut down, or get a visit from Jon Taffer and the show Bar Rescue. If that does happen I hope the first thing he does IS TAKE AWAY THAT HORRIBLE LOBSTER TORTURE TANK. ANIMAL CRUELTY AND ITS SOOOOO DISGUSTING TO WATCH PEOPLE TRY TO CATCH HELPLESS ANIMALS WITH A METAL CLAW.   I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. AS LONG AS THAT INHUMANE  LOBSTER TANK IS STILL THERE.",

The waitress came to the table quickly and took our order , I orderd steak quesadilla and my daughter got a parmesan crusted Tilapia . She brougt out our food when she got to the table she dropped half the quesadilla right on to the floor she said she would get another one but i did not trust that she didnt just put it on another plate when she brought it in the kitchen , My daughters tilapia was not even cooked , it was totally raw inside . I asked for the check for the beer I had because we werent staying , a manager came over , who really looked like he was strill partying from the night before , he was rude and unprofessional , he offered to prepare something else but I told him I would not trust anything that comes out of that kitchen .. Overall a very bad experience and it would be interesting to know what the health dept would have to say abouit this place . Do yourself a favor and steer far away from this place . It wouldnt surprise me if they were out of business in 6 months ,I will say the only positive thing about this shi''hole was the live acoustic guitar player/singer , he was the only talent in the place",

The waiter came back at 11:58pm and said \"By the way the kitchen is closed\". I asked what time does the kitchen close and she said 12am. I told her it wasn't fair that we were sitting for 15 minutes and no one helped us in time. The manager (Jessica) came over and apologized and said they are busy. Sounds like a sorry excuse for wanting to leave early. Anyone who is seated prior to 12am should be served. Ridiculous excuse for a resturant.",

Big mistake! We sat down and after quite a few minutes we were greeted by a server named Jamie I believe. Naturally as we have been in the heat all day we start to order drinks. The first four people order water. Without saying anything to guest 5 and 6, she rolls her eyes and storms away from the table without allowing them to order. We were all completely astounded by her behavior. Seriously? 105 degrees and you're annoyed we want water? We had all planned on ordering beers but we were so disgusted by her crappy attitude we all passed. I wanted to leave straight away but as a group we decided to stay. The mood was extremely awkward for the next few minutes. I don't typically get worked up about bad service however these are friends of mine. My wife and I invited them to come out with us. Not the hospitality we expected. We stayed and the food was okay at best. Don't waste your time. Might be a decent place minus the exceptionally poor service.",

After we placed our order she returned with the one drink that was ordered about 10-15 minutes later. That was it.... we never saw her, our food, or so much as the bill to pay for the one drink again.  After sitting there for a solid hour we left. I wouldn't recommend anyone else go in at all.

Grilled fish tacos are extremely spicy and some bites tasted almost like fishy ocean water, the good bites did taste okay as long as you didn't eat the fish plain, you have to eat it as the taco or it really isn't good; the chips they give you with it tasted like grease and they don't give you salsa or pico de gallo with it; if they were supposed to, I wouldn't know because the waitress didn't come to check to see how anything was. Would I go back? NO WAY",

Although the live music is great and our server was super friendly, the food is totally flavorless. And let's be real, you're here to eat. Not to listen to music and make friends with the bartender.  Our party of 3 ordered the chips and guacamole and the mini sliders to start. I'm not sure how you make guacamole taste like bland avocado mush but this place achieves that tasteless flavor. Yikes. The sliders were dry and burnt but still incredibly pink inside. How does that work out? All the ketchup and mustard in the world couldn't make these sliders taste good! With how awful everything was, I thought it would be safe to order the chicken BLTA. WRONG. Worst chicken BLTA I've had IN MY LIFE. Hockey puck bread, old lettuce and tomato, microwaved chicken breast. I took 2 bites and was done. Friends ordered the chicken enchiladas and they had similar things to say about their dish.  You'd have to pay me to eat here again.",

At 5:30 pm on Friday night our waitress claims they are not doing Happy Hour!?!  What?  There are menus at each table (picture included here) that cite 7pm as the cut off time.  Further, our waitress continued to perform a disappearing act all evening.  She did not check on us even once!  Next, it took 45 mins for food to come.  When it did arrive, it was lukewarm.  The steak and burgers were medium (picture included) instead of medium well (very little pink).  With prices as high as Las Vegas Strip side restaurants, this place does not live up at all in atmosphere,  service, or food.  Never again!",

    "text": "Another Fremont street restaurant disappoints me.   We were visiting with friends and wanted to get a bite to eat and some drinks.   Located on the south end of Fremont, it wasn't very busy and easy to find a table.   It took a while for the waitress to initially greet us and take orders.  We decided on starting with their Killer Nachos for the table to share.   They came with cheese, chicken, black beans, jalapenos and sour cream.    They were just ok and kind of dry.  There were very little black beans and chicken.  I'd wished they were served with salsa to give it something.    For my entree I wanted to try their mini burgers.  They don't come with any side so I ordered some fries also.  There were four burgers - one with cheese, one with guacamole, one with bacon and one with teriyaki/pineapple.  I should have read the menu more closely because I thought each burger had all of these toppings on it.  The little buns were very dry and the burger itself lacked flavor.   Very disappointing.  The fries were probably the only thing I could enjoy.  They are served in a bucket that we all shared because there were so many.  Husband said their fish tacos were also less than par.     Service also lacked here.  They had no problem noticing when the others beers were empty but it took them a long time to refill my water.  I wished for more from them and was let down.  Sad to say that I was eyeing up the restaurant across the street while eating.  Unfortunate.",

    "text": "For a party of 12, we expected slow service. But wow, this was slow x10. After we were seated it took at least 20 minutes to have our waitress come over and take our drink orders. I ordered a mojito that tasted more like lime juice and sugar so I ordered another shot of Bacardi rum to add to the drink and it tasted like a normal mojito after that. Not worth the $8.50 for a shot just to add to an already $10 drink though. Also not worth the 20 minute wait for an extra shot. Everyone elses drinks in our party seemed fine. Our waitress came back for our orders at least 35 minutes after we got our drinks. It took another hour to get our food.  None of us ordered appetizers. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos. They came with a dipping cup of blackbeans. They were tasty and spicy, but the little cup was a joke. Two of the people in our party returned their Surf N Turf because it was cold, not luke warm, but cold. Another person returned her food because the bacon was more raw than cooked and her sliders were also cold. We were not all about to wait another hour for their food to be recooked so they ended up eating some leftover nachos from someone else in our party. I didn't taste those but they were all eaten so it seemed to taste good.  Our waitress heard all of our complaints out, but definitely didn't care that much. She helped with what she could and was pretty busy. She ended up bringing out a bunch of shots on the house that consisted of vodka and some sort of fruit juice. Cheap vodka, but a nice gesture to salvage getting a decent tip.  Music was okay and other times annoying. We left just as the band started on a Sunday night.",

Sat in off the patio so we can watch the crazy foot traffic on Freemont Street. We looked at the menu, seemed great. We waited. Saw a few other groups seated, but surprisingly the place was empty. And we waited. Chicken necked around to look at other tables food...stomach growling and we waited some more. Just as we were ready to say forget it, a waitress offered to take our drink order. So we order a couple of beers. And waited.........waited..........waited. The bartenders seemed to be busy pouring, but it was for the street bar. Finally our waters came....still no drinks. Seemed like there were other customers feeling as antsy as we were to get service. Noticed some waitress was texting in the corner by the bar, even some girls clocking in it seemed, even though it was 10pm. Finally our beers came, being so hungry we opted for Chips n Salsa before we ordered any further because our experience so far was not good. The chips came quickly. Guacamole and salsa were great, chips on the other hand were stale. I really wanted this place to be great - being from the Huntington Beach, CA area I loved the surfer vibe and the menu looked great. We decided to leave and sadly our night ended up waiting again for the check. An hour and a 1/2 I will never get back. Sorry Mickie - I'm thinking this place needs a bar rescue.",

They seated us at a table that had a rotting (possibly moldy) pineaple rind next to the napkin rack. The table was wet from spilled drinks from a previous patron.  The restaurant was not even busy, so there should be no reason for the poor service.  The service was slow, to the point that we walked out after about 10 minutes of waiting to place our drink order.  Tips: (to the management) 1. Remove any rotting food from the table before seating guests. 2. Wipe down the table before seating guests. 3. Find wait staff that cares about the experience of the guests.  Tips: (to the future customers) 1. Run, don't walk, away from this place.",

    "text": "Craving the Island Fish & Chips, but decided to try something new and ordered the Crabcake Sliders instead. There are four crab sliders. Each crab patty is placed in between small Hawaiian rolls topped with a different sauce.  Slider 1 - Pico de Gallo and Chipotle Aioli:  I wasn't expecting this slider to give my mouth a spicy kick, but it did.   Slider 2 - Tarragon Caper Mayo: Surprisingly creamy, and I enjoyed the flavorful combination of the tarragon and capers.   Slider 3 - Tartar Sauce: Out of the four sliders, this was my least favorite because of the tartar sauce, which, in general, I don't like. Each slider has a unique sauce/topping, but this one was predictable.  Slider 4 - Dynamite Sauce: My favorite one out of the four. The sauce had a bold, spicy taste. To me, it captured the perfect level of spiciness (can I just order four of these on my next visit?).   As good as the sliders were, I was still hungry for more food after I finished them off. This might be something to order if you plan on eating light, but don't expect to become satiated from these.   I still think the service at this restaurant is hit-or-miss. A few visits before my most recent, I noticed waitresses arguing and swearing (take it to the alley!), and some who just seem indifferent about serving customers. But on my recent visit, the service was much better. Our waitress was outgoing and knowledgeable about the menu and just did an overall great job serving our table.",

We really enjoyed the relaxing feel with surfboards, lobster tanks, and the customer service was extraordinary. Everyone was really nice, always checking to see that we had enough sauce, ice water, we will bring our friends next time.",

If you like grapefruit do yourself a favor and try a salty dog or greyhound made with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice! I was admittedly a little scared to eat raw fish at an Irish pub in the middle of the desert, but my friends just had to have the poke, so we ordered it and boy was I wrong. Not only was the poke fresh, but it was perfectly seasoned! Service was great. Would definitely go back if I were in the area. Minus 1 star due to the bar feeling a little grimy like every good Irish pub should...not saying it's a bad thing, I actually like a little grime every now and then, I just can't give it a full 5.",

    "text": "My friends,my Mom and I ventured into this Fish House located along the Freemont Street Experience before a large lighted \"Las Vegas\" neon sign. A Carribean-Mexican Beach-style Fish House restaurant, bar/pub that offers live band music starting at 10 p.m. Climb up low wooden stairs to a verandah-type patio decorated with mini lights. There is option to dine in this patio or walk into the dining area that surrounds the main bar area in the center of the restaurant. Colorful seaside paintings adorn the walls. Electric-lighted paper lanterns decorate the bar. Signature cocktails, beer, and specialty drinks are offered on the menu along with soups, salads, munchies, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, taco plates, seafood buckets, fresh fish dinners, steaks, side dishes, desserts, hot and cold beverages. Atmosphere is cozy with tables and booth type-seatings. Carribean, hip-hop, rock pop music plays when the live band music is not playing. Large TV displays a music channel or sports on its monitor.  The night we dined I ordered the Fish Tacos meal and a lemonade soda which was served in a tall glass...it was sour and sweet as lemonade should be. Not watered down taste. The Fish Tacos here was just right for me (but it could have been better). It was served with chips on the side. The multi-colors of the chips may have put me on a \"good mood.\" I wouldn't recommend the soup my Mom and my girl friend ordered, as it tasted salty and was cold. Can't tell you what the soup is named as they themselves decided to just forget about it!, or rather as a New Yorker would say, \"Fohwwwgehhhdtttdabouttitt!!\" My girl friend & I's male friend had burger sliders and he said it was simply good enough to eat. He is the kind of person to eat burgers a lot and he found it just satisfying enough. So enough said with the food!  Mega-jumbo size cocktail can be taken home as it is in a souvenir take-home glass. Just take the second-hand smoke in if you really care to dine here. Otherwise, it's a pleasant experience. The Freemont Street Experience Light Show, people watching, other live band music playing on its stages, variety stores, the entertaining crowd will entice you to linger more around Freemont Street (I'd rather like to go on a culture crawl).",

Went in and sat down and then sat there for close to 10 minutes and watched other customers coming in after me being waited on and served ahead of me.  Not having the luxury of time to sit around and wait I decided to leave.  A blonde waitress asked me on my way out why I was leaving?  When I commented that I was on my lunch break and didn't have time to wait for others coming in behind me to get served ahead of me.  At that point in time a young rude black haired waitress interjected into the conversation I was having with the blonde waitress: \"Go ahead leave.  We don't serve or want your kind here anyways!\"  Although the food was good, service is rather slow and waitresses are rude that will be the LAST time I ever go there or recommend that place.",

I wrote the name down but in my inebriated state I missed placed that name :-) oops....So that just means if you want to hang out, drink some beers, grub on some decent food and listen to a good cover band head over and check them out yourself :-) Don't forget to tip them....you rocked out to them then you should show love and tip them ;-)",

Although the servers are pleasant they have forgotten a side of ranch or sour cream every time I have visited.  The worst thing about it is the live music. I thought I would love it, but five minutes into the meal when you have to yell at the person sitting next to you because the music is so loud, I am over it. I love the idea of live music and I would go back if it wasn't so loud. After the first night there I only order them to go.",

The baked potato was good (as if you could screw up a baked potato). The steak was pretty lean, not Kobe beef by any means but what do you really expect for $9.99. It wasn't bad at all, I've had worse and paid more.   * as a side note, they cook their steaks a little well, so if you like medium, get it medium rare that's what I did. My husband got his medium which was more like medium well...............Lucky for me after 3 glasses of ale , he doesn't get too bothered by a thing like that :-)   Anyway our server was attentive, the bar tender was personable, and with the patio seating you can't beat Freemont street people watching.   Their house band was playing, we didn't catch their names but they were really good. The patio also has a little fire pit, it's a nice spot to just chill( pardon the 90's verbiage).   The ale is a good deal @ $4 a glass, its on the sweeter side but still light. I think it tastes like a sweet Corona, my husband says it tastes like OLD- E, I don't know because I've never had OLD -E and don't plan on it. However if anyone out there has had OLD -E , and tries the house ale @ Mickie Finnz , please let me know if its similar or if my husband is just having PTSD from too much malt liquor in his youth. :-)",
